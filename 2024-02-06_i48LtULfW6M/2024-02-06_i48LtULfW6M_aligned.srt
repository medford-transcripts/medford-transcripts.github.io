1
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:05,451
for its triennial review of our English learner education programs.

2
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:16,957
Our EL director, Mr. Paul Teixeira, and his team will be working with DESE evaluators and Medford staff and faculty to facilitate this important review.

3
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:26,321
DESE was out visiting schools today, the Mississippi, the McGlynn Middle, the McGlynn Elementary School, and Medford High School.

4
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:30,362
and they'll continue their work throughout this week.

5
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:38,483
Also, just another reminder, it's critically important for us as a district, kindergarten registration.

6
00:00:38,503 --> 00:00:43,805
I will continue to mention that kindergarten registration is ongoing.

7
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:55,007
It's critically important for us to be able to start the school year strong and have as close an accurate count to the amount of students that will be enrolling for next year.

8
00:00:56,067 --> 00:01:07,651
There will be a Zoom meeting on Tuesday, February 27th at 6.30 p.m., and an in-person meeting on Thursday, March 28th at 6.30 p.m.

9
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:13,693
Child care and interpretation services are available for those meetings.

10
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:20,601
And thank you to all of those who already participated in our first session.

11
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:23,623
Just a few important save the dates.

12
00:01:24,764 --> 00:01:31,489
Again, this week, February 5th through February 9th is kindergarten report card conferences.

13
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:41,876
Again, this is the first time that parents of kindergarten students get to meet with their teachers and get caught up to speed on how their student is doing.

14
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:45,178
That is taking place this week at all of our schools.

15
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:52,302
On February 6th, tomorrow, that is our 100th day of school.

16
00:01:52,902 --> 00:02:01,346
So students will be celebrating 100 days and a lot of fun activities for our students scheduled for tomorrow.

17
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:06,449
Also, February 19th through 23rd is our February break.

18
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:07,690
There is no school.

19
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:16,897
So for tonight's meeting, during this evening's meeting, we'll discuss a number of ongoing projects and important district priorities.

20
00:02:17,718 --> 00:02:34,932
The McGlynn Playground construction and fundraising drive, the status of this year's school committee goals, and the timeline for Medford's participation in the first phase of the MSBA core program for the renovation or rebuilding of Medford High School.

21
00:02:36,013 --> 00:02:52,056
But first, through you, Madam Chair, I'll invite Assistant Superintendent Dr. Peter Cushing to take the floor to present a recommendation on the creation of a job description for an important new post in the Food Service Department.

22
00:02:52,636 --> 00:02:53,036
Thank you.

23
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:55,297
Mayor.

24
00:02:57,137 --> 00:02:57,737
Member Roussell.

25
00:02:57,897 --> 00:02:58,598
Motion to approve.

26
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,078
Motion to approve the job description.

27
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,459
Before we take a roll call,

28
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:07,516
or call the roll.

29
00:03:07,576 --> 00:03:10,118
Could you please just give us an update, Dr. Cushing?

30
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:10,478
Thank you.

31
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,260
Absolutely.

32
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,521
Thank you, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee.

33
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:18,423
I really appreciate this opportunity to present this to you this evening.

34
00:03:19,364 --> 00:03:20,605
The Medford Public

35
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,690
I apologize.

36
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:33,714
The Medford Public Schools Food Service Program has really undergone a significant transformation in the first portion of this year under our newly hired director, Retta Smith.

37
00:03:34,535 --> 00:03:39,337
We're greatly appreciative of her work and the work of our managers in each of our schools.

38
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:47,561
However, in order to take our program to the next level, we really do need a position, the assistant director of food services.

39
00:03:48,121 --> 00:04:02,332
to really help with this ongoing transformation to continue to look at the facility needs within our kitchens and cafeterias, the quality of food that we're serving and the support of all of our staff across the kitchens and cafeterias.

40
00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:07,516
So respectfully request the approval of this new position under this job description.

41
00:04:08,557 --> 00:04:09,417
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

42
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:13,640
So it's a new position and the form says it's through a donation.

43
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,402
Is that a mistake, a typo?

44
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:21,521
we recommend the school committee approve this generous and appreciated donation to the Medford Public Schools.

45
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,182
That must be a typo.

46
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:29,988
Can you just confirm the funding will come out of the

47
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,931
Yes, so that we were discussing earlier.

48
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:41,337
Okay, so food services, the best way that I can describe it in public parlance is almost runs as an enterprise account.

49
00:04:42,398 --> 00:04:51,885
And so as a self sustaining business within the district, that the program under law is not supposed to run in the red.

50
00:04:52,365 --> 00:05:12,960
So it is upon the management of the district and the department itself to ensure that this program operates either at break-even or with maintaining some surplus that DESE has very specific and the United States Department of Agriculture both have very specific rules and regulations on how much we can have in reserve.

51
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:16,562
Thank you.

52
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:17,523
Dr. Cushing.

53
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:20,105
Member Reinfeldt.

54
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:24,317
So this is partly a procedural question.

55
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:31,713
Do we ask comments about the job description that's written, or is this just a pass?

56
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:34,965
Has this been posted?

57
00:05:35,906 --> 00:05:39,127
We have not posted because I didn't want to post anything without approval of the body.

58
00:05:39,347 --> 00:05:41,688
So yeah, remember I felt you could ask questions.

59
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:42,829
I had a couple questions.

60
00:05:43,429 --> 00:05:48,111
Just a question around the practice of salary measure of experience.

61
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:50,792
Do we ever post salary ranges for things?

62
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:52,273
I'm curious.

63
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:53,834
Measure it for with

64
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:57,099
We don't post salary ranges.

65
00:05:57,619 --> 00:05:57,899
Okay.

66
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:02,020
So that's a, that's a different conversation then about practices around that.

67
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:10,943
Um, and then I was, I just wanted to ask about it's in the knowledge of progressive approach to enhance student dining experiences.

68
00:06:10,963 --> 00:06:16,204
And I'm curious what that means and whether that means culturally inclusive or culturally sensitive.

69
00:06:16,504 --> 00:06:17,264
Oh, absolutely.

70
00:06:17,925 --> 00:06:19,285
So I'm wondering if that language,

71
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:21,773
can be added.

72
00:06:22,493 --> 00:06:24,475
Progressive feels very big to me.

73
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:27,519
I also know that Director Smith is online.

74
00:06:29,641 --> 00:06:37,128
Get my computer and I can unmute her or actually, I believe Director Smith, I made you a co-host if the chair wants to.

75
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:40,111
Hi, I'm here.

76
00:06:52,878 --> 00:07:03,125
Director Smith, you're coming in pretty loud, so do you wanna give us any information on member Reinfeld's question?

77
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:07,527
Sorry, now I'm trying to whisper.

78
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:09,669
I don't want it to be too loud.

79
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,469
Can you hear me?

80
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,010
Yes.

81
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:13,832
Okay.

82
00:07:14,572 --> 00:07:19,015
Yes, so I think you're correct, progressive is a very broad term.

83
00:07:19,597 --> 00:07:28,924
So that would be culturally inclusive, maybe looking at different styles of distributing food, especially at the high school level.

84
00:07:28,964 --> 00:07:37,130
So just trying to do things in a way that best meets the needs of the students and the facilities.

85
00:07:40,473 --> 00:07:41,073
Great, thank you.

86
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:46,677
So do you want to amend and make it culturally inclusive?

87
00:07:47,658 --> 00:07:48,899
Yes, I motion to.

88
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:52,348
or to add culturally inclusive in that.

89
00:07:52,928 --> 00:07:54,069
Sorry, point of procedure.

90
00:07:54,209 --> 00:08:03,092
I think first we had the motion on the floor for this, and I had seconded the approval, but I just want to say for not a motion, but an amendment, right?

91
00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:04,532
Is that what's being suggested?

92
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:08,734
Yeah, motion for approval by Member Russo, seconded by Member Laughlin, as amended by Member McIntyre.

93
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:09,294
Thank you.

94
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:11,034
Just wanted to make sure we weren't doing separate motions.

95
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:11,414
Thank you.

96
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:15,036
Any other questions on the job description?

97
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:18,637
Do we have a range, a salary range in mind?

98
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:21,867
because the city posts salary ranges.

99
00:08:21,947 --> 00:08:29,969
So, yeah, it would be in the about 57 to 63 is the neighborhood that we're thinking at present.

100
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:32,089
Thank you.

101
00:08:32,689 --> 00:08:32,889
Okay.

102
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:35,670
If there's no further questions, we're going to move approval as amended.

103
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,290
All those in favor?

104
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,051
Aye.

105
00:08:38,411 --> 00:08:39,131
All those opposed?

106
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:41,111
Motion passes as amended.

107
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:43,012
Thank you, Dr. Christian.

108
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:43,412
Thank you.

109
00:08:44,452 --> 00:08:45,832
Thank you, Director Smith.

110
00:08:48,073 --> 00:08:48,333
Thank you.

111
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,671
We have the McGlynn Playground fundraiser website update.

112
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:55,440
We have Mr. Thomas Dalton, our communications director.

113
00:08:55,842 --> 00:08:56,143
Welcome.

114
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:02,170
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

115
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,572
And through you, good evening to the members of the school committee.

116
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:14,118
As you're all aware, the district commenced construction late last year on a new playground at the McGlynn Elementary School.

117
00:09:14,859 --> 00:09:24,105
This playground, which will be the city's first universally accessible play space, will be an exciting improvement for the school community, the neighborhood, and the city at large.

118
00:09:26,141 --> 00:09:38,012
At its January 8th meeting, this committee approved a motion offered by member Graham to establish a fundraising campaign to support the ongoing construction and future maintenance and improvement needs of the McGlynn playground.

119
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:49,743
After the passage of that measure, school district staff, including the finance and business office, website, administration and development team, and the superintendent senior executive team collaborated to execute that motion.

120
00:09:51,164 --> 00:10:08,316
Our finance team under the leadership of director Jerry McHugh and accounting manager Noel Villas performed the necessary due diligence and bookkeeping to create the McGlynn playground fund, allowing the district to designate a clearly segregated destination for any funds raised from the public in this initiative.

121
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:26,043
I worked with Miss Lisa Miller vocational teacher and our MPS website administrator and associate superintendent emeritus Diane Caldwell, another MPS website veteran to establish the necessary website infrastructure to solicit donations online.

122
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:31,386
This is the first time we're soliciting charitable donations online.

123
00:10:31,446 --> 00:10:39,210
So we wanted to make sure that we looked at each step of the process and that we understood clearly how it was gonna work before we started actually soliciting the donations.

124
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,251
We were able to meet with BlueSnap.

125
00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:49,515
BlueSnap is the third party vendor which helps MPS process online receipts such as athletics user fees.

126
00:10:50,155 --> 00:10:55,197
And we created a secure online form and payment portal for donations to the Playground Fund.

127
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:07,329
Importantly, these contributions will be clearly marked as contributions to the Playground Fund, and they'll include all of the identifying information we need for donor acknowledgement.

128
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,051
Once the form was created, Ms.

129
00:11:10,091 --> 00:11:16,435
Miller and I created a webpage for the fundraiser, which is also easily reached through the main page navigation on the MPS website.

130
00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:22,339
If you're ever on the MPS website, you can find it under the Students and Families tab in the main menu.

131
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:30,627
And then moving forward, we'll regularly share information with the Medford Public Schools community on how to support the McGlynn Playground Project.

132
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:46,622
We'll be utilizing existing channels of communication such as social media and email to contact school community members, but we'll also extend our reach beyond the schools to Medford community organizations and other donors to request their support for this project.

133
00:11:47,703 --> 00:12:04,139
We're maintaining close contact with the McGlynn playground committee, the volunteers who helped plan and design and execute this project to ensure that existing channels of communication with advocates and stakeholders are still employed throughout the course of this giving campaign.

134
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:17,588
The fundraising page on the MPS website has already been added to the McGlynn Playground Committee's link tree, so their stakeholders will be able to easily access the donation page and information.

135
00:12:19,328 --> 00:12:25,150
I'd like to offer my thanks through you, Madam Mayor, to the members of the committee for authorizing and encouraging this drive.

136
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:47,356
The playground project will obviously benefit tangibly from this community financial support, but I do also think that the fundraising effort is gonna help us raise awareness about the project and excitement for this new play space, because really it comes down to this really important effort to ensure accessibility and equity in play for all of Medford's kids.

137
00:12:48,396 --> 00:12:55,422
So I'm happy to address any questions or comments that the members may have, and I thank you for the chance to present tonight.

138
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,184
Thank you, Thomas.

139
00:12:59,105 --> 00:12:59,825
Much appreciated.

140
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,088
I know the press release went out, if I may, from the chair.

141
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:06,350
Will we be doing something weekly just to remind people?

142
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:13,335
Because people sometimes see a press release, realize they have two months to donate, and then they'll forget.

143
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,598
So I just want to make sure we have a strategy for the timeline.

144
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,760
Yep, absolutely.

145
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:32,848
So I'm laying out a timeline for social media posts, additional posts to the Medford patch and kind of follow up with reporters I mean it's not always easy to get news reporters to cover local giving campaigns but

146
00:13:33,308 --> 00:13:42,117
that doesn't mean I won't keep trying and we'll continue to do different touches whether it be in the superintendent's weekly newsletter on the website.

147
00:13:42,558 --> 00:13:55,651
We'll be encouraging elementary principals in particular to include it in their principal newsletters which go out either weekly or monthly depending on the school so we'll make sure that we get it out as many avenues as we're able.

148
00:13:56,246 --> 00:13:58,888
let us in the city know what we can help with too.

149
00:13:58,908 --> 00:14:00,409
We have a monthly newsletter.

150
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:05,032
Planning Development Sustainability has a newsletter they put out every so often as well.

151
00:14:05,132 --> 00:14:05,973
So we're happy to help.

152
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:06,353
Great.

153
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:07,814
I'll make sure to be in touch with your team.

154
00:14:07,955 --> 00:14:08,435
Yeah, thanks.

155
00:14:09,235 --> 00:14:09,596
Wonderful.

156
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:11,557
So everybody, make sure we donate.

157
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,318
This is going to be a great playground.

158
00:14:13,358 --> 00:14:17,021
We've had so many of our members working hard to make this a reality.

159
00:14:18,062 --> 00:14:18,922
So yes, thank you.

160
00:14:19,043 --> 00:14:19,643
Thanks for the update.

161
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:20,023
Great.

162
00:14:20,263 --> 00:14:20,784
Thanks very much.

163
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:27,135
We have number four, the MSBA timeline overview.

164
00:14:27,215 --> 00:14:29,236
Again, I'll turn it over to Dr. Edward Vincent.

165
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:31,656
Good evening.

166
00:14:31,776 --> 00:14:37,117
This presentation, shortly, we will project for you.

167
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:38,358
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

168
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:46,340
The MSBA building process, and I want to thank all of you who have been supporting this work, and I know

169
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,521
people may wanna know where are we as a district in this process.

170
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:54,342
So this is just to give you just a brief update on that.

171
00:14:55,243 --> 00:15:05,926
So Medford Public Schools has been accepted formally, we announced it into the Massachusetts School Building Authority, MSBA eligibility process.

172
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:11,388
As you can see in the table that's being displayed, it's that first blue box.

173
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:19,913
This is a significant first step to determine the future of Medford High School's physical structure.

174
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:23,136
A little more background information.

175
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,558
This journey began for us a little bit ago.

176
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:33,503
The MSBA Statement of Interest, our SOI period, it opens annually.

177
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:39,999
for districts across the Commonwealth to submit applications to MSBA.

178
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:51,606
Medford submitted another application in the spring of 2023, last year, and provided updated facility information in the fall of 2023.

179
00:15:54,008 --> 00:16:08,962
Just in December, late December, the Medford public schools was formally invited into the eligibility process, period that first blue box by the MSBA Board of Directors.

180
00:16:10,243 --> 00:16:17,246
So there are officially seven steps that each district needs to go through.

181
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:20,388
We are currently at step number one.

182
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:29,872
So under the eligibility period for Medford Public Schools, our eligibility period begins on May 1st, 2024.

183
00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:38,018
So we still have a little bit of a runway, but it begins May 1, 2024, and it's for 270 days.

184
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:41,760
So again, that'll run from May 2024 into the beginning January-ish of 2025.

185
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,484
That will be our first eligibility period.

186
00:16:58,514 --> 00:17:08,704
a certification of the school district's understanding of the grant program rules by executing an initial compliance certification.

187
00:17:09,205 --> 00:17:23,579
Later today in the agenda, there will be a resolution regarding the formation of a school building committee, which is also a critically important step in meeting the requirements during this eligibility period.

188
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:36,150
While the MSBA allows for local communities to govern the overall composition of the school building committee, there are specific roles that are required.

189
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:46,298
The district must complete an educational profile, a questionnaire to keep MSBA informed of what's happening.

190
00:17:46,338 --> 00:17:47,860
We have to talk about our current

191
00:17:48,340 --> 00:18:02,284
and proposed educational facilities, we have to share with them the teaching methodologies that we use in Medford, discuss our grade configurations, and all of our program offerings.

192
00:18:03,045 --> 00:18:07,046
All of those things are required during the eligibility period.

193
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:16,389
We will also provide a summary of the school district's existing infrastructure repair practices.

194
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:31,781
We have to agree on the enrollment estimates, along with MSBA, because that's critically important when they're thinking about the size of the new facility, and the community is required.

195
00:18:32,262 --> 00:18:33,082
This is important.

196
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:53,678
to authorize spending by a vote during step three so eligibility period is step one step two is forming the project team which is still part of the eligibility period but also transitioning that's step two and um

197
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:16,568
During step two, one thing that's important is although we were invited and we are going to work to complete all of the eligibility requirements, it does not definitely guarantee us a spot in the MSBA's capital project pipeline.

198
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:34,962
So it's critically important that we do not miss any of our deadlines, that we meet all of the deliverables, all of the requirements during the 270 day window, in order to be able to move forward to the next phase.

199
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:47,873
If we do not, for whatever reason, hit all of the deliverables, then as a district, we would have to go back to resubmit another statement of interest.

200
00:19:48,173 --> 00:19:50,135
So we don't want that to happen at all.

201
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:54,818
And we are determined to hit all of the deliverables ahead of the deadline.

202
00:19:55,739 --> 00:19:58,922
So step two is forming the project team.

203
00:19:59,322 --> 00:20:01,624
That's what you see, the blue and the green rectangle.

204
00:20:04,252 --> 00:20:15,217
And at that time, one of the key pieces that will, key individuals that will be needed is the owner's project manager, OPM.

205
00:20:15,237 --> 00:20:20,960
And the owner project manager provides project management and guidance.

206
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:28,763
So that is a new position that we will need to seek and hire to have someone be the OPM of the project.

207
00:20:29,243 --> 00:20:32,225
That happens during step phase two, step two.

208
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:45,149
Step three is the feasibility study where they actually look at the initial space summary, look at the district's programs once again, look at existing school conditions.

209
00:20:45,469 --> 00:20:47,670
There are a lot of look at parameters.

210
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:53,352
So they go through all of that during step three, the feasibility study.

211
00:20:54,032 --> 00:21:03,540
and approval by the MSBA Board of Directors is required for all projects to proceed to the next phase.

212
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:10,686
After step three, or phase three, we move to phase four, which is the schematic design.

213
00:21:11,446 --> 00:21:14,469
Step five is funding the project.

214
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:21,895
Step six is the design, development, construction, documentation, and bidding.

215
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,598
And then step seven is actual construction.

216
00:21:26,238 --> 00:21:40,369
So again, as we have our upcoming meetings, we wanna just be able to give a little bit of information at each meeting to update and keep the community informed on the MSBA process.

217
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:48,515
Again, we are only right now in the eligibility period, step one, which is a 270 day process.

218
00:21:49,035 --> 00:21:51,257
So that's my report for this evening.

219
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:53,552
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

220
00:21:53,893 --> 00:22:03,442
Member Branley, I'm just curious on timeline overall, if I'm going to be very positive that all this goes as well as we would like it to.

221
00:22:04,142 --> 00:22:06,925
What is the timeline that we're looking for?

222
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:12,250
Ballpark, obviously, not, you know, are we looking at five years, 10 years?

223
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,173
Is this maybe my grandkids?

224
00:22:16,663 --> 00:22:29,069
I would, I mean, I know sometimes if everything, if all the ducks line up in a row, construction, if the votes and everything goes through, it may be as early as five to six years.

225
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,511
Sometimes it takes seven to eight years.

226
00:22:31,971 --> 00:22:34,852
I mean, we're gonna try to, this is Medford we're talking about.

227
00:22:35,192 --> 00:22:44,817
So we're gonna try to make sure that we hit all of our deliverables early and we will be able to get to that point of construction, member Graham.

228
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:46,001
Thank you.

229
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:46,641
Member Graham.

230
00:22:47,401 --> 00:23:00,784
The other thing the MSBA talks a lot about is five to seven is typical and average, but they also talk about some of the factors that sort of slow bog down projects.

231
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:10,946
Certainly if there's not like consensus about the project that bogs things down, but as importantly, if you are doing really complex things like consolidating

232
00:23:11,505 --> 00:23:30,343
multiple schools into one or redistricting like anything that it has to do with like sort of substantially changing the like makeup and chemistry of what goes on in the building, they sort of cite as a reason why things slow down so we don't really have that going on here too much.

233
00:23:32,205 --> 00:23:33,846
in terms of what we're seeking to do.

234
00:23:33,966 --> 00:23:49,258
So I think that's good news for us because that and those kinds of conversations obviously take the time that they take to unfold in the community and to have broad support and to think about all the impacts to all of our staff and students and all that stuff.

235
00:23:49,298 --> 00:23:54,422
So because we don't have that like the, you know, the five to seven year timeline is sort of

236
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,807
reasonable, I think, for us to expect out of this project.

237
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:17,834
And to that, when we talk a little bit later about the building committee, we're going to want to build a building committee that's committed to five instead of seven, eight, nine, 10, because there are lots and lots of kids who have been waiting really patiently for this.

238
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:19,155
We're going to miss it completely.

239
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:21,056
But more importantly,

240
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:41,095
For me, when I look at all the money we're having to put into the high school to handle massive leaks that happen or asbestos tiles that come off the floor, all of those remediation costs are going to continue to accelerate until we are able to really undertake this project.

241
00:24:41,135 --> 00:24:46,700
So we should be, in my opinion, trying to move as fast as possible, although the MSBA is going to

242
00:24:48,206 --> 00:24:50,369
We can't move faster than they're willing to let us move.

243
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:55,615
So we just need to try to be on the front of the timeline instead of on the back of it as much as possible.

244
00:24:56,476 --> 00:24:57,197
Thank you, Member Graham.

245
00:24:57,718 --> 00:24:58,379
Member Reinfeldt.

246
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,222
The question about community vote.

247
00:25:01,362 --> 00:25:03,345
Is that part of a regular election cycle?

248
00:25:03,385 --> 00:25:04,446
Is that a special election?

249
00:25:04,526 --> 00:25:06,489
What does that look like?

250
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:14,314
I hope you would, I'll turn to member Rousseau, but hopefully during a regular election, member Rousseau.

251
00:25:14,494 --> 00:25:19,137
Well, the mayor has already said hopefully, but there's no requirement that it happened during a regular election.

252
00:25:19,177 --> 00:25:20,418
It can be anytime.

253
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:30,365
And depending on a certain communities may strategically choose to not do it in a regular election or a general election, you know, depending on the makeup of the community.

254
00:25:30,425 --> 00:25:33,447
And, you know, if it's a presidential, you know, everybody's showing up,

255
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:35,485
Is that something you actually want?

256
00:25:37,145 --> 00:25:41,727
So there's no one answer, but obviously the city would have to pay for an election.

257
00:25:41,867 --> 00:25:43,988
So that's a consideration too.

258
00:25:45,568 --> 00:25:45,908
Thank you.

259
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,710
Thank you for the update, Dr. Edward Vincent.

260
00:25:53,191 --> 00:25:57,393
Last for reports, we have the report on the status of the school committee goals.

261
00:25:57,753 --> 00:25:59,614
So again, turn it over to you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

262
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:01,851
Good evening.

263
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:04,672
Back in October.

264
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:19,116
October 16 was the meeting where we had a lot of technical difficulties and we had to people couldn't hear audio there were all kinds of problems happening that day.

265
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,637
So we actually had the goals.

266
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:24,758
And if it's possible.

267
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:26,259
Thank you.

268
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:30,160
We'll get we'll get them up in a moment to for you to look at but

269
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:38,964
These goals were voted by you the committee approved on March 6 2023 of last year.

270
00:26:38,984 --> 00:26:39,124
And so.

271
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:52,350
It was March six that you during the 2223 school year.

272
00:26:53,391 --> 00:27:02,382
March six you put out seven key actions that you as a committee wanted to accomplish.

273
00:27:03,423 --> 00:27:10,229
And the hope was that by November of 23, that all of these goals would be accomplished.

274
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:25,441
And when we originally were reporting out, the committee at that point in time had already accomplished, fully completed six of the seven key actions.

275
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:39,928
And so I'll just run through them very quickly, but all school committee agendas would be translated in the major recognized languages of the district starting in September of 23.

276
00:27:41,228 --> 00:27:51,093
That was completed and starting on the September 18th, 2023 school committee agenda, it was available and translated for the community.

277
00:27:54,111 --> 00:28:05,534
I will say the second key action was for us to host additional town hall meetings and provide opportunities for community feedback.

278
00:28:06,294 --> 00:28:10,775
And so that one is the only goal that is still in process.

279
00:28:11,175 --> 00:28:19,197
And now where we have so much MSBA work that's going to be taking place, I'm sure that we'll be having plenty of opportunities

280
00:28:20,378 --> 00:28:24,462
to engage the community in other ways over the course of the school year.

281
00:28:25,363 --> 00:28:34,933
The third key action was expanding the arts, through increasing programmatic offerings for students.

282
00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:41,395
and for us to strongly consider the addition of a theater teacher.

283
00:28:41,415 --> 00:28:47,777
And that was completed, and we did add the additional staffing.

284
00:28:47,837 --> 00:28:55,118
We did offer Jump Start Camp to our students during the summer months.

285
00:28:55,318 --> 00:29:00,279
So that went well, and that was, again, during late August for two weeks.

286
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:03,600
It was offered for students in grades four through eight.

287
00:29:05,341 --> 00:29:22,694
The fourth key action was to create an action plan for Medford High School, and Miss Cabral did come and present to the committee on September 18 at a regular meeting, and she will be providing another update.

288
00:29:24,336 --> 00:29:25,376
Later in the school year.

289
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:31,982
For number five, creating an updated superintendents evaluation process.

290
00:29:32,482 --> 00:29:35,064
The school committee completed that in June of 2023.

291
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:46,380
Number six was replacing the finance director in creating an earlier budget process that to was completed.

292
00:29:47,641 --> 00:29:49,942
Our finance director is Mr. Gerald McHugh.

293
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:54,884
He was appointed by the committee at our August 14 2023 meeting, and for number seven.

294
00:29:58,406 --> 00:30:05,872
submitting the MSBA core program application, which we did and we were selected.

295
00:30:06,593 --> 00:30:09,996
And so that was also completed.

296
00:30:10,757 --> 00:30:24,808
So I just wanted to provide the committee with what their goals were from the 22, 23 school year, and just to officially give you an update on that.

297
00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:25,489
Thank you.

298
00:30:27,128 --> 00:30:28,288
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

299
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:29,109
Member McLaughlin.

300
00:30:30,349 --> 00:30:30,729
Thank you.

301
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,830
Thank you, Dr. Vincent, for putting these forward.

302
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:50,976
And just to be clear for the community, these are school committee goals that the school committee as a whole set for ourselves to be able to identify and for the community action items that would be tied to our mission that you have in your own goals around

303
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:54,024
equity and community and so on and so forth.

304
00:30:54,044 --> 00:30:59,529
So these were our accountability to the, these are partially our accountability to the community.

305
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:03,692
And so I just had a couple of comments slash questions.

306
00:31:03,953 --> 00:31:15,723
One was, so as of September 18th, 2023, number one, the school committee agendas are available with translations in the most predominant languages in our district, right?

307
00:31:16,223 --> 00:31:16,484
Yes.

308
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,986
And what would those be just for the community?

309
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:28,479
We have it in English, English of course, Spanish, Portuguese, Haitian Creole, and Arabic.

310
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:35,882
Those are the four languages that we have been translating all of our documents in those four languages.

311
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:42,545
And so the agenda, effective September 18th was when that started.

312
00:31:42,865 --> 00:31:45,926
Thank you, and so those are available on the website in those languages?

313
00:31:46,126 --> 00:31:46,426
Yes.

314
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,146
Okay, thank you.

315
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:52,520
Not that somebody has to translate with a button or Google or what have you.

316
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,841
They're separately translated.

317
00:31:55,301 --> 00:32:00,823
I don't know exactly the specific posting, but when it's posted, it has the language.

318
00:32:00,843 --> 00:32:03,664
It's similar to the Friday communication.

319
00:32:04,064 --> 00:32:04,464
It's there.

320
00:32:04,484 --> 00:32:05,785
It has the languages at the top.

321
00:32:05,805 --> 00:32:07,345
They just have to click on the language.

322
00:32:07,566 --> 00:32:08,306
Okay, thank you.

323
00:32:08,686 --> 00:32:09,286
May I, Mayor?

324
00:32:09,306 --> 00:32:09,846
I have a few more.

325
00:32:10,807 --> 00:32:11,147
Thank you.

326
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:19,235
For the town hall meetings, I think I know that that's the sort of one in process that we're talking about.

327
00:32:19,275 --> 00:32:21,817
So October was going to be the first town hall meeting.

328
00:32:22,377 --> 00:32:27,982
And now the remainder of the note there says that it suggested, you know, that hasn't happened, so it needs to be scheduled.

329
00:32:28,422 --> 00:32:29,543
We had said we would have three.

330
00:32:29,563 --> 00:32:36,468
And to be clear, the town hall meetings wouldn't, you know, include community hosted by, you know, admin.

331
00:32:36,828 --> 00:32:42,673
Obviously, I would assume school committee members would be going, but essentially that it's community feedback opportunity

332
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:49,002
on a number of items that don't have to be specific necessarily to the MSBA, but can be.

333
00:32:49,623 --> 00:32:51,947
And so the October one wasn't scheduled.

334
00:32:51,987 --> 00:32:54,891
And then it says the superintendent should desk at the remaining two meetings.

335
00:32:55,376 --> 00:32:56,877
take place in February and May.

336
00:32:57,317 --> 00:33:01,039
So we have three that we need to schedule, it sounds like, before the end of May.

337
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:02,180
Is that right?

338
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,241
Yes, if I may.

339
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:11,345
And it was only where the committee suggested three, or that was what was put forward.

340
00:33:11,385 --> 00:33:17,409
So I just tentatively was just thinking about having it spread out.

341
00:33:17,449 --> 00:33:19,410
But that's up to the committee to decide

342
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:22,071
It was just a suggestion.

343
00:33:22,091 --> 00:33:28,054
And again, this would have been presented in October, so it would have made more sense at that point in time.

344
00:33:28,614 --> 00:33:32,916
So that was the only one that was in process.

345
00:33:33,296 --> 00:33:33,657
Thank you.

346
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:36,018
So it looks like we are past you on that one.

347
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:42,041
And to be clear, I want to make sure that, again, the community understands that this is school committee goals, right?

348
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:45,002
That we're working as a school committee to be able to do these goals.

349
00:33:45,182 --> 00:33:46,823
These are not necessarily things that we're asking.

350
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:56,262
or dumping on administration to be able to do, we should be working collaboratively to make sure that these things are happening, because these are things that we said we would be responsible for as well.

351
00:33:56,962 --> 00:34:06,929
So then I would just ask for the number four, create an action plan for Medford High School for the 2023-24 school year prior to October 1.

352
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:13,753
I know the action plan was completed, and we talked about Principal Cabral coming to present

353
00:34:14,673 --> 00:34:15,453
to us again.

354
00:34:15,473 --> 00:34:23,737
And one of the things that was discussed was the Welsh report for the recommendations for the high school.

355
00:34:24,017 --> 00:34:27,519
And I know that that had been said we would do that a little bit later in the year.

356
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:32,321
And I'm just sort of circling back on that because I feel like it was already end of year last year.

357
00:34:32,341 --> 00:34:35,302
I believe that Mr. Welsh was making the recommendations for the high school.

358
00:34:35,762 --> 00:34:41,925
And if we're waiting again till the end of this year to find out whether those recommendations are being implemented or not,

359
00:34:42,421 --> 00:34:49,834
It just feels late and it doesn't really feel like we met the goal that we said we would meet for hiring the consultant to make recommendations to.

360
00:34:50,407 --> 00:34:53,448
demonstrate that the recommendations were not being implemented.

361
00:34:53,588 --> 00:34:56,748
So I'd like to sort of put that out to my colleagues.

362
00:34:56,908 --> 00:34:59,069
Yeah, and if I may, we did have Ms.

363
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:06,850
Cabral back in December when she gave updates and highlights on the high school during the high school presentation.

364
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:18,773
So again, when these goals were written and trying to just fill in the table with where we were at that point in time, it was October.

365
00:35:19,293 --> 00:35:25,657
And then since then, as a committee, we had the committee of the whole, where the committee approved.

366
00:35:26,198 --> 00:35:35,444
When Miss Cabral would be coming back because there's still a lot of things happening I mean, even this week they're, they're having the el desi is there.

367
00:35:35,764 --> 00:35:36,605
So there are a lot of.

368
00:35:38,726 --> 00:35:42,648
just a lot of housekeeping things that are taking place right now at the high school.

369
00:35:43,249 --> 00:35:51,914
So I wanna be able to give her that time to be able to come do a substantial presentation and another update.

370
00:35:51,994 --> 00:35:56,856
But in October, she hadn't yet provided the December update.

371
00:35:57,437 --> 00:36:01,999
So there is more information about the high school that has been shared with the community.

372
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,480
Yeah, thank you.

373
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,201
And may I, Mayor?

374
00:36:05,066 --> 00:36:16,594
just to the, thank you, just to that point, sort of, you know, the Welsh report is, you know, again, something that was very much moved forward by the committee and, you know, paid for, you know, through our school funds for the committee.

375
00:36:17,154 --> 00:36:22,477
And, you know, there were recommendations that were made there that were presented to us and sort of getting an update on those is really important.

376
00:36:22,497 --> 00:36:33,865
So I understand that we made a calendar for the remainder of the year agenda items for the remainder of the year that we discussed, that would be really helpful to put out, but to be really explicit and clear that in that presentation,

377
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:39,772
we'll be revisiting the recommendations from the consultant that was here, and that we'll be going through those.

378
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:40,752
Absolutely, absolutely.

379
00:36:40,772 --> 00:36:42,493
Thank you, that would be really helpful.

380
00:36:46,795 --> 00:36:53,258
Yeah, and I guess toward that end, I mean, I think it's of the one, two, three, what was it, seven?

381
00:36:53,418 --> 00:36:53,798
Seven.

382
00:36:54,098 --> 00:36:59,301
Yeah, of the seven, we partially completed the goals.

383
00:36:59,341 --> 00:37:01,862
It looks like one remaining and maybe a question of another.

384
00:37:02,892 --> 00:37:06,694
remaining, but I think to that end, you know, that's good news.

385
00:37:06,754 --> 00:37:08,095
Thank you for the presentation.

386
00:37:08,655 --> 00:37:30,125
And I think I would also ask my colleagues to consider goals for the next term and, you know, whether it's the good of the order for next month or what have you, but we're thinking about what goals our school committee wants to achieve collectively as a team to be working together so that we're tied again to the strategic plan, but more

387
00:37:30,598 --> 00:37:32,840
about the accountability to the community.

388
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,062
And I believe there was something about website update in our goals.

389
00:37:36,202 --> 00:37:36,983
Am I missing that?

390
00:37:37,203 --> 00:37:38,344
Wasn't there something about that?

391
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:47,231
When I created this, when I went back to the meeting and those were the seven that were set at that point in time on that particular day.

392
00:37:47,271 --> 00:37:53,856
So I did not capture anything about the website at that particular meeting.

393
00:37:54,456 --> 00:37:55,057
I'll go back and look.

394
00:37:55,077 --> 00:37:57,699
I know we had a couple of meetings about that, but I just wanted to sort of look.

395
00:37:57,759 --> 00:37:58,840
So thank you.

396
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,301
Thank you for indulging me.

397
00:38:00,947 --> 00:38:05,251
Thank you, Member McLaughlin, and thank you for presenting the goals of the school committee.

398
00:38:05,692 --> 00:38:06,232
Member Graham?

399
00:38:07,233 --> 00:38:14,780
Do you have any information about how frequently the translated agendas are being accessed?

400
00:38:15,701 --> 00:38:19,025
Can we see the click rate or anything on those documents?

401
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:24,190
Mr. Dalton.

402
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,332
I'm happy to check.

403
00:38:29,332 --> 00:38:37,938
I think we'll be able to tell with the likes of the the Google translations of the superintendent's weekly memos.

404
00:38:38,038 --> 00:38:41,840
I'm not certain about the agendas because of the way they're uploaded to the website.

405
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:44,081
But I can take a look at the back end.

406
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:49,985
Yeah, I would just be interested to know sort of what what kind of access we're promoting

407
00:38:50,165 --> 00:39:00,213
Yeah, and if I may, I would also mention that when it comes to agendas for the school committee, we've also started posting it in two formats.

408
00:39:00,313 --> 00:39:03,796
So previously, we had only posted a link to the PDF.

409
00:39:05,057 --> 00:39:12,643
The PDFs include the translation links for the four major languages, but they're hard for other translation tools to process.

410
00:39:14,304 --> 00:39:19,328
Now we're also posting them into the HTML body of the webpage.

411
00:39:20,209 --> 00:39:27,075
That should make it easier for those using translation tools built into their own browsers.

412
00:39:27,935 --> 00:39:39,305
If someone was looking to translate into, you know, Mandarin or Swahili or another language that we don't do the translations for, it should be more accessible on a language front.

413
00:39:39,345 --> 00:39:43,108
So that's another improved move made with the agenda posting.

414
00:39:43,865 --> 00:39:44,145
Thank you.

415
00:39:45,186 --> 00:39:45,526
Thank you.

416
00:39:47,227 --> 00:39:54,471
We do not have any presentations of the public or continued business or new business, but we do have several motions.

417
00:39:54,812 --> 00:40:09,020
First up, 2024-4 offered by member Graham, be resolved that the Medford School Committee discuss the formation of the Medford High School Building Committee and identify key priorities and attributes for the committee on February 5th, 2024.

418
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:19,662
The goal of the discussion will be to inform the creation of a resolution and application process that will be drafted for review at an upcoming committee of the whole member Graham.

419
00:40:20,123 --> 00:40:20,463
Thank you.

420
00:40:21,644 --> 00:40:24,105
So I think procedurally we need to.

421
00:40:26,277 --> 00:40:32,042
vote this resolution favorably and then open the floor for the actual discussion.

422
00:40:32,123 --> 00:40:41,351
So my goal with this is for us to really start to talk about things that are collectively important to us as we think about forming the committee.

423
00:40:42,512 --> 00:40:46,836
MSBA is really explicit that local control is

424
00:40:48,123 --> 00:40:52,145
the answer for all questions about the school building committee.

425
00:40:53,266 --> 00:40:57,668
And they actually sort of decline even to say what you could do or what you should do.

426
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:01,810
They really want communities to think through that for themselves.

427
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:16,777
And sort of the consequence of that is if you look at other building committees, some are very small, some are very big, but I'm hoping that first we can pass this and then we can have some discussion if people have things on their mind

428
00:41:17,512 --> 00:41:32,162
I would love to know that I sort of started drafting a resolution that would allow us to say this is how we're going to proceed forward, but it's very basic right now and I think some of this discussion would help inform that so that we can then review.

429
00:41:32,862 --> 00:41:37,363
something completely and and sort of get that process off to the races.

430
00:41:37,504 --> 00:41:57,690
I would like to see us be able to have that meeting by the end of February so that by the end of March, we have picked our committee and we're sort of a little bit ahead of the eligibility process timeline so that the group can start to meet and they can start to like norm and they can start to learn about their requirements under the open meeting law, etcetera.

431
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,311
So, anyway, I motion to approve.

432
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,271
A question.

433
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:05,235
Member McLaughlin and Member Reinfeld.

434
00:42:06,475 --> 00:42:06,915
Thank you.

435
00:42:08,336 --> 00:42:08,616
So.

436
00:42:10,397 --> 00:42:10,797
For the.

437
00:42:11,937 --> 00:42:14,378
It sounds like the motion is to.

438
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:23,722
Have a motion that will discuss the formation of the Medford High School and identify priorities and attributes.

439
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,304
By the end of February, is that what you're suggesting?

440
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:33,293
No, if we pass the motion, we'll talk about that tonight.

441
00:42:33,633 --> 00:42:33,913
Okay.

442
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:37,914
And then, okay, that's why, okay.

443
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,896
I was gonna motion to approve, but I'll second, that's why.

444
00:42:42,336 --> 00:42:43,417
That's why I put my mic on.

445
00:42:45,457 --> 00:42:45,817
Oh, sorry.

446
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:46,138
Motion.

447
00:42:46,158 --> 00:42:47,138
Are you not done, Member McLaughlin?

448
00:42:47,718 --> 00:42:54,061
I think it's just a little hard to understand why the February 5th date's in there, but so I'm with you.

449
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:57,202
Do you have any other comments, Member McLaughlin, before?

450
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,050
move the motion?

451
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,911
No, if the motion is just to open discussion, I didn't know that.

452
00:43:02,071 --> 00:43:03,091
Yeah, that's fine.

453
00:43:03,131 --> 00:43:06,813
I thought I'm a little confused on why we have to have a motion to open discussion.

454
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:09,393
I thought it would just be an agenda item to open discussion.

455
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:12,074
I'm not sure why we are motioning to open a discussion.

456
00:43:12,114 --> 00:43:14,375
I guess I just love some clarification.

457
00:43:15,955 --> 00:43:18,496
Everything I put on the agenda goes through a resolution.

458
00:43:18,576 --> 00:43:19,616
So that's what I did.

459
00:43:20,657 --> 00:43:21,257
Just that simple.

460
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:28,386
Motion to open discussion by Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeld.

461
00:43:28,446 --> 00:43:29,107
All those in favor?

462
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:29,687
Aye.

463
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:30,727
All those opposed?

464
00:43:32,428 --> 00:43:33,248
Motion is approved.

465
00:43:34,008 --> 00:43:35,389
Who would like to start discussion?

466
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:37,490
Member McLaughlin.

467
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:37,930
Thank you.

468
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:48,594
I would love to know sort of just in terms of thought around what the requirements are for the building committee from the

469
00:43:50,675 --> 00:44:10,450
MSB, if there are requirements that we get copies of what the requirements are for what it looked like, and I'm assuming obviously that one of the requirements is that it will be representative obviously of the community that is in our school and that there'll be opportunities for interpretation, translation, access, all of those things.

470
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:18,816
So the question is, is there a guideline on what the committee should be comprised of from

471
00:44:19,654 --> 00:44:22,258
MSBA, and if so, can we get a copy of that?

472
00:44:23,259 --> 00:44:23,499
Mayor?

473
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:25,722
Member Graham.

474
00:44:25,842 --> 00:44:28,005
There is a set of guidelines.

475
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,427
I'm going to text you.

476
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:36,516
It's all on their website, so every last bit of information is on their website.

477
00:44:37,153 --> 00:44:39,937
just texted you that I just texted you the link member McLaughlin.

478
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,500
They do have requirements.

479
00:44:43,101 --> 00:44:54,737
So for example, they require that somebody on the committee is certified procurement officer, they require that the local chief executive officer, which would be the mayor is on the committee.

480
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:58,733
They require that one school committee member is on a minimum of one.

481
00:44:59,973 --> 00:45:07,439
The superintendent of schools, the local official responsible for building maintenance is on the school principal is on.

482
00:45:09,919 --> 00:45:30,324
and a member knowledgeable about the educational mission and function of the facility is on the committee, a local budget official, which would be probably our CFO, and then members of the community who have architecture, engineering, and or construction experience.

483
00:45:31,004 --> 00:45:31,964
That's the requirement.

484
00:45:32,064 --> 00:45:33,944
There is no requirement to be inclusive.

485
00:45:34,004 --> 00:45:36,485
There is no requirement to provide translation.

486
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:40,051
all of that is, is subject to local control.

487
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:43,151
Um, there's no requirement to how big the committee is.

488
00:45:43,451 --> 00:45:52,793
Um, the requirement is that we notify them of who is on the committee, um, and that we identify who's a voting member and that we notify them if things change.

489
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:56,554
So, and I think that's really typical in a project that lasts five to seven years.

490
00:45:56,594 --> 00:46:05,456
So I don't think it's necessarily unusual that a committee would sort of change over time, um, through the phases and that kind of thing.

491
00:46:05,516 --> 00:46:05,656
So

492
00:46:06,121 --> 00:46:22,919
The requirements are really about sort of the, I would say like the bare minimum to actually make the project happen, but it doesn't go further than that to describe anything more than that.

493
00:46:24,841 --> 00:46:25,722
Thank you, Member Graham.

494
00:46:25,742 --> 00:46:26,442
Member McLaughlin?

495
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:28,805
Whoops, thank you.

496
00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:32,170
So if I'm understanding, thank you for sending the link.

497
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:36,131
And I, you know, if you wouldn't mind sending it to the committee as a whole, that would be great.

498
00:46:36,831 --> 00:46:38,972
And save people may be searching a little bit.

499
00:46:39,032 --> 00:46:39,452
Thank you.

500
00:46:40,412 --> 00:46:51,056
And then if I'm understanding correctly, it sounds like those are minimum requirements that we must meet in order for the committee, but certainly not the totality of the requirements.

501
00:46:51,096 --> 00:46:58,998
And I guess I'm just asking the committee to consider, you know, some of us know the history of what was

502
00:46:59,774 --> 00:47:11,298
once a high school committee that was created and initially created under a different administration, I believe, and then changed or recreated under another administration.

503
00:47:11,438 --> 00:47:20,741
And it caused a lot of community grief around the way that process was or wasn't moved forward.

504
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:25,182
And I just want to make sure that we're really understanding that as a committee.

505
00:47:25,626 --> 00:47:39,632
before we start to do this and understanding what the history was and understanding, you know, prior applicants and, you know, people who were, you know, and then how it just sort of dropped off with everything else that needed to be taken care of.

506
00:47:40,072 --> 00:47:46,455
That committee just sort of vanished and nothing more came of it.

507
00:47:46,615 --> 00:47:52,417
And so I think we asked people to apply, we asked for a process, we asked for a whole

508
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:53,765
slew of things.

509
00:47:53,905 --> 00:47:58,468
And then that was done and then people were appointed and, and then, and then nothing really came of it.

510
00:47:59,008 --> 00:48:08,395
And so I think part of it is like building trust with the community again, but I also think it's, which is part of what the town halls were intended for, um, and building relationships.

511
00:48:08,835 --> 00:48:21,364
And I think it's really important that we're thoughtful as a, as a committee about how we're moving forward with us to make sure we are really not creating some of the same missteps that we did in the past.

512
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:25,334
Member Rousseau.

513
00:48:25,834 --> 00:48:26,234
Thank you.

514
00:48:28,176 --> 00:48:38,065
I've looked at some building committees around and one of the things that was sort of glaring to me as confusing was that there was, there were no parents.

515
00:48:39,467 --> 00:48:40,808
There might be one teacher.

516
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:47,754
And I was trying to wrap my head around it because I remember Graham and I did talk about like, you know, just

517
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:50,947
blue sky about like, who would we want?

518
00:48:51,507 --> 00:48:57,553
And we were quickly at like 30 people, or I don't know, I think it was a huge number of people.

519
00:48:59,335 --> 00:49:12,827
And so managing a group of that size is certainly a challenge, but even if that wasn't a challenge, we have to also acknowledge that what we're asking for in the commitment to be on this committee

520
00:49:14,176 --> 00:49:17,637
is as much work as it is to be a school committee member, probably more.

521
00:49:17,657 --> 00:49:23,238
I mean, it's many hours a week of uncompensated labor and it's an open meeting.

522
00:49:23,458 --> 00:49:29,939
If a quorum doesn't show up, we don't keep moving along in our process to getting a new high school until that quorum can show up.

523
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:37,821
So the commitment that we're asking whoever does end up being on this, it's not a garden club.

524
00:49:38,201 --> 00:49:41,282
We're asking for a shocking amount of unpaid labor

525
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:48,654
and a commitment, and as Member Graham pointed out, like the committee will probably change over the course of five to seven years.

526
00:49:49,115 --> 00:50:06,018
So that's normal and not surprising, but we will have to be very careful that we, you know, if we decided we wanted to have several students and they're voting members, but if they don't show up and then suddenly there's not a quorum, whatever the agenda was, it's not happening.

527
00:50:06,518 --> 00:50:07,859
So I, you know, it's,

528
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:19,827
I have a strong desire to have inclusion of a whole host of different members of the community and different kinds of levels in the high school.

529
00:50:20,227 --> 00:50:22,328
I do want all of those people involved.

530
00:50:22,709 --> 00:50:32,735
On the other hand, when I look around at other school committees, Winchester, Arlington, Somerville, they have 12 people.

531
00:50:34,329 --> 00:50:36,570
And that includes all these mandatory people.

532
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:48,433
So, you know, I spoke to someone who is on the Somerville school committee today about this and I said, what are the big mistakes, what should we not what what do we really need to make sure we don't screw up.

533
00:50:49,173 --> 00:50:51,714
And it was, it was interesting because she talked about.

534
00:50:52,254 --> 00:50:56,938
you know, you need to have, you should have a student, you know, inclusion of all these different groups.

535
00:50:57,259 --> 00:51:01,903
And then after I got off the phone with her, I went and looked at their website and they actually weren't there.

536
00:51:02,183 --> 00:51:04,645
So I'm still trying to parse how that worked out.

537
00:51:05,466 --> 00:51:14,794
I do know that in this process, while MSBA's requirements on who has to be on the committee is a pretty short list, there's mandatory

538
00:51:16,096 --> 00:51:23,128
community outreach, there's, I think there's surveys I think there's listening sessions there's focus groups with the community.

539
00:51:23,569 --> 00:51:28,677
So, it's even if we don't end up with a community committee, a building committee that is.

540
00:51:29,685 --> 00:51:34,209
as large as we want it to be from the perspective of including all the right voices.

541
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:37,251
That's not to suggest that that's the end of it.

542
00:51:37,852 --> 00:51:42,775
The building committee will not go off in a room by themselves and just do the project.

543
00:51:44,357 --> 00:51:49,701
There's mandatory stuff that will pull in other members of the community.

544
00:51:49,761 --> 00:51:51,783
And one of the other suggestions she had, which

545
00:51:53,058 --> 00:52:05,403
I haven't processed because there's only a couple hours ago, was the idea of an advisory committee to the building committee so we can create advisory committees left and right we've created one, a couple of them in the past.

546
00:52:06,463 --> 00:52:08,384
And so I mean I haven't thought about how that might work.

547
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:26,172
having shorter term and more focused specific groups that we could create to advise the building committee, not unlike a subcommittee, but the subcommittees of the building committee will be full members of the committee.

548
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:29,795
So again, if we had 12, you can't have 15 subcommittees.

549
00:52:32,403 --> 00:52:34,084
we have an awful lot to figure out here.

550
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:50,211
And I was at the conference in November with member Graham and there's a big aversion as member McLaughlin, sorry, but I don't think you were in this session with us, sorry.

551
00:52:50,772 --> 00:52:55,134
And there was definitely an aversion to trying to provide advice on this.

552
00:52:55,754 --> 00:52:56,535
particular thing.

553
00:52:56,555 --> 00:53:05,065
And if you think about it, like there are regional districts where people are hour and a half away from the school, like providing a this is how you do it.

554
00:53:06,006 --> 00:53:14,755
When people are dispersed over a quarter of the state and some of these regional districts that would be really inappropriate and then there's communities that are so tiny that

555
00:53:15,516 --> 00:53:18,078
Again, that same advice would be weird.

556
00:53:18,439 --> 00:53:27,567
On the other hand, I really wish we would get some more advice on this because being wide open feels very, well, it feels a little risky.

557
00:53:28,187 --> 00:53:33,092
If we build this too big and then it just can't function, time is ticking.

558
00:53:33,532 --> 00:53:35,053
So that's my concerns.

559
00:53:37,916 --> 00:53:38,837
Thank you, Member Rousseau.

560
00:53:39,657 --> 00:53:40,438
Member Olopade.

561
00:53:40,919 --> 00:53:49,823
Yes, thank you so something that memory so mentioned I think is important, or something that I would consider the productive suggestion maybe is that we both have.

562
00:53:50,273 --> 00:53:55,414
I think this advisory committee suggestion, but also having voting members and then inclusion members.

563
00:53:55,474 --> 00:54:08,818
So I think because we want this to be an expedient process, not because we want to ignore communities in the community, ignore communities in the city, but we want to make sure that we're going at the speed that we should be going at so that this process completes in a timely fashion.

564
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:14,820
Is it possible that we do have our building committee that are voting members, and then we also have our advisory groups?

565
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:42,155
who are giving us suggestions on certain aspects of the construction or the remodeling, just because I think that, I think member Russo is correct that if we want, we want to include as we do parents and students and other members, other stakeholders in the city, if they're not able to attend for a variety of reasons, as we all understand that we're living in the world, it's possible that they can include their voices when applicable, but they're not stalling the voting processes of the building, if that makes sense.

566
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:42,855
Just a thought.

567
00:54:43,055 --> 00:54:43,215
Yes.

568
00:54:44,116 --> 00:54:44,476
Great idea.

569
00:54:45,044 --> 00:54:45,746
Member Graham.

570
00:54:47,609 --> 00:54:49,713
I've been sort of thinking about this.

571
00:54:50,194 --> 00:54:55,645
I know somebody who's on a building committee in another community and she said there's like 35 people on the committee, and it's

572
00:54:56,428 --> 00:55:01,372
That sounds like horribly unwieldy in terms of actually moving the committee through.

573
00:55:01,392 --> 00:55:05,195
And so I've been thinking a lot about this.

574
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:19,487
And one, I think one variable is to explore and maybe ask a couple of questions, which I can do of the MSBA about the requirements around non-voting members of the committee, because they can be, you can appoint people to the committee who are non-voting members.

575
00:55:20,287 --> 00:55:32,158
Um, but I, but I also think, um, maybe there's a process for us that says the committee is going to be a certain size through, um, the onboarding of the owner's project manager.

576
00:55:32,718 --> 00:55:35,240
And what that really means is through the eligibility phase.

577
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:42,466
So that is like those, those distinct deliverables, the chapter 74 profile, the educational profile and the maintenance plan.

578
00:55:43,027 --> 00:55:46,550
So maybe there is a possibility for us to think about.

579
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:52,977
having a committee be maybe smaller for that first phase so that we can move through it.

580
00:55:53,557 --> 00:56:04,109
And then once the owner's project manager is onboarded, they'll help advise about sort of the broader array of community input that has to and should happen from there on out.

581
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:11,512
But I also think quickly, as soon as you hire the owner's project manager, you're in the next phase, which is the feasibility study.

582
00:56:12,032 --> 00:56:22,855
And that's where I think the committee actually has to expand and get a little bit bigger, because that's the point at which we're going to consider things like, are we going to try to renovate this?

583
00:56:23,175 --> 00:56:25,296
Is one option to renovate this building in place?

584
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:29,737
And that causes disruption, and you have to have mitigation plans for that disruption.

585
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:33,040
Or is the plan we're going to put it right on the side of it?

586
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:36,182
Or is the plan we're going to put it somewhere in the sky?

587
00:56:36,202 --> 00:56:36,682
Or whatever it is.

588
00:56:36,702 --> 00:56:38,444
We're going to put it in the air rights over Wellington.

589
00:56:38,504 --> 00:56:45,329
Whatever those options are, that's to me where the real community conversation starts to happen.

590
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:46,571
And that's where the energy comes.

591
00:56:46,631 --> 00:56:49,713
Because people are already talking about, are we going to put it here?

592
00:56:49,733 --> 00:56:50,454
Are we going to put it there?

593
00:56:50,514 --> 00:56:53,156
So I think this upfront phase is sort of our

594
00:56:53,874 --> 00:56:59,118
requirement to do a lot of blocking and tackling and to fulfill our requirements so that we can get there.

595
00:56:59,638 --> 00:57:02,720
But once we get there, that's where the community input comes in.

596
00:57:04,281 --> 00:57:19,772
And so I was trying to think through, is there a two-step process to our building committee where that first group is committed through the start of the feasibility phase and can be re-upped if they want to and it's all working fine?

597
00:57:20,202 --> 00:57:23,063
but also some commitment to expansion when we get there.

598
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:33,907
Because I do think the value of having a bigger committee is the folks in that feasibility study are gonna be uniquely suited to go out and sell whatever the choice is to the rest of the community.

599
00:57:33,927 --> 00:57:37,168
And we will have to do that in a significant way.

600
00:57:37,228 --> 00:57:41,690
So we will, once we pick, they'll give us three options and we'll say we like option two.

601
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:46,412
And then we will have to fund that in some fashion, right?

602
00:57:46,452 --> 00:57:48,873
So whatever the reimbursement rate is from MSBA,

603
00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:50,570
we'll have to fund the rest of it.

604
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:58,176
And so then we will need to mobilize lots and lots and lots of people to turn out a vote that's gonna vote favorably, right?

605
00:57:58,276 --> 00:58:06,021
So, and if you've been watching the news, a vote just failed north of here at Whittier Tech.

606
00:58:06,922 --> 00:58:13,267
And MSBA, I just saw an article today that MSBA came back to them and said, you've got X days to get this right, or you're out.

607
00:58:13,727 --> 00:58:17,570
So they are literally at funding and they can't pass a vote.

608
00:58:18,274 --> 00:58:22,018
We can't take that risk because we have no fallback plan.

609
00:58:22,038 --> 00:58:24,099
This building needs this work.

610
00:58:25,321 --> 00:58:42,977
So maybe once we get through this first phase in terms of go fast, expanding the committee so that there's a broader cross-section of community members who are supportive and stated are willing to work to support whatever sort of funding is required.

611
00:58:45,393 --> 00:58:52,635
to sort of bring more people into the fold in that phase, which is, I think, the phase that everyone eagerly wants to get to, right?

612
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,476
Like this whole, like, how many classrooms do you have?

613
00:58:56,856 --> 00:58:59,137
It's very important, and we have to do all of those things.

614
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:05,479
But I've not heard a single member of the community say, I'm really looking forward to counting classrooms at Medford High, right?

615
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:11,341
Like, what they're really interested in is, will it be in place, and will it be in the field, and will it be in the parking lot, et cetera, et cetera.

616
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:13,500
I was sort of trying to think through that.

617
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:19,986
I'm not even like sold on it myself, but I think it's a possibility in terms of like how we go through this.

618
00:59:20,906 --> 00:59:29,474
But I also, the other thing I was thinking about is like, is there a shorter term commitment that we're asking people to sign up for upfront?

619
00:59:29,654 --> 00:59:35,439
Because asking somebody to commit to five to seven years is a very big commitment.

620
00:59:36,267 --> 00:59:41,809
So, so how do we sort of strike that balance and in when we put this all together.

621
00:59:42,770 --> 01:00:02,178
Just be really clear with people about what this looks like like you will need to meet in person and the meetings will be on, you know, we will have this many meetings and like as best we can to inform people of what the requirements are so that we don't have quorum issues and we can actually proceed with sort of our collective intention to move as quickly as possible.

622
01:00:02,751 --> 01:00:11,561
So that's some of the stuff I've been trying to think through is like is it a two phase process and do we just sort of design it that way from the beginning so that.

623
01:00:13,257 --> 01:00:33,159
we can both move fast into the phase that is actually like exciting and like people are eagerly waiting for but also let people know that just because they're not involved in this first phase doesn't mean a we're not interested in their input because there's plenty of opportunity for that but also be that there's still an opportunity when we get to the exciting stuff and then there's probably a whole other group of people who are like

624
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:40,985
I want to pick the color of the chairs that is going to go in the new Medford High School and I'm the one that wants to make sure the left-handed desks are there, whatever it is, right?

625
01:00:41,386 --> 01:00:53,236
And so there's probably even like phases beyond feasibility that we could think about, but you know, at least up front, there seems like maybe there's a line there that we should explore.

626
01:00:55,598 --> 01:00:56,278
Thank you, Member Graham.

627
01:00:56,418 --> 01:00:59,461
Member Reinfeld, Member McLaughlin, Member Russo.

628
01:01:01,053 --> 01:01:04,976
I am curious what expertise we already have here.

629
01:01:05,176 --> 01:01:17,146
Like I pretty sure we don't have people in the district who have been through a new construction process and that feels for new construction in a school.

630
01:01:17,487 --> 01:01:21,410
So I'm curious what the expertise is and where our gaps are.

631
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:24,512
And then the other thing that I wanted to say is I think

632
01:01:25,811 --> 01:01:30,933
Defining the committee, I like the idea of starting with what we need and being really clear about the process.

633
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:40,838
So I think putting that in addition to the committee, just the process of here are some key milestones for that community input at these stages is really going to be essential.

634
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,819
And these are the points when we will evaluate.

635
01:01:42,839 --> 01:01:44,700
Is the committee shifting?

636
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:46,541
Are we rotating?

637
01:01:47,702 --> 01:01:52,304
this position or that position, but I would like to know what expertise we currently have.

638
01:01:53,104 --> 01:01:54,645
The requirements say one principal.

639
01:01:54,805 --> 01:02:01,227
I feel like if we're talking about the Medford High School vocational combination, we actually need two principals there.

640
01:02:01,408 --> 01:02:03,548
So that kind of conversation.

641
01:02:03,588 --> 01:02:06,089
How big is our committee of people that we already have?

642
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:10,311
Thank you, member McLaughlin.

643
01:02:11,932 --> 01:02:13,312
Will you yield to member Graham?

644
01:02:16,133 --> 01:02:17,274
Member Graham, just to answer that.

645
01:02:17,719 --> 01:02:29,301
Yeah, I think there's probably like 10 to 15 people in the district that you would want on this committee to cover those bases.

646
01:02:29,341 --> 01:02:32,762
That was like what I'm remembering when I was like making a mental list.

647
01:02:32,822 --> 01:02:43,444
It's somewhere in that neighborhood of just school administrators, teachers, et cetera, that you would want in the mix before, even before you start talking about members of the community.

648
01:02:43,803 --> 01:02:46,366
just to get the educational piece of it, right?

649
01:02:46,506 --> 01:02:49,609
And then what are the gaps there that we would need for the core committee?

650
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:50,730
What needs to be filled in?

651
01:02:52,652 --> 01:02:54,014
Member McLaughlin and Member Russo?

652
01:02:55,015 --> 01:02:55,435
Thank you.

653
01:02:55,635 --> 01:03:03,543
So I think while this is all very exciting, and it is very exciting, and I know that we have our first deadline in 270 days, which obviously can

654
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,360
I think we need to go by really quickly.

655
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:13,002
I also feel like, you know, there needs to be a PR campaign around this.

656
01:03:13,062 --> 01:03:20,003
I feel like, you know, the superintendent's memos, which have been helpful, what have you, are not always read by the entire community.

657
01:03:20,083 --> 01:03:24,604
There's not, you know, there's a large constituency I'm sure we're missing.

658
01:03:25,184 --> 01:03:28,645
And I think we also need just like a one-on-one, like what is this?

659
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:31,265
How, you know, certainly this has been super helpful.

660
01:03:33,956 --> 01:03:35,377
visual, I think that's really helpful.

661
01:03:35,657 --> 01:03:39,841
And I'm thinking about even sort of even more elementary around like the 101.

662
01:03:39,921 --> 01:03:40,522
What is this?

663
01:03:40,882 --> 01:03:41,743
What is the potential?

664
01:03:42,083 --> 01:03:43,344
We've been invited to participate.

665
01:03:43,364 --> 01:03:44,005
What does that mean?

666
01:03:44,345 --> 01:03:46,407
How much can we actually get from this?

667
01:03:46,487 --> 01:03:48,809
What are the outcomes that could potentially happen?

668
01:03:48,849 --> 01:03:56,395
Like, I'm curious, I don't even know the answer to this, because I haven't been on the website, but like, what kind of money are we talking about potentially getting from this?

669
01:03:56,535 --> 01:03:58,497
And then, you know, it does that cover

670
01:03:58,936 --> 01:04:08,899
you know, X, Y, and Z for the entirety of the high school, which I'm sure we know that it doesn't, but we do have nearby communities that have gone through this process, right?

671
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,579
So Somerville's gone through it, I think, right?

672
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,140
Arlington's gone through it.

673
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,080
Did you say Winchester?

674
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,201
Remember, we were saying Winchester's gone through it.

675
01:04:16,221 --> 01:04:25,363
So we have these surrounding communities that have all gone through it, and actually I was driving by Arlington and Somerville in the past week, week and a half, and I was thinking it would be a really,

676
01:04:25,922 --> 01:04:35,069
great opportunity for the committee as a whole to be able to potentially get a tour of those facilities, but also to potentially talk to the folks that have gone through this process.

677
01:04:35,089 --> 01:04:45,816
So I think it's wonderful that member Rousseau was able to speak with his friend at the Somerville school committee, but I think for the benefit of the committee as a whole, we have three surrounding communities that have done this.

678
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:52,221
Why are we not tapping into that expertise as well in terms of being able to understand that better and then

679
01:04:52,751 --> 01:04:56,733
Again, I really do feel like there needs to be a whole PR campaign around this.

680
01:04:56,793 --> 01:05:02,976
I think we're throwing around words and terms and, you know, in phases of the development or whatever.

681
01:05:03,076 --> 01:05:05,738
And I don't think people even necessarily know what this means.

682
01:05:05,758 --> 01:05:14,022
Like, okay, we're talking about, you know, hopefully in our lifetime, I'm sure it will be building a new high school in Medford, right?

683
01:05:14,082 --> 01:05:16,363
Like basic one-on-one, what does that mean?

684
01:05:16,723 --> 01:05:18,304
You know, how are we gonna do that?

685
01:05:18,868 --> 01:05:23,151
you know, what can we get for, you know, this particular process, how else will we need to augment it?

686
01:05:23,171 --> 01:05:28,336
Like, I think we need a basic one-on-one, and I think we should be taking advantage of our neighbor's expertise.

687
01:05:29,657 --> 01:05:29,957
Thank you.

688
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:30,758
Member Rousseau.

689
01:05:31,498 --> 01:05:31,918
Thank you.

690
01:05:31,939 --> 01:05:38,043
I certainly have been trying to take advantage of our neighbor's expertise, but I understand the point.

691
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:40,926
I just think that it's hard enough to get us together.

692
01:05:40,986 --> 01:05:44,649
I think trying to get other school committees to serve us

693
01:05:46,539 --> 01:05:50,262
sounds like a challenging ask.

694
01:05:51,623 --> 01:05:52,543
It would be fabulous.

695
01:05:53,004 --> 01:05:56,826
I think it would be better if the MSBA actually provided this.

696
01:05:57,026 --> 01:06:07,234
Literally every single district going through this process is sitting here probably having the exact same conversation, like, why can't somebody give us a little help with how this is supposed to work?

697
01:06:09,676 --> 01:06:14,219
And I don't, I've never, obviously I've not been the fly on the wall as to why they don't go there.

698
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:16,221
It seems like a great place to go.

699
01:06:17,062 --> 01:06:32,233
There was a session in December I went to where all of the invited districts were, members were invited and there were like 400 and something people on the call.

700
01:06:33,354 --> 01:06:34,735
And it was fascinating.

701
01:06:34,775 --> 01:06:38,958
Everybody had the same questions and they were mostly around things like this.

702
01:06:40,006 --> 01:06:48,373
So, no, I actually, I don't remember, I don't know which towns they were, but it was just, it was very interesting.

703
01:06:48,613 --> 01:06:56,800
I did want to just reiterate, just kind of come back to something that Member Graham said that I actually think is important about this when we think about how to form the building committee.

704
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:06,828
And aside from, you know, the exciting stuff happens in feasibility and it's correct, nobody has asked to be on anything so they can count classrooms.

705
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:17,952
A lot of the things in the eligibility phase are in fact things that the building committee cannot actually help with, like they, you know, the members of the community who will end up on the building committee.

706
01:07:18,424 --> 01:07:22,106
will not even in feasibility be allowed to just roam the school.

707
01:07:23,647 --> 01:07:31,170
And a lot of these activities, there's a massive checklist of things that have to be turned in that nobody in the community can help with.

708
01:07:31,751 --> 01:07:33,992
In fact, nobody in the school committee can help with.

709
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:38,174
There are gonna be things like, how much did you spend on maintenance for X number of years?

710
01:07:38,234 --> 01:07:40,715
So somebody's gonna be digging through a whole lot of old receipts.

711
01:07:40,775 --> 01:07:44,677
Hopefully there'll be some of that categorized in the finance system, but I don't know.

712
01:07:45,738 --> 01:07:50,604
So, much of eligibility is just a whole lot of paperwork, frankly.

713
01:07:51,846 --> 01:07:56,552
And so, bringing in getting people excited to join the committee.

714
01:07:58,061 --> 01:08:02,985
And then to have them have a few meetings where they just have presentations on this is how many classrooms we have.

715
01:08:03,985 --> 01:08:06,868
I mean, that doesn't sound exciting to anybody, I don't think.

716
01:08:07,668 --> 01:08:09,730
So I do like this idea.

717
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:22,019
And I think it would be good to lay out when we get to the point in a committee, the whole amount of resolution on defining the committee, to literally lay that out so that people understand that, hey, we didn't

718
01:08:22,739 --> 01:08:27,423
call you up yet, or we haven't even asked you if we decide to do that.

719
01:08:27,864 --> 01:08:31,687
But that doesn't mean that, you know, we don't want your feedback, we don't want you to be part of it.

720
01:08:31,847 --> 01:08:35,170
It's just that in this beginning phase, it just doesn't make any sense.

721
01:08:36,511 --> 01:08:38,353
So that I like that very much.

722
01:08:43,057 --> 01:08:45,479
I'd like to acknowledge our student rep who's on the call.

723
01:08:45,499 --> 01:08:47,561
I think he's been on for quite some time.

724
01:08:47,641 --> 01:08:48,902
Noah, you're Osco.

725
01:08:49,122 --> 01:08:49,923
Thanks for being here.

726
01:08:50,541 --> 01:08:51,062
joining us.

727
01:08:51,523 --> 01:08:54,991
And we also have a resident who would like to speak.

728
01:08:56,053 --> 01:08:57,937
Eunice, if you name and address the record, please.

729
01:08:58,058 --> 01:09:00,102
And Dr. Cushing, if you could unmute.

730
01:09:00,182 --> 01:09:00,443
Thank you.

731
01:09:04,409 --> 01:09:05,090
Hi, good evening.

732
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:06,150
Thank you very much.

733
01:09:07,571 --> 01:09:14,856
I want to preface this with I'm a member of the Medford Charter Study Committee and I am only speaking for myself here.

734
01:09:14,876 --> 01:09:23,501
But I want to second what Member Graham and Member Rousseau said about the level of commitment.

735
01:09:24,682 --> 01:09:28,665
The Medford Charter Committee, like the

736
01:09:29,434 --> 01:09:36,096
you know, building committee has the potential to have a huge impact on Medford as we move forward.

737
01:09:36,976 --> 01:09:49,020
And I think in the case of the building committee, you need to be crystal, crystal clear about the amount of commitment that you're asking of any resident.

738
01:09:51,301 --> 01:09:55,502
The charter committee meets monthly,

739
01:09:57,327 --> 01:10:03,377
And in between that, there's often homework that we have, certainly a lot of reading.

740
01:10:03,458 --> 01:10:07,284
Some of us have been involved in various projects.

741
01:10:07,785 --> 01:10:08,827
We're up to now

742
01:10:10,301 --> 01:10:15,545
15 monthly meetings and we've got subcommittees going, we've got other things going.

743
01:10:15,606 --> 01:10:24,893
So I think if there's, you know, if you're inviting the public to this, I think you need to be very clear about what the commitment is.

744
01:10:26,534 --> 01:10:27,935
How many meetings a month?

745
01:10:28,255 --> 01:10:30,397
Are they regular monthly meetings?

746
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:38,103
Will there be subcommittee meetings in addition to a regular, you know, full group meeting?

747
01:10:38,303 --> 01:10:38,944
Will there be

748
01:10:39,946 --> 01:10:45,567
homework generated from these meetings of whatever it is.

749
01:10:47,147 --> 01:11:00,569
So I think the clarity of the time commitment, the energy commitment and so forth, we've already had additions and subtractions on our committee over the amount of months that we've had.

750
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:09,051
So again, I stress that you really, if you're going to invite the public to this into an unpaid,

751
01:11:09,878 --> 01:11:17,103
position, particularly, which a lot of residents will be more than happy to do to support the endeavor.

752
01:11:17,123 --> 01:11:27,209
I just think that you need to be real clear from the get-go, in terms of hours, days, and so forth, of what's going to be required.

753
01:11:28,009 --> 01:11:35,794
Because as was said, it's not something that you can show up for when you've got a little extra time on your hands.

754
01:11:36,275 --> 01:11:37,355
You've got to be all in.

755
01:11:38,959 --> 01:11:40,080
So thanks very much.

756
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,461
Thank you, Ms.

757
01:11:42,501 --> 01:11:42,781
Brown.

758
01:11:43,682 --> 01:11:44,863
Your address for the record, please.

759
01:11:45,803 --> 01:11:46,503
Greenleaf Ave.

760
01:11:47,484 --> 01:11:48,044
Greenleaf Ave.

761
01:11:48,685 --> 01:11:48,985
Thank you.

762
01:11:49,045 --> 01:11:50,766
And thank you for your service on the Charter Commission.

763
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:51,346
We hear you.

764
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,187
Thank you.

765
01:11:52,907 --> 01:11:58,731
If I may, from the chair, I know that it's going to be a fast process.

766
01:11:59,451 --> 01:12:05,415
And sometimes you really do need time to gain as many applicants and diverse applicants.

767
01:12:05,495 --> 01:12:07,636
So I just want to make sure whoever is going to be

768
01:12:08,151 --> 01:12:30,043
publicize, once we get to that point, make sure that we map out a plan now, maybe that's you, the communications team potentially, map out a plan to make sure that we get this press release or request for applicants out far and wide so that everybody can see it, like you said, get it translated so that we can pull in as diverse committee as possible.

769
01:12:31,127 --> 01:12:31,828
Member Reinfeldt.

770
01:12:32,788 --> 01:12:42,335
So, to be a little bit clearer in terms of my saying what are our gaps, I think we should potentially be looking to fill particular functions and roles on the committee.

771
01:12:42,835 --> 01:12:48,279
I think absolutely representation is important, but what is it that we need to do to get this done.

772
01:12:48,579 --> 01:12:52,042
This is a very logistical process, and particularly at

773
01:12:53,142 --> 01:13:01,507
certain stages and in terms of educating the community about what this is, I would hate for us to run around finding all the things we could tell them.

774
01:13:02,488 --> 01:13:05,670
I think an FAQ would be really helpful.

775
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:10,112
What are the frequent questions we're getting and put together an answer on that?

776
01:13:10,232 --> 01:13:21,759
I do think there should be absolutely points for community input throughout the process, but perhaps in this initial stage, what are the key things that people are asking and that they want to know similar to what we did around

777
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:30,294
I hate to make the comparison to COVID, but there was a very soliciting input and then hopefully answering those questions.

778
01:13:31,334 --> 01:13:31,614
Thank you.

779
01:13:31,674 --> 01:13:32,355
Member Russo?

780
01:13:32,755 --> 01:13:38,817
I just wanted to comment that the Somerville School Building project site has an amazing FAQ system.

781
01:13:38,877 --> 01:13:44,599
I mean, I looked at several, most communities like create a whole website for the project so people know where to go.

782
01:13:46,721 --> 01:13:50,144
frankly, a lot of them didn't have FAQs, but Somerville's is top-notch.

783
01:13:50,184 --> 01:13:58,592
So we don't even have, like, I feel like a lot of the questions you're gonna ask, we're gonna hear, like, wouldn't they be the questions happening in almost every community?

784
01:13:58,692 --> 01:14:01,835
So thank you to everybody who's gone before us.

785
01:14:04,138 --> 01:14:05,179
Member McLaughlin?

786
01:14:05,639 --> 01:14:10,243
So can I make a motion to create a FAQ for the MSBA?

787
01:14:14,654 --> 01:14:15,614
just need a second.

788
01:14:16,515 --> 01:14:17,395
Member McLaughlin.

789
01:14:18,055 --> 01:14:18,436
Second.

790
01:14:18,576 --> 01:14:19,716
Seconded by Member Reinfeld.

791
01:14:19,756 --> 01:14:20,516
All those in favor?

792
01:14:22,017 --> 01:14:22,877
All those opposed?

793
01:14:23,378 --> 01:14:24,258
Motion is approved.

794
01:14:25,578 --> 01:14:39,544
And I don't know how we want to wrap this up, but I know Member Graham listed all the requirements that are as far as people with expertise and officials within the city and school department.

795
01:14:39,564 --> 01:14:41,045
So I don't know if we want to just...

796
01:14:43,666 --> 01:14:44,006
Sorry.

797
01:14:44,127 --> 01:14:46,609
So obviously my mind is a little blown by all of this.

798
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:52,756
This is ridiculously overwhelming, but obviously much needed and willing to do the work.

799
01:14:53,276 --> 01:14:59,323
So just on member McLaughlin's point about the surrounding cities, I mean, I do think that's a great point.

800
01:14:59,483 --> 01:15:00,804
I mean, they're right there.

801
01:15:01,065 --> 01:15:01,245
I mean,

802
01:15:02,088 --> 01:15:06,392
I work in one of those neighboring districts, I worked at one of those brand new high schools this summer.

803
01:15:06,912 --> 01:15:09,974
So, I mean, could we pick someone's brain?

804
01:15:10,355 --> 01:15:11,536
Am I thinking too small?

805
01:15:12,096 --> 01:15:25,107
Like, member Brantley goes there and says, Hey, can someone give me like 10 points of, am I being too narrow minded to think that that, you know, like could go somewhere and say,

806
01:15:25,728 --> 01:15:51,503
you know, hey, like I just remember in the building that I was working in over the summer, there was a comment, I think at some point, and maybe like too much glass, you know, that it was, you know, an issue, you know, heating, cooling, safety, just little things that had popped up that we could say, yeah, we might not wanna do that in the foyer of the brand new Medford High School.

807
01:15:51,563 --> 01:15:52,644
So is,

808
01:15:53,635 --> 01:16:11,651
Am I being too narrow-minded to think that I could be a point person for a neighboring district and maybe, you know, if someone else volunteered or something to say, can you, can I just pick your brain so that we're not in a 400 person Zoom call that, cause that doesn't seem like much gets done in a 400 person Zoom call.

809
01:16:12,892 --> 01:16:18,958
To think that you could just go in and say, you know, maybe just maybe from like a safety aspect or a,

810
01:16:20,185 --> 01:16:24,808
logistics of, you know, the driveway, you know, whatever, those little things.

811
01:16:26,269 --> 01:16:27,790
Is that, is that a possibility?

812
01:16:28,431 --> 01:16:33,514
I think it is, but I think tonight is about what we want within a committee, right?

813
01:16:33,614 --> 01:16:33,994
Okay.

814
01:16:34,475 --> 01:16:38,797
We're going to get there, but tell me when within a committee, what are we going to be?

815
01:16:38,817 --> 01:16:47,143
The superintendent, the chief procurement officer, the mayor or designee school committee member, principal, CFO, maintenance architect.

816
01:16:47,403 --> 01:16:48,144
What are we missing?

817
01:16:48,484 --> 01:16:49,965
How large do we want this committee to be?

818
01:16:50,526 --> 01:17:02,931
And if we want to take ideas from other surrounding communities, we'd have to do that research and whether you want to table this for tonight and everybody look at a community and we come back and brainstorm ideas, but every community has done it differently.

819
01:17:03,031 --> 01:17:10,314
So, we want to do what's right for Medford, what's right for us, and I don't know what the right answer is that's kind of what we're discussing tonight.

820
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,515
Remember Graham and you go offline member Rousseau.

821
01:17:14,335 --> 01:17:15,696
You know one suggestion.

822
01:17:15,776 --> 01:17:20,440
I think there's a really low risk of us like duplicating effort.

823
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:27,406
So if you know somebody on this in Somerville, who can like have that conversation with you.

824
01:17:27,687 --> 01:17:31,490
I think it's would be great for us all to go out and do our own legwork.

825
01:17:32,892 --> 01:17:35,873
through our networks and have some of those conversations.

826
01:17:36,353 --> 01:17:41,274
Representative Garbally offered to provide us a tour or tours at any time.

827
01:17:41,294 --> 01:17:43,135
He is happy to accompany us.

828
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:50,097
I'm sure he's not going to give us the tour because he doesn't work in the building, but he said he'd be very happy to help arrange something like that in Arlington.

829
01:17:50,837 --> 01:17:52,578
And Christine Barber said the same.

830
01:17:52,618 --> 01:17:52,958
Rep.

831
01:17:53,058 --> 01:17:54,578
Barber said the same thing in Somerville.

832
01:17:55,018 --> 01:18:00,400
I do think that once the building committee is formed, they will also want to do those things.

833
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:07,442
We may want to hold off on like trying to tour places until there's a little bit more clarity on the building committee.

834
01:18:07,522 --> 01:18:25,869
But I think in the meantime, for us to be sort of talking to people and fact finding and collecting information, I think if people are able to do that in advance of a committee of the whole at the end of February, at some point, I can take a shot at drafting like something that looks like what we've been talking about.

835
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:37,763
And we can start the meeting with like, what, what information did you find and sort of share some information across the various members of the committee who were able to go out and talk to you know whomever.

836
01:18:38,724 --> 01:18:44,271
My cousin is a member of a school committee in the southern part of the state, and they're in the middle of a building project.

837
01:18:44,691 --> 01:18:49,395
So there's, you know, there's lots of people that we know who have like participated in this and gone through it.

838
01:18:50,115 --> 01:18:56,580
And I think that would be really appropriate to lead off a conversation that then looks at like a nitty gritty resolution about how we might do this.

839
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:01,124
So I don't think there's any reason not to do that, if there are people willing to talk to you.

840
01:19:01,844 --> 01:19:11,172
And I also find that anybody that I've ever contacted through MASC, where I've been seeking information about a district, like people are very happy to engage.

841
01:19:11,292 --> 01:19:11,472
So

842
01:19:12,321 --> 01:19:19,707
I suppose there's maybe small risk if we all call the same person, but I feel like they're just gonna tell you like, hey, I just talked to somebody from your committee.

843
01:19:20,207 --> 01:19:29,694
So I think it's probably fine for us to reach out to our networks and then share that information back when we get to the committee of the whole that talks about how we might put this together.

844
01:19:32,857 --> 01:19:33,157
Thank you.

845
01:19:33,237 --> 01:19:35,179
Member McLaughlin, then Member Russo.

846
01:19:35,899 --> 01:19:36,700
Yeah, I would agree.

847
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:40,062
I think that it's important to gather information before making the decisions.

848
01:19:40,082 --> 01:19:41,884
And I think it makes sense to have

849
01:19:43,819 --> 01:20:02,777
people reach out to folks that they can and also I do like the idea of either subcommittees or advisory committees because I do feel like that's where a lot of the legwork can get done and that we're not having an overwhelmingly large building committee and potentially even stages within the building committee.

850
01:20:02,797 --> 01:20:04,298
I think these are all great ideas.

851
01:20:04,839 --> 01:20:05,679
I do want to say and

852
01:20:06,929 --> 01:20:09,931
I think we need to be thinking about how we're being inclusive, right?

853
01:20:09,951 --> 01:20:22,478
And so I'm not just talking about, well, community members or whatever, I'm talking about whoever we're thinking about in the buildings that we're being diverse and inclusive, that we're thinking about what that makeup looks like, that we're really sort of being thoughtful and just sort of as we go into it.

854
01:20:23,019 --> 01:20:29,543
And then I did, I appreciate Representative Garbally's offer and Representative Barber's offer.

855
01:20:29,563 --> 01:20:32,184
I think those are lovely offers and I think we should take them up on it.

856
01:20:32,224 --> 01:20:34,786
I agree, we don't want to overstay our welcome or overuse.

857
01:20:35,607 --> 01:20:47,435
an invitation and I'm sure superintendent can reach out to her superintendent colleagues at each of those buildings as well and get a tour for us.

858
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:57,763
I think it makes sense to have the building committee tour, but I would also respectfully ask that school committee members are participating in those tours so that we can also see.

859
01:20:57,783 --> 01:21:03,987
I know when I'm renovating a house or anything like that, I love to go look at other people's houses and see

860
01:21:04,737 --> 01:21:12,639
what they did and what worked for me and what didn't, and that I spend way too much time on Pinterest, so we can create a Pinterest board for our high school, I guess.

861
01:21:14,999 --> 01:21:16,159
Anyway, I'm looking forward to it.

862
01:21:16,179 --> 01:21:17,280
I think it's all very exciting.

863
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:24,941
I think it's thoughtful that we're having these conversations, and I would just ask that we don't make decisions tonight, that maybe we just are having the conversation.

864
01:21:26,422 --> 01:21:31,303
Also, so is there a motion to send this committee the whole unless we want to keep talking and try to hash this out tonight?

865
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:38,124
I would make a motion that we schedule a committee of the whole for the end of February, like after February break.

866
01:21:38,724 --> 01:21:44,769
Member Graham, motion to schedule committee of the whole, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

867
01:21:44,789 --> 01:21:45,549
All those in favor?

868
01:21:45,569 --> 01:21:45,809
Aye.

869
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:46,730
All those opposed?

870
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:47,591
Motion passes.

871
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:52,014
2024-5, offered by Member Rousseau.

872
01:21:52,034 --> 01:21:55,036
I'm not sure if these are numbered right.

873
01:21:55,056 --> 01:21:55,076
24-5.

874
01:21:56,417 --> 01:21:59,800
You do it every meeting is new?

875
01:22:04,684 --> 01:22:05,424
Oh, we've only done three?

876
01:22:05,484 --> 01:22:06,024
Okay, thanks.

877
01:22:07,265 --> 01:22:15,509
Medford School Committee Policy Bullying Prevention and Intervention Plan will be updated by removing the text three or more incidents.

878
01:22:16,629 --> 01:22:21,011
Motion for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

879
01:22:21,031 --> 01:22:21,791
All those in favor?

880
01:22:21,812 --> 01:22:21,872
Aye.

881
01:22:23,143 --> 01:22:23,924
Are those opposed?

882
01:22:24,504 --> 01:22:25,385
Motion passes.

883
01:22:25,545 --> 01:22:26,987
Member Russo?

884
01:22:27,327 --> 01:22:34,294
I'd like to make a motion to waive the second reading of the policy JICFB that we just discussed.

885
01:22:35,295 --> 01:22:41,481
Motion to waive the second reading of this policy by member Russo, seconded by member Reinfeld.

886
01:22:41,701 --> 01:22:42,422
All those in favor?

887
01:22:42,742 --> 01:22:42,822
Aye.

888
01:22:43,022 --> 01:22:44,023
All those opposed?

889
01:22:44,884 --> 01:22:45,785
Second reading is waived.

890
01:22:46,872 --> 01:23:07,857
2024-6 offered by myself, Mayor Longo Kern, whereas, oh, whereas all security cameras were recently fixed thanks to the collaboration of the school and city teams, be it resolved that the school IT director provide a monthly status report to the school and city administration and replace anything that breaks down within 45 days.

891
01:23:08,477 --> 01:23:10,217
And I put this on just as an update.

892
01:23:10,537 --> 01:23:12,358
We've worked over the last several months

893
01:23:13,188 --> 01:23:16,850
get the 30 to 35% of cameras that were broken fixed.

894
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:26,035
That was a collaboration, a lot of pushing from Paul Riggi, who's our facilities maintenance director, Rich Lane, the city's IT director, along with the school team.

895
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:28,536
And we were able to get those fixed.

896
01:23:28,556 --> 01:23:30,717
So as of Friday, all of our cameras are working.

897
01:23:30,777 --> 01:23:33,198
It's been a huge, it's a huge accomplishment.

898
01:23:33,599 --> 01:23:36,540
I know the school committee has been pushing to get that done.

899
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:39,702
So I'm very happy to say that it is done.

900
01:23:40,464 --> 01:23:42,565
want to make sure that it stays that way.

901
01:23:42,585 --> 01:23:59,995
So I think it's incumbent upon the IT director to evaluate the system monthly and give a report to the superintendent and hopefully myself so that we can make sure anything that's broken down is getting fixed so we don't land ourself in the same position five years from now.

902
01:24:00,615 --> 01:24:06,719
So I do like a motion with a roll call if that's... Question, Mayor?

903
01:24:06,879 --> 01:24:07,519
Member McLaughlin.

904
01:24:07,932 --> 01:24:31,780
just in terms of you said, letting the school, the superintendent and yourself know, just in terms of the breaking or if there are cameras sort of, you know, out of service or what have you, but can we add an amendment to this, that we are notified quarterly, school committee is notified quarterly on those so that we're kept up to date, you know, you guys monthly and us quarterly, so that we're making sure that they're actually being repaired and not just getting notices that they're broken.

905
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,521
May I ask a question for member Rousseau?

906
01:24:35,966 --> 01:24:40,890
I fully support this, except for the fact that we'd have to have executive session to receive that report.

907
01:24:43,173 --> 01:24:43,833
On security.

908
01:24:45,395 --> 01:24:47,817
That's why I didn't say the school committee, to be honest with you.

909
01:24:51,621 --> 01:25:00,529
We have the building and grounds team, maybe twice a year they can bring up security in part of their meeting in executive session and get an update.

910
01:25:04,441 --> 01:25:04,921
Who's the chair?

911
01:25:04,961 --> 01:25:07,542
Oh, the chair of the Building and Grounds is... We're not there yet.

912
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:08,403
Yes.

913
01:25:08,823 --> 01:25:11,924
Member Brindley, maybe we can make sure that's on the agenda.

914
01:25:11,944 --> 01:25:14,385
Shall I add that to my list of things to do?

915
01:25:14,525 --> 01:25:15,646
Yes, please.

916
01:25:17,106 --> 01:25:27,591
So maybe note it for June or September to just put it on the... If you have a subcommittee meeting, just get an update, and you can add the 10-minute executive session to that meeting.

917
01:25:31,332 --> 01:25:31,613
Thank you.

918
01:25:31,633 --> 01:25:32,553

offered by myself and member Graham be resolved.

Mayor?

948
01:26:57,785 --> 01:26:59,286
Member McLaughlin.

949
01:27:00,247 --> 01:27:00,647
Thank you.

950
01:27:02,308 --> 01:27:11,852
I was just curious about whether or not we had added a motion to include a strategic and capital planning subcommittee.

951
01:27:14,693 --> 01:27:17,514
That wasn't one of the subcommittees previously, right?

952
01:27:17,554 --> 01:27:19,235
And do we need to add a motion for that?

953
01:27:19,255 --> 01:27:21,235
I guess I wasn't, was that on the list?

954
01:27:21,635 --> 01:27:22,516
When we discussed that at 80?

955
01:27:22,556 --> 01:27:24,777
Either way, we can approve this or amend it.

956
01:27:24,997 --> 01:27:25,997
What was that?

957
01:27:26,077 --> 01:27:26,918
Member Graham.

958
01:27:28,556 --> 01:27:43,586
So one of the questions that we asked in, well, a couple of the questions that we asked in the survey was whether there were committees that folks felt we didn't need anymore, and there actually was one, and that was the personal and budget subcommittee, so that's not going forward.

959
01:27:43,606 --> 01:27:50,771
But we recreate these committees every two years, so they're not required to be anything in particular.

960
01:27:50,831 --> 01:27:53,893
And then the other piece of feedback that we did get was that,

961
01:27:55,464 --> 01:28:06,692
we need a place and a home and a space for capital planning because we have been talking about capital planning for 4 years and we've really not gotten rigorous about it.

962
01:28:06,792 --> 01:28:08,373
So, we need a place and a space for that.

963
01:28:08,433 --> 01:28:09,874
So, that's how that came to be.

964
01:28:09,974 --> 01:28:16,578
So, that all of those changes were based on the feedback that everybody submitted when they submitted what they said they wanted from the committees.

965
01:28:21,042 --> 01:28:21,922
Yes, thank you.

966
01:28:22,442 --> 01:28:24,584
I think that's helpful in terms of

967
01:28:25,154 --> 01:28:26,315
certainly I think it's needed.

968
01:28:26,335 --> 01:28:35,843
I think that I think we really need to discuss the process of the subcommittees because we haven't really talked about what this process is and what it looks like.

969
01:28:36,504 --> 01:28:53,378
And while I think it was super helpful this year to have a questionnaire for committee members to determine their preferences around the committees, I think it was a little bit ambiguous about where that information went and how it was used and how it was going to be

970
01:28:54,546 --> 01:29:23,046
incorporated and so I think I'd like to be a little bit clearer about what the process is and maybe you know I don't think at this hour of the meeting it's a good time to do that but I guess I'll give that some thought but I would just like my the committee members to consider the process so that if we are as a team working together to create subcommittees we should be as a team identifying

971
01:29:23,675 --> 01:29:27,617
the different subcommittees that are going to exist for the upcoming term.

972
01:29:28,217 --> 01:29:45,484
And then also if it is the chair that is choosing the subcommittees that the chair, I mean, yeah, that the chair is establishing what that process would be around how information or how people can get information to the chair.

973
01:29:45,524 --> 01:29:48,345
So I think again, the form was super helpful.

974
01:29:48,405 --> 01:29:52,747
I just think it was kind of ad hoc and, you know, put together and I don't think the committee

975
01:29:53,407 --> 01:29:55,948
collectively decided how that process was going to work.

976
01:29:56,048 --> 01:30:04,453
And I think we need to, um, especially when we're no longer here and other people are doing it and they need to have a basis for how it needs to be done.

977
01:30:04,973 --> 01:30:17,400
So, um, I would like us to consider that there needs to be a process for the subcommittees and what that process for the creation of subcommittees and identification of members of subcommittees and what that process should look like.

978
01:30:20,341 --> 01:30:21,982
Member Russo motion to approve.

979
01:30:22,608 --> 01:30:26,972
Motion for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

980
01:30:27,332 --> 01:30:28,153
All those in favor?

981
01:30:28,173 --> 01:30:28,973
Aye.

982
01:30:29,253 --> 01:30:30,074
All those opposed?

983
01:30:30,975 --> 01:30:31,996
Motion is approved.

984
01:30:32,016 --> 01:30:48,909
224-2024-8 offered by Member Graham, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee establish an ad hoc subcommittee to establish a process and norms around annual handbook review per the resolution passed unanimously on 11-20-2024.

985
01:30:51,499 --> 01:31:03,435
It also resolved that the subcommittee will be established at the February 5 school committee meeting and will work to complete the process as close to the original deadline of April 1 2024 is reasonably possible member Graham.

986
01:31:04,124 --> 01:31:04,524
Thank you.

987
01:31:05,446 --> 01:31:21,784
Back in November we talked about the need to just have an ad hoc committee much like we did with the superintendent evaluation process last time around to say, how can we move through what amounts to seven handbooks.

988
01:31:24,138 --> 01:31:29,663
four, five, six, seven, eight school handbooks, all of which are supposed to be approved to us when changes are made.

989
01:31:29,683 --> 01:31:38,030
And I think what we've found over time is that the handbooks continue to change, but they haven't come to this committee to say, are they approved or not?

990
01:31:38,150 --> 01:31:49,959
And so I think there's just some work to be done that would lay out like how we would even go about that process before we can sort of dive into actually looking at

991
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:58,162
handbooks and approving them because it's not effective for seven of us to sit around and look at, you know, many page documents.

992
01:31:58,222 --> 01:32:08,765
So the goal of the committee would be to figure out what the process should be, whatever it might be, to make sure that we have a routine in place that

993
01:32:09,349 --> 01:32:17,611
does this on a regular basis and does so in a way that is sort of consistent with the school calendar and how the schools move through their handbook process.

994
01:32:17,651 --> 01:32:32,514
So my motion is just that tonight we identify volunteers to go through a sort of subcommittee process to figure out how should this work going forward so it's sustainable.

995
01:32:34,754 --> 01:32:35,054
That's all.

996
01:32:35,694 --> 01:32:37,255
Thank you, member Graham.

997
01:32:37,755 --> 01:32:39,035
Member Rousseau, member Reinfeld?

998
01:32:39,770 --> 01:32:40,170
Thank you.

999
01:32:41,151 --> 01:32:43,073
I certainly agree.

1000
01:32:43,113 --> 01:32:48,297
I thought that that worked well with the superintendent evaluation process that was developed.

1001
01:32:49,098 --> 01:32:55,503
And I just want to be clear that this is not a motion to do the handbooks.

1002
01:32:55,563 --> 01:33:01,588
This is to have three of us get together and figure out, well, how will we do the handbooks?

1003
01:33:02,649 --> 01:33:04,971
So I certainly would motion to approve.

1004
01:33:07,493 --> 01:33:07,933
I second.

1005
01:33:07,973 --> 01:33:08,714
That was my question.

1006
01:33:09,437 --> 01:33:12,539
Great motion for approval by member Rousseau, seconded by member Reinfeld.

1007
01:33:12,599 --> 01:33:13,460
All those in favor?

1008
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:14,361
Aye.

1009
01:33:14,621 --> 01:33:15,321
All those opposed?

1010
01:33:15,361 --> 01:33:16,182
Motion passes.

1011
01:33:17,703 --> 01:33:19,144
Mayor, are there any volunteers?

1012
01:33:19,984 --> 01:33:20,465
Oh, that's right.

1013
01:33:21,185 --> 01:33:23,027
Who would like to serve on this ad hoc committee?

1014
01:33:24,908 --> 01:33:25,769
Member Olopade.

1015
01:33:27,670 --> 01:33:28,270
I am willing.

1016
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:32,293
I defer to a member who is willing.

1017
01:33:32,633 --> 01:33:36,016
If anyone is gung ho, they can have it, but I'm absolutely.

1018
01:33:36,616 --> 01:33:38,397
Okay, member Olopade, member Reinfeld.

1019
01:33:38,698 --> 01:33:39,138
And Rousseau.

1020
01:33:39,796 --> 01:33:40,597
And member Rousseau.

1021
01:33:40,617 --> 01:33:47,101
Looks like I'm on the building committee, so thank you for taking that one.

1022
01:33:48,802 --> 01:33:50,504
That's going to be your excuse for everything now.

1023
01:33:51,544 --> 01:33:52,225
Well, it depends.

1024
01:33:52,285 --> 01:33:54,346
Monday night is school committee.

1025
01:33:54,426 --> 01:33:55,767
Tuesday night, city council.

1026
01:33:55,807 --> 01:33:56,668
I got to pay attention.

1027
01:33:56,708 --> 01:33:59,030
Wednesday night, the hall's open late, so that will just be mine.

1028
01:34:00,671 --> 01:34:05,274
OK, so member El-Padre, member Reinfeldt, member Rousseau will be on the committee.

1029
01:34:05,294 --> 01:34:06,575
Thank you so much for volunteering.

1030
01:34:07,711 --> 01:34:09,111
Motion for approval of that committee?

1031
01:34:09,551 --> 01:34:10,212
Motion to approve.

1032
01:34:10,532 --> 01:34:15,493

Aye.

1036
01:34:17,834 --> 01:34:18,654

We do not have reports requested and we have one condolence.

Members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Paula A. Gianelli-Coughlin, early childhood educator of the Medford Public Schools.

1040
01:34:33,277 --> 01:34:35,718
If we all may rise for a moment of silence.

1041
01:34:47,910 --> 01:34:48,230
Thank you.

01:34:55,516 --> 01:34:57,037
here in the Alden Memorial Chambers.

1044
01:34:57,177 --> 01:34:58,378
Can't wait to see you all again.
