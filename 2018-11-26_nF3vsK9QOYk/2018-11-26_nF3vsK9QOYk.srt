1
00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:13,320
[SPEAKER_15]: But before we get started, I'd like to take a few minutes to acknowledge and thank a few people who are here today.

2
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:22,546
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, the Hall of Fame Board of Directors is here today, many of them, almost every single one of us.

3
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:25,708
[SPEAKER_15]: If you would please stand as I read your name.

4
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:27,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Janet Lennon McGuire.

5
00:00:37,657 --> 00:00:54,345
[SPEAKER_15]: And then last but not least, Megan Richard who is our Vice President.

6
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:15,879
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything that works today, everything that's good about this event, all the logistics, the wheels, everything, give credit to Megan.

7
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:26,529
[SPEAKER_15]: If anything goes wrong, talk to me.

8
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:27,790
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, thank you to the board.

9
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,213
[SPEAKER_15]: We've had a great year leading up to this induction ceremony.

10
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:36,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Very talented and what's the word?

11
00:01:36,517 --> 00:01:41,540
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess people who contribute a lot of their time and good thoughts to the successful fate of the board.

12
00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:43,295
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

13
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,636
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd also like to recognize a few individuals.

14
00:01:47,537 --> 00:01:50,437
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure if any of them are here.

15
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:56,499
[SPEAKER_15]: However, first of all, this is Josephine Monquette, who's the wife of Hall of Famer Bill Monquette.

16
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,680
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, something came up with her family.

17
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,121
[SPEAKER_15]: She could not join us today.

18
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,222
[SPEAKER_15]: She said she'd be back at the next one, so hopefully we'll see her there.

19
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:10,084
[SPEAKER_15]: But she and Bill have been, over the years, very consistent and generous supporters of the Hall of Fame.

20
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,822
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, Tom Frieda, did Tom make it?

21
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:19,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Tom's our tax guy, he volunteers to do that.

22
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,431
[SPEAKER_15]: Some people twisted his arm to do it, but he still does it anyway.

23
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:24,092
[SPEAKER_15]: He tries to keep us out of trouble.

24
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:26,094
[SPEAKER_15]: And Chris Hurley, did Chris make it?

25
00:02:27,055 --> 00:02:27,736
[SPEAKER_15]: Is Chris here?

26
00:02:28,336 --> 00:02:31,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Chris, you may recognize his name, he's one of the sports writers.

27
00:02:32,796 --> 00:02:37,758
[SPEAKER_15]: for the local coverage of the federal transcript and other cities and towns nearby.

28
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:46,662
[SPEAKER_15]: And you may also have noticed the 11 or 12 articles that he wrote about almost every inductee that's here today.

29
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:51,485
[SPEAKER_15]: But certainly all the athletes that are here today were had articles written about them.

30
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,185
[SPEAKER_15]: So thanks to Chris.

31
00:02:55,875 --> 00:03:03,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Occasionally at our lecture ceremonies, we also give a special thank you to someone.

32
00:03:06,381 --> 00:03:07,601
[SPEAKER_15]: Reggie, come up.

33
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:13,705
[SPEAKER_15]: From time to time, there are individuals who will, for a sustained period of time, help us.

34
00:03:13,765 --> 00:03:15,786
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm going to let Reggie carry it from here.

35
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:23,590
[SPEAKER_31]: Good afternoon, everyone.

36
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:31,418
[SPEAKER_31]: It's my pleasure to introduce a young man who's known to you all.

37
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:45,687
[SPEAKER_31]: From January of 19, excuse me, January of 1988 to January of 2016, he was the mayor of the city of Medford.

38
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:53,813
[SPEAKER_31]: During that time, he rebuilt all the elementary and public, elementary and middle schools, put some stipends,

39
00:03:54,478 --> 00:03:56,680
[SPEAKER_31]: came out to be $110 million.

40
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:04,185
[SPEAKER_31]: He's always been a supporter or a staunch supporter of the Method High School sports and the Mustang Hall of Fame.

41
00:04:05,105 --> 00:04:22,618
[SPEAKER_31]: Today, we would like to present to Michael J. McGlynn, in appreciation for your many years of service and support of the Mustang Hall of Fame and the Mustang High School Athletics, presented by the Mustang Hall of Fame,

42
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,602
[SPEAKER_31]: November 18th, 2018, Mr. McGlynn.

43
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:13,119
[SPEAKER_15]: Next, I'd like to introduce a few supporters of the Hall of Fame, each of whom will make a few remarks as I introduce them.

44
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,062
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, the principal of the Medford Vocational Technical High School, Chad Fallon.

45
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:27,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Chad, are you here?

46
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:29,465
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a few words, great.

47
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:39,988
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you for having me.

48
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:41,589
[SPEAKER_29]: I just finished my first year at Medford.

49
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,252
[SPEAKER_29]: This event is surely one of the many reasons why Medford has been such a good choice for me.

50
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:49,274
[SPEAKER_29]: So thank you for giving me a great first year.

51
00:05:49,654 --> 00:05:52,015
[SPEAKER_29]: Congratulations to all of you tonight, and enjoy the afternoon.

52
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:52,396
Thank you.

53
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,323
[SPEAKER_15]: The headmaster of Medford High School, Mr. Paul DeLiva.

54
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:21,832
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing I'd like to say is I'm back.

55
00:06:22,152 --> 00:06:23,373
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I want to thank everyone.

56
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:30,474
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a wonderful honor to be asked to be here tonight, especially for me because I'm looking at students that I had.

57
00:06:30,494 --> 00:06:32,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a teacher at Mekong High School.

58
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:44,787
[SPEAKER_03]: and to see how they developed, and I've coached some of them, I've taught them in a lot of ways, and just seeing those faces really, really resonates to me that why we do what we do as educators.

59
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:49,611
[SPEAKER_03]: People on the board, for example, Mr. Paul Malatow was sort of like a mentor of mine.

60
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:58,678
[SPEAKER_03]: He would tell me, you know, school never ends at 218, and that's true, especially when it comes to athletics, because you're there all the time, 24-7,

61
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,514
[SPEAKER_03]: showing what you care about Medford High School.

62
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:10,137
[SPEAKER_03]: And just honored to be in this room with so many great people and congratulations everyone that is being inducted today.

63
00:07:10,257 --> 00:07:20,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

64
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:25,344
[SPEAKER_15]: The Superintendent of Medford Public Schools, Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent.

65
00:07:38,537 --> 00:07:40,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon everyone.

66
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,603
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so excited to be here today.

67
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:46,388
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my very first Hall of Fame event.

68
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:52,797
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, I was born in Medford and grew up in Medford, but I did not attend public schools.

69
00:07:56,497 --> 00:07:57,738
[SPEAKER_00]: remaining three are Cougars.

70
00:07:58,418 --> 00:08:02,640
[SPEAKER_00]: But nonetheless, I'm very, very excited to be here to celebrate with all of you.

71
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,903
[SPEAKER_00]: All of you who are wearing the blue tags, congratulations on the awards that you've received in the past.

72
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:13,545
[SPEAKER_00]: And those of you who are wearing the white tags, congratulations today.

73
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:15,766
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited to be part of this event with you.

74
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:23,110
[SPEAKER_00]: And I continue, I look forward to continuing to see more Mustangs become Hall of Famers.

75
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,050
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a great rest of the day.

76
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,943
[SPEAKER_15]: the Honorable Stephanie Kirkpatrick.

77
00:08:38,123 --> 00:08:49,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Good afternoon, everyone.

78
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:53,630
[SPEAKER_28]: As you can clearly see, Meckerd has gone through a year of change.

79
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,252
[SPEAKER_28]: Many people have moved from one school to another, like Mr. Tucci and Mr. DeLeva.

80
00:08:58,778 --> 00:09:06,587
[SPEAKER_28]: and a new superintendent, so we're really thrilled to have such new faces and just the spirit, the Mustang spirit live on.

81
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,471
[SPEAKER_28]: Congratulations to all those being inducted today.

82
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:11,850
[SPEAKER_28]: You join a very elite group of people.

83
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:14,552
[SPEAKER_28]: And I know that your blue and white runs through.

84
00:09:15,173 --> 00:09:15,873
[SPEAKER_28]: It runs in me.

85
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:17,715
[SPEAKER_28]: It runs in most of us in this room.

86
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:20,116
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm forever proud to be a Mustang, always.

87
00:09:21,217 --> 00:09:24,560
[SPEAKER_28]: And thank you to the Hall of Fame committee for all the work you do.

88
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,461
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, we've had so much change.

89
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:37,449
[SPEAKER_28]: The one thing that is constant has been the work that you have all done year in and year out to put this together and to memorialize the wonderful athletes and citizens that they all are.

90
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:38,710
[SPEAKER_28]: So enjoy your lunch.

91
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:57,674
I'd also like to, this is driving me nuts.

92
00:09:59,214 --> 00:09:59,735
It doesn't.

93
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:14,022
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully, does that look better?

94
00:10:14,382 --> 00:10:15,903
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, I can't lean.

95
00:10:16,003 --> 00:10:17,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you hear me?

96
00:10:17,844 --> 00:10:18,544
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

97
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:23,246
[SPEAKER_15]: Because next I'm throwing the mic out, I'm going to scream.

98
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:27,652
[SPEAKER_15]: And my voice is not quite what it used to be when I was yelling from behind the plate or on the ice.

99
00:10:28,413 --> 00:10:32,738
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd also like to acknowledge Diane Caldwell, who's here today.

100
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:47,619
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for joining us and recognizing the inductees and soon-to-be new members of the Hall of Fame.

101
00:10:47,819 --> 00:11:07,634
[SPEAKER_15]: I've only been on the board for about eight years and four inductions, and I don't know how far back when I'm gonna say it's true, but this is the first time that I know of personally the mayor, the superintendent, the associate superintendent, the headmaster, the principal of a vocational school,

102
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:10,836
[SPEAKER_15]: Did I forget anyone?

103
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:11,637
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

104
00:11:11,857 --> 00:11:12,477
[SPEAKER_15]: Two principals.

105
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:13,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Two principals.

106
00:11:13,858 --> 00:11:15,919
[SPEAKER_15]: Nick, 2G, a hall of famer as well.

107
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:27,531
[SPEAKER_15]: You may have had three, maybe four, but never whatever number that adds up to.

108
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:30,952
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you all very much.

109
00:11:31,272 --> 00:11:39,775
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think you will realize how much this means to the attendees here and the inductees in particular, but also the board.

110
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:42,936
[SPEAKER_15]: We really appreciate that kind of support for our organization.

111
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:44,997
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you again.

112
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:52,226
[SPEAKER_15]: Today we'll be inducting 14 new members into the Mustang Hall of Fame.

113
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:54,767
[SPEAKER_15]: This is our primary purpose.

114
00:11:56,568 --> 00:12:00,570
[SPEAKER_15]: Our mission statement, which you can find on our website online if you want to read it again.

115
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,332
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't have to take notes now, but our mission statement says,

116
00:12:05,963 --> 00:12:21,215
[SPEAKER_15]: The Medford Mustang Hall of Fame is an organization dedicated to honoring and recognizing those exceptional athletes, coaches, community leaders, alumni, and teams who have made outstanding contributions to the Medford High School Athletic Program.

117
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:34,545
[SPEAKER_15]: In addition to bridging all generations of Medford High School athletes, coaches, community leaders, alumni, and teams, the Mustang Hall of Fame promotes the current Medford High School Athletic Program.

118
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:38,669
[SPEAKER_15]: We take this mission very seriously.

119
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:43,233
[SPEAKER_15]: You may have noticed the phrase bridging generations.

120
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:59,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, today we have an inductee from the class of 2013, another inductee from the class of 1999, I think, another one from 1934, another one from 1945, and another one from, what's the number? 1906.

121
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:10,950
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know how many generations that is, but it's a lot.

122
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:20,817
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I think it's important to recognize as far back as we can and collect information on people who should be considered for induction if not inducted.

123
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:26,922
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's a pretty good span of athletic talent across a different high school.

124
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:40,943
[SPEAKER_15]: You may also have noticed that, some of you anyway, that we've added two categories to be considered for induction.

125
00:13:41,683 --> 00:13:47,625
[SPEAKER_15]: We've added teams, which in the past were honored, but now teams can be inducted.

126
00:13:48,365 --> 00:13:50,825
[SPEAKER_15]: We've also added a category called alumni.

127
00:13:52,625 --> 00:14:01,267
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll be reading more about this and hearing more about it as we get into next year, but get your thinking caps on, because one thing we never had enough of is nominations.

128
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:14,309
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of nominations, we accept nominations 365 days a year, except in late years when we take it for an extra day.

129
00:14:14,349 --> 00:14:16,910
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm only exaggerating a little.

130
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:23,592
[SPEAKER_15]: We never have enough nominations of people, anyone to nominate, anywhere, to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.

131
00:14:24,152 --> 00:14:33,674
[SPEAKER_15]: We only have two requirements, generally, for applicants in particular, is that they be a graduate of Medford High School, and they be of five years.

132
00:14:35,413 --> 00:14:38,616
[SPEAKER_15]: Other than that, there are no specific criteria.

133
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:48,304
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you look through the list of accomplishments of the folks who are being inducted today, I think it's pages four or five, you'll see some pretty significant accomplishments.

134
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:53,669
[SPEAKER_15]: But there are more folks out there who have similar accomplishments that we don't know about.

135
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:57,132
[SPEAKER_15]: The board does not nominate all the inductees.

136
00:14:57,712 --> 00:14:59,134
[SPEAKER_15]: We may even nominate one or two.

137
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:07,396
[SPEAKER_15]: All the other nominations come from people who are here in this room, people who aren't in the room today who have nominated in the past.

138
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:18,239
[SPEAKER_15]: It comes from the community of athletics and the community of Medford interested alums, I guess, is the best way to put it.

139
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:22,020
[SPEAKER_15]: People who have a connection to Medford High School and Medford High School athletics.

140
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,781
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you know anyone, please let us know.

141
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,662
[SPEAKER_15]: It starts with a name, and then we go from there.

142
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:42,191
[SPEAKER_15]: The process, also once a person is nominated, their nomination remains active or remains in consideration every time we have an induction ceremony.

143
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:50,197
[SPEAKER_15]: So we don't need to induct someone more than once, but we can always add more details to their folder for consideration.

144
00:15:54,217 --> 00:15:58,660
[SPEAKER_15]: In terms of the process, the deadline for nominations for this class was June 30th.

145
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:13,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Normally it's June 30th of the year of the induction, which will be June 30th, 2020, so there's plenty of time to start collecting that information for your next nomination.

146
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:19,732
[SPEAKER_15]: And the board is always available, any board member and every board member is available to help nominations.

147
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:25,257
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you're not sure how to do it, let's start with a name and then go from there.

148
00:16:25,337 --> 00:16:27,698
[SPEAKER_15]: But a board member will be happy to work with anyone.

149
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,899
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it sounds like I'm talking about nominations too much, I'm not.

150
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:35,961
[SPEAKER_15]: As I just said, we get a lot of good ones, but we never get enough.

151
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:42,843
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a lot more athletes out there that deserve to be recognized, as well as community service and teams and so forth.

152
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:58,409
[SPEAKER_15]: If you have any questions about the nomination process, please see me or any member of the board and they'll direct you to me because no one else wants to talk about it.

153
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,091
[SPEAKER_15]: On the inside cover and on page three, you can see our agenda.

154
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:07,672
[SPEAKER_15]: We ask that you remain the entire ceremony.

155
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:16,014
[SPEAKER_15]: Out of respect in particular to the nominees who will be inducted toward the end of the program, we also have a group

156
00:17:17,693 --> 00:17:24,635
[SPEAKER_15]: a picture for the new members of the Hall of Fame and others at the end of the ceremony.

157
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:27,696
[SPEAKER_15]: So we do hope that you, we do expect that you will stay for that.

158
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:32,518
[SPEAKER_15]: We will do our best to stay on time.

159
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:45,482
[SPEAKER_15]: So as has been our tradition over the years, we will induct our first class, first inductee into the Hall of Fame before we have our meal.

160
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:57,731
[SPEAKER_15]: The way the process will work is I will introduce a person who is going to do the introduction of the inductee.

161
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:07,473
[SPEAKER_15]: The inductee will come up after the introduction, receive a plaque, and give his or her acceptance speech.

162
00:18:08,974 --> 00:18:14,455
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we'll take a picture of the inductee and move on to the next.

163
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:25,836
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that, we'll start our first inductee induction.

164
00:18:26,457 --> 00:18:29,638
[SPEAKER_15]: So John McAdam will be introducing our first inductee.

165
00:18:42,893 --> 00:18:46,336
[SPEAKER_10]: My sincere congratulations to the Mustang Hall of Fame class of 2018.

166
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:50,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Your induction today is an honor that is well-deserved by each of you.

167
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Nathan Clement is our first inductee this afternoon.

168
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:58,707
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a young man who epitomizes three qualities expected of a Hall of Fame.

169
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:02,348
[SPEAKER_10]: excellence in athleticism, leadership, and character.

170
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:05,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Nate's athletic accomplishments are impressive.

171
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:13,052
[SPEAKER_10]: He earned a total of eight letters as a Mustang, four letters in football, two letters in indoor track, and two letters in outdoor track.

172
00:19:13,592 --> 00:19:18,834
[SPEAKER_10]: He was named to the Greater Boston League All-Star teams with all three sports as a junior and senior.

173
00:19:19,395 --> 00:19:28,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Nate was also honored by the Medford Mercury as an All-Star last year, both as a junior and senior, and senior year he was selected as a Harry Adanis All-Star.

174
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:39,757
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition, Nate was the 2013 recipient of both the Edgeling Award, as the Outstanding Senior Male Athlete at Metro High School, and the Feeley Family Award Scholarship.

175
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:50,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Nate's leadership skills and character were clearly evident to his teammates and coaches as he was chosen to captain all three teams this senior year.

176
00:19:51,261 --> 00:19:54,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Head coach Jason Lassamento had this to say about Nate.

177
00:19:54,790 --> 00:20:04,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Nate was instrumental in keeping his class of teammates together during some very difficult times and during a coaching transition that happened midway through his senior year.

178
00:20:05,652 --> 00:20:12,353
[SPEAKER_10]: He was a consistent resource that people could lean on when times were tough, and his teammates looked to him for inspiration.

179
00:20:12,953 --> 00:20:20,535
[SPEAKER_10]: He was part of the glue that kept things afloat and had a long-lasting impact on future generations of athletes at Metcalf High School.

180
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:29,661
[SPEAKER_10]: He always wanted to leave a program better than it was when he came in, and we as coaches are forever grateful that we had the opportunity to coach him.

181
00:20:30,642 --> 00:20:39,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Track coach Tommy Lynch called me, quote, a great, great kid, a great team captain, a great role model, and I was lucky to have coached him.

182
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:46,522
[SPEAKER_10]: In a 2012 midterm transcript article by Chris Hurley, Nate defined his role as the team captain.

183
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:57,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Quote, the role of captain is about leading the way, getting the other athletes in the right mindset, instead of having them feel uncomfortable and nervous before they head into the track for the game.

184
00:20:58,264 --> 00:21:03,906
[SPEAKER_10]: In that article, note Nate was also quoted saying, I'm usually chairing my fellow Mustangs on.

185
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:08,007
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really think it's fair to chair only for your specific team.

186
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,231
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like I have to support every other sport at the high school as well.

187
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:22,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Nate's resume of proven excellence in athleticism, leadership, and character make him a true MHS Hall of Famer, as an athlete and as a person.

188
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:28,316
[SPEAKER_10]: On a personal note, one day after class six years ago, Nate shared two of his goals with me.

189
00:21:29,136 --> 00:21:35,297
[SPEAKER_10]: One was to become a Mustang Hall of Famer, and the other was to become a future Medford High School athletic director.

190
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:47,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Kwame Maloney will be pleased to know that you have made it to the Hall of Fame and relieved to know that you have chosen to pursue a career in physical therapy.

191
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:55,213
[SPEAKER_10]: It is indeed my honor and my great privilege to present our newest member of the Mustang Hall of Fame, Nathan Clement.

192
00:22:36,195 --> 00:22:39,057
[SPEAKER_19]: So first, I'd like to thank Mr. McGadden for the speech.

193
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:43,099
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. McGadden was a huge inspiration to me during my time at Norfolk High.

194
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,821
[SPEAKER_19]: He was one of my biggest supports during my time.

195
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:52,065
[SPEAKER_19]: So first thing, I'd like to thank the Method Hall of Fame for the induction into the class of 2018.

196
00:22:52,825 --> 00:22:56,127
[SPEAKER_19]: It's an incredible honor to be selected and recognized by my fellow peers.

197
00:22:56,147 --> 00:23:02,271
[SPEAKER_19]: And this accomplishment would have never been possible without my family, friends, coaching staff, and teachers.

198
00:23:03,226 --> 00:23:06,767
[SPEAKER_19]: I would like to give a special thank you to my mom and dad back there.

199
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:19,430
[SPEAKER_19]: For always instilling the idea of being the hardest worker possible and that everything else will follow.

200
00:23:19,651 --> 00:23:28,413
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'd also like to give a special thank you to my brother, who's also back there, for introducing the game of football into my life and being my biggest role model for that sport.

201
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:39,200
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to thank Mr. Maloney, Mr. Howard, Ms.

202
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:50,466
[SPEAKER_19]: Bowler, Mr. McGavin once again, Mr. Dempsey for always believing in me, placing me in the best of situations to succeed, making my overall high school athletic experience the best I could possibly be.

203
00:23:52,146 --> 00:23:58,410
[SPEAKER_19]: As well as Coach Lynch and Mr. Richard for pushing me to pursue my career as a track and field.

204
00:23:59,802 --> 00:24:04,986
[SPEAKER_19]: All I ever wanted to do was be the best example of a Mustang teammate and to support everyone around me.

205
00:24:05,286 --> 00:24:08,548
[SPEAKER_19]: And I can truly say I have no regrets on the effort I put towards that goal.

206
00:24:08,888 --> 00:24:09,809
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you and God bless.

207
00:24:25,662 --> 00:24:29,505
[SPEAKER_09]: okay in front of the platform right in front of the podium

208
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:53,843
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, we're just about to get to the real, but a couple quick points here.

209
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:09,172
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, we do have some Mustang Hall of Famers in the room today, in addition to the 14 that will be inducted.

210
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:14,134
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to read all the names, and we'll take your applause.

211
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:16,615
[SPEAKER_15]: When you hear your name, please stand.

212
00:25:16,775 --> 00:25:19,997
[SPEAKER_15]: And if I missed anyone, please wave after I get to the end of the list.

213
00:25:20,877 --> 00:25:30,422
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have with us today Hall of Famers Bill Edgerly, Charlie Pagliarulo, Chuck Andre, David Cresta, Dave Paltari, Ed Finn,

214
00:25:30,902 --> 00:25:33,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anyone else that I can think of?

215
00:25:46,388 --> 00:25:48,789
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't notice coming in, thanks for reaching.

216
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Ron Zampel.

217
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:57,351
[SPEAKER_15]: In addition, some of these folks are longtime members of the All Fame board.

218
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:01,632
[SPEAKER_15]: So they not only were honored, they served to honor others as well.

219
00:26:02,052 --> 00:26:02,692
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

220
00:26:11,394 --> 00:26:14,155
[SPEAKER_15]: And Nick Tucci didn't wave his hand because not only is he

221
00:26:14,697 --> 00:26:23,484
[SPEAKER_15]: He's talented, but he's not as good as he is talented.

222
00:26:23,504 --> 00:26:27,607
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe it's just your time to sleep on Monday, right?

223
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:27,988
[SPEAKER_15]: No?

224
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:29,709
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

225
00:26:34,613 --> 00:26:40,718
[SPEAKER_15]: We also have with us some potential future ball favors where it happens.

226
00:26:42,577 --> 00:26:43,979
[SPEAKER_15]: The captains, where are the captains?

227
00:26:43,999 --> 00:26:49,384
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on, stand up, stand up.

228
00:26:49,745 --> 00:26:56,212
[SPEAKER_15]: We have seven current or just named captains from different high school varsity sports.

229
00:26:56,512 --> 00:26:58,594
[SPEAKER_15]: Six, is someone missing?

230
00:26:59,515 --> 00:27:00,756
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case, the people standing.

231
00:27:10,817 --> 00:27:31,290
[SPEAKER_15]: So hopefully, if you have a winter sport or a spring sport coming up, the stories you tell about seeing this will inspire your teams a little bit more than they might have otherwise.

232
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:37,553
[SPEAKER_15]: But thank you for joining us.

233
00:27:37,694 --> 00:27:38,214
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, now.

234
00:27:40,552 --> 00:27:56,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Now another call of favor, past president and current board member, Coach Joe Barletta will recite our blessing for the week.

235
00:27:59,806 --> 00:28:06,391
[SPEAKER_32]: Dear Lord, we thank you for granting us this wonderful, special day to honor our new inductees.

236
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:09,753
[SPEAKER_32]: As we enter this time of Thanksgiving,

237
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:14,864
[SPEAKER_32]: Let us take pause to remember that all good things come from your bounty.

238
00:28:16,104 --> 00:28:24,728
[SPEAKER_32]: As we share this day in celebration, love, and friendship, let us also remember those members of the Hall of Fame who have passed on.

239
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:30,651
[SPEAKER_32]: We thank you, Lord, for all the blessings, large and small.

240
00:28:31,952 --> 00:28:35,773
[SPEAKER_32]: When I stopped to count them, so many I recalled.

241
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:39,395
[SPEAKER_32]: We thank you for your blessings on our honorees,

242
00:28:40,203 --> 00:28:41,584
[SPEAKER_32]: our families, and our friends.

243
00:28:42,765 --> 00:28:48,189
[SPEAKER_32]: We thank you for watching over us, guiding us, and protecting us from all evil.

244
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:58,377
[SPEAKER_32]: We now ask you, Lord, for your blessings to the food which we are about to receive from your bounty, for those who have prepared it, and for those who will serve it.

245
00:28:58,857 --> 00:29:00,799
[SPEAKER_32]: Through Christ our Lord, amen.

246
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,182
[SPEAKER_32]: The next person to introduce

247
00:29:07,688 --> 00:29:11,331
[SPEAKER_15]: The Hall of Fame conductor will be Sarah Sweat-Sizzle.

248
00:29:19,196 --> 00:29:21,318
Hi everyone.

249
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:30,524
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, I'd like to thank the Hall of Fame committee for putting on another great Sunday afternoon, especially with the fans.

250
00:29:30,544 --> 00:29:33,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I need to do one every two years.

251
00:29:35,823 --> 00:29:37,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations to all the adoptees today.

252
00:29:37,964 --> 00:29:41,665
[SPEAKER_06]: It is quite an honor to be adopted to the Mustang Hall of Fame.

253
00:29:42,105 --> 00:29:46,967
[SPEAKER_06]: As dwarf-y as it sounds, when you walk through the Repertory Halls and see names on the wall, it's a pretty cool feeling.

254
00:29:47,527 --> 00:29:48,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Something you can show your kids.

255
00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:52,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care less about yours than I do about mine.

256
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:56,810
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great honor today to introduce Nicole Bilotto to the Hall of Fame.

257
00:29:57,471 --> 00:29:59,991
[SPEAKER_06]: I first had the pleasure to coach Nicole during soccer.

258
00:30:00,852 --> 00:30:04,433
[SPEAKER_06]: After our first meeting, I had no idea if we were going to loss, what her score was,

259
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:08,351
[SPEAKER_06]: But I remember Jolie being very upset at letting a couple of goals in.

260
00:30:09,132 --> 00:30:12,213
[SPEAKER_06]: She said, well, it's fine, it's the first game you're bowling, you don't let goals in.

261
00:30:13,074 --> 00:30:17,256
[SPEAKER_06]: But I quickly realized that was her intensity and passion that she'll rush at every single game.

262
00:30:17,296 --> 00:30:22,358
And as much as I tried to relax her a little bit, I realized there's no changing that.

263
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:27,401
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I realized she played softball, and I was like, yes, bring the intensity!

264
00:30:28,177 --> 00:30:35,222
[SPEAKER_06]: In all my years coaching or even playing, I had never seen a path that was as intensive as Nicole's, in that five, two, and a half frame.

265
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:38,665
[SPEAKER_06]: She never had to worry she was ready for the game.

266
00:30:38,825 --> 00:30:40,186
[SPEAKER_06]: She thrived in the competition.

267
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:46,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only would I be intimidated to play against Nicole, I would be intimidated about coaching against her.

268
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:49,713
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I think your stuff, Hallie, was pretty intimidating, by the way.

269
00:30:51,874 --> 00:30:52,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Nicole played third base.

270
00:30:53,235 --> 00:30:55,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if anything happened about pass her.

271
00:30:55,337 --> 00:30:57,058
[SPEAKER_06]: She might have dropped a double, but nothing about pass her.

272
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:00,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Third base is an integral position to one conference.

273
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:08,668
[SPEAKER_06]: In the years past, we've had some third basemen who tell us to move in and take a couple of steps, which is totally understandable.

274
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:16,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Coach Schauffele and I decide to move Nicole in and we look over, and then she goes, Nicole, get back, you're going to get killed.

275
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:21,975
[SPEAKER_06]: She could roll her eyes, unmove, and then pick up whatever was hit at her.

276
00:31:23,574 --> 00:31:27,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only was she stellar in the field, she was a complete threat on offense.

277
00:31:27,575 --> 00:31:32,176
[SPEAKER_06]: She had an unbelievable amount of power, 4.16 batting average, 15 home runs, 83 hour yards.

278
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:35,977
[SPEAKER_06]: She had speed, and if you know softball, that's a dangerous combo.

279
00:31:37,017 --> 00:31:42,058
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun to see her play appearances and how she attacked the ball by the fastest hands I've ever seen.

280
00:31:42,758 --> 00:31:45,999
[SPEAKER_06]: But even more fun to see her on the bases and watch the other teams try to get her out.

281
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:51,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Nicole also played basketball, and although I didn't have the chance to coach her in that,

282
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:54,403
[SPEAKER_06]: I can easily picture in my head how she would play the game.

283
00:31:55,284 --> 00:31:58,187
[SPEAKER_06]: She actually bet me freshman year that she would dump my CVM.

284
00:31:59,087 --> 00:32:01,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I told her it would never happen.

285
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Before you tell me, I trust her dreams.

286
00:32:02,891 --> 00:32:06,174
[SPEAKER_06]: When you look at her, you make the same bad as I do.

287
00:32:06,274 --> 00:32:10,017
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I think she still owes me the $500 from that bet.

288
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:13,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Ladies and gentlemen, the ball of laughter.

289
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:38,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be here today or who I am today without some of the kind of high scores.

290
00:32:39,093 --> 00:32:54,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's teaching me patience, whether it's teaching me patience, girl's basketball games the way Bruce is with me again, or teaching me how to never give up when getting pelted with ground ball suppression.

291
00:32:55,506 --> 00:33:03,549
[SPEAKER_02]: from sweat to tarpelling, with them yelling in my face, E5, E5, E5, E5, every single time I would drop or back up.

292
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:14,374
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also, you know, taught me some seriousness as well, which was, you know, an invaluable use of today, or I use it every single day, I don't know.

293
00:33:15,914 --> 00:33:22,217
[SPEAKER_02]: But in all seriousness, I couldn't be more thankful for my experience at record time, and proud to be a Mustang,

294
00:33:22,756 --> 00:33:25,639
[SPEAKER_02]: previously, now, and obviously down to forever.

295
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:33,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to take this moment to thank the Columbine Committee, the board members, all the people involved to make today possible.

296
00:33:34,968 --> 00:33:43,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also like to thank my coaches in attendance, Scarpelli, Sweat, Pats, and Dempsey, and every single coach that I've had in between.

297
00:33:44,096 --> 00:33:48,080
[SPEAKER_02]: You all have played a pivotal role in my life as a person and an athlete.

298
00:33:49,394 --> 00:34:02,078
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the best moments in my career was actually when I received a call, in an email, from the Merrimack College softball team coach, William Schweiger, that I was being asked to attend in the fall and was going to be a member of their softball team.

299
00:34:02,098 --> 00:34:05,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I practically ripped the doorknob of Dempsey's office when I read it.

300
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I didn't really care.

301
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't see anything other than those words on that screen, we want you at Merrimack.

302
00:34:11,822 --> 00:34:12,942
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was pretty cool.

303
00:34:17,718 --> 00:34:20,661
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I would like to give thanks to my family.

304
00:34:21,002 --> 00:34:22,443
[SPEAKER_02]: All of you sitting in the back of your homes.

305
00:34:23,124 --> 00:34:24,525
[SPEAKER_02]: My aunts, my uncles, my cousins, my siblings.

306
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:31,152
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very fitting that we're all here today because they've been here since, you know, the day I started picking up sports.

307
00:34:32,414 --> 00:34:34,877
[SPEAKER_02]: But in particular, I want to thank my mom and my dad.

308
00:34:34,897 --> 00:34:37,820
[SPEAKER_02]: My background in sports for 23 years.

309
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:44,073
[SPEAKER_02]: started at the right age of three when my dad taught me to swim by throwing me in the deep end of the pool.

310
00:34:44,153 --> 00:34:46,735
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll either sink or swim, Terry, and she's fine.

311
00:34:47,115 --> 00:34:52,418
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, because that's exactly how I, you know, that's what I do, I'm intense.

312
00:34:52,779 --> 00:34:57,482
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I played, and that's how I became successful, and I've now obviously used that for the rest of my life.

313
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:02,365
But again, neither are safe, thrown or swim, and you have to pick either of those.

314
00:35:07,432 --> 00:35:13,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your support, your sacrifice, your travel, your practices, your love.

315
00:35:13,202 --> 00:35:16,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Even when I told you how much I sucked that day.

316
00:35:17,236 --> 00:35:23,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have gone, you know, 4 for 5, or get two home runs, but I don't know if you worry about the strikeout that I have.

317
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:30,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Not once have you guys ever questioned how good a person I was, or trying to partner through every single challenge that I was faced with.

318
00:35:31,805 --> 00:35:34,087
[SPEAKER_02]: So, to you guys, I thank you for your sacrifice.

319
00:35:34,147 --> 00:35:35,928
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are the reason why I'm here today.

320
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:39,070
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being honored for such great things that you're doing every day.

321
00:35:40,455 --> 00:35:40,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And now my sister.

322
00:35:41,035 --> 00:35:45,717
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you that don't know, we are actually going to be four siblings inducted together.

323
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:47,497
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll hear from her later today.

324
00:35:48,197 --> 00:35:51,298
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to thank you for always pushing me for stuff.

325
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:53,859
I think, you know, meeting other sisters is not always fun.

326
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:59,020
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to kind of, you know, share a little light, I got the call first that I was going to be inducted.

327
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:01,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Then she got the call the second day.

328
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:07,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I was super happy for her, and it's not only for her sister, but in truly cool fashion,

329
00:36:08,123 --> 00:36:11,634
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course though, I'm still the better actress.

330
00:36:14,122 --> 00:36:14,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure at all.

331
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:17,283
[SPEAKER_02]: She is the reason why I am also here.

332
00:36:17,323 --> 00:36:25,104
[SPEAKER_02]: She was my best friend, always pushing me to become more competitive, do better than her, see her grow as an awesome athlete at her own rate.

333
00:36:25,324 --> 00:36:28,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And that has been really cool to see, and it's really cool that I can also share this with her.

334
00:36:29,585 --> 00:36:32,486
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fitting that she's a freshman, I'm a senior.

335
00:36:33,086 --> 00:36:42,608
[SPEAKER_02]: We then went to different colleges, so it's nice that we can kind of come together once again and share in this one-time sports stature as siblings and best friends.

336
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,281
[SPEAKER_02]: So to cap this all off, again, thank you to everybody here.

337
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:49,361
Congrats to all the other inductees.

338
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:58,443
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am very proud and fortunate to be a part of such a unique group of people and athletes, and they're all white.

339
00:36:58,823 --> 00:37:02,564
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very happy to be, you know, blue and white for my babies forever.

340
00:37:02,984 --> 00:37:05,005
And I'm now happy to say that that's true.

341
00:37:05,485 --> 00:37:06,845
So thank you all very much.

342
00:37:19,014 --> 00:37:23,547
[SPEAKER_22]: Right in front of the public.

343
00:38:04,355 --> 00:38:11,777
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm the shortest and least athletic of the three Walter brothers.

344
00:38:12,817 --> 00:38:23,060
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel really privileged to be here tonight with you all to introduce someone I've been lucky to know as a teammate, classmate, and most importantly as a brother.

345
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,742
[SPEAKER_21]: Ben Walter himself finished athletics here at Medford High.

346
00:38:28,423 --> 00:38:34,066
[SPEAKER_21]: He later had a successful college career and later turned into a professional career out at the Colorado Rockies.

347
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:41,410
[SPEAKER_21]: Ben didn't only have incredible success on the field, but also impacted the lives of many folks off the field.

348
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:50,535
[SPEAKER_21]: I won't go too much into his athletic accomplishments as I feel he'll speak for himself, but I think we can talk a little bit more about who Ben is as a person.

349
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:03,846
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you know you were leading the Boston League and bad before leading the Ohio Valley Conference in home run?

350
00:39:03,866 --> 00:39:08,970
[SPEAKER_21]: He would always kind of joke and say, I don't look at the stats, they kind of get in my head.

351
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,092
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think he, or I always did that.

352
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:23,363
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think he understood the bigger picture of that win came from the ability to work together as a team and also the time that he spent not just bettering himself, but bettering those around him as well.

353
00:39:30,837 --> 00:39:34,960
[SPEAKER_21]: integrity, and the care support projects that he does for himself.

354
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,741
[SPEAKER_21]: A few examples.

355
00:39:38,182 --> 00:39:43,165
[SPEAKER_21]: Ben had eight varsity letters while playing at Medford High his senior year when he was captain of the baseball team.

356
00:39:44,306 --> 00:39:49,729
[SPEAKER_21]: Under his leadership, he brought the team back to stay turned for many times, from the first time in many years.

357
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:56,813
[SPEAKER_21]: But I feel that shouldn't really overshadow the work he did volunteering at the Home Area Club for Bill and Uncle Kev, and he's a Bill.

358
00:39:58,034 --> 00:40:05,398
[SPEAKER_21]: Another example, that was sort of the country for home runs when he was in college was NCAA Division I baseball.

359
00:40:05,998 --> 00:40:08,539
[SPEAKER_21]: But even more powerful than his home run was swim, I think.

360
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:17,764
[SPEAKER_21]: I recall one night after a game he sat up top in the dugout and shook his head with several children that were suffering from childhood leukemia.

361
00:40:18,244 --> 00:40:19,985
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think, you know,

362
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:40,811
[SPEAKER_21]: And then again, in addition to being able to hit wherever he's played for baseball, he's also spent time out there with his fans and children to sign autographs and take pictures.

363
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:45,014
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think while we're people, sometimes we head back to the clubhouse and crack a beer.

364
00:40:45,034 --> 00:40:49,838
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if there's anything wrong with that, but he always spent time to give back.

365
00:40:55,495 --> 00:41:07,920
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll say one last thing, I think I speak for most people that come out of this program, that one thing I always learned, that I always learned from the program was that you're a gentleman and then you're an athlete and a gentleman comes first.

366
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:15,923
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think, I've always embraced that quite a lot then, it's a very successful athletic career, allowing you to touch the lives of more people.

367
00:41:16,623 --> 00:41:18,386
[SPEAKER_21]: You have to imagine the special children.

368
00:41:20,529 --> 00:41:24,976
[SPEAKER_21]: So I wanted to thank the selection committee and congratulate them on being inducted into the Hall of Fame.

369
00:41:24,997 --> 00:41:25,918
[SPEAKER_21]: So let's hear it for them.

370
00:42:02,299 --> 00:42:09,142
[SPEAKER_20]: First of all, thank you to Dave Crowley and the board for setting up this whole ceremony and inducting me, as well as all the other people here.

371
00:42:10,563 --> 00:42:12,344
[SPEAKER_20]: Several people I'd like to thank, first of all.

372
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:14,966
[SPEAKER_20]: First, George Scarpelli.

373
00:42:15,546 --> 00:42:16,807
[SPEAKER_20]: Many of you probably know George.

374
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,388
[SPEAKER_20]: He was my elementary school gym teacher.

375
00:42:21,889 --> 00:42:25,030
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, we kind of found my love for athletics and sports.

376
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:29,230
[SPEAKER_20]: I think when I was in the 4th grade, I hit a home run.

377
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:33,051
[SPEAKER_20]: He still owes me a bucket of slush.

378
00:42:33,091 --> 00:42:36,932
[SPEAKER_20]: Nick Tucci and Paul Matitoff, two of my coaches throughout my high school career.

379
00:42:36,952 --> 00:42:40,413
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys, you know, were the first ones to believe in me.

380
00:42:40,453 --> 00:42:43,913
[SPEAKER_20]: Coach Matitoff put me on the team as a sophomore.

381
00:42:43,933 --> 00:42:47,914
[SPEAKER_20]: Now I'm on the senior team, so thank you for having faith in me.

382
00:42:48,547 --> 00:42:51,470
[SPEAKER_20]: Coach Gucci, thank you for carrying on after Coach Mattapell left.

383
00:42:53,393 --> 00:43:02,703
[SPEAKER_20]: Ron Tampel, thank you to Ron for all the hard work he put in over the years for myself and all the other athletes.

384
00:43:04,045 --> 00:43:04,966
[SPEAKER_20]: It didn't go unnoticed.

385
00:43:05,594 --> 00:43:11,336
[SPEAKER_20]: I had many athletic directors over the years and you're one of my favorites, so thank you for all that.

386
00:43:12,116 --> 00:43:16,437
[SPEAKER_20]: Then the Finns, Ed and Sandra Finn, I saw you guys when I pulled up.

387
00:43:16,457 --> 00:43:17,757
[SPEAKER_20]: I was thinking of you yesterday.

388
00:43:17,777 --> 00:43:23,359
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys, I'm sure you played a huge part in setting this up as well as over the years.

389
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:29,501
[SPEAKER_20]: All you did for myself and the other athletes with the football team, Hall of Fame, banquets, everything.

390
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:33,465
[SPEAKER_20]: premier character in that, so thank you for your time with that.

391
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:47,223
[SPEAKER_20]: Paul Guleva, now the headmaster, he was my fifth period chemistry teacher, and we had a misfit class, so I think we turned him into the headmaster, so thanks for putting up with us.

392
00:43:49,863 --> 00:43:53,686
[SPEAKER_20]: So, thank you everybody else for coming out, I appreciate the support.

393
00:43:54,546 --> 00:43:57,669
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Pagliarulo too, I didn't get to say thank you to you.

394
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:00,331
[SPEAKER_20]: You've been a true batting practice to me all the years.

395
00:44:01,111 --> 00:44:04,974
[SPEAKER_20]: Charlie, one of my teammates, so thank you to the Pagliarulo family.

396
00:44:05,615 --> 00:44:10,678
[SPEAKER_20]: And that kind of goes to kick things off with why I'm here when I was in high school.

397
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:15,622
[SPEAKER_20]: Many of you know if you've been there, the Hall of Fame plaques are right outside the gymnasium.

398
00:44:16,435 --> 00:44:21,036
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'd often walk through the Hall of Fame plaques, look at them, like I did with my mom Boquette.

399
00:44:21,596 --> 00:44:22,597
[SPEAKER_20]: They attended Medford High.

400
00:44:22,637 --> 00:44:24,557
[SPEAKER_20]: They're also members of the Hall of Fame.

401
00:44:25,337 --> 00:44:28,878
[SPEAKER_20]: So at a young age, I kind of wanted to compete with them.

402
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:33,139
[SPEAKER_20]: And hopefully one day, you know, set goals for myself and get my name up there.

403
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:37,120
[SPEAKER_20]: So a lot of attributions to them as well.

404
00:44:37,821 --> 00:44:40,021
[SPEAKER_20]: Then getting into my family.

405
00:44:40,701 --> 00:44:42,682
[SPEAKER_20]: Throughout the years, I've missed countless holidays.

406
00:44:44,009 --> 00:44:46,550
[SPEAKER_20]: my mother's birthday, Mother's Day, you name it.

407
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:48,390
[SPEAKER_20]: I wasn't there for a lot of that.

408
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:59,914
[SPEAKER_20]: All the people in my inner circle, they know the sacrifices that I went through over the years to make it to the level I played at, so thank you all for hanging with me along the way.

409
00:45:02,535 --> 00:45:05,236
[SPEAKER_20]: Mom, she's back there taking a picture now.

410
00:45:08,274 --> 00:45:14,200
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to say thank you for all the support, sacrifices, long nights listening and watching my games over the years.

411
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,322
[SPEAKER_20]: You've always been one of my best fans.

412
00:45:16,342 --> 00:45:20,025
[SPEAKER_20]: I grew up in a single-parent household.

413
00:45:20,045 --> 00:45:21,927
[SPEAKER_20]: I know it's hard for you to raise us.

414
00:45:23,568 --> 00:45:29,171
[SPEAKER_20]: One of the funny stories with my mom on Mother's Day, we wanted to go down to the park, hit that in practice.

415
00:45:30,572 --> 00:45:31,972
[SPEAKER_20]: We dragged her out on Mother's Day.

416
00:45:31,992 --> 00:45:33,333
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it was the third or fourth pitch.

417
00:45:33,373 --> 00:45:34,354
[SPEAKER_20]: We didn't have an L screen.

418
00:45:34,374 --> 00:45:35,774
[SPEAKER_20]: I hit a line drive off her shin.

419
00:45:38,216 --> 00:45:39,776
[SPEAKER_20]: That ended her Mother's Day.

420
00:45:39,836 --> 00:45:44,719
[SPEAKER_20]: So that kind of goes to show you a little bit about the person she is and why we're all here today.

421
00:45:44,759 --> 00:45:47,800
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you for everything you've done, Mom.

422
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:52,583
[SPEAKER_20]: My grandmother, she's not here today, but she helped raise us along with my mother.

423
00:45:54,644 --> 00:45:56,946
[SPEAKER_20]: My father, he's still in Arkansas.

424
00:45:56,986 --> 00:45:59,428
[SPEAKER_20]: He put in a lot of time on the farm.

425
00:45:59,448 --> 00:46:02,130
[SPEAKER_20]: He taught me about sacrifice, hard work, and dedication.

426
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:06,613
[SPEAKER_20]: So he's a lot to thank for the reason I am where I am today.

427
00:46:06,713 --> 00:46:11,297
[SPEAKER_20]: And then both my brothers, Matt and Andrew, you guys have been my practice partners the whole way.

428
00:46:12,918 --> 00:46:15,940
[SPEAKER_20]: So thanks for putting up with me, my mouth, and my attitude all those years.

429
00:46:19,887 --> 00:46:23,048
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'd also like to thank all my teammates over the years and my coaches.

430
00:46:23,528 --> 00:46:25,329
[SPEAKER_20]: None of this would have been possible without you.

431
00:46:26,709 --> 00:46:28,650
[SPEAKER_20]: Since leaving Medford High, I've played at St.

432
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:38,133
[SPEAKER_20]: Anselm College, Cypress College, Jacksonville State, the North Shore Navigators, Orleans Firebirds, Atlanta Braves, Kansas City Royals, Colorado Rockies, and Gateway Prisoners.

433
00:46:39,486 --> 00:46:46,888
[SPEAKER_20]: Every time I pulled on a different jersey, I realized I represented those organizations as well as my family and the city of Medford that I came from.

434
00:46:47,628 --> 00:46:52,329
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I hope I did a good job representing everybody and thank you all for the support over the years.

435
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:59,851
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a quote I like about baseball, it's a funny game, parallels life in many ways.

436
00:47:01,438 --> 00:47:04,581
[SPEAKER_20]: The game gets harder and more competitive the older you get.

437
00:47:05,241 --> 00:47:07,083
[SPEAKER_20]: Pitching mound moves harder from home plate.

438
00:47:07,363 --> 00:47:09,165
[SPEAKER_20]: Bases move harder away from each other.

439
00:47:10,025 --> 00:47:13,468
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to learn to become more independent and make the right decisions in the game.

440
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:17,311
[SPEAKER_20]: A strong baseball player can have a bad and good days on the field.

441
00:47:18,072 --> 00:47:21,054
[SPEAKER_20]: They may strike out a few times, but they don't hang their head.

442
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:23,717
[SPEAKER_20]: Instead, they try again the next time.

443
00:47:24,197 --> 00:47:25,978
[SPEAKER_20]: They practice and get better at the game.

444
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:29,962
[SPEAKER_20]: They listen to advice coaches give them, and they go out swinging.

445
00:47:30,805 --> 00:47:33,066
[SPEAKER_20]: If they get a lucky swing, they might come all the way home.

446
00:47:33,746 --> 00:47:36,648
[SPEAKER_20]: A strong baseball player may not always have the lucky swing.

447
00:47:37,268 --> 00:47:40,189
[SPEAKER_20]: They may hit the ball, but it was an easy out in the center fielder's glove.

448
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:45,552
[SPEAKER_20]: Sometimes they make bad decisions, and when they get to the next base, the pitcher picks them off.

449
00:47:46,532 --> 00:47:55,736
[SPEAKER_20]: When a strong player goes back to his teammates in the dugout and knows how to be a good teammate, they must work hard to get the home plate, learn from their mistakes, and pay attention to the game.

450
00:47:56,397 --> 00:47:58,818
[SPEAKER_20]: They must never take their eye off the ball or the goal.

451
00:47:59,705 --> 00:48:02,127
[SPEAKER_20]: In life, we must all try to be strong baseball players.

452
00:48:04,508 --> 00:48:11,273
[SPEAKER_20]: Finally, I'd like to thank all of my host families over the years who opened their homes to me and treated me like I was part of their own family.

453
00:48:11,573 --> 00:48:20,560
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to thank my fans who followed me every step of the way, every city, every hometown, and every ballpark, from Missoula, Montana, to Tampa, Florida, and everywhere in between.

454
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:29,854
[SPEAKER_20]: You'll never know the joy of the evening seeing the fans and kids wear my jersey or number and appreciate how good of a player I was for the person I was off the field.

455
00:48:30,832 --> 00:48:33,813
[SPEAKER_20]: There are a number of people who helped me out along the way and shaped my career.

456
00:48:34,653 --> 00:48:36,693
[SPEAKER_20]: Barry Rosen, who was my first coach at St.

457
00:48:37,193 --> 00:48:38,794
[SPEAKER_20]: Anselm College.

458
00:48:39,054 --> 00:48:42,215
[SPEAKER_20]: He took a shot at me when no one else would and gave me a chance to play.

459
00:48:44,835 --> 00:48:48,196
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter Galani, he was the general manager with the North Shore Navigators.

460
00:48:48,956 --> 00:48:50,757
[SPEAKER_20]: He gave me a chance when no one else would either.

461
00:48:53,177 --> 00:48:59,120
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's a lot of other people that I could sit here and talk about, but I'd like to just thank those people, thank everyone in the room.

462
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:03,802
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'd just like to close it out with a quote from Jim Comey.

463
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:11,485
[SPEAKER_20]: He talked about it all things, a mix of current and past athletes as well.

464
00:49:11,505 --> 00:49:16,448
[SPEAKER_20]: And he gave a piece this past year where he said to every kid, take it one moment at a time.

465
00:49:17,428 --> 00:49:19,209
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't sail too high or sink too low.

466
00:49:19,909 --> 00:49:21,330
[SPEAKER_20]: Learn to be good at handling failure.

467
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:25,191
[SPEAKER_20]: Be the first one to the ballpark, be the last one to leave.

468
00:49:25,892 --> 00:49:27,412
[SPEAKER_20]: Work hard and don't complain.

469
00:49:28,193 --> 00:49:31,134
[SPEAKER_20]: Be a great teammate and ask other people about themselves.

470
00:49:31,514 --> 00:49:32,875
[SPEAKER_20]: You never know what you might learn.

471
00:49:33,535 --> 00:49:35,316
[SPEAKER_20]: And above all, treat people with respect.

472
00:49:36,616 --> 00:49:40,438
[SPEAKER_20]: The best compliment any baseball player can receive is that he's a good teammate.

473
00:49:41,238 --> 00:49:44,780
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a reflection of all the things not listed on the back of a baseball card.

474
00:49:45,518 --> 00:49:51,682
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the focus, the attitude, the openness, and the way an individual picks you up on Monday but will call you out on Tuesday.

475
00:49:52,542 --> 00:49:55,964
[SPEAKER_20]: In short, it's about accountability, reliability, and commitment.

476
00:49:56,905 --> 00:50:01,368
[SPEAKER_20]: Baseball is all about family, and I'm so glad to celebrate this great day with those voices tonight.

477
00:50:01,988 --> 00:50:05,830
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you to the city of Medford and all of you who have given me and supported me throughout the years.

478
00:50:20,352 --> 00:50:20,532
Thank you.

479
00:50:39,505 --> 00:50:40,145
The great, great, great man, right?

480
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:40,566
Godfrey will be here.

481
00:50:40,586 --> 00:50:40,746
And Phil.

482
00:51:12,218 --> 00:51:26,635
[SPEAKER_17]: On behalf of the Board of Directors of the Francis Reinhardt Aquarium and Jeanne Mack Gym, I'm very pleased to introduce the next inductee, Godfrey Trevallyan, Medford High School Class of 1906.

483
00:51:28,966 --> 00:51:33,929
[SPEAKER_17]: which I believe is the earliest class to be represented in this prestigious hall.

484
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:45,417
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much to the Mustang Hall of Fame for considering all the athletes that have performed through the entire history of Benton High School.

485
00:51:46,758 --> 00:51:50,861
[SPEAKER_17]: Godfrey Chevalier's distinguished career in the U.S.

486
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,482
[SPEAKER_17]: Navy and his service

487
00:51:53,177 --> 00:52:03,721
[SPEAKER_17]: is what is most commonly known about him in the community, and why the city of Medford named its new high school auditorium in his honor in 1940.

488
00:52:03,821 --> 00:52:16,505
[SPEAKER_17]: As a 21-year-old midshipman, should I single-handedly rescue 16 fellow sailors who have been dumped from a barge into the icy waters of the Hudson River?

489
00:52:17,837 --> 00:52:23,738
[SPEAKER_17]: Later, during World War I, he was a decorated commanding officer of US forces in France.

490
00:52:24,598 --> 00:52:37,221
[SPEAKER_17]: And in 1922, he performed his best-known feat, becoming the first American aviator to both take off from and land a plane on a moving ship.

491
00:52:38,381 --> 00:52:46,323
[SPEAKER_17]: But it was actually as an athlete in Medford High School where Shabali first demonstrated the strength

492
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:52,287
[SPEAKER_17]: courage and gallantry that would mark his military career.

493
00:52:53,269 --> 00:52:59,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Inch for inch and pound for pound, few athletes could compare with Chevalier in his day.

494
00:53:00,792 --> 00:53:21,827
[SPEAKER_17]: Standing just five feet, five inches, and weighing not even 125 pounds, Chevalier possessed an unusual combination of strength, speed, and stamina that he used to excel at Bedford High in three sports, track, crew, and hockey.

495
00:53:22,848 --> 00:53:28,692
[SPEAKER_17]: This goes to show you that student athletes of any size can excel if they are determined to.

496
00:53:29,877 --> 00:53:36,119
[SPEAKER_17]: The Boston Globe described Chevalier as one of the best athletes for his age that ever attended Medford High School.

497
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:46,543
[SPEAKER_17]: Captain of the Mustang Indoor Track Team and also the crew team, Chevalier also demonstrated a winning character.

498
00:53:47,632 --> 00:53:56,814
[SPEAKER_17]: Back in the days of Shiragi's career, a lot of the time, meat statistics, all-star teams, a lot of those things just weren't invoked back then.

499
00:53:56,874 --> 00:54:10,497
[SPEAKER_17]: But time after time, the articles would talk about his performance where he would anchor the relay team, be the third runner, and the team was behind, and it was Godfrey Shiragi's performance that brought the team back.

500
00:54:11,353 --> 00:54:18,376
[SPEAKER_17]: allowed it to prevail, but typically he would never allow those accolades to come his way.

501
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:27,820
[SPEAKER_17]: The Method Mercury wrote, his modesty and his willingness to allow his teammates to assume full glory for his personal feats

502
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:38,124
[SPEAKER_17]: Not only won for him the captaincy of the school crew, but irrevocably endeared him in the hearts of his rivals and his idols.

503
00:54:38,584 --> 00:54:43,126
[SPEAKER_17]: I think he would be equally humbled to accept an award of this nature today.

504
00:54:44,286 --> 00:54:51,249
[SPEAKER_17]: As I mentioned, in 1940, the medicine, the Chevalier Auditorium, was dedicated in his honor, and the Medford Citizen wrote,

505
00:54:51,823 --> 00:55:00,709
[SPEAKER_17]: that it extolled and held up to the youth of the city, Godfrey Chevalier as an example of gallantry and courage.

506
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:15,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Now nearly 80 years later, Godfrey Chevalier's induction into the Medford Mustang Hall of Fame offers similar inspiration for the Medford High athletes of both today and years to come.

507
00:55:16,743 --> 00:55:33,414
[SPEAKER_17]: Accepting the award on behalf of Godfrey Chevalier is Phil Chevalier, great-grandson of Godfrey's brother, John B. Chevalier, who also is a Medford Eye grad and World War I aviator, and great-grandnephew

508
00:55:44,587 --> 00:55:48,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for the applause, because I didn't do anything.

509
00:55:50,709 --> 00:55:57,130
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd really like to thank Ken for being really a champion of Godfrey's legacy up here.

510
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:58,471
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually didn't grow up in the area.

511
00:55:58,551 --> 00:56:01,111
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in Northern Virginia.

512
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:09,854
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved up here for work reasons a couple years ago, and I've since gotten involved in what Ken's doing a little bit, and seeing it firsthand.

513
00:56:09,894 --> 00:56:11,474
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's truly remarkable.

514
00:56:11,934 --> 00:56:19,140
[SPEAKER_01]: to see that somebody that I am related to in the distant past made such a mark on a community.

515
00:56:19,581 --> 00:56:23,764
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only just any community, what I'm seeing here today is one that is so...

516
00:56:28,689 --> 00:56:33,571
[SPEAKER_01]: but one that is so intact and so vibrant.

517
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:46,796
[SPEAKER_01]: And seeing it today is really a testament to the fact that I don't think anyone would have been able to do what he did without coming from a community and a support system that looks like this one, especially so many years later.

518
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:54,199
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much for the award and for inducting Godfrey and for keeping his name alive.

519
00:56:54,379 --> 00:56:55,519
[SPEAKER_01]: My family really appreciates it.

520
00:56:55,539 --> 00:56:56,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

521
00:57:18,576 --> 00:57:24,098
Thank you.

522
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:35,102
[SPEAKER_15]: The next person introducing Nenakti is Niko Karen.

523
00:57:45,639 --> 00:57:46,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Good afternoon.

524
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:54,226
[SPEAKER_09]: For those of you who don't know Tia, she was an athlete all four years through high school for three different teams, volleyball, swimming, and lacrosse.

525
00:57:55,707 --> 00:58:02,912
[SPEAKER_09]: When she was on these teams, she was a captain of the volleyball and lacrosse team her junior and senior years, and a captain of the swim team her senior year.

526
00:58:02,932 --> 00:58:05,935
[SPEAKER_09]: I was fortunate enough to serve with her on the swim team.

527
00:58:06,295 --> 00:58:07,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Couldn't ask for a better captain at the time.

528
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:10,058
[SPEAKER_09]: The way she played motivated us all to love her.

529
00:58:10,418 --> 00:58:14,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Our coach, Mary Judge, said she never saw anything like the advantage she became under my dad and me.

530
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:25,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Tia was a GVL All-Star in both volleyball and lacrosse for her junior and senior years, and for swimming all four of her years at Medford High.

531
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:34,960
[SPEAKER_09]: While on the subject of GVLs, Tia earned four medals at the GVL Swimming Championship with first and second place finishes in the 50 Freestyle and 100 Freestyle.

532
00:58:38,038 --> 00:58:51,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Upon leaving MFI, she earned quite a few various awards, the M-Club Captain Award, the Mustang Club Mustang Pride Award as a student athlete, and of course, the Girls Lacrosse Coaches Award.

533
00:58:52,744 --> 00:58:54,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Her career ended in high school.

534
00:58:54,905 --> 00:58:59,407
[SPEAKER_09]: She continued with some of the same incidents, where she played girls lacrosse and some

535
00:59:03,542 --> 00:59:11,605
[SPEAKER_09]: When she was there, the Northeast Conference awarded her the Player of the Week for 10 goals in her final week at St.

536
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:11,905
[SPEAKER_09]: David's.

537
00:59:13,845 --> 00:59:18,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Due to this, the Women's Lacrosse also gave her the National Honor Roll Award.

538
00:59:19,747 --> 00:59:22,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Despite all this, she never forgot her roots.

539
00:59:22,828 --> 00:59:27,089
[SPEAKER_09]: In 2011, she came back to Northern I to coach the JV lacrosse team for one year.

540
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:29,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hear it for her, guys.

541
00:59:43,042 --> 00:59:58,089
[SPEAKER_12]: So my brother likes to public speak, so when he had this opportunity, he was eager to jump on it.

542
00:59:58,169 --> 00:59:59,630
[SPEAKER_12]: I, on the other hand, do not.

543
01:00:00,788 --> 01:00:02,909
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pretty brief in trying to get through it without passing out.

544
01:00:04,089 --> 01:00:05,989
[SPEAKER_12]: I absolutely, absolutely loved high school.

545
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:07,350
[SPEAKER_12]: I did well.

546
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,511
[SPEAKER_12]: In school, I had good grades, but what I really loved the most was sports.

547
01:00:11,311 --> 01:00:14,512
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to take the time to just thank all of the coaches that I had throughout the years.

548
01:00:14,632 --> 01:00:19,153
[SPEAKER_12]: I had some of our teams, the coaches switched throughout the year, so it's a long list.

549
01:00:19,193 --> 01:00:20,774
[SPEAKER_12]: So here we go.

550
01:00:20,894 --> 01:00:29,516
[SPEAKER_12]: Coach Garcia, Coach Dyer, Coach Judge, Coach Forty, Coach Laws, Coach Pelosi, Big Mac, Coach Leah, and Coach Virgilio.

551
01:00:30,532 --> 01:00:41,876
[SPEAKER_12]: I had some of the best times playing with you all, and I appreciate all the time that you put into coaching me, and the time that you've dedicated to the teams and making us better people on and off the field.

552
01:00:42,576 --> 01:00:49,799
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank Mr. Z for, Ron Zampel, for nominating me for this award and this honor.

553
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:57,222
[SPEAKER_12]: It's amazing to be considered a part of this group and this issue for a few short minutes since I'm talking here.

554
01:00:59,147 --> 01:01:03,351
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also want to thank my family, so especially my parents for their love and support.

555
01:01:04,092 --> 01:01:05,413
[SPEAKER_12]: I grew up a tomboy.

556
01:01:05,513 --> 01:01:09,557
[SPEAKER_12]: I was always out in the schoolyard or at the park playing sports, especially with my dad.

557
01:01:09,577 --> 01:01:14,963
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, Mom, I'm going to pick up a little bit more of my athletic ability from Dad.

558
01:01:15,863 --> 01:01:26,467
[SPEAKER_12]: She is going to kill me, but my mom has been known to roll an ankle walking down the sidewalk, but when she walks in Greece, she definitely makes up for it in heart.

559
01:01:27,327 --> 01:01:35,810
[SPEAKER_12]: She is a mom that's always in the stands, never missed a game, always dropping off and picking up for practices, not me, but my brother and my sister as well.

560
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:42,632
[SPEAKER_12]: She was the team mom for all of my teams, always bringing oranges for halftime, hosting team events at our house.

561
01:01:43,537 --> 01:01:45,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's the crazy lady yelling on the sidelines?

562
01:01:45,638 --> 01:01:45,998
[SPEAKER_12]: My mom.

563
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:52,321
[SPEAKER_12]: And as much as we like to give her a hard time, I wouldn't be here without her, so thanks, mom.

564
01:01:52,581 --> 01:01:54,803
[SPEAKER_12]: You're the real MVP.

565
01:01:54,823 --> 01:02:00,485
[SPEAKER_12]: To all of the members of the Mustang Hall of Fame, I am so flattered to be joining your ranks.

566
01:02:01,266 --> 01:02:06,728
[SPEAKER_12]: It truly is an honor to be able to call myself a member of such an amazing group of people.

567
01:02:07,389 --> 01:02:09,730
[SPEAKER_12]: And congrats to all of the other inductees tonight.

568
01:02:59,028 --> 01:02:59,928
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Ms.

569
01:02:59,988 --> 01:03:00,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Crow.

570
01:03:00,869 --> 01:03:07,831
[SPEAKER_16]: Before I get started in this induction, I just want to make sure everybody understands and give them a round of applause.

571
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:13,853
[SPEAKER_16]: With every induction today, we give a common theme, and how great the parents are.

572
01:03:14,053 --> 01:03:18,274
[SPEAKER_16]: And I see a lot of my former athletes that are here tonight that are being inducted.

573
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:19,275
[SPEAKER_16]: It makes me so proud.

574
01:03:19,655 --> 01:03:22,176
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think we all owe our parents a round of applause.

575
01:03:22,216 --> 01:03:23,596
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank them for everything they do.

576
01:03:31,469 --> 01:03:33,910
[SPEAKER_16]: So, a few things I need to point out.

577
01:03:35,811 --> 01:03:50,677
[SPEAKER_16]: It is amazing when you look at the names of Karen, and Faggiano, and Lopilato, and Andre, and Waldron, and the common theme is how great physical education teaches can make an impact in a kid's life.

578
01:03:52,835 --> 01:03:57,016
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for giving me that opportunity.

579
01:03:57,316 --> 01:04:02,818
[SPEAKER_16]: And Ben, that bucket of slush I did deliver, the Crasco family did steal it.

580
01:04:03,078 --> 01:04:04,578
[SPEAKER_16]: That did happen.

581
01:04:04,678 --> 01:04:08,319
[SPEAKER_16]: Another thing I'd like to point out tonight is Coach Sweat is wearing pink.

582
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:16,862
[SPEAKER_16]: For those people that know Coach Sweat, if you ever showed up to a softball practice with pink cleats or pink gloves,

583
01:04:23,027 --> 01:04:29,291
[SPEAKER_16]: The common theme was always that we're coaching athletes and it's made a huge difference.

584
01:04:29,331 --> 01:04:35,474
[SPEAKER_16]: So I want to thank all of our student-athletes being inducted today.

585
01:04:35,514 --> 01:04:45,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Something that, for me as now an alumni and a member of this honorable committee, I will tell you if you walk into any Dunkin' Donuts in Medford for $2.20,

586
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:48,457
[SPEAKER_16]: You can get a medium, regular.

587
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:52,599
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all about turning up in Hall of Fame, so it's very important.

588
01:04:53,399 --> 01:04:57,100
[SPEAKER_16]: Last thing you'll notice, I'm wearing Mrs. Andre's glasses because I forgot them.

589
01:04:57,981 --> 01:05:01,402
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm not embarrassed to do this.

590
01:05:01,782 --> 01:05:04,803
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't see anybody in front of me, so this is great.

591
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:17,546
[SPEAKER_16]: It's my honor and privilege today to talk and call out one of my favorite student-athletes ever to come to high school.

592
01:05:17,566 --> 01:05:19,387
[SPEAKER_16]: Kyle Andre, class of 2007.

593
01:05:19,947 --> 01:05:21,788
[SPEAKER_16]: Cross-country, four letters, co-captain.

594
01:05:22,449 --> 01:05:30,314
[SPEAKER_16]: Basketball, four letters, a guard, GBL All-Star, three-time co-captain, several 20-point games as a senior.

595
01:05:31,074 --> 01:05:35,437
[SPEAKER_16]: Softball, four letters, outfield, co-captain, GBL All-Star, junior.

596
01:05:35,977 --> 01:05:36,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Total letters, 12.

597
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:45,053
[SPEAKER_16]: She was awarded the Friends of Angel Torres, a great honor for our Mustang athletes.

598
01:05:45,673 --> 01:05:53,538
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I have the privilege and the honor of being a head coach of multiple sports at Medford High School.

599
01:05:55,139 --> 01:06:02,964
[SPEAKER_16]: Having this opportunity is one of the best opportunities of my life in announcing one of my all-time favorite Mustang athletes.

600
01:06:03,809 --> 01:06:10,333
[SPEAKER_16]: It makes me super proud that Kyla's situation as a Mustang softball player came with many ups, but a lot more downs.

601
01:06:10,853 --> 01:06:18,358
[SPEAKER_16]: As a freshman in softball, Kyla not only made our varsity team, but started in the center field and was one of the GBL's best lead-up hitters.

602
01:06:19,219 --> 01:06:24,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Kyla led the team in stolen bases her sophomore year, and both seasons was top three in batting average.

603
01:06:25,102 --> 01:06:30,526
[SPEAKER_16]: She was named to the GBL All-Star team her sophomore year, and her talent was shooting toward greatness.

604
01:06:31,643 --> 01:06:34,964
[SPEAKER_16]: Kyla Erdovasi lived all four years a Mustang softball player.

605
01:06:36,185 --> 01:06:37,825
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me tell you about her downs.

606
01:06:38,385 --> 01:06:56,111
[SPEAKER_16]: In my opinion, Kyla was headed in the direction of being known as Medford High School's one of the greatest players until the end of her junior and senior basketball seasons, when both ended with Kyla tearing her ACLs in both knees, which put her on crutches for two final softball seasons.

607
01:06:56,912 --> 01:07:01,133
[SPEAKER_16]: That's when her downs brought her to what I believe is true greatness, in my opinion.

608
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:07,764
[SPEAKER_16]: Knowing Kyla could not play her last two seasons, she never missed a game or a practice.

609
01:07:08,505 --> 01:07:16,071
[SPEAKER_16]: Kyla was named captain her senior year, and Kyla was an honor roll student who dedicated herself to medical.

610
01:07:16,891 --> 01:07:22,636
[SPEAKER_16]: She would come to practice as soon as practice was over, she'd run off to therapy, never making her softball team second.

611
01:07:23,257 --> 01:07:28,339
[SPEAKER_16]: While doing that, Kyla still maintained a daunting academic schedule, earning honors every year.

612
01:07:29,059 --> 01:07:34,341
[SPEAKER_16]: One question that has been asked was, how does Kyla receive a varsity letter while she is injured?

613
01:07:35,122 --> 01:07:35,942
[SPEAKER_16]: My answer is simple.

614
01:07:36,762 --> 01:07:40,864
[SPEAKER_16]: Kyla earned the right to finish both seasons on the field as a varsity player.

615
01:07:40,884 --> 01:07:51,268
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember talking with that trainer and asking permission that Kyla could have the opportunity to lip off the center field position and record one inning to make her eligible

616
01:07:51,715 --> 01:07:54,516
[SPEAKER_16]: for those well-earned varsity letters, and that's what she did.

617
01:07:54,536 --> 01:08:08,323
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember the crowd as one of my proudest coaching moments, was announcing Kyle's name on senior day, and watching him bow to her number, was painted in center field, and that, in my mind, was a true example of what a true Mustang looks like.

618
01:08:09,623 --> 01:08:10,624
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm so proud tonight.

619
01:08:13,895 --> 01:08:23,458
[SPEAKER_16]: to announce a captain and an athlete that I think has done one of the most admirable, moved on to one of the most admirable positions as a teacher.

620
01:08:23,498 --> 01:08:27,439
[SPEAKER_16]: As a coach, you want to teach your student athletes to be the best they can be.

621
01:08:28,059 --> 01:08:36,721
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm proud that Kyla has taken those thoughts and that attitude, and now she's probably one of the best special education teachers in Medford High School.

622
01:08:37,182 --> 01:08:40,563
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm so honored that she's doing that.

623
01:08:40,643 --> 01:08:41,643
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's as a coach,

624
01:08:42,543 --> 01:08:50,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Something that Mr. Matatal and we talked about when we were coaching together is making those student-athletes into great people.

625
01:08:51,348 --> 01:08:53,409
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've only said this to one other athlete, but...

626
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:02,399
[SPEAKER_16]: I had a son, and when I would talk about Claire, I knew C.J.

627
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:06,983
[SPEAKER_16]: Gard is someone that I've always simulated my son to be one day, one of my former student-athletes.

628
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:12,988
[SPEAKER_16]: My daughter, Gianna, someday could be like Alejandra and be the happiest father in the world.

629
01:09:13,068 --> 01:09:18,753
[SPEAKER_16]: So, ultimately, I congratulate her, and welcome to the class of 2018 Method Mustang Hall of Fame.

630
01:09:43,695 --> 01:09:49,857
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd first like to thank the Hall of Fame Board of Directors for considering and selecting me to be part of this prestigious honor.

631
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:53,018
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Coach Del Pelle, for my introduction.

632
01:09:53,858 --> 01:10:00,021
[SPEAKER_26]: Coach and I go way back to the medical recreation days, where I learned my very first surgery at the age of nine.

633
01:10:00,441 --> 01:10:07,183
[SPEAKER_26]: So aside from my family, he's truly been part of my entire medical career, every step and mid-step of the way.

634
01:10:08,307 --> 01:10:22,198
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you to my support system of family and friends for here celebrating this event with me today, including my mom and dad, and especially Kirk Vitello, who dedicated hours of his time each weekend to practice shooting three throws of clean in the gym.

635
01:10:23,459 --> 01:10:28,963
[SPEAKER_26]: I get to stand alongside the size of no earthly athlete that have passed through the Mesa High hallways.

636
01:10:30,024 --> 01:10:35,548
[SPEAKER_26]: An Olympian, a Boston Marathon director, every athlete and coach being honored here today,

637
01:10:36,715 --> 01:10:40,877
[SPEAKER_26]: But most importantly, I get to stand alongside my father, Chuck Albright.

638
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:45,080
[SPEAKER_26]: My dad is responsible for my passion and knowledge of sport.

639
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,681
[SPEAKER_26]: It is he who I get my confidence from.

640
01:10:48,241 --> 01:10:50,002
[SPEAKER_26]: It is he who I get my jump shot from.

641
01:10:51,003 --> 01:10:59,487
[SPEAKER_26]: And when my world was torn not once but twice by a crushing knee injury, it was he who believed that pursuing an NCAA basketball career was still possible.

642
01:11:00,068 --> 01:11:01,589
[SPEAKER_26]: And I went on to play in a manual college.

643
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:11,898
[SPEAKER_26]: I imagine what my father spoke about is 1995's Hall of Fame induction, and I know without a doubt he made a very important person who was there then, though he's not here today.

644
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:24,409
[SPEAKER_26]: My grandfather's reign, who never missed a game I played in, was the driving force behind my competitiveness, which drew my determination to keep my athletic career afloat after two significant knee surgeries.

645
01:11:24,429 --> 01:11:26,310
[SPEAKER_26]: I celebrate this honor in his memory.

646
01:11:27,645 --> 01:11:30,867
[SPEAKER_26]: I am especially thankful today that my sword did not end in injury.

647
01:11:31,408 --> 01:11:42,215
[SPEAKER_26]: I owe gratitude to those who taught me to be relentless and gave me the courage to believe that the sneeze would play basketball again and even one day cross the Boston Marathon finish line.

648
01:11:42,255 --> 01:11:43,516
[SPEAKER_26]: My love for Bedford is evident.

649
01:11:43,896 --> 01:11:50,221
[SPEAKER_26]: Though I no longer live in the city, I returned to pursue a teaching career in special education at my high school.

650
01:11:50,241 --> 01:11:55,825
[SPEAKER_26]: I became part of the girls' basketball coaching staff, so I'm privileged to have Mustang basketball relevant in my life every day.

651
01:11:57,684 --> 01:12:06,293
[SPEAKER_26]: To have my Metro High School athletic career forever create into a community that I'm so deeply invested in is both rewarding and humbling.

652
01:12:06,373 --> 01:12:15,282
[SPEAKER_26]: I hope to follow in the coaching footsteps of both Coach Scarpelli and my father, and to someday have the honor of presenting a Hall of Fame award to one of my players after a successful season.

653
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:58,127
[SPEAKER_15]: The next introduction will be made by Coach Joe Carlin.

654
01:13:16,657 --> 01:13:20,818
[SPEAKER_32]: First, I would like to congratulate all the new inductees to the Hall of Fame.

655
01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:34,704
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope that this is not your final step to the Hall of Fame, but I hope it's the beginning of your being an active supporter and participant in the Mustang Hall of Fame in the future.

656
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,165
[SPEAKER_32]: We'd love to have you.

657
01:13:37,909 --> 01:13:40,691
[SPEAKER_32]: I now have the honor of presenting our next inductee.

658
01:13:42,072 --> 01:13:50,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I have been told to be brief, but unfortunately that's not one of my attributes.

659
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:52,181
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will try.

660
01:13:53,682 --> 01:14:00,388
[SPEAKER_32]: At the end of the Christmas season, one of our traditions is the giving and receiving of gifts.

661
01:14:01,589 --> 01:14:05,152
[SPEAKER_32]: As a coach, it is rewarding to receive a gift

662
01:14:06,069 --> 01:14:12,934
[SPEAKER_32]: not only an outstanding, talented player, but also a person of high character and a perfect gentleman.

663
01:14:15,055 --> 01:14:16,637
[SPEAKER_32]: But how do we measure success?

664
01:14:19,579 --> 01:14:23,862
[SPEAKER_32]: How do we recognize someone as a Hall of Fame?

665
01:14:25,383 --> 01:14:32,348
[SPEAKER_32]: I think of that beautiful, present, attractive Raffens looking at it,

666
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:39,824
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that those wrappings represent all the statistics that we use to measure success.

667
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:42,306
[SPEAKER_32]: How many goals scored?

668
01:14:43,026 --> 01:14:44,027
[SPEAKER_32]: How many home runs?

669
01:14:44,447 --> 01:14:45,148
[SPEAKER_32]: How many hits?

670
01:14:45,428 --> 01:14:46,769
[SPEAKER_32]: How many points scored?

671
01:14:46,809 --> 01:14:48,090
[SPEAKER_32]: How fast did we run?

672
01:14:50,932 --> 01:14:54,434
[SPEAKER_32]: These are all important and well-earned.

673
01:14:56,015 --> 01:15:02,640
[SPEAKER_32]: I will not use my brief time to enumerate the rewards and accomplishments of our inductee,

674
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:11,652
[SPEAKER_32]: that were produced on the playing field because those were all read inside the program.

675
01:15:15,413 --> 01:15:21,194
[SPEAKER_32]: What is inside that box that we are unable to see?

676
01:15:21,394 --> 01:15:26,236
[SPEAKER_32]: What is the measure of the value of that gift inside that box?

677
01:15:26,796 --> 01:15:31,057
[SPEAKER_32]: These are the intangibles, the statistics not seen in the box book.

678
01:15:32,497 --> 01:15:41,624
[SPEAKER_32]: To me, the most important accomplishment of a player is when you ask yourselves, how much better did he make the players around him?

679
01:15:43,366 --> 01:15:49,730
[SPEAKER_32]: Needless to say, he gained the confidence of his teammates and inspired his line mates to greater heights.

680
01:15:51,052 --> 01:16:01,780
[SPEAKER_32]: His dedication to his team, his quiet leadership, outstanding sportsmanship on and off the field, and his inspiration playing through injury

681
01:16:02,318 --> 01:16:04,480
[SPEAKER_32]: is what makes him a Mustang Hall of Fame.

682
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:14,507
[SPEAKER_32]: So in closing, it's most important to what is inside the box, and not just the wrappings that we see on the outside.

683
01:16:17,108 --> 01:16:21,632
[SPEAKER_32]: Credit to his family, his community, and Medford High School.

684
01:16:22,532 --> 01:16:27,636
[SPEAKER_32]: He gives true meaning to the phrase, once a Mustang, always a Mustang.

685
01:16:29,077 --> 01:16:30,318
[SPEAKER_32]: It is now my pleasure

686
01:16:31,422 --> 01:16:41,431
[SPEAKER_32]: and a great honor that I proudly present to you a new inductee to the Mustang Hall of Fame, Konstantinos Charly Kastanidis.

687
01:17:03,115 --> 01:17:13,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I promise I'm gonna make it short and sweet, and I'm gonna speak from the heart.

688
01:17:13,985 --> 01:17:18,349
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't make up a speech, so whatever comes out, it's right from the bottom of my heart.

689
01:17:18,369 --> 01:17:26,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanna thank Coach Barletta for believing in me, trusting me.

690
01:17:28,565 --> 01:17:37,688
[SPEAKER_05]: For everything we've been through, from our soccer days, our ups and downs, it was the most unbelievable ride that we had for two years.

691
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:44,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Coach John McAdams, I want to thank you personally for helping me on the field.

692
01:17:46,764 --> 01:17:49,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I came in 1985 from Greece.

693
01:17:50,126 --> 01:17:53,488
[SPEAKER_05]: The second day I was here, my dad took me to Medford High School.

694
01:17:54,629 --> 01:17:57,852
[SPEAKER_05]: My father is no longer with me now, so it's kind of emotional for me.

695
01:17:59,613 --> 01:18:05,477
[SPEAKER_05]: He introduced me to Coach Balletter, and he told me that this is your new soccer team.

696
01:18:06,177 --> 01:18:10,641
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first practice I went to the high school, I came back home and I said to my dad,

697
01:18:12,358 --> 01:18:18,119
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not just a soccer team, this is going to be part of my family.

698
01:18:18,139 --> 01:18:27,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank the committee, all the directors for inducting me into the Hall of Fame.

699
01:18:27,701 --> 01:18:33,082
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great honor and privilege for me to be here with all the Mustang inductees.

700
01:18:36,266 --> 01:18:42,673
[SPEAKER_05]: My teammates, I want to thank my teammate, friend, neighbor, motivator, Joe Scabelli.

701
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:49,059
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's one person who motivates you and pumps you up, you're looking at Joe Scabelli.

702
01:18:54,485 --> 01:18:56,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Always pushed me, just like my coaches.

703
01:18:58,102 --> 01:18:59,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Joe and John.

704
01:19:00,543 --> 01:19:04,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, my other teammate is here, Dave Rimmer.

705
01:19:04,165 --> 01:19:10,468
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank Dave for scoring that winning goal that won the championship in Arlington, the last game of the season.

706
01:19:11,309 --> 01:19:12,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave, thank you.

707
01:19:18,112 --> 01:19:19,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just say,

708
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:25,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank my family, my mom, for being there, pushing me, encouraging me.

709
01:19:25,895 --> 01:19:28,118
[SPEAKER_05]: My sister, my uncle, they never missed a game.

710
01:19:28,338 --> 01:19:29,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for supporting me.

711
01:19:30,801 --> 01:19:35,006
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was one or two goals, they always told me you need to score more.

712
01:19:35,026 --> 01:19:36,247
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I never got the end of it.

713
01:19:39,691 --> 01:19:44,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Another person that I want to give a special thanks is to my ESL high school teacher.

714
01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:48,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank her personally for teaching me how to speak English.

715
01:19:48,915 --> 01:19:56,178
[SPEAKER_05]: He was my ESL teacher and I want to thank her for helping with my homework and always being there for me.

716
01:19:56,198 --> 01:19:56,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

717
01:20:04,363 --> 01:20:09,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank you always for three lessons you taught us on the field and off the field.

718
01:20:10,427 --> 01:20:13,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one was always you had to be a gentleman.

719
01:20:13,729 --> 01:20:14,829
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to be a good person.

720
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:18,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two was always do your homework.

721
01:20:19,032 --> 01:20:23,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember him checking all the quizzes and tests and all your subjects.

722
01:20:23,494 --> 01:20:25,396
[SPEAKER_05]: If you were not doing good, you weren't on the field.

723
01:20:26,016 --> 01:20:28,898
[SPEAKER_05]: And the number three rule that coach had was

724
01:20:29,999 --> 01:20:33,968
[SPEAKER_05]: If you aren't talented enough, he will make you talented with hard work and fear.

725
01:20:34,249 --> 01:20:34,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Coach.

726
01:20:43,334 --> 01:20:46,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations to all the Mustangs that have been inducted today.

727
01:20:48,156 --> 01:20:49,256
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a big family.

728
01:20:49,476 --> 01:20:50,676
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the city of Medford.

729
01:20:50,696 --> 01:20:52,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I love playing for the Mustangs.

730
01:20:53,077 --> 01:20:56,338
[SPEAKER_05]: And like the coach said, once a Mustang, you'll always be a Mustang.

731
01:20:56,918 --> 01:21:00,700
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm so glad that I called Medford home when I came from Greece.

732
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:01,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

733
01:21:28,117 --> 01:21:30,379
Thank you, Coach.

734
01:21:52,903 --> 01:21:54,626
Okay, next, the next introduction will be from Kurt A. Pogar.

735
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:30,884
[SPEAKER_14]: First of all, I would like to thank the Mustang Hall of Fame committee.

736
01:22:31,585 --> 01:22:36,825
[SPEAKER_14]: I happen to be on the first committee of the Mustang Hall of Fame.

737
01:22:36,905 --> 01:22:50,388
[SPEAKER_14]: I know how much time and effort you put into the task of going about choosing the young athletes, and in some cases older athletes, that are inducted into the Hall of Fame.

738
01:22:50,428 --> 01:22:51,508
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you very much.

739
01:22:55,473 --> 01:23:08,138
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel very blessed and fortunate to have grown up in Medford and played in sports in Medford, Medford High School.

740
01:23:08,519 --> 01:23:11,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Added to that, I was fortunate to

741
01:23:12,621 --> 01:23:24,871
[SPEAKER_14]: not only teach, but coach at Medford High School, and many memories that will never be forgotten as far as I'm concerned.

742
01:23:25,412 --> 01:23:26,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Now let's ask him.

743
01:23:27,974 --> 01:23:34,599
[SPEAKER_14]: As most observers of baseball know, it is driven by statistics.

744
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:39,343
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a pleasant experience yesterday morning.

745
01:23:40,804 --> 01:23:41,465
[SPEAKER_14]: I went back.

746
01:23:42,252 --> 01:23:51,038
[SPEAKER_14]: and pulled out my score books from the EI school, 1981 through 1984.

747
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:55,061
[SPEAKER_14]: They were great years for several reasons.

748
01:23:56,622 --> 01:24:03,426
[SPEAKER_14]: Great talent, great enthusiasm for the game, great success on the field.

749
01:24:05,968 --> 01:24:10,231
[SPEAKER_14]: Steve Mayhear was a big part of all of it.

750
01:24:10,271 --> 01:24:10,331
[SPEAKER_14]: In 1981,

751
01:24:12,263 --> 01:24:17,666
[SPEAKER_14]: As a freshman, it was a huge reason why the team only lost one game.

752
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:25,251
[SPEAKER_14]: When Fred Knox retired, I became the varsity coach the next year.

753
01:24:26,211 --> 01:24:31,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Steve was one of only three sophomores to make the varsity team.

754
01:24:31,975 --> 01:24:37,958
[SPEAKER_14]: The other two were Mustang Hall of Famers, Warren Olsen, and David Delfino.

755
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:48,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Steve became the starting center fielder during his junior year and played every game over his final two years.

756
01:24:50,507 --> 01:24:57,830
[SPEAKER_14]: He was on the 1983 team that had a regular season record of 20-0 and the 84 team that finished 16-4.

757
01:24:57,930 --> 01:24:59,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Steve hit the ball hard.

758
01:25:06,409 --> 01:25:10,730
[SPEAKER_14]: He was a slashing, line-drive hitter with occasional power.

759
01:25:12,351 --> 01:25:13,631
[SPEAKER_14]: He seldom struck out.

760
01:25:13,651 --> 01:25:17,592
[SPEAKER_14]: He could be counted on to put the ball in play.

761
01:25:19,633 --> 01:25:22,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Between 1983 and 1984, he averaged .378 with three homers, 12 doubles, seven triples, and 37 RBIs.

762
01:25:23,654 --> 01:25:24,214
[SPEAKER_14]: He even pitched

763
01:25:36,413 --> 01:25:37,374
[SPEAKER_14]: when needed.

764
01:25:40,516 --> 01:25:45,380
[SPEAKER_14]: What the scorebook doesn't tell you is the other assets he brought to the game.

765
01:25:46,661 --> 01:25:50,725
[SPEAKER_14]: His speed and his gracefulness in the field.

766
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:58,531
[SPEAKER_14]: His defensive skills and his accurate, strong, over-the-top throwing.

767
01:26:00,693 --> 01:26:03,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Add to these things, Steve had a strong

768
01:26:08,253 --> 01:26:10,435
[SPEAKER_14]: to be the best he could be.

769
01:26:12,336 --> 01:26:18,761
[SPEAKER_14]: These are the reasons that Steve Mayhear is being inducted into the Mustang Hall of Fame tonight.

770
01:26:20,343 --> 01:26:29,050
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm so pleased to see him here with his entire family, along with Hall of Fame team manager Brian Branson.

771
01:26:30,915 --> 01:26:38,005
[SPEAKER_14]: I also know that my assistant coach, Paul Matatal, is very pleased with Steve's induction.

772
01:26:39,787 --> 01:26:44,274
[SPEAKER_14]: It is an honor for me to present Steve Napier, Mustang Hall of Fame.

773
01:27:09,553 --> 01:27:15,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dave, and thank you to the Public Faith Committee for this wonderful recognition today.

774
01:27:19,037 --> 01:27:19,877
[SPEAKER_13]: It's interesting.

775
01:27:20,217 --> 01:27:35,923
[SPEAKER_13]: I speak in front of large groups all the time as a financial advisor, and I have no trouble with the thought of talking to you about the things that I know about my business and the things that I can teach people.

776
01:27:37,695 --> 01:27:40,838
[SPEAKER_13]: I was talking to my good friend Hank Morris, who couldn't be here today.

777
01:27:41,499 --> 01:27:45,983
[SPEAKER_13]: He's somewhat heartbroken over it, but he had a number of commitments.

778
01:27:46,824 --> 01:27:55,853
[SPEAKER_13]: And I said, it's awfully difficult to think about talking about yourself and what you accomplished.

779
01:27:56,153 --> 01:27:57,875
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just generally not my style.

780
01:27:58,908 --> 01:28:06,439
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that being said, I just wanted to spend some time to thank some folks, certainly the Hall of Fame committee.

781
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:13,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Truly honored and grateful to be here today to celebrate with my family and friends, all the other inductees.

782
01:28:14,437 --> 01:28:15,578
[SPEAKER_13]: and their friends and family.

783
01:28:15,638 --> 01:28:26,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Many folks here I know, I've been in, my family's been in the Medford community for just nearly a hundred years, so to be here with all of you folks is just a great honor.

784
01:28:26,946 --> 01:28:31,009
[SPEAKER_13]: And to be part of the whole thing, a family, is truly an honor and a privilege.

785
01:28:33,001 --> 01:28:43,605
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a pleasant surprise, if not a shock, to hear from David Crowley when he formally let me know that I was receiving this honor.

786
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:58,070
[SPEAKER_13]: It was several years when I bumped into Hall of Famer now, Bud Kelly, and Bud, in his typical fashion, said, Steve, you need to give the Hall of Fame.

787
01:29:01,657 --> 01:29:04,020
[SPEAKER_13]: And he said, no, you've got to call me on Monday.

788
01:29:04,861 --> 01:29:09,147
[SPEAKER_13]: I called him on Monday, and he got me going in the process.

789
01:29:09,167 --> 01:29:16,056
[SPEAKER_13]: And as soon as I hung up the phone, I called Dave Bocari, whom I'm really thankful for, and he helped me figure out

790
01:29:25,204 --> 01:29:37,229
[SPEAKER_13]: So, interestingly enough, the last time I received an award at the Irish American Club was, I'm giving away my age, and you can tell by my gray hair, was 1978.

791
01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:46,613
[SPEAKER_13]: I received an award from the Wellington Blend of the Middle League, which doesn't exist anymore.

792
01:29:46,633 --> 01:29:47,353
[SPEAKER_13]: Imagine that.

793
01:29:47,513 --> 01:29:51,035
[SPEAKER_13]: We used to have four Little Leagues here, but now we're down to one.

794
01:29:52,265 --> 01:30:01,548
[SPEAKER_13]: And back then, I went up to receive my reward and a little trophy and got a handshake from Bill Campbell, the leader from the Red Sox.

795
01:30:02,548 --> 01:30:08,329
[SPEAKER_13]: How far have we come today where the Red Sox used to actually attend banquets?

796
01:30:09,190 --> 01:30:09,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway...

797
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:24,993
[SPEAKER_13]: My introduction to baseball basketball came from my father who, I think at the age of six, he put my brother Scott's glove on my left hand and he threw me the ball and I caught it.

798
01:30:25,873 --> 01:30:30,875
[SPEAKER_13]: And I took the glove off and I threw it back to my left hand and he called me a softball.

799
01:30:31,215 --> 01:30:35,876
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was a little upset because I didn't know what that meant but generally I guess that means you're a lefty.

800
01:30:36,476 --> 01:30:40,897
[SPEAKER_13]: And from there on in I realized I was left handed and baseball was my game.

801
01:30:42,598 --> 01:30:53,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Like many of you, I spent most of my time not just in school and doing homework, but on the ball fields, in the gym, playing sports.

802
01:30:54,045 --> 01:30:59,368
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Medford community allowed for so many opportunities for kids to play sports.

803
01:30:59,408 --> 01:31:05,873
[SPEAKER_13]: We had Park League in the summer, CYO basketball, youth programs at Medford High, the Little

804
01:31:10,784 --> 01:31:15,509
[SPEAKER_13]: of the 70s and 80s, my good friend Charlie can attest to this.

805
01:31:17,110 --> 01:31:27,439
[SPEAKER_13]: We actually went down to the park, unorganized pick up games, where we picked the teams, we made the rules, and we officiated the games on our own.

806
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:35,367
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was a great sporting experience by being involved in that end of it, as well as the organized aspects of sports.

807
01:31:36,351 --> 01:31:44,938
[SPEAKER_13]: So, all of this culminated in leading me and helping me to achieve my goal of becoming an entered Mustang.

808
01:31:45,838 --> 01:31:52,583
[SPEAKER_13]: Back in 1978, when the football team won the Super Bowl, everybody wanted to be a Mustang man.

809
01:31:52,644 --> 01:31:53,304
[SPEAKER_13]: It was great.

810
01:31:54,265 --> 01:32:03,131
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was very fortunate to be, at this time, introduced and influenced by Mustang Hall of Fame coaches, Dave Capari,

811
01:32:04,392 --> 01:32:13,974
[SPEAKER_13]: and Paul Malatov, who honestly helped build me up, give me confidence, and become the best player I can be.

812
01:32:14,054 --> 01:32:20,976
[SPEAKER_13]: And I owe lots of them to them.

813
01:32:25,337 --> 01:32:29,018
[SPEAKER_13]: So, for having both of you as my coaches,

814
01:32:30,339 --> 01:32:35,982
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm truly grateful and want to personally thank you for what you did for me and many of my teammates.

815
01:32:36,443 --> 01:32:37,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks you guys.

816
01:32:38,964 --> 01:32:49,630
[SPEAKER_13]: I should also mention my other coaches, Angel Torres, Jack O'Brien, they coached me in basketball and also guided me in a very similar fashion.

817
01:32:51,170 --> 01:33:03,354
[SPEAKER_13]: It was also a very exciting time to be a Mustang, and the early 80s Metro teams were extremely competitive, and particularly in baseball we were, as Dave mentioned, a powerhouse.

818
01:33:04,935 --> 01:33:08,536
[SPEAKER_13]: I had the great fortune of being on the 83 team that went undefeated with almost a

819
01:33:17,286 --> 01:33:21,164
[SPEAKER_13]: may very well be one of the best lineups that have ever existed.

820
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:38,726
[SPEAKER_13]: I often sometimes run into former teammates and reminisce about those great days and how much fun it was and how dominant they were.

821
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:41,268
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just truly a blast.

822
01:33:41,948 --> 01:33:42,889
[SPEAKER_13]: We had fun too.

823
01:33:43,389 --> 01:33:46,552
[SPEAKER_13]: So Hank Morris was a member of the 83-84 teams.

824
01:33:47,232 --> 01:33:51,755
[SPEAKER_13]: I think he had a yellow Volkswagen bus with curtains in the windows.

825
01:33:52,876 --> 01:33:55,218
[SPEAKER_13]: And our friend Steve McCormick used

826
01:34:02,358 --> 01:34:12,262
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, and then, it was the time that we had to, so Steve McCormick brought the project, so we probably wouldn't let him out with just anyone.

827
01:34:12,342 --> 01:34:24,006
[SPEAKER_13]: So, he used to put on his uniform, because his mom thought he had a baseball game, and Hank and I would go pick him up, and then he'd change out of his uniform, and then we'd go out.

828
01:34:24,227 --> 01:34:27,368
[SPEAKER_13]: So, we had a lot of good times with him.

829
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:34,571
[SPEAKER_13]: But, for most of all, I would be remorseful if I did not provide thanks to my family.

830
01:34:35,812 --> 01:34:39,054
[SPEAKER_13]: My mom, Peggy, a.k.a.

831
01:34:39,254 --> 01:34:42,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Ma Peg, is here, right over there.

832
01:34:42,676 --> 01:34:45,397
[SPEAKER_13]: You can barely see her around my gigantic brother.

833
01:34:47,378 --> 01:34:50,860
[SPEAKER_13]: She, along with my dad, were a great influence on my success.

834
01:34:51,421 --> 01:34:52,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ma Peg.

835
01:34:53,842 --> 01:34:55,403
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, my brothers Ed, Jeff,

836
01:34:56,356 --> 01:35:03,861
[SPEAKER_13]: We kept my head in check when it got a little too big, and we're also at the same time our biggest fans.

837
01:35:04,621 --> 01:35:21,552
[SPEAKER_13]: My brother Scott, who unfortunately passed away, I used to, he was the oldest, he was the only kid I knew who could hit bongos like a man, and I used to make my father make him take me down to the field and hit me

838
01:35:29,498 --> 01:35:31,660
[SPEAKER_13]: So God bless you, Scott.

839
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:35,963
[SPEAKER_13]: We're thinking about you today.

840
01:35:36,583 --> 01:35:42,067
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, my best friend, Hank Morse, was also a member of the 83 team, as I mentioned.

841
01:35:42,187 --> 01:35:48,932
[SPEAKER_13]: And also my good friend, Jonah Callahan, is here today, who is a true friend and an influence in my life in this very day.

842
01:35:50,394 --> 01:35:57,620
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank my wife, Susan, for still letting me play baseball and other sports today.

843
01:35:58,381 --> 01:36:00,122
[SPEAKER_13]: She calls me her third child.

844
01:36:00,863 --> 01:36:08,750
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to also thank her for not leaving me in high school and becoming a district attorney.

845
01:36:10,625 --> 01:36:22,276
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to thank my kids, Katie and Sean, for becoming wonderful young adults and truly great human beings, which is what I'm most proud of.

846
01:36:23,757 --> 01:36:30,224
[SPEAKER_13]: So, in closing, I'm thrilled to be part of, well, I forgot one thing.

847
01:36:31,104 --> 01:36:33,126
[SPEAKER_13]: Tia, you mentioned your mom and her ankle.

848
01:36:33,787 --> 01:36:35,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Now that we're part of the same community,

849
01:36:37,422 --> 01:36:42,243
[SPEAKER_13]: to my wife because she rolls her ankle and she sneezes.

850
01:36:42,303 --> 01:36:52,306
[SPEAKER_13]: So in closing, I'd like to say it's truly an honor to be part of the Medford High School Hall of Fame.

851
01:36:53,206 --> 01:36:59,948
[SPEAKER_13]: I've always felt very strongly about my past history and being involved in Medford sports.

852
01:37:00,688 --> 01:37:04,429
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a Medford resident to this day, and I want to thank you all

853
01:37:16,148 --> 01:37:16,328
Thank you.

854
01:37:16,348 --> 01:37:17,309
Next introduction will be from Charlie and Peggy.

855
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:50,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Ladies and gentlemen...

856
01:38:03,145 --> 01:38:05,926
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, I want to thank the committee for their due diligence.

857
01:38:06,166 --> 01:38:07,987
[SPEAKER_11]: They're an incredible group of people.

858
01:38:08,107 --> 01:38:13,170
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if I can be on that committee, but you really are.

859
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:18,673
[SPEAKER_11]: You deserve a lot of credit, and a lot of times people don't know what they're doing behind the scenes.

860
01:38:19,213 --> 01:38:20,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, thanks for my help, by the way.

861
01:38:20,794 --> 01:38:22,434
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a man of the staff.

862
01:38:22,454 --> 01:38:23,015
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm great.

863
01:38:24,215 --> 01:38:27,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Now to get to the man of the hour here.

864
01:38:27,937 --> 01:38:29,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Typical of Jack Debsie.

865
01:38:30,278 --> 01:38:31,379
[SPEAKER_11]: He came in late today.

866
01:38:32,612 --> 01:38:33,632
[SPEAKER_11]: was on induction.

867
01:38:33,772 --> 01:38:34,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

868
01:38:34,252 --> 01:38:45,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Because he was in Westfield, Massachusetts at the state championship cross-country for his med school, Arlington Catholic.

869
01:38:46,695 --> 01:38:50,255
[SPEAKER_11]: And he called me up Wednesday and he said, Charlie, you're not going to believe this.

870
01:38:50,295 --> 01:38:51,355
[SPEAKER_11]: They changed the date.

871
01:38:52,516 --> 01:38:52,916
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

872
01:38:53,676 --> 01:38:54,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we got through it.

873
01:38:55,056 --> 01:38:56,976
[SPEAKER_11]: And here he came in at about 2.30.

874
01:38:57,777 --> 01:39:00,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably, you know, nobody can stand him.

875
01:39:01,346 --> 01:39:06,130
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to get in here, otherwise I'm thankful that he's here.

876
01:39:06,890 --> 01:39:10,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Coach Mattafall, who was a great coach in his own right.

877
01:39:10,753 --> 01:39:11,654
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll know him as well.

878
01:39:11,814 --> 01:39:12,655
[SPEAKER_11]: I love him.

879
01:39:12,915 --> 01:39:15,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Volkari, Mr. Valedo Morani.

880
01:39:16,978 --> 01:39:17,919
[SPEAKER_21]: There you go.

881
01:39:17,959 --> 01:39:18,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Great coaches.

882
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:24,564
[SPEAKER_11]: He once said to me, by the way, I took it to heart, if you want to be rich, don't be a coach.

883
01:39:26,666 --> 01:39:27,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know what?

884
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:35,494
[SPEAKER_11]: He's the richest person I know.

885
01:39:36,855 --> 01:39:37,656
[SPEAKER_11]: He truly is.

886
01:39:39,076 --> 01:39:45,720
[SPEAKER_11]: I know this because I'm with him, by his side, every day, even in the off-season.

887
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:46,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Even in the off-season.

888
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:54,324
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't even go by strict here because it's just too much to talk about a relative that you love dearly.

889
01:39:55,484 --> 01:39:57,105
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'll continue here if I will.

890
01:39:57,125 --> 01:39:58,066
[SPEAKER_11]: I need my glasses.

891
01:39:58,166 --> 01:39:59,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Steven, you need my glasses too.

892
01:40:00,287 --> 01:40:00,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

893
01:40:01,167 --> 01:40:02,348
[SPEAKER_11]: This is how we'll go together.

894
01:40:03,214 --> 01:40:12,663
[SPEAKER_11]: So 10 years ago, Uncle Jack calls me up, and this is the one and only time he said the word, I, in a sentence.

895
01:40:13,684 --> 01:40:19,749
[SPEAKER_11]: And he says, hey, Roderick, I just got the job, and you're coaching with me.

896
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:21,271
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

897
01:40:21,471 --> 01:40:21,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

898
01:40:21,991 --> 01:40:22,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

899
01:40:23,332 --> 01:40:26,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody who knows my background, I had nothing to do with pro sports ever.

900
01:40:26,756 --> 01:40:28,077
[SPEAKER_11]: I never even saw an event.

901
01:40:28,938 --> 01:40:30,019
[SPEAKER_11]: What a lesson I got.

902
01:40:30,079 --> 01:40:33,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, young Jackie, by the way, who's in the audience today.

903
01:40:34,301 --> 01:40:35,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Huge role.

904
01:40:35,541 --> 01:40:38,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Huge role.

905
01:40:38,923 --> 01:40:41,985
[SPEAKER_11]: So he would use the word we, they, and us.

906
01:40:42,185 --> 01:40:44,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Typically, we have to help these kids.

907
01:40:45,186 --> 01:40:45,747
[SPEAKER_11]: They need us.

908
01:40:45,767 --> 01:40:46,787
[SPEAKER_11]: We need them.

909
01:40:48,348 --> 01:40:50,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's say they want to have BP.

910
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:54,671
[SPEAKER_11]: They need a water gun fight at Columbus Park.

911
01:40:54,811 --> 01:40:57,193
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're going to fight us.

912
01:40:59,239 --> 01:41:04,423
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, if you notice in the program, ladies and gentlemen, you'll see dear Coach Jemsey.

913
01:41:06,986 --> 01:41:08,067
[SPEAKER_11]: That was not made up.

914
01:41:09,988 --> 01:41:10,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Girls, where are you?

915
01:41:10,609 --> 01:41:11,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you please stand up?

916
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:14,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Right there at that table, our scene is right now.

917
01:41:14,752 --> 01:41:17,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Please stand up and be called.

918
01:41:17,595 --> 01:41:22,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Stay there for one second.

919
01:41:22,319 --> 01:41:25,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Alumna and Katie, I saw you in the audience today.

920
01:41:27,643 --> 01:41:36,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Alumni, let's go, stand up.

921
01:41:39,412 --> 01:41:47,298
[SPEAKER_11]: That, by the way, what you see right in front of you, okay, it's like this.

922
01:41:47,878 --> 01:41:55,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Jack has had the responsibility all these years to put these young ladies, and I'll take that quote from Nick,

923
01:41:56,325 --> 01:41:58,106
[SPEAKER_11]: in a position to succeed.

924
01:41:58,486 --> 01:42:04,028
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't mean shortstop, I don't mean center field.

925
01:42:04,488 --> 01:42:05,909
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean to succeed in life.

926
01:42:07,409 --> 01:42:08,750
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he's done a great job.

927
01:42:09,370 --> 01:42:10,830
[SPEAKER_11]: That's his responsibility.

928
01:42:10,890 --> 01:42:15,232
[SPEAKER_11]: And by the way, today ladies, all of you, you are now responsible.

929
01:42:16,292 --> 01:42:17,693
[SPEAKER_11]: And please take that to heart.

930
01:42:18,293 --> 01:42:20,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Putting him in his place.

931
01:42:20,954 --> 01:42:22,835
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's right here in the Mustang Hall of Fame.

932
01:42:23,565 --> 01:42:30,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

933
01:42:30,388 --> 01:42:31,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

934
01:42:33,209 --> 01:42:34,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Jack's famous lines.

935
01:42:35,930 --> 01:42:36,730
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got too many of them.

936
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:38,691
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'll keep it short and sweet.

937
01:42:39,571 --> 01:42:41,452
[SPEAKER_11]: We could be anywhere at any time.

938
01:42:42,092 --> 01:42:45,853
[SPEAKER_11]: We could be on the field at 9 in the morning getting ready for a game at 1 in the afternoon.

939
01:42:46,233 --> 01:42:50,395
[SPEAKER_11]: We could be all done, and we're in the dugout, and it's getting dark.

940
01:42:51,217 --> 01:42:54,040
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not even on the field, it can be in my backyard.

941
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:57,023
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit of wine, just talking.

942
01:42:57,824 --> 01:43:05,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Every single day, this man and I talk about those young ladies.

943
01:43:06,053 --> 01:43:07,635
[SPEAKER_11]: In passing, it doesn't matter.

944
01:43:07,655 --> 01:43:13,021
[SPEAKER_11]: We can talk about the team, we can talk about the game, we can talk about the player, we can talk about

945
01:43:16,630 --> 01:43:18,691
[SPEAKER_11]: and I look forward to it every day.

946
01:43:18,771 --> 01:43:21,472
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the funnest day of my life.

947
01:43:21,812 --> 01:43:27,454
[SPEAKER_11]: That word fun in that program is the heart of what this man is all about.

948
01:43:29,395 --> 01:43:30,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep that in mind.

949
01:43:30,495 --> 01:43:31,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Please, keep that in mind.

950
01:43:33,536 --> 01:43:37,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Quickly, this is what my observations have been in 10 years.

951
01:43:38,698 --> 01:43:41,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Pied Piper gathers the masses.

952
01:43:42,319 --> 01:43:43,740
[SPEAKER_11]: A master motivator.

953
01:43:45,056 --> 01:43:47,537
[SPEAKER_11]: He never has a bad day.

954
01:43:47,557 --> 01:43:52,058
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a positive approach.

955
01:43:53,238 --> 01:43:57,660
[SPEAKER_11]: And he has this attitude that is matched by nobody.

956
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:02,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Incredible human being, and by the way, he does not know how to swear.

957
01:44:02,601 --> 01:44:03,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to let you know that.

958
01:44:08,388 --> 01:44:10,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Nonetheless, I'll just be quick on this story.

959
01:44:10,889 --> 01:44:12,269
[SPEAKER_11]: His influence on me.

960
01:44:12,309 --> 01:44:15,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Chuck and Andre said, Charlie, come on, we got to go coach the Chiefs this year.

961
01:44:15,491 --> 01:44:16,391
[SPEAKER_11]: I got your uniform.

962
01:44:16,791 --> 01:44:17,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?

963
01:44:17,091 --> 01:44:18,532
[SPEAKER_07]: You remember that conversation.

964
01:44:19,012 --> 01:44:21,813
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, Chuck, I'm coaching the girls softball.

965
01:44:22,293 --> 01:44:22,993
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going.

966
01:44:23,974 --> 01:44:24,834
[SPEAKER_11]: He couldn't believe it.

967
01:44:25,274 --> 01:44:26,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Shaking his head to this day.

968
01:44:27,295 --> 01:44:29,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Bill Honeycutt, he could not be here.

969
01:44:29,076 --> 01:44:30,356
[SPEAKER_11]: I spoke with him yesterday.

970
01:44:30,656 --> 01:44:32,397
[SPEAKER_11]: He sends his congratulations, Uncle.

971
01:44:40,238 --> 01:44:44,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Number one, number one, because without him, we don't have a program.

972
01:44:44,821 --> 01:44:45,761
[SPEAKER_11]: He's our contributor.

973
01:44:45,801 --> 01:44:46,602
[SPEAKER_11]: He's our sponsor.

974
01:44:46,622 --> 01:44:48,643
[SPEAKER_11]: He's the guy who can do anything for you.

975
01:44:48,683 --> 01:44:49,404
[SPEAKER_11]: We love him.

976
01:44:51,205 --> 01:44:52,445
[SPEAKER_11]: He calls me up one day.

977
01:44:52,525 --> 01:44:55,287
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the 3rd of July, in the summertime.

978
01:44:55,707 --> 01:44:58,669
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how the weeks go in July, in this beautiful week ahead.

979
01:44:59,009 --> 01:45:00,670
[SPEAKER_11]: He calls me up on the 3rd of July.

980
01:45:01,171 --> 01:45:02,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Joey, come on down.

981
01:45:02,692 --> 01:45:04,052
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got this place in Virginia.

982
01:45:04,092 --> 01:45:05,553
[SPEAKER_11]: He goes, come on, I got the barbecue ready.

983
01:45:05,573 --> 01:45:06,454
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go golfing.

984
01:45:08,185 --> 01:45:08,925
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go to the beach.

985
01:45:09,065 --> 01:45:10,226
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got everything lined up.

986
01:45:10,246 --> 01:45:10,686
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got everything.

987
01:45:10,746 --> 01:45:12,626
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got the food, the wine, everything.

988
01:45:12,686 --> 01:45:13,266
[SPEAKER_11]: We're ready to go.

989
01:45:13,286 --> 01:45:14,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go.

990
01:45:14,067 --> 01:45:15,167
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, Bill, I can't make it.

991
01:45:15,187 --> 01:45:17,047
[SPEAKER_11]: He said, why not?

992
01:45:18,508 --> 01:45:19,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm a cop.

993
01:45:19,308 --> 01:45:20,308
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm driving.

994
01:45:21,369 --> 01:45:21,609
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

995
01:45:22,369 --> 01:45:23,849
[SPEAKER_11]: He said, well, come back when you're all done.

996
01:45:23,869 --> 01:45:24,289
[SPEAKER_11]: He goes, no.

997
01:45:24,349 --> 01:45:31,912
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, Bill, I'm in Pennsylvania on a highway going to Quakertown, and I'm going to coach in a girls' tournament with Jack.

998
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:36,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Jack can have a cell phone, and he can have everything Billy is saying that I can't repeat.

999
01:45:37,585 --> 01:45:39,406
[SPEAKER_11]: But that was my response to him.

1000
01:45:39,467 --> 01:45:41,348
[SPEAKER_11]: He said, well, I'll see you later.

1001
01:45:41,368 --> 01:45:43,109
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't been down to the vineyard since.

1002
01:45:43,810 --> 01:45:48,774
[SPEAKER_11]: But Jack and I, for the next hour on a highway in Pennsylvania, were just cracking up.

1003
01:45:49,474 --> 01:45:51,596
[SPEAKER_11]: And Billy was just in hysterics yesterday.

1004
01:45:51,736 --> 01:45:53,718
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to tell that story.

1005
01:45:53,778 --> 01:45:55,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Unbelievable.

1006
01:45:55,659 --> 01:45:57,561
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, I'm done.

1007
01:45:57,781 --> 01:46:00,683
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I'm going to do is this.

1008
01:46:01,684 --> 01:46:06,568
[SPEAKER_11]: It is my honor and privilege to introduce to you

1009
01:46:08,699 --> 01:46:28,132
[SPEAKER_11]: newest member of the Mustang Hall of Fame, the teacher, coach, my uncle, my other big brother, and my best friend, Coach Jack Jensen.

1010
01:46:48,510 --> 01:46:50,892
[SPEAKER_30]: Wow, how do I follow up on that?

1011
01:46:50,932 --> 01:47:05,403
[SPEAKER_30]: So I have a few things to say, but I first would like to recognize some people here and get my wife's mother's glasses, because I forgot mine at home.

1012
01:47:05,443 --> 01:47:06,884
George, she's 90 years old.

1013
01:47:17,103 --> 01:47:20,085
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, so first of all, thank you very much.

1014
01:47:20,105 --> 01:47:21,645
[SPEAKER_30]: That was unbelievable.

1015
01:47:22,406 --> 01:47:29,269
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, incredible.

1016
01:47:30,950 --> 01:47:36,293
[SPEAKER_30]: I have so much to say, I could probably be here an hour and a half talking about a lot of people in here, believe me.

1017
01:47:36,793 --> 01:47:39,855
[SPEAKER_30]: But I'm gonna really try to cut it down.

1018
01:47:40,695 --> 01:47:45,838
[SPEAKER_30]: But first of all, I'd like to thank the committee, the Hall of Fame committee,

1019
01:47:46,650 --> 01:47:54,753
[SPEAKER_30]: And all the people from Mark, and Dave, and Reggie, and Megan, and there's tons of people here.

1020
01:47:54,793 --> 01:47:55,473
[SPEAKER_30]: Let me see.

1021
01:47:56,474 --> 01:48:01,576
[SPEAKER_30]: These guys go way back with me playing sports, coaching, that sort of directory, teaching.

1022
01:48:02,576 --> 01:48:04,257
[SPEAKER_30]: They do an unbelievable job.

1023
01:48:04,277 --> 01:48:12,560
[SPEAKER_30]: And I'm going to probably bounce around a little bit, because when I first came in, I didn't realize certain people were going to be here.

1024
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:15,801
[SPEAKER_30]: But I just can't thank Coach Tags enough.

1025
01:48:16,389 --> 01:48:22,332
[SPEAKER_30]: And we have some pretty good stories, but we'll be here till tomorrow if we start talking about them.

1026
01:48:22,372 --> 01:48:23,092
[SPEAKER_30]: We would.

1027
01:48:24,553 --> 01:48:33,798
[SPEAKER_30]: I'd like to thank our new superintendent, Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent, over here, who's with Mr. Paul O'Leary, the headmaster.

1028
01:48:34,238 --> 01:48:40,421
[SPEAKER_30]: She is such a great person and such a tremendous addition to the city of Medford, I can't tell you.

1029
01:48:40,862 --> 01:48:43,403
[SPEAKER_30]: The first, this wasn't even planned, so.

1030
01:48:44,176 --> 01:48:51,457
[SPEAKER_30]: First week of school, I was following her around in the bus, videotaping the school, and she was going to the schools, meeting all the kids.

1031
01:48:51,817 --> 01:48:55,678
[SPEAKER_30]: I'll tell you, she is a tremendous influence on the kids in our city.

1032
01:48:55,698 --> 01:49:05,860
[SPEAKER_30]: Dr. Maurice is so beautiful.

1033
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:10,221
[SPEAKER_30]: Next, I'd like to recognize my family and friends.

1034
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:16,988
[SPEAKER_30]: Always be happy that a good man is in the rhythm of a good woman.

1035
01:49:23,962 --> 01:49:34,248
[SPEAKER_30]: And then just looking at the tables, these are all my relatives, and my daughter and son, Jack and Tim, and fiance, Brent, and wife, Megan, and Carol, and Mr. Green.

1036
01:49:34,328 --> 01:49:36,109
[SPEAKER_30]: I think a lot of you people know Mr. Green.

1037
01:49:36,269 --> 01:49:38,050
[SPEAKER_30]: I know a lot of the whole thing.

1038
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:38,911
[SPEAKER_30]: Many know Mr. Green.

1039
01:49:39,251 --> 01:49:40,171
[SPEAKER_30]: Long time friend.

1040
01:49:40,652 --> 01:49:45,494
[SPEAKER_30]: I get stories there to tell about, but we won't talk about that tonight.

1041
01:49:45,514 --> 01:49:46,155
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. Nick Tucci.

1042
01:49:46,785 --> 01:49:51,426
[SPEAKER_30]: who went to college with my son Tim, they were roommates, they played baseball together.

1043
01:49:52,606 --> 01:50:01,229
[SPEAKER_30]: Nick now, as you know, is the headmaster at the McGuinn School in Bedford, and also a Hall of Famer, a Hall of Fame baseball player.

1044
01:50:02,369 --> 01:50:06,490
[SPEAKER_30]: Speaking of that, I just want to read off a few quick names, if you guys could stand up.

1045
01:50:07,528 --> 01:50:07,908
[SPEAKER_30]: All right?

1046
01:50:08,749 --> 01:50:10,070
[SPEAKER_30]: And I'll just tell you what I'm getting at.

1047
01:50:10,610 --> 01:50:21,138
[SPEAKER_30]: Vic Garrow, Dave Polcari, Charlie Paggs, Charlie Paggs Jr., Chuck Andre, Mike Andre, Steve N.P.F., no one says it enough.

1048
01:50:21,258 --> 01:50:28,824
[SPEAKER_30]: Pat, Pat McNaughton, Nick Tucci, Ben Walden, John Canava, Dave Crowley, Paul Manitow.

1049
01:50:30,906 --> 01:50:31,806
[SPEAKER_30]: Am I missing anyone?

1050
01:50:31,986 --> 01:50:32,547
[SPEAKER_30]: Any other?

1051
01:50:33,525 --> 01:50:35,407
[SPEAKER_30]: Midfield baseball players here.

1052
01:50:35,787 --> 01:50:37,548
[SPEAKER_30]: There were Hall of Fame caliber players.

1053
01:50:38,329 --> 01:50:41,291
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, we have a Hall of Fame baseball team right here.

1054
01:50:41,931 --> 01:50:52,239
[SPEAKER_30]: The catcher is Dave Crowley.

1055
01:50:53,400 --> 01:51:00,705
[SPEAKER_30]: The coach, even though Dave O'Connor and Nick Tucci didn't come in this job, Paul Navatale is my coach.

1056
01:51:05,302 --> 01:51:07,023
[SPEAKER_30]: so much for the program.

1057
01:51:07,503 --> 01:51:11,265
[SPEAKER_30]: And then probably the best basketball player to ever come out of the city, Richie Graham.

1058
01:51:17,489 --> 01:51:23,092
[SPEAKER_30]: Few people know that, let me see, where's Lindy?

1059
01:51:23,832 --> 01:51:28,935
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh yeah, the greatest woman athlete in the school's history, Lindy Sanagosa.

1060
01:51:36,250 --> 01:51:37,950
[SPEAKER_30]: coming back elementary gym teacher.

1061
01:51:38,531 --> 01:51:39,191
[SPEAKER_30]: What a school.

1062
01:51:40,111 --> 01:51:40,591
[SPEAKER_30]: We'll call it out.

1063
01:51:40,671 --> 01:51:48,933
[SPEAKER_30]: Probably leave out a lot of people here, but just seeing these guys in the wheelchair, you have to recognize them.

1064
01:51:49,053 --> 01:51:51,434
[SPEAKER_30]: All right, I guess that took long.

1065
01:51:51,614 --> 01:51:54,295
[SPEAKER_30]: We're gonna move it along.

1066
01:51:54,755 --> 01:51:58,396
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't wanna take that too long.

1067
01:51:59,556 --> 01:52:01,377
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, just a few quick stories.

1068
01:52:02,017 --> 01:52:05,758
[SPEAKER_30]: And the good thing about being up here as a coach, I can talk about you guys.

1069
01:52:06,270 --> 01:52:07,470
[SPEAKER_30]: I love it.

1070
01:52:07,610 --> 01:52:13,412
[SPEAKER_30]: And all you have to do is look at the inductees today, the Hall of Fame inductees.

1071
01:52:13,432 --> 01:52:16,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you find it?

1072
01:52:16,574 --> 01:52:17,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1073
01:52:18,534 --> 01:52:19,094
[SPEAKER_11]: First page.

1074
01:52:19,114 --> 01:52:20,635
[SPEAKER_11]: You folded the thing.

1075
01:52:20,655 --> 01:52:22,616
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know where the first page is.

1076
01:52:22,656 --> 01:52:23,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

1077
01:52:23,836 --> 01:52:23,956
OK.

1078
01:52:24,216 --> 01:52:29,078
[SPEAKER_30]: So like I said, I've been here a long time coaching and teaching and everything.

1079
01:52:29,558 --> 01:52:33,819
[SPEAKER_30]: And I look at the Hall of Fame inductees today, and it feels like my field is here.

1080
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:35,360
[SPEAKER_30]: Just going to go over quickly.

1081
01:52:36,005 --> 01:52:40,206
[SPEAKER_30]: Who they are, I either coached them, met them in a former teacher.

1082
01:52:42,066 --> 01:52:44,827
[SPEAKER_30]: In some way, they were involved with me.

1083
01:52:46,167 --> 01:52:50,048
[SPEAKER_30]: Nate Clement, Nicole, and Sarah Lovolato.

1084
01:52:50,888 --> 01:52:56,969
[SPEAKER_30]: And incidentally, what Sarah said about Nicole, her intensity, is that Nicole over here?

1085
01:52:57,689 --> 01:53:00,990
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, we had an alumni softball game this June.

1086
01:53:01,150 --> 01:53:02,030
[SPEAKER_30]: There'd be a woman playing.

1087
01:53:02,566 --> 01:53:03,526
[SPEAKER_30]: Nicole comes up to me.

1088
01:53:03,806 --> 01:53:04,887
[SPEAKER_30]: Coach, we have to win.

1089
01:53:05,147 --> 01:53:06,167
[SPEAKER_30]: We have to play bad.

1090
01:53:06,567 --> 01:53:09,528
[SPEAKER_30]: I said, Nicole, that lady's 75 years old.

1091
01:53:09,608 --> 01:53:14,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just playing a toy on her.

1092
01:53:14,749 --> 01:53:15,649
[SPEAKER_30]: Ben Waldman.

1093
01:53:15,989 --> 01:53:18,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Talo Andrei.

1094
01:53:18,090 --> 01:53:19,090
[SPEAKER_30]: Talo Andrei.

1095
01:53:19,230 --> 01:53:20,210
[SPEAKER_30]: One thing was left out.

1096
01:53:20,530 --> 01:53:21,631
[SPEAKER_30]: Nicole, Talo Andrei.

1097
01:53:21,651 --> 01:53:24,471
[SPEAKER_30]: Three ACL tears, right?

1098
01:53:25,351 --> 01:53:29,452
[SPEAKER_30]: She ran the Boston Marathon this year in 38 degree weather.

1099
01:53:29,652 --> 01:53:31,473
[SPEAKER_30]: The rain coming right in her face.

1100
01:53:32,127 --> 01:53:36,968
[SPEAKER_30]: and completed the Boston Marathon, very few people can understand what that means.

1101
01:53:37,288 --> 01:53:37,948
[SPEAKER_30]: Tyler did that.

1102
01:53:45,870 --> 01:53:53,611
[SPEAKER_30]: A few years ago, no, about 10 years ago, at a baseball game, Chuck Andres' team's playing Steve Mebier's team.

1103
01:53:54,012 --> 01:53:54,992
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm with Coach Pax.

1104
01:53:55,552 --> 01:53:57,652
[SPEAKER_30]: And I said, who's that old guy in the right field?

1105
01:53:58,052 --> 01:53:59,653
[SPEAKER_30]: He goes, that's Steve Mebier.

1106
01:53:59,693 --> 01:54:00,553
[SPEAKER_30]: I go, huh.

1107
01:54:01,497 --> 01:54:02,897
[SPEAKER_30]: He's still playing baseball.

1108
01:54:03,937 --> 01:54:06,918
[SPEAKER_30]: Steve, where are you?

1109
01:54:06,938 --> 01:54:16,220
[SPEAKER_30]: I think there's a compliment in there somewhere.

1110
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:20,740
[SPEAKER_30]: So this is what I mean by Hall of Fame type people.

1111
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:21,721
[SPEAKER_30]: Here's another good one.

1112
01:54:22,301 --> 01:54:23,581
[SPEAKER_30]: Pat McCarthy over here.

1113
01:54:24,181 --> 01:54:26,682
[SPEAKER_30]: He was one of my video students in 1998, 97.

1114
01:54:26,742 --> 01:54:27,482
[SPEAKER_30]: He's a movie star.

1115
01:54:29,684 --> 01:54:33,967
[SPEAKER_30]: He was the Pan Man Hunter in a movie that the kids made that actually made it to Hollywood.

1116
01:54:34,808 --> 01:54:38,690
[SPEAKER_30]: No, but he wasn't in that movie, but he was part of the original movie that we made.

1117
01:54:39,431 --> 01:54:40,592
[SPEAKER_30]: Great baseball player.

1118
01:54:41,232 --> 01:54:43,614
[SPEAKER_30]: Then you got Sam Lovolato.

1119
01:54:44,475 --> 01:54:48,077
[SPEAKER_30]: Probably the greatest third baseman, was the greatest third baseman we ever had.

1120
01:54:48,477 --> 01:54:52,760
[SPEAKER_30]: Someone, I guess Sarah mentioned, and well, it's funny we get to see Sam as much.

1121
01:54:53,121 --> 01:54:54,522
[SPEAKER_30]: Sam is unbelievable.

1122
01:54:55,222 --> 01:54:55,983
[SPEAKER_30]: Great dancer too.

1123
01:54:59,075 --> 01:55:04,542
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, just a couple of quick stories, I guess.

1124
01:55:05,524 --> 01:55:07,066
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, just some memorable moments.

1125
01:55:07,632 --> 01:55:12,256
[SPEAKER_30]: I started in 1982 in track in Medford.

1126
01:55:12,696 --> 01:55:16,259
[SPEAKER_30]: And I just remember, this is what really kind of motivated me to coach.

1127
01:55:16,799 --> 01:55:22,403
[SPEAKER_30]: There was a girl named, a woman I guess now, Lynn Sartino was running a 1,000 meter run.

1128
01:55:22,964 --> 01:55:24,405
[SPEAKER_30]: She dove at the finish line.

1129
01:55:24,425 --> 01:55:26,026
[SPEAKER_30]: This is my first year coaching.

1130
01:55:26,687 --> 01:55:34,953
[SPEAKER_30]: And she won the race, and I just looked and said, she's in a regular dual meet with one other team, and she's diving to win the race.

1131
01:55:35,597 --> 01:55:39,901
[SPEAKER_30]: And that showed me so much that I said, hey, I got to keep doing this stuff.

1132
01:55:40,341 --> 01:55:45,125
[SPEAKER_30]: Longwood Walsh, I got a quick, the kids know Longwood Walsh, she graduated a few years back.

1133
01:55:46,266 --> 01:55:49,508
[SPEAKER_30]: She just sent me a quick text congratulating me.

1134
01:55:49,789 --> 01:55:55,633
[SPEAKER_30]: She was a very good, this is mine on the track team, and a real good softball player.

1135
01:55:56,174 --> 01:56:01,078
[SPEAKER_30]: But she was doing the high jump in the Greater Boston League Championships, and she was tied for first place.

1136
01:56:01,610 --> 01:56:05,733
[SPEAKER_30]: The 1,000-meter dash came up, and they had the option to run that.

1137
01:56:06,053 --> 01:56:07,314
[SPEAKER_30]: She has to go back to the high jump.

1138
01:56:07,955 --> 01:56:15,580
[SPEAKER_30]: So not only did she win the 1,000, she comes back in the high jump and says, coach, my legs are killing me.

1139
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:16,061
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm tired.

1140
01:56:16,081 --> 01:56:17,682
[SPEAKER_30]: I can't go back and jump right away.

1141
01:56:18,202 --> 01:56:19,043
[SPEAKER_30]: And that's true, too.

1142
01:56:19,063 --> 01:56:21,264
[SPEAKER_30]: You run a race like that, especially a 1,000-meter.

1143
01:56:22,465 --> 01:56:25,548
[SPEAKER_30]: And we called her a running girl, because all she did was run.

1144
01:56:25,588 --> 01:56:29,110
[SPEAKER_30]: I'd say, go turn the lights on at the end of the race.

1145
01:56:29,130 --> 01:56:31,252
[SPEAKER_30]: She'd run over the field house and turn the lights on.

1146
01:56:31,960 --> 01:56:42,944
[SPEAKER_30]: Make a long story short, she won the thousand, which was, I mean, won the high jump, came back and won it, and I just, you know, right there I'm saying, these kids are tremendous.

1147
01:56:44,384 --> 01:56:47,205
[SPEAKER_30]: Another couple of funny stories.

1148
01:56:47,805 --> 01:56:58,889
[SPEAKER_30]: I broke my ribs back a while ago, and I go into the hospital to have x-rays, this is like 2004 or something, and strong enough, the x-ray technician,

1149
01:56:59,301 --> 01:57:01,022
[SPEAKER_30]: Hey, Coach Dempsey, what are you doing here?

1150
01:57:01,063 --> 01:57:03,685
[SPEAKER_30]: So she kind of takes care of me.

1151
01:57:03,705 --> 01:57:09,129
[SPEAKER_30]: The year 2000, I'm at Logan Airport going to Florida in security.

1152
01:57:09,569 --> 01:57:12,332
[SPEAKER_30]: So the TSA comes up and says, we have to check you.

1153
01:57:12,912 --> 01:57:18,096
[SPEAKER_30]: They open the curtain, and the kid that's checking me out is one of my former track kids.

1154
01:57:18,357 --> 01:57:20,418
[SPEAKER_30]: He goes, hey, Coach Dempsey, remember when we met?

1155
01:57:20,498 --> 01:57:22,240
[SPEAKER_30]: And he's doing the thing over there.

1156
01:57:24,222 --> 01:57:28,125
[SPEAKER_30]: Two years later, Logan Airport, they want to check me out again.

1157
01:57:28,903 --> 01:57:37,148
[SPEAKER_30]: Another student, a track athlete of mine, same exact thing, just shows us what a small world is.

1158
01:57:38,369 --> 01:57:39,970
[SPEAKER_30]: Another quick story here.

1159
01:57:39,990 --> 01:57:41,731
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know if I'm gonna fall.

1160
01:57:41,771 --> 01:57:43,992
[SPEAKER_30]: I know a few of you girls probably live in Cancun, maybe.

1161
01:57:44,393 --> 01:57:47,995
[SPEAKER_30]: We're playing Cambridge, driving rainstorm in Cambridge.

1162
01:57:48,155 --> 01:57:51,157
[SPEAKER_30]: And I know the game's gonna be called.

1163
01:57:51,597 --> 01:57:56,300
[SPEAKER_30]: So one of the girls, Casey Ramirez, says, Coach, should we go play in the rain?

1164
01:57:56,860 --> 01:57:57,841
[SPEAKER_30]: And we're standing on the dugout.

1165
01:57:58,563 --> 01:58:02,586
[SPEAKER_30]: and let them go out, the girls are doing it.

1166
01:58:02,686 --> 01:58:06,448
[SPEAKER_30]: Dancing in the maze, the Rick Dempsey home run trot in the rain.

1167
01:58:07,008 --> 01:58:12,432
[SPEAKER_30]: So they go over to the canvas girls, bring them over, and Pegs and I were just kind of watching what's going on.

1168
01:58:12,872 --> 01:58:17,895
[SPEAKER_30]: But my philosophy is work hard, play hard, and have fun.

1169
01:58:18,533 --> 01:58:21,515
[SPEAKER_30]: That's probably what I forgot to say, but, and that works.

1170
01:58:21,835 --> 01:58:22,815
[SPEAKER_30]: Believe me, it works.

1171
01:58:23,075 --> 01:58:30,259
[SPEAKER_30]: Whether it's with older people, younger people, and of course, a lot of different age kids and grown-ups.

1172
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:36,583
[SPEAKER_30]: Another quick story was with, no.

1173
01:58:38,224 --> 01:58:43,567
[SPEAKER_30]: This is like probably the last thing I'm gonna talk about.

1174
01:58:43,687 --> 01:58:48,069
[SPEAKER_30]: In 2000, 2017, there was a school committee meeting,

1175
01:58:48,405 --> 01:59:02,120
[SPEAKER_30]: We had a little bit of a problem with some fundraising issues, a bunch of the sports teams, so they selected me to go up and represent the softball team and actually all the athletic teams.

1176
01:59:02,617 --> 01:59:05,419
[SPEAKER_30]: And we're in the Medford Library in the city.

1177
01:59:05,860 --> 01:59:09,523
[SPEAKER_30]: School community people all lined up in a U-shaped thing, all looking at me.

1178
01:59:10,243 --> 01:59:11,744
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm not looking at you yet.

1179
01:59:11,844 --> 01:59:14,387
[SPEAKER_30]: So I'm sitting down, and then they call, OK, Coach Dempsey.

1180
01:59:14,407 --> 01:59:16,588
[SPEAKER_30]: Because I'm walking up, I sit in the chair, I face them.

1181
01:59:17,189 --> 01:59:20,632
[SPEAKER_30]: I hear behind me, hey, coach, we get your back.

1182
01:59:21,332 --> 01:59:26,056
[SPEAKER_30]: There's three girls in the softball program and all their parents.

1183
01:59:26,456 --> 01:59:28,478
[SPEAKER_30]: And when they said that, the coach

1184
01:59:28,797 --> 01:59:34,099
[SPEAKER_30]: Everyone in the school committee started looking and smiling and laughing, and the mayor and everyone that was there.

1185
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:46,005
[SPEAKER_30]: And you could tell right there that we were going to win that decision by just showing what this program means and how the kids and the parents really believe in you.

1186
01:59:46,125 --> 01:59:51,727
[SPEAKER_30]: Last but not least, greatest game, maybe the greatest sporting event ever in the history of men.

1187
01:59:52,548 --> 01:59:53,548
[SPEAKER_30]: In my eyes, it was.

1188
01:59:53,908 --> 01:59:55,829
[SPEAKER_30]: You guys probably have something to say about that.

1189
01:59:56,890 --> 01:59:57,610
[SPEAKER_30]: Two years ago,

1190
01:59:58,605 --> 02:00:04,671
[SPEAKER_30]: We're playing in the state tournament, softball state tournament, in the quarterfinals against Chelmsford.

1191
02:00:05,491 --> 02:00:07,673
[SPEAKER_30]: Drizzled rain, kind of a tough day.

1192
02:00:08,274 --> 02:00:12,178
[SPEAKER_30]: We're losing by seven runs in the last of the seventh inning.

1193
02:00:13,479 --> 02:00:16,742
[SPEAKER_30]: And nowhere, and we're facing a very good pitcher.

1194
02:00:16,782 --> 02:00:18,864
[SPEAKER_30]: Steve just marked off the top seed in the tournament.

1195
02:00:19,464 --> 02:00:23,048
[SPEAKER_30]: Facing a very good pitcher, but our kids never quit.

1196
02:00:24,038 --> 02:00:28,020
[SPEAKER_30]: That table over there with the seven girls in it, they're all softball players.

1197
02:00:28,460 --> 02:00:31,402
[SPEAKER_30]: Most of them are back, five of them are captains coming up this year.

1198
02:00:31,802 --> 02:00:32,902
[SPEAKER_30]: They played in that game.

1199
02:00:33,543 --> 02:00:40,406
[SPEAKER_30]: And if you saw the Red Sox this year running around hugging each other, like in the World Series, that's what happened that day.

1200
02:00:40,826 --> 02:00:43,468
[SPEAKER_30]: And to me, this was much better than the Red Sox game.

1201
02:00:43,688 --> 02:00:46,769
[SPEAKER_30]: But it was the make of the athletes that did it.

1202
02:00:47,229 --> 02:00:52,112
[SPEAKER_30]: And just going back a bunch of years, didn't even allow girls to play sports.

1203
02:00:52,823 --> 02:00:55,626
[SPEAKER_30]: And they can have the opportunity to experience this.

1204
02:00:56,047 --> 02:00:59,511
[SPEAKER_30]: And watching that, to me, I was just flabbergasted.

1205
02:00:59,591 --> 02:01:02,754
[SPEAKER_30]: It was one of the great, great thrills of my life.

1206
02:01:03,375 --> 02:01:06,398
[SPEAKER_30]: And with that, I'm just going to end saying, that's why I keep coaching.

1207
02:01:22,592 --> 02:01:22,692
Yeah.

1208
02:01:53,032 --> 02:01:53,072
Ha!

1209
02:02:02,297 --> 02:02:02,417
OK.

1210
02:02:02,497 --> 02:02:04,378
So John Conano, class of 1945.

1211
02:02:04,478 --> 02:02:08,040
Unfortunately, his family could not join us today.

1212
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:19,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Back in September, when I talked to them about him being selected to be inducted, I could see the big sighs over the phone.

1213
02:02:19,524 --> 02:02:26,207
[SPEAKER_15]: So on his family's behalf, I'm going to say a few words about John Conano.

1214
02:02:30,961 --> 02:02:38,189
[SPEAKER_15]: So John played football and earned three letters, played halfback, and basketball, he earned three letters as a starting forward.

1215
02:02:38,269 --> 02:02:45,637
[SPEAKER_15]: He was the second leading scorer and a member of our Metro team that went to the Tech Tourney.

1216
02:02:45,798 --> 02:02:47,820
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember the Tech Tourney?

1217
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:49,582
[SPEAKER_15]: The Tech Tourney that lost to Perennial.

1218
02:02:49,602 --> 02:02:52,025
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if some of you are old enough to see the files.

1219
02:02:52,862 --> 02:03:00,753
[SPEAKER_15]: In baseball, he played junior year on a team that went to the 1944, his junior year, Eastern Mass Finals.

1220
02:03:00,833 --> 02:03:03,997
[SPEAKER_15]: However, in 1945, in baseball, he did not play his senior year.

1221
02:03:04,738 --> 02:03:07,642
[SPEAKER_15]: He did not play because he enlisted in the Army to go fight World War II.

1222
02:03:10,877 --> 02:03:13,759
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think, um, I didn't know John.

1223
02:03:14,419 --> 02:03:17,821
[SPEAKER_15]: I did grow up down the street from his brother and his family.

1224
02:03:17,841 --> 02:03:21,043
[SPEAKER_15]: I knew the kids, his nephews and nieces.

1225
02:03:21,063 --> 02:03:27,146
[SPEAKER_15]: And if he, they came, they were great kids, great competitors, great athletes.

1226
02:03:27,466 --> 02:03:34,070
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, good stock started with John and his brother Al, who's also a Hall of Fame as well.

1227
02:03:35,149 --> 02:03:41,251
[SPEAKER_15]: So, on John's behalf, and unfortunately, John passed away this past February.

1228
02:03:42,432 --> 02:03:47,694
[SPEAKER_15]: So, it would have been nice if we could have been at the stadium first, or maybe an induction or two ago.

1229
02:03:48,814 --> 02:03:59,638
[SPEAKER_15]: But on his behalf, and on the students' behalf, I'm happy to present and accept the Hall of Fame induction plaque for John Canuffa, Class of 2014.

1230
02:04:15,834 --> 02:04:17,555
[SPEAKER_15]: We can send this to the family.

1231
02:04:43,082 --> 02:04:47,465
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, what page is down in the awarding?

1232
02:04:47,565 --> 02:04:53,249
[SPEAKER_15]: If you look in your program books, there's one page that is titled in the awarding.

1233
02:04:55,811 --> 02:04:58,753
[SPEAKER_15]: We have our lecture ceremonies now once every two years.

1234
02:04:59,374 --> 02:05:04,117
[SPEAKER_15]: And over the course of that two-year period, we make note of and often visit

1235
02:05:06,712 --> 02:05:13,574
[SPEAKER_15]: and funerals that sent flowers from the Hall of Fame to Hall of Famers who have passed away since the last induction ceremony.

1236
02:05:14,615 --> 02:05:16,055
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll see the names listed there.

1237
02:05:16,976 --> 02:05:23,198
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we could now just take a moment of silence to reflect on their behalf.

1238
02:05:38,821 --> 02:05:43,576
[SPEAKER_15]: The next introduction will be made by Nicole Fajardo.

1239
02:05:54,943 --> 02:06:07,309
[SPEAKER_25]: Let me take you back to 1993 when a little boy put on his first pair of skates and begged his dad to let him get a slush in the hockey rink instead of going on the ice to earn him his skateboard.

1240
02:06:07,349 --> 02:06:11,230
[SPEAKER_25]: Two years and a lot of slush later, the game all changed.

1241
02:06:11,250 --> 02:06:14,172
[SPEAKER_25]: Now Rob was on a team and loved every minute of being on the ice.

1242
02:06:15,093 --> 02:06:19,018
[SPEAKER_25]: Even though our mold doesn't rock, we go to play on the same rocky team.

1243
02:06:19,058 --> 02:06:21,021
[SPEAKER_25]: We play defense and I play right wing.

1244
02:06:21,702 --> 02:06:25,927
[SPEAKER_25]: During one of my games, Rob passed me the puck and I scored my very first goal.

1245
02:06:27,189 --> 02:06:30,974
[SPEAKER_25]: As the years went by, Rob excelled in both sports and academics.

1246
02:06:31,695 --> 02:06:36,876
[SPEAKER_25]: My dad always told us we could play any sport we wanted, as long as we got all of our homework done.

1247
02:06:37,476 --> 02:06:39,317
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's exactly what my brother did.

1248
02:06:39,797 --> 02:06:45,018
[SPEAKER_25]: He took honors classes in high school, helped tutor students, and played both hockey and golf.

1249
02:06:45,738 --> 02:06:52,640
[SPEAKER_25]: His sophomore year, he got to experience being part of the team that made it to the Super 8, and even got to play in the T.E.

1250
02:06:52,700 --> 02:06:52,860
[SPEAKER_25]: class.

1251
02:06:54,420 --> 02:07:01,147
[SPEAKER_25]: I was so proud to watch him and his teammates represent Edford with such class and determination.

1252
02:07:01,808 --> 02:07:05,832
[SPEAKER_25]: Although they did not make it to the finals, it was an experience we will never forget.

1253
02:07:06,609 --> 02:07:17,522
[SPEAKER_25]: His senior year, he earned a few awards, including the Phelan Award, which is given out at the end of playing right to someone who does well in both academics and athletics.

1254
02:07:17,562 --> 02:07:22,448
[SPEAKER_25]: Through sports, Robert made many friends that have become like family.

1255
02:07:22,848 --> 02:07:26,513
[SPEAKER_25]: He was the best man in his friend Mike's wedding, who he met when he was seven.

1256
02:07:27,073 --> 02:07:30,397
[SPEAKER_25]: and played hockey with all the way up through high school.

1257
02:07:31,078 --> 02:07:34,322
[SPEAKER_25]: After high school, Rob attended college at Suffolk University.

1258
02:07:34,803 --> 02:07:37,646
[SPEAKER_25]: He graduated with a bachelor's degree in accounting.

1259
02:07:40,898 --> 02:07:43,259
[SPEAKER_25]: in a master's degree in taxation.

1260
02:07:43,759 --> 02:07:50,882
[SPEAKER_25]: I watched him study every day for hours as he prepared for his CPA exams, and he passed the very first time.

1261
02:07:50,902 --> 02:07:52,863
[SPEAKER_25]: I was once again a very proud sister.

1262
02:07:53,824 --> 02:07:58,566
[SPEAKER_25]: Rob is now a CPA and works as a manager for a company called Ernest & Young.

1263
02:07:59,126 --> 02:08:02,488
[SPEAKER_25]: He oversees a team in both the United States and in India.

1264
02:08:03,128 --> 02:08:07,770
[SPEAKER_25]: While in India this past year, he even got to play on one of the golf courses there.

1265
02:08:09,685 --> 02:08:18,748
[SPEAKER_25]: It is an honor to be a Mustang, to bleed blue and white, and to know what dedication, determination, sacrifice, joy, victory, and friendship means.

1266
02:08:19,468 --> 02:08:23,470
[SPEAKER_25]: Congratulations to my brother and to all the new members of the Mustang Hall of Fame.

1267
02:08:24,130 --> 02:08:24,930
You are all in the game.

1268
02:08:45,252 --> 02:08:45,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1269
02:08:45,653 --> 02:08:52,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I did write a speech, but I'm just not going to use it after all these wonderful speeches that everyone made today.

1270
02:08:52,697 --> 02:09:07,166
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, as my sister mentioned at my job, now I travel to India, I travel to Florida, and all different places across the world teaching taxes and uninteresting stuff, so I promise I won't talk about any of that.

1271
02:09:09,304 --> 02:09:25,295
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, as my sister mentioned 10 years ago, I was here for the M-Club award ceremony, and I'm especially proud of that, of the class of 2008, with Ben and John Costello and Kayla Sherry here as well, that are all Hall of Fame members.

1272
02:09:25,315 --> 02:09:28,037
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something I'm very proud of.

1273
02:09:29,402 --> 02:09:33,465
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the big joke in my work is that I'm never going to leave Medford.

1274
02:09:33,685 --> 02:09:35,606
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I just bought a house in Medford.

1275
02:09:35,826 --> 02:09:38,388
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably my favorite place, you know, to live.

1276
02:09:39,208 --> 02:09:46,813
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I recently joined as a board member, you know, to help oversee Hall of Fame inductees.

1277
02:09:47,293 --> 02:09:51,116
[SPEAKER_04]: And a personal goal of mine is to help keep, you know, seventh and eighth graders.

1278
02:09:51,696 --> 02:09:58,601
[SPEAKER_04]: from going to other high schools so they can succeed as student-athletes at Medford High School.

1279
02:09:58,901 --> 02:10:04,985
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm especially proud of is to see Mr. DeLaver here disagreeing with some of the teachers I had in high school.

1280
02:10:05,822 --> 02:10:22,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Scarpelli, some folks that aren't here that I really enjoyed my time with, Mr. Coffin, the gym teacher, and Mr. Jewett, who, you know, I never played golf in my life, and he told me to sign up for the golf team, and now it's my favorite hobby, you know, that I play.

1281
02:10:23,653 --> 02:10:33,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to thank the Hall of Fame board for this wonderful ceremony and congratulate all the wonderful athletes that are here.

1282
02:10:33,837 --> 02:10:41,040
[SPEAKER_04]: As my sister said, some of my closest friends are from playing sports and we often reminisce

1283
02:10:41,610 --> 02:10:46,412
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, playing in Super 8 or playing a golf course that, you know, we'll never get to play again.

1284
02:10:47,412 --> 02:10:55,795
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'd like to just, you know, wrap up and thank someone in particular, my dad, who always, you know, drove me to hockey.

1285
02:10:56,275 --> 02:10:59,156
[SPEAKER_04]: He used to take me down to Tony Lucci's to buy new skates.

1286
02:10:59,276 --> 02:11:01,977
[SPEAKER_04]: It stinks and, you know, I'm forever grateful.

1287
02:11:02,538 --> 02:11:03,198
[SPEAKER_04]: You know,

1288
02:11:04,140 --> 02:11:09,442
[SPEAKER_04]: At my job, we have to work tremendous hours, doing tax deadline seasons.

1289
02:11:10,322 --> 02:11:18,225
[SPEAKER_04]: And what keeps me going is that I grew up in Medford, and our tradition in pride is to win, no matter what the scenario is.

1290
02:11:19,065 --> 02:11:27,748
[SPEAKER_04]: And as we played hockey over the years, we won three state championships growing up, and then we made a run in high school super eight.

1291
02:11:27,788 --> 02:11:30,089
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's something I'm very proud of.

1292
02:11:31,536 --> 02:11:37,487
[SPEAKER_04]: The determination and discipline is something that Method Sports gave me, and I'm forever thankful for that.

1293
02:11:37,667 --> 02:11:38,810
[SPEAKER_04]: So, thank you everyone.

1294
02:11:39,070 --> 02:11:39,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a great night.

1295
02:12:10,184 --> 02:12:11,305
Okay, the next introduction will be made by Paul Mancura.

1296
02:12:34,978 --> 02:12:55,472
[SPEAKER_18]: Back in the, I don't know, the 10 days ago, the boys, Nick and Kevin were opening, I was opening the season, and I think they're going to win this one.

1297
02:13:00,685 --> 02:13:07,227
[SPEAKER_18]: The captain came to me and said, you know the guys are opening up in Arizona, you and I should go.

1298
02:13:07,247 --> 02:13:11,327
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're talking to a guy that does not like to fly at all.

1299
02:13:12,208 --> 02:13:22,930
[SPEAKER_18]: And we went, and I remember one night we were at a game, and I'm getting up in the night and I remember the guy called up, the shots thought it wasn't that good, but it's not that good, it's too small.

1300
02:13:22,950 --> 02:13:26,051
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course we know what that was, it was something.

1301
02:13:27,050 --> 02:13:28,051
[SPEAKER_18]: Who was the shot stopper?

1302
02:13:28,191 --> 02:13:30,353
[SPEAKER_18]: Come on, Charlie.

1303
02:13:30,373 --> 02:13:32,475
[SPEAKER_18]: Dustin, where are you?

1304
02:13:32,675 --> 02:13:36,078
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, look around this room.

1305
02:13:36,139 --> 02:13:39,422
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the cream of the crop for magic people.

1306
02:13:39,442 --> 02:13:42,544
[SPEAKER_18]: It's unbelievable, the people that are here tonight.

1307
02:13:43,045 --> 02:13:51,132
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an honor for me, as the Israelian coach, to present to you one of my all-time favorite players in tag.

1308
02:13:54,330 --> 02:13:59,813
[SPEAKER_18]: Discussing that with other coaches, I'm going to use all of Jake's terms, he's a throwback player.

1309
02:14:00,713 --> 02:14:12,218
[SPEAKER_18]: And what a throwback player is, he's a high-nosed athlete, an ultimate team player, a fight leader, he does his talking with his glove, his bat, and his shoulder pads.

1310
02:14:13,708 --> 02:14:14,549
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the resume.

1311
02:14:14,569 --> 02:14:16,229
[SPEAKER_18]: It's pretty impressive when you look at it.

1312
02:14:16,850 --> 02:14:18,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Football, three letters.

1313
02:14:19,010 --> 02:14:28,795
[SPEAKER_18]: Captain, GBL All-Star, two-way starter, leading rusher, leading receiver, leading scorer.

1314
02:14:29,355 --> 02:14:31,276
[SPEAKER_18]: There's not too many things left after that.

1315
02:14:31,676 --> 02:14:35,017
[SPEAKER_18]: In baseball, you have four letters.

1316
02:14:35,037 --> 02:14:37,679
[SPEAKER_18]: He was captain for a shortstop.

1317
02:14:37,699 --> 02:14:38,959
[SPEAKER_18]: He's a four-year starter.

1318
02:14:39,359 --> 02:14:40,900
[SPEAKER_18]: Two-time GBL All-Star.

1319
02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:42,201
[SPEAKER_18]: He led the team.

1320
02:14:44,022 --> 02:14:45,083
[SPEAKER_18]: And now he can't.

1321
02:14:46,405 --> 02:14:55,293
[SPEAKER_18]: He also won the Cooper Scholarship and the most prestigious award that a male athlete can receive in the federal court.

1322
02:14:55,353 --> 02:15:05,503
[SPEAKER_18]: I told Pat earlier we got an email from his other coach, Coach Baldino.

1323
02:15:06,970 --> 02:15:09,112
[SPEAKER_18]: Coach Valdini is coaching down in Florida.

1324
02:15:09,152 --> 02:15:13,094
[SPEAKER_18]: Yesterday it was 80 degrees down there and I hung up on him.

1325
02:15:14,215 --> 02:15:16,056
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is from Coach Valdini to Pat.

1326
02:15:16,076 --> 02:15:19,619
[SPEAKER_18]: I had the pleasure of being your football coach in high school in the 90s.

1327
02:15:20,199 --> 02:15:25,683
[SPEAKER_18]: You were a defensive back and running back, a fierce competitor, a man of very few words.

1328
02:15:27,338 --> 02:15:35,901
[SPEAKER_18]: That motivate goes around him by his work ethic and smile, but he was not possessed by the size or speed of a Division 1 athlete.

1329
02:15:36,301 --> 02:15:38,001
[SPEAKER_18]: He had a lion in his chest.

1330
02:15:40,882 --> 02:15:42,603
[SPEAKER_18]: One pet, one pet, sir.

1331
02:15:42,983 --> 02:15:50,225
[SPEAKER_18]: We were getting ready to play PB, and we actually died in the first place in PB.

1332
02:15:50,245 --> 02:15:55,447
[SPEAKER_18]: The next day, we had to go up to PB and try to win in a place that was very hostile to us.

1333
02:15:56,712 --> 02:16:01,393
[SPEAKER_18]: So we were practicing, and they use a lot of milk crates and footballs around the practice.

1334
02:16:02,113 --> 02:16:04,954
[SPEAKER_18]: And now he's running out to his position, but there's no crate.

1335
02:16:05,494 --> 02:16:09,975
[SPEAKER_18]: And one of his friends, which I don't know the name of, has decided to confront and tackle the football player.

1336
02:16:10,555 --> 02:16:12,775
[SPEAKER_18]: So he runs up behind him, tackles him, and down he goes.

1337
02:16:13,535 --> 02:16:15,476
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, he landed on the crate.

1338
02:16:16,316 --> 02:16:18,696
[SPEAKER_18]: The crate went through his cheek and out to the other side.

1339
02:16:18,716 --> 02:16:24,198
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a pretty gruesome injury, and at least the guy's almost fainted just looking at it.

1340
02:16:24,218 --> 02:16:26,098
[SPEAKER_18]: He had to get his seat from one side to the other.

1341
02:16:27,258 --> 02:16:30,999
[SPEAKER_18]: So we flash forward a little bit and now the team is ready to kill this guy.

1342
02:16:31,439 --> 02:16:35,680
[SPEAKER_18]: And they say, huh, when we beat Peabody with our best play, I'm not playing.

1343
02:16:36,241 --> 02:16:37,181
[SPEAKER_18]: So we go up to the hospital.

1344
02:16:37,221 --> 02:16:38,421
[SPEAKER_18]: His dad is up there.

1345
02:16:39,121 --> 02:16:40,422
[SPEAKER_18]: And he comes out.

1346
02:16:40,842 --> 02:16:41,822
[SPEAKER_18]: He's all swollen.

1347
02:16:42,102 --> 02:16:43,603
[SPEAKER_18]: Looks like a frankincense monster.

1348
02:16:43,623 --> 02:16:45,283
[SPEAKER_18]: He's got stitches on the outside.

1349
02:16:45,483 --> 02:16:50,545
[SPEAKER_18]: stitches on the inside, every way you could possibly put a stitch you have, all swollen up.

1350
02:16:51,085 --> 02:16:54,967
[SPEAKER_18]: And he said, Coach, are you going to play for tomorrow?

1351
02:16:55,207 --> 02:16:57,087
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's OK, Pat.

1352
02:16:57,868 --> 02:17:00,209
[SPEAKER_18]: That was a man of few words.

1353
02:17:00,229 --> 02:17:04,550
[SPEAKER_18]: When he sits on the event day, and I said, yeah, well, let's see.

1354
02:17:04,950 --> 02:17:07,711
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Coach, I'm going to tell you I can play for tomorrow.

1355
02:17:08,332 --> 02:17:10,232
[SPEAKER_18]: I said, well, let's see what happens tomorrow.

1356
02:17:10,252 --> 02:17:12,153
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I know we're going to see each other tomorrow.

1357
02:17:12,193 --> 02:17:13,854
[SPEAKER_18]: So the next day, I came in.

1358
02:17:15,195 --> 02:17:18,999
[SPEAKER_18]: I walked down to my room and there he is, sitting on the floor, and he gets up.

1359
02:17:19,019 --> 02:17:19,940
[SPEAKER_18]: Now it looks even worse.

1360
02:17:19,960 --> 02:17:27,768
[SPEAKER_18]: There were actions of black guys, and he was swallowing, and he said, oh, we're told you're taking part.

1361
02:17:27,808 --> 02:17:36,518
[SPEAKER_18]: So I went to the trainer just for the piece, and the trainer said, well, look, we've been thinking about this all night, and if you don't sign in first,

1362
02:17:39,483 --> 02:17:45,911
[SPEAKER_18]: He plays, gets three hits, wins the game, retires from first place, and now ladies and gentlemen,

1363
02:18:10,267 --> 02:18:13,168
All right, guys.

1364
02:18:13,468 --> 02:18:20,050
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you everyone for being here today.

1365
02:18:20,290 --> 02:18:32,574
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, the board for putting this event on, who knows how to work, and all of you for being here on a Sunday, taking this time to support all the inductees.

1366
02:18:32,594 --> 02:18:33,575
[SPEAKER_24]: It really means a lot to us.

1367
02:18:36,176 --> 02:18:39,297
[SPEAKER_24]: I've heard a lot of people talk about the blue and white in their veins or their blood.

1368
02:18:39,317 --> 02:18:40,857
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to share my personal story.

1369
02:18:41,318 --> 02:18:43,498
[SPEAKER_24]: It was right before the pep rally for Thanksgiving.

1370
02:18:44,278 --> 02:18:46,779
[SPEAKER_24]: Me and the other captains were walking down the hall.

1371
02:18:47,279 --> 02:18:49,880
[SPEAKER_24]: Bud Taylor, he was the athletic director, calls me.

1372
02:18:50,440 --> 02:18:51,080
[SPEAKER_24]: Scott, get in here.

1373
02:18:52,041 --> 02:18:52,701
[SPEAKER_24]: What do we do now?

1374
02:18:53,261 --> 02:18:54,721
[SPEAKER_24]: And roll up your sleeves.

1375
02:18:55,261 --> 02:18:57,802
[SPEAKER_24]: So we all just kind of looking around, what's he doing?

1376
02:18:58,162 --> 02:18:59,323
[SPEAKER_24]: So we roll up our sleeves.

1377
02:18:59,483 --> 02:19:00,843
[SPEAKER_24]: He pulls out a blue sharpie.

1378
02:19:01,203 --> 02:19:03,924
[SPEAKER_24]: It starts drawing all over our arms, and then it takes some white out of it.

1379
02:19:05,785 --> 02:19:11,389
[SPEAKER_24]: And then, once you get into the pepper alley, he calls us up, he's like, these boys really have a glue in my veins.

1380
02:19:12,430 --> 02:19:16,173
[SPEAKER_24]: And we're sitting there, we thought it was silly at the time, but we understand now.

1381
02:19:16,713 --> 02:19:21,697
[SPEAKER_24]: So my dad talks about that all the time, at least once a year, he brings it up.

1382
02:19:22,197 --> 02:19:25,920
[SPEAKER_24]: And once you're a Mustang, you really do have that feeling.

1383
02:19:28,664 --> 02:19:30,025
[SPEAKER_24]: A couple people I want to thank.

1384
02:19:30,065 --> 02:19:30,885
[SPEAKER_24]: There's three big things.

1385
02:19:30,965 --> 02:19:38,850
[SPEAKER_24]: I know all the other conductees have been doing basically the same thing today, but first group of people is just my friends and all the kids around the neighborhood that I grew up with.

1386
02:19:39,530 --> 02:19:45,194
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't tell you how many thousands of games of stickball we played just at the Wesleyan School Yard, Dane School Yard.

1387
02:19:45,714 --> 02:19:50,477
[SPEAKER_24]: How many games of tag football or tackle football we played down at Spicey Park.

1388
02:19:51,577 --> 02:19:54,098
[SPEAKER_24]: Basketball, battery car, that's all we did.

1389
02:19:54,399 --> 02:19:57,120
[SPEAKER_24]: There wasn't a grown up around us like Steve said.

1390
02:19:57,580 --> 02:20:00,201
[SPEAKER_24]: We did it ourselves and those guys kind of shaped me.

1391
02:20:00,241 --> 02:20:09,786
[SPEAKER_24]: A lot of those guys I got to play with in high school and it was really cool to take what we had practiced on our own and eventually make it up to play for the Los Angeles.

1392
02:20:10,628 --> 02:20:15,673
[SPEAKER_24]: Second group is all coaches, Coach McIntyre, thank you for the war stories.

1393
02:20:15,733 --> 02:20:25,664
[SPEAKER_24]: It really wasn't a war, it was a little injury, but like the Veterans Day just happened, those were the real kind of war stories to hear about.

1394
02:20:25,724 --> 02:20:29,868
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you to all the veterans, especially my daddy, who let me as a coach.

1395
02:20:38,435 --> 02:20:42,840
[SPEAKER_24]: All my other coaches growing up, West Medford Little League, football.

1396
02:20:43,281 --> 02:20:46,745
[SPEAKER_24]: I always had good, positive coaches that made me want to play and get a lot of fun.

1397
02:20:47,868 --> 02:20:54,011
[SPEAKER_24]: You hear crazy stories about some of the coaches out there and how intense they are, and they take all the fun out of it for the kids.

1398
02:20:54,031 --> 02:20:55,392
[SPEAKER_24]: I never had that.

1399
02:20:55,932 --> 02:21:01,695
[SPEAKER_24]: And hopefully, I've been helping out coaching my own boys, baseball, basketball team, and stuff.

1400
02:21:02,156 --> 02:21:06,478
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to give them some of that same experience that I got from my coaches at the younger grades.

1401
02:21:06,498 --> 02:21:13,261
[SPEAKER_24]: And then at the high school, Coach Mattel, freshman coaches, Coach Shire, Coach Muscarella,

1402
02:21:15,122 --> 02:21:24,687
[SPEAKER_24]: Counting aside, Coach Smith was a big influential person in my life, just kind of teaching that self-discipline and always being there on time, always doing a good job.

1403
02:21:26,948 --> 02:21:29,090
[SPEAKER_24]: Coach Pellini, definitely means a lot.

1404
02:21:29,890 --> 02:21:33,292
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for getting the words from him.

1405
02:21:33,412 --> 02:21:35,173
[SPEAKER_24]: One day in practice, I was going to need one.

1406
02:21:36,097 --> 02:21:42,085
[SPEAKER_24]: As a sophomore on the scout team, I was running the ball, and the defense, the starting defense wasn't able to stop the play.

1407
02:21:42,505 --> 02:21:44,928
[SPEAKER_24]: So Coach Valdini decided, you know what?

1408
02:21:45,028 --> 02:21:46,069
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to show him what's up.

1409
02:21:46,090 --> 02:21:48,052
[SPEAKER_24]: He got in position at linebacker.

1410
02:21:48,673 --> 02:21:53,158
[SPEAKER_24]: I hit the hole, and he came at me, and I took it out.

1411
02:21:53,519 --> 02:21:54,059
[SPEAKER_24]: It was crazy.

1412
02:21:55,700 --> 02:21:58,943
[SPEAKER_24]: But it's still a memory that me and my friends, that's what we have.

1413
02:21:59,003 --> 02:21:59,383
[SPEAKER_24]: He was in it.

1414
02:22:00,804 --> 02:22:03,647
[SPEAKER_24]: Hopefully, he's not working here.

1415
02:22:03,727 --> 02:22:05,288
[SPEAKER_24]: He's not going to be here.

1416
02:22:05,308 --> 02:22:06,129
[SPEAKER_24]: I know this team.

1417
02:22:06,169 --> 02:22:07,030
[SPEAKER_24]: I know this team.

1418
02:22:08,631 --> 02:22:10,833
[SPEAKER_24]: Last group is my family.

1419
02:22:10,853 --> 02:22:14,316
[SPEAKER_24]: I have two tables of people who came here today on Sunday.

1420
02:22:14,336 --> 02:22:16,517
[SPEAKER_24]: It means so much to me that you guys are here.

1421
02:22:18,088 --> 02:22:19,430
[SPEAKER_24]: My grandfather, he's not with us.

1422
02:22:19,470 --> 02:22:22,595
[SPEAKER_24]: He probably didn't miss a game when I played whether it was home or away.

1423
02:22:22,615 --> 02:22:26,722
[SPEAKER_24]: He would have been here to lend a third for this and he would have stayed after.

1424
02:22:26,742 --> 02:22:29,807
[SPEAKER_24]: This would have been his thing.

1425
02:22:29,827 --> 02:22:31,309
[SPEAKER_24]: He's hopefully watching this today.

1426
02:22:32,534 --> 02:22:39,820
[SPEAKER_24]: My parents, Tim, Barney, you can put the weight here, could have been blessed with more supportive parents.

1427
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:42,722
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I used to get rides from them.

1428
02:22:42,742 --> 02:22:55,033
[SPEAKER_24]: My dad had a big brown van and he would pick up five or six kids and drive them from Carr Park in North Midford down to South Midford to West Midford and back home, drop everyone off, never complained about it.

1429
02:22:56,194 --> 02:22:58,916
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you guys so much for all you did for me.

1430
02:22:58,977 --> 02:23:01,459
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank all of you for being here today.

1431
02:23:01,479 --> 02:23:03,541
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate it.

1432
02:23:38,003 --> 02:24:02,675
[SPEAKER_15]: The next introduction will be made by Reagan Richard.

1433
02:24:11,879 --> 02:24:18,180
[SPEAKER_27]: I had the privilege of inducting Sam Colato into the Mustang College Band.

1434
02:24:18,200 --> 02:24:24,002
[SPEAKER_27]: I first met Sam during her sophomore year, which was my first year as the band coach at Bethlehem High School for soccer.

1435
02:24:25,382 --> 02:24:35,064
[SPEAKER_27]: It was late deja vu because Sam was more of a midfielder or forward and was being trained to play in the goalie position, which is exactly what happened to me back in high school.

1436
02:24:35,864 --> 02:24:37,384
[SPEAKER_27]: Did she want to play goalie?

1437
02:24:37,984 --> 02:24:38,665
[SPEAKER_27]: Absolutely not.

1438
02:24:39,305 --> 02:24:40,905
[SPEAKER_27]: Did I still make her play goalie?

1439
02:24:41,373 --> 02:24:41,954
[SPEAKER_27]: Absolutely.

1440
02:24:43,115 --> 02:24:46,517
[SPEAKER_27]: She frequently made me aware that this is not something she wanted to do.

1441
02:24:48,219 --> 02:24:51,401
[SPEAKER_27]: But Sam and I really, really formed a great relationship.

1442
02:24:51,782 --> 02:24:54,064
[SPEAKER_27]: And she put work in at each and every practice.

1443
02:24:54,564 --> 02:24:56,706
[SPEAKER_27]: She realized that we needed a goalie.

1444
02:24:56,806 --> 02:24:59,568
[SPEAKER_27]: And as a softball term, she stepped up to the plate.

1445
02:25:00,289 --> 02:25:01,850
[SPEAKER_27]: We went undefeated that year.

1446
02:25:01,970 --> 02:25:05,193
[SPEAKER_27]: And a lot of that credit goes to Sam and the heart she brought to that team.

1447
02:25:06,834 --> 02:25:09,957
[SPEAKER_27]: One fond memory from soccer.

1448
02:25:10,904 --> 02:25:17,346
[SPEAKER_27]: Any coach who has coached a full bore Sam will definitely know what I'm talking about.

1449
02:25:19,027 --> 02:25:32,291
[SPEAKER_27]: I can still feel and see the look on her dad's face, that Tony look, even if I took Sam out of the game for a quick water break, just to kind of let me know why is my daughter not on the field.

1450
02:25:40,152 --> 02:25:47,415
[SPEAKER_27]: Before being Sam's coach, I was fortunate to watch many of her varsity ice hockey games at LaPonte because I knew many of the other girls on the team.

1451
02:25:48,036 --> 02:25:54,178
[SPEAKER_27]: Girls ice hockey was unique because middle school players could get a waiver to play so they had enough players on the team.

1452
02:25:54,859 --> 02:25:57,620
[SPEAKER_27]: So Sam is a member of the varsity team starting in 8th grade.

1453
02:25:58,280 --> 02:26:04,803
[SPEAKER_27]: Many of us in this room know the dedication, commitment, and hard work it takes to be a part of a varsity team.

1454
02:26:05,584 --> 02:26:08,405
[SPEAKER_27]: And to do that even before starting high school is very impressive.

1455
02:26:09,209 --> 02:26:13,412
[SPEAKER_27]: She was a powerhouse on the ice, becoming one of the first three players with 100 points.

1456
02:26:13,932 --> 02:26:15,793
[SPEAKER_27]: It was a true joy to watch her escape.

1457
02:26:16,834 --> 02:26:21,077
[SPEAKER_27]: Although I was her soccer coach, it was clear to everyone that her passion was softball.

1458
02:26:21,757 --> 02:26:29,142
[SPEAKER_27]: During her freshman year, she was able to play alongside her sister Nicole, who shifted over to shortstop, while Sam played the hot corner at third base.

1459
02:26:29,382 --> 02:26:32,724
[SPEAKER_27]: Out on the softball field is where Sam was meant to be.

1460
02:26:33,504 --> 02:26:37,407
[SPEAKER_27]: She had laser focus from the first pitch of every game to the last of that.

1461
02:26:38,254 --> 02:26:46,060
[SPEAKER_27]: She was a smart player, a great hitter, and an even better fielder, but it was her pumping up her teammates that meant the most to all of them.

1462
02:26:47,180 --> 02:26:53,805
[SPEAKER_27]: As a senior and as a captain, Sam's team went on to win the JBL championship for the first time in many years.

1463
02:26:54,986 --> 02:26:57,728
[SPEAKER_27]: Sam continues to make me proud in everything that she does.

1464
02:26:58,228 --> 02:27:02,972
[SPEAKER_27]: She went on to play softball at Bridgewater State and had a very successful career with that team.

1465
02:27:03,917 --> 02:27:15,267
[SPEAKER_27]: After graduating with a bachelor's in elementary education, she went on to get her master's in elementary education from UMass Boston and is now a third grade teacher in a Boston school.

1466
02:27:16,188 --> 02:27:18,630
[SPEAKER_27]: Dempsey mentioned that Sam is a great dancer.

1467
02:27:19,310 --> 02:27:21,132
[SPEAKER_27]: I will add that she is also a great singer.

1468
02:27:57,953 --> 02:27:58,093
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi.

1469
02:27:58,193 --> 02:28:03,416
[SPEAKER_23]: I would first like to thank Meg for that awesome speech.

1470
02:28:04,076 --> 02:28:09,678
[SPEAKER_23]: And for everyone at the Mustang Hall of Fame organization for creating this event.

1471
02:28:11,459 --> 02:28:14,320
[SPEAKER_23]: I am with Tia and Madi, public speakers, so.

1472
02:28:17,602 --> 02:28:20,463
[SPEAKER_23]: What I think of being a Mustang, I think of some of the happiest days.

1473
02:28:20,483 --> 02:28:24,965
[SPEAKER_23]: I think of going into the summer of sophomore year, dragging my bag,

1474
02:28:25,926 --> 02:28:31,287
[SPEAKER_23]: from store to store to find volleyball shoes, because I was going to play volleyball.

1475
02:28:32,528 --> 02:28:41,050
[SPEAKER_23]: The night before, I decided to head to the soccer field, where I met Meg, and I am so grateful for that.

1476
02:28:41,650 --> 02:28:45,131
[SPEAKER_23]: So then I headed into year two of hockey.

1477
02:28:45,251 --> 02:28:55,053
[SPEAKER_23]: Like Meg said, I played in eighth grade, so I went into year two with Coach McCarthy and Coach Forbes, who really shaped a lot of that team and really helped us go on to become a great

1478
02:28:57,551 --> 02:29:02,495
[SPEAKER_23]: Then landing a spot on the varsity softball team where I got to play alongside Nicole, which was a great honor.

1479
02:29:02,515 --> 02:29:06,719
[SPEAKER_23]: She shifted to shortstop, like was mentioned, and I got to play third base.

1480
02:29:06,759 --> 02:29:09,961
[SPEAKER_23]: So playing on the same side as your sister was really cool.

1481
02:29:11,022 --> 02:29:14,145
[SPEAKER_23]: Following in the footsteps of Nicole was definitely not an easy task.

1482
02:29:14,962 --> 02:29:19,044
[SPEAKER_23]: She was a powerhouse academically, as well as athletically.

1483
02:29:19,444 --> 02:29:23,086
[SPEAKER_23]: Well known by admin, teachers, coaches.

1484
02:29:23,106 --> 02:29:27,269
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't really walk into a room at the time that my name wasn't already known.

1485
02:29:27,449 --> 02:29:31,351
[SPEAKER_23]: Probably not my first name, but definitely my last name.

1486
02:29:31,371 --> 02:29:41,476
[SPEAKER_23]: I will never forget winning the GVL in softball for the first time since 1998, or having an undefeated GVL season in hockey.

1487
02:29:42,201 --> 02:29:45,122
[SPEAKER_23]: and earning a bye to win the next round of the state tournament.

1488
02:29:45,142 --> 02:29:59,568
[SPEAKER_23]: I will definitely not forget pretending we were ninjas and putting flamingos on people's yards across Medford in hopes that they would support our upcoming season.

1489
02:30:01,149 --> 02:30:01,749
[SPEAKER_23]: Everything I do,

1490
02:30:04,439 --> 02:30:12,483
[SPEAKER_23]: I feel like there's just so many qualities that I've learned or have learned from Medford that I carry on into being a teacher today and everything I do in everyday life.

1491
02:30:12,503 --> 02:30:19,006
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to say thank you to my parents and my family.

1492
02:30:19,026 --> 02:30:21,627
[SPEAKER_23]: I've always had a great support system.

1493
02:30:21,907 --> 02:30:25,289
[SPEAKER_23]: We've had probably one of the biggest crowds at almost every sporting event.

1494
02:30:26,670 --> 02:30:30,972
[SPEAKER_23]: When I earned my 100th point in hockey, I had family members there with a sign that was

1495
02:30:31,645 --> 02:30:32,966
[SPEAKER_23]: somehow lit up.

1496
02:30:33,306 --> 02:30:37,429
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not sure how that works.

1497
02:30:37,709 --> 02:30:52,959
[SPEAKER_23]: So a great combination of my parents and sports really taught me how to make a commitment and stick with it, how to be dedicated, motivated, and grounded in everything I do, and that I could succeed at Medford, at Bridgewater, and now as a teacher.

1498
02:30:54,800 --> 02:31:00,424
[SPEAKER_23]: I love being a Mustang, and I hope to one day be a Mustang here and also be a coach

1499
02:31:01,345 --> 02:31:04,247
[SPEAKER_23]: first upcoming Hall of Fame athlete.

1500
02:31:05,748 --> 02:31:20,858
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, I'd like to say thank you to everyone here, to my family and parents for driving me to all my games and being there at every game, supporting me, whether it wasn't a great game or it was a great game, you were always there, day in and day out.

1501
02:31:35,610 --> 02:31:36,931
The next introduction will be made by Michael Morgan.

1502
02:32:16,016 --> 02:32:17,197
Thank you, everyone.

1503
02:32:17,217 --> 02:32:25,882
[SPEAKER_22]: When John's brother, Dan, called me and asked if I would introduce John, my first reaction was, let me check the Patriot schedule.

1504
02:32:26,383 --> 02:32:30,405
[SPEAKER_22]: And I saw they were on a buy, and I said nothing could keep me away.

1505
02:32:31,766 --> 02:32:40,372
[SPEAKER_22]: So I am here today to introduce John Costello, this year's inductee to the Medford Mustang Hall of Fame for the category of Community Service.

1506
02:32:42,021 --> 02:32:50,264
[SPEAKER_22]: My wife and I first met the Costello family in 2009 when we served together as board members on the Mustang Football Booster Club.

1507
02:32:51,844 --> 02:33:01,887
[SPEAKER_22]: As a student athlete, John witnessed firsthand what the volunteer members of the Booster Club did to support the football program and how much they did for the kids.

1508
02:33:02,828 --> 02:33:03,868
[SPEAKER_22]: It was always for the kids.

1509
02:33:05,262 --> 02:33:10,246
[SPEAKER_22]: When I first met John, he was a young college student who was not far removed from high school himself.

1510
02:33:10,346 --> 02:33:17,411
[SPEAKER_22]: It was a pleasure to work with him and witness him taking on more responsibility as a member of the Booster Club.

1511
02:33:18,672 --> 02:33:32,123
[SPEAKER_22]: John eventually became president of the Senior Football Associates and worked very hard to ensure the same experiences he and his teammates had as Medford football players were available to the student athlete who followed him.

1512
02:33:33,283 --> 02:33:39,125
[SPEAKER_22]: It was genuinely enjoyable to see such dedication to service from a young adult.

1513
02:33:40,426 --> 02:33:44,987
[SPEAKER_22]: John worked many years committed to serving the team that meant so much to him in high school.

1514
02:33:45,788 --> 02:34:00,493
[SPEAKER_22]: Whether it was managing the pregame meals, coordinating fundraisers, working the concession on a sometimes cold and rainy Friday night, or planning the Thanksgiving Eve dinner or the year-end banquet, John was there to make sure everything ran smoothly behind the scenes.

1515
02:34:01,864 --> 02:34:08,047
[SPEAKER_22]: He served as the main point of contact between the coaching staff and the board to make sure we did everything to get the team whatever they needed.

1516
02:34:08,067 --> 02:34:13,969
[SPEAKER_22]: Throughout his seven years of service, John never sought praise or thanks for what he did.

1517
02:34:13,989 --> 02:34:18,971
[SPEAKER_22]: He has remained humble and simply wanted to give back to the Mustangs.

1518
02:34:20,212 --> 02:34:29,436
[SPEAKER_22]: It is with much respect that I introduce the 2018 Community Service Inductee to the Medford Mustang Hall of Fame,

1519
02:34:52,680 --> 02:34:53,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you Mike.

1520
02:34:54,121 --> 02:35:01,524
[SPEAKER_08]: First I want to begin by saying thank you to the Mustang Hall of Fame for recognizing me for my community service today and also holding this in the Patriots flag.

1521
02:35:01,544 --> 02:35:04,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations to all the inductees here today as well.

1522
02:35:05,886 --> 02:35:10,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you to my parents for raising me to learn the importance of taking the time to give back to your community.

1523
02:35:11,589 --> 02:35:16,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you to Ed Finn for taking the shot and nominating me as president of the Booster Club.

1524
02:35:17,807 --> 02:35:34,862
[SPEAKER_08]: A special thank you to all of the board members of the Metro Football Booster Club over the years, including Ed and Sandra Finn, who are like the bottom line of Krafton Metro Football, Mike and Elaine Booranger, John and Daria Petrella, Erika Marsh, even Chris Murphy, and so many others.

1525
02:35:35,703 --> 02:35:44,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Without all of you, the football team wouldn't have the new equipment team has to afford each and every game, an end of the year banquet, and so much more.

1526
02:35:44,865 --> 02:35:47,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Each of you should be standing at the podium today as well.

1527
02:35:48,906 --> 02:35:54,428
[SPEAKER_08]: And last but not least, thank you to everybody here today for actually staying to get community service support.

1528
02:36:11,033 --> 02:36:11,113
Okay.

1529
02:36:33,753 --> 02:36:35,454
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, I would like everyone to stand and give a round of applause to Megan.

1530
02:37:09,713 --> 02:37:11,075
[SPEAKER_15]: I've learned a lot about it and I am not surprised at its status.

1531
02:37:11,095 --> 02:37:11,335
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm honored.

1532
02:37:11,355 --> 02:37:12,757
[SPEAKER_15]: It's moving and it's refreshing and at such a high level of excellence.

1533
02:37:27,617 --> 02:37:42,566
[SPEAKER_15]: Second, thanks to all of you who came today, obviously for personal reasons, if you have someone that you know that went to the Hall of Fame, but especially the rest of the folks here who stayed to honor all of the athletes and community service folks.

1534
02:37:43,466 --> 02:37:46,028
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you very much.

1535
02:37:47,109 --> 02:37:56,114
[SPEAKER_15]: And almost finally, for the new members of the Hall of Fame, the Mustang Hall of Fame Class of 2018, please stand.
