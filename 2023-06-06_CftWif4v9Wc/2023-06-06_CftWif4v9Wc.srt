1
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:26,579
[SPEAKER_05]: will be as follows.

2
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:40,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Pursuant to Mass General Law 71, Section 38N, the Medford School Committee will convene a public hearing for members of the community interested in speaking either for or against, in whole or in part, the superintendent's recommended fiscal year 24 operating budget.

3
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:50,815
[SPEAKER_05]: The school administration will present an overview of the recommendations brought forth to the Medford School Committee through meetings of the regular school committee held on March 6th, 2023, March 20th, 2023, as well as the Committee of the Whole meetings

4
00:04:53,592 --> 00:05:02,758
[SPEAKER_05]: that took place on April 3rd, 2023, April 10th, 2023, and May 15th, 2023, in the formulation of the district's proposal of a budget request.

5
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:07,201
[SPEAKER_05]: That's submitted by Dr. Maurice-Edouard Vincent, our superintendent of schools.

6
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:08,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome everybody.

7
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:11,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll turn it over to you and two questions after that.

8
00:05:11,764 --> 00:05:12,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call, please.

9
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,041
[SPEAKER_05]: present, seven present, zero absent.

10
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:29,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll turn it over to Dr. Edward Vincent.

11
00:05:34,365 --> 00:05:36,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Cushing, are you able to start the deck?

12
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:37,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

13
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:43,449
[SPEAKER_02]: So good evening.

14
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:51,112
[SPEAKER_02]: This evening, I'm going to present a very short slide deck just to provide the budget update.

15
00:05:56,917 --> 00:06:02,548
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, this just shows the budget process and tentative timeline.

16
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:05,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we are at June 5.

17
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:16,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

18
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:36,001
[SPEAKER_02]: This evening's budget objectives, it's going to be the public, the official public budget hearing which we are statutorily required to do and listen to the public for any feedback and comments on the budget that will be presented.

19
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:52,477
[SPEAKER_02]: So our last meeting in May, on the 15th, the budget recommendation that I presented to the committee was $71,835,165.

20
00:06:52,737 --> 00:06:55,019
[SPEAKER_02]: This number came after a comprehensive budget review.

21
00:07:12,737 --> 00:07:19,520
[SPEAKER_02]: So this particular slide shows some of the recommended investments that the district made.

22
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:28,543
[SPEAKER_02]: We were tasked with looking at the budget and presenting a level budget of $71 million.

23
00:07:29,444 --> 00:07:32,765
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these recommended investments

24
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:38,349
[SPEAKER_02]: These were the key investments that totaled 480,000.

25
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:50,461
[SPEAKER_02]: The implementation of the Medford High School climate recommendations was a budget neutral recommendation, so there was no adjustment necessary.

26
00:07:51,882 --> 00:07:58,349
[SPEAKER_02]: We recommended the addition of two literacy coaches, a second PIC specialist,

27
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:05,951
[SPEAKER_02]: conversion of library aids to librarians, and 1.0 theater arts teacher.

28
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:18,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Our proposed ESSER balance at the last budget presentation was approximately $525,000 in a proposed balance that would remain with our ESSER funding.

29
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:40,703
[SPEAKER_02]: So in order to achieve the 71 million, we needed to look at the $835,000 differential.

30
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:50,750
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the previous slide where I showed the recommended investments, they totaled $480,000, which left us with a balance of $355,000, which

31
00:08:58,015 --> 00:09:00,116
[SPEAKER_02]: will be covered by sir.

32
00:09:00,996 --> 00:09:01,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide please.

33
00:09:05,237 --> 00:09:08,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Subtracting the 355,000, the 480 from the original 525,000 left us with 170,000.

34
00:09:20,229 --> 00:09:22,010
[SPEAKER_02]: The literacy coaches.

35
00:09:23,552 --> 00:09:31,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I put it in green, because we know that it's critically important for the implementation of the new literacy program.

36
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:42,149
[SPEAKER_02]: So we subtracted the 160,000 from that funding with so leaving us with a balance of 10,000 on so at this point in time.

37
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:52,750
[SPEAKER_02]: which brings us to the 71 million allocated amount.

38
00:09:54,171 --> 00:10:01,074
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am prepared to take any questions from the committee or the community.

39
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:04,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vinson.

40
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:06,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there other questions from the committee?

41
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:11,919
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Hays.

42
00:10:13,427 --> 00:10:13,828
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

43
00:10:14,388 --> 00:10:28,505
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to ask so the, the literacy, the two literacy coaches are being funded by Esther, or is it two additional that we can have the two literacy coaches there are two literacy coaches that we are recommending.

44
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:32,168
[SPEAKER_02]: for the implementation of the new program.

45
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:35,911
[SPEAKER_02]: And we landed on the two coaches.

46
00:10:37,132 --> 00:10:50,905
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a new program at the elementary level, and we would like to have one coach share two buildings so that the two literacy coaches would be between the four elementary schools.

47
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:55,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And although we had the recommended investments,

48
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:06,656
[SPEAKER_02]: we went back and subtracted those two coaches and added them back in under ESSER, which left us with the ESSER balance of $10,000.

49
00:11:07,196 --> 00:11:16,683
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are two coaches included in the recommendation of the $71 million balance.

50
00:11:16,703 --> 00:11:24,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I know that I'm kind of a broken record on this, but I wanna say again, that I feel very strongly that we need one at each building

51
00:11:25,515 --> 00:11:30,897
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was hoping at today's meeting, maybe we'd be coming forward with some suggestions of ways to find the money for that.

52
00:11:31,117 --> 00:11:45,462
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that, you know, as I've emailed a couple of times, we've had coaches or interventionists as a priority in the budget for at least the last two years prior to this year.

53
00:11:45,842 --> 00:11:47,403
[SPEAKER_16]: And each time they've been cut out.

54
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:50,884
[SPEAKER_16]: And this year with the new implementation of the new program,

55
00:11:52,051 --> 00:12:02,237
[SPEAKER_16]: I, you know, again, I just want to keep reiterating I think one each building is really necessary to get this program up and running the first time we've had a new program now and at least 10 years.

56
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:12,062
[SPEAKER_16]: So I was really hoping we'd be talking about whether there was a way to find some money just for this first year really to get the implementation going.

57
00:12:15,724 --> 00:12:15,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor.

58
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:17,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

59
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you and thank you to member Hays.

60
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:25,304
[SPEAKER_13]: This presentation is for our submission of 71.8 million.

61
00:12:26,164 --> 00:12:26,804
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a question.

62
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:30,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Or the 71 million that the mayor has said she would give us.

63
00:12:33,268 --> 00:12:37,951
[SPEAKER_02]: This presentation was just demonstrating how we would arrive at the 71 million.

64
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:42,033
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're not, we're not putting forward our recommendation.

65
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:49,078
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, because in past years we would put forward a recommendation for what we needed the mayor.

66
00:12:50,138 --> 00:13:04,422
[SPEAKER_13]: After we did that the mayor would tell us what we get, or before, and then we come back again and try to figure out how to get the number down, but we are never going to vote for the 71.8 million in the current plan or agendas that we have scheduled.

67
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:20,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the committee is going to give their recommendation I just was tasked with demonstrating how we would arrive at 71 million that that's all the slide deck represents.

68
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:23,785
[SPEAKER_13]: I have another question about this.

69
00:13:25,206 --> 00:13:28,449
[SPEAKER_13]: How many literacy coaches did the literacy program say we should have.

70
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:38,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from my member, this Lucy did have just a conflicting appointment.

71
00:13:39,595 --> 00:13:56,205
[SPEAKER_02]: But from the time when we originally started planning it had been to have two coaches in collaboration or in conjunction with the work that was happening with health for literacy where they would be providing additional professional development and additional support.

72
00:13:56,706 --> 00:13:57,348
[SPEAKER_02]: to the schools.

73
00:13:58,051 --> 00:14:01,684
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I know ideally the, the, the.

74
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:26,332
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the more support that you're able to provide one coach per building was one of the proposed recommendations but we were prepared to implement the new program with two coaches and working with health literacy where they would be sending their experts to also come in and support the instruction at the schools.

75
00:14:26,972 --> 00:14:27,333
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

76
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:30,835
[SPEAKER_13]: And one last question before I stop taking all the question time.

77
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:35,764
[SPEAKER_13]: The slide we saw said 71.8 million.

78
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:37,705
[SPEAKER_13]: Did we see a slide that said the other number?

79
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:38,966
[SPEAKER_02]: 71 million?

80
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:39,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

81
00:14:39,627 --> 00:14:40,547
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the last slide.

82
00:14:40,827 --> 00:14:41,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, sorry.

83
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:45,109
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have the slides myself, so I couldn't return to them.

84
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,371
[SPEAKER_13]: I have plenty more questions, but I'll let other members ask.

85
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:50,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you, members.

86
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:55,435
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I may, from the chair, just because this first presentation for myself too, it's 71 plus the 525,000, or 515,000.

87
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:56,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that correct?

88
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:56,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

89
00:15:10,236 --> 00:15:10,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information.

90
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:18,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

91
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:29,280
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just wanted to be clear on that just make sure I was clear, but member so that that is a not a factual statement our budget includes lots of other monies that we are not voting on.

92
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:45,677
[SPEAKER_13]: The word budget refers to the allocation request from the city, only that we do not include our special ed funding we get the year later we do not include transportation assistance, and just like those other grants for title one we do not include answer.

93
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:49,359
[SPEAKER_13]: So our budget is not for 71 plus something.

94
00:15:49,819 --> 00:15:54,080
[SPEAKER_13]: It is whatever number will appear in the city budget, and it will definitely not include.

95
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,502
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe our actual according to DC our budget, our total spending is $84 million a year.

96
00:15:59,923 --> 00:16:01,663
[SPEAKER_13]: when you add all those other things in.

97
00:16:02,203 --> 00:16:13,925
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's not accurate to say that our budget will be anything bigger than the 71, because my understanding of the word budget in this context legally does not include any grants of any sort.

98
00:16:16,206 --> 00:16:16,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, member Rousseau.

99
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

100
00:16:20,107 --> 00:16:20,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

101
00:16:20,627 --> 00:16:24,687
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there's two things happening, right?

102
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:27,988
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to, as a committee, coalesce around

103
00:16:28,932 --> 00:16:30,893
[SPEAKER_03]: request to the municipal government.

104
00:16:31,553 --> 00:16:43,658
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's one thing that's happening but I think separately, we also asked the superintendent for some clarity around what would it look like if we had to get to $71 million.

105
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:46,980
[SPEAKER_03]: So, on item number two, I have a couple of questions.

106
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,061
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the our the budget you recommended was 71 835 165.

107
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:08,685
[SPEAKER_03]: two ELA coaches, a specialist in the Parent Information Center, converting the library aids to librarians, and one FTE for theater at the high school.

108
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:23,373
[SPEAKER_03]: So within the 71.8 and change, there was $480,000 that represents new things that we will do next year, which is in addition to other new things we're gonna do next year that are outside of the operating budget because they're gonna be funded by ESSER.

109
00:17:23,413 --> 00:17:25,574
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've talked about that in prior presentations.

110
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:49,435
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think my question is, I am a little confused, but when you say total deductions based on FY24 recommendations, the slide said 835,000, which is basically like the discrepancy between what you recommended and the $71 million that the mayor's previously indicated, right?

111
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:50,936
[SPEAKER_03]: But then minus 480,

112
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:56,920
[SPEAKER_03]: which is essentially the new things that we're going to do under the budget.

113
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,800
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says $355,000 to be covered by ESSER.

114
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,201
[SPEAKER_03]: So 835 minus 480, 355.

115
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:04,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I think my question is like, are we, so we're assuming then that we, of the $525,000 left in ESSER, that we can identify $355,000

116
00:18:22,406 --> 00:18:26,771
[SPEAKER_03]: in operating expenses that could be paid for by sir is that true.

117
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:26,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

118
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so for that 355,000, we were looking at five FTS that were on the budget

119
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:50,310
[SPEAKER_02]: five open positions at approximately 70,000 per FTE.

120
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:59,456
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was where we were transferring those five additional positions to go on to ESSER.

121
00:19:00,196 --> 00:19:02,898
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was where, so the 355,000, when you subtracted that from 525,

122
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:09,623
[SPEAKER_02]: You had $170,000.

123
00:19:09,723 --> 00:19:13,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Then from the $170,000 balance, tentative balance, we also went back in and added the two ELA coaches.

124
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,331
[SPEAKER_02]: which were 160,000.

125
00:19:28,451 --> 00:19:36,438
[SPEAKER_02]: So that left us with a balance of 10,000 left on ESSER for FY 25.

126
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:39,801
[SPEAKER_02]: So we almost zeroed ESSER out.

127
00:19:40,421 --> 00:19:40,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.

128
00:19:41,142 --> 00:19:45,366
[SPEAKER_03]: And what are the five FTEs that are moving out of the operating budget and into ESSER?

129
00:19:46,132 --> 00:19:50,213
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have like, these are all open positions.

130
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:57,836
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a BCBA, we have an adjustment counselor, I wanna say at the McGlynn Elementary School.

131
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:02,637
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a few teaching positions, world language position.

132
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:07,518
[SPEAKER_02]: So there were like three positions at the high school.

133
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:14,240
[SPEAKER_02]: One was a district-wide BCBA, an adjustment counselor at an elementary school, and then three,

134
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:19,625
[SPEAKER_02]: three teaching positions at the high school.

135
00:20:20,305 --> 00:20:25,010
[SPEAKER_03]: And are those positions permissible under ESSER rules to be covered by ESSER?

136
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:28,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they would be able to be covered by ESSER.

137
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:33,819
[SPEAKER_03]: And is that because we perceive that they are one year expenditures?

138
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:38,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Or that they are needed because of the pandemic?

139
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:48,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that we're already paying for BCBAs and adjustment counselors on ESSER, so we're saying we're adding more BCBAs and adjustment counselors to ESSER.

140
00:20:49,604 --> 00:20:59,349
[SPEAKER_03]: But the language teachers sort of surprised me because I don't, I'm not sure if they are needed positions in a continuous way, how do they apply to ESSER?

141
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how do they qualify, I guess is my question.

142
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:21,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say students who, for ESSER, if we're able to demonstrate that it's addressing cell, social-emotional learning needs, bringing joy or support to students, you are able to demonstrate that.

143
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:27,984
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we did though was look at open positions and not filled positions.

144
00:21:28,044 --> 00:21:29,285
[SPEAKER_02]: So those, there were five,

145
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:33,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just kind of worked out with the math.

146
00:21:35,008 --> 00:21:36,309
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we got to that number.

147
00:21:36,969 --> 00:21:43,192
[SPEAKER_03]: So then what we're saying is, out of the 525,000, 355 can be used to pay for these five positions.

148
00:21:43,212 --> 00:21:43,872
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's 355 out of the 835.

149
00:21:59,144 --> 00:22:08,887
[SPEAKER_03]: that can be covered by ESSER and that leaves $170,000 which also allows us to cover two coaches, two ELA coaches.

150
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:10,007
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's 160.

151
00:22:10,047 --> 00:22:14,588
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you take the 480 of the new minus 160, there's still $320,000 of recommended investments listed here.

152
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:15,929
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that

153
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:35,302
[SPEAKER_03]: So for it and that would include the PIC specialist converting the library aids and the theater teacher.

154
00:22:35,782 --> 00:22:38,022
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where $320,000 comes from.

155
00:22:38,502 --> 00:22:47,185
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think what I am not clear on is how is the $320,000 going to be paid for if you're saying that's how we would get to 71?

156
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:48,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think there's still $320,000 unpaid.

157
00:22:48,865 --> 00:22:51,606
[SPEAKER_03]: So is it really 71 or is it 71, 320 that we have gotten to?

158
00:23:01,064 --> 00:23:04,387
[SPEAKER_02]: we were cutting and seeing if there were just creative ways to.

159
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,932
[SPEAKER_03]: So meaning we would not do those things.

160
00:23:11,363 --> 00:23:11,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

161
00:23:11,903 --> 00:23:19,047
[SPEAKER_03]: We would not get a theater teacher, we would not get a pick specialist, and we would not convert our life library aids to librarians.

162
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:23,670
[SPEAKER_03]: That is how you would get to 7100 71 million.

163
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right, that is correct.

164
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:26,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

165
00:23:26,731 --> 00:23:27,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

166
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:28,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm with you now.

167
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:35,316
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think, you know, in terms of the two things that we have to do tonight.

168
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:44,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly talking about what our request municipal government is going to be as a committee, I think, is really important, but I also think.

169
00:23:45,806 --> 00:23:51,569
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, considering with clarity that that the way that we would get to $71 million would mean.

170
00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:15,389
[SPEAKER_03]: creating a scheduling issue at the elementary school level, because my understanding was that library block changing was a requirement to make the scheduling work next year at the elementary school, that we would have to find some other way to offer theater programming next year or not offer it at all, and that the pick would continue to be understaffed.

171
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:16,510
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think

172
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:42,812
[SPEAKER_03]: when we get to the part and I for me, I think I would like to talk about one and then the other if we could when we get to deliberation after we hear from the community but those are those are significant trade-offs and those are significant things we would not be able to do in order to get to that $71 million and II know you know that but I'm just trying to make sure I we're all clear on what getting to $71 million looks like and also to say

173
00:24:46,633 --> 00:25:10,578
[SPEAKER_03]: using ESSER money and now we're going to go up to 33 people so we have 33 staff members being paid for by grant funding that will not be there next year and that is a that is a huge number so we need to be mindful of the impact and we may not have a choice this year but the impact of that is just kicking the can down the road and

174
00:25:11,604 --> 00:25:22,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I think my committee members know, my fellow colleagues know that I hate doing that because I think it just sets up problems that are bigger than just, you know, delaying one year.

175
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:26,153
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to thank you for that.

176
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:30,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to make sure I was clear about what everything said as it stepped out.

177
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:35,219
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look forward to hearing from the community.

178
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:35,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

179
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:44,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau?

180
00:25:45,275 --> 00:25:45,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

181
00:25:47,136 --> 00:25:52,080
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm still confused by the exact wording.

182
00:25:53,281 --> 00:26:00,367
[SPEAKER_13]: It says that we're going to implement the recommendations from Mr. Welch and that it's budget neutral.

183
00:26:00,547 --> 00:26:08,013
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm looking at the recommendations right now, including a 0.5 FTE Dean position,

184
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:21,226
[SPEAKER_13]: the addition of an associate principal, the addition of four permanent substitute teachers.

185
00:26:21,506 --> 00:26:24,308
[SPEAKER_13]: So these would be, you know, full-time teachers.

186
00:26:24,968 --> 00:26:26,609
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody can find a substitute, I get that.

187
00:26:27,148 --> 00:26:37,297
[SPEAKER_13]: But an actual teacher just in the teacher roles on the actual schedule as a teacher is a different, different thing to try to recruit for than a substitute.

188
00:26:37,317 --> 00:26:40,980
[SPEAKER_13]: So, all of those add up to an awful lot of money.

189
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:49,047
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not sure how we can say that's budget neutral unless we're just not doing the recommendations from Mr. Welch for which we spent a good amount of money to get.

190
00:26:50,287 --> 00:27:04,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so currently right now in the budget, we were allocated the high school had three ISS is or building based substitutes that were allocated for and under.

191
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,013
[SPEAKER_02]: The proposed structure from Mr. Welch.

192
00:27:10,474 --> 00:27:15,799
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a principal associate principal and three assistant principal roles.

193
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently we have a principal.

194
00:27:19,442 --> 00:27:25,328
[SPEAKER_02]: We have four assistant principals that work within the high school.

195
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:31,332
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also have Principal Fallon on the vocational side.

196
00:27:31,933 --> 00:27:46,464
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we were saying it was budget neutral, even though there was a recommendation of an associate principal, it was still four adults, four additional principals, associate or assistant principals, supporting the structure.

197
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:51,928
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was still the same total number of people, just

198
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,392
[SPEAKER_02]: One was given a different title.

199
00:27:55,812 --> 00:28:02,102
[SPEAKER_02]: So the title of associate principal doesn't currently exist within the structure that we have.

200
00:28:03,364 --> 00:28:06,068
[SPEAKER_02]: We have principles and then we have assistant principals.

201
00:28:09,614 --> 00:28:18,096
[SPEAKER_02]: As it stands right now where when we said it was budget neutral we're still maintaining the same number of supporting adult supportive adults.

202
00:28:18,616 --> 00:28:23,798
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was where the budget neutral language was recommended.

203
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:26,458
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the dean position.

204
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:27,979
[SPEAKER_02]: We are.

205
00:28:30,313 --> 00:28:54,261
[SPEAKER_02]: As we've been looking at the structure that we currently have in the supports that we were giving to schools and getting feedback from principals in terms of how we have been using some of our existing positions such as engagement specialists, the Dean position, we were creatively looking at

206
00:28:56,371 --> 00:29:03,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Expanding either the job description and working with our engagement specialists that also work with the schools.

207
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:07,405
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have an engagement specialist down at the.

208
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:22,167
[SPEAKER_02]: middle school levels and those administrators in meeting and working with them, we said that we're going to look at reallocation and they were in full support of that.

209
00:29:23,087 --> 00:29:31,331
[SPEAKER_02]: That when they need additional support, they would request the additional support based on the structures at the existing schools.

210
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:35,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was why when you saw

211
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:56,318
[SPEAKER_02]: budget neutral or cost neutral for the high school, we felt that we could, we could get there, we could get fairly close to the recommended proposal but in terms of the amount of administrators, we would not be reducing the total number of administrators assigned to the high school.

212
00:29:57,554 --> 00:29:57,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

213
00:29:58,214 --> 00:30:00,475
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also want to just share my concerns about.

214
00:30:02,276 --> 00:30:08,459
[SPEAKER_13]: We are in, we are purposefully increasing our fiscal cliff, one year before the cliff at the beginning of the pandemic.

215
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:15,162
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a lot of like the federal government just seemed to have a blank check.

216
00:30:16,102 --> 00:30:21,245
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it was years away when we were going to be in full blown walking off the cliff.

217
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:28,409
[SPEAKER_13]: We are well we're 12 months away from walking off the cliff, and we're going to make it a higher cliff.

218
00:30:31,465 --> 00:30:36,368
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not saying we shouldn't add those other five, and that we shouldn't use our extra funds for that purpose.

219
00:30:36,928 --> 00:30:43,813
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm saying those should be in our operating budget to additional literacy coaches should be in our operating budget.

220
00:30:44,373 --> 00:30:52,198
[SPEAKER_13]: And frankly, an awful lot of other people that currently work for us that are in most of the districts operating budget employees.

221
00:30:53,378 --> 00:30:58,941
[SPEAKER_13]: that we're just pretending aren't going to somehow ever have to become part of our operating budget.

222
00:31:01,082 --> 00:31:06,806
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just closing our eyes and being like, well, next July is going to be terrible.

223
00:31:06,826 --> 00:31:11,108
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you know something as bad as coming.

224
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,262
[SPEAKER_13]: doing nothing about it is different than when something bad happens at the beginning of the pandemic.

225
00:31:17,003 --> 00:31:17,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody was prepared.

226
00:31:18,763 --> 00:31:38,893
[SPEAKER_13]: And how well, maybe we could have some of there could have been some preparations but here we are 12 full months, and we're going to approve a budget, adding to the fiscal cliff, up to 33 and a half people who will either be laid off or some magical thing will somehow make 33 people

227
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:42,493
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not $100,000.

228
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:43,613
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not a million dollars.

229
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:45,794
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what it is, but it's a lot of money.

230
00:31:47,675 --> 00:31:53,518
[SPEAKER_13]: And our normal annual increases are going to come anyways.

231
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:57,740
[SPEAKER_13]: The teacher's contract is for 3%, I believe, in the next year.

232
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:00,462
[SPEAKER_13]: We have other contracts that are going to increase.

233
00:32:01,222 --> 00:32:04,804
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is all in addition to the 33 and a half people.

234
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:11,181
[SPEAKER_13]: That we are all going to sit around this table and say we don't want to get rid of because they're all important.

235
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:15,322
[SPEAKER_13]: So, there are solutions.

236
00:32:16,263 --> 00:32:24,226
[SPEAKER_13]: The solutions all expire on December 31 and override before then would allow the mayor to start including that money in our budget next July 1.

237
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:29,809
[SPEAKER_13]: When December 31 arrives, those people had better be looking for new employment.

238
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,271
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't I mean.

239
00:32:35,751 --> 00:32:36,552
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really insane.

240
00:32:37,572 --> 00:32:44,396
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just, I just find it fascinating that there's a massive free cash in City Hall.

241
00:32:45,837 --> 00:32:51,681
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're going to not even fund the meager improvements to the district we want to as a committee.

242
00:32:52,922 --> 00:33:02,207
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're just gonna like sail along at full speed right off the edge of that cliff, as if there are not, aside from the employees that are impacted.

243
00:33:03,658 --> 00:33:07,120
[SPEAKER_13]: There are no employees working in our school district who are not impacting our kids.

244
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:22,488
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, all I care very much about the employees, we really get elected for the kids, and all of the needs being met by those employees are just going to stop being met because there's no creative way to take 33 and a half people's

245
00:33:23,476 --> 00:33:28,598
[SPEAKER_13]: full-time employment and just shove it onto other people and think that the work will get done.

246
00:33:29,499 --> 00:33:32,200
[SPEAKER_13]: We've sort of been doing that in Medford for a very long time.

247
00:33:33,181 --> 00:33:41,304
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm deeply disappointed in 71 million, 71.8 million would not be satisfying.

248
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:49,148
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be, in my mind, a minimum to not making the problem worse next year.

249
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:50,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

250
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:52,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

251
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,230
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may, from the chair.

252
00:33:55,002 --> 00:34:11,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to point out a few things from your comments, because I do think we are planning as best we can on the city side, especially because the school's ESSER funding runs out at least six months prior to ARPA funding.

253
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:17,722
[SPEAKER_05]: We are plugging the entire gap with the ESSER funds because they need to be spent.

254
00:34:17,802 --> 00:34:19,464
[SPEAKER_05]: They can only have the summer of 2024.

255
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,587
[SPEAKER_05]: and then they will run out.

256
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:30,472
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do know that we're using about 3 million of outside funding through ESSER for the entire budget, schools, city side.

257
00:34:30,732 --> 00:34:33,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about it as a collective whole.

258
00:34:33,594 --> 00:34:41,339
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why on the city side, we've made very tough choices and we are not using any ARPA funding for revenue loss.

259
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:45,241
[SPEAKER_05]: There are, like you said, positions that are being funded through ARPA.

260
00:34:45,662 --> 00:34:48,984
[SPEAKER_05]: We're making sure we don't use, we're not doing

261
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,864
[SPEAKER_05]: more spending other than that on the ARPA side, because this year we did have new growth of 500,000.

262
00:34:57,004 --> 00:35:02,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I expect that to hopefully double next year, but you're right.

263
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,208
[SPEAKER_05]: We wanna keep these positions.

264
00:35:04,328 --> 00:35:17,576
[SPEAKER_05]: We're forecasting, we're looking at the numbers, we are trying to collectively take a look at potentially funding a brand new high school with a $200 million debt exclusion ask of our residents

265
00:35:18,263 --> 00:35:25,529
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a call for street improvement, and there's a call for, obviously, more general fund revenue.

266
00:35:25,549 --> 00:35:27,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew we were in this position.

267
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:39,842
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why when the council proposed an override in August, I agreed that I would approve, I would campaign for, and I would support a $3 million override, which is what you're seeing now.

268
00:35:39,862 --> 00:35:44,946
[SPEAKER_05]: It is going to be needed into the future, potentially, maybe a little less, obviously, hopefully with new growth.

269
00:35:45,858 --> 00:36:06,277
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we're all on the same boat and understanding that there is additional monies that are going to need to be raised one way or another to support 33 people and about five to 10 to 10 people on the city side, but we do have plans for that we are forecasting I do see potentially an override in, in the future, whether that's November or March.

270
00:36:08,134 --> 00:36:35,273
[SPEAKER_05]: the ARPA funding does not run out until December 31st, 2024, so it's a little bit different, but we all, including on the city side, wanna do the best we can with contracts, but with that comes the need for more money, and we have been planning accordingly, and I think it can seem dire, but considering that we're doing the forecasting, you have a school committee, a city council, and a mayor that are ready, willing, and able

271
00:36:37,301 --> 00:36:40,103
[SPEAKER_05]: find the funding one way or another or ask our residents for it.

272
00:36:40,223 --> 00:36:42,264
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just something we cannot depend on.

273
00:36:42,664 --> 00:36:45,365
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I think a lot of survey work needs to be done in the fall.

274
00:36:45,505 --> 00:36:48,987
[SPEAKER_05]: What will our residents support so that we can move that forward on a ballot?

275
00:36:49,428 --> 00:37:05,096
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're doing the hard work and the schools are using the ESSER funding because it runs out and the city side has some for fiscal year 25, but for the second part of fiscal year 25 and fiscal year 26, we will need additional funding if we want to maintain increasing

276
00:37:05,835 --> 00:37:07,356
[SPEAKER_05]: City services and school services.

277
00:37:08,176 --> 00:37:12,218
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just a little tidbit but I member Hays I know you wanted to comment.

278
00:37:13,478 --> 00:37:17,740
[SPEAKER_16]: Just one question, how many adjustment counselors are currently funded by Esther.

279
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:22,261
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll get that in a minute.

280
00:37:22,522 --> 00:37:23,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

281
00:37:26,636 --> 00:37:39,068
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, I was surprised to hear you use a number to describe the high school considering construction costs have gone up that again I'm sorry, I was surprised to hear you use the number 200 million for high school I don't think that there's a high school that could be built anywhere for 200 million anymore.

282
00:37:42,571 --> 00:37:47,975
[SPEAKER_05]: If we get the MSBA loan, we'll find out in the fall, we would have to ask for $200 million debt exclusion.

283
00:37:48,155 --> 00:37:48,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, thank you.

284
00:37:50,757 --> 00:37:53,559
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought you said a $200 million high school, and I was like, ooh, that would be something.

285
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:55,481
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to $350 million, but I'm going to go with $400 million, just to be safe.

286
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:55,761
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

287
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:56,581
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

288
00:37:57,162 --> 00:38:00,524
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate your comments on the funding.

289
00:38:00,564 --> 00:38:11,592
[SPEAKER_13]: I do also want to point out that aside from the 33 and a half people, we have most of our paraprofessionals and revolving accounts, which is totally, perhaps not even allowed.

290
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:17,919
[SPEAKER_13]: When I talked to the, the president of the Massachusetts school school.

291
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:28,846
[SPEAKER_13]: No, the, the, the accounting, the school business operations at Maslow, I forget what their dental stands for.

292
00:38:33,115 --> 00:38:38,137
[SPEAKER_13]: operating budget employees out of revolving accounts was palpable.

293
00:38:39,258 --> 00:38:46,221
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm a chair of the Shore Educational Collaborative as the Medford representative.

294
00:38:46,842 --> 00:38:54,305
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's a wonderful meeting because every month I get to sit down with school committee members who I have a relationship with at this point.

295
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:59,748
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can ask them very pointed questions about things that we do and say, hey, do you do that?

296
00:39:00,408 --> 00:39:07,555
[SPEAKER_13]: And universally, nobody does what we do here, we have so many employees that are not on our operating budget.

297
00:39:07,936 --> 00:39:18,065
[SPEAKER_13]: And so when we look at, you know, the number on the DC website, well that that none of those employees are included in how much we spend on our schools.

298
00:39:18,246 --> 00:39:23,331
[SPEAKER_13]: So in reality we spend more on our schools than we are reporting that we do, which I suppose is

299
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:31,297
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess that's a good thing, but it is a totally not transparent way of paying for people to work for us.

300
00:39:31,938 --> 00:39:45,250
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is also a highly risky thing when the pandemic hit and we shut down after school, we were all like, how are we gonna keep paying these people that are actually not in our operating budget because the money stopped flowing.

301
00:39:46,531 --> 00:39:51,075
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that it's good to hear that the city is planning

302
00:39:52,113 --> 00:40:06,199
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know exactly the timelines of when an override would allow us to spend that money, but if it was in March, I would hope we would already have our budget halfway done or more by March, and whether or not we're cutting people or.

303
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:27,819
[SPEAKER_13]: The residents have been giving the democratic option to decide to fund their schools should have already happened before March, because it's, it's, I mean the superintendent can't be, you know, as happened in 2020, you know, was given a weekend to cut $400,000 school committee had no input, because we couldn't have a meeting.

304
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:35,303
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just think it's not fair to the superintendent to ask her to plan for something.

305
00:40:36,738 --> 00:40:38,620
[SPEAKER_13]: and then not tell her what that thing is.

306
00:40:39,901 --> 00:40:45,107
[SPEAKER_13]: So sooner is better, and maybe just some more transparency about.

307
00:40:46,107 --> 00:40:57,273
[SPEAKER_13]: What are like if you're if the mayor is saying that we in fact are going to be able to find all these positions for July one, I would throw a party, I'd be very happy.

308
00:40:57,953 --> 00:41:04,076
[SPEAKER_13]: And I frankly wouldn't even ask how, because if the mayor has enough free cash, and she says she's going to do it.

309
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:09,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, then, how are you, because we do not fund the public schools the school committee does not.

310
00:41:10,339 --> 00:41:13,321
[SPEAKER_13]: So, just like with the number that we've been given.

311
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:15,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever it is, is what we get.

312
00:41:15,926 --> 00:41:27,896
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just, I guess I don't have a lot of confidence that next March and April, we are not just sitting around figuring out what departments to slash.

313
00:41:28,577 --> 00:41:33,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Because some of those people, there's now 33 and a half people, we will all agree cannot be cut.

314
00:41:34,142 --> 00:41:36,944
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we can't cut some of them, we cut other people.

315
00:41:37,365 --> 00:41:38,806
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know where else to cut.

316
00:41:39,607 --> 00:41:39,887
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

317
00:41:44,142 --> 00:41:45,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin.

318
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:56,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the podium blocks me, frankly, the way the position that it's in I'm not sure if you can see I know I often can't see the superintendent with the podium, but thank you.

319
00:41:56,917 --> 00:41:58,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been waiting a little bit, a little while.

320
00:41:59,704 --> 00:42:17,496
[SPEAKER_04]: which is why I think maybe you can't see me but I wanted to ask as well so there's a few things when I first came on to the school committee, the budget process was very different than it is now and I know that we had a director of finance in the interim, that sort of change things and some of the recommendations

321
00:42:18,717 --> 00:42:20,258
[SPEAKER_04]: on recommendations from this committee.

322
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:37,445
[SPEAKER_04]: In the past, just so for folks who are listening or in the audience or watching online, in the past, what would happen is department heads would come before the committee, would sort of describe what happened in their, what happens in their department, would break down what their department did and what they were proposing was needed in the future.

323
00:42:37,585 --> 00:42:40,506
[SPEAKER_04]: And that process was sort of eliminated in this last iteration.

324
00:42:40,526 --> 00:42:44,928
[SPEAKER_04]: And it became more of a sort of global look at it at a larger number.

325
00:42:44,948 --> 00:42:46,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I frankly liked

326
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:55,575
[SPEAKER_04]: the transparency that occurred when department heads were able to come up and we were able to ask them about what was needed and how we were able to get to certain numbers.

327
00:42:55,735 --> 00:43:00,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the process was longer as a result of that, but personally, I preferred that.

328
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:06,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt like it was more, for me, it helped me better understand the budget and where money was coming and going.

329
00:43:06,722 --> 00:43:11,284
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were also able to really understand what each school had.

330
00:43:11,365 --> 00:43:15,767
[SPEAKER_04]: So how many adjustment counselors were at X school, how many,

331
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:26,603
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, BCBAs, we're at Wise School, we were able to sort of see equity across the district or inequity across the district and how it might be able to be addressed.

332
00:43:26,723 --> 00:43:29,546
[SPEAKER_04]: And in this iteration, I'm not finding that as much.

333
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:37,536
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to mention that to my colleagues here and to the audience as well, because I think that we always have the opportunity to change the process.

334
00:43:38,004 --> 00:43:46,789
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the more transparent and simplified the process can be, as much as one can do with a, you know, $70-$80 million budget, the better it is.

335
00:43:46,849 --> 00:44:00,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I have worked on multi-million dollar budgets in my professional life, and it has been a much different process and one much more similar to what we had seen earlier with sort of department by department, subtotal by subtotal.

336
00:44:00,775 --> 00:44:02,337
[SPEAKER_04]: which for me was particularly helpful.

337
00:44:02,738 --> 00:44:11,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Another real concern I have about this budget is we're talking SEL, we're talking post-pandemic relief, we're talking ARPA and ESSER.

338
00:44:12,495 --> 00:44:33,576
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I haven't really heard a lot of discussion about our underrepresented subgroups and the increased need of our underrepresented subgroups, particularly we know we have a mental health crisis happening right now, how we're just how we're, you know, thinking about that for our student population, how we're thinking about we just recently to my

339
00:44:34,596 --> 00:44:54,334
[SPEAKER_04]: relief passed a resolution, ensuring non discrimination and inclusion and non exclusion from all activities that are school based before school, during school and after school, and yet I continue to hear from families, and I am concerned about particularly summer programming.

340
00:44:54,989 --> 00:45:06,335
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we're doing around summer programming, for example, the summer fun camp, which has historically been, you know, one or two general education teachers and a lot of high school students.

341
00:45:06,555 --> 00:45:16,441
[SPEAKER_04]: More recently, through a lot of work from community members, we were able to get increased services provided there for some students with higher needs, students with disabilities, other students.

342
00:45:17,221 --> 00:45:18,743
[SPEAKER_04]: so that they could access that program.

343
00:45:19,243 --> 00:45:39,561
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't seem clear to me as to whether that's happening this summer, or whether that's happening with any of our summer programming or enrichment programming or after school programming, or any of our programming and I don't know, a lot of times when we asked that question we're told this step that people aren't available, that it's hard difficult to hire folks but if we don't even have them.

344
00:45:40,672 --> 00:46:03,069
[SPEAKER_04]: allocated in a budget, or if we're not talking about how they are allocated in the budget, if they are, whether it's through additional special education funding for grants that, again, we don't see on this particular budget sheet, which can be substantive in their money, the IDEA funds, other funds, not knowing where that money is going is really tricky for me, and understanding how that gets teased out is really tricky for me.

345
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:06,672
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, I think we talked in the last meeting or the meeting prior,

346
00:46:07,472 --> 00:46:11,296
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically about the revolving accounts and what kind of income they generate.

347
00:46:11,356 --> 00:46:31,434
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, if the, and this is just an example, I don't have these numbers for real, but if, for example, the summer fund program, which is a summer camp for students in the Medford community that is housed in one of our schools, if for example that, and it's tuition driven,

348
00:46:32,526 --> 00:46:48,970
[SPEAKER_04]: If, for example, that program made a profit of say, I don't know $40,000 I don't know that it does but say for example it made a profit of $40,000 yet was unable to accommodate individuals who had additional needs for any number of reasons because budget money wasn't allocated because what have you.

349
00:46:49,390 --> 00:47:09,268
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not meeting the requirement of reasonable accommodations, for example, and how are we really considering that, particularly when we're talking about SEL for those who folks who don't understand the acronym I would just share it social emotional learning and the importance of belonging, being part of one's community and feeling that and also recruitment of skills so that you start in September.

350
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:18,154
[SPEAKER_04]: with the same skills that you had and regression, preventing regression of skills so that you don't go backwards over the summer, particularly for our more marginalized subgroups.

351
00:47:18,194 --> 00:47:20,656
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just feel like that conversation is being lost here.

352
00:47:20,676 --> 00:47:23,138
[SPEAKER_04]: So in summary, I have two comments overall.

353
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:25,860
[SPEAKER_04]: One is I think we're losing a bit of the conversation.

354
00:47:27,161 --> 00:47:30,203
[SPEAKER_04]: 33 staff that we have to consider is very dire.

355
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:34,926
[SPEAKER_04]: And also these other pieces that I feel like aren't being discussed are very dire.

356
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:36,227
[SPEAKER_04]: And then secondly,

357
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,784
[SPEAKER_04]: the process and the transparency around the process.

358
00:47:40,884 --> 00:47:46,686
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been far more vague for me than in previous processes.

359
00:47:46,726 --> 00:47:54,887
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is not a reflection of the superintendent by any means, you know, we had, you know, different directors of finance over the past term and things have changed.

360
00:47:54,947 --> 00:47:58,788
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and hopefully we'll be hiring another director of finance soon.

361
00:47:58,928 --> 00:48:06,990
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we really need to hear from the community as well about what the process can look like and how it can be more transparent and whether in fact people are understanding

362
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:16,111
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the language that we're even talking about or whether they're looking at these sheets and know how it translates into schools or anything, because I'm not entirely convinced that they do.

363
00:48:16,332 --> 00:48:17,672
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for hearing me out.

364
00:48:17,692 --> 00:48:20,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

365
00:48:20,494 --> 00:48:21,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor, just one quick.

366
00:48:21,795 --> 00:48:22,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

367
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:23,096
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

368
00:48:23,376 --> 00:48:34,543
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm assuming we're going to go to the audience in a moment, but I just wanted to ask that folks clearly state their name so I can put them into the minutes that I'm taking.

369
00:48:35,063 --> 00:48:36,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record.

370
00:48:37,864 --> 00:48:40,966
[SPEAKER_05]: two minutes or so, because I know we have enough, we have two more meetings.

371
00:48:41,907 --> 00:48:43,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Would anybody like to speak or?

372
00:48:45,209 --> 00:48:45,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor?

373
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:46,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

374
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:54,475
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we have to do the, I don't know if it's the against and the for's or the for's and the against, like I- For public hearing?

375
00:48:54,896 --> 00:48:55,176
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

376
00:48:55,436 --> 00:48:56,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we do that after public hearing?

377
00:48:57,461 --> 00:48:59,482
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, I'm talking about the audience.

378
00:48:59,722 --> 00:49:04,545
[SPEAKER_05]: General comments can be stated after we do the for and against.

379
00:49:04,865 --> 00:49:07,547
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can just let the process follow through.

380
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:12,070
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not for or against it, just let me run through that, and then we'll take full comments.

381
00:49:19,714 --> 00:49:25,278
[SPEAKER_05]: The superintendent's budget proposal with 71 million as a number, plus using the 512

382
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:28,493
[SPEAKER_05]: 15,000 additional for ESSER.

383
00:49:33,564 --> 00:49:34,647
[SPEAKER_04]: But point of information.

384
00:49:35,177 --> 00:49:42,062
[SPEAKER_04]: information you asked is through the chair is member Ruseau asking that we do that before we hear from the public because I would, I prefer to do it.

385
00:49:42,642 --> 00:49:56,852
[SPEAKER_13]: We always do is that we say is, is there a reason that we always mean I mean I just watched a city council meeting where the people who want to speak in the affirmative for something, come up they said they get to speak, and then the people who want to speak against it.

386
00:49:57,552 --> 00:49:59,173
[SPEAKER_13]: After that, that part is closed.

387
00:49:59,573 --> 00:50:11,156
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the people that want to speak against it come up and speak and I'm looking at the law right now that does say that we're getting those for and against it doesn't say that they have to be everybody for goes together.

388
00:50:11,176 --> 00:50:13,036
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think it's cleaner.

389
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:14,837
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't care.

390
00:50:15,517 --> 00:50:20,338
[SPEAKER_13]: People say whether they're for or against the $71 million recommendation so I can keep that in the notes.

391
00:50:21,279 --> 00:50:22,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, point of information there.

392
00:50:22,981 --> 00:50:24,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Member McLaughlin.

393
00:50:24,102 --> 00:50:32,468
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was confused and I just want to make sure that others aren't confused because, you know, sitting behind here and having more access than maybe other people and I'm still confused.

394
00:50:32,508 --> 00:50:43,575
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I was misunderstanding was I thought Member Ruseau was asking that we are voting for or against as a committee, this number, and that is not what I'm understanding.

395
00:50:43,635 --> 00:50:51,061
[SPEAKER_04]: He's asking for public to come up to discuss for, and then the folks against or vice versa, against or for.

396
00:50:52,256 --> 00:50:55,058
[SPEAKER_04]: and then close each session before we make a vote.

397
00:50:55,098 --> 00:50:55,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that accurate?

398
00:50:55,778 --> 00:50:56,218
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.

399
00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:01,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody who would like to speak can speak under the for section, the against section, or after.

400
00:51:01,382 --> 00:51:03,203
[SPEAKER_05]: It would just be opened up to any comments.

401
00:51:03,883 --> 00:51:12,969
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll ask anybody that is for this budget proposal, please step forward, name and address for the record.

402
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:16,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody that is for.

403
00:51:16,971 --> 00:51:21,554
[SPEAKER_05]: So consider that portion of the public hearing closed

404
00:51:22,321 --> 00:51:29,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'll ask anybody who would like to speak against that budget proposal please step forward, name and address for the record.

405
00:51:38,824 --> 00:51:39,565
[SPEAKER_05]: The little face.

406
00:51:39,585 --> 00:51:40,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there you go.

407
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:41,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's all right.

408
00:51:42,505 --> 00:51:45,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm able to get your voice.

409
00:51:49,989 --> 00:51:54,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Audrey fate or 49 with their street against Madam Mayor.

410
00:51:55,134 --> 00:52:00,779
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm speaking here today because I'm very concerned about the budget deficit for Medford High School next year.

411
00:52:01,795 --> 00:52:07,176
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a 24 year veteran teacher and I'm deeply vested in the success of MHS.

412
00:52:08,056 --> 00:52:14,438
[SPEAKER_14]: As everyone knows, the city hired Mr. Mike Welch, a seasoned former superintendent to assess the culture and climate of MHS.

413
00:52:15,178 --> 00:52:26,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Welch presented his findings on May 1st and it is my understanding that the school committee is in agreement with his recommendations and have requested from you an additional $900,000 to fund the badly needed improvements.

414
00:52:27,682 --> 00:52:48,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of these include establish a clear district safety security leadership team, provide additional support for assistant principals in each house, establish a building wide associate principal role for MHS, provide individual and collective mentoring for assistant principals and deans, recruit, train, and hire at least four building based permanent substitute teachers.

415
00:52:49,321 --> 00:52:56,328
[SPEAKER_14]: It is also my understanding that not only are you not putting this money into the budget, but you are in fact cutting the public school budget.

416
00:52:56,969 --> 00:52:59,111
[SPEAKER_14]: I am extremely perplexed by this decision.

417
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:05,317
[SPEAKER_14]: First off, why would you spend $24,000 to hire Mr. Welch and then not implement his recommendations?

418
00:53:06,518 --> 00:53:11,483
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's a misconception as to exactly how and why the building is functioning at all right now.

419
00:53:12,631 --> 00:53:20,956
[SPEAKER_14]: Our current administrators, especially Paul DeLeva and David Blauch, have been performing multiple duties above and beyond the scope of their regular job descriptions.

420
00:53:21,376 --> 00:53:25,418
[SPEAKER_14]: They've been doing this because we are understaffed and have been for quite some time.

421
00:53:26,138 --> 00:53:30,221
[SPEAKER_14]: In addition, the teachers have been holding the line amidst multiple and daily incidents.

422
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:31,621
[SPEAKER_14]: We are not okay.

423
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:38,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Many of the recommendations will support the emotional wellbeing of the teachers, which is severely lacking this year.

424
00:53:38,963 --> 00:53:47,388
[SPEAKER_14]: As a result, we are facing a mass exodus of faculty, administrators, and staff, some of whom have taught at MHS for over 15 years.

425
00:53:48,489 --> 00:53:50,930
[SPEAKER_14]: We cannot survive another year like this.

426
00:53:52,651 --> 00:54:01,676
[SPEAKER_14]: How can we expect a new principal and two new assistant principals next year to be successful when they won't have the proper staffing or funding to support the faculty and staff?

427
00:54:02,634 --> 00:54:03,355
[SPEAKER_14]: and the students.

428
00:54:03,836 --> 00:54:17,612
[SPEAKER_14]: In essence, without implementing Mr. Welsh's other recommendation of leverage existing administrative vacancies to support the next MHS leadership team, we are setting the new administration up for failure, and thus the teachers and students.

429
00:54:19,076 --> 00:54:23,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford High School will also be preparing next year to go through the NEASC accreditation process.

430
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:29,307
[SPEAKER_14]: The outcome of this very detailed and involved analysis will hinge on the decisions that are made now.

431
00:54:30,168 --> 00:54:33,772
[SPEAKER_14]: In conclusion, Madam Mayor, the future of Medford students is in your hands.

432
00:54:34,272 --> 00:54:36,435
[SPEAKER_14]: The system is broken and it's up to you now.

433
00:54:36,895 --> 00:54:40,699
[SPEAKER_14]: You cannot continue to balance the budget on the backs of the teachers and the students.

434
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:46,182
[SPEAKER_14]: We are at a breaking point and you have to ask yourself, what side of this do you wanna be on in the future?

435
00:54:46,722 --> 00:54:52,845
[SPEAKER_14]: Will you only listen when more students and faculty are hurt or will you do what's right and take action now?

436
00:54:54,326 --> 00:54:55,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your time.

437
00:54:55,046 --> 00:55:06,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

438
00:55:10,524 --> 00:55:13,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Evening, Rich Cormier 26 Barbara lane Medford.

439
00:55:14,225 --> 00:55:21,588
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about the 14th draft that I did of this because I'm kind of a snacky guy and I get sarcastic when I feel passionate about something.

440
00:55:22,868 --> 00:55:32,571
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight stand before you as a lifetime resident a method vocational school graduate a parent of three never high school graduates and currently a teacher in the electrical program at the book.

441
00:55:33,513 --> 00:55:42,563
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm passionate about the city and my school and it breaks my heart to watch extremely talented professional teachers leave because of the current climate at our school.

442
00:55:43,624 --> 00:55:51,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you and like Audrey, I have read Mr. Welch's report and he's captured the essence of the school and he delivered a very accurate document.

443
00:55:52,233 --> 00:55:53,995
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is right in the report.

444
00:55:54,847 --> 00:56:00,074
[SPEAKER_00]: A simple line that quotes various teachers as stating that we do not feel like our voices are being heard.

445
00:56:00,995 --> 00:56:07,023
[SPEAKER_00]: The proof of this lies in the fact that you paid a person good money to tell you what we've been screaming for years.

446
00:56:08,345 --> 00:56:09,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Some examples.

447
00:56:10,247 --> 00:56:13,788
[SPEAKER_00]: There were too many students roaming the halls and in the bathrooms.

448
00:56:14,349 --> 00:56:25,433
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a near tragic event to unfurl to get you folks to open the purse strings and fund better security, which has led to a slightly better, but far from perfect situation.

449
00:56:26,734 --> 00:56:34,337
[SPEAKER_00]: We all agree that the three, we knew a long time ago, that the three house system brought about due to the budget cuts would not be a great idea.

450
00:56:34,797 --> 00:56:35,918
[SPEAKER_00]: The school is just too big.

451
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,659
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mr. Welch, he confirmed that.

452
00:56:40,259 --> 00:56:41,879
[SPEAKER_00]: The schedule is unmanageable.

453
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:48,901
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's gonna cost money to fix, but it's gonna be fixed, especially because of the ever-growing CTE side of the building.

454
00:56:49,542 --> 00:56:52,843
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on a committee last year that created a new plan.

455
00:56:52,863 --> 00:56:54,043
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like everybody liked it.

456
00:56:55,043 --> 00:57:00,105
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sitting on somebody's desk right now, and as Mr. Welch stated in his report, it needs to be implemented.

457
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:08,947
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, it didn't take a paid consultant to understand that more turnover that has occurred in the central school administration

458
00:57:09,377 --> 00:57:12,219
[SPEAKER_00]: the more confusing life is at the school and would be.

459
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:16,162
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now a stepping stone, I'm sorry.

460
00:57:16,662 --> 00:57:18,683
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now a stepping stool school.

461
00:57:19,284 --> 00:57:24,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks routinely come here to build a resume and move on to higher paying, more stable positions elsewhere.

462
00:57:25,268 --> 00:57:32,253
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year, we will potentially be welcoming a new assistant superintendent, a principal, two new assistant principals.

463
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:35,715
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the middle of the school year, there'll be three new school committee members.

464
00:57:35,815 --> 00:57:37,076
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume three of you are leaving.

465
00:57:38,973 --> 00:57:48,135
[SPEAKER_00]: A few weeks ago at school committee, we learned that the city received about $3 million from the state that was primarily issued to be used for the schools at the purview of the mayor.

466
00:57:48,595 --> 00:57:51,376
[SPEAKER_00]: And according to Mr. Russo, we will not be seeing that money.

467
00:57:51,996 --> 00:58:00,498
[SPEAKER_00]: Ironically, after being told last year that we had to tighten our belts because the sky would be falling in the next fiscal year, that would be this year.

468
00:58:00,658 --> 00:58:08,380
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now learned that there's a $3 million surplus in this year's budget, which may end up in the rainy day fund according to the city council last week.

469
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:19,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's monsoon season here at Medford High School and I'm no expert, but I would assume that somewhere in that $3 million is enough cash to step up security and hire a new assistant principal.

470
00:58:20,902 --> 00:58:26,583
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do nothing with the report that you paid for, we would ask, well, why did you commission in the first place?

471
00:58:27,503 --> 00:58:33,644
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna need to hire a new consultant in two years who will tell us that we should have done what this consultant told us to do two years ago.

472
00:58:34,104 --> 00:58:38,665
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ask you to please consider that recommendation and put that into your budget.

473
00:58:38,805 --> 00:58:39,145
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

474
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:53,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Hendrick Gideons, 14, Rita Drive.

475
00:58:55,238 --> 00:58:56,719
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm against the budget.

476
00:58:56,739 --> 00:59:06,185
[SPEAKER_11]: I have two kids in the schools, an eight-year-old at Missittuck and a 12-year-old at the Andrews School.

477
00:59:08,598 --> 00:59:09,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Kids are not okay.

478
00:59:10,699 --> 00:59:22,105
[SPEAKER_11]: The fact that the pandemic money is going away, I feel like we're just starting to see the tip of the iceberg about how much damage has happened with our kids.

479
00:59:23,766 --> 00:59:33,130
[SPEAKER_11]: The amount of money that is being put into this problem is seriously lacking.

480
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:34,271
[SPEAKER_11]: We need

481
00:59:35,626 --> 00:59:40,587
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't need to say we will support getting more money if blah blah blah happens.

482
00:59:41,287 --> 00:59:43,368
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to say we need more money.

483
00:59:43,388 --> 00:59:50,049
[SPEAKER_11]: This is how the campaign starts to convince the residents of Medford that we need to pay for this.

484
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:54,631
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, very, very simply, if kids aren't okay.

485
00:59:57,225 --> 01:00:12,810
[SPEAKER_11]: in bad shape as far as their mental health goes, they get on drugs, they start committing crimes, they commit suicide, like there's a zillion different things that can happen to our children if we don't take care of them.

486
01:00:15,063 --> 01:00:26,552
[SPEAKER_11]: Today, I was a volunteer at the Missituck because the Missituck doesn't have the equipment to be able to do an assembly.

487
01:00:26,772 --> 01:00:28,313
[SPEAKER_11]: They have no microphones that work.

488
01:00:30,175 --> 01:00:34,839
[SPEAKER_11]: So I brought in some equipment and I see the kids sitting there.

489
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:43,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of them are doing okay in the assembly, but the adults are constantly having to discipline kids

490
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:48,664
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is markedly different than it was a few years ago.

491
01:00:49,865 --> 01:00:56,711
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm also noticing that the kids that are getting more discipline are black and brown kids.

492
01:00:57,732 --> 01:01:01,795
[SPEAKER_11]: This is really not, I mean, it's not cool at all.

493
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:12,724
[SPEAKER_11]: And what it says to me is that we're either looking towards the wrong children to be working harder on, or they're not getting the services that they need.

494
01:01:16,505 --> 01:01:25,671
[SPEAKER_11]: like staying in the boiling water that we're sitting in now and not jumping out and reevaluating what we're doing.

495
01:01:26,732 --> 01:01:32,216
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems like the time for doing that has really, it's getting more and more serious.

496
01:01:34,037 --> 01:01:35,698
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to see creativity.

497
01:01:37,399 --> 01:01:40,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, there's no contractors available to do any work.

498
01:01:41,382 --> 01:01:43,704
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've got a vocational school

499
01:01:45,563 --> 01:01:48,164
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not going 24 hours a day.

500
01:01:49,145 --> 01:01:54,347
[SPEAKER_11]: We could be teaching additional adult learners at night and making money doing that.

501
01:01:54,927 --> 01:02:00,850
[SPEAKER_11]: There's other ways of making money with the resources that we have that we're not considering.

502
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:11,114
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to raise more money, but we also need to think about what we're doing and reevaluate stuff because we're just not meeting the needs of the kids.

503
01:02:12,575 --> 01:02:12,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

504
01:02:23,481 --> 01:02:26,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Charlene Douglas, 414 High Street, Medford.

505
01:02:27,303 --> 01:02:30,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Lifetime resident also, very long time resident since third grade.

506
01:02:31,606 --> 01:02:38,390
[SPEAKER_06]: So been here and so obviously I'm not in favor of the budget for a number of reasons.

507
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:51,777
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of them that was, and Mr. Russo, you can correct me, you may correct me if I state this incorrectly, but Mr. Welsh's reports, I think they said they were going to make the recommendations based on

508
01:02:52,421 --> 01:02:58,744
[SPEAKER_06]: the existing personnel or people that are in the budget that we have already, is that correct?

509
01:02:59,245 --> 01:03:08,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Like for example, there is a salary for three substitute teachers at the high school.

510
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:21,456
[SPEAKER_06]: So there used to be nine, then we went to seven, then we went to five, and now we're at three that we don't have.

511
01:03:22,236 --> 01:03:25,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe the pay at one point was 16,000.

512
01:03:25,198 --> 01:03:29,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it went up to 18 and it may be $21,000.

513
01:03:29,761 --> 01:03:31,522
[SPEAKER_06]: It may.

514
01:03:32,103 --> 01:03:33,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I could be wrong.

515
01:03:33,264 --> 01:03:33,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still thinking 18,000.

516
01:03:34,124 --> 01:03:40,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know who we're going to get to be a substitute teacher for that money.

517
01:03:40,489 --> 01:03:43,851
[SPEAKER_06]: If that's what's in the budget, then that's just window dressing.

518
01:03:44,471 --> 01:03:45,212
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all that is.

519
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:49,415
[SPEAKER_06]: That is not going to get the problems that the high school solved.

520
01:03:50,592 --> 01:03:56,871
[SPEAKER_06]: We have three assistant principals presently, I believe, okay?

521
01:03:57,386 --> 01:03:59,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the recommendation was for an additional.

522
01:04:00,087 --> 01:04:03,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's not reallocate and give people additional work.

523
01:04:03,669 --> 01:04:10,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's look at what really is needed based on Mr. Welch's, you spent good money, right?

524
01:04:11,233 --> 01:04:13,974
[SPEAKER_06]: All of you, you said that that's what this was all about.

525
01:04:14,494 --> 01:04:21,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor, you told us, you promised us that you would make sure that that high school is safe and a place where students want to go.

526
01:04:23,219 --> 01:04:25,060
[SPEAKER_06]: My niece and nephew will be coming.

527
01:04:25,882 --> 01:04:26,502
[SPEAKER_06]: to the high school.

528
01:04:27,122 --> 01:04:29,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to make sure that they are safe.

529
01:04:30,603 --> 01:04:36,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to make sure that I don't have to worry about them being bullied or anything at that high school.

530
01:04:37,965 --> 01:04:48,548
[SPEAKER_06]: And can you promise me that you're going to look at that and make sure that what is recommended is really in there and not just, I can't, what was the term?

531
01:04:48,728 --> 01:04:50,008
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sorry, I should have wrote it down.

532
01:04:50,657 --> 01:04:52,018
[SPEAKER_06]: but I didn't bring a pen or pencil.

533
01:04:52,078 --> 01:04:54,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't even gonna speak tonight to be perfectly honest with you.

534
01:04:55,201 --> 01:05:00,725
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just couldn't sit there and listen to the fact that, well, we have three substitute teaching positions.

535
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:02,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, why aren't they filled?

536
01:05:04,048 --> 01:05:05,950
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're so good, why?

537
01:05:09,232 --> 01:05:11,194
[SPEAKER_07]: You wanna work for $18,000 a year?

538
01:05:11,214 --> 01:05:13,676
[SPEAKER_06]: $21,000 a year?

539
01:05:15,758 --> 01:05:18,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm paying a contractor at my father's house, correct?

540
01:05:19,155 --> 01:05:20,496
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think I'm paying him an hour?

541
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:23,680
[SPEAKER_06]: You think I'm paying him that kind of money?

542
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:26,162
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got a guy raking leaves.

543
01:05:26,703 --> 01:05:28,044
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think I'm paying him an hour?

544
01:05:29,186 --> 01:05:32,609
[SPEAKER_06]: He's raking leaves $20 an hour minimum.

545
01:05:34,712 --> 01:05:35,773
[SPEAKER_06]: They come out, they look at me.

546
01:05:36,533 --> 01:05:37,755
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a little bit of leaves there.

547
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:41,374
[SPEAKER_06]: That's $200, that's what they say.

548
01:05:42,095 --> 01:05:43,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Every place I go, nothing less.

549
01:05:44,299 --> 01:05:45,140
[SPEAKER_06]: So please stop.

550
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:50,027
[SPEAKER_06]: And please allocate, use the free cash, do what's right.

551
01:05:50,648 --> 01:05:52,431
[SPEAKER_06]: We just passed huge money.

552
01:05:53,312 --> 01:05:54,214
[SPEAKER_06]: We worked hard.

553
01:05:55,896 --> 01:05:57,937
[SPEAKER_06]: the millionaire taxes, all of those things.

554
01:05:58,197 --> 01:05:59,698
[SPEAKER_06]: The MTA worked hard.

555
01:06:00,279 --> 01:06:07,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Use that money for what it's supposed to be there for and stop pretending it's not there and looking for other ways to use that.

556
01:06:08,084 --> 01:06:11,245
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not just happening in this city, it's happening in other cities.

557
01:06:12,866 --> 01:06:13,907
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we fought for.

558
01:06:14,407 --> 01:06:20,611
[SPEAKER_06]: We fought for the best education and all for our students.

559
01:06:21,152 --> 01:06:23,033
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what these teachers are about here tonight.

560
01:06:23,673 --> 01:06:24,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

561
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:35,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for all that spoke.

562
01:06:36,394 --> 01:06:41,141
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, well, we've got to close the, there's no more.

563
01:06:42,483 --> 01:06:43,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Close the hearing and then we can communicate.

564
01:06:46,343 --> 01:06:49,204
[SPEAKER_09]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

565
01:06:50,344 --> 01:06:57,727
[SPEAKER_09]: So the budget as printed, it was $900,000 short approximately of the immediate needs identified by school committee.

566
01:06:58,507 --> 01:07:04,769
[SPEAKER_09]: There was some concern about, you know, if that's gonna lead to layoffs, turns out that it's not this year.

567
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:11,975
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's only by using up almost all of the ESSER funding, which, as I know, goes away anyhow.

568
01:07:12,875 --> 01:07:14,437
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, that money is going to be gone.

569
01:07:14,977 --> 01:07:24,124
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it's going to be even tougher next time around, because you got 33 and a half positions, depending on that ESSER money, which is going away.

570
01:07:28,217 --> 01:07:33,400
[SPEAKER_09]: school committee really needs to just consider the fact that more revenue is needed in the city.

571
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:44,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Overall, they should be aware of the need for city council to once again be given access to legal help for zoning to spur development, raise money that way.

572
01:07:45,817 --> 01:08:01,235
[SPEAKER_09]: And they should also be aware that besides that school budget itself in their role of looking after the welfare of school children, they should really be looking for ways to demand that the streets get repaired, because the only time that.

573
01:08:03,498 --> 01:08:08,625
[SPEAKER_09]: streets are approved for vulnerable road users is when they are repaved and so on.

574
01:08:08,665 --> 01:08:10,227
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's not happening quickly enough.

575
01:08:10,848 --> 01:08:20,101
[SPEAKER_09]: And frankly, school children are the most vulnerable road users of all, especially when we don't have good bus access to the high school.

576
01:08:23,012 --> 01:08:43,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, it comes down to the fact that we expect these problems to be fixed in future years, we need to be increasing revenues, and I'm glad to hear that the mayor and others are interested in doing a prop two and a half override, but I would challenge that if you wait until the presidential primary election at Super Tuesday.

577
01:08:44,232 --> 01:08:57,396
[SPEAKER_09]: that is going to be too late to affect next year's budget, because it will already have been done, or half done, as member Rousseau said earlier.

578
01:08:57,896 --> 01:09:08,379
[SPEAKER_09]: So I should hope that you would strongly consider holding that two and a half election in November, not on Super Tuesday, if that's the way forward.

579
01:09:08,999 --> 01:09:12,360
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it is, but if that's the way forward, it really should be in November.

580
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:14,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Not during the presidential primary.

581
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:15,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

582
01:09:16,066 --> 01:09:16,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

583
01:09:27,408 --> 01:09:31,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, thank you for the opportunity to speak to the school committee and the mayor.

584
01:09:32,353 --> 01:09:51,710
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is David McKenna to vine street, and I'm here to ask the mayor to fund all of the immediate needs that were identified the $320,000 that the superintendent has been forced to cut from the budget, so that we won't have librarians, so we'll have you know library aids.

585
01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:57,285
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as one of our teachers said, this is why staff are leaving our district.

586
01:09:57,485 --> 01:09:59,752
[SPEAKER_01]: We're totally not funding the immediate needs.

587
01:10:00,986 --> 01:10:05,348
[SPEAKER_01]: We heard that there's an immediate need for more substitute teachers at the high school.

588
01:10:05,748 --> 01:10:19,692
[SPEAKER_01]: We heard that based on all the recommendations that were in Welsh's report, there is $0 being allocated to that, that this is a revenue neutral proposal as the superintendent described.

589
01:10:20,793 --> 01:10:22,293
[SPEAKER_01]: We have immediate needs.

590
01:10:22,313 --> 01:10:24,374
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also an immediate need at the library.

591
01:10:26,189 --> 01:10:30,770
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just not okay to cut immediate needs year after year.

592
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:44,792
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, based on an unacceptable budget, you know, to try to do an override for what the gap is or what the cliff is when the number this year is not meeting our kids' needs.

593
01:10:45,072 --> 01:10:46,653
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not safe at the high school.

594
01:10:47,253 --> 01:10:52,634
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we can't even do assemblies as we heard it at an elementary school because there's no microphones.

595
01:10:53,034 --> 01:10:54,114
[SPEAKER_01]: This is ridiculous.

596
01:10:55,282 --> 01:11:03,806
[SPEAKER_01]: So please use whatever resources you can this year over the next month with your staff to find the money to fund these immediate needs for our kids.

597
01:11:05,947 --> 01:11:12,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Second thing I'd like to ask is that we make a real plan for our future in Medford.

598
01:11:13,331 --> 01:11:14,332
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that look like?

599
01:11:14,652 --> 01:11:15,892
[SPEAKER_01]: What number do we need?

600
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:22,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I heard you say that you wanna do a survey in the fall to see what would residents of Medford support?

601
01:11:24,485 --> 01:11:32,191
[SPEAKER_01]: but the members in this room have a role to tell us what you need and to get the word out.

602
01:11:32,752 --> 01:11:39,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Last election, I knocked on over a thousand doors for candidates that were elected and I will knock on doors for you.

603
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:42,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us what the number is, be transparent.

604
01:11:43,521 --> 01:11:45,362
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a serious revenue need.

605
01:11:46,883 --> 01:11:52,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Last thing I wanna address about this two and a half override if we go to it is,

606
01:11:54,514 --> 01:11:58,177
[SPEAKER_01]: The Newton voted down an override a few months ago.

607
01:11:58,217 --> 01:12:06,303
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might think, well, this is controversial, but Newton is spending $5,500 per pupil more than we are.

608
01:12:06,443 --> 01:12:12,708
[SPEAKER_01]: They're spending $22,000 a year per pupil just from their city budget, whereas we're at about 16 five.

609
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:14,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so it is apples and oranges.

610
01:12:14,989 --> 01:12:16,811
[SPEAKER_01]: The situation in Newton is totally different.

611
01:12:17,271 --> 01:12:18,992
[SPEAKER_01]: They approved an override for $12 million in 2002.

612
01:12:21,394 --> 01:12:24,076
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've had an extra $12 million for 20 years.

613
01:12:25,037 --> 01:12:28,160
[SPEAKER_01]: They approved another override for another $8 million in 2014.

614
01:12:29,021 --> 01:12:32,384
[SPEAKER_01]: City of Medford has never approved a Prop 2.5 override.

615
01:12:33,725 --> 01:12:36,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Former mayors have never asked us to approve one.

616
01:12:36,167 --> 01:12:40,671
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think there's been a lack of leadership in the past.

617
01:12:40,791 --> 01:12:44,234
[SPEAKER_01]: And mayor, I'm asking you to be that leader.

618
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:46,856
[SPEAKER_01]: All the people in this room will support you.

619
01:12:47,895 --> 01:12:52,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us what the number is, you know, and it's not just the schools that's underfunded.

620
01:12:52,238 --> 01:12:58,441
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a comment made about it's not safe for the kids to walk to school because of the state of the roads, the crosswalks, the sidewalks.

621
01:12:59,102 --> 01:13:03,904
[SPEAKER_01]: We have real needs and it's time for action.

622
01:13:04,745 --> 01:13:06,426
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thank you for your leadership.

623
01:13:16,161 --> 01:13:16,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

624
01:13:16,983 --> 01:13:21,032
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Anthony again live at 45 Elm Hill Avenue in Lemonston, Massachusetts.

625
01:13:22,114 --> 01:13:26,364
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to make a quick point and then ask for a point of clarification from the committee.

626
01:13:28,697 --> 01:13:38,485
[SPEAKER_12]: My quick point is the idea of moving, engaging specialists and turning them into a dean position is really not what the high school needs.

627
01:13:38,685 --> 01:13:51,897
[SPEAKER_12]: When I started, I've only been working at the high school for seven years now, but when I first started, we had five assistant principals, one on the Vogue side and four dealing with the freshmen, sophomore, junior and senior.

628
01:13:51,937 --> 01:13:52,897
[SPEAKER_12]: And when I started working here,

629
01:13:54,977 --> 01:14:02,442
[SPEAKER_12]: pretty thin, they were really really overworked, and now we're down to four assistant principals, and we're losing two of them.

630
01:14:02,842 --> 01:14:08,485
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's just going to be a cycle of people coming in, people realizing it's not sustainable, and then leaving.

631
01:14:08,825 --> 01:14:13,548
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's not going to allow for the staff to have continuity that's not gonna allow for kids to have continuity.

632
01:14:14,389 --> 01:14:19,752
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm saying we need to keep the engagement specialists, especially in a post pandemic world in which absenteeism and

633
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:23,454
[SPEAKER_12]: skipping of classes is such a large problem.

634
01:14:24,095 --> 01:14:26,596
[SPEAKER_12]: And we need to bring back at minimum one more AP.

635
01:14:28,638 --> 01:14:34,982
[SPEAKER_12]: And then my point of clarification, I would like to ask when y'all can speak.

636
01:14:37,564 --> 01:14:41,387
[SPEAKER_12]: We got $3 million additional in Chapter 70 money as I understand it.

637
01:14:41,687 --> 01:14:42,668
[SPEAKER_12]: The difference between

638
01:14:44,302 --> 01:14:46,562
[SPEAKER_12]: The 23 budget and the proposed budget is about 2 million.

639
01:14:47,223 --> 01:14:53,664
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wanted to ask for a point of clarification on the million dollars that I don't know that is accounted for.

640
01:14:53,684 --> 01:14:55,264
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

641
01:14:55,464 --> 01:14:55,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

642
01:14:56,164 --> 01:14:56,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

643
01:15:07,246 --> 01:15:10,967
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's no more comments specifically against online, okay.

644
01:15:13,174 --> 01:15:14,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

645
01:15:14,515 --> 01:15:15,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Sophie Ricks?

646
01:15:19,519 --> 01:15:20,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record.

647
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:30,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Two minutes, please.

648
01:15:30,126 --> 01:15:33,088
[SPEAKER_07]: It won't let me start my video.

649
01:15:33,188 --> 01:15:34,549
[SPEAKER_07]: It says the host has stopped it.

650
01:15:47,076 --> 01:15:48,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you start the video, please?

651
01:15:50,277 --> 01:15:50,937
[SPEAKER_15]: We can hear you.

652
01:15:51,057 --> 01:15:53,158
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you want to just speak.

653
01:15:53,218 --> 01:15:54,458
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, sure.

654
01:15:55,058 --> 01:15:59,879
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you, Audrey, Rich, Charlene, William, Dave, especially for speaking.

655
01:15:59,899 --> 01:16:01,340
[SPEAKER_15]: I am opposed to this budget.

656
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:09,142
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor, I wrote to you a long email four days ago that touched on funding for our library, road repairs, playgrounds.

657
01:16:10,182 --> 01:16:14,023
[SPEAKER_15]: But tonight, I'll just read the part regarding schools since I haven't yet received a response.

658
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:18,145
[SPEAKER_15]: I ask you to create a budget that adequately funds our public schools.

659
01:16:19,266 --> 01:16:28,972
[SPEAKER_15]: While our neighboring communities are prioritizing paying their teachers wages that reflect their hard work, our schools are struggling to retain staff and recreate new ones, as you've heard from people tonight.

660
01:16:29,913 --> 01:16:35,997
[SPEAKER_15]: As you know, our buildings and grounds are in disrepair and our teachers are having to find huge amounts of classroom supplies out of their own pockets.

661
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:43,822
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm especially disturbed to hear about the Mississippi not even being able to have an assembly, as that's where our five-year-old will be starting in September.

662
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:52,738
[SPEAKER_15]: I was really disturbed and depressed to read the full climate report regarding Medford High School and the challenges that go far beyond the aging building.

663
01:16:53,038 --> 01:17:02,187
[SPEAKER_15]: If we can't even adequately fund our current needs, how can we possibly fund the necessities mentioned in the report, like hiring full-time substitutes to take the burden off of classroom teachers?

664
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:05,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Will it feel safe to send our kids to Medford High when the time comes?

665
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:08,833
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm hearing from lots of other people that they do not feel that way right now.

666
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:15,431
[SPEAKER_15]: We have not yet heard a plan from your office about addressing the challenges and solutions proposed in the report.

667
01:17:16,251 --> 01:17:19,112
[SPEAKER_15]: A $3 million override, it feels like peanuts.

668
01:17:20,712 --> 01:17:26,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Last year, I was not supportive of the override that you brought up, even though I am fully supportive of a true override.

669
01:17:26,913 --> 01:17:32,054
[SPEAKER_15]: As Dave was saying, other towns have funded far, far more than this.

670
01:17:32,074 --> 01:17:34,855
[SPEAKER_15]: $3 million won't fund anything.

671
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:35,635
[SPEAKER_15]: It feels like it's,

672
01:17:36,499 --> 01:17:40,323
[SPEAKER_15]: just kind of laughable, and I ask you to fund a real override.

673
01:17:40,343 --> 01:17:43,586
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank you for everyone else who's speaking.

674
01:17:43,687 --> 01:17:48,792
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate public speaking, and I'm only doing this because I feel passionately about how important it is.

675
01:17:49,172 --> 01:17:53,197
[SPEAKER_15]: I have my three-year-old right here with me who would agree with me.

676
01:17:53,477 --> 01:17:57,921
[SPEAKER_15]: So please do what you can to fund our schools adequately.

677
01:17:58,002 --> 01:17:58,322
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

678
01:18:07,518 --> 01:18:09,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Lou, name and address of the record, please.

679
01:18:10,379 --> 01:18:14,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Lou Spagnola, 86 Gore Road, Revere Mass.

680
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:18,101
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a teacher at Medford Vocational.

681
01:18:18,901 --> 01:18:19,702
[SPEAKER_10]: You can hear me, right?

682
01:18:21,122 --> 01:18:21,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Lou.

683
01:18:22,102 --> 01:18:22,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

684
01:18:22,883 --> 01:18:24,923
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, so everybody's made great points.

685
01:18:25,043 --> 01:18:26,924
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to keep piling onto the same thing.

686
01:18:27,204 --> 01:18:28,184
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm against the budget.

687
01:18:28,604 --> 01:18:33,106
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'd just like to say, I started at the school in 2017 as a substitute, and it paid $14,500.

688
01:18:38,204 --> 01:18:42,767
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know it's up a little bit more, but it's not just substitutes we need.

689
01:18:42,827 --> 01:18:48,971
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to have a presence in the hallway at all times.

690
01:18:50,332 --> 01:18:52,853
[SPEAKER_10]: We talk about COVID, we talk about post-COVID.

691
01:18:54,114 --> 01:18:55,275
[SPEAKER_10]: How long that's going to take?

692
01:18:56,428 --> 01:18:58,109
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I don't think it's going to take one year.

693
01:18:58,169 --> 01:19:00,471
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's probably going to take a cycle of high school.

694
01:19:01,012 --> 01:19:09,619
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we really have to start with the kids that aren't even in high school yet and basically let them understand that they're not going to get to Medford High and walk around.

695
01:19:10,179 --> 01:19:12,641
[SPEAKER_10]: And unfortunately, that is the mentality.

696
01:19:13,001 --> 01:19:15,363
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have to have a presence in the hallways.

697
01:19:15,804 --> 01:19:18,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I've been doing first period every day.

698
01:19:18,746 --> 01:19:21,929
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I see the kids coming in and they don't even want to go to class.

699
01:19:23,956 --> 01:19:26,597
[SPEAKER_10]: there isn't enough of a presence in the hallway as it is.

700
01:19:27,498 --> 01:19:33,320
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've had monitors that quit because I asked them why they quit.

701
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:41,764
[SPEAKER_10]: And they said, because for the little amount I get paid, I don't want to be told to go F myself every day of my life by 16-year-old kids.

702
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:47,134
[SPEAKER_10]: You know everybody's doing the best job they can.

703
01:19:47,514 --> 01:19:56,679
[SPEAKER_10]: All of you are, we are, you know, so I don't think it's fair for anyone to point fingers, but we have obviously the means to do so now.

704
01:19:58,757 --> 01:20:00,639
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think we can overlook anything.

705
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,101
[SPEAKER_10]: We need support.

706
01:20:02,281 --> 01:20:07,326
[SPEAKER_10]: And especially starting in September, I think we have to have people at every corner of the school.

707
01:20:07,947 --> 01:20:10,550
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, sure, livable wages.

708
01:20:11,651 --> 01:20:18,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Is somebody going to come and do that for the same amount that it would, I don't know, a McDonald's worker makes?

709
01:20:18,899 --> 01:20:19,299
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

710
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:32,692
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm telling you, as somebody that is in the hallway every single day, first period, and I walk around a lot as it is, the mentality of the kids right now is that they don't have to go to class.

711
01:20:33,561 --> 01:20:33,881
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

712
01:20:34,121 --> 01:20:37,222
[SPEAKER_10]: And those of you that have kids in the school, ask them.

713
01:20:37,263 --> 01:20:39,303
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to tell you that what I'm saying is true.

714
01:20:39,804 --> 01:20:44,786
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have to put some amount towards fixing that.

715
01:20:46,286 --> 01:20:48,787
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I mean, is the boat sinking?

716
01:20:49,047 --> 01:20:49,427
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

717
01:20:49,527 --> 01:20:50,288
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's holes in it.

718
01:20:50,948 --> 01:20:53,389
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's all I wanted to say.

719
01:20:53,789 --> 01:20:57,029
[SPEAKER_10]: And everybody's made great points tonight.

720
01:20:58,710 --> 01:21:00,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever you have to do, do it.

721
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:03,451
[SPEAKER_10]: But I just wanted you to hear it from somebody that is in the halls every day.

722
01:21:03,531 --> 01:21:05,711
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for listening to me.

723
01:21:06,511 --> 01:21:06,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

724
01:21:06,831 --> 01:21:07,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it.

725
01:21:15,873 --> 01:21:16,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Lou.

726
01:21:16,773 --> 01:21:18,314
[SPEAKER_05]: If there are no more.

727
01:21:19,884 --> 01:21:24,425
[SPEAKER_05]: In opposition, just call it last call for opposition to this budget.

728
01:21:26,566 --> 01:21:33,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearing and seeing none, we'll close that portion of the public hearing and open up to the body for any comments or motions.

729
01:21:33,567 --> 01:21:34,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

730
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:35,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

731
01:21:36,948 --> 01:21:39,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to say thank you for everyone who came out tonight.

732
01:21:40,789 --> 01:21:44,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't expect this many people to be here, so I lost a bet.

733
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:48,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, but thank you for being here because the room should always be this full.

734
01:21:51,607 --> 01:22:01,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we heard a lot of really good, passionate points tonight, and I think we all have really high expectations and hopes for our public schools.

735
01:22:02,532 --> 01:22:08,875
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of things I'm particularly hopeful about is we have just hired three new female principals.

736
01:22:10,456 --> 01:22:15,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Marta Cabral will be the first female principal of Medford High ever.

737
01:22:15,982 --> 01:22:17,123
[SPEAKER_03]: She's wonderful.

738
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:22,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I have such high hopes for Medford High under her leadership.

739
01:22:22,645 --> 01:22:25,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I know she's already in close communication with the superintendent.

740
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:36,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I also know Malden High had to reindate their graduation, so you won't get to meet her tonight, I don't think, because she has to organize and execute Malden High graduation.

741
01:22:37,612 --> 01:22:42,695
[SPEAKER_03]: To the point that we need to work together to understand what the city needs

742
01:22:43,382 --> 01:22:44,142
[SPEAKER_03]: I am in agreement.

743
01:22:45,163 --> 01:22:52,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this group, this committee has worked really hard for the four years that I've been here to authentically describe what we need.

744
01:22:52,605 --> 01:22:54,385
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really never done before.

745
01:22:54,405 --> 01:22:57,286
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has been a collective effort.

746
01:22:57,326 --> 01:22:58,426
[SPEAKER_03]: It has included the mayor.

747
01:22:58,967 --> 01:23:00,147
[SPEAKER_03]: It has never been easy.

748
01:23:01,807 --> 01:23:03,068
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanna acknowledge that.

749
01:23:04,468 --> 01:23:07,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to make a motion for consideration of the group.

750
01:23:09,089 --> 01:23:10,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to make a motion to request

751
01:23:12,347 --> 01:23:14,869
[SPEAKER_03]: to make our request to the municipal government in the amount of $71,995,165.

752
01:23:14,909 --> 01:23:19,473
[SPEAKER_03]: The request includes the superintendent's request of $71,835,165 and the addition of two more literacy coaches to equal four in total.

753
01:23:19,493 --> 01:23:21,255
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a lot of conversation about literacy coaches.

754
01:23:36,291 --> 01:24:01,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Further, the requested amount, when paired with the remaining ESSER funding, if the full request is funded, will provide us the capacity not only to hire four literacy coaches, a new person in the Parent Information Center, to convert our librarians to librarians, to add a theater teacher, but it will also allow us the bandwidth and the capacity to fully implement the climate recommendations of

755
01:24:03,157 --> 01:24:09,578
[SPEAKER_03]: the report from Mr. Michael Welch in a variety of ways.

756
01:24:10,558 --> 01:24:12,999
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is the motion I'd like to make.

757
01:24:13,019 --> 01:24:16,760
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need me to repeat it, I'm happy to do that.

758
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:17,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Graham.

759
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:18,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin?

760
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:21,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you repeat specifically the additional amount?

761
01:24:22,061 --> 01:24:29,222
[SPEAKER_04]: And I heard the rest of the piece, but specifically the additional amount, and I would like to just respond to that for one moment, if you'd just give that number again.

762
01:24:29,702 --> 01:24:29,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

763
01:24:30,741 --> 01:24:38,605
[SPEAKER_03]: The additional amount is effectively $160,000 to include the two more literacy coaches.

764
01:24:39,046 --> 01:24:43,468
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's the superintendent's number on the first page of your packet, 71835165 plus 160,000 to equal 71995165.

765
01:24:43,508 --> 01:24:43,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

766
01:24:44,008 --> 01:24:45,669
[SPEAKER_03]: May I make an amendment?

767
01:24:45,689 --> 01:24:48,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to propose an amendment to that resolution.

768
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:09,894
[SPEAKER_04]: and that is 50K to implement the non-discrimination agreement that we all voted on for the wraparound services before and after school and any in-school activities.

769
01:25:10,514 --> 01:25:23,124
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would request an additional 50,000 to ensure that we are keeping our ADA regulations as proposed, and also that we are being non-exclusive and committing to our equity across the school district.

770
01:25:23,925 --> 01:25:24,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information.

771
01:25:25,266 --> 01:25:26,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Member Rossell.

772
01:25:27,457 --> 01:25:29,697
[SPEAKER_13]: Where does the number 50,000 come from?

773
01:25:30,038 --> 01:25:55,222
[SPEAKER_04]: The 50K would be specifically for additional staffing at any of the programs, including afterschool, the summer fun and summer enrichment before school, for whether it be BCBA, school adjustment counselor, whatever the district deems necessary to be sure that we are being inclusive of

774
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:06,852
[SPEAKER_04]: all of our student population in those activities, particularly regarding the additional supports or additional support requests that we're going to be putting on all of our outgoing paperwork.

775
01:26:07,533 --> 01:26:12,739
[SPEAKER_04]: So specifically right now it's to give it a run for this year to see if that amount is

776
01:26:14,733 --> 01:26:37,132
[SPEAKER_04]: enough or in the ballpark, but just to at least initiate that I know what the after school I mean at the summer fund program for the camp they have no BCBA they have no paraprofessionals they have no staffing and a number of families have, you know, frankly, had to not go there because there's no additional support, or, you know, it's been problematic for students that have gone there.

777
01:26:38,713 --> 01:26:40,336
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that that's a number to start.

778
01:26:40,356 --> 01:26:47,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that number is necessarily going to fill it, but I think we have to make the commitment that we said we were going to make to ensuring equity for all of our students.

779
01:26:50,369 --> 01:26:51,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

780
01:26:51,791 --> 01:26:55,116
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I don't have any problem with the number, but

781
01:26:55,725 --> 01:26:59,307
[SPEAKER_13]: the budget has line items and it has to go somewhere in the line item on a budget.

782
01:26:59,487 --> 01:27:06,371
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know, it seems like that number, whether it's high or low is not really my point.

783
01:27:06,872 --> 01:27:13,276
[SPEAKER_13]: My point is, I don't think we could just add money that doesn't go somewhere in the budget.

784
01:27:13,896 --> 01:27:20,140
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I don't, so looking at the budget that we were sent, where would that get added?

785
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:23,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there's no like line item for,

786
01:27:24,616 --> 01:27:29,497
[SPEAKER_13]: that there's no line item at the moment for the specific thing that you have mentioned, so.

787
01:27:29,717 --> 01:27:34,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, question member McLaughlin.

788
01:27:35,759 --> 01:27:51,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I would suggest to the rest of the committee that it could start with community schools, afterschool and athletics, but that's where we're seeing a lot of the differences in equity and support.

789
01:27:52,762 --> 01:27:58,826
[SPEAKER_04]: sorry, differences in equity and supports, but I would defer to the committee as a whole to be thinking about where those line items could go.

790
01:27:59,506 --> 01:27:59,806
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor?

791
01:28:01,267 --> 01:28:03,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham?

792
01:28:04,509 --> 01:28:07,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree that we need to do all of those things.

793
01:28:07,170 --> 01:28:19,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have a unique funding opportunity for those items because all of those programs run out of our revolving funds, and so they do not have to be part of this request in order for us to fund them.

794
01:28:19,357 --> 01:28:20,278
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think instead,

795
01:28:20,902 --> 01:28:49,535
[SPEAKER_03]: what we may wanna do is request that the superintendent provide us a report of how many of those folks are planned for summer fund, for after school, for next year, et cetera, and whether there is sufficient money in the revolving accounts, if there are none planned to add, so that it doesn't, it's not $50,000 in the operating budget, because all of that, all of those expenses really do need to sit in the revolving accounts, and there very likely is adequate funding there.

796
01:28:50,069 --> 01:28:52,090
[SPEAKER_03]: to say that this is a priority and we should do it.

797
01:28:56,153 --> 01:28:56,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

798
01:28:57,234 --> 01:29:05,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a good point I believe we did make a motion and I was just flipping through our notes but I would have to have more time to look at that to get that information actually to find out about the revolving accounts.

799
01:29:06,584 --> 01:29:15,246
[SPEAKER_04]: for that reason, at least from my perspective, it was for that reason, but also to be more transparent and to understand what the income revenue is from the revolving accounts.

800
01:29:15,766 --> 01:29:21,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say that it's not just community, you know, the revolving accounts that this material comes from, but it's certainly a good start.

801
01:29:22,308 --> 01:29:35,731
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would be willing to withdraw the recommended amendment based on the fulfillment of the report that we're talking about and how we're going to address that in September.

802
01:29:36,914 --> 01:29:47,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Superintendent member Graham is that is it possible for you to provide us some sort of brief report next Monday about this topic, particularly.

803
01:29:47,683 --> 01:29:57,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Particularly interested in summer fun, because it is imminent and whether the revolving account can support bcba support for summer fun this upcoming summer.

804
01:29:58,325 --> 01:30:04,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I will work with member McLaughlin to get some additional clarity and guidance.

805
01:30:05,848 --> 01:30:11,531
[SPEAKER_02]: But we should be able to work with that with our revolving account for those special programs.

806
01:30:12,071 --> 01:30:13,232
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm in agreement with that.

807
01:30:13,252 --> 01:30:15,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mayor.

808
01:30:15,553 --> 01:30:22,636
[SPEAKER_05]: So motions with john motion on the floor by member Graham member Ruseau second that but I also just asked for the number for one more time 71,995,165.

809
01:30:27,168 --> 01:30:32,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Million is the request of the school committee motion by member Graham, seconded by member Ruseau.

810
01:30:33,169 --> 01:30:41,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Before the roll is called, I'd just like to state that I'm different position for me as I'm the chair of the school committee, as well as the mayor.

811
01:30:41,611 --> 01:30:48,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I already have been crunching numbers with our CFO because we obviously want to do all we can for the schools.

812
01:30:49,133 --> 01:30:56,034
[SPEAKER_05]: The initial number of 71 million came very early on because I did want to give the schools a starting place.

813
01:30:56,870 --> 01:31:02,553
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that there's certain funds that come from the state and some were higher this year, some were lower.

814
01:31:02,713 --> 01:31:08,155
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's all is implemented into that 71 million.

815
01:31:08,195 --> 01:31:09,536
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to be clear on that.

816
01:31:09,836 --> 01:31:12,857
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to let you know why I'm going to abstain, but I appreciate the committee.

817
01:31:12,877 --> 01:31:16,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate everybody being here to voice their concerns.

818
01:31:16,619 --> 01:31:23,102
[SPEAKER_05]: We all want to fund a strong school district, a safe school district, and I have a little bit of work I need to do.

819
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:31,103
[SPEAKER_05]: behind the scenes over the next week or two, but we're always here to listen and we understand the needs of not just the schools, but of the city.

820
01:31:31,704 --> 01:31:39,507
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why it's good we work well together, the school committee and I've been, I just appeared at the city council meeting also.

821
01:31:39,607 --> 01:31:50,552
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have some discussions that need to be had between members of each body and myself on potential ways to obtain more funding for the community as we know we need it.

822
01:31:51,161 --> 01:31:54,224
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, I just asked that you call the role.

823
01:31:54,624 --> 01:32:03,272
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember so I did want to answer the question that a speaker, Mr. Guillaume asked, and he asked where the missing.

824
01:32:04,132 --> 01:32:09,037
[SPEAKER_13]: So the thing that was being referenced was that the chapter 70 or the state aid to education.

825
01:32:09,557 --> 01:32:14,481
[SPEAKER_13]: that flows to cities, and is not required for the cities to send it to the schools.

826
01:32:15,001 --> 01:32:16,983
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish the state would do something about that.

827
01:32:18,283 --> 01:32:36,317
[SPEAKER_13]: So, the increase this year over last year from this is the increase this isn't the total amount, the increase this year is $3.3 million increase in state aid to education, the state did what we expected of them with the millionaires tax.

828
01:32:37,037 --> 01:32:40,362
[SPEAKER_13]: They sent us way more of an increase than we've probably ever seen.

829
01:32:41,563 --> 01:32:51,317
[SPEAKER_13]: However, that money did not flow into the schools, and that is completely legal and within the authority of the administration, but that is the answer to.

830
01:32:53,903 --> 01:33:00,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Where it went, it went, it goes to the same place it always goes into the city coffers, but it did not come to the schools.

831
01:33:01,389 --> 01:33:07,113
[SPEAKER_13]: And that that's a policy decision for which the school committee has no authority so I just wanted to answer that question.

832
01:33:08,374 --> 01:33:13,458
[SPEAKER_13]: I did second that motion for the new number, but can I can I just say one more thing.

833
01:33:14,759 --> 01:33:18,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, remember if you don't mind just just on that, like I said, some, some,

834
01:33:19,409 --> 01:33:41,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Income is higher some is lower and then we take the totality of the last four years with far more increase on the school side than the city side so there had to be at some point of balancing out of the 9% one year where we increase the schools 9% and I cut from the city side, it's just balancing out now we're going to see major layoffs and on the city side so we're

835
01:33:41,957 --> 01:33:43,638
[SPEAKER_05]: we're doing our best, but member Graham.

836
01:33:44,618 --> 01:33:57,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I wanted to say unequivocally that as you have this conversation about what override is needed in my, I feel the pain of $3 million easily right here in the school.

837
01:33:57,684 --> 01:34:04,887
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that we probably need much, much more than that, but as soon as we're ready to start that conversation, count me in.

838
01:34:05,922 --> 01:34:12,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I will knock every door in the city myself if I need to to pass an override because I think as a city, we deserve it.

839
01:34:12,844 --> 01:34:14,285
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I already counted.

840
01:34:14,325 --> 01:34:15,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

841
01:34:15,425 --> 01:34:15,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.

842
01:34:15,925 --> 01:34:31,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Um but II did want to say and I think, you know, this is a great point for everybody listening and who has come to participate tonight like it there there is only so much that we can do in the right now but what we can do is plan for the future and so I think we have to sort of balance both of those

843
01:34:34,514 --> 01:34:34,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

844
01:34:35,355 --> 01:34:36,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call vote, please.

[SPEAKER_05]: We went a little bit over time, but it was worth it.

864
01:35:04,465 --> 01:35:12,072
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just ask everybody if you have conversations, please have them in the hall we have some students here to with a couple presentations so thank you very much.
