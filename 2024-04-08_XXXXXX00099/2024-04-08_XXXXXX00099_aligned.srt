1
00:00:02,315 --> 00:00:04,276
All right, thank you both for being with me today.

2
00:00:04,576 --> 00:00:08,898
If you don't mind just introducing yourselves with your name, pronouns, and who you are.

3
00:00:10,739 --> 00:00:11,360
Thank you so much.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,541
My name is Kit Collins.

5
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:18,423
My pronouns are she, her, and I am the Vice President of the Medford City Council.

6
00:00:19,624 --> 00:00:21,325
Hello, my name is Matt Lemming.

7
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,966
My pronouns are he, him.

8
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:27,088
I'm a member of the Medford City Council.

9
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,370
All right, Ken, Matt, thanks for being with me.

10
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:37,733
Today, I think we're going to get into like kind of the nuts and bolts about the real estate transfer fee that you've heard a lot about recently.

11
00:00:38,653 --> 00:00:41,514
But before we do that, I'm going to ask you the podcast's famous question.

12
00:00:41,554 --> 00:00:46,175
So if you could share your favorite place to eat in Medford and what you like to eat there.

13
00:00:48,978 --> 00:00:54,363
My favorite place to eat is, I'd say, Oasis Cafe.

14
00:00:54,383 --> 00:01:04,452
I have a cup of coffee of theirs right now, and I also like to get the pollen de chuva, which is the little doughnuts that they sell there.

15
00:01:04,572 --> 00:01:07,555
I typically will just go there and read a magazine every morning.

16
00:01:10,828 --> 00:01:11,669
That sounds so nice.

17
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:15,291
Um, I try to have a different answer every time I come on the podcast.

18
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:20,334
Uh, lately I've been thinking about, um, grep cafe bakery on Salem street.

19
00:01:20,394 --> 00:01:24,296
Last time I was there, I had like the most amazing banana bread and I need to get back there soon.

20
00:01:25,577 --> 00:01:25,737
Yeah.

21
00:01:25,777 --> 00:01:26,537
Lots of new options.

22
00:01:26,597 --> 00:01:29,419
Every time we talk, I think there's something new to, to try.

23
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,840
Um, thank you.

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:39,885
So yeah, if we could start by just, um, if one of you could explain a little bit about what, what we're talking about when we say the real estate transfer fee.

25
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:46,139
Sure, I can get into some of the nuts and bolts of that.

26
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:56,169
So basically, the real estate transfer fee is a proposed policy by which any time

27
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:07,963
property above a certain price threshold or with certain exemptions is bought and sold within the city, between 0.5 and 2% of that would go into the Affordable Housing Trust.

28
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:22,395
Now, this is a proposal that has been proposed in 18 other communities.

29
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:28,919
Cities, by default, do not have the option to implement the real estate transfer fee on their own.

30
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:30,881
They need to petition the state for that.

31
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:39,946
So they've requested that the state give them the option to craft a real estate transfer fee policy, and Medford

32
00:02:41,647 --> 00:03:00,045
recently introduced a resolution by which we're going to develop our own Home Rule petition, and if it is successful and if we can agree on one, we will then pass that along to our state delegation and hope that it passes the State House.

33
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:05,470
Concurrently, there's also a few other things happening with this.

34
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:19,843
So, Governor Mara Healey is working with the State House as well to craft the Affordable Homes Act, and she is pushing to have a real estate transfer fee option by default in there, by which

35
00:03:21,043 --> 00:03:32,106
If it is included in the AHA, then municipalities within the state would get the option to implement their own real estate transfer fee by default.

36
00:03:32,126 --> 00:03:41,028
And so in that situation, presumably all the home rule petitions would be rejected and everybody would just get the option to craft the transfer fee on their own.

37
00:03:41,448 --> 00:03:50,650
This is pretty pertinent because we've seen in different cities in Massachusetts and across the country and the world that

38
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:56,012
Real estate speculation has really taken off.

39
00:03:57,372 --> 00:04:06,156
The housing market's broken, supply is constrained, and it takes a lot of money to fund the development of affordable housing.

40
00:04:06,176 --> 00:04:14,879
A recent analysis by the Boston Globe's Spotlight team found that in greater Boston, it takes between $500,000 and $600,000 to make

41
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,621
to develop one unit of housing.

42
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:42,694
The reasons for that are very complicated, just it's reflective of the state of the economy, the shortage of labor, but we're at a point right now where there's historically been very little investment in this area and we need to come up with every revenue stream that we can to show that we're serious about addressing this problem.

43
00:04:44,922 --> 00:04:49,245
So that is an explanation of the nuts and bolts of it.

44
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:54,349
Depending on the municipality, there tends to be a lot of exemptions to these things.

45
00:04:54,529 --> 00:05:04,516
So the debates around this are typically, you know, what are the thresholds above which the real estate transfer fee would apply?

46
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:12,162
So typically municipalities will say, you don't, they might say, you know, this only applies to

47
00:05:14,003 --> 00:05:25,268
Residences above a million dollars, or others have proposed to have an owner-occupied exclusion, exclusions for vulnerable seniors, so on and so forth.

48
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:28,810
Cambridge proposed one that has exclusions for first-time homebuyers.

49
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:34,032
So it does tend to be crafted so that it doesn't target the average homeowner.

50
00:05:34,072 --> 00:05:39,575
It's really targeted more towards high-end real estate and speculation.

51
00:05:40,195 --> 00:05:48,641
So that is the sort of nuts and bolts, what we're seeing in City Hall at the moment.

52
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:49,742
And yeah.

53
00:05:49,762 --> 00:05:51,904
Can I ask one question?

54
00:05:52,944 --> 00:05:58,628
So the fee is to the person who's selling the home?

55
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:00,390
So typically, yeah.

56
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,693
It's typically split between the buyer and the seller in most proposals.

57
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:11,797
A lot of proposals are structured as having a 2% fee.

58
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,139
I've never seen a proposal that has more than 2%.

59
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:16,260
And it's split.

60
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:22,683
And the way it's structured is 1% is paid by the buyer, 1% is paid by the seller.

61
00:06:23,244 --> 00:06:34,150
If there is an exclusion for vulnerable seniors, for instance, then in that case, the vulnerable senior selling the house wouldn't pay their 1%, but the buyer would still pay their 1%.

62
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:41,571
And again, these are all just proposals, what I've seen in other, what I've seen other municipalities say.

63
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:51,260
And if you don't mind, if I jump in here, I am one of those people who needs to hear everything phrased like at least two different ways to really understand it.

64
00:06:51,340 --> 00:07:11,552
So typically when I talk about home rule petitions, whether in this case, it's for the real estate transfer fee or for any other topic that we've brought up in the time that I've been on the city council, the way that I tend to think about it and talk about it to other folks, cause it's a bit of a, it's one of those like city terms that sounds a little wonky,

65
00:07:13,412 --> 00:07:24,014
Just to make it really clear, when we say a home rule petition, that's when a city, in this case ours, is asking the state for permission to do something that it ordinarily doesn't have permission to do.

66
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:42,198
So when we talk about a real estate petition being granted at the state level, that's if the state were to say, okay, 18 cities and towns that have submitted these home rule petitions, we're granting them, that means you now have special permission to enact this real estate transfer fee that you have proposed for your community.

67
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:57,979
And the alternative way that it could potentially go if it goes any of these ways that Matt was describing is if it's rendered as a local option under law, that means, okay, you don't have to raise your hand and ask for special permission anymore.

68
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,702
Under state law, you can take this option, you can opt in if you want to, without passing a home rule petition.

69
00:08:05,182 --> 00:08:16,865
Of course, there's always the option that neither of these happen, but I just like to sort of frame it in a different way for folks who might be newer to these kind of technical terms about how legislation and policy gets done.

70
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:20,586
And I think it's also just really important to underline

71
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:31,674
you know, that these proposals for the home rule, even the proposal still in Maura Healey's, Governor Healey's Affordable Homes Act, these are tweakable.

72
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:43,763
We're talking about a tool that the goal of which is to take a little tiny percentage off the top of just these real estate transactions that are luxury real estate transactions.

73
00:08:44,563 --> 00:08:49,587
We're trying to tailor it so that it is targeting really the luxury real estate transactions.

74
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:50,448
We have to talk about

75
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:53,390
know, how to tailor it so that it is capturing only those.

76
00:08:54,010 --> 00:09:07,058
But we're in a moment where housing, something that everybody in Bedford needs, something that is a human right, something that is non-negotiable, has become, as Councilor Lemming said, this speculative item, this commodity.

77
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:09,759
And we're trying to say, what can we do?

78
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,940
How can we craft this?

79
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,522
How can we phrase it so that this tool would target

80
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:33,176
these sales that are really high ticket, that are really luxury, where there's really profits being made and say, for the good of our community, we need to capture a little bit of that profit that increasingly is going not to people,

81
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:39,649
not to longtime residents, but to for profit developers and say, we need one or 2% of that.

82
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:45,292
So that longtime Medford residents can stay in Medford, and so that we can welcome new neighbors of all economic backgrounds.

83
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:48,114
Thank you.

84
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:55,719
And so, so what's happening in city council, it sounds like maybe you can help me like understand kind of your your

85
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:14,283
working on this whole new petition or you're gaining you're kind of gaining like insight into what you would ask for in the home of petition like how does that work like where are you kind of now with um with this kind of motion here right so so the only thing that's happened in city council in any official meeting is that

86
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:27,733
We, at the March 12th meeting, we had a resolution to discuss the formation of the homeroom petition, and the resolution was about, was four lines long.

87
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:38,280
We debated it, we heard public comment, the meeting lasted until 1am, and we ended up voting to refer it to the Planning and Permitting Committee.

88
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:51,573
What would then happen is at a planning and permitting committee meeting, one of us would introduce a draft of what the home rule petition would look like.

89
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:55,537
It would then be debated by different members in the planning and permitting committee and then

90
00:10:56,795 --> 00:11:15,024
Presumably, if we end up agreeing on it, it would then be referred out of committee to another regular session where it would then be voted on, then signed off by the mayor and handed to the state delegation.

91
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:16,765
That's the full process.

92
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:18,146
We're at step one.

93
00:11:19,235 --> 00:11:24,060
It was originally introduced at the February 20th meeting, but it was tabled at that meeting.

94
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:32,009
So, you know, there was a bit of a delay prior to it actually being heard for the first time in regular session at all on March 12th.

95
00:11:34,083 --> 00:12:01,208
Thank you, yes, so a lot of steps and sounds like some room for input, but can you give us a sense about, I think the, when we, like the term affordable housing, like can bring up different things for people, but I don't really have a great sense of where Medford stands in terms of like affordable housing that already exists or what the sort of work looks like, or like kind of what, why is this so important to like, to affordable housing in Medford?

96
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:05,169
So affordable housing is a, it's a legal term.

97
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:08,690
Uh, it's actually defined under Massachusetts general law.

98
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:21,293
It refers to, it refers at the, uh, at minimum to housing that people that is only occupied by people whose household income is at 80% of area median income.

99
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:25,414
So in Medford, that would be, I think between 80 and $90,000.

100
00:12:25,514 --> 00:12:29,495
Um, and there's, there's other standards for it too.

101
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,335
So there's a standard that I've heard,

102
00:12:32,896 --> 00:12:35,298
that I've heard referred to as a deeply affordable housing.

103
00:12:35,318 --> 00:12:47,807
And that's where it's for very low income people who put no more than 30% of their income towards rent and the rest is subsidized.

104
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:51,390
And so that's where you start getting into like section eight housing, for instance.

105
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:57,754
So when we say affordable housing, it's actually referring to a very specific legal term.

106
00:12:58,074 --> 00:12:58,235
Now,

107
00:12:58,955 --> 00:13:10,366
My colleague, Council Vice President Collins, and the previous City Council only implemented something called an affordable housing trust last year.

108
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:14,309
Now this trust is basically it's a

109
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:20,234
pool of, it's a pool of money that is used for affordable housing needs.

110
00:13:20,274 --> 00:13:37,768
And this could be development, it could be helping to, you know, if you're trying, if like for instance somebody wants to sell an apartment complex or a house, it's, you could potentially encourage them to sell it to an affordable housing non-profit with some money from the trust.

111
00:13:38,488 --> 00:14:00,189
uh if that's that's a perfectly legitimate way of using it uh or you could use it for i mean pretty much anything that would help affordable housing needs in the city but the point is medford is really kind of uh behind the ball uh behind the curve on this one you know there have been other other communities implemented affordable housing trusts

112
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:13,022
30, 40 years ago, and this whole time, these trusts have been collecting money to supplement affordable housing efforts, and Medford really needs to come up with the infrastructure to fund our own.

113
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:29,774
I think that it's helpful to bring up sort of where we are at this point in time with, you know, having very recently implemented the affordable housing trust ordinance because when we zoom out and look at a big picture.

114
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:48,672
Cities have the option to create affordable housing trusts, cause this is a problem that the market is not solving, like that is why we have that tool that is why we pass these ordinances here in Medford, as in a lot of the greater Boston region, you know we're certainly not unique in this regard.

115
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:57,836
But we have way, way, way more people who need affordable housing who are by their income eligible for affordable or subsidized housing.

116
00:14:58,716 --> 00:14:59,817
And there's not enough to go around.

117
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:07,200
This was captured in our housing production plan, which is a document that the city's planning department worked on for a few years and put out.

118
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:22,104
a year ago, it captures kind of the percentage of Medford residents that by their income need affordable housing at some rate and can't access it because we don't have enough housing units that are affordable.

119
00:15:22,404 --> 00:15:24,565
And when we ask the question of like, what is affordable housing?

120
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:28,086
Like when I look around the city, when I walk around my neighborhood, what is it?

121
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,666
Will I know it when I see it?

122
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,987
The answer is like, you know, inclusive, yes.

123
00:15:34,307 --> 00:15:36,088
I think a lot of people are familiar with

124
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:41,393
Um, some of the public housing that exists in Medford because we're really lucky to have so much of it.

125
00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:55,887
Um, one of the real gems of the City Council for, like, this term and the past term has been being able to sign off on funding for the Walkland Court redevelopment, which will add, um, more units of affordable housing to the community.

126
00:15:55,907 --> 00:15:56,888
It will add new

127
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:03,913
Um household size disabled accessible affordable housing to the community.

128
00:16:03,933 --> 00:16:08,815
Um it will renovate these public uh affordable housing units.

129
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:19,081
This is really important like and that is that is something that we can be really proud of in terms of making progress towards our affordable housing goals and getting to a point where supply is meeting demand.

130
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:22,142
But affordable housing can look like a lot of other things too.

131
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:26,565
As Councilor Lemming mentioned um you know some units um

132
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:33,088
are advertised as, are intended to be affordable at different income levels.

133
00:16:33,548 --> 00:16:44,173
The apartment that I live in, I believe, or at least it was a couple years ago, was technically affordable at 80% AMI, which means it's affordable for people who make 80% of area median income.

134
00:16:44,614 --> 00:16:45,654
I didn't have to apply for that.

135
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:47,215
Frankly, I got really lucky.

136
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:53,501
I'm still, you know, candidly, and I share this because this is true for a lot, a lot, a lot of tenants like me in Medford.

137
00:16:53,942 --> 00:16:58,166
I'm still burdened by housing costs because I don't make 80% of area median income.

138
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:04,953
But the point is, that is true for more people in Medford than there are affordable units to put them in.

139
00:17:05,434 --> 00:17:09,298
So some of them occur because of the market, because of what's being developed.

140
00:17:10,018 --> 00:17:13,719
Some of them occur because there's, sorry, because there's public housing.

141
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:18,721
But overall, neither of those forces are getting us close to what we need.

142
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:26,263
And under Chapter 40B of Mass General Law, cities have to have at least 10% of their housing units be affordable.

143
00:17:26,623 --> 00:17:27,804
We are not at that threshold.

144
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:30,785
So even by that, I think really honestly, really minimal,

145
00:17:31,805 --> 00:17:35,646
kind of regional level statistic, we do not have as much as we need.

146
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:50,410
And that is kind of the background for a lot of these measures that the council is debating for what can we do to try to push this in a direction where the housing in Medford is at a level where Medford residents can actually afford to live in it.

147
00:17:53,574 --> 00:18:09,980
Yeah, and just to get a little bit more into the nitty gritty numbers behind the chapter be chapter 40 be a 10% requirement so the as of 2020 Medford's housing production plan said that.

148
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,563
we are about 671 units short of that 10% requirement.

149
00:18:16,623 --> 00:18:20,624
Now that's, I think, that's partially going to be mitigated by the Watling Court development.

150
00:18:20,644 --> 00:18:27,067
That's partially going to be mitigated by some of the 40B developments on on Fellsway in the future.

151
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:39,953
But the point is that that 10% is very much a, is still very much a minimum and we're not even at that even if those, even if those do come through.

152
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:56,901
The housing market is a little bit unique because in terms of just economics because the supply and like normally these things are kind of mitigated by supply and demand.

153
00:18:57,641 --> 00:18:58,662
The problem with

154
00:18:59,382 --> 00:19:20,536
real estate, especially in places like greater Boston, is that the supply is oftentimes artificially constrained, be it sometimes that's by zoning laws, sometimes that's just by cost, and oftentimes it's just by the cold hard reality that you can't make more land.

155
00:19:21,017 --> 00:19:23,238
And so what's sort of been happening in

156
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:37,608
recent years is that a lot of people, like a lot of people, sort of private equity have been investing in real estate almost as like a gold bar.

157
00:19:38,008 --> 00:19:40,189
So just basically a storage of wealth.

158
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:40,810
And in

159
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:51,355
really high-end areas like New York, London, this has led to a lot of vacant units.

160
00:19:51,375 --> 00:20:05,141
I don't think that that's really quite as direct a problem in Medford, but because of our proximity to some of these areas where there is very high-end real estate, it tends to raise the price.

161
00:20:07,422 --> 00:20:08,723
Basically, what that means is that

162
00:20:09,711 --> 00:20:29,243
It is very much a priority for us to do something about the supply issue and try to come up with as many means as we can to raise the supply so that, you know, it's not just biotech workers, lawyers, white collar workers who can afford to live here.

163
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:44,146
It's service workers, teachers, the people who repair our roads, who fix our infrastructure, who are able to afford to live here, and just make sure that they have a place here and they're not going to be priced out in the long term.

164
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:48,343
I think that Councilor Leving summed it up really well.

165
00:20:48,543 --> 00:20:57,185
The point here is not that we, it's like nothing against biotech workers and white collar workers and all of that.

166
00:20:58,285 --> 00:21:09,928
I think that goes without saying, but when we talk about needing to meet and then truly we need to vastly exceed that threshold that we're almost 700 units below.

167
00:21:09,988 --> 00:21:13,549
It's certainly not the case that once we add 671, we're like good to go.

168
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:15,410
The actual need is much greater.

169
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:24,100
But, you know, I think that Councilor Lemming has put this really well in meetings and it's about keeping Medford affordable for the working class.

170
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,284
And another way that I think that I sometimes think about it is I know that

171
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,611
Living in a diverse community is something that I think everybody in Medford really cherishes.

172
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:37,693
People put that in different ways, but I know that that's a value for everybody who lives here.

173
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:51,778
And having housing that is affordable to different types of people and people who work at different jobs and people who are in different situations is a necessary precondition for living in a community that is diverse.

174
00:21:53,833 --> 00:22:07,651
And it sounds like so to come full circle, it sounds like the the revenue from the real estate transfer fee could help to like both could help with funds to both kind of like upkeep some of the affordable units that you have, but also build more units.

175
00:22:08,312 --> 00:22:08,512
Yeah.

176
00:22:10,094 --> 00:22:10,615
Yeah, so.

177
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:19,980
the real estate transfer fee revenue, should it pass, would be earmarked for the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

178
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:30,844
And what I have always found really exciting about the Affordable Housing Trust, you know, long before we started this particular conversation about one way to fund it, is that these tools are really flexible.

179
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:39,448
The funds from the Affordable Housing Trust can be allocated to be, you know, seed money for public housing developments,

180
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:48,697
They can help to recruit new affordable housing developers to Medford by providing seed money for those endeavors.

181
00:22:49,097 --> 00:22:55,944
They can also be used for affordable housing-related programs, such as rental assistance, but also for first-time homebuyer programs.

182
00:22:56,444 --> 00:22:58,567
So it's not just for building the literal units.

183
00:22:59,267 --> 00:23:00,408
It can be for lots of

184
00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:13,032
ways and avenues and different mechanisms for getting people into homes that they can afford in Medford, whether that's by helping to increase stock or by the activities and channels that get people there.

185
00:23:13,052 --> 00:23:16,233
It's really great.

186
00:23:16,753 --> 00:23:16,933
Yeah.

187
00:23:17,953 --> 00:23:24,975
And another thing that I do want to emphasize about this proposal is that the

188
00:23:26,164 --> 00:23:39,884
The real estate transfer fee proposal whatever form it does take it is one tool that city that city councils and other forms of local government have to address the housing crisis and.

189
00:23:40,905 --> 00:23:45,490
The housing crisis is a very complicated issue.

190
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:57,424
It's affected by everything from zoning ordinances, which City Council is working to completely redo this term, to the local labor shortage.

191
00:23:57,484 --> 00:24:00,207
There's just fewer people going into construction these days.

192
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:01,028
That is a reality.

193
00:24:01,488 --> 00:24:09,011
to the price of copper overseas, which is something that, of course, we have very little impact on.

194
00:24:09,971 --> 00:24:20,274
And this is just one single potential revenue stream to put into the Affordable Housing Trust.

195
00:24:20,434 --> 00:24:24,716
There's a lot of other things that we're doing.

196
00:24:25,156 --> 00:24:27,557
One thing that came up, for instance, was this idea of

197
00:24:28,657 --> 00:24:45,084
infill zoning which would allow us to put units that are smaller than normal in between pre-existing buildings even if they're not necessarily within zoning regulations.

198
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:57,269
One thing that we discussed this past week in City Council is updating Medford's linkage fee ordinance to add affordable housing to that so that developers

199
00:24:57,709 --> 00:25:04,436
that are building in Medford would have to pay a certain amount into the Affordable Housing Trust.

200
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:11,143
One thing that's also come up quite a bit is the Community Preservation Act, which is

201
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:16,982
One of the very, very few existing sources of funding for affordable housing.

202
00:25:17,722 --> 00:25:27,490
This is a fee that's paid by residents of Medford to go towards affordable housing, open space, and

203
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,211
and recreation and historic preservation projects.

204
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:44,315
About 2.4 million dollars over a three-year period of CPA funds are being used for the Walkling Court redevelopments and so that's pretty much

205
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:51,198
the only source of money that I know that Medford has put towards these developments.

206
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:59,302
And that's still only about 2% of the full cost of the Waukland Court developments overall.

207
00:25:59,342 --> 00:26:08,226
The rest is coming from state and federal grants, which should give you an idea of just how pricey these things are.

208
00:26:08,646 --> 00:26:11,488
So the point of me saying that is that

209
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:29,638
You know, the real estate transfer fee, it does tend to get a lot of attention, but it's just one potential tool in the toolbox of that city council has some impact over which can potentially address the housing crisis.

210
00:26:32,233 --> 00:26:38,155
Yeah, and I think it's so important to put it in those terms.

211
00:26:38,275 --> 00:26:52,279
Often when we talk about, on the city council, the crisis of the shortage of affordable housing, which really is a crisis proportions, and you see that in how many people are forced to move away from Medford, which I think, honestly, goes under-talked about.

212
00:26:53,159 --> 00:27:00,261
Often when we talk about any mechanism that we're currently proposing for funding affordable housing, trying to get at some aspect of this issue,

213
00:27:02,242 --> 00:27:06,786
What of course follows from that discussion is, well, but why don't we do this instead?

214
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:08,187
But why don't we do this instead?

215
00:27:08,707 --> 00:27:11,189
But why don't we, you know, use zoning instead?

216
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:11,870
But why don't we

217
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:16,635
You know, can't, you know, appropriation of CPA funding fix this?

218
00:27:17,195 --> 00:27:20,977
Can't appropriation of, you know, linkage fees fix this?

219
00:27:21,877 --> 00:27:29,501
And I think it's really important to have those conversations because it is really important to try to do an audit of what is funding affordable housing and what would be the best solve.

220
00:27:30,101 --> 00:27:35,224
And I think what's really important to be really clear about is that we need all of it.

221
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:36,904
We need all of it.

222
00:27:37,204 --> 00:27:42,527
No one of these things can solve this vast undersupply on its own.

223
00:27:43,012 --> 00:27:43,648
to the question of like,

224
00:27:44,478 --> 00:27:48,641
Why aren't we looking to zoning instead to solve the supply issue?

225
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:49,542
We are.

226
00:27:50,363 --> 00:27:50,643
We are.

227
00:27:50,683 --> 00:27:55,106
We've been working up to that for, honestly, for more terms than I've been on the city council.

228
00:27:55,126 --> 00:27:58,949
We've been working up to this zoning recodification, this zoning overhaul.

229
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,151
We're looking at other sources of funding.

230
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:13,841
The problem is just the need for housing that is either affordable or just simply at rates that's sub-luxury prices is so endemic that we need to look at all of it.

231
00:28:15,422 --> 00:28:19,864
And there's no one revenue stream that is going to solve this problem for us.

232
00:28:22,246 --> 00:28:38,175
Yeah, and the other corollary to that too, and this is why I got into the Walkland Court funding example, is that a lot of funding and a lot of help for affordable housing does come from outside sources.

233
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:38,856
So like I said,

234
00:28:40,128 --> 00:28:47,172
Of the, you know, hundred million plus price tag on the walkley court redevelopments only 2% of that came from Medford.

235
00:28:47,532 --> 00:28:55,616
Well, that not the other 98% would have never come to Medford if we had not ourselves put forth a 2% and this is a way of saying that.

236
00:28:56,917 --> 00:29:05,383
the state and federal government are more serious about dedicating resources to a community if they know that that community is itself serious about addressing this problem.

237
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:18,372
So, you know, if we end up going through a zoning recodification, we come up with multiple revenue streams for the affordable housing trust, we show that we're serious about building, then suddenly, you know, HUD,

238
00:29:19,977 --> 00:29:27,082
state government will say, okay, Medford is really serious about actually trying to address this housing crisis.

239
00:29:27,122 --> 00:29:30,464
We can see that they're not just putting lip service to this problem.

240
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,286
We should put more grant money to them.

241
00:29:33,466 --> 00:29:36,228
So this is, so, you know, these

242
00:29:38,742 --> 00:29:43,504
Yeah, when you're looking at fixing the housing crisis, you really need to look at the bigger picture.

243
00:29:43,544 --> 00:29:51,367
It's like, this is not just potentially a few hundred thousand dollars a year going into a trust.

244
00:29:51,407 --> 00:30:03,792
This is us showing other entities that we're serious about doing this, and therefore those other entities will then be more serious about helping Medford out in the future, and thus more money will come to the community.

245
00:30:07,147 --> 00:30:18,820
Thank you as you were talking about sort of the, you know, wanting to maintain like a diverse population of Medford people that do all sorts of jobs that are be able to live here and work here.

246
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,924
It made me think about sort of like the rippling effects of that so like if I didn't have to.

247
00:30:23,853 --> 00:30:29,877
travel to Cambridge to work to make enough money to live in Medford, then maybe I could, wouldn't have to drive a car to work.

248
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:32,920
And then that would cut down on like all sorts of other things.

249
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:35,902
So it really, it makes a lot of sense.

250
00:30:35,962 --> 00:30:43,848
I wonder if there's any like other kind of like main points that you want people to understand about your work on the real estate transfer fee.

251
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,911
It really,

252
00:30:51,477 --> 00:30:54,579
It really affects things locally here.

253
00:30:54,699 --> 00:31:04,684
So I know that Councilor, Council Vice President Collins can speak to this a little bit more, a little bit more intimately since she has done work on this previously.

254
00:31:04,764 --> 00:31:06,925
But what I can tell you is that the

255
00:31:07,781 --> 00:31:29,937
The same evening that we were going to just debate the initial resolution to introduce a discussion of the real estate transfer fee home rule petition, that same day I received a letter that was signed by 21 tenants from 208 Main Street and Brooks Park Apartments who had been told

256
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:52,120
that they need to be, that they had to leave their homes by the next month because their properties had been acquired by a real estate, a realty group, Charles Gate Property, Charles Gate Realty, which had,

257
00:31:53,311 --> 00:32:00,414
basically acquired their apartments, wanted to renovate them, flip them, and then told them that they had to leave.

258
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:06,876
They didn't show any plans to actually let them return at the same rents.

259
00:32:07,036 --> 00:32:08,377
And this is something that could have been

260
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:27,431
Fix and addressed earlier if Medford had put more resources to affordable housing 10 years ago, but we've frankly we've never been serious about it.

261
00:32:27,451 --> 00:32:30,555
Yeah, if I could jump in here, you know.

262
00:32:32,232 --> 00:32:51,226
To the question, Danielle, about what's most important for people to understand here, what I really want residents to come away with is we're working on this because it's urgent and because this is something that so many of our 60,000 neighbors are being affected by unaffordable housing.

263
00:32:51,286 --> 00:32:51,987
It's affecting

264
00:32:52,787 --> 00:32:57,189
Working class people who are being displaced, it's affecting families who have kids in the public schools.

265
00:32:57,789 --> 00:32:58,830
It's affecting your neighbors.

266
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,411
People are suffering because of high costs of housing.

267
00:33:01,451 --> 00:33:07,013
They don't want to have to move away from their community, their jobs, their schools, their friends, their family, but it's happening to people.

268
00:33:07,813 --> 00:33:20,851
And I don't think it's talked about enough, but we know that this is has been happening for years, and like Councilor Lemming said, we've been behind the eight ball on the strategies that we can muster as a city to try and combat a regional problem.

269
00:33:23,975 --> 00:33:32,096
out of many, I think we're going to look at every tool that we have the jurisdiction to use as a city government, again, where it's kind of a David and Goliath situation here.

270
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:35,937
We're a city with a housing and affordability crisis, and that crisis is regional.

271
00:33:36,437 --> 00:33:52,440
We're pretty hamstrung what we can do, but when we look around and we see people being forced out, yeah, we're going to look at every tool that we can use because, you know, I think that Medfordians are tired of being displaced and having their friends and neighbors and loved ones being displaced out of the community.

272
00:33:54,235 --> 00:33:56,221
I know that I am to that point.

273
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:08,846
There are a lot of cases of displacement in the community that just go unreported on, and people just don't talk about them, because I think people think of it as an individual problem.

274
00:34:09,587 --> 00:34:12,048
Oh, this is a me problem.

275
00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:20,474
My rent went up by $400, and if I were able to afford that, I could stay here, but I can't.

276
00:34:20,694 --> 00:34:21,734
So now I live in Alston.

277
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:22,755
Now I live in Lynn.

278
00:34:24,136 --> 00:34:25,277
It's not an individual problem.

279
00:34:25,837 --> 00:34:26,698
It's a market problem.

280
00:34:27,578 --> 00:34:44,823
So, you know, I think this was this was pretty publicized a couple years ago, a really similar situation to the one that Councilor Lemming just introduced happened on Bradley Road, an apartment building, naturally occurring affordable housing, where just, you know, the rental rates were below market for a long time.

281
00:34:45,343 --> 00:34:49,105
So there were a lot of residents that lived there that had been there for years.

282
00:34:49,185 --> 00:34:50,386
It was fully their home.

283
00:34:51,066 --> 00:34:51,926
The building was sold.

284
00:34:51,946 --> 00:34:56,389
That's, you know, that's a real estate transaction that a city cannot trammel on.

285
00:34:57,589 --> 00:35:02,892
The new owner decided that they wanted to renovate, or I might put in air quotes, they wanted to quote unquote renovate,

286
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,454
They said, everybody has to leave.

287
00:35:05,794 --> 00:35:08,996
And that was their legal right to say, everybody has to leave.

288
00:35:10,157 --> 00:35:11,037
And people lost their homes.

289
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,440
People were displaced far away from Medford.

290
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:18,703
And that is really a disruption.

291
00:35:18,943 --> 00:35:24,207
We know in a best case scenario, it's a disruption to work and school and community ties.

292
00:35:24,987 --> 00:35:27,849
And in a worst case scenario, that can be crippling for people.

293
00:35:27,969 --> 00:35:29,550
It can be absolutely financially crippling.

294
00:35:30,151 --> 00:35:31,572
What Councilwoman was just mentioning,

295
00:35:33,112 --> 00:35:38,995
This is something I became aware of last year, another building of naturally occurring affordable housing.

296
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:51,200
When I say naturally occurring affordable housing, I mean it's not public housing, it's just a building where the units happen to be affordable because the land, the property order decides to keep them that way, and that's really important.

297
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,281
So there's this building.

298
00:35:53,201 --> 00:35:59,322
in South Medford on Main Street, the Brooks Park Apartments, that for a really long time was naturally occurring affordable housing.

299
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:06,043
Last summer, we were alerted, some other city officials were alerted, okay, this building has been put up for sale.

300
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:09,604
We like worked super fast.

301
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:20,086
We had this like frantic 72 hours where we said, okay, like there's an affordable housing developer, property owner that's interested in buying this building.

302
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:30,389
you know, we did a letter of support from the mayor's office and a sign-on letter from the city council to say we support the sale to an affordable housing developer.

303
00:36:30,969 --> 00:36:47,375
We tried to see if there was some funding that we could put forward as sort of like seed money to say we support, you know, we'd support the funding of this sale to the affordable housing developer because they can't compete in market terms with a for-profit developer and property owner.

304
00:36:47,995 --> 00:36:59,758
We tried to work really fast to say, what can we do as a city to incentivize and encourage and support the sale of this naturally affordable housing to an owner that will keep it affordable?

305
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:01,779
But we can't force that.

306
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:05,880
And we didn't have any other tools at our disposal to make that happen.

307
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,101
So it sold to

308
00:37:09,802 --> 00:37:13,463
just a regular property owner or regular corporate property owner.

309
00:37:14,884 --> 00:37:22,086
What's happened in the past couple of weeks is that property owners said, hey, we are alleging that we're going to do renovations.

310
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:27,749
So some of you guys have 30 days to vacate your apartments and some of you guys have 60 days to vacate your apartments.

311
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:36,152
What we know for a fact is that when affordable units go away in the community,

312
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:45,829
people cannot find rents at similarly affordable rates within Medford because they don't exist.

313
00:37:47,549 --> 00:37:54,230
And so I think there's a way of having that conversation where it's like, well, they're just doing what they're allowed to do.

314
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:58,591
They are allowed to act on the terms of the leases.

315
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,791
They are allowed to renovate.

316
00:38:00,131 --> 00:38:00,691
Absolutely.

317
00:38:01,191 --> 00:38:04,532
As was the case in Bradley Road, nobody is doing anything illegal.

318
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:14,377
We can't sit here and say... You know, we have to have the conversation about what we know to be true about what will happen to these people.

319
00:38:15,037 --> 00:38:17,318
And what we know will happen is that these people will be displaced.

320
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:19,058
They'll be displaced away from the community.

321
00:38:19,098 --> 00:38:19,918
They have made their homes.

322
00:38:20,419 --> 00:38:22,759
They'll be displaced away from where their children go to school.

323
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:25,720
They'll be displaced away from their family and their jobs.

324
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,601
And I just don't think that that is something...

325
00:38:31,638 --> 00:38:38,604
that as city officials, we can really in good conscience say that we are okay with that status quo.

326
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:54,757
And so when we talk about, well, what could have possibly gone differently if we had started this journey of taking affordable housing seriously 10 years ago or 20 years ago or 30 years ago, it would have given us, not for certain, it would have given us a fighting chance

327
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:19,738
of keeping that housing as affordable in the city, either through a developer, an affordable housing developer, or by in some way trying to make it a city stewarded or owned property, or it would have given us a chance to earlier start that process of building up affordable housing stock in the community so that these residents could have a fighting chance of staying in the community at rates that they could afford.

328
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:29,843
Thank you, that's a really helpful illustration about sort of the long-term impacts of this if we can, you know, all these different solutions coming together.

329
00:39:29,863 --> 00:39:38,727
And I think other cities do this, like the building that I work in in Cambridge was gonna be up for sale and it's full of social service agencies and they were all gonna be displaced.

330
00:39:38,787 --> 00:39:47,290
And like you said, like become less accessible to the community and the Cambridge redevelopment group was able to buy our building and keep us all there and renovate it.

331
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,871
And so it does seem like,

332
00:39:50,023 --> 00:39:56,248
You know, there's there are fixes to this and it's it's hard to solve the problem of, like, people wanting to profit off the sales of these buildings.

333
00:39:56,308 --> 00:40:02,053
But if we can create a compelling case, or have like, a good 2nd option, that feels like it could be really useful.

334
00:40:03,574 --> 00:40:03,894
Thank you.

335
00:40:03,954 --> 00:40:05,555
Those are really helpful.

336
00:40:05,575 --> 00:40:06,456
Is there any way that, like.

337
00:40:07,537 --> 00:40:11,220
Residents can be involved in order to support your work on this.

338
00:40:14,222 --> 00:40:14,883
I think that.

339
00:40:16,098 --> 00:40:19,761
You know, my number one answer to that is always tell us how you feel.

340
00:40:20,422 --> 00:40:21,823
And there are a lot of ways to do that.

341
00:40:22,023 --> 00:40:26,227
I know for some people, the city council meetings are not easy to get to.

342
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,589
Our regular meetings start at 7 p.m.

343
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:29,550
every other Tuesday.

344
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:33,634
We always welcome people to show up and comment.

345
00:40:34,154 --> 00:40:35,235
You could do that on Zoom.

346
00:40:35,255 --> 00:40:35,956
You can Zoom in.

347
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:37,776
You can also show up in person.

348
00:40:38,617 --> 00:40:41,877
But you can also send email to your city councilors and the mayor.

349
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:42,698
You can call us.

350
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,138
Our contact information is on the city website.

351
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:55,921
You can also send an email to the city clerk and have your comments read aloud at a city council meeting if you can't be there in person, but you still want your voice to literally be heard.

352
00:40:57,941 --> 00:40:59,522
It is just really important.

353
00:41:00,598 --> 00:41:02,019
you know, this is a controversial issue.

354
00:41:02,299 --> 00:41:06,042
And I don't want to, I don't think that, you know, we need to say much about that.

355
00:41:06,062 --> 00:41:07,484
But I think it's important to acknowledge it.

356
00:41:08,464 --> 00:41:09,665
This is a controversial issue.

357
00:41:10,546 --> 00:41:20,694
And I think that it is, it would be the healthy functioning of the city council chambers, if it's represented that people feel really strongly about this.

358
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:23,997
I know that people feel really worried about, you know,

359
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:30,201
what different mechanisms will do to change their life or to impact plans that they have.

360
00:41:30,541 --> 00:41:36,443
But I know that the community feels really strongly about keeping Medford diverse and keeping Medford affordable.

361
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,124
And I think it's really important for us to hear that.

362
00:41:41,825 --> 00:41:44,645
And I think it's really important for people to let their voices be heard on that.

363
00:41:44,765 --> 00:41:45,366
So I would say,

364
00:41:46,626 --> 00:42:01,733
use all of those options and any others you can think of to let your voice be heard if you support the City Council at least considering every option at our disposal for adding tools to our toolbox to promote affordable housing.

365
00:42:02,994 --> 00:42:03,354
Thank you.

366
00:42:03,394 --> 00:42:05,555
Yeah, and it's

367
00:42:06,552 --> 00:42:23,441
It's very important for residents who are interested in these things to keep themselves in the loop, to let your representatives know, not just if you don't support things, but if you do support things as well.

368
00:42:23,461 --> 00:42:28,343
I think that people are more incentivized to come to

369
00:42:29,824 --> 00:42:35,027
City to council meetings to oppose certain things.

370
00:42:35,367 --> 00:42:38,649
And it's very useful to have people that

371
00:42:40,616 --> 00:42:47,939
You know, just that come along and make their voices heard if they are in support of a given initiatives.

372
00:42:48,939 --> 00:42:57,482
It's also just very important To have to make sure that you yourself are informed about the issues.

373
00:42:57,682 --> 00:42:58,863
I know that there's a

374
00:42:59,943 --> 00:43:09,388
bit of a, there's a lack of local news coverage within a lot of these municipalities that kind of like prevents that for a lot of people.

375
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:22,916
But we are trying to increase transparency and make it so that people do have some resources to figure out what City Council is up to.

376
00:43:22,956 --> 00:43:23,776
We've updated the

377
00:43:25,598 --> 00:43:29,481
agenda and city council page to make those more accessible.

378
00:43:29,501 --> 00:43:39,008
I'm chair of the resident services and public engagement committee which is working on a monthly newsletter that we're going to start publicizing next month.

379
00:43:39,468 --> 00:43:44,633
I personally have a website newsletter and a blog that I maintain on them.

380
00:43:45,393 --> 00:43:58,283
MattLemming.com just to offer my own very editorialized opinions on kind of what's happening, what City Council's working on, and just the bigger picture behind these things.

381
00:43:59,464 --> 00:44:04,508
A lot of this, a lot of the things, the tools that City Council

382
00:44:05,832 --> 00:44:13,635
can use to address the housing crisis is enactable at the local level, like zoning recodification.

383
00:44:13,675 --> 00:44:19,778
But as we've been talking about in this episode, a lot of it also goes back to the state level.

384
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:32,463
So writing your representatives and saying that you are in support of the Home Rule petition passing through the state house is also really critical for having

385
00:44:33,398 --> 00:44:38,780
for having a city council with all the appropriate tools at its disposal to address these issues.

386
00:44:40,401 --> 00:44:41,061
And is it similar?

387
00:44:41,141 --> 00:44:47,184
So I know we've talked about home rule petitions in other contexts where does the city council have to vote to send this to the statehouse?

388
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:50,025
And do they look for like a super majority in that vote?

389
00:44:53,696 --> 00:44:53,776
Yeah.

390
00:44:53,996 --> 00:45:03,062
So any home rule petition that is sent can be, to be clear, in order to send it in the first place, you do need a majority vote.

391
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:18,131
And then the mayor also has to sign off on it in order to officially send it to the state delegation, which is the state representatives and senators that fall inside of the municipality's jurisdiction.

392
00:45:18,151 --> 00:45:19,111
The state is

393
00:45:20,692 --> 00:45:23,914
free to pass it or ignore it as they please.

394
00:45:24,534 --> 00:45:33,599
And generally speaking, you do need a minimum of a majority vote, but it's more health.

395
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:38,722
It makes a better case to get it passed if it's unanimous or a super majority at the very least.

396
00:45:41,307 --> 00:45:41,807
Thank you both.

397
00:45:41,827 --> 00:45:44,748
This has been really informative for me, hopefully for other folks listening.

398
00:45:45,529 --> 00:45:50,351
And if people can reach out to you if they have questions or if they want to support your work.

399
00:45:50,431 --> 00:45:55,773
And you've both had a very busy beginning of the year, so thank you for all of your work.

400
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,394
Yeah, and thanks for being on today.

401
00:45:57,954 --> 00:45:58,894
It's been a lot of fun.

402
00:45:59,655 --> 00:46:00,075
But thank you.

403
00:46:01,138 --> 00:46:01,978
Thank you, Danielle.

404
00:46:02,018 --> 00:46:10,583
Thank you so much for having this very important outlet for local journalism in the community.

405
00:46:10,683 --> 00:46:14,725
And I look forward to the newest season of Medford Bites.

406
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:16,171
Thank you.

407
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:17,153
Thank you so much, Danielle.

408
00:46:17,193 --> 00:46:18,436
It's always a pleasure to speak with you.

409
00:46:18,456 --> 00:46:23,409
And thank you so much for providing a platform for us to talk about issues facing the community.

410
00:46:23,569 --> 00:46:25,855
And I just echo, folks can reach out to me anytime.

411
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:28,982
I also have a recent blog post about the real estate transfer fee.

412
00:46:29,544 --> 00:46:33,694
And I really welcome folks to reach out to chat about it further and ask questions.

413
00:46:34,395 --> 00:46:34,897
Thank you so much.
