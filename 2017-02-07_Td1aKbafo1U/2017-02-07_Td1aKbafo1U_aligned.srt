1
00:01:15,857 --> 00:01:16,197
February 7, 2017.

2
00:01:16,257 --> 00:01:16,957
Mr. Clerk.

3
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:50,012
Motion by Councillor Falco.

4
00:01:50,032 --> 00:01:53,253
Do we suspend the rule so to take paper out of order.

5
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:54,374
Thank you, Mr. President.

6
00:01:54,434 --> 00:01:55,354
We suspend the rule to take 16-574 on record.

7
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:07,619
Tonight the Committee of the Whole met regarding the University Accountability Act.

8
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:15,083
We had discussed it last week on the council floor and it got moved to subcommittee and we discussed it tonight and there are a number

9
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:18,763
amendments to the report.

10
00:02:20,164 --> 00:02:35,170
Of the amendments, we have that the administration provide assistance for code enforcement when we receive the report back from Tufts University, that Tufts looks into landlords registering with Tufts University.

11
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,893
Notifications be sent from the building commissioner to all realtors in Medford.

12
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:55,904
And the last amendment was that the zoning ordinance go out with the next tax bill so that everyone in the community is aware of the ordinance change with regard to the University Accountability Act.

13
00:02:56,385 --> 00:03:04,772
So at this point, I'd like to make a motion that the committee report be adopted as amended and the ordinance take its first reading.

14
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:05,932
Do we have a second?

15
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:08,294
Seconded by Councillor Naik.

16
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:08,595
Mr. Clerk.

17
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:11,057
Mr. President, just if I could.

18
00:03:12,146 --> 00:03:30,711
I think the last amendment that was offered was that a copy of the current city occupancy ordinance go out within the tax bill itself, not a copy of the ordinance that we're working on now.

19
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,112
I just want the record to reflect that.

20
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:35,053
Councilor Lococourin.

21
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:48,100
Thank you, President Carviello, and I think it was also offered that Tufts University report back to us within 30 to 45 days on the request we've made from them, even if they don't have a direct response to each and every one, that we get an update.

22
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:49,261
Thank you.

23
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:51,302
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

24
00:03:54,784 --> 00:03:55,664
Councilor DelaRusso.

25
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:56,245
Yes.

26
00:03:56,885 --> 00:03:57,625
Councilor Falco.

27
00:03:57,725 --> 00:03:57,906
Yes.

28
00:03:58,586 --> 00:03:59,106
Councilor Knight.

29
00:03:59,366 --> 00:03:59,586
Yes.

30
00:04:00,227 --> 00:04:01,087
Councilor Lococourin.

31
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:01,207
Yes.

32
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:02,388
Vice President Motts.

33
00:04:06,448 --> 00:04:33,293
Yes While we're under suspension we will take 17 0 6 5 and the chairman of licensing is councillor Scott Pelley Thank You mr. President I have a petition for common pictures licensed by Khalida Parveen

34
00:04:34,353 --> 00:04:34,853
Are they here?

35
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:38,215
Okay.

36
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:40,016
412.5 Granite Ave, Milton, Mass.

37
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:44,399
This is for Zam Zam's Restaurant, 42 Riverside Ave, Medford.

38
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:55,126
If you can just give us a little brief description of your restaurant so this council knows.

39
00:04:55,926 --> 00:05:00,489
It's going to be Indian Pakistani food at 42 Riverside Ave.

40
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:04,834
And we already have one in East Boston.

41
00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:08,477
We're running since 80 of that one.

42
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:11,019
And we're opening the new one.

43
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,800
OK, so I find everything is in order, Mr. President.

44
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:23,187
So one question I did have is, hours of operations, what time are you open, what time are you closing?

45
00:05:23,207 --> 00:05:23,607
11 to 10.30.

46
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:23,607
10.30?

47
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:24,328
OK.

48
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:28,130
So you're familiar with meth or anything after 11 that you have to ask for a special permit?

49
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:28,751
No, not at all.

50
00:05:29,692 --> 00:05:29,792
OK.

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,180
All right.

52
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,600
Thank you.

53
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,443
So, um, Mr. President, I find all the paperwork in order.

54
00:05:36,124 --> 00:05:39,406
So I moved to, uh, accept and place approval.

55
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:40,487
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

56
00:05:40,747 --> 00:05:41,067
Thank you.

57
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,129
Councilor Del Rosso.

58
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:50,254
If I could, through the chair, Mr. President, and ask the proprietor, how many varieties of naan will your restaurant offer?

59
00:05:50,794 --> 00:05:51,695
About four or five.

60
00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:53,116
Thank you very much.

61
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:54,677
Second, Mr. President,

62
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:56,404
Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

63
00:05:56,604 --> 00:05:57,185
Councilor Knight.

64
00:05:57,665 --> 00:06:03,830
Mr. President, I'd like to also point out that this restaurant will be filling a vacant storefront there at 42 Riverside Avenue.

65
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,052
Paperwork looks in order, as Councilor Scott Pelli said.

66
00:06:07,112 --> 00:06:09,774
I go along with his recommendation, move for approval, Mr. President.

67
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:13,016
On the motion of Councilor Scott Pelli, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

68
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,157
All those in favor?

69
00:06:14,497 --> 00:06:14,617
Aye.

70
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:15,798
Motion passes.

71
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:16,739
Congratulations, sir.

72
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:20,522
He's gone quick.

73
00:06:21,002 --> 00:06:22,423
While we're under suspension, 17,

74
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:33,123
067, communications from the mayor.

75
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:47,688
I'm sorry, 017-066, communications from the mayor to honorable presidents, members of city council, city hall of Medford, dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following transfer.

76
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:53,531
$50,000 to be transferred from highway materials and supplies to ordinary accounts

77
00:06:55,824 --> 00:07:11,230
010-422-5530-1539, two, personal account number 010-421-5130-1104, highway overtime.

78
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:17,992
This transfer is needed as the city performed catch-basin work rather than contracting it out.

79
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:24,214
Finance Director Alicia Nunley is present to answer any of the council's questions regarding this matter.

80
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,941
Name and address for the record, please.

81
00:07:27,642 --> 00:07:30,164
Yes, Alicia Nunley, finance director, City of Medford.

82
00:07:32,106 --> 00:07:34,047
Councillor O'Connor.

83
00:07:34,068 --> 00:07:35,469
Councillor Scarpelli.

84
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:37,130
Thank you very much.

85
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:38,451
Just a quick question.

86
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:42,475
I know that we've been talking about replacing and fixing the catch bases.

87
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:45,978
Do you know how many we're looking to fix on our own?

88
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,301
The DPW director may be able to answer that.

89
00:07:55,828 --> 00:07:56,789
Name and address of the record, sir.

90
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:00,832
Uh, my name is Brian Cameron's, the commissioner of public works for the city of Medford.

91
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:04,915
Uh, to answer the question to counselor, the initial list that we had was 32.

92
00:08:06,116 --> 00:08:07,037
We've exceeded that.

93
00:08:07,097 --> 00:08:07,637
We're now up to 38.

94
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:08,298
All right.

95
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,624
And this particular transfer would be for, uh, you know, uh, man hours as well as material.

96
00:08:16,124 --> 00:08:16,304
All right.

97
00:08:16,344 --> 00:08:18,686
To carry us through work to the end of the fiscal year.

98
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:20,728
Are we hoping to, to do all 38?

99
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:24,073
excuse me, but are we looking to complete all 38?

100
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:24,493
Okay.

101
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:26,734
No, that's what we've completed.

102
00:08:26,754 --> 00:08:27,394
Oh, we have.

103
00:08:27,454 --> 00:08:27,654
Yes.

104
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:28,035
Yeah.

105
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:28,835
The initial list.

106
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:29,235
Okay.

107
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:32,877
That I proposed, uh, uh, initially when this program began was 32.

108
00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:35,057
We've now completed 38.

109
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:35,177
Okay.

110
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:35,638
City.

111
00:08:36,318 --> 00:08:37,839
All right.

112
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:42,941
And of course, with the weather being how it is with the warm and cold, the thaw and everything.

113
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:43,381
Okay.

114
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:46,202
It's work in progress and you know, there's plenty more to do.

115
00:08:46,222 --> 00:08:46,822
All right.

116
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:47,683
Thank you.

117
00:08:47,703 --> 00:08:48,143
Okay.

118
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:51,004
Councilor Falco.

119
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:52,338
Thank you, Mr. President.

120
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,760
If I may ask Mr. Cairns a quick question.

121
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:05,989
So did you say the work was done in-house by city employees?

122
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:06,690
Yes, it was.

123
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,951
DPW Highway Division.

124
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:08,411
Great.

125
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:08,792
Perfect.

126
00:09:08,992 --> 00:09:10,934
I like to see when we do work inside.

127
00:09:11,674 --> 00:09:18,300
So how much did we save, actually, by keeping it in-house and doing it with our own employees as to contracting it out?

128
00:09:18,964 --> 00:09:20,625
I don't have that figure readily available.

129
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:24,448
I can gladly supply it, Councilor, but what is the significant amount?

130
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:25,709
That's what I'm thinking.

131
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:30,192
I know we have some talented people here that can do a lot of work.

132
00:09:30,212 --> 00:09:31,293
Very talented.

133
00:09:31,313 --> 00:09:39,399
It would be great if we had more people, but it would be interesting to see how much of a savings this would represent by doing it in-house.

134
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:40,379
So I'm glad we did it.

135
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,262
And I'm sorry, did you say how many more we have to do?

136
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,524
Okay, it's a work in progress, Councilor, with this weather here.

137
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:47,245
All right.

138
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:50,566
They keep cropping up, but we're starting to get ahead of it now.

139
00:09:50,846 --> 00:09:51,046
Okay.

140
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:52,766
Uh, you know, from the initial list.

141
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:53,366
Okay, great.

142
00:09:53,386 --> 00:09:53,786
Okay.

143
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:54,426
Thank you.

144
00:09:56,647 --> 00:09:57,227
Councilor Nights.

145
00:09:58,107 --> 00:10:00,027
Um, Mr. President, move approval of the paper.

146
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:06,869
I think that, um, the DPW director has shown that, uh, doing this work in house is going to be a cost savings for the city of Medford.

147
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:13,630
Um, it also shows that, uh, his expectations were exceeded, uh, when he initially came to this council seeking funding, um, back in the spring.

148
00:10:14,285 --> 00:10:17,107
They were looking for some funds to fix 32 catch basins.

149
00:10:17,147 --> 00:10:20,269
They fixed 32 and six more, and they continue to do the work.

150
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:21,750
I feel as though this is a good appropriation.

151
00:10:22,631 --> 00:10:32,158
Coupled with the fact that the work is being performed in-house, Mr. President, I believe that we maintain control and direction of the employees and also the ability to get them out there faster and fix any mistakes that may or may not occur.

152
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:38,522
Personally, I feel as though the work that's done in-house is a far better product than what's done through subcontracted labor.

153
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:41,184
And for those reasons, I support this paper wholeheartedly and move approval.

154
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:44,106
Councilor DelaRusso.

155
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:53,293
Mr. President, I want to express my gratitude to Commissioner Terrence and the members of the Department of Public Works for their good work in this matter.

156
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:58,498
There have been a number that we've reported over the past several years.

157
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,040
We're glad to see great progress.

158
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,042
The commissioner knows how to get things done.

159
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:05,063
We're grateful.

160
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:06,944
Second approval, Mr. President.

161
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:09,246
Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

162
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,648
Vice President Marks.

163
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:12,409
Thank you, Mr. President.

164
00:11:13,662 --> 00:11:16,783
If I could, maybe Alicia can shed some light on this.

165
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:21,063
It said $50,000 was transferred from the highway materials and supplies.

166
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:26,144
That account, what was the initial appropriation in this year's budget?

167
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:29,025
I don't know the initial appropriation.

168
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:40,287
I know that you guys voted on a, the President, excuse me, $100,000 in free cash to that account, and we needed to move $50,000 of that free cash you appropriated into the salary count since it's in-house and not contracted out.

169
00:11:42,206 --> 00:11:42,406
Okay.

170
00:11:42,646 --> 00:11:50,131
So, so the, the account that you're saying this is zero one, zero count four, four, two, four, two, two highway materials.

171
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:52,212
What, what does that currently use for?

172
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:56,435
What, what, what do we get with highway materials?

173
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:59,717
I think the DPW commission means that.

174
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:10,324
Council that's a useful miscellaneous supplies, uh, particularly for the highway division for day to day operation.

175
00:12:11,283 --> 00:12:13,665
while we're on the subject here of catch basins.

176
00:12:13,685 --> 00:12:19,948
It could be for frames, covers, cement, barrel block, asphalt.

177
00:12:19,968 --> 00:12:22,450
It could be used for a whole host of reasons.

178
00:12:24,031 --> 00:12:24,411
Right.

179
00:12:24,631 --> 00:12:31,275
So by taking it out of that account and putting it into an overtime account, are we depleting that one count?

180
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:35,157
Are we running the red in that count right now?

181
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:36,958
No, no.

182
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:40,220
What happened was when we did the original free cash appropriation

183
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,381
We put $100,000 into this account.

184
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:47,503
We should have actually split it $50,000, $50,000 between personal and ordinary.

185
00:12:48,503 --> 00:12:52,064
All $100,000 of the free cash appropriation is in that one ordinary account.

186
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:56,386
And in order for him to pay in-house employees, it has to be put into a personal account.

187
00:12:58,046 --> 00:13:00,788
So why wasn't it put in the personal account immediately then?

188
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:01,748
That was just overlooked.

189
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:02,748
That's why we're coming back.

190
00:13:03,008 --> 00:13:03,449
That was what?

191
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:04,389
It was overlooked.

192
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:05,649
It was overlooked?

193
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:06,150
Yeah.

194
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,891
They may have thought they were going to contract and said they saw our savings and did it in-house.

195
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:11,082
instead of going out.

196
00:13:11,402 --> 00:13:13,824
If they had contracted, it would have been fine in the account that they had it in.

197
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:17,627
So is it fair to say there's 50,000 left in that account?

198
00:13:19,868 --> 00:13:24,592
There's 50,000 of the salaries in that account that they can't use to pay the guys.

199
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:28,215
Right, so what's currently left after you pull the 50,000 out?

200
00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:30,917
I can get back to you on that and tell you what their balance is.

201
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:32,178
I didn't bring that information with me.

202
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:36,601
Okay, and Commissioner Kerins,

203
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:42,852
Do you have an active working list of what catch basins need to be done in the community?

204
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:47,956
I can give you the complete list, you know, the completed list.

205
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:48,376
All right.

206
00:13:48,557 --> 00:13:52,619
And then, you know, whatever we we've seen out there has been reported to us.

207
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,682
I do have a list that I could provide you, but I already didn't bring it with me.

208
00:13:56,763 --> 00:13:58,184
I'm not interested in the completed list.

209
00:13:58,224 --> 00:14:02,427
I'd like to see a list of catch basins that you have record of that need attention.

210
00:14:02,647 --> 00:14:02,827
Sure.

211
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:03,362
Okay.

212
00:14:03,382 --> 00:14:07,863
No, I can gladly supply that to you, but it's, it's work, you know, again, work in progress.

213
00:14:07,883 --> 00:14:10,844
So whatever I may give you today or tomorrow, okay.

214
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:14,605
May change two days from now, depending on what we come upon and what's reported.

215
00:14:14,825 --> 00:14:14,985
Right.

216
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:18,566
Do you know roughly how many are on that list that need to be attended to?

217
00:14:18,586 --> 00:14:20,427
Uh, I think right now I'd say at least 12.

218
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:22,087
All right.

219
00:14:22,307 --> 00:14:26,248
That, you know, that we have out there that in our opinion have to be rebuilt.

220
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:28,229
Totally rebuilt.

221
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:28,529
Yeah.

222
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:29,949
Completely, completely rebuilt.

223
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:32,490
I mean, just how far down we have to go, you know,

224
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:38,421
We have to actually take off the cover and get down and inspect them, each one on a case by case basis.

225
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:43,343
Some of them are total rebuilds, which means going 10 feet down, working your way up.

226
00:14:43,703 --> 00:14:45,964
Some could be only four for the top four feet.

227
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:47,804
They all vary in condition.

228
00:14:48,445 --> 00:14:48,625
Right.

229
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:48,985
Yeah.

230
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:56,548
If you can provide the council with a list of currently what needs to be done, um, because, because the number sounds awfully low to me.

231
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:02,490
And I realized you just said 12 need to be rebuilt, but in just going around the city, I see a lot of sunken,

232
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:03,527
catch basins.

233
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:06,449
There are a lot of them.

234
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:07,069
Yeah, there are.

235
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:09,010
Like I said, it's work in progress, Councillor.

236
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,210
Right.

237
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,491
OK, that we're doing.

238
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:12,132
But I mean, we've made excellent headway.

239
00:15:12,352 --> 00:15:20,916
Of course, this time of the year with the cold and everything, you know, there are some days it's a weather permitting as far as, you know, actually working on, particularly when you're dealing with asphalt and cement.

240
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:31,582
But, you know, when we take advantage of a good day, you know, we go out there and, you know, the crew can rebuild an average of three a day, again, depending on their condition when they start.

241
00:15:32,897 --> 00:15:38,761
And while we're talking about catch basins, we still currently contract out for the cleaning of the catch basins, correct?

242
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:39,701
That's correct, sir.

243
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:41,843
And where do we stand with that currently?

244
00:15:42,503 --> 00:15:45,365
Right now, OK, we've obviously ceased for the winter.

245
00:15:45,885 --> 00:15:50,988
OK, we'll pick the program back up in April, OK, and continue on with it.

246
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:54,510
But are we a certain percentage through our list?

247
00:15:55,731 --> 00:16:01,315
You said, I'm sure, when the budget comes out in July, we start working on catch basin cleaning, right?

248
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:02,055
That's correct.

249
00:16:02,283 --> 00:16:06,065
So how far do we get into the catch basin cleaning before the winter came?

250
00:16:06,405 --> 00:16:06,585
OK.

251
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:11,547
Right now, I would have to say we're probably about 85% to 90% completed.

252
00:16:11,907 --> 00:16:12,167
OK.

253
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:16,269
It's just now a question of finishing up before the weather turned on us.

254
00:16:17,469 --> 00:16:19,990
And it's all being done by the subcontractor?

255
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,790
That's correct, sir.

256
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,352
And at any given year, do they get through 100% of the catch basins?

257
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:28,033
Or do we just subcontract for a certain percentage of what we have?

258
00:16:28,814 --> 00:16:29,014
No.

259
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:29,854
OK.

260
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:31,995
From what I've gathered past history,

261
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:40,105
They have been able to complete them, portion in the summertime, fall, and then they pick up back in the spring.

262
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:44,849
But they've pretty much stayed on top of cleaning all the basins in the city.

263
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:48,892
So every year we're getting through 100% of the catch basin cleanings?

264
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:51,153
Very close to it, if not 100%.

265
00:16:51,193 --> 00:16:54,816
Again, it's only my first year here.

266
00:16:54,856 --> 00:16:56,337
My target is to get 100% by June 30th.

267
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:09,566
And is the process still that this company will mark each catch basin with a different color when they are completed?

268
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:11,027
Yes, it is.

269
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:12,188
That's correct, Vice President.

270
00:17:12,388 --> 00:17:14,050
So they'll use some type of marking?

271
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:14,610
Yes.

272
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,192
They spray paint it.

273
00:17:17,032 --> 00:17:21,897
Can you provide us with a report on the number of catch basins that have been done this fiscal year?

274
00:17:23,118 --> 00:17:25,240
OK, I can provide you the list of streets.

275
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:26,205
Okay.

276
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:29,847
Each street varies as far as the number of bases on each street.

277
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:35,810
I don't need to know the exact number, but if you could tell us how many streets altogether and how many have been completed, that'd be great to date.

278
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,170
Certainly.

279
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:36,771
Thank you.

280
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:37,031
Okay.

281
00:17:38,512 --> 00:17:39,372
Councilor DelaRusso.

282
00:17:40,213 --> 00:17:47,536
I just want to express my gratitude to Alicia Nunley for her explanation and transparency of these accounts.

283
00:17:48,437 --> 00:17:48,717
Thank you.

284
00:17:48,737 --> 00:17:49,658
Councilor DelaRusso.

285
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:54,100
On the motion by Councilor Nyeth, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

286
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:56,046
All those in favor?

287
00:17:56,506 --> 00:17:56,666
Aye.

288
00:17:57,907 --> 00:17:59,428
Roll call vote is required.

289
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:01,449
Councilor DelaRusso?

290
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:01,830
Yes.

291
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,090
Councilor Felco?

292
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:03,291
Yes.

293
00:18:03,711 --> 00:18:04,251
Councilor Knight?

294
00:18:04,331 --> 00:18:05,032
Yes.

295
00:18:05,072 --> 00:18:05,792
Councilor Locker?

296
00:18:05,812 --> 00:18:06,052
Yes.

297
00:18:06,393 --> 00:18:07,173
Vice President Marks?

298
00:18:07,313 --> 00:18:07,573
Yes.

299
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:08,894
Councilor Scott Kelly?

300
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:09,375
Yes.

301
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:10,375
President Caviello?

302
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:11,596
Yes.

303
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:14,678
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

304
00:18:14,698 --> 00:18:16,299
The money is in.

305
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,541
We have one more.

306
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:21,203
One more, 17-067.

307
00:18:21,923 --> 00:18:24,265
To the Honorable President, members of the Memphis City Council,

308
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:25,505

The balance in certified cash prior to this vote is $9 million,

324
00:20:23,892 --> 00:20:34,599
$709,329.

325

With the exception of the police items, the remaining were presented in the draft capital budget presented in the fall.

326

Chief of police Leo Sacco, deputy fire chief and DPW commissioner Brian Kearns will be present to answer any questions we may have.

327
00:20:47,008 --> 00:20:47,868
Counselor Falco.

328
00:20:48,229 --> 00:20:49,510
Thank you, Mr. President.

329
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:49,930
Um,

330
00:20:50,643 --> 00:20:51,944
I just have a question in general.

331
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:55,605
Um, you know, of course safety and the wellbeing of personnel is always a top priority.

332
00:20:56,105 --> 00:21:08,771
So with regard to, um, the turndown gear, um, so if this gets approved, when can we actually see, you know, the, the turndown gear, the, the police cars, the, uh, uh, the new trucks.

333
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:13,273
I mean, when, when, when will, when we, when will, when will we actually see this?

334
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:18,775
Um, I would think the mayor was looking to do this, uh, as soon as possible.

335
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:26,173
So if we approve this tonight, is the turn down gear gonna be, you know, I'm sorry, turn out gear, I apologize.

336
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,674
Yeah, so as soon as possible, I'll be down.

337
00:21:29,694 --> 00:21:31,295
Point of information, Councilor Scott Pelli.

338
00:21:31,315 --> 00:21:33,916
Can we ask the Deputy Chief, were they already ordered?

339
00:21:34,596 --> 00:21:41,219
Would they know, who would know if the turn out gear, because I thought they were already ordered, because I think that took some time.

340
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,581
Name and address of the record, please.

341
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:46,661
Point of order, Councilor Knight.

342
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:47,542
Would it make sense for,

343
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:53,850
each individual that's representing a respective department to come up and do a brief presentation on the appropriation that's being requested right now.

344
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,814
We have Chief Sacco, we have Deputy Chief here as well.

345
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:01,951
What was the question, council?

346
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:03,652
The question of the turnout gear.

347
00:22:04,052 --> 00:22:05,033
Have they already been ordered?

348
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:05,634
No.

349
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:08,596
In fact, we just got our first couple of bids for this.

350
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:14,901
So once we award it, then it would probably take about a month, probably, to have everybody fitted and then the gear to be made.

351
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:17,223
So I would guess a month.

352
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:17,864
Thank you.

353
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:18,864
I'm sorry, Mr. Falk.

354
00:22:19,565 --> 00:22:19,865
Thank you.

355
00:22:20,446 --> 00:22:20,806
No problem.

356
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:24,309
Chief Sacco, would you like to speak?

357
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:25,850
Good evening.

358
00:22:26,176 --> 00:22:28,438
Leo Sacco, police chief here in the city of Medford.

359
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:31,159
My home address is 227 Elm Street in Medford.

360
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:37,184
Chief, you have the critical response equipment.

361
00:22:37,204 --> 00:22:38,144
Could you tell us what that is?

362
00:22:39,185 --> 00:22:49,912
Okay, that is, I'll explain what the critical incident or critical response team was developed last spring in light of what's going on around the country.

363
00:22:50,353 --> 00:22:53,795
We need to train officers in our department to do a quick deployment

364
00:22:54,652 --> 00:23:02,317
when they're working, if there's a major incident that might happen anywhere, whether it be at a mall, shopping center, school, et cetera.

365
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:07,341
God forbid it happens, but we have to be prepared and be ready to go.

366
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:13,385
So we have 16 members of a team, actually I think it's down to 15 right now, that have been trained and outfitted.

367
00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:16,247
This is a key piece of their equipment.

368
00:23:16,287 --> 00:23:19,950
This is a tactical vest that we need to outfit them with.

369
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,692
And it is a staggering figure,

370
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:39,802
we can't get reimbursement from the state or the federal government for this vest, because we already issued the other vest, the regular body armor, the soft body armor, for the individual officers, and the state and the federal government will only reimburse for one set of body armor.

371
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:41,843
So this is something that's needed.

372
00:23:41,903 --> 00:23:43,003
It's over and above.

373
00:23:43,043 --> 00:23:44,103
It's a tactical vest.

374
00:23:44,744 --> 00:23:45,944
They wear it like a jacket.

375
00:23:46,004 --> 00:23:52,487
It's heavy, takes a lot to hold it up, but it will withstand gunfire.

376
00:23:53,623 --> 00:23:56,806
And the $25,000 for speed monitors, Chief, what kind of?

377
00:23:57,206 --> 00:23:59,868
Members of this council have been asking for this for a long time.

378
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:03,030
We have one that was struck and I think it's beyond repair.

379
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,931
We've had a couple of companies look at it.

380
00:24:04,951 --> 00:24:16,700
This will buy two speed monitors so that we can be more effective out in the community as far as radar and speed enforcement and actually let the community see what the speed limit actually is on the street.

381
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,803
Sometimes if you see a 20 mile per hour or a 30 mile per hour,

382
00:24:22,023 --> 00:24:27,867
You think they're doing 50, and it's actually, the monitor will show what the true speed is, so we look forward to those.

383
00:24:28,487 --> 00:24:33,650
And I think, Chief, this is your biggest one here is 12 cruises, six marked and six unmarked.

384
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,091
We all know you need cars.

385
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:36,352
This is huge.

386
00:24:36,432 --> 00:24:37,453
This is the first time.

387
00:24:37,493 --> 00:24:38,233
Long time coming.

388
00:24:40,514 --> 00:24:42,696
Been Chief now going on 27 years.

389
00:24:42,736 --> 00:24:49,920
This is the first time that I can say that we'd be able to receive 12 brand new vehicles pretty much at one time.

390
00:24:51,246 --> 00:24:52,567
six marked, six unmarked.

391
00:24:53,507 --> 00:25:02,489
I know that sometimes there's a little issue with the idea of unmarked vehicles, but some of our unmarked vehicles are close to 20 years old, very high mileage.

392
00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:12,392
Some of the old painted over Ford Crown Victorias, they look pretty good, but they're high mileage, they're 200,000 miles on them.

393
00:25:13,372 --> 00:25:19,494
So we've run out of vehicles, we're using drug forfeiture cars, which actually are pieces of junk,

394
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:27,615
This is something that we really need, and I'm thankful that the mayor listened to my request and put it forward.

395
00:25:28,055 --> 00:25:45,570
But obviously, this council has been pushing for the marked vehicles right along and getting replacement vehicles, so six will also be a good infusion, and we'll probably be able to auction off the Crown Victorias that are really high mileage, and it really served us well, but they're at the end of their life.

396
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:48,632
What type of vehicles are you planning on buying, Chief?

397
00:25:48,852 --> 00:25:49,653
The Ford Explorer.

398
00:25:50,492 --> 00:25:51,513
What about for the unmarked cars?

399
00:25:51,553 --> 00:25:54,074
The unmarked are probably going to be Ford Fusions.

400
00:25:55,355 --> 00:25:55,895
Thank you, Chief.

401
00:25:55,915 --> 00:26:01,258
I know it's something you've looked for a while, and I would hope you'll support that this evening.

402
00:26:01,818 --> 00:26:02,619
I appreciate that.

403
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:12,824
And just to answer Councilor Falco's question, I've been told by the Chief Procurement Officer that once this was approved, that they would place the order.

404
00:26:13,044 --> 00:26:16,326
I've checked with the company that has the state contract for the vehicles.

405
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:18,418
they would have to order the vehicles.

406
00:26:18,538 --> 00:26:20,940
Some of the vehicles may be in stock, but they would have to order.

407
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:30,566
So it would be dependent on how long it would take for a motor company to get them off the assembly line, but hopefully definitely before the beginning of the summer.

408
00:26:31,606 --> 00:26:32,107
Thank you, chief.

409
00:26:32,707 --> 00:26:34,548
Mr. Cairns, would you like to, uh, thank you.

410
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:40,252
Mr. Cairns make his presentation and we'll ask him everyone at the questions, right?

411
00:26:41,352 --> 00:26:41,612
Yeah.

412
00:26:44,614 --> 00:26:45,675
Mr. Cairns, why don't you,

413
00:26:46,652 --> 00:26:49,434
This equipment's for you, so why don't you explain so this way we'll know this far.

414
00:26:49,454 --> 00:27:00,562
Council President, I'd like to just ask that we please amend the paper on the $40,000 forestry F-250 pickup truck with plow package should actually be UHF radio.

415
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:01,863
I'm sorry, which one is that?

416
00:27:01,884 --> 00:27:02,924
The one.

417
00:27:03,345 --> 00:27:04,005
For the forestry?

418
00:27:04,145 --> 00:27:09,129
Yes, the forestry F-250 for $40,000 should actually be UHF radio system for the DPW.

419
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:09,510
Okay.

420
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,132
Okay.

421
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:12,532
Mr. Gerens.

422
00:27:12,752 --> 00:27:13,613
Yes, Mr. President.

423
00:27:17,294 --> 00:27:31,565
Okay, the Department of Public Works has, you know, put in, you know, requests for, you know, the upgrade of some of the vehicles that, you know, are at the point now where they're really getting beyond repair.

424
00:27:32,946 --> 00:27:43,154
You know, a lot of them, again, high mileage and, you know, now are also suffering from deterioration from, you know, body rot from over the years.

425
00:27:44,055 --> 00:27:47,177
Some of these vehicles are on state contract.

426
00:27:47,963 --> 00:27:52,565
Um, so it would be just a question of a finance department issuing a purchase order.

427
00:27:53,245 --> 00:28:03,289
Uh, as far as the estimated time, uh, you know, we're, we're getting, you know, anywhere from, you know, one to three months, depending on, uh, you know, what the specifications call for.

428
00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:16,975
Uh, as far as what, uh, uh, the auditor was explaining, as far as the radio communication system, the existing two way radio communication system was, uh, from what I gather the history of it.

429
00:28:17,566 --> 00:28:27,613
is the original two-way radio system that the Medford Police Department got back many, many, many, many years ago.

430
00:28:28,293 --> 00:28:29,874
It's beyond repair.

431
00:28:30,655 --> 00:28:31,855
Parts are no longer available.

432
00:28:31,895 --> 00:28:33,396
It's an old low-band system.

433
00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:43,723
And what's happening now is a lot of guys have been using their cell phones because the radios in the trucks no longer work.

434
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,905
The range on them is very, very limited.

435
00:28:47,773 --> 00:29:04,578
Um, and, uh, you know, it just needs a systems upgrade, uh, you know, for, uh, not only for, uh, getting the work done on a day to day basis and to, uh, you know, keep, uh, you know, stretch out the man hours rather than, uh, you know, go back to the yard and get further instructions, but it's also for the safety of the personnel.

436
00:29:04,638 --> 00:29:07,759
I mean, driving, you know, driving all this, the equipment that's out there.

437
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:09,880
Okay.

438
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:12,801
Thank you.

439
00:29:12,861 --> 00:29:13,021
Yep.

440
00:29:15,762 --> 00:29:16,062
All right.

441
00:29:17,802 --> 00:29:18,362
Councilor Falco.

442
00:29:19,303 --> 00:29:19,963
Thank you, Mr. President.

443
00:29:19,983 --> 00:29:21,704
I just had a question for Chief Sacco.

444
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:26,766
Yes.

445
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:27,547
Thank you, Chief.

446
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:33,849
Um, so with regard to the, uh, new, uh, the new cruisers, the marked and unmarked, so we're buying new cruisers, which is great.

447
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,450
We need them.

448
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:39,332
But as far as the, what should be our strategy for purchasing going forward?

449
00:29:39,492 --> 00:29:41,093
Should we be replacing cruisers?

450
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,774
I mean, in your opinion, you've been doing this for a while.

451
00:29:43,994 --> 00:29:45,815
What should the city be doing moving forward?

452
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:48,813
Should we be buying them every year, every few years?

453
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,454
What's the best approach?

454
00:29:50,655 --> 00:30:05,046
The best approach is buying vehicles every year, five to six vehicles every year that would replace your frontline fleet, and then you could have a supervisor's vehicle or a canine vehicle or an unmarked vehicle.

455
00:30:06,087 --> 00:30:12,652
With this happening right now, six and six, this gives us a great foundation, but we can't let a year slide by.

456
00:30:12,672 --> 00:30:13,393
Exactly.

457
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:14,494
You have to stay on top of it.

458
00:30:14,534 --> 00:30:15,755
You won't need 12 every year.

459
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:21,294
But if you could replace, you know, five, four might not be just enough.

460
00:30:21,434 --> 00:30:22,635
Five would be good.

461
00:30:22,755 --> 00:30:23,556
Six would be better.

462
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:24,717
It would be the best.

463
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:28,960
Every year, there should be every year or no more than 18 months.

464
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:30,201
OK, perfect.

465
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:30,562
Thank you.

466
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:33,224
Vice President Max.

467
00:30:34,885 --> 00:30:35,826
Thank you, Mr. President.

468
00:30:36,887 --> 00:30:42,331
Regarding the speed monitors for twenty five thousand, are we getting one or two chief?

469
00:30:42,351 --> 00:30:43,012
How many speed?

470
00:30:43,614 --> 00:30:44,474
The goal is two.

471
00:30:44,615 --> 00:30:48,056
I believe we can purchase 12,500 for each.

472
00:30:49,117 --> 00:30:51,979
And currently, how many speed monitors do we have within the department?

473
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:53,660
We have one that's inoperable.

474
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,762
Right now, it was struck when it was on the road.

475
00:30:58,342 --> 00:30:59,183
So we just have one?

476
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:01,744
We really don't even have that one now.

477
00:31:01,964 --> 00:31:02,725
We need these two.

478
00:31:03,265 --> 00:31:04,045
OK.

479
00:31:04,786 --> 00:31:12,290
And the police cruisers and the EMAC vehicles, are they going to be fully equipped with the latest computers?

480
00:31:13,656 --> 00:31:19,198
The marked vehicles will be fully equipped with all the computers, radios, lighting.

481
00:31:20,199 --> 00:31:22,240
The unmarked vehicles won't have computers.

482
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,002
Every detective has a laptop or a tablet so that they can use.

483
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:29,182
They don't need them in the vehicle itself.

484
00:31:29,663 --> 00:31:34,224
They will have radios in the vehicle and they'll have emergency lighting and a siren.

485
00:31:36,265 --> 00:31:36,545
Okay.

486
00:31:37,226 --> 00:31:42,828
And I know within the budget, Chief, you put in for some additional civilian personnel.

487
00:31:43,948 --> 00:31:47,069
to do some computer work and also some crime statistics.

488
00:31:47,869 --> 00:31:50,510
Is that still something that you could use in the police department?

489
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:50,990
Yes.

490
00:31:52,131 --> 00:31:55,952
Are you going to be making a recommendation for that manpower again or?

491
00:31:56,252 --> 00:31:56,752
Yes, I will.

492
00:31:57,192 --> 00:31:57,432
Okay.

493
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:01,193
Do we expect to see it during the budget time or before budget?

494
00:32:02,194 --> 00:32:03,434
It'll probably be a budget time.

495
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:04,534
Budget time?

496
00:32:04,594 --> 00:32:05,955
Well into the cycle right now.

497
00:32:06,515 --> 00:32:06,755
Okay.

498
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:10,176
So it will be in, I will be submitting it in my next budget request.

499
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:11,416
Thank you.

500
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,337
Council Member Kern.

501
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:15,222
Thank you, President Caraviello.

502
00:32:16,503 --> 00:32:19,345
Chief, along the same lines, great to see two monitors.

503
00:32:19,385 --> 00:32:26,231
I think it's going to — one of the main complaints we get is speeding, and I think it's going to help curb the speeding issues we have.

504
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:34,098
With regards to that, I know we had spoke, and you were before us maybe a few months ago, with regards to — and we were asking questions with regards to the radar guns.

505
00:32:34,598 --> 00:32:38,161
Was that also on your wish list, and it just didn't make the cut tonight, or —

506
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:45,639
No, we're actually purchasing some new radar equipment out of our existing budget, out of the public safety account in our budget.

507
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,583
And how many, um, what are you purchasing?

508
00:32:50,603 --> 00:32:54,026
I believe it'll be for handheld radar units.

509
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:55,447
Oh, great.

510
00:32:57,489 --> 00:32:58,670
What account will that be coming out of?

511
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,952
I believe it's public safety.

512
00:33:05,432 --> 00:33:08,433
But it will be coming out of the budget that we set in June.

513
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,454
The existing budget that we're operating with.

514
00:33:12,934 --> 00:33:13,114
Great.

515
00:33:13,635 --> 00:33:17,536
And it's good just to see new cruisers and invest along with the other.

516
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:31,840
I know there's, I guess probably another time we can talk about the items that didn't make this list today, because I know each department is in need of, whether it be vehicles in the DPW or radar guns, different things.

517
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,821
We're always hearing about the needs of

518
00:33:34,623 --> 00:33:42,847
these three departments, so it's nice to see the list here tonight and nice to move forward on things we've been requesting for quite some time.

519
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:44,308
Thank you for being here.

520
00:33:44,328 --> 00:33:45,009
Thank you.

521
00:33:46,449 --> 00:33:47,310
Councilor DelaRusso.

522
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,931
Mr. President, there are no surprises on this list.

523
00:33:50,011 --> 00:33:58,456
It's stuff we've either asked for, lobbied for, heard department heads ask for, we've suggested, we've begged for, we've demanded.

524
00:33:58,476 --> 00:33:59,516
Move approval.

525
00:33:59,936 --> 00:34:00,256
Second.

526
00:34:00,277 --> 00:34:01,777
You are 100% correct, Councilor DelaRusso.

527
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:02,998
Councilor Knight.

528
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,201
Mr. President, thank you very much.

529
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:07,583
And I certainly echo Counselor De La Russo's sentiments.

530
00:34:08,204 --> 00:34:09,625
I feel as though this is a good paper.

531
00:34:09,645 --> 00:34:12,327
It reflects a lot of the desires and wishes of this council.

532
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:27,498
In reviewing the appropriation, we're getting equipment to keep our police officers and firefighters safe, new vehicles for our police and our DPWs so that they can have the tools to do the job, and equipment to address efficiency of the administration and government, Mr. President.

533
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:29,420
So I feel as though this is a good paper.

534
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,141
I feel as though they're worthwhile expenditures.

535
00:34:31,712 --> 00:34:34,473
And for that reason, I will be supporting this measure and move approval.

536
00:34:36,014 --> 00:34:36,794
Council Member Kern.

537
00:34:36,954 --> 00:34:37,195
Thank you.

538
00:34:37,235 --> 00:34:37,595
I'm not sure.

539
00:34:37,615 --> 00:34:39,936
I didn't know if we were taking one department at a time.

540
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:45,638
If I could just ask a couple of questions with regards to the fire department computer system upgrade.

541
00:34:45,658 --> 00:34:50,080
I don't know if that's deputy chief kind of.

542
00:34:51,661 --> 00:34:56,683
So, um, chief is on vacation, so I'm not intimately involved with these day to day purchases.

543
00:34:56,723 --> 00:34:58,564
So I, but I know he did tell me that we need it.

544
00:34:58,584 --> 00:34:59,805
He's wanted this for awhile.

545
00:35:00,085 --> 00:35:00,525
And, um,

546
00:35:01,278 --> 00:35:13,643
He said that this will involve more storage, better emails into department communications, and also a maintenance agreement to keep our equipment up to date.

547
00:35:14,663 --> 00:35:16,644
So that's basically what I know about that computer purchase.

548
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:28,128
If we could just make a B paper that we get an update with regards to all of these items and what stage we're at, maybe on a bimonthly basis, so that we know in six months the emails

549
00:35:28,748 --> 00:35:31,709
We'll be up and running, and the flight department will have their new computer system.

550
00:35:31,789 --> 00:35:34,449
And in four months, all the cruises are coming in.

551
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:39,710
People from these departments do call each counselor and ask questions.

552
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:48,591
So it would be nice to have a running update with regards to when this is being done, which RFPs are going out when, and when we're going to see all these come to fruition.

553
00:35:50,972 --> 00:35:51,352
Thank you.

554
00:35:51,372 --> 00:35:52,012
Mr. McNerney.

555
00:35:53,232 --> 00:35:54,152
Thank you, Mr. President.

556
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:57,813
And my question is regarding DPW.

557
00:35:58,941 --> 00:36:05,642
And I see that there are a lot of new pieces of equipment that we're moving forward with.

558
00:36:06,402 --> 00:36:10,823
And I don't think anybody behind this reel would say that there isn't a need.

559
00:36:11,563 --> 00:36:19,425
However, I do question, Mr. President, in the future would be helpful when we do put a request out for such a dollar amount.

560
00:36:20,005 --> 00:36:24,966
And by the way, just recently, the linkage committee, which you happen to sit on, Mr. President,

561
00:36:25,691 --> 00:36:36,336
just expended $435,000 on new equipment for DPW also in addition to what's being spent here tonight.

562
00:36:36,816 --> 00:36:49,442
So I think it would be helpful as one member of the council, if we're going to put on a number of items and say, well, we're going to purchase a F-250 pickup truck, I think it would be helpful to know how many we currently have.

563
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:54,071
Is this replacing a pickup truck, or is this adding to the fleet of pickup trucks?

564
00:36:54,711 --> 00:37:00,413
That way, at least we can make an informed decision when these things do come before us, Mr. President.

565
00:37:00,753 --> 00:37:10,617
Because honestly, I have no idea whether we need a 10-wheel dump truck, or whether we need a 550 four-wheel drive dump truck, or a cemetery backhoe.

566
00:37:10,993 --> 00:37:15,274
And it would be helpful to get a little bit of narrative other than just the line item itself.

567
00:37:17,094 --> 00:37:28,956
But if you can maybe go through them just rather quickly, Commissioner Kerins, just to let us know the particular piece of equipment, if it's replacing a piece of equipment, or if it's just adding to the existing fleet.

568
00:37:29,716 --> 00:37:30,016
OK.

569
00:37:30,797 --> 00:37:33,677
Mr. Vice President, I can put it all in a nutshell.

570
00:37:33,777 --> 00:37:35,077
Everything is a one for one.

571
00:37:36,418 --> 00:37:38,718
Now, case in point, there may be

572
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:47,249
You know, a pickup truck out there today, we have all good intentions of churning in for one that's on this particular request sheet.

573
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:52,612
Tomorrow, it could be another one, you know, due to a motor vehicle accident or, you know, something else.

574
00:37:52,632 --> 00:37:57,714
But there's no increase in the fleet as far as what I call the rolling stock.

575
00:37:58,134 --> 00:38:00,836
Backhoe for backhoe, pickup for pickup.

576
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:04,978
It's when you might get into the specialized equipment.

577
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:15,081
all right, that, you know, we may not, you know, have that particular kind of equipment, but everything that you have listed, you know, for my request is a one for one.

578
00:38:15,741 --> 00:38:15,941
Okay.

579
00:38:16,401 --> 00:38:17,162
That's very helpful.

580
00:38:17,202 --> 00:38:22,544
And maybe a narrative like that in the future would be very helpful for certainly at least myself.

581
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:35,089
Um, and just the last point I have, Mr. President, uh, there was a narrative at the end that said, with exception of the police items, the remaining presented in the, uh, the remaining were presented in the draft capital budget

582
00:38:35,453 --> 00:38:36,394
presented in the fall.

583
00:38:36,974 --> 00:38:42,757
I assume the mayor is letting us know that this was part of the draft plan that was presented, the capital plan.

584
00:38:43,618 --> 00:38:46,259
And I would only ask, when are we going to get the full plan?

585
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,163
I don't think we should be working on a draft plan still this far into the fiscal year.

586
00:38:52,763 --> 00:39:00,848
And if there are any plans for a full capital plan out there, Mr. President, I think it's important that we find that out now, rather than working on a draft plan.

587
00:39:01,663 --> 00:39:03,865
So I would ask that that be part of the committee.

588
00:39:03,905 --> 00:39:05,125
I will bring that to the mayor's attention.

589
00:39:05,746 --> 00:39:18,534
But I would also ask that it be part of the committee paper, Mr. President, that we get a response back from the administration regarding when a full capital budget plan will come out and why are we still working off a draft budget plan?

590
00:39:19,175 --> 00:39:19,515
Thank you.

591
00:39:20,256 --> 00:39:21,036
Councilor Falco.

592
00:39:21,336 --> 00:39:22,017
Thank you, Mr. President.

593
00:39:22,037 --> 00:39:24,698
I actually have one more question for Commissioner Kearns.

594
00:39:28,881 --> 00:39:29,202
Thank you.

595
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:29,842
Yes, Councilor.

596
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:41,778
So last year, I had a resolution to buy a sidewalk plow, to look into buying a sidewalk plow, because we're trying to push a lot of pedestrian initiatives.

597
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:43,699
We have Walk Medford.

598
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,281
We have a Complete Streets program now.

599
00:39:46,341 --> 00:39:54,047
So we're really trying to encourage people to get out, walk, be pedestrians, and use public transportation and whatnot.

600
00:39:54,107 --> 00:39:57,549
So I don't see anything here for a sidewalk plow.

601
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,631
It didn't make the cut, and I understand that.

602
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:07,337
Do we have any type of machinery right now that we could use to plow sidewalks in our community, especially city-owned sidewalks?

603
00:40:08,077 --> 00:40:13,478
It really would depend on the location and the width of the sidewalk.

604
00:40:14,098 --> 00:40:19,340
There are some sidewalks we can get one of our pickup trucks down and plow.

605
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,881
Other sidewalks, we'd have to use bobcats or snowblowers or a combination of both.

606
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:39,910
I mean, I'm thinking like if I think of a bombardier or something like that, a trackless plow.

607
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:46,536
Those type of plows, when I looked into it, I mean, it could zip right down a sidewalk, especially in your business communities.

608
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:57,384
With regard to schools, I remember when I was on the school committee, we'd get calls all the time where kids walking to school would be forced out onto the street, like if you walked by Gillis Park down Fulton Street, you're walking to the Roberts.

609
00:40:57,424 --> 00:41:03,208
You're forced out onto the street because it's a city-owned sidewalk, but there's no machinery that we really have to plow something like that.

610
00:41:04,368 --> 00:41:06,049
I think it's something that should be considered.

611
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:08,230
I wish I was on here tonight.

612
00:41:08,611 --> 00:41:11,432
I'm happy with what's here, believe me, and I will vote for this.

613
00:41:11,592 --> 00:41:15,935
I'm 100% in favor of it, but I think it's something that we need to consider in the future.

614
00:41:16,653 --> 00:41:33,938
in, in, you know, when we have, uh, you know, counselor, uh, between, uh, you know, uh, the administrative office of public works and, uh, the, you know, the park foreman, Mr Nesta, we've done extensive research as far as, uh, what types of equipment are out there, uh, that would be suitable for our sidewalks.

615
00:41:33,998 --> 00:41:39,240
Again, you know, we have to keep in consideration, you know, we have hydrants and poles and everything else.

616
00:41:39,613 --> 00:41:43,896
So you get something too big, but at the same time something too small.

617
00:41:45,077 --> 00:41:55,804
But it's really a case of trying to get something that would have the potential of being multi-seasonal to get, we'll say, like a bombardier.

618
00:41:57,085 --> 00:42:00,087
They're built for one purpose and one purpose only, to plow snow.

619
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:02,148
They're extremely expensive.

620
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:11,595
You're talking in and around $90,000, okay, for something that, yes, okay, you definitely would need if the snow was flying.

621
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:16,756
But, you know, so we've been looking at the various options that are out there.

622
00:42:17,096 --> 00:42:30,400
So even if it's a question, okay, of getting, you know, like a trackless vehicle to plow the snow, but in the summertime, okay, could be utilized for the maintenance and the upkeep of the baseball fields or football fields.

623
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,281
So, you know, we've been exploring, okay,

624
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:35,284
what would be the biggest bang for the buck.

625
00:42:36,365 --> 00:42:42,867
And then we will approach the mayor, you know, with the formal request and the reasons why we would need it.

626
00:42:43,508 --> 00:42:47,069
But something that, you know, 12 months of the year availability.

627
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,910
No, I agree with you 100%.

628
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:56,333
I mean, I know when I researched the trackless plow and it could be used to, I think it was one that could be used to grind stumps.

629
00:42:57,094 --> 00:42:59,775
It could be used, so there was, there were uses for, you know,

630
00:43:00,555 --> 00:43:03,476
summer you could use it for hauling debris and whatnot.

631
00:43:03,516 --> 00:43:07,257
So, um, but I'm hoping in the future that we'll see something like that.

632
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:08,398
Absolutely.

633
00:43:08,558 --> 00:43:09,038
Thank you.

634
00:43:10,499 --> 00:43:10,799
Thank you.

635
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:11,619
Counselor Falco.

636
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:18,681
And the only thing we didn't talk about was the, um, the scanner copier that Cassandra has been asking for for many years.

637
00:43:18,761 --> 00:43:22,123
And, uh, she's not here to, um, defend that.

638
00:43:22,143 --> 00:43:28,625
But again, uh, at the last two budget seasons, that is something that she's looked for and that will be in there also.

639
00:43:29,604 --> 00:43:30,444
Councilor DelaRusso.

640
00:43:30,644 --> 00:43:31,345
Move for question.

641
00:43:32,165 --> 00:43:36,307
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Knight.

642
00:43:38,928 --> 00:43:39,969
Name and address for the record, please.

643
00:43:39,989 --> 00:43:44,411
My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of the Saugus party.

644
00:43:45,471 --> 00:43:51,674
I don't have any problems with the requests that are being made, but my problem is in the process that's being presented here to you this evening.

645
00:43:52,554 --> 00:43:58,577
Um, what seems to be unfamiliar is the fact that this president administration talked about this issue

646
00:43:59,088 --> 00:44:01,650
of inclusion and being a part of what's taking place.

647
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:07,434
You have the police, the forestry, the engineering department, the cemetery, the highway, and the fire department.

648
00:44:08,235 --> 00:44:14,999
Six departments that you folks during budgetary time have heard all of these concerns that are being presented here tonight.

649
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,423
And as a matter of fact, it goes back to the times when I served in this body where some of these issues were there.

650
00:44:20,903 --> 00:44:22,525
This money is coming out of free cash.

651
00:44:23,085 --> 00:44:25,867
And because it's coming out of free cash, which was asked for before,

652
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:34,445
You folks were told, or we were told, as well as you folks were told, at some point in time, we can't use it because it might have an effect upon the bond rating here in the city of Medford.

653
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:40,128
Now, all of a sudden, it's coming out as a $1,100,000 transfer of money.

654
00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:47,073
And tomorrow night, Madam Mayor is going to be making her presentation for the State of the City's address.

655
00:44:47,973 --> 00:44:55,918
My concern would be, if there are more things that are going to be coming that's going to have a cost impact upon not only free cash or maybe even bonding,

656
00:44:56,524 --> 00:45:13,350
I think before this vote takes place, I think it probably should be laid on the table for one week, as Councilor Lungo-Kern rightly did some weeks ago on the request of the $900,000 to have some transfer of money from the Water and Sewer account to pay for the remediation of the West Method parking lot.

657
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:26,414
Now, you folks have your own rules, and it's rule number 20, section number 4, which states that any finance paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week

658
00:45:26,916 --> 00:45:29,118
when such action is requested by any counselor.

659
00:45:30,058 --> 00:45:32,340
I would think it would be wise by this city council.

660
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,642
I'm not saying for you to not vote for it or vote for it.

661
00:45:34,702 --> 00:45:41,366
I think it would be wise to lay it on the table for a week and just see what's going to be presented tomorrow night in the state of the city's address.

662
00:45:42,007 --> 00:45:44,929
You folks unfortunately have been kept in the loop, not in the loop.

663
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:49,012
Everything that's being presented here has nothing to do with you folks.

664
00:45:49,472 --> 00:45:53,355
You folks have never met with all the department heads to go through their wishlist.

665
00:45:53,933 --> 00:45:58,034
That was something that was discussed during this past election, and it still hasn't taken place.

666
00:45:58,854 --> 00:46:03,895
A magnificence of $1 million here tonight, and the mayor's representative is not here.

667
00:46:04,856 --> 00:46:05,876
That doesn't speak well.

668
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:08,076
One information, Councilor Knight.

669
00:46:08,096 --> 00:46:10,037
I believe the mayor has four representatives here this evening.

670
00:46:10,997 --> 00:46:11,677
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

671
00:46:11,697 --> 00:46:14,278
The mayor's liaison to the city council is not here tonight.

672
00:46:14,598 --> 00:46:17,759
Department heads might be here, but they're not the ones that bring the message back.

673
00:46:18,299 --> 00:46:23,100
You know, when you go back and you look at some of these things, and you say to yourself, the chief of police just thought through saying,

674
00:46:23,507 --> 00:46:28,997
Six cruises, six regular cars and six cars that are going to be unmarked.

675
00:46:29,618 --> 00:46:34,948
I think this council in the past has asked for each and every year, chief, you can correct me, for a minimum of two new cars.

676
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,441
each and every year in the budget.

677
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:42,067
This should have been, you folks should have been dealing with this within the past year, if not more, and you're not.

678
00:46:42,528 --> 00:46:42,828
Why?

679
00:46:43,148 --> 00:46:46,772
My opinion, and it's election year, and you're getting all this confronted in front of you.

680
00:46:47,093 --> 00:46:50,256
You're gonna be getting sidewalks, you're gonna be getting streets, all done.

681
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:53,500
But where was this money not being used during this past year?

682
00:46:54,618 --> 00:46:56,820
during a year which people had to suffer to go through this.

683
00:46:57,761 --> 00:47:03,906
Why should the fire department have to wait on their turnaround year that they were promised not only last year but the year before?

684
00:47:04,247 --> 00:47:10,552
And now all of a sudden it's found in a free cash supplement when it could have been at the same time taken out of free cash.

685
00:47:10,713 --> 00:47:13,975
It could have been taken out as of January 1st with the new administration.

686
00:47:14,856 --> 00:47:16,818
The politics behind this is quite obvious.

687
00:47:17,399 --> 00:47:20,081
But even more to the politics of it is tomorrow night.

688
00:47:20,795 --> 00:47:24,718
My suggestion would be to wait till tomorrow night, see what this address is all about.

689
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:34,405
And if the address has inclusions of other transfers of money or monies that have to go out for the purposes of being bonded, I think you really need to have a discussion.

690
00:47:34,445 --> 00:47:38,088
And you, Mr. President, you know, amongst this council, there's $210,000 a year paid in salaries.

691
00:47:40,988 --> 00:47:44,850
The executive office, the mayor only gets paid $140,000 a year.

692
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:51,133
So there's more power strength here by what you are getting paid than what that corner office is getting.

693
00:47:51,513 --> 00:47:52,653
And you should put that to use.

694
00:47:53,234 --> 00:48:03,599
And if four of you get together and saying, hey, before we start expending these monies, just right off the hat, Councilman Marks, you've asked for two years in a row for a truck division within the police department.

695
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,701
Nowhere is that found here, and nowhere is it found in the capital improvement plan.

696
00:48:08,881 --> 00:48:13,585
Think about it, in today's day and age, you're talking about email now being in the fire department.

697
00:48:14,485 --> 00:48:34,601
I don't even know if they have email in the police department, but if the fire department is now getting email, and they're supposed to be technologically up to snuff here, we should have the gentleman who runs your computer system down here, and he should be questioned as to what are the problems, and what is the technology needed within this city of Medford, whether it be the fire department, school department, or the city.

698
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:36,926
You haven't had that conversation.

699
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:39,667
There's a wishlist that goes out every single year.

700
00:48:39,908 --> 00:48:41,348
The wishlist is never even addressed.

701
00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:47,952
You just got through, Mr. President, talking about the scanners or the OCD, I mean, excuse me, the engineering office asked for.

702
00:48:48,232 --> 00:48:52,895
It's a simple little request that could have come right out of free cash last year, two years ago.

703
00:48:53,295 --> 00:49:01,140
As a matter of fact, when the lady was there and she made her presentation before the council, she showed you emails that were sent, emails that were sent.

704
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:03,691
that the administration wouldn't do it.

705
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:08,833
So what's being obvious is the fact that you're being asked to do something tonight.

706
00:49:09,194 --> 00:49:15,977
To me, it looks like you're being squirreled into a corner that if you don't vote for it, you're bad and you're not doing what you've all been asking for.

707
00:49:16,097 --> 00:49:17,338
That's not what I'm saying.

708
00:49:17,378 --> 00:49:20,339
What I'm saying is you have one more night to wait and see.

709
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:24,341
I don't see this as being such an emergency that it needs to be voted on tonight.

710
00:49:24,682 --> 00:49:26,923
Your own council rule says the same thing.

711
00:49:27,463 --> 00:49:31,827
Lay it on the table for one week, and if it comes out to be the same when you want to vote for it, go right ahead.

712
00:49:32,528 --> 00:49:50,684
But tomorrow night, if the State of the Union address is going to have something that has another financial impact within this community, whether it's coming off of your free cash or a bond or whatever it might be, don't you think you owe it to yourselves as legislative representatives and to the people of this community to wait and see?

713
00:49:51,765 --> 00:49:53,007
You've waited all this time

714
00:49:54,202 --> 00:49:56,843
Pieces have been taken out of a capital improvement program.

715
00:49:57,664 --> 00:50:02,546
All of a sudden, things that you've been asking for just coincidentally happens to be in your agenda tonight.

716
00:50:03,466 --> 00:50:04,447
Well, I don't think that's right.

717
00:50:04,807 --> 00:50:11,370
And I think all seven of you should have been brought in to fold, whether you agree with the mayor or you don't agree with the mayor, whether she agrees with you or not.

718
00:50:12,171 --> 00:50:14,933
This is an important issue, many important issues here.

719
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:17,295
This isn't $10,000 or $15,000.

720
00:50:17,715 --> 00:50:18,736
This is a million dollars.

721
00:50:19,036 --> 00:50:23,899
And the remaining balance of $8,600,000 is still there to be played with.

722
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,621
And you have no idea what she's going to do with that.

723
00:50:27,322 --> 00:50:28,342
That's up to you folks.

724
00:50:28,763 --> 00:50:41,552
And if you folks can't put the mayor together and force that lady to sit down and talk with you, to turn around and say, hey, you may be picking out things that you need, but that's not what this council sees and hears from Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer in the city of Medford.

725
00:50:42,228 --> 00:50:45,429
I just respectfully state to you, follow your own council rules.

726
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:55,072
Hopefully one of you will lay it on the table for one week, see what comes out tomorrow night, and recognize the fact that whatever your issues might be, they're addressed before this.

727
00:50:55,272 --> 00:50:57,052
You know, you have a capital improvement program here.

728
00:50:57,452 --> 00:51:04,534
There's a lot of things in this capital improvement program that also relates back to the fire department, the police department, some of them are in the school department, and what have you.

729
00:51:04,554 --> 00:51:06,175
It would be nice to know.

730
00:51:07,153 --> 00:51:13,998
Whether a new police department is going to end the offering for tomorrow night, there's $2 million in there to figure out where they're going to put it, draw it, and all of that.

731
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:17,400
If you have sat down and talked with her or her people, no.

732
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:18,841
And I think you should.

733
00:51:19,521 --> 00:51:25,945
It's the most pressing issue, the biggest, most pressing issue here financially for the city of Medford, and no discussion on it.

734
00:51:26,406 --> 00:51:29,928
But you're getting over $1 million worth of transfers being asked for tonight.

735
00:51:30,548 --> 00:51:33,370
Again, I repeat, I am not against any of these transfers.

736
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,932
What I'm against is the process, how it's being presented,

737
00:51:36,279 --> 00:51:42,905
and the opportunity you have to make sure that before you vote for this, you see the complete and total picture, which I believe will be presented tomorrow evening.

738
00:51:43,605 --> 00:51:43,946
Thank you.

739
00:51:44,046 --> 00:51:44,346
Thank you.

740
00:51:44,406 --> 00:51:47,949
During budget time, everyone did ask every department for their wish list.

741
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:49,891
Name and address of the record, please.

742
00:51:49,911 --> 00:51:50,891
Good evening, Mr. President.

743
00:51:51,212 --> 00:51:54,635
My name is Paul Camuso of 114 Lincoln Road in Medford.

744
00:51:54,675 --> 00:51:56,676
And it sort of seems like deja vu.

745
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:58,198
Yes, it does.

746
00:51:58,818 --> 00:52:01,200
But, Mr. President, I just wanted to come down this evening.

747
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:04,323
You know, the men and women of the police department, the fire department,

748
00:52:04,761 --> 00:52:09,604
This is public safety equipment that's before this honorable body this evening.

749
00:52:09,985 --> 00:52:15,568
You know, the Boston Marathon bombing, we didn't know it was going to happen that beautiful day in April.

750
00:52:16,749 --> 00:52:26,816
The fire where there was about five people that passed away down in South Medford, 25 yards from the firehouse, we didn't know that was going to happen that day.

751
00:52:28,898 --> 00:52:32,000
By laying this on the table one more week or two more weeks,

752
00:52:32,577 --> 00:52:36,578
I really believe it's an injustice to the men and women that protect our community.

753
00:52:37,858 --> 00:52:43,139
You know, week after week we're talking about things down here that are needed in this community to better the quality of life.

754
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:48,381
And this is a no-brainer as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President.

755
00:52:49,101 --> 00:52:54,582
You know, the former councillor just referred to the salaries that city councillors are paid.

756
00:52:55,202 --> 00:52:58,223
You guys do a tremendous job for the money that you make.

757
00:52:59,979 --> 00:53:01,041
The collections this year.

758
00:53:01,441 --> 00:53:03,904
I know you guys are working hard with collections to bring in money.

759
00:53:04,726 --> 00:53:05,847
There's a lot of money out there.

760
00:53:06,148 --> 00:53:08,591
There's over $9 million in certified free cash.

761
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:10,293
This community is stable.

762
00:53:10,594 --> 00:53:12,897
This community is thriving, Mr. President.

763
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,741
And I think it's about time that you take a hard vote.

764
00:53:17,201 --> 00:53:19,441
You spend the money to buy those 12 new cruisers.

765
00:53:20,101 --> 00:53:20,922
You spend the money.

766
00:53:21,022 --> 00:53:26,663
Give the fire department the gear that they need to protect themselves, property, and community standards.

767
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:32,424
The NFPA, the NFPA says you need a second set of turnout gear.

768
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:37,425
We only have about three or four people in the department right now that may have second and third turnout gear.

769
00:53:38,606 --> 00:53:40,086
And some of those are outdated, correct, Chief?

770
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:41,695
That's correct.

771
00:53:42,215 --> 00:53:50,823
So to wait any longer, to wait any longer, to let anybody get in the way of taking the vote for the men and women of the Medford Police Department, the Medford Fire Department, and the DPW.

772
00:53:51,183 --> 00:54:00,272
And I sort of single out the Medford Police and Fire Department this evening a little bit more than the other departments, because it is life or death when it comes to them, you know?

773
00:54:02,408 --> 00:54:12,996
And I often, I remember when I was sitting here as an honorable member of this council, and somebody questioned Medford's use of money to get the proper equipment for the police department.

774
00:54:14,016 --> 00:54:29,448
And it was shortly thereafter that down in Watertown, in Watertown on that cold April night when they had shootouts and the bombings that were getting thrown at police officers, and very easily that could have came north on Route 93.

775
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:36,606
And Chief Gilbert, he could have got the phone call at his house at 1.30 in the morning, and we could have had it going on here.

776
00:54:37,647 --> 00:54:42,832
You know, to wait is an injustice to the men and women, and also to the taxpayers.

777
00:54:43,652 --> 00:54:46,375
And on top of that, the DPW does need the equipment.

778
00:54:47,773 --> 00:54:48,593
Go up the cemetery.

779
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:50,034
We have a thriving cemetery.

780
00:54:50,394 --> 00:54:56,796
They're actually doing well up there because people want to stay in our cemetery, in our community, Mr. President.

781
00:54:57,356 --> 00:55:01,518
I know Councillor Marks has been fought for quite some time now for a mausoleum.

782
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:05,239
I know that that's been on the plate up there, Councillor.

783
00:55:06,619 --> 00:55:09,320
So there's just a lot of good stuff going on in this community, Mr. President.

784
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,281
And I think if you wait one week, I think it's

785
00:55:11,992 --> 00:55:14,073
It's definitely not in the best interests of the men and women.

786
00:55:14,234 --> 00:55:15,875
And here's the other thing, too.

787
00:55:16,555 --> 00:55:24,600
We heard the young lady over here and the commissioner talking about, this isn't a fly-by-night thing like some people would want you to think.

788
00:55:26,242 --> 00:55:28,443
There has been price quotations that have been sent out.

789
00:55:29,364 --> 00:55:34,507
They're coming now with a responsible package with the dollar amount that's going to be needed for this.

790
00:55:34,807 --> 00:55:41,832
And furthermore, I find it kind of ironic because this city council as a whole, including myself over the years, have always said,

791
00:55:42,252 --> 00:55:44,994
Let's do it with certified free cash and not bonding.

792
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:51,040
Because the former mayor was a big fan of bonding and, and, and, um, and financing equipment.

793
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,722
And he was very, very good at his job, uh, doing that.

794
00:55:54,123 --> 00:56:08,215
But, uh, here we are this evening and, uh, we're looking at spending certified free cash, which I can go back and watch millions of council tapes over the past 30 plus years that the council always preferred, the preferred method.

795
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:10,252
as far as the council was doing that.

796
00:56:10,732 --> 00:56:19,397
So, uh, I just want to say, uh, I respectfully ask all of the members of the council to support this unanimously and get behind the men and women of the police department and the fire department.

797
00:56:19,857 --> 00:56:22,579
You know, uh, these are the simple things that they need to do their jobs.

798
00:56:23,139 --> 00:56:27,381
And, uh, it's great being down here this evening and thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this body.

799
00:56:27,541 --> 00:56:31,463
And there's nothing on this list that's not deserved or needed by the department.

800
00:56:32,204 --> 00:56:32,764
Counselor Knight.

801
00:56:33,064 --> 00:56:38,047
So the main question that we put Mr. President on the motion by counselor night, counselor Della Russo.

802
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:40,431
President, I made the motion for approval.

803
00:56:40,491 --> 00:56:41,631
I stand by my motion.

804
00:56:41,671 --> 00:56:44,433
I won't be manipulated by political agendas.

805
00:56:44,673 --> 00:56:45,013
Thank you.

806
00:56:45,994 --> 00:56:46,834
Vice President Marks.

807
00:56:47,734 --> 00:56:48,715
Thank you, Mr. President.

808
00:56:49,815 --> 00:56:52,957
I just want to correct the record for a minute here, Mr. President.

809
00:56:53,597 --> 00:57:02,661
It was in June of 2016, we as a council started meeting with department heads prior to the budget.

810
00:57:03,482 --> 00:57:06,043
And we sat down and department heads came before us.

811
00:57:06,573 --> 00:57:09,955
with wish list what they wanted to see in the budget.

812
00:57:10,916 --> 00:57:21,742
And if I'm not mistaken, every council behind this reeling brought up these same exact concerns that we're seeing here tonight eight months ago.

813
00:57:23,383 --> 00:57:30,307
But now we're hearing tonight it would be an injustice if we waited another week to move this forward.

814
00:57:31,441 --> 00:57:34,623
But these issues were brought forward eight months ago.

815
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,025
So was that an injustice for the past eight months?

816
00:57:38,685 --> 00:57:40,426
Why these issues weren't moved forward?

817
00:57:40,886 --> 00:57:42,007
I don't know, Mr. President.

818
00:57:42,807 --> 00:57:51,272
But this body, Mr. President, has stated time and time again, and I have stated time and time again, I refuse to do business piecemeal.

819
00:57:51,632 --> 00:57:53,933
And we've been saying that year after year after year.

820
00:57:54,413 --> 00:57:57,615
It doesn't make sense from a financial standpoint,

821
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:02,896
or a managerial standpoint to do business piecemeal, Mr. President.

822
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:14,639
I will support these items here tonight, only for the fact, Mr. President, is that these issues have been on our agenda and on our plate, turnout gear for almost two years now.

823
00:58:15,439 --> 00:58:17,000
So these aren't new items.

824
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:21,501
And I appreciate Councilor Penta coming up and Councilor Camuso.

825
00:58:22,255 --> 00:58:22,835
Um, it's great.

826
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:24,756
We have, uh, how many councils do we have?

827
00:58:24,796 --> 00:58:27,257
Nine counselors in the room tonight.

828
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:28,457
That's great.

829
00:58:29,117 --> 00:58:33,118
Uh, Mr. President, we should get all the other past ones to come down also.

830
00:58:33,959 --> 00:58:41,841
But I would state, Mr. President, that, um, moving forward and to me, it doesn't matter the state of the city speech tomorrow.

831
00:58:42,181 --> 00:58:42,821
That's great.

832
00:58:42,982 --> 00:58:44,322
And I hope it works out for the mayor.

833
00:58:44,769 --> 00:58:50,891
But I'm not hinging my vote on the mayor's speech tomorrow night, because these are items I believe we have to move forward.

834
00:58:51,392 --> 00:59:01,776
But after this, Mr. President, I do believe, as was mentioned by Councilor Penta, we have to have not just a draft capital plan, but a plan on the direction we want to go in.

835
00:59:02,336 --> 00:59:04,698
because at some point we're going to be pitted.

836
00:59:04,718 --> 00:59:07,660
Hey, you want to spend for this or are you going to spend for that?

837
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,682
And I think we should have a vision as a council.

838
00:59:11,023 --> 00:59:17,628
We may not share the same vision with the mayor, but as a council, we should have a vision and the direction we want to see this city move.

839
00:59:18,528 --> 00:59:19,109
And you know,

840
00:59:19,676 --> 00:59:21,698
Like I said, I'm prepared to vote on this tonight.

841
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:23,679
These things are well warranted.

842
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,743
We know the DPW, you see their trucks driving around.

843
00:59:28,043 --> 00:59:30,165
Their blades are all chewed up, Mr. President.

844
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:32,106
Their equipment is old and outdated.

845
00:59:33,167 --> 00:59:34,688
And this is a way to replenish it.

846
00:59:34,948 --> 00:59:45,357
I've talked to the men and women in the police department that are driving around in cruisers, as I referred to a couple of weeks ago, Fred Flintstone vehicles, where you could put your feet through the floorboards.

847
00:59:45,806 --> 00:59:49,928
That's how bad some of these vehicles are getting, Mr. President, and that's not a joke.

848
00:59:50,809 --> 00:59:53,010
So we do need relief in this way.

849
00:59:53,351 --> 00:59:54,611
I think this will go a long way.

850
00:59:54,651 --> 01:00:06,118
The turnout gear, we heard from the chief of the fire department stating a few weeks back that when these firefighters are in a fire, they come back with the same gear.

851
01:00:06,378 --> 01:00:11,841
They have to wait for one washing machine that is specially used to wash this equipment.

852
01:00:14,851 --> 01:00:20,379
So they have to wait in line to use the equipment, and they don't have a second gear, God forbid, there's a second fire.

853
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:31,114
And we all know the carcinogens and so forth that, from a fire that can, the soot and everything else that goes on the uniform, it's very dangerous for the brave men and women of the fire department.

854
01:00:31,835 --> 01:00:37,600
You know, I don't want anyone to believe that if this council did sit on this for a week, that we're sitting on public safety.

855
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,804
Because these issues have been out here for months, and if not years.

856
01:00:42,244 --> 01:00:44,766
And it's not this council that's been sitting on anything.

857
01:00:45,006 --> 01:00:50,671
This council has been the advocate on behalf of the police, DPW, and fire department in this community, Mr. President.

858
01:00:51,111 --> 01:00:51,472
Thank you.

859
01:00:52,793 --> 01:00:54,574
Thank you, Vice President Max.

860
01:00:55,275 --> 01:00:58,598
On the motion by Councilor De La Russo, seconded by Councilor Knight.

861
01:01:00,258 --> 01:01:02,219
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

862
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:04,620
Councilor DelaRusso?

863
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:05,120
Yes.

864
01:01:05,821 --> 01:01:06,641
Councilor Falco?

865
01:01:06,661 --> 01:01:06,921
Yes.

866
01:01:07,401 --> 01:01:07,942
Councilor Knight?

867
01:01:08,542 --> 01:01:08,762
Yes.

868
01:01:09,462 --> 01:01:10,383
Councilor Long and Kern?

869
01:01:10,423 --> 01:01:10,583
Yes.

870
01:01:11,123 --> 01:01:11,924
Vice President Marks?

871
01:01:11,984 --> 01:01:12,224
Yes.

872
01:01:12,704 --> 01:01:13,564
Councilor Scott Pelley?

873
01:01:13,624 --> 01:01:13,885
Yes.

874
01:01:14,405 --> 01:01:15,205
President Caviello?

875
01:01:15,465 --> 01:01:15,725
Yes.

876
01:01:16,186 --> 01:01:18,427
Motion of seven in the affirmative.

877
01:01:18,607 --> 01:01:19,327
Motion passes.

878
01:01:19,407 --> 01:01:22,229
And I think this was a well-deserved thing.

879
01:01:22,289 --> 01:01:23,529
These men in these departments.

880
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:30,097
need this, and if I may yield the chair to Vice President Marx.

881
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:36,780
Chief Sack?

882
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,341
Mr. President, I just wanted to say thank you very much for your vote here tonight.

883
01:01:40,361 --> 01:01:42,882
It means a lot to the men and women of the police department.

884
01:01:43,002 --> 01:01:43,322
Thank you.

885
01:01:43,782 --> 01:01:44,423
Thank you, Chief.

886
01:01:47,324 --> 01:01:48,624
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

887
01:01:48,664 --> 01:01:50,545
Paper 17-061, offered by President Caviello.

888
01:01:54,005 --> 01:02:04,027
being resolved that the Meffitt City Council request that the mayor allocate funds so that we are able to put names of the seven Meffitt veterans on the plaques at Honor Roll Park.

889
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:13,410
We would like to attempt to have this done by Memorial Day in May so that a ceremony could be held the day or by the Veterans Day in November.

890
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:15,470
Council President Caviello.

891
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:17,291
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

892
01:02:18,191 --> 01:02:23,412
Mr. Vice President, this is something, there's some World War II veterans

893
01:02:23,837 --> 01:02:26,838
that are on the list there, that have been there for a little bit.

894
01:02:26,918 --> 01:02:28,939
I think there's only like seven or eight names on there.

895
01:02:29,539 --> 01:02:37,522
And these World War II veterans are getting old, and I think they'd like to see their name on the wall before they pass away.

896
01:02:37,982 --> 01:02:46,225
So if we could ask the mayor to find some funding and some budget or somewhere to get those seven or eight names on there.

897
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:53,107
And if we could also maybe put an ad in the paper for any other veterans that maybe have missed out.

898
01:02:53,824 --> 01:03:01,709
So if we could do that, it'd be very helpful, especially to the World War II veterans who are passing at 1,000 a day.

899
01:03:02,489 --> 01:03:04,690
So I ask that to the mayor.

900
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:05,791
Thank you, Mr. President.

901
01:03:05,851 --> 01:03:06,411
Councilor Knight.

902
01:03:07,092 --> 01:03:10,234
Councilor Caviello, thank you very much for bringing this resolution forward.

903
01:03:11,014 --> 01:03:13,876
And I really think this is an important issue, Mr. President.

904
01:03:13,896 --> 01:03:16,577
I have brought a resolution of similar nature up in the past.

905
01:03:17,198 --> 01:03:21,100
And ultimately, these men and women didn't wait, didn't tell us to wait.

906
01:03:22,001 --> 01:03:22,642
when we needed them.

907
01:03:23,002 --> 01:03:26,965
They enlisted in the armed services, and they went overseas, and they fought for their country.

908
01:03:27,546 --> 01:03:30,688
And I really think that this should be done annually, Mr. President, on Memorial Day.

909
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:33,550
I think every Memorial Day, they should be adding names to the list.

910
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:39,715
If there's one eligible applicant whose name is eligible to be on that list, then every Memorial Day, we should be doing it.

911
01:03:40,236 --> 01:03:41,957
These individuals didn't tell us to wait.

912
01:03:42,157 --> 01:03:43,819
We shouldn't be telling them to wait, Mr. President.

913
01:03:43,859 --> 01:03:46,561
I support Counselor Caviello's resolution wholeheartedly.

914
01:03:46,581 --> 01:03:50,464
I ask that it be amended and ask the mayor to implement an annual celebration on Memorial Day.

915
01:03:50,842 --> 01:03:58,067
where any eligible individuals can be added to the plaque, regardless of the number of individuals that are awaiting placement on a roll pack, Mr. President.

916
01:03:58,648 --> 01:03:59,328
Thank you, Counselor.

917
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:00,189
Counselor Scott Pelley.

918
01:04:00,849 --> 01:04:01,730
Thank you, Mr. President.

919
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:06,514
I, too, echo my colleague's remarks.

920
01:04:06,614 --> 01:04:17,422
I think that we all have someone that has talked to us in the past year with myself and the men and women that fought for our country.

921
01:04:19,437 --> 01:04:33,923
For some families that have really pushed this, it's been frightening for the fact that they're seeing their loved ones who fought for our country enter their final stages of their lives.

922
01:04:35,326 --> 01:04:40,488
One thing they wanna see is the honor of having their names put on that wall.

923
01:04:40,568 --> 01:04:55,875
So if there's anything that, if we can really push this through and make sure that we can make this happen for our men and women, and I echo Councilor Knight's remarks that this is something we should do every year because you never know what tomorrow brings.

924
01:04:55,935 --> 01:05:01,558
So I really appreciate Councilor Caviello for bringing this up, and thank you very much.

925
01:05:02,209 --> 01:05:03,390
Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelley.

926
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:04,130
Councilor Falco.

927
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,271
Thank you, Mr. President.

928
01:05:05,351 --> 01:05:11,834
I also want to say that I agree with my fellow colleagues and President Caviello.

929
01:05:11,894 --> 01:05:13,175
I think this is a great resolution.

930
01:05:14,455 --> 01:05:18,358
There's so many men and women in our community that have made sacrifice.

931
01:05:18,378 --> 01:05:19,858
Some have made the ultimate sacrifice.

932
01:05:19,998 --> 01:05:23,460
And we should be making an effort to do this every year.

933
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:24,041
I agree.

934
01:05:24,941 --> 01:05:28,623
We have a ceremony every year at Oak Grove Cemetery.

935
01:05:29,345 --> 01:05:33,649
And this year, actually, we had a procession from Oak Grove down to the World War II Monument.

936
01:05:33,669 --> 01:05:37,653
We're actually at Veterans Memorial right near the high school.

937
01:05:38,294 --> 01:05:52,748
And I think to include this as part of that celebration every year, recognizing our veterans, we should make this part of the yearly Memorial Day exercises, unveiling the new names every year.

938
01:05:53,570 --> 01:06:05,855
So if we could amend the resolution to actually make this part of this year's Memorial Day exercises, to have an unveiling of the new names, that'd be great.

939
01:06:06,456 --> 01:06:07,116
Thank you, Councilor.

940
01:06:07,136 --> 01:06:07,536
Thank you.

941
01:06:07,836 --> 01:06:08,737
Councilor Del Rosso.

942
01:06:09,437 --> 01:06:10,437
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

943
01:06:10,618 --> 01:06:16,520
I want to thank Councilor Carviello for his tireless efforts on behalf of the veterans of our community.

944
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:23,103
He's shown true leadership in this part of our civic life.

945
01:06:23,617 --> 01:06:25,498
So I say thank you to you, Mr. President.

946
01:06:25,778 --> 01:06:26,378
Thank you.

947
01:06:26,538 --> 01:06:28,399
With regards to this motion, I support it.

948
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:40,803
I'm under the impression that every year we allocate funds in the approval of our budget for celebrations, ribbons, festoons, and streamers, or whatever it's called, that line item.

949
01:06:41,144 --> 01:06:43,104
So do we know if there's money in there?

950
01:06:43,484 --> 01:06:44,485
I do not know, Mr. President.

951
01:06:45,185 --> 01:06:52,608
I'm sure there's usually a surplus so that the money, which we've already allocated for this very purpose, be used.

952
01:06:55,810 --> 01:07:09,495
On the motion of, uh, Councilor President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Lungo Kern, further amended by Councilor Knight, Falco, and DelaRusso.

953
01:07:11,635 --> 01:07:12,376
All those in favor?

954
01:07:13,056 --> 01:07:13,176
Aye.

955
01:07:13,636 --> 01:07:14,096
Opposed?

956
01:07:15,497 --> 01:07:16,157
The ayes have it.

957
01:07:17,057 --> 01:07:18,057
The motion is adopted.

958
01:07:19,478 --> 01:07:19,718
Thank you.

959
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:31,376
Thank you.

960
01:07:31,396 --> 01:07:33,198
17-062 offered by Councilor Falco.

961
01:07:34,118 --> 01:07:45,607
Be it resolved that Mayor Berk and Chief Sacco contact the United States Postal Service, Method Square location regarding the Postal Service trucks parking on Forest Street in the interest of public safety.

962
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:50,411
Councilor Falco.

963
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:54,055
Thank you, Mr. President.

964
01:07:54,475 --> 01:08:01,878
First of all, I'd like to thank, sincere thanks to Chief Sacco and the command staff and the men and women that work in the Medford Police Department.

965
01:08:02,839 --> 01:08:11,463
We had a most recent community meeting this past Wednesday at Breed Hall, the old Sacred Heart Church up on the hillside.

966
01:08:12,063 --> 01:08:14,945
And this was an issue that came up during that meeting.

967
01:08:15,685 --> 01:08:21,508
The postal trucks that park outside of the Medford Postal Office

968
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:23,751
Basically, every night they line up on.

969
01:08:23,771 --> 01:08:24,732
Excuse me.

970
01:08:27,434 --> 01:08:27,854
Excuse me.

971
01:08:28,634 --> 01:08:30,315
Mr. Cassidy, if you could please.

972
01:08:30,876 --> 01:08:31,416
Thank you, sir.

973
01:08:31,896 --> 01:08:33,598
I'm sorry, Mr. Counselor Falco.

974
01:08:33,638 --> 01:08:33,998
Thank you.

975
01:08:35,099 --> 01:08:36,680
Basically, every night they line up.

976
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,060
They park on Forest Street.

977
01:08:38,621 --> 01:08:39,822
They're big, bulky trucks.

978
01:08:39,842 --> 01:08:44,785
So for anyone that lives in the old Bedford High School condominiums, it's really hard.

979
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:52,113
to navigate that area and to get out of the parking lot in the morning and at night, so it's become a bit of a safety hazard.

980
01:08:52,853 --> 01:08:56,835
So if we could just, if the chief and the mayor reach out to the U.S.

981
01:08:56,855 --> 01:09:10,900
Postal Service, the Medford branch, and just find out, I guess, what the strategy is with regard to those trucks, because it seems like over the years, from what I'm hearing, there's more and more trucks all the time.

982
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:13,121
It used to be just a few, now there's a bunch.

983
01:09:13,141 --> 01:09:14,742
I went down Forest Street on

984
01:09:15,616 --> 01:09:17,336
Sunday morning, they were all lined up.

985
01:09:18,997 --> 01:09:21,597
They took all the parking spaces in front of the old Medford High School.

986
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:31,120
So if we can find out if they have plans to actually find additional parking somewhere in the city for these vehicles, because it's becoming a safety hazard and something needs to be done about it.

987
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:39,401
I can report that I did go down to the post office to meet with the postal manager and the new manager was out sick for the last two days.

988
01:09:39,421 --> 01:09:42,062
And hopefully when I go back tomorrow, because I go there every day,

989
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:48,362
She will be in, and I've asked that maybe we could have a meeting to try to find some resolution on where to park the trucks.

990
01:09:48,602 --> 01:09:49,002
Thank you.

991
01:09:49,062 --> 01:09:54,484
And if I may, Mr. President, I believe there is a member of the community that would like to speak on this issue.

992
01:09:55,444 --> 01:09:56,025
Or maybe a few.

993
01:09:59,026 --> 01:09:59,326
Thank you.

994
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:00,426
Name and address of the record, please.

995
01:10:00,506 --> 01:10:01,626
Good evening, President.

996
01:10:02,327 --> 01:10:05,068
Sharon Diesso, 130 Circuit Road in Mass Ave.

997
01:10:05,588 --> 01:10:06,048
in Medford.

998
01:10:06,791 --> 01:10:11,400
I want to wish you a belated healthy new year and thank you for your time for 2017.

999
01:10:12,002 --> 01:10:16,090
I just had a couple of small matters that I wanted to bring up.

1000
01:10:18,197 --> 01:10:26,262
verse me on because I'm not sure how the system works and learning things from different meetings and hearing councilor Pinter in Camuso, et cetera.

1001
01:10:27,062 --> 01:10:40,571
Um, first of all, for a community that's well known on the map, um, my neighbors and I had to wait seven years for a strategic stop sign down by Ashcroft road.

1002
01:10:40,591 --> 01:10:41,331
Could I interrupt you?

1003
01:10:41,972 --> 01:10:43,913
We're talking about the post office right at the moment.

1004
01:10:44,433 --> 01:10:45,474
Oh, I thought you were finished.

1005
01:10:45,494 --> 01:10:46,555
We're talking about the post office.

1006
01:10:46,935 --> 01:10:48,296
If you'd like to come back later and speak.

1007
01:10:48,496 --> 01:10:48,917
Oh, sure.

1008
01:10:48,977 --> 01:10:50,678
Uh, uh, uh, later, later.

1009
01:10:51,599 --> 01:10:53,480
Yeah.

1010
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:54,541
So, okay.

1011
01:10:58,564 --> 01:10:59,525
Name and address of the record, please.

1012
01:10:59,905 --> 01:11:03,008
Good evening, John Costas, uh, 25 Salem Street, Medford.

1013
01:11:03,808 --> 01:11:07,471
And, uh, that's a, a sore subject with me.

1014
01:11:07,912 --> 01:11:11,935
I mean, you just brought it up now, but I've been dealing with that for over three years.

1015
01:11:13,047 --> 01:11:20,750
It started out as one truck that used to park in the theater parking lot, and then they were gracious enough to park it in front of their own post office.

1016
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:30,013
As time goes on, as of November, there were 16 post office trucks parked from one end of Forest Street to the other.

1017
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:32,834
And it's not like they're only there at night.

1018
01:11:33,554 --> 01:11:37,536
Some of these trucks are there for three, four days, and they never move.

1019
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:48,205
Case in point, Mayor Burke's been trying to help us on it, because we've been getting a lot of complaints from the renters, because you can't see the theater when there's five trucks parked in front of the theater.

1020
01:11:49,045 --> 01:11:52,046
And we try to tell the post office, and they yes me to death.

1021
01:11:53,127 --> 01:11:55,028
Sometimes they move, and sometimes they don't.

1022
01:11:55,868 --> 01:12:01,011
Well, this year, Mayor Burke had spoken with the manager and gave them a solution.

1023
01:12:01,211 --> 01:12:06,433
Because every time I talked to the post office manager, their complaint was, well, what do you want us to do?

1024
01:12:06,553 --> 01:12:07,514
They don't belong there.

1025
01:12:07,554 --> 01:12:07,854
However.

1026
01:12:08,823 --> 01:12:09,924
Nice people here in Medford.

1027
01:12:10,604 --> 01:12:12,145
We're going to give you public property.

1028
01:12:12,885 --> 01:12:15,386
All you have to do is park your trucks there.

1029
01:12:16,447 --> 01:12:21,110
And one time when we had some big events at the theater, all the trucks were parked behind here.

1030
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:22,430
It was wonderful.

1031
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:28,754
If you ever noticed that a couple of weekends, there were no US Postal trucks overnight on Forest Street, because they were here.

1032
01:12:29,634 --> 01:12:33,036
But after about two days, they're back on Forest Street.

1033
01:12:33,576 --> 01:12:34,977
And unless you ask them to move it,

1034
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:40,902
They may or may not get the word to the driver's case in point on the KPM Big Bend.

1035
01:12:42,843 --> 01:12:44,344
They agreed to park them here.

1036
01:12:45,024 --> 01:12:47,465
Well, there were three that was parking in front of the theater that night.

1037
01:12:48,245 --> 01:12:48,925
And I stopped them.

1038
01:12:48,965 --> 01:12:50,126
I said, you can't park here.

1039
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:50,986
We got the OK.

1040
01:12:51,006 --> 01:12:51,987
You need to park over there.

1041
01:12:52,027 --> 01:12:53,267
And they said, well, no one told us.

1042
01:12:54,528 --> 01:12:56,268
I said, well, why don't you call your manager?

1043
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:58,109
Because you're not supposed to park here.

1044
01:12:58,529 --> 01:12:59,670
And they had to call the manager.

1045
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:04,652
And the manager forgot to tell them, don't park on Forest Street on that Saturday night.

1046
01:13:05,956 --> 01:13:08,457
Uh, so they moved, they were nice and they moved and everything.

1047
01:13:08,498 --> 01:13:15,501
So whatever you can do, I know the mayor is trying, but it's a post office and you, I think you have to use a little more.

1048
01:13:16,202 --> 01:13:18,363
I think it's going to be more than just have another meeting.

1049
01:13:19,364 --> 01:13:24,707
We've had meetings and it works for a little pile and then they just go back to their, their old ways.

1050
01:13:24,747 --> 01:13:26,207
So thank you.

1051
01:13:26,327 --> 01:13:26,628
Thank you.

1052
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:27,448
Councilor Falco.

1053
01:13:27,628 --> 01:13:27,888
Thank you.

1054
01:13:31,668 --> 01:13:33,609
I was just going to second the resolution.

1055
01:13:33,649 --> 01:13:35,329
I've received a number of complaints, too.

1056
01:13:35,389 --> 01:13:42,351
And I was also going to ask if it's something that's been happening lately, because I've noticed it a lot on Forest Street.

1057
01:13:42,471 --> 01:13:45,231
But I think Mr. Costa just confirmed November.

1058
01:13:45,292 --> 01:13:46,052
It's gotten worse.

1059
01:13:46,632 --> 01:13:47,612
It's gotten a lot worse.

1060
01:13:47,692 --> 01:13:50,313
And yeah, it's terrible to be blocking the Chevalier.

1061
01:13:50,433 --> 01:13:55,074
And I did get complaints from people that live in the old high school that are having trouble.

1062
01:13:55,374 --> 01:13:56,774
So I just wanted to back you up on that.

1063
01:13:56,814 --> 01:13:58,855
I think the mayor needs to figure something out.

1064
01:13:59,273 --> 01:14:17,564
with regards to asking the post office to create their own plan, whether, if they're going to have trucks that are out of service for months at a time, then they do need to take them across the city, it's only about five minutes, seven minutes, to West Medford and park it where there is a lot, or figure out how to use the city hall parking lot that the mayor is graciously offering.

1065
01:14:17,844 --> 01:14:21,066
But they do need to come up with a plan for public safety purposes.

1066
01:14:21,927 --> 01:14:22,807
Thank you, Councilwoman Oprah.

1067
01:14:23,148 --> 01:14:23,648
Councilor Knight.

1068
01:14:24,235 --> 01:14:31,198
Mr. President, I move to amend the paper to request that the Traffic Commission examine the feasibility of implementing a commercial vehicle parking ban along Forest Street.

1069
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:36,860
That the Traffic Commission study that.

1070
01:14:38,381 --> 01:14:40,682
Examine the feasibility, not implement, just examine it.

1071
01:14:40,702 --> 01:14:52,027
Look, if that's something that's possible that they can do, can they put a commercial parking ban in place there in front of the Chevalier Auditorium, maybe a little bit further out in front of the old high school to alleviate some of the public safety concerns, whether it's certain spaces that are

1072
01:14:53,032 --> 01:14:58,734
at the end of a driveway or certain spaces that are in front of the theater, Mr. President, to keep those areas open.

1073
01:14:59,334 --> 01:14:59,654
Thank you.

1074
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:01,174
Vice President Marks.

1075
01:15:01,954 --> 01:15:03,035
Thank you, Mr. President.

1076
01:15:03,055 --> 01:15:09,296
And just to touch upon what Councilor Knight just mentioned, there is a parking ban for commercial vehicles after midnight.

1077
01:15:09,956 --> 01:15:10,397
Yes, there is.

1078
01:15:10,897 --> 01:15:15,898
So I'm not sure I would consider these postal trucks commercial vehicles.

1079
01:15:16,473 --> 01:15:19,835
They may not have a commercial plate, but they are indeed commercial vehicles.

1080
01:15:20,335 --> 01:15:32,721
And maybe that may be our plan of attack, Mr. President, is to, you know, start tagging these vehicles like we tag any other commercial vehicle that's overnight and see what the response is from the Postal Department.

1081
01:15:32,881 --> 01:15:39,245
As was mentioned by Mr. Costas, this has been an issue for a lot, a lot of months, many, many months.

1082
01:15:39,945 --> 01:15:43,727
And I thought it was resolved some months back when the mayor intervened.

1083
01:15:44,845 --> 01:15:47,426
and offer the parking out here behind City Hall.

1084
01:15:48,726 --> 01:15:56,347
I'm not sure how postal workers that walk for a living can say they don't want to walk behind City Hall from Forest Street.

1085
01:15:57,107 --> 01:16:07,929
But, you know, maybe if that's too far, maybe we can look at the public lot right on Salem Street, Mr. President, where many of the postal workers park during the day with the business permit parking.

1086
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:12,070
So that may be an alternative to park the trucks in there overnight.

1087
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,141
which is a little closer than behind City Hall.

1088
01:16:14,501 --> 01:16:18,803
So maybe we can offer that also, Mr. President, as a... Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1089
01:16:19,463 --> 01:16:25,565
On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Longo Kern, roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk.

1090
01:16:25,585 --> 01:16:27,286
As amended, Mr. President.

1091
01:16:27,306 --> 01:16:28,487
As amended by Councilor Knight.

1092
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:37,170
Councilor De La Rucia.

1093
01:16:37,530 --> 01:16:37,770
Yes.

1094
01:16:38,471 --> 01:16:39,191
Councilor Falco.

1095
01:16:39,231 --> 01:16:39,451
Yes.

1096
01:16:39,951 --> 01:16:40,472
Councilor Knight.

1097
01:16:40,612 --> 01:16:40,772
Yes.

1098
01:16:41,782 --> 01:16:42,602
Councilor Long and Kern.

1099
01:16:42,722 --> 01:16:42,942
Yes.

1100
01:16:43,423 --> 01:16:44,183
Vice President Marks.

1101
01:16:45,243 --> 01:16:45,543
Yes.

1102
01:16:45,983 --> 01:16:46,804
Councilor Scott Pelli.

1103
01:16:46,884 --> 01:16:47,104
Yes.

1104
01:16:47,684 --> 01:16:48,364
President Caviello.

1105
01:16:48,424 --> 01:16:48,664
Yes.

1106
01:16:48,884 --> 01:16:49,645
Seven in the affirmative.

1107
01:16:49,665 --> 01:16:51,145
None in the negative.

1108
01:16:51,205 --> 01:16:51,906
Motion passes.

1109
01:16:51,926 --> 01:16:56,807
Motion by Councilor Long and Kern due for suspension so that the citizen may speak.

1110
01:17:00,448 --> 01:17:01,549
Name and address for the record, please.

1111
01:17:01,869 --> 01:17:05,830
Sharon Dias of 130 Circuit Road in Mass Ave in Medford.

1112
01:17:06,531 --> 01:17:10,532
Um, I just wanted to say, first of all, even before the sign issue,

1113
01:17:11,385 --> 01:17:17,067
I wanted to thank, and I got a chance to do it in person, the fine fire department that we have here.

1114
01:17:18,067 --> 01:17:27,670
There are some things I'm sort of not touchy-feely with at home, and I had a bleep going off in the house last week, and I finally tracked it down to the carbon monoxide device.

1115
01:17:28,230 --> 01:17:33,572
So I pulled it out of the wall, and five minutes later, it started bleeping again on a chair.

1116
01:17:34,152 --> 01:17:38,914
So I'm like, okay, this is kind of spooky, but maybe I should plug it back in.

1117
01:17:40,254 --> 01:17:41,055
And it bleeped again.

1118
01:17:41,616 --> 01:17:46,861
So I said, maybe, and I called the neighbor and I said, I think I'm going to have to sleep with my windows open tonight.

1119
01:17:46,881 --> 01:17:48,083
And they said, no, don't do that.

1120
01:17:48,643 --> 01:17:54,490
So I called the fire department, left the device on the front porch, and it started bleeping on the front porch.

1121
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,973
So up they came five minutes later.

1122
01:17:57,393 --> 01:17:59,715
the old trusty guys with the boots and everything else.

1123
01:18:00,335 --> 01:18:12,823
And they went right through my house, very courteously, did their job with the monitors, explained something to me about the device, and made sure I checked and see if I was okay, and then they left.

1124
01:18:12,843 --> 01:18:13,724
So thank you again.

1125
01:18:13,744 --> 01:18:16,605
I just happened to see him here tonight, good timing.

1126
01:18:17,106 --> 01:18:22,089
So we have some really fine police and people who are looking for our safety.

1127
01:18:22,589 --> 01:18:26,692
So on the line of safety, I have two notes tonight.

1128
01:18:27,391 --> 01:18:38,474
Um, it's highly unordinary that a very busy corner that is complained about, written about, called about, written about, met about, should wait seven years for a stop sign.

1129
01:18:39,135 --> 01:18:41,075
I think it's, I think it's unacceptable.

1130
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:42,976
And Ashcroft road.

1131
01:18:43,376 --> 01:18:44,176
Ashcroft road.

1132
01:18:44,796 --> 01:18:44,956
Yeah.

1133
01:18:45,617 --> 01:18:46,317
Ashcroft road.

1134
01:18:46,537 --> 01:18:47,037
Ashcroft road.

1135
01:18:47,137 --> 01:18:47,317
Yeah.

1136
01:18:47,417 --> 01:18:48,557
And corner of Mass Ave.

1137
01:18:49,598 --> 01:18:50,158
It's in now.

1138
01:18:50,858 --> 01:18:52,159
So we kind of gave up.

1139
01:18:52,979 --> 01:18:57,000
So about two weeks ago I was coming home and I saw the stop sign.

1140
01:18:57,467 --> 01:19:01,769
So thank you, whoever did, in the end, after my letters, get it in.

1141
01:19:02,469 --> 01:19:02,930
It's OK.

1142
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:11,053
But on the whole light of everything, that's not acceptable in any city, whether it be Kalamazoo or Medford, Massachusetts.

1143
01:19:11,073 --> 01:19:11,834
It's a long time.

1144
01:19:12,294 --> 01:19:15,455
We're waiting for someone, hopefully, never to get hit.

1145
01:19:15,555 --> 01:19:17,756
My neighbor's car was totaled on that corner.

1146
01:19:18,957 --> 01:19:22,138
We were hoping that no child or pedestrian would be involved.

1147
01:19:23,219 --> 01:19:26,020
So thanks again for anyone who did speak.

1148
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:28,971
I can't say speed it up, who accomplished this.

1149
01:19:29,832 --> 01:19:42,358
On Mystic Avenue, on the grounds of safety, coming north or going south, right by Joseph's Transportation, there is an island there that's about five inches high.

1150
01:19:42,999 --> 01:19:45,940
And it borders, it's the meridian.

1151
01:19:46,641 --> 01:19:54,905
If you're going north on Mystic Avenue from Somerville, you have to take a turn towards the left to kind of

1152
01:19:55,325 --> 01:19:59,267
get by that island, you can go make a U-turn, take a left onto Harvard.

1153
01:19:59,607 --> 01:20:00,427
You can't go straight.

1154
01:20:01,007 --> 01:20:02,408
You can't see the island.

1155
01:20:02,848 --> 01:20:09,171
You dearly need reflectors there, because I was waiting for this too to happen.

1156
01:20:09,351 --> 01:20:13,993
Last week I was coming home from the college, and it might usually have fog at the end of the day.

1157
01:20:14,473 --> 01:20:16,374
And I'm like, oh, remember the island.

1158
01:20:16,394 --> 01:20:19,495
You have to watch for it, because it's not visible.

1159
01:20:20,303 --> 01:20:26,745
A man coming the other way, not at a high speed, took the turn, never saw the island, landed on the island.

1160
01:20:26,785 --> 01:20:29,946
People were yelling, and the poor guy was beside himself.

1161
01:20:30,907 --> 01:20:31,767
Everyone stopped.

1162
01:20:32,147 --> 01:20:33,447
He was able to back off.

1163
01:20:33,868 --> 01:20:41,830
He looked a little dazed, and then he went around, past Dunkin' Donuts and Harrows, and then proceeded south on Mystic Avenue.

1164
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:45,711
Is that state or is that section of the road Medford?

1165
01:20:45,751 --> 01:20:46,672
That is a state road.

1166
01:20:46,832 --> 01:20:47,212
It is correct.

1167
01:20:47,812 --> 01:20:49,193
So what's the next route for me?

1168
01:20:49,493 --> 01:20:52,315
We can refer that to a counselor.

1169
01:20:52,575 --> 01:20:55,837
I think also Barbara, I mean representative Barbara, that's her district.

1170
01:20:55,937 --> 01:20:58,718
And I can call her tomorrow and make that request.

1171
01:20:58,738 --> 01:21:02,480
Especially with the snow coming, they're probably going to have to put the newer, higher reflectors.

1172
01:21:02,901 --> 01:21:04,281
I hope you're in agreement with this.

1173
01:21:04,622 --> 01:21:04,962
Okay.

1174
01:21:05,502 --> 01:21:14,247
Um, also on monies, um, I was reading, um, during the year that, uh, did you get finalized that you had a commission that was paid?

1175
01:21:15,130 --> 01:21:20,914
to look at the, um, structure that's across from the bus terminal near the old cemetery.

1176
01:21:21,615 --> 01:21:24,957
And that's going to be pot grant money in pot $250,000.

1177
01:21:25,138 --> 01:21:28,020
That's a quarter of a million dollars.

1178
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:36,286
That's 250 quarters of taxpayers, maybe thousand dollars a quarters to erect something there.

1179
01:21:36,622 --> 01:21:37,983
where people can eat their lunch.

1180
01:21:38,503 --> 01:21:39,224
This is winter.

1181
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:42,386
How many people do you really think are going to go in there and eat lunch?

1182
01:21:42,947 --> 01:21:46,950
It is beside my friends and I how things like this get passed.

1183
01:21:47,410 --> 01:21:50,953
How many cruises could have been bought during the years with $250,000?

1184
01:21:52,454 --> 01:21:54,775
Just because you get a grant and somebody has an idea that

1185
01:21:55,616 --> 01:21:56,817
that structure hasn't been used.

1186
01:21:57,277 --> 01:22:01,238
You know, we really, we respect you so much and we need you here to hear our voices.

1187
01:22:01,758 --> 01:22:04,039
But couldn't that money be allocated at one time?

1188
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:08,241
Couldn't someone come forth and say, wait a minute, we have a better place to spend $250,000.

1189
01:22:08,781 --> 01:22:14,123
And I was here last year when the police chief was coming up practically begging for new equipment.

1190
01:22:14,644 --> 01:22:20,006
You know, this could have been processed and these gentlemen would not have to have been here tonight.

1191
01:22:20,766 --> 01:22:25,291
So, I don't know if that's possible, if you can rethink money during the year.

1192
01:22:25,671 --> 01:22:29,195
I really think if you had a leak in your roof, you wouldn't go fix your shed.

1193
01:22:29,815 --> 01:22:31,857
So, thank you for listening to me.

1194
01:22:31,937 --> 01:22:34,380
I'm just a peon when it comes to economics.

1195
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:34,720
Thank you.

1196
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:38,084
And I will speak to Representative Roberts tomorrow about that.

1197
01:22:38,104 --> 01:22:38,364
Thank you.

1198
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:38,824
Thank you.

1199
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:41,907
Motion by Councilor Lococo to revert back to regular business.

1200
01:22:44,835 --> 01:23:04,078
16-0-6, 17-0-6-3, offered by Councilor Falco, whereas the Medford Board of Appeals meets on a monthly basis to make decisions about various projects and developments, whereas many of the meetings are conducted in room 201 in Medford City Hall, where there is a limited amount of seating.

1201
01:23:05,599 --> 01:23:13,720
Be it resolved that moving forward that all Medford Board of Appeals meetings take place in all the chambers at City Hall to give all residents

1202
01:23:14,558 --> 01:23:17,160
the opportunity to attend and to participate.

1203
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:18,260
Counselor Belko.

1204
01:23:19,341 --> 01:23:20,542
Thank you, Mr. President.

1205
01:23:21,302 --> 01:23:35,211
Throughout the years, I've gone to many Board of Appeals meetings just to see different, just to, you know, when the different issues come up on the agenda, just go down and take a look to see what's going on in the community.

1206
01:23:35,791 --> 01:23:39,353
And I mean, I've gotten calls from other people as well that have attended these meetings.

1207
01:23:39,954 --> 01:23:41,715
And usually the meetings are held in room 201,

1208
01:23:43,537 --> 01:23:47,298
for the most part, and in room 201, there's very limited seating.

1209
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:57,862
I think it's about maybe 20 seats, a table up in the front, and it seems like any meeting you go to, if there's a big issue, there are a number of people just standing in the hallways.

1210
01:23:57,902 --> 01:24:11,846
They can't weigh in on any type of issue, or they have to wait in line, or they missed a presentation that maybe the developer's giving, and it just doesn't seem, in this day and age, like it's a proper place to have a meeting.

1211
01:24:12,524 --> 01:24:13,985
There's no audio visual equipment.

1212
01:24:14,445 --> 01:24:16,407
There's, it's just too small.

1213
01:24:17,027 --> 01:24:18,428
I don't find it very transparent.

1214
01:24:18,448 --> 01:24:23,011
If you have to wait in the hallway and you can't even hear what's going on in the room, it doesn't make sense.

1215
01:24:23,432 --> 01:24:24,352
We live in a big city.

1216
01:24:24,853 --> 01:24:28,455
We've over 55,000 close to 60,000 people live here.

1217
01:24:29,616 --> 01:24:31,377
This community is hot for development.

1218
01:24:31,877 --> 01:24:39,903
People want to develop and there are many development meetings and zoning board decisions that have happened in the past and that will be happening in the future.

1219
01:24:40,787 --> 01:24:46,771
and everyone should be able to weigh in on these different issues that come before the zoning board.

1220
01:24:48,573 --> 01:24:50,574
If I may finish.

1221
01:24:52,155 --> 01:24:56,859
In my opinion, I believe that those meetings should be held here in chambers.

1222
01:24:57,119 --> 01:25:03,063
I know they meet on Tuesday night usually, which is the same night as us, but what they can do is maybe they can move to Wednesday nights.

1223
01:25:03,743 --> 01:25:05,024
They can pick a different night.

1224
01:25:05,205 --> 01:25:09,788
Wednesday nights, I don't think this chamber is being used on a regular basis, but it needs to be looked at.

1225
01:25:10,653 --> 01:25:24,525
We need to make this process—we need to bring the process into the 21st century where people can come, if there's a presentation, they can use the AV equipment here, but it shouldn't be in a room where you could barely fit 20 people and people feel like they're excluded.

1226
01:25:25,626 --> 01:25:27,608
You know, government should be transparent.

1227
01:25:27,648 --> 01:25:28,489
That's what it's all about.

1228
01:25:28,989 --> 01:25:31,671
People should have access, and I think this would be a better venue.

1229
01:25:32,132 --> 01:25:32,452
Thank you.

1230
01:25:32,492 --> 01:25:33,273
I think the question is,

1231
01:25:33,797 --> 01:25:35,198
The meeting should be moved to Wednesday night.

1232
01:25:35,218 --> 01:25:39,442
So because the Board of Heals does meet on a Tuesday evening, the same as we do.

1233
01:25:39,682 --> 01:25:40,883
Absolutely.

1234
01:25:42,084 --> 01:25:47,388
If we could amend it to actually have them move their night to Wednesday night and have it here in council chambers.

1235
01:25:47,468 --> 01:25:47,869
Thank you.

1236
01:25:47,889 --> 01:25:49,190
Thank you, Mr. President.

1237
01:25:49,230 --> 01:25:50,451
As amended by Councilor Falco.

1238
01:25:50,531 --> 01:25:51,352
Councilor Longo-Kern.

1239
01:25:51,512 --> 01:25:53,033
Thank you, President Carviello.

1240
01:25:53,193 --> 01:25:56,056
I second the paper, second approval for the motion.

1241
01:25:57,697 --> 01:25:59,278
I've received complaints myself.

1242
01:25:59,358 --> 01:26:00,840
And as we come in on a Tuesday night,

1243
01:26:01,644 --> 01:26:07,448
during the once a month when the Zoning Board of Appeals meets, we see a crowd outside the hallway.

1244
01:26:07,488 --> 01:26:11,831
And I have received complaints about people that weren't able to speak, they weren't able to hear.

1245
01:26:12,251 --> 01:26:17,915
And I think it's extremely important that anybody and everybody be able to hear any meeting that goes on at City Hall.

1246
01:26:18,375 --> 01:26:23,899
But time after time, month after month, that is the one board that meets where the doors are overflowing.

1247
01:26:23,919 --> 01:26:27,782
Because you have attorneys, you have residents, you have business owners.

1248
01:26:28,267 --> 01:26:30,808
People from the city council do want to attend.

1249
01:26:30,868 --> 01:26:31,688
We're not able to.

1250
01:26:32,048 --> 01:26:34,148
So I agree with moving it to another night.

1251
01:26:34,569 --> 01:26:36,689
I also agree that here would be the right place.

1252
01:26:37,209 --> 01:26:41,410
I would ask that we amend this and request that the meetings be televised as well.

1253
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:47,252
I think we need to start moving more and more towards televised board and commission meetings.

1254
01:26:47,312 --> 01:26:50,692
And that is one of the biggest and most important boards we have in the city.

1255
01:26:51,092 --> 01:26:57,394
And it's something that I would definitely want to attend more often or at least be able to have that opportunity to watch from home.

1256
01:26:58,116 --> 01:27:04,381
We as city councilors are being asked to get involved with certain projects and ask for help.

1257
01:27:04,441 --> 01:27:05,642
Neighbors are asking us for help.

1258
01:27:05,702 --> 01:27:14,929
So it's important that we have that opportunity to not only watch the meetings, attend the meetings, speak at the meetings, but everybody should be able to attend the meetings and be able to hear and speak.

1259
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:22,495
So I think it's a great resolve, and I think it's definitely a positive, and I move approval, or second the approval of Councilor Falco.

1260
01:27:23,056 --> 01:27:23,856
Thank you, Councilor.

1261
01:27:24,117 --> 01:27:24,617
Councilor Knight.

1262
01:27:25,418 --> 01:27:27,640
Mr. President, I too feel as though the room is too small.

1263
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:34,685
I really don't see any problem with having the meetings at a room that has a capacity of no less than 100 people.

1264
01:27:34,705 --> 01:27:36,347
It doesn't necessarily have to be the Alden Chambers.

1265
01:27:37,107 --> 01:27:39,589
We had a great presentation here by Barbara Kerr a couple of weeks ago.

1266
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:43,532
Hopefully if we get a library grant, we're going to have a great library community space in the library.

1267
01:27:43,952 --> 01:27:46,554
We have the South Metro Fire Station as a community space.

1268
01:27:46,574 --> 01:27:47,315
So there are other

1269
01:27:48,165 --> 01:27:50,807
available locales that these meetings can be held.

1270
01:27:50,827 --> 01:27:54,030
If they want to use the Alden Chambers, that's all well and good too, Mr. President.

1271
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:55,571
But I do think that the room is too small.

1272
01:27:55,951 --> 01:28:08,241
I do think that they can take affirmative steps to address the problem right now, especially in light of the small number of contentious developments that have been before the Zoning Board of Appeals in recent months, Mr. President.

1273
01:28:08,261 --> 01:28:09,622
So I support the resolution.

1274
01:28:09,923 --> 01:28:13,966
However, I feel as though putting it in the Alden Chambers isn't necessarily the end-all, be-all.

1275
01:28:14,006 --> 01:28:15,467
There are other opportunities available.

1276
01:28:16,018 --> 01:28:25,520
And my question as to whether or not if we're going to send a message to the Zoning Board of Appeals that they need to have a meeting, and the meeting has to be accessible to people, that we're dictating where it has to be as well.

1277
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:33,162
I think that if we can look at the number of seats that are available in the room, I think that that might be able to be something that's helpful in controlling the situation as well, Mr. President.

1278
01:28:33,502 --> 01:28:38,863
However, in terms of the resolution that's before the body this evening, I have no problem supporting it as authored.

1279
01:28:39,304 --> 01:28:40,184
Thank you, Councilor Nighy.

1280
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,484
Councilor Del Rosso.

1281
01:28:41,504 --> 01:28:45,145
Mr. President, I agree with everything that's been presented, and I'm grateful

1282
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:49,451
Councilor Falco for bringing this up.

1283
01:28:49,812 --> 01:28:59,195
While this certainly has been discussed before on some level, however, I have a problem.

1284
01:28:59,496 --> 01:29:00,516
I won't say a problem.

1285
01:29:00,576 --> 01:29:14,922
I have a suggestion to remedy the language and that is to add the note of suggestion because I won't support this, Councilor, Mr. President, because on the grounds that that is a semi

1286
01:29:15,677 --> 01:29:16,517
judicial body.

1287
01:29:17,338 --> 01:29:23,220
It is to be independent from undue political influence, and I won't be a party to that.

1288
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:25,541
Thank you, Councilor Del Rosso.

1289
01:29:25,901 --> 01:29:26,801
Vice President Marks.

1290
01:29:27,802 --> 01:29:32,443
Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank Councilor Felkel for offering this tonight.

1291
01:29:33,524 --> 01:29:36,505
You know, I think this does apply across the board.

1292
01:29:36,785 --> 01:29:37,825
I know comments were made.

1293
01:29:38,466 --> 01:29:41,987
It's not just the Zoning Board or Community Development Board.

1294
01:29:42,387 --> 01:29:44,808
It's every board and commission, and I might add,

1295
01:29:45,190 --> 01:29:46,210
including this council.

1296
01:29:46,690 --> 01:29:51,792
There's been a number of meetings we've had in our council room in 207 where there was an overflow in the hall.

1297
01:29:52,572 --> 01:29:58,894
And I didn't hear an out cry about the, you know, the members of the council saying, make sure everyone's in here for transparency.

1298
01:29:59,334 --> 01:30:01,635
So I think we have to be very careful.

1299
01:30:02,478 --> 01:30:15,008
And I've been to these community development boards and the zoning boards, and in these meetings, they look at site plan, they look at schematics, and this is a tough setup to do in that type of format.

1300
01:30:15,788 --> 01:30:19,591
And that's why they have a lengthy table in front of them and so forth.

1301
01:30:20,012 --> 01:30:30,720
So I think what we can do is make a recommendation as a council that with any board and commission, including this council, if there is overflow, that they move into a larger capacity area.

1302
01:30:31,310 --> 01:30:36,311
And I think that covers everything, rather than saying you have to move here, you have to do this or do that.

1303
01:30:36,671 --> 01:30:37,771
I think that covers everything.

1304
01:30:37,811 --> 01:30:46,893
So if there's an overflow, Mr. President, I think common sense should prevail that you move into a room where everyone can participate, because that's what Councilor Falco is getting at.

1305
01:30:47,173 --> 01:30:50,093
This is a participating resolution.

1306
01:30:50,533 --> 01:30:55,814
It is open and transparent, and I agree with that.

1307
01:30:55,874 --> 01:31:00,515
But I'm not sure we solve all that by just having people come into this chamber.

1308
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:08,684
because they may have meetings with just a few people, and it'd be a difficult place to sit down with a few people, because it's not set up for that.

1309
01:31:09,484 --> 01:31:12,146
So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.

1310
01:31:12,506 --> 01:31:20,170
If an overflow takes place, that a suitable room be found by any board commission or Memphis City Council.

1311
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:23,932
As amended by Councilor, Vice President Marks.

1312
01:31:24,952 --> 01:31:25,492
Councilor Knight.

1313
01:31:26,052 --> 01:31:38,677
Mr. President, I thank Councilor Marks for bringing up the issue of the fact that there are many boards and commissions in this community and if we're going to be requesting a policy change, that the policy change should be across the board and should not be singling out one board or one commission.

1314
01:31:39,537 --> 01:31:48,540
I certainly also appreciate Councilor De La Russo's position that where we have quasi-judicial and quasi-independent boards here in the community that we do need to

1315
01:31:50,048 --> 01:31:52,849
watch the way we speak in terms of making requests of them.

1316
01:31:53,069 --> 01:31:58,031
And a suggestion or a request, I think, rather than a demand, would be something that would be a little bit more beneficial.

1317
01:31:58,731 --> 01:32:05,434
So as such, I want to thank both of my colleagues on the council for sharing their insight and input, because it certainly had an effect on the way I'll be supporting this paper.

1318
01:32:05,914 --> 01:32:06,234
Thank you.

1319
01:32:06,334 --> 01:32:07,015
Councillor Falco.

1320
01:32:07,335 --> 01:32:08,335
Thank you, Mr. President.

1321
01:32:08,395 --> 01:32:14,998
And I want to thank everyone for their amendments and their concerns and for supporting this.

1322
01:32:15,338 --> 01:32:18,539
But I also wanted to mention as well, because we talked about other boards and commissions,

1323
01:32:19,297 --> 01:32:19,797
and the like.

1324
01:32:19,977 --> 01:32:46,542
And just to mention that, I'm in the process of trying, and I know I've talked to you about this, Mr. President, in the process of trying to schedule the legislative software vendor to come in and basically take a look at what we do with regard to transparency and whatnot, with regard to boards and commissions, because in addition to putting everything online, which actually helps out with transparency, they can also install cameras

1325
01:32:47,919 --> 01:32:59,144
in the console meeting room as well, which would help out with other boards and commissions because you could film all these meetings and they could all be, you know, live and on the cable channel as well.

1326
01:32:59,244 --> 01:33:01,765
So that there is something that I'm working on.

1327
01:33:02,145 --> 01:33:05,847
I think you all make great points with regard to those commissions as well.

1328
01:33:06,427 --> 01:33:12,130
And the minutes, the agendas for those other commissions would all be in line as well using the software.

1329
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:14,571
So I'm hoping to have a vendor come in soon.

1330
01:33:15,211 --> 01:33:16,592
I'm working on scheduling that.

1331
01:33:17,853 --> 01:33:21,594
That actually is from a resolution that everyone supported last year as well.

1332
01:33:22,254 --> 01:33:25,394
So I just wanted to give you an update with that since we're on the topic.

1333
01:33:26,495 --> 01:33:26,775
Thank you.

1334
01:33:26,815 --> 01:33:27,155
Thank you.

1335
01:33:27,855 --> 01:33:28,415
Councilor Nice.

1336
01:33:28,635 --> 01:33:43,377
I do think it's also important to point out, Mr. President, that beginning with the new administration, this council made a request that the majority of board and commission meetings be held off hours during a period of time where individuals in the community can meet to come and attend.

1337
01:33:44,058 --> 01:33:46,198
We were in a situation where a lot of our meetings were happening

1338
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:51,303
12, 1, and 2 o'clock in the afternoon during the week, where members of the general public weren't able to come.

1339
01:33:51,323 --> 01:33:55,947
And the administration did take some affirmative steps to address some of those situations, Mr. President.

1340
01:33:55,967 --> 01:33:58,749
So I thank them for heeding our advice in that regard.

1341
01:33:58,789 --> 01:34:06,836
And I think that if we proceed cautiously and make the request appropriately, I feel as though the administration will be willing to listen.

1342
01:34:07,496 --> 01:34:08,417
Thank you, Councilor Mayne.

1343
01:34:09,758 --> 01:34:12,800
On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Langel-Kern.

1344
01:34:14,422 --> 01:34:15,262
Name and address of the record.

1345
01:34:17,376 --> 01:34:18,757
I live at 281 Park Street.

1346
01:34:19,658 --> 01:34:23,182
I'm glad that we're finally talking about perhaps moving the Board of Appeals meeting.

1347
01:34:23,302 --> 01:34:31,690
Because this council has such a heavy burden of maintaining our zoning ordinances, it's really important that you're able to attend these meetings at some point.

1348
01:34:31,710 --> 01:34:32,671
So a Wednesday meeting

1349
01:34:33,115 --> 01:34:35,897
or perhaps let the board choose a day that works for them.

1350
01:34:36,837 --> 01:34:44,521
The next meeting that will have a large crowd will be the Salem Street development meeting that is already being held on a Wednesday on March 8th.

1351
01:34:45,062 --> 01:34:59,890
Perhaps that would be a wonderful time to test out this room because anyone who's attended any of these ZBA meetings knows that a developer presentation runs in excess of an hour where they show you pictures of everything from shrubs to fitness equipment

1352
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:05,623
to present their entire project from the ground up, and that room is very small.

1353
01:35:06,483 --> 01:35:09,985
Saying that 20 people fit in it is an exaggeration.

1354
01:35:10,025 --> 01:35:11,426
It really doesn't fit that many people.

1355
01:35:11,906 --> 01:35:30,015
So I'd like to see, since this is probably one of the most important boards in the city as far as shaping the city, these meetings be brought out into the public, be televised, or at least be in a room that's large enough for all of us to know, and perhaps if we can get those agendas online so that people know that these meetings are coming up.

1356
01:35:30,548 --> 01:35:31,828
because this is very important.

1357
01:35:32,249 --> 01:35:32,769
Thank you.

1358
01:35:33,489 --> 01:35:33,849
Thank you.

1359
01:35:35,550 --> 01:35:37,351
Roll call vote has been requested.

1360
01:35:37,591 --> 01:35:38,631
Well, Councilor Knight.

1361
01:35:38,791 --> 01:35:44,753
I do believe on the city's website on the community calendar, you can find the agendas of some boards and commissions.

1362
01:35:44,793 --> 01:35:52,196
Some are better than others at posting them, but that information is available on the city website underneath the community calendar link for some, but not necessarily all the boards.

1363
01:35:52,976 --> 01:35:56,898
Mr. Clerk, could you please read the amendments before we vote?

1364
01:36:00,035 --> 01:36:07,317
Yes, we have one amendment that the meeting will move to Wednesday night in the Howard Alton Chambers.

1365
01:36:07,337 --> 01:36:13,139
Meetings will also be televised as well.

1366
01:36:14,659 --> 01:36:24,122
And if there's an overflow, that the boards of commissions take into consideration an alternative.

1367
01:36:24,142 --> 01:36:28,403
They can find alternative places.

1368
01:36:30,426 --> 01:36:33,609
and Councilor Del Rosso to add suggestion.

1369
01:36:36,111 --> 01:36:41,036
On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Alango-Kern, roll call vote has been requested.

1370
01:36:48,042 --> 01:36:52,086
With potential of possibly moving to Wednesday night in this room.

1371
01:36:52,708 --> 01:36:54,489
or looking for other venues.

1372
01:36:54,509 --> 01:36:54,689
Yes.

1373
01:36:54,749 --> 01:36:54,869
Yes.

1374
01:36:54,889 --> 01:36:56,149
Suggestion.

1375
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:57,430
Thank you.

1376
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:57,830
Thank you.

1377
01:36:57,870 --> 01:37:00,271
Roll call has been requested.

1378
01:37:19,715 --> 01:37:20,175
Mr. Clerk, please.

1379
01:37:20,215 --> 01:37:21,556
So where is that going to be inserted?

1380
01:37:46,278 --> 01:37:47,019
Accommodate the crowd.

1381
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:51,260
No.

1382
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,361
Yeah.

1383
01:37:52,781 --> 01:37:53,221
Yes.

1384
01:37:53,541 --> 01:37:57,683
All right.

1385
01:37:57,823 --> 01:38:07,706
So we're going to, we're going to add the word suggestion in there.

1386
01:38:08,867 --> 01:38:11,828
Cause counselor Falco has only asked for the board of appeals.

1387
01:38:14,137 --> 01:38:16,978
That's the only meeting he's requested.

1388
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:17,258
Right.

1389
01:38:17,338 --> 01:38:24,281
If somebody wants to amend it for all, all boards and commissions, then you'd have to.

1390
01:38:24,321 --> 01:38:31,083
We only have one room here, so everybody can't come in this room, so.

1391
01:38:31,123 --> 01:38:33,224
If you want to make it for all boards and commissions.

1392
01:38:33,244 --> 01:38:36,005
We're looking for transparency.

1393
01:38:36,585 --> 01:38:36,705
Yeah.

1394
01:38:36,725 --> 01:38:37,465
Why are we limited to one board?

1395
01:38:37,485 --> 01:38:41,687
So if somebody wants to make an amendment to all boards and commissions,

1396
01:38:48,697 --> 01:38:59,743
Does somebody want to make that amendment?

1397
01:38:59,763 --> 01:39:00,763
Just compromise.

1398
01:39:00,803 --> 01:39:02,824
I just suggest that we compromise.

1399
01:39:02,844 --> 01:39:07,467
You leave the Board of Appeals language in and then also add any and all other boards.

1400
01:39:07,507 --> 01:39:09,808
Any other city boards and commissions.

1401
01:39:10,108 --> 01:39:10,428
All right.

1402
01:39:10,448 --> 01:39:11,109
You got that, Mr. Clark?

1403
01:39:11,129 --> 01:39:11,189
Yes.

1404
01:39:17,712 --> 01:39:19,553
as opposed to zoning, singling out the zoning.

1405
01:39:19,673 --> 01:39:20,193
Yes.

1406
01:39:22,315 --> 01:39:24,656
Mr. Clerk, if you could please.

1407
01:39:25,316 --> 01:39:31,300
Mr. Clerk, if you could call the roll, please.

1408
01:39:35,062 --> 01:39:44,367
I'm only, uh, I'm only using the, uh, amendment to, uh, to include all city boards and commissions.

1409
01:39:45,232 --> 01:39:46,292
including these zoning appeals.

1410
01:39:46,332 --> 01:39:49,633
I'm not changing the language, it's just an amendment to include it.

1411
01:39:50,874 --> 01:39:53,875
Then I think you all should get together and rewrite the whole language then.

1412
01:39:54,295 --> 01:39:56,836
Because... It's just the first sentence, right?

1413
01:39:56,856 --> 01:39:57,656
Just the first sentence.

1414
01:39:57,716 --> 01:40:05,659
Because you already got the... Whereas the Board of Appeals is... You're amended to rewrite the language, so rewrite the whole thing.

1415
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:10,480
We actually need to suggest and add the amendments.

1416
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:12,101
All boards and commissions.

1417
01:40:12,121 --> 01:40:12,721
All boards and commissions.

1418
01:40:13,959 --> 01:40:14,939
All boards and commissions.

1419
01:40:17,541 --> 01:40:18,141
You get that, Mr. Clerk?

1420
01:40:18,161 --> 01:40:19,502
I guess it's the same thing.

1421
01:40:19,982 --> 01:40:20,302
All right.

1422
01:40:21,563 --> 01:40:22,143
You got that, Mr. Clerk?

1423
01:40:22,163 --> 01:40:23,123
All right.

1424
01:40:23,884 --> 01:40:25,904
Counselor Falco has requested a roll call vote.

1425
01:40:27,765 --> 01:40:29,066
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1426
01:40:29,886 --> 01:40:30,807
Counselor DelaRusso?

1427
01:40:30,827 --> 01:40:31,867
Yes.

1428
01:40:31,887 --> 01:40:32,608
Counselor Falco?

1429
01:40:32,748 --> 01:40:32,968
Yes.

1430
01:40:33,568 --> 01:40:34,128
Counselor Knight?

1431
01:40:34,268 --> 01:40:34,648
Yes.

1432
01:40:36,689 --> 01:40:37,490
Counselor Long and Kern?

1433
01:40:37,510 --> 01:40:37,570
Yes.

1434
01:40:38,270 --> 01:40:39,070
Vice President Marks?

1435
01:40:39,211 --> 01:40:39,551
Yes.

1436
01:40:40,991 --> 01:40:41,832
Counselor Scott Pelley?

1437
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,252
Yes.

1438
01:40:42,783 --> 01:40:43,523
President carry on.

1439
01:40:43,643 --> 01:40:43,823
Yes.

1440
01:40:43,903 --> 01:40:44,404
As amended.

1441
01:40:45,064 --> 01:40:51,807
Motion passes seven zero 17 zero six four offered by councilor Falco.

1442
01:40:52,587 --> 01:40:55,768
Be it resolved that the mayor's office contact St.

1443
01:40:55,828 --> 01:41:05,132
Clement's parish to have them contact the various groups to rent the gym, to review the parking protocol in the surrounding neighborhoods.

1444
01:41:05,252 --> 01:41:06,053
Councilor Falco.

1445
01:41:06,313 --> 01:41:07,193
Thank you, Mr. President.

1446
01:41:07,253 --> 01:41:09,514
Uh, this guy also came up, uh, last week during the,

1447
01:41:10,022 --> 01:41:18,069
community police meeting, and I've received one phone call since with regard to, I guess, many of the people, many of the groups that rent the gym at St.

1448
01:41:18,109 --> 01:41:29,979
Clement's, basically when they park, I guess they're blocking driveways and, you know, parking too close to driveways and blocking drivers and whatnot.

1449
01:41:29,999 --> 01:41:31,420
So we could just have St.

1450
01:41:31,461 --> 01:41:34,984
Clement's reach out to the people that rent their gymnasiums and just

1451
01:41:37,068 --> 01:41:40,269
remind them of the parking protocol and just to be considerate to the neighbors in the neighborhood.

1452
01:41:40,829 --> 01:41:41,169
Thank you.

1453
01:41:41,269 --> 01:41:42,649
All in favor.

1454
01:41:43,289 --> 01:41:43,449
Aye.

1455
01:41:43,709 --> 01:41:43,869
Aye.

1456
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:45,010
Motion passes.

1457
01:41:45,710 --> 01:41:47,870
Hands papers in the hands of the clerk.

1458
01:41:50,791 --> 01:41:56,432
You have something in the hands of the clerk.

1459
01:41:56,672 --> 01:41:59,433
Uh, 17 zero six eight offered by president Caravello.

1460
01:41:59,993 --> 01:42:05,594
Be it resolved that the method city council commend and congratulate Richard Dick Fitzpatrick

1461
01:42:06,623 --> 01:42:08,684
on the celebration of his 90th birthday.

1462
01:42:08,744 --> 01:42:13,886
Mr. Fitzpatrick is a member of the greatest generation who fought World War II to make our country safe.

1463
01:42:14,586 --> 01:42:17,327
I was able to attend Mr. Fitzpatrick's party.

1464
01:42:17,407 --> 01:42:19,127
He ended up with a citation.

1465
01:42:21,268 --> 01:42:24,489
Usually when you're 90, the parties aren't too big.

1466
01:42:24,809 --> 01:42:30,211
Mr. Fitzpatrick had about 350 people at his party with the Marine color guard.

1467
01:42:30,251 --> 01:42:33,332
So again, that in itself was a tribute to Mr. Fitzpatrick.

1468
01:42:34,112 --> 01:42:35,513
And again, I want to congratulate him.

1469
01:42:36,582 --> 01:42:38,643
for his service to our country.

1470
01:42:43,704 --> 01:42:44,265
Move approval.

1471
01:42:45,085 --> 01:42:45,545
All in favor?

1472
01:42:46,225 --> 01:42:46,325
Aye.

1473
01:42:48,126 --> 01:42:54,308
We have a couple of sick, we have a couple of death things.

1474
01:42:54,548 --> 01:43:01,990
Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that a moment of silence be held for long-time Methodist resident Joseph Panico on a recent passing.

1475
01:43:02,030 --> 01:43:02,751
And we have another one.

1476
01:43:04,488 --> 01:43:10,073
Offered by counselor carry of yellow, be it resolved that the Memphis city council send its condolences to the family of Dennis Hurley.

1477
01:43:10,493 --> 01:43:17,399
Mr. Mr. Pearl, he is a world war two veteran, uh, and his presence in our community would be, will be missed.

1478
01:43:17,499 --> 01:43:19,862
If we could, uh, counselor marks.

1479
01:43:21,943 --> 01:43:22,944
Thank you, Mr. President.

1480
01:43:23,184 --> 01:43:30,431
Uh, we lost just recently, uh, a long time method resident and anyone that knew Josephine Panico,

1481
01:43:31,663 --> 01:43:35,907
and got to know Josephine, would know she was quite a spunky woman.

1482
01:43:36,867 --> 01:43:40,550
And, you know, you knew where you stood with Josephine at all times.

1483
01:43:41,691 --> 01:43:43,813
And I appreciated her for that.

1484
01:43:44,573 --> 01:43:50,918
And, you know, as a loving grandmother, mother, wife, she is gonna be sorely missed, Mr. President.

1485
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:51,979
Thank you.

1486
01:43:51,999 --> 01:43:53,940
If we could stand for a moment of silence, please.

1487
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,882
Oh, I'm sorry, we have one more.

1488
01:43:57,883 --> 01:43:58,484
You have another condolence?

1489
01:43:58,524 --> 01:43:58,624
Yes.

1490
01:44:08,934 --> 01:44:09,554
I already did that one.

1491
01:44:10,074 --> 01:44:10,474
I did that one.

1492
01:44:11,795 --> 01:44:20,916
If we could stand for a moment of silence, please.

1493
01:44:20,936 --> 01:44:23,857
Motion by Councilor Lang to receive and place on file.

1494
01:44:26,298 --> 01:44:28,658
And I think that is it.

1495
01:44:28,938 --> 01:44:29,718
Thank you, Mr. President.

1496
01:44:31,799 --> 01:44:33,039
The records.

1497
01:44:35,238 --> 01:44:38,401
Records were passed to Vice President Mox.

1498
01:44:38,922 --> 01:44:41,084
Mr. Vice President, how did you find those records?

1499
01:44:41,885 --> 01:44:43,947
Mr. President, I didn't have a chance to review the records.

1500
01:44:44,248 --> 01:44:45,569
Can I lay them on the table for one week?

1501
01:44:46,490 --> 01:44:48,011
We will table those till next week.

1502
01:44:49,353 --> 01:44:54,298
I would ask everyone, if it's wet outside, to please be careful when you're leaving so no one falls down.

1503
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:57,822
Motion by Councilor Hay to adjourn the meeting.
