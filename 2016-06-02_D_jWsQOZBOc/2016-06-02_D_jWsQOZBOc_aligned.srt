1
00:00:10,392 --> 00:00:13,375
Can you find the giant logs we got from the trees?

2
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:15,416
Are they over there?

3
00:00:15,636 --> 00:00:16,557
No!

4
00:00:16,577 --> 00:00:18,138
Are they up there?

5
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:18,959
No!

6
00:00:20,752 --> 00:00:21,632
Where are they?

7
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:23,414
Right behind you!

8
00:00:23,694 --> 00:00:25,335
There they are!

9
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:25,896
Vamanos!

10
00:00:26,216 --> 00:00:27,757
Can you find the Spanish teacher?

11
00:00:28,197 --> 00:00:29,238
Is she over there?

12
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:30,800
Or is she over there?

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,281
Or where did she go?

14
00:00:33,963 --> 00:00:35,084
Here I am!

15
00:00:35,124 --> 00:00:35,604
Cha cha cha!

16
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:37,405
Do you find the cafeteria?

17
00:00:37,885 --> 00:00:38,786
Is it over there?

18
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:40,147
Is it over there?

19
00:00:40,647 --> 00:00:41,668
I need my map!

20
00:00:42,488 --> 00:00:43,129
I'm the map!

21
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:44,209
I'm the map!

22
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:45,470
I'm the map!

23
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,211
It's over there!

24
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:48,332
Hola!

25
00:00:49,192 --> 00:00:50,093
Swiper!

26
00:00:50,213 --> 00:00:51,173
Swiper?

27
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:51,834
Where?

28
00:00:51,994 --> 00:00:52,934
He's over there!

29
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:53,735
Over there?

30
00:00:54,175 --> 00:00:55,256
No, behind you!

31
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:57,817
Swiper, no swiping!

32
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:58,718
Aw man!

33
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:06,716
We came to the end of our journey, and we found the last Muslim report.

34
00:01:35,852 --> 00:01:39,334
The answer to last week's Mustang report question of the week is 8.

35
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:51,662
Hey, so the last question of the week for the 2015-2016 school year is how many students are graduating in the class of 2016?

36
00:01:51,702 --> 00:01:53,963
Tune in next year to find out.

37
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:07,785
Hi, I'm Lydia Ryan and I'm here with Mr. Skorka and he's here today to explain what's going on at the MHS library today.

38
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:09,413
Lydia, hi.

39
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:10,453
So this is wonderful.

40
00:02:10,493 --> 00:02:12,254
This is called the Bloomberg Fair.

41
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:29,157
All of the groups that are here are somehow connected with Bloomberg or the Bloomberg funds that were given to either run different programs and clubs or activities, or just sponsored by the Bloomberg Center.

42
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:32,577
Hi, I'm Lydia Ryan, and I'm here with Ramon, a senior here at Medford High School.

43
00:02:32,597 --> 00:02:35,398
And he's here to tell us today about what he's doing for CCSR.

44
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:41,494
So my project was about financial literacy and how we can implement that into the high school curriculum.

45
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:45,156
So basically I came up with a bunch of resources that teachers can use.

46
00:02:45,736 --> 00:02:53,500
It goes through how they can implement financial literacy in their math classes and their history classes, and it goes from high school to middle school.

47
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,823
Basically this docent program, we'd go to the Museum of Fine Arts and students would pick pieces that they do.

48
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:09,434
and they presented to students that went on this field trip and basically that's it.

49
00:03:10,014 --> 00:03:16,618
Hi, I'm Lydia Ryan and I'm here with Katie Russo, Alana Landano, and Jazlyn Merida and they're here to talk to us about what they're going to be doing today.

50
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,153
We started off with the buddy benches, me and Alana here.

51
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:32,318
And they're basically like a way to find a friend outside at the playground or something.

52
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:37,501
Just if you want to sit down, hang out with someone, maybe find some new friends if you really want to.

53
00:03:37,522 --> 00:03:49,110
So I just want to say a quick thank you to the media department and to Medford High School for giving me an amazing four years here, for teaching me so much.

54
00:03:49,591 --> 00:03:52,794
and for just giving me laughs and a bunch of joy every single day coming in here.

55
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:57,197
Next year, I will be pursuing my studies at UMass Boston.

56
00:03:57,217 --> 00:03:59,559
I'll be studying exercise science and kinesiology.

57
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,761
And I'll be playing soccer and softball there.

58
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:03,542
So good luck to everyone else in the class of 2016.

59
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:07,085
I just want to say thank you to the media tech department.

60
00:04:07,245 --> 00:04:10,568
I'm going to Rhode Island College for a bio on the pre-med track.

61
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:13,831
And congrats and good luck to the class of 2016.

62
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:17,194
Thank you to Medford Eye and the Mustang Report.

63
00:04:17,234 --> 00:04:18,915
Next year, I'll be attending LaSalle College.

64
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:21,318
pursuing athletic training or exercise arts.

65
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:24,919
I want to thank everyone at Medford High and the media tech department.

66
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:27,620
I'm going to Regis College next year.

67
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,980
I'm going to be studying nursing.

68
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,321
And I want to wish the class of 2016 good luck in the future.

69
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:37,062
Thank you to MHS and the Mustang report for a great four years.

70
00:04:37,082 --> 00:04:39,022
Good luck to the class of 2016.

71
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:40,083
I'll be going to St.

72
00:04:40,143 --> 00:04:41,063
Anselm College next year.

73
00:04:42,106 --> 00:04:56,732
I want to thank Medford High School and the Mustang Report for everything that we've been able to accomplish this year, for all the community outreach that we've gotten and all the pretty much like applause and appraisal that we've gotten for the Mustang Report and the popularity that it's gained.

74
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:58,393
Also to thank Mr. Dempsey, Ms.

75
00:04:58,413 --> 00:05:04,756
Goldsberry, Mr. Tirada, Mr. Tucci, and Dr. Perlock for making this happen and being great advisors.

76
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:09,098
Next year I'm going to Emerson College to pursue my career in film studies.

77
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:11,979
which kind of makes sense, but good luck to the class of 2016.

78
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:21,446
I'm Victoria, the editor of the Mustang Report, here with Dr. Pella, the headmaster of the school, to say thank you to the Mustang Report and Medford High for the past year.

79
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:24,548
I thought this past year was phenomenal.

80
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:32,753
It was so exciting to see the Mustang Report on a weekly basis, all the great things going on, and I'd like to let you know I'm very proud of the work you did.

81
00:05:57,205 --> 00:05:57,769
Forever.
