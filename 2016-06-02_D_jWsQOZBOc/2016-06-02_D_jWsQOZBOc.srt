[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, so the last question of the week for the 2015-2016 school year is how many students are graduating in the class of 2016?

00:01:51,702 --> 00:01:53,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Tune in next year to find out.

37
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:07,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Lydia Ryan and I'm here with Mr. Skorka and he's here today to explain what's going on at the MHS library today.

38
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:09,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Lydia, hi.

39
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:10,453
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is wonderful.

40
00:02:10,493 --> 00:02:12,254
[SPEAKER_01]: This is called the Bloomberg Fair.

41
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:29,157
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the groups that are here are somehow connected with Bloomberg or the Bloomberg funds that were given to either run different programs and clubs or activities, or just sponsored by the Bloomberg Center.

42
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:32,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Lydia Ryan, and I'm here with Ramon, a senior here at Medford High School.

43
00:02:32,597 --> 00:02:35,398
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's here to tell us today about what he's doing for CCSR.

44
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:41,494
[SPEAKER_04]: So my project was about financial literacy and how we can implement that into the high school curriculum.

45
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:45,156
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically I came up with a bunch of resources that teachers can use.

46
00:02:45,736 --> 00:02:53,500
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes through how they can implement financial literacy in their math classes and their history classes, and it goes from high school to middle school.

47
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically this docent program, we'd go to the Museum of Fine Arts and students would pick pieces that they do.

48
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:09,434
[SPEAKER_05]: and they presented to students that went on this field trip and basically that's it.

49
00:03:10,014 --> 00:03:16,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Lydia Ryan and I'm here with Katie Russo, Alana Landano, and Jazlyn Merida and they're here to talk to us about what they're going to be doing today.

50
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,153
[SPEAKER_07]: We started off with the buddy benches, me and Alana here.

51
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:32,318
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're basically like a way to find a friend outside at the playground or something.

52
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:37,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Just if you want to sit down, hang out with someone, maybe find some new friends if you really want to.

53
00:03:37,522 --> 00:03:49,110
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to say a quick thank you to the media department and to Medford High School for giving me an amazing four years here, for teaching me so much.

54
00:03:49,591 --> 00:03:52,794
