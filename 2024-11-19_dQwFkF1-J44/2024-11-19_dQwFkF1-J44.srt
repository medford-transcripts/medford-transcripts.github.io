00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:27,930
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you could just give us a brief overview, Mr. Martin, so we can, and we see all your paperwork is in order, but do you want to just give a little few sentences of what this is to explain to the rest of the council what we're doing?

61
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:30,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

62
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:33,572
[SPEAKER_13]: As you know, Post 45 is

63
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:42,268
[SPEAKER_13]: has been there since 1919, and it's a community-based veterans organization.

64
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:58,171
[SPEAKER_13]: And what we want to do now, in keeping with the times, is be able to serve a minimal amount of food to our members.

65
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:05,232
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've worked very hard to bring the place up to compliance.

66
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:13,860
[SPEAKER_13]: It has passed and we feel that this will help the morale of some of our veterans.

67
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:18,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Most of them are the average age now is about 70 years old.

68
00:06:18,884 --> 00:06:21,807
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't get out very much and we do bring them in.

69
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:31,075
[SPEAKER_13]: And we want to make it comfortable for them and so they can enjoy themselves and have a hot dog or something of that nature.

70
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:36,867
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great, so thank you, Mr. Martin.

71
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:42,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I've put in the American Legion post.

72
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:53,220
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate everything you've done for our country and all the members, and I see that you've done everything that's required through our licensing department, so I move forward for approval.

73
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:55,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

74
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:56,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Second, Mr. President.

75
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:57,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

76
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,587
[SPEAKER_06]: In the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Caraviello.

77
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,030
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Knight.

78
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,411
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

79
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:11,872
[SPEAKER_42]: This is a very important paper to the membership of American Legion Post 45.

80
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:16,834
[SPEAKER_42]: And in full disclosure, I've been a Sal in the past, a son of the American Legion member there.

81
00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:21,276
[SPEAKER_42]: And what this paper does is it allows them to operate underneath the governor's guidelines.

82
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:24,597
[SPEAKER_42]: The post has been shut down now since about St.

83
00:07:24,637 --> 00:07:25,097
[SPEAKER_42]: Patrick's Day.

84
00:07:25,657 --> 00:07:28,218
[SPEAKER_42]: And they haven't had the ability to generate any income whatsoever.

85
00:07:28,838 --> 00:07:36,303
[SPEAKER_42]: And that coupled with the fact that this veteran's organization does provide great support services for young and old veterans here in the community of Medford and beyond.

86
00:07:37,004 --> 00:07:44,949
[SPEAKER_42]: That coupled with the fact that the American Legion Post 45 and its membership are always the first ones to step up when the city of Medford needs something, Mr. President.

87
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:47,430
[SPEAKER_42]: If you look to election day on September 1st.

88
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:58,094
[SPEAKER_42]: When the Lawrence Memorial Hospital was unable to host us for our election proceedings, the first people to step up to the plate were Richard Mott and Bobby Miller in American Legion Post 45.

89
00:07:58,814 --> 00:08:03,875
[SPEAKER_42]: And when we celebrate our Memorial Day ceremonies, Mr. President, and we all go down to

90
00:08:06,016 --> 00:08:15,211
[SPEAKER_42]: Oak Grove Cemetery and we sit there and we listen to the beautiful presentations put on by our veterans organizations and as we sit there we see those flags all across the cemetery.

91
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:18,897
[SPEAKER_42]: American Legion Post 45 is the group that coordinates.

92
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:21,975
[SPEAKER_42]: The placing of those flags on our veterans' grave markers.

93
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:29,460
[SPEAKER_42]: So it's very important, Mr. President, that we recognize the work and the partnership that the American Legion has provided the citizens and the residents in the city of Medford.

94
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:38,486
[SPEAKER_42]: And I think it's very important for us to adopt and embrace this opportunity for them to get a common victuals license so that they have the opportunity to reopen and generate some revenues.

95
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:45,571
[SPEAKER_42]: And also allow the membership, the opportunity to come back in and to continue their mutual support relationship that they have.

96
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:53,454
[SPEAKER_42]: When we look at the agenda later on this evening, we have a paper talking about substance abuse and addiction recovery services and the ability to have meetings.

97
00:08:54,154 --> 00:09:04,897
[SPEAKER_42]: And veterans organizations, although they don't necessarily hold meetings per se, are a great spot for veterans to congregate, to get together, and to talk about their shared mutual experiences and how to go through some of the struggles that they're having.

98
00:09:05,438 --> 00:09:10,659
[SPEAKER_42]: So with that being said, Mr. President, this is a paper that I support wholeheartedly, and I'd ask my council colleagues to also join me in supporting it.

99
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

100
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:15,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

101
00:09:16,054 --> 00:09:17,055
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Mr. President.

102
00:09:17,195 --> 00:09:20,699
[SPEAKER_38]: I, too, want to reiterate my support for Post 45.

103
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:29,466
[SPEAKER_38]: They've been longstanding members of this community, very active and involved in this community, and good neighbors for many, many years.

104
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:37,714
[SPEAKER_38]: And I stand here tonight, Mr. President, to support them as they've supported members of this community for the last several decades, Mr. President.

105
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:38,054
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

106
00:09:38,274 --> 00:09:39,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

107
00:09:41,517 --> 00:09:41,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody else?

108
00:09:43,063 --> 00:09:49,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, Chairperson of Licensing, seconded by Vice President Caraviello.

[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, no, we can't hear you.

00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:33,682
[SPEAKER_06]: One minute.

142
00:11:34,523 --> 00:11:38,647
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, I can hear Heather.

143
00:11:39,328 --> 00:11:41,590
[SPEAKER_28]: So it might be the same technical issue we had a minute ago.

144
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:42,731
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

145
00:11:43,532 --> 00:11:44,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Heather, can you try again?

146
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:03,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I apologize, we're having some technical difficulties, so we'll just need a minute.

147
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:09,627
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, Mr. President.

148
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:10,868
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

149
00:12:10,928 --> 00:12:11,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just.

150
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:13,830
[SPEAKER_06]: No, she's not muted.

151
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:30,513
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President?

152
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:31,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

153
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:35,356
[SPEAKER_29]: I can hear Heather, but apparently you can't.

154
00:12:35,516 --> 00:12:36,157
[SPEAKER_06]: You cannot.

155
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:37,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just see.

156
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Jackie Peeks, can you, can you?

157
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

158
00:12:43,803 --> 00:12:45,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, can you repeat the question?

159
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm having feedback there.

160
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:47,766
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there was no question.

161
00:12:47,786 --> 00:12:49,708
[SPEAKER_06]: We just, we just wanted to know if we could hear you.

162
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:51,609
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're just testing.

163
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

164
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:54,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

165
00:12:54,832 --> 00:12:55,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

166
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:03,535
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay, why don't we try that?

167
00:13:03,895 --> 00:13:11,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Heather, if you wouldn't mind, and I apologize for the inconvenience, could you just try hanging up and coming back into the call?

168
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

169
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:21,322
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion to table, Mr. President.

170
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Can the motion of councilor marks the table seconded by?

171
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:24,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

172
00:13:26,101 --> 00:13:28,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

173
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:32,465
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears?

174
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:32,925
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

175
00:13:33,885 --> 00:13:34,806
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello?

176
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:35,246
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

177
00:13:36,027 --> 00:13:36,547
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight?

178
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:36,907
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

179
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:38,408
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks?

180
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:38,768
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

181
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:40,409
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell?

182
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:40,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

183
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,470
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli?

184
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:42,770
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

185
00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:44,311
[SPEAKER_29]: President Falco?

186
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:44,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

187
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:47,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Sending the affirmative, sending the negative, the motion is tabled.

188
00:13:48,674 --> 00:13:50,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we have, so Heather's up there for two.

189
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:52,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we have Neil Parris.

190
00:13:52,516 --> 00:13:54,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Neil Parris with us, Clerk Hurtubise?

191
00:13:55,535 --> 00:14:00,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Mr. President.

192
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:01,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

193
00:14:01,418 --> 00:14:01,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

194
00:14:01,578 --> 00:14:06,221
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-564, petition to reverse signed and ayed by Neil Paris for RIVS Juice Bar.

195
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:09,722
[SPEAKER_06]: 56, station landing, Bedford, Massachusetts.

196
00:14:09,823 --> 00:14:13,825
[SPEAKER_06]: OCD application three exceeds maximum projection.

197
00:14:16,826 --> 00:14:18,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so Neil Paris.

198
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:42,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Clark, do you see him?

199
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:45,656
[SPEAKER_29]: He's on and he's unmuted, Mr. President.

200
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:46,177
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

201
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:48,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you hear me?

202
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:48,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

203
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:50,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

204
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:54,145
[SPEAKER_15]: Neal Powers, Two Foley Farm Road, Wilmington, Massachusetts.

205
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:54,405
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

206
00:14:54,885 --> 00:14:55,246
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

207
00:14:56,727 --> 00:15:00,551
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see, your sign was denied, if I'm correct?

208
00:15:02,453 --> 00:15:05,876
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I believe it's two inches past

209
00:15:08,164 --> 00:15:16,190
[SPEAKER_15]: and my designer had done that pretty much to stay with the other signs that were in station landing.

210
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:21,054
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess they all ended up petitioning for the same type of variance.

211
00:15:21,695 --> 00:15:24,277
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it's kind of keeping with the same look.

212
00:15:24,577 --> 00:15:29,421
[SPEAKER_15]: We had applied for 32 inches depth compared to 30 inches.

213
00:15:30,322 --> 00:15:32,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

214
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:34,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions from the council?

215
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:36,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President.

216
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:38,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Caraviello.

217
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:39,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

218
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:52,803
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like there are only a few inches over the allowed sided, so I don't see a problem with that.

219
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:57,744
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I motion for approval.

220
00:15:57,764 --> 00:16:01,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the motion of Vice President Caraviello, seconded by- Second.

221
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:03,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Council Bears.

222
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:05,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

223
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:12,239
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, at the end of our packet, there's a letter by Mr. Paris, and I think it's a very good explanation of what's going on.

224
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:21,931
[SPEAKER_42]: Dear members of the city council, regarding our sign request for Liv's Juice and a Kai bar located at 56 Stations Landing, my understanding is that we're allowed two feet of projection.

225
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:30,695
[SPEAKER_42]: Since our 24 inch sign is circular, the total square foot is just 3.16 square feet, as opposed to the total four square foot sign that's allowed by the ordinance.

226
00:16:31,155 --> 00:16:33,756
[SPEAKER_42]: The mounting of the sign is flush to the building and would look very funny.

227
00:16:33,776 --> 00:16:40,778
[SPEAKER_42]: And as a result, we're asking for four additional inches of projection for the standoffs to make it fit within the neighborhood and uphold the great look there.

228
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:47,221
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, I personally find a circular sign more aesthetically pleasing than a big square or rectangular sign sticking off the side of a building.

229
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:58,625
[SPEAKER_42]: I think Mr. Paris has given us a great explanation, and although it doesn't present a significant hardship, it certainly does present some curb appeal issues that this council has discussed in the past, and I support this paper wholeheartedly.

230
00:16:59,306 --> 00:17:00,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

231
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:03,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli.

232
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:06,969
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can, is this line, I'm not seeing if it's illuminated.

233
00:17:09,704 --> 00:17:10,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Parris?

234
00:17:10,244 --> 00:17:13,905
[SPEAKER_15]: It is internally lit, yes, that's correct.

235
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:15,405
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

236
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:17,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Parris.

237
00:17:18,446 --> 00:17:19,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions from the council?

238
00:17:21,946 --> 00:17:24,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion of Vice President Caraviello.

239
00:17:27,007 --> 00:17:29,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by, Clerk, would you give him a second?

240
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:34,429
[SPEAKER_34]: It was Councilor Morell.

241
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:35,269
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Councilor Morell?

242
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:35,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'm sorry.

243
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:42,435
[SPEAKER_34]: I thought Councilor Bears had the second, but we said it at the same time.

244
00:17:42,776 --> 00:17:44,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so Councilor Morell.

245
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, we have Councilor Marks.

246
00:17:46,438 --> 00:17:47,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Morell.

247
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:55,285
[SPEAKER_38]: Mr. President, does the owner of the property have plans to turn the sign off after hours?

248
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,588
[SPEAKER_38]: Mr. Parris, can you comment on that?

249
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:02,054
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, did you say the owner of the building?

250
00:18:02,074 --> 00:18:07,575
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe ours is separate.

251
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:09,776
[SPEAKER_15]: But we can program however need be.

252
00:18:09,836 --> 00:18:16,238
[SPEAKER_15]: So whether it's for during business hours or from dusk till dawn, whatever we need to, we can program it.

253
00:18:17,758 --> 00:18:25,621
[SPEAKER_38]: I would state, Mr. President, to be consistent, and I've voted like this in the past, that the sign be turned off when the business is not in operation.

254
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:34,496
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, are you writing that as an amendment to the- I would like to hear what my other council colleagues would like to say on that, and I would have that as an amendment, Mr. President.

255
00:18:35,217 --> 00:18:38,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so that is an amendment by Councilor Marks?

256
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,801
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll get some, would any of the councils like to comment on that?

257
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:43,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears?

258
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:45,251
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Mr. President.

259
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:52,434
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm fine with that, as long as it's within the control of the business, as long as the property owner isn't the one who controls the light switch.

260
00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:55,535
[SPEAKER_34]: We're just having a little bit of feedback.

261
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:59,916
[SPEAKER_34]: I think there were too many mics turned on, so that's directed to you, Mr. President.

262
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:01,457
[SPEAKER_34]: I think we're fine now.

263
00:19:01,497 --> 00:19:02,317
[SPEAKER_34]: It looks like they're off.

264
00:19:02,897 --> 00:19:03,378
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, we're fine.

265
00:19:03,698 --> 00:19:04,258
[SPEAKER_34]: Great, thank you.

266
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:05,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

267
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,773
[SPEAKER_42]: I know our ordinance speaks to the signs not being illuminated after 10 p.m.

268
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,954
[SPEAKER_42]: Anyhow, what are the hours of the gentleman's operations?

269
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:19,598
[SPEAKER_15]: We actually have two sets of hours.

270
00:19:19,918 --> 00:19:23,621
[SPEAKER_15]: Our fall hours just went into effect where we're actually closing at 4 p.m.

271
00:19:24,482 --> 00:19:27,985
[SPEAKER_15]: But our summer hours, we close at 6 p.m.

272
00:19:28,785 --> 00:19:36,591
[SPEAKER_15]: But I can tell you that just walking up and down Station Landing at night, I believe that a lot of the businesses

273
00:19:50,485 --> 00:19:53,606
[SPEAKER_38]: So I would ask with consistency, Mr. President, that the light be turned off.

274
00:19:54,187 --> 00:19:55,647
[SPEAKER_38]: If the audience is 10, that's fine.

275
00:19:56,908 --> 00:20:01,170
[SPEAKER_42]: But whatever the practices at stations landing, I mean, I'm not opposed to the measure at all, Councilor.

276
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:16,256
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't want to come across- I just want to be consistent, because I know when station landing came aboard, we spent a lot of time working on the signage to make sure that it was aesthetically pleasing, because there are a number of residents that live in station landing.

277
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:16,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

278
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,437
[SPEAKER_38]: And we have to be mindful of that as well.

279
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:25,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So is the amendment, I just want to be clear, so is the amendment that the sign gets turned off when the rest of the signs at the stations get turned off?

280
00:20:25,661 --> 00:20:31,845
[SPEAKER_38]: I would say that it conforms with the existing sign ordinance, which I believe Councilman Knight is correct, that 10 a.m.

281
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:32,926
[SPEAKER_38]: the sign be turned off.

282
00:20:32,946 --> 00:20:34,507
[SPEAKER_38]: 10 p.m.

283
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:35,188
[SPEAKER_38]: 10 p.m.

284
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:35,828
[SPEAKER_38]: 10 p.m.

285
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

286
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk, do you have the amendment?

287
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,631
[SPEAKER_29]: Working on it, Mr. President.

288
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,595
[SPEAKER_29]: So the amendment is to

289
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:53,371
[SPEAKER_29]: is to shut off the lights in accordance with the existing ordinance and shut the lights off at 10 p.m.

290
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:54,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

291
00:21:02,018 --> 00:21:02,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Clerk Hurtubise.

292
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

293
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight, did you have a comment?

294
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:07,662
[SPEAKER_06]: You're all set?

295
00:21:07,862 --> 00:21:09,323
[SPEAKER_40]: I thank Councilor Marks for raising the issue.

296
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:10,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

297
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:12,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

298
00:21:12,246 --> 00:21:12,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

299
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:15,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, my question was answered.

300
00:21:15,488 --> 00:21:21,771
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that being consistent with the other signs, I think I would agree with my fellow councils.

301
00:21:21,811 --> 00:21:22,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

302
00:21:22,612 --> 00:21:23,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you very much.

303
00:21:23,592 --> 00:21:35,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, with that being said, on the motion of Vice President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Morell, as amended by Councilor Marks.

304
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

305
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:41,007
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears?

306
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:42,008
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

307
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,088
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello?

308
00:21:44,148 --> 00:21:44,228
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:46,509
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight?

310
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:46,589
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

311
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,230
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks?

312
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:49,891
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

00:21:50,991 --> 00:21:51,671
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell?

314
00:21:52,131 --> 00:21:52,412
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

315
00:21:53,632 --> 00:21:54,372
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli?

316
00:21:54,452 --> 00:21:54,532
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

317
00:21:55,893 --> 00:21:56,653
[SPEAKER_29]: President Falco?

318
00:21:56,853 --> 00:21:57,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

319
00:21:57,273 --> 00:21:59,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Setting the affirmative, zeroing the negative, the motion passes.

320
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:04,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, let's check with Heather Dudcoe, see if we can.

321
00:22:05,516 --> 00:22:06,137
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President?

322
00:22:06,317 --> 00:22:06,517
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

323
00:22:07,882 --> 00:22:12,970
[SPEAKER_29]: Mister had a call at 730 she would be back on the zoom meeting at 745.

324
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:13,991
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, no worries.

325
00:22:14,151 --> 00:22:14,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

326
00:22:17,376 --> 00:22:18,057
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll go to 20-565.

327
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:30,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Petition to reverse sign denial by Best Price Signs in printing for Prestige Car Wash.

328
00:22:30,524 --> 00:22:33,146
[SPEAKER_06]: 277 Middlesex Ave, Medford, Massachusetts, OCD.

329
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:38,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Application six, exceeds allowable area of secondary signage.

330
00:22:40,112 --> 00:22:43,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have anyone on the call from Best Practice Signs?

331
00:22:44,516 --> 00:22:45,596
[SPEAKER_06]: We do, right here.

332
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:50,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Gilmour, if we could please have your name and address for the record.

333
00:22:51,823 --> 00:22:53,505
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, my name is Guilmar Silva.

334
00:22:54,245 --> 00:22:57,048
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm at 1034 North Montelli Street in Brock, Ramirez.

335
00:22:58,149 --> 00:23:00,131
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm from the sign company.

336
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:02,153
[SPEAKER_06]: From the sign company, okay.

337
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:05,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you tell us a little bit about your sign?

338
00:23:06,597 --> 00:23:15,345
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, technically, he has the windows, he want to put a yoni on the top of the windows.

339
00:23:16,755 --> 00:23:21,537
[SPEAKER_31]: just to make the place look beautiful, look a little bit better.

340
00:23:21,597 --> 00:23:23,398
[SPEAKER_31]: It's just you don't have any lights.

341
00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:27,280
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm going to only put the logo of the company, the name Free Vacuum.

342
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:28,581
[SPEAKER_31]: That's all.

343
00:23:29,181 --> 00:23:29,701
[SPEAKER_31]: Each only.

344
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:30,542
[SPEAKER_31]: No lights.

345
00:23:32,543 --> 00:23:34,944
[SPEAKER_31]: It's just canvas and aluminum.

346
00:23:35,404 --> 00:23:35,904
[SPEAKER_31]: That's all.

347
00:23:40,307 --> 00:23:42,067
[SPEAKER_31]: That's going to be between each vacuum.

348
00:23:44,514 --> 00:23:48,561
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't know if you guys have the photo I do have over here with me.

349
00:23:48,922 --> 00:23:51,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we do have a photo in a package here.

350
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we have a question from, we have Councilor Knight.

351
00:23:57,066 --> 00:24:03,828
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, Mr. President, again, at the end of this application, there's also a letter dated March 3rd, 2020 from Mr. DeSilva at the time.

352
00:24:03,868 --> 00:24:06,448
[SPEAKER_42]: I guess March 3rd is when he requested his appeal.

353
00:24:07,188 --> 00:24:16,291
[SPEAKER_42]: And it reads, the purpose of these proposed awnings is to provide protection from the environment, enhance the appeal of the car wash, and instruct customers of free vacuum services in an attractive way.

354
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:21,552
[SPEAKER_42]: Despite the weather conditions, customers will be comfortable vacuuming their vehicles under the shade and shelter of the awning.

355
00:24:22,032 --> 00:24:25,874
[SPEAKER_42]: And the awnings are not only to benefit the customer's comfort, but also create a more attractive facade.

356
00:24:26,294 --> 00:24:31,856
[SPEAKER_42]: Finally, the awnings instruct the customers where the free vacuums are located and create a clear space to park.

357
00:24:32,516 --> 00:24:43,740
[SPEAKER_42]: So Mr. President, it seems like they're seeking 13 awnings, one over each vacuum that look like to be canvas awnings that aren't internally illuminated.

358
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:50,643
[SPEAKER_42]: But I do believe that they would have certain public safety benefit instructing

359
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:54,774
[SPEAKER_42]: where the free vacuums are in a location like that.

360
00:24:54,814 --> 00:24:57,696
[SPEAKER_42]: I believe this is the old Randy's Car Wash on Middlesex Ave, if I'm not mistaken.

361
00:24:59,216 --> 00:25:06,399
[SPEAKER_42]: They've always done a pretty good job over there at Randy's, and I don't think that the new operator would be any less successful.

362
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:17,764
[SPEAKER_42]: And I can certainly support a reversal on the sign denial, but is 13 really the number that we want to approve, I guess is the question.

363
00:25:22,255 --> 00:25:24,598
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a comment, we'll hear from some of the councilors.

364
00:25:24,618 --> 00:25:25,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight, thank you.

365
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:28,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, we have Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Marks.

366
00:25:28,483 --> 00:25:29,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

367
00:25:29,684 --> 00:25:30,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

368
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:31,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Falco.

369
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:35,211
[SPEAKER_11]: I know my concern also falls with the number of signs.

370
00:25:37,173 --> 00:25:44,137
[SPEAKER_11]: To have one sign that says free vacuums, I think we can all see, we all know the location, we all see the vacuums.

371
00:25:44,337 --> 00:25:55,424
[SPEAKER_11]: But to have 13 signs, I'm just a little nervous of what would be added after that on those awnings, or what's hung on those awnings and the like.

372
00:25:55,484 --> 00:26:03,008
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to hear what my fellow councilors have to say, but I just think this might be a little excessive.

373
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:04,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

374
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

375
00:26:07,117 --> 00:26:12,618
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Councilor Marks, and then we have Councilor Bears, and then Councilor Caraviello.

376
00:26:13,158 --> 00:26:13,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

377
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:21,721
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I happen to frequent this car wash where I live right up the street.

378
00:26:22,441 --> 00:26:28,723
[SPEAKER_38]: And let me tell you, there's no mistaking that there's free vacuum at that particular car wash.

379
00:26:29,483 --> 00:26:36,366
[SPEAKER_38]: There is banners on the fence, there are signs everywhere saying free car wash.

380
00:26:36,866 --> 00:26:42,689
[SPEAKER_38]: You can't help but drive by, I mean a free vacuum, and notice that there's free vacuuming there.

381
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:55,114
[SPEAKER_38]: I would also state that these particular awnings, according to the letter we received that Councilor Knight just read, state that the awnings come off the building two feet.

382
00:26:56,129 --> 00:27:10,014
[SPEAKER_38]: So to state that this would be comfortable vacuuming their vehicles under the shade and shelter of the awning, I don't know how you create shade and shelter of a two foot awning coming off the side of the building.

383
00:27:10,914 --> 00:27:15,656
[SPEAKER_38]: Because the vacuum is in front of the car, which is a pretty big,

384
00:27:16,956 --> 00:27:22,481
[SPEAKER_38]: piece of equipment, there's no way that provides shelter for anyone that's vacuuming, Mr. President.

385
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:29,228
[SPEAKER_38]: I think the awnings may be a nice addition to the building without signage.

386
00:27:29,868 --> 00:27:42,439
[SPEAKER_38]: So if the gentleman wanted to put 12 awnings and maybe one or two free vacuum, or maybe even three depending on the wish of the council, I would be amendable to that.

387
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:47,847
[SPEAKER_38]: Because I think the building could use, it's just a squared off building.

388
00:27:48,368 --> 00:27:50,912
[SPEAKER_38]: Aesthetically speaking, it's not that pleasing.

389
00:27:51,232 --> 00:27:58,463
[SPEAKER_38]: Maybe these awnings will make it look more pleasing, but to have it on each awning, Mr. President, is overkill.

390
00:27:59,364 --> 00:28:02,225
[SPEAKER_38]: And it doesn't serve the purpose of shade or shelter.

391
00:28:02,886 --> 00:28:22,835
[SPEAKER_38]: And so I would put in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that out of the request for 13 canvas awnings, that we allow 13 awnings, but only three with signage that states free vacuum.

392
00:28:23,756 --> 00:28:24,096
[SPEAKER_40]: Second.

393
00:28:24,516 --> 00:28:26,197
[SPEAKER_40]: I would second that motion, Mr. President.

394
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:32,081
[SPEAKER_40]: For it's often in the form of a I guess it would be a restriction correct counsel, right?

395
00:28:34,522 --> 00:28:52,291
[SPEAKER_06]: The second bike was that Councilor Knight Excuse me So one minute please so we have a motion by Councilor Mark seconded by a council night to allow the 13 awnings But only three with signage am I correct correct.

396
00:28:52,491 --> 00:28:55,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay quick her to be you had that Yes

397
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,831
[SPEAKER_31]: So move Mr. President.

398
00:29:21,713 --> 00:29:22,393
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. President?

399
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:23,313
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, Councilor Marks.

400
00:29:24,474 --> 00:29:35,697
[SPEAKER_38]: Also, if I could, and I realize the banners are probably up temporarily because it doesn't really, other than the banners, there's nothing else that says free vacuum.

401
00:29:36,217 --> 00:29:44,499
[SPEAKER_38]: I would hope as soon as the awnings go up that those temporary banners come off that are on the fence and around the property, Mr. President.

402
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

403
00:29:50,654 --> 00:29:53,115
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a number of other Councilors that want to speak on this.

404
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:56,497
[SPEAKER_06]: We have, let's see, I have up next Councilor Bears.

405
00:29:56,858 --> 00:29:57,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears.

406
00:29:57,978 --> 00:29:58,719
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Mr. President.

407
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:02,261
[SPEAKER_34]: Councilor Marks and the petitioner answered my question, so I'm all set.

408
00:30:02,361 --> 00:30:02,681
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

409
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:02,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

410
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:03,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

411
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:05,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Morell.

412
00:30:06,743 --> 00:30:07,584
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

413
00:30:07,644 --> 00:30:13,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Similarly, I thank Councilor Marks for bringing forward that language because I wholeheartedly agree and support it.

414
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,328
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

415
00:30:15,572 --> 00:30:16,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Council Member.

416
00:30:16,572 --> 00:30:17,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Caraviello.

417
00:30:18,213 --> 00:30:18,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

418
00:30:18,994 --> 00:30:19,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing.

419
00:30:20,434 --> 00:30:27,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll support the signs and to make sure that those banners come down after the awnings are up.

420
00:30:27,878 --> 00:30:34,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, and again, I think three is more than enough to have free vacuums on it.

421
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,862
[SPEAKER_02]: So I support Council Member's motion also.

422
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:39,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

423
00:30:40,983 --> 00:30:41,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

424
00:30:41,844 --> 00:30:42,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Move the question.

425
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,045
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of.

426
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

427
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:49,762
[SPEAKER_29]: Can I interrupt for a second?

428
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:57,784
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm unclear, I got Councilor Marks' original motion to approve the 13 audits, but only allow three with the signage.

429
00:30:58,945 --> 00:31:04,847
[SPEAKER_29]: Does the motion also include that the temporary planners come down when the audits go up, or is that just a request?

430
00:31:06,608 --> 00:31:08,368
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. President, if I could.

431
00:31:08,488 --> 00:31:09,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, let's see.

432
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:12,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks, you're on.

433
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:28,085
[SPEAKER_38]: This may be a question for the building commissioner in his office, but I believe any banners in the city, Mr. President, have to be permitted and approved for businesses.

434
00:31:29,006 --> 00:31:30,767
[SPEAKER_38]: And I believe it's on a temporary basis.

435
00:31:31,107 --> 00:31:36,890
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm not sure if these banners are approved or if they, I don't know.

436
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:42,393
[SPEAKER_38]: But I would ask as part of this paper that they be taken down as soon as the awnings go up.

437
00:31:43,988 --> 00:31:44,869
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more of a request.

438
00:31:45,749 --> 00:31:47,731
[SPEAKER_38]: Right, I'm not sure if he has current approval.

439
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:52,215
[SPEAKER_38]: Maybe the owner of the property can state whether or not he got approval for the bayonets.

440
00:31:53,136 --> 00:31:54,016
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, please.

441
00:31:54,917 --> 00:31:56,839
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm the one who all the signs for him.

444
00:32:05,946 --> 00:32:10,610
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm going to make sure all the bayonets come out soon and install the bayonets.

445
00:32:11,803 --> 00:32:16,166
[SPEAKER_31]: I make the installation and take all the banners out.

446
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:17,767
[SPEAKER_31]: That's good, that's good Mr. President.

00:32:18,108 --> 00:32:19,369

451
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:28,915
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, so we can leave that language in.

452
00:32:28,935 --> 00:32:32,138

453

[SPEAKER_38]: The banners come down as soon as the signage goes up.

454
00:32:36,241 --> 00:32:36,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

455
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:37,141

505
00:34:01,532 --> 00:34:05,955
[SPEAKER_06]: OCD application 2A exceeds allowable number of signs.

506
00:34:06,555 --> 00:34:08,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Heather, if you could please have your name and address for the record.

507
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:09,960
[SPEAKER_35]: Good evening.

508
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,544
[SPEAKER_35]: My name is Heather Dutko, 27 Old Meeting House Road in Auburn, Mass.

509
00:34:16,045 --> 00:34:16,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for joining us.

510
00:34:16,785 --> 00:34:18,586
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could just tell us a little bit about your sign.

511
00:34:19,587 --> 00:34:19,847
[SPEAKER_35]: Sure.

512
00:34:20,468 --> 00:34:26,692
[SPEAKER_35]: This is a hotel being built and we requested to have signage on all four elevations.

513
00:34:28,474 --> 00:34:30,895
[SPEAKER_35]: And two of the elevations were approved.

514
00:34:30,915 --> 00:34:37,300
[SPEAKER_35]: The east side, the east elevation and the south elevation were approved by right and we're asking the council

515
00:34:37,915 --> 00:34:41,158
[SPEAKER_35]: to allow signage on the north and west elevations.

516
00:34:41,819 --> 00:34:45,082
[SPEAKER_35]: You'll see that the next petition is also for this hotel.

517
00:34:46,463 --> 00:34:49,706
[SPEAKER_35]: So the hotel would like to have signage on each elevation.

518
00:34:49,726 --> 00:34:54,010
[SPEAKER_35]: The elevation either faces a parking lot or a street.

519
00:34:54,451 --> 00:35:00,236
[SPEAKER_35]: So they do feel that it would be beneficial to the hotel to have identification on all elevations.

520
00:35:00,797 --> 00:35:03,139
[SPEAKER_35]: The signs are internally illuminated channel letters.

521
00:35:03,972 --> 00:35:11,617
[SPEAKER_35]: And the size proposed on the north elevation is 150 square foot, on the west is 96 square foot.

522
00:35:11,997 --> 00:35:15,860
[SPEAKER_35]: And that's comparable with the signage on the other two elevations that were approved by right.

523
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

524
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:20,262
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a number of questions.

525
00:35:20,302 --> 00:35:21,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello.

526
00:35:21,643 --> 00:35:28,768
[SPEAKER_02]: President, if we could combine papers 562 and 563 together, because they're almost identical papers.

527
00:35:30,816 --> 00:35:38,481
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of Vice President Caraviello to combine papers 20-562 and 20-563.

528
00:35:38,501 --> 00:35:52,710
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-563 is petition to reverse sign denial by Heather Dudco for XSS Hotels, Fairfield Marriott, 85 Station Landing, Medford, Massachusetts, OCD application 2D exceeds allowable number of signs.

529
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:56,973
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Vice President Caraviello to merge those motions, seconded by?

530
00:35:57,493 --> 00:35:57,873
[SPEAKER_18]: Second.

531
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

532
00:36:05,066 --> 00:36:05,266
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

533
00:36:05,286 --> 00:36:05,367
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

534
00:36:05,387 --> 00:36:05,787
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

535
00:36:06,108 --> 00:36:06,348
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

536
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:22,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 70 affirmative, 0 negative, the papers have been merged.

537
00:36:24,264 --> 00:36:26,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello.

538
00:36:27,046 --> 00:36:27,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

539
00:36:27,707 --> 00:36:35,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, these signs seem to be consistent with the other signs in the area at the other hotel.

540
00:36:35,754 --> 00:36:38,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I correct in saying that?

541
00:36:39,918 --> 00:36:40,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

542
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:49,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the hotel should be seen in all the areas, so I would motion for approval, Mr. President.

543
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion of Vice President Caraviello.

544
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:55,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor Morell.

545
00:36:57,543 --> 00:36:59,403
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have Councilor Marks and Councilor Knight.

546
00:37:00,224 --> 00:37:01,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

547
00:37:01,864 --> 00:37:07,006
[SPEAKER_38]: Mr. President, does the petitioner have any plans for a freestanding sign as well?

548
00:37:08,746 --> 00:37:10,207
[SPEAKER_35]: I do not believe so at this point.

549
00:37:19,513 --> 00:37:28,020
[SPEAKER_38]: I'll accept that answer, Mr. President, and if they do come back, I may not be supportive of an additional freestanding sign.

550
00:37:28,381 --> 00:37:30,322
[SPEAKER_38]: So as long as the petitioner knows that.

551
00:37:30,342 --> 00:37:33,485
[SPEAKER_00]: I will make note of that and relay that back to the hotel.

552
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

553
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:39,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

554
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:41,959
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

555
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:45,460
[SPEAKER_42]: It says that these signs would be internally illuminated.

556
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,042
[SPEAKER_42]: Does any of these internally illuminated signs face a residential structure?

557
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:52,803
[SPEAKER_35]: Not that I, no, no.

558
00:37:55,444 --> 00:38:01,347
[SPEAKER_42]: Right, because you got the old margaritas on one side, the other hotel, right?

559
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:05,769
[SPEAKER_42]: So they're not facing any of the, because they're pretty big, 150 foot square feet.

560
00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:06,929
[SPEAKER_42]: All right, sounds good.

561
00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:07,449
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you very much.

562
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:08,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

563
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, any other questions, comments from the council?

564
00:38:14,512 --> 00:38:15,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, seeing and hearing none.

565
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:27,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's see, so on the motion of... One minute, please.

566
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:36,524
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, so the north side of the building, is that what you're saying?

567
00:38:38,105 --> 00:38:39,525
[SPEAKER_34]: I think it's the south elevation.

568
00:38:46,134 --> 00:38:54,058
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, I think it's the one that was approved by Wright faces the building that Margarita's used to be in.

569
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:12,485
[SPEAKER_06]: There seems to be some concern whether or not, I think, is it maybe the north side of the building faces a residential building, if I'm correct.

570
00:39:14,415 --> 00:39:15,396
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take a look right now.

571
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:16,357
[SPEAKER_06]: One minute, please.

572
00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:17,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

573
00:39:17,658 --> 00:39:17,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

574
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:22,582
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President?

575
00:39:22,882 --> 00:39:23,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

576
00:39:23,163 --> 00:39:26,145
[SPEAKER_29]: There is an ebb and torry on the call.

577
00:39:26,205 --> 00:39:27,566
[SPEAKER_29]: Who said he could address this question?

578
00:39:28,147 --> 00:39:30,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

579
00:39:31,129 --> 00:39:32,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you unmute him please?

580
00:39:40,635 --> 00:39:40,795
[SPEAKER_19]: you.

581
00:39:40,815 --> 00:39:40,935
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

582
00:39:40,975 --> 00:39:41,075
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

583
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:57,862
[SPEAKER_19]: Evan Tormey. I work for the developer of the hotel.

584
00:39:58,703 --> 00:40:09,571
[SPEAKER_19]: I also represented the developer on the AC hotel next door, which does have a sign facing north currently more at the elevation of the residential building at 75 Station Landing.

585
00:40:10,332 --> 00:40:20,840
[SPEAKER_19]: This new building will block that sign that is illuminated on 95 Station Landing, the AC hotel, from being visible to the residents of 75 Station Landing.

586
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,543
[SPEAKER_19]: And this new sign is on the 9th floor of this building.

587
00:40:25,663 --> 00:40:31,888
[SPEAKER_19]: The building next door, I believe, is only 6 stories at 75 Station Landing, so it'll be well above.

588
00:40:31,948 --> 00:40:35,912
[SPEAKER_19]: It's more intended to be visible for people traveling south on the Felsway.

589
00:40:35,932 --> 00:40:38,434
[SPEAKER_37]: It does face the building.

590
00:40:38,454 --> 00:40:38,794
[SPEAKER_37]: Maybe 3 stories.

591
00:40:38,814 --> 00:40:41,276
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, it does face the building.

592
00:40:41,436 --> 00:40:47,000
[SPEAKER_37]: And that's your call.

593
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:56,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone, anyone care to comment?

594
00:40:56,732 --> 00:40:58,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Any consuls, any concerns?

595
00:40:58,273 --> 00:40:58,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry?

596
00:40:58,434 --> 00:41:01,335
[SPEAKER_39]: Mr. President, in the past, if I may.

597
00:41:02,576 --> 00:41:02,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

598
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:04,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Consul, one minute, Consul Knight.

599
00:41:06,299 --> 00:41:06,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Consul Knight.

600
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:13,583
[SPEAKER_42]: In the past, Mr. President, when a circumstance like this has arose, what we've done is put a 30, 60, or 90 day review on it.

601
00:41:14,444 --> 00:41:17,686
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't know if that's something we wanna do in this situation or circumstances.

602
00:41:18,206 --> 00:41:20,347
[SPEAKER_42]: I haven't gotten any complaints

603
00:41:21,328 --> 00:41:24,890
[SPEAKER_42]: from anybody regarding the sign at 75 stations landing to date.

604
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:27,992
[SPEAKER_42]: So I don't find it to be a big issue.

605
00:41:28,432 --> 00:41:38,939
[SPEAKER_42]: However, if it does become an issue because of the action of this council, I think that we should absolutely have the ability to give it a review to make sure that we're not disrupting anybody's quality of life that resides in the community.

606
00:41:39,298 --> 00:41:44,683
[SPEAKER_42]: Well, at the same time, still supporting the application of the Fairfield Marriott Hotels.

607
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:49,308
[SPEAKER_42]: We all understand the benefits that having an additional hotel in our community is going to bring to us financially.

608
00:41:49,348 --> 00:41:51,910
[SPEAKER_42]: And historically, they've been a good partner.

609
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:55,214
[SPEAKER_42]: Our other two hotels have been great partners here in the city of Medford.

610
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:56,875
[SPEAKER_42]: So I don't want to, you know.

611
00:42:00,163 --> 00:42:04,485
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't want to claim nefarious intent, but at the same time, I think it's important that we protect the residents.

612
00:42:04,505 --> 00:42:08,287
[SPEAKER_42]: So I would offer a 30 and 60 day review on the paper and move for approval.

613
00:42:09,688 --> 00:42:12,789
[SPEAKER_42]: For the sign only facing 75 stations only.

614
00:42:13,569 --> 00:42:18,352
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Clerk Hurtubise, I'm not sure if you got that amendment by Councilor Knight.

615
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:23,974
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm sorry, I don't know if 75 is the address, but the north facing sign abutting the residential property.

616
00:42:24,474 --> 00:42:26,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have that, Clerk Hurtubise?

617
00:42:26,655 --> 00:42:27,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Working on it, Mr. President.

618
00:42:34,697 --> 00:42:36,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilmarks one minute, please.

619
00:42:36,078 --> 00:42:49,654
[SPEAKER_29]: We have actually council beers and then let me read this back Yes Councilman is offering an amendment requesting a 30 to 60 day review for the north-facing sign that it is a budding resident the residential property.

620
00:42:50,035 --> 00:42:50,335
[SPEAKER_41]: Correct.

621
00:42:50,355 --> 00:42:50,375
[SPEAKER_41]: I

622
00:42:55,925 --> 00:42:58,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so that is an amendment by Councilor Knight.

623
00:42:58,267 --> 00:43:00,068
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Councilor Bears and Councilor Marks.

624
00:43:00,128 --> 00:43:00,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears.

625
00:43:01,228 --> 00:43:02,049
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Mr. President.

626
00:43:02,089 --> 00:43:07,372
[SPEAKER_34]: Through you to the petitioner, will these illuminated signs be shut off at 10 p.m.?

627
00:43:10,634 --> 00:43:10,794
[SPEAKER_35]: Ms.

628
00:43:10,814 --> 00:43:11,435
[SPEAKER_35]: Duggo?

629
00:43:12,616 --> 00:43:14,657
[SPEAKER_35]: Perhaps Evan could address that?

630
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:22,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Evan, are you still on the call?

631
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:25,977
[SPEAKER_19]: He's still on.

632
00:43:26,597 --> 00:43:27,518
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I'm here.

633
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:28,980
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, I was muted.

634
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,464
[SPEAKER_19]: The hotel operates 24 hours a day.

635
00:43:33,504 --> 00:43:35,426
[SPEAKER_19]: We have guests arriving at all hours.

636
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:47,359
[SPEAKER_19]: The AC hotel next door, which we own and operate, was therefore permitted to have the signs illuminated 24 hours a day or from dusk till dawn for the safety of our guests.

637
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:51,682
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not aware of any complaints regarding the illumination of that signage.

638
00:43:51,742 --> 00:43:55,906
[SPEAKER_19]: And we do, as mentioned, have signs on that building facing the residential structures.

639
00:43:56,807 --> 00:43:59,449
[SPEAKER_19]: These are not glaring signs.

640
00:43:59,509 --> 00:44:03,733
[SPEAKER_19]: They are illuminated, but there's no glare coming from them.

641
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:05,214
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

642
00:44:06,235 --> 00:44:07,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

643
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks.

644
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:14,382
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Mr. President.

645
00:44:16,178 --> 00:44:21,222
[SPEAKER_38]: Are they able to control the lumens on the signage itself?

646
00:44:26,766 --> 00:44:28,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Eben, are you able to answer that question?

647
00:44:29,488 --> 00:44:33,751
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I'm not aware of an ability to control the lumens.

648
00:44:34,052 --> 00:44:36,293
[SPEAKER_19]: There's not a dimmer on the signs.

649
00:44:37,774 --> 00:44:38,255
[SPEAKER_19]: They are

650
00:44:40,126 --> 00:44:41,827
[SPEAKER_19]: It's fairly unobtrusive.

651
00:44:41,967 --> 00:44:46,429
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's going to be a similar sign output to what we already have on the AC hotel.

652
00:44:47,029 --> 00:44:56,093
[SPEAKER_19]: And while it's illuminated, it's not something that causes any discomfort to the eyes or irritates neighboring residents that I'm aware of.

653
00:44:56,133 --> 00:44:59,834
[SPEAKER_19]: We've not received any complaints through the city or from any neighbors.

654
00:45:00,074 --> 00:45:01,475
[SPEAKER_38]: Right.

655
00:45:01,855 --> 00:45:03,156
[SPEAKER_38]: So we're all on the same page.

656
00:45:04,716 --> 00:45:05,877
[SPEAKER_38]: If we put a 30 or 60 day review,

657
00:45:08,738 --> 00:45:14,944
[SPEAKER_38]: And after 30 or 60 days, this council sees fit that we received a certain number of complaints.

658
00:45:15,905 --> 00:45:22,231
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm sure the hotel wouldn't want to remove a $50,000, $60,000 sign based on that.

659
00:45:22,751 --> 00:45:29,218
[SPEAKER_38]: So I would ask that as part of this, Mr. President, that they put up a sign that they can control the Lumens.

660
00:45:29,798 --> 00:45:41,282
[SPEAKER_38]: And that way, if there is a concern, we may be able to go back to the owner of the property and state that the brightness is bothering people or whatever it might be, and have some flexibility.

661
00:45:41,862 --> 00:45:45,764
[SPEAKER_38]: And that's the only reason why I bring it up, Mr. President, because once the sign goes up,

662
00:45:46,324 --> 00:45:55,410
[SPEAKER_38]: And if we do vote at a later date to take it down, that would be of great hardship, I'm sure, to the petitioner, and I wouldn't want to put them in that position.

663
00:45:55,470 --> 00:46:04,316
[SPEAKER_38]: So maybe if they can look at a sign that they can control the lumens, we'll be able to address any issues, because that would be my issue, the brightness of the sign.

664
00:46:04,356 --> 00:46:15,924
[SPEAKER_38]: I understand the petitioner saying they're not that bright, but if they're able to get a sign where they can control that one in particular, not all of them, that one in particular I think would be helpful for not only them, but for us as a council.

665
00:46:18,845 --> 00:46:27,986
[SPEAKER_19]: to the sign manufacturer and to that side, knowing that this is a concern of the Council and potentially neighbors.

666
00:46:28,847 --> 00:46:36,688
[SPEAKER_19]: something that we don't typically do, but I'm sure that we can make that accommodation so that we don't have to turn off the sign permanently.

667
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:40,309
[SPEAKER_19]: We'd rather be able to dim it to a level that was acceptable to the neighbors.

668
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:43,687
[SPEAKER_38]: So I'd ask that that be part of the recommendation, Mr. President.

669
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:45,368
[SPEAKER_06]: So why that is an amendment as well?

670
00:46:45,488 --> 00:46:50,751
[SPEAKER_38]: An amendment that the sign contain a dimming aspect on the north, facing the north side.

671
00:46:50,771 --> 00:46:54,694
[SPEAKER_38]: So I'd ask Councilor Knight to amend his motion.

672
00:46:56,195 --> 00:46:56,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

673
00:46:56,515 --> 00:46:58,977
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you have that amendment as well, Clerk Hurtubise?

674
00:47:00,057 --> 00:47:00,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

675
00:47:00,678 --> 00:47:00,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

676
00:47:01,098 --> 00:47:01,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

677
00:47:01,598 --> 00:47:02,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks, thank you very much.

678
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:04,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

679
00:47:05,465 --> 00:47:12,527
[SPEAKER_42]: So Mr. President, just to be clear, this application before us is just for the permit to reverse the sign denial.

680
00:47:12,808 --> 00:47:23,471
[SPEAKER_42]: And any type of relief sought by the applicant relative to hours of operation outside of the ordinance and its 7 AM to 10 PM requirements would have to be sought under a different cover.

681
00:47:24,131 --> 00:47:27,953
[SPEAKER_42]: That's not going to be covered under the aspect of the vote that we're taking this evening.

682
00:47:32,622 --> 00:47:32,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

683
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:36,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

684
00:47:37,486 --> 00:47:41,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I don't see anybody's hand raised.

685
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:42,690
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're good here.

686
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:51,638
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of Vice President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Morell, as amended by Councilor Knight and Councilor Marks.

687
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk, please call the roll.

688
00:47:56,021 --> 00:47:56,642

[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good night.

[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_06]: You too, thanks.

711

00:50:21,546 --> 00:50:23,166
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm looking, I believe Diana Cutty's on.

740
00:50:24,086 --> 00:50:24,606
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, she is.

741
00:50:24,766 --> 00:50:25,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, can you please unmute her?

742
00:50:27,267 --> 00:50:27,747
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm trying.

743
00:50:28,347 --> 00:50:28,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

744
00:50:30,908 --> 00:50:31,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think you almost had it.

745
00:50:39,687 --> 00:50:39,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

746
00:50:39,888 --> 00:50:40,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Craig.

747
00:50:40,028 --> 00:50:40,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, Mr. President.

748
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:41,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me?

749
00:50:42,174 --> 00:50:44,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, can we please have your name and address for the record?

750
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,627
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if you could please give us a brief synopsis of the project.

751
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:48,423
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Diana Cuddy.

752
00:50:48,483 --> 00:50:50,364
[SPEAKER_09]: I live at 21 Judith Lane, Mansfield, Mass.

753
00:50:50,444 --> 00:51:13,748
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm here representing Boston Gas doing business as National Grid, requesting permission to install approximately 650 feet of a new four-inch plastic gas main extension, a small piece of it starting on Williams Street, going into Somerville, which is most of the length of the main extension, and then going up Medford Street to service a new construction at 87 Medford Street.

754
00:51:15,888 --> 00:51:16,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

755
00:51:17,609 --> 00:51:20,331
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see.

756
00:51:20,732 --> 00:51:25,656
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I may, I'm going to just read that this was approved by the chief engineer with the following conditions.

757
00:51:26,397 --> 00:51:30,660
[SPEAKER_06]: The engineering division recommends that the grant of location be approved with the following conditions.

758
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:43,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, the grant of location is limited to the approximately 60 feet of gas main in one service located in Medford that is part of the larger project described in the GOL documents as follows.

759
00:51:43,951 --> 00:51:57,903
[SPEAKER_06]: To install and maintain approximately 650 feet of a new 4-inch plastic main extension from the existing 4-inch plastic main in Williams Street going on to Broadway and to the service location in Medford Street.

760
00:51:58,403 --> 00:52:02,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, before starting work, the contractor shall notify DigSafe.

761
00:52:02,987 --> 00:52:06,169
[SPEAKER_06]: It shall obtain all applicable permits from the engineering division.

762
00:52:06,669 --> 00:52:15,054
[SPEAKER_06]: The project must obtain a street opening permit pursuant to section 74-141 of the city ordinances prior to commencing work.

763
00:52:15,834 --> 00:52:18,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford Street was rebuilt within the last five.

764
00:52:19,602 --> 00:52:26,206
[SPEAKER_06]: years and is restricted from receiving a SOP without direct approval from the Commissioner of Public Works.

765
00:52:27,207 --> 00:52:33,691
[SPEAKER_06]: At a minimum, the SOP application must include a street restoration plan for review and approval.

766
00:52:34,232 --> 00:52:38,535
[SPEAKER_06]: At a minimum, the street restoration plan must include curb-to-curb paving.

767
00:52:39,397 --> 00:52:43,801
[SPEAKER_06]: The SOP application must also include a traffic management plan.

768
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:53,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Number three, no other utility structures, conduits, duct banks, pipes, or any other appearances are adversely impacted.

769
00:52:53,809 --> 00:53:00,594
[SPEAKER_06]: The National Grid shall ensure that all sewer water and drain lines are marked prior to any excavation.

770
00:53:00,935 --> 00:53:05,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Any disturbed concrete sidewalk panels shall be replaced in kind.

771
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:08,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Asphalt must be replaced with asphalt.

772
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:15,642
[SPEAKER_06]: There are multiple broken concrete panels clustered at the vicinity of the point of entry for the gas service.

773
00:53:16,282 --> 00:53:18,862
[SPEAKER_06]: This cluster should be replaced as part of the project.

774
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:28,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Number four, the sidewalk and street restoration shall be done in consultation with the engineering division and per the requirements of the approved street opening permit.

775
00:53:29,525 --> 00:53:35,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Number five, pavement markings including the hatch pattern must be restored.

776
00:53:36,767 --> 00:53:40,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Number six, the project site must be swept daily.

777
00:53:40,569 --> 00:53:44,692
[SPEAKER_06]: It shall be kept free of debris for the duration of the installation.

778
00:53:45,492 --> 00:53:53,537
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are the, basically that was approved and those were the conditions that were put forth by our city engineer.

779
00:53:54,078 --> 00:53:57,200
[SPEAKER_06]: So at this point, I would declare the public hearing open.

780
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,061
[SPEAKER_06]: It opened to those in favor of the project.

781
00:54:00,422 --> 00:54:00,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

782
00:54:00,622 --> 00:54:03,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuddy, if you could just please give your name and address for the record again.

783
00:54:03,904 --> 00:54:05,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe you are in favor, correct?

784
00:54:06,158 --> 00:54:09,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Diana Cuddy, 21 Judy's Lane, Mansfield, Massachusetts.

785
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:09,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

786
00:54:10,341 --> 00:54:13,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Would anyone else at this point in time like to speak in favor of the project?

787
00:54:19,148 --> 00:54:19,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

788
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:21,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see anyone that wants to speak in favor.

789
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:22,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

790
00:54:25,473 --> 00:54:28,495
[SPEAKER_06]: So seeing and hearing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

791
00:54:29,456 --> 00:54:31,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone in opposition of the petition?

792
00:54:31,717 --> 00:54:34,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anyone in opposition of the petition that would like to speak?

793
00:54:44,773 --> 00:54:47,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, seeing and hearing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

794
00:54:51,195 --> 00:54:54,116
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point in time, are there any questions from the council?

795
00:54:54,817 --> 00:54:56,417
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion for approval, Mr. President.

796
00:54:56,617 --> 00:55:00,679
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a motion of Council of Marks to approve, seconded by- Second.

797
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:02,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears.

798
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:03,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

799
00:55:04,425 --> 00:55:12,489
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, through you, I was wondering if the petitioner could tell me on what side of the retaining wall on Broadway is this trench going to be dug?

800
00:55:12,549 --> 00:55:16,451
[SPEAKER_42]: Is it going to be on the northern side of the retaining wall or on the southern side?

801
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:25,316
[SPEAKER_42]: If you're familiar with the area and you're driving up from Winter Hill and Somerville along Broadway, you'll come to the intersection of Medford Street.

802
00:55:26,036 --> 00:55:31,399
[SPEAKER_42]: There at that intersection, by way of history, is Paul Revere Park, which is the smallest park in the United States of America.

803
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:40,605
[SPEAKER_42]: But I digress, Mr. President, as you go past Paul Revere Park, Broadway splits in two, and you can go up Broadway and travel along the Medford border.

804
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:41,826
[SPEAKER_42]: Some of that is Medford.

805
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:46,627
[SPEAKER_42]: Or you can stay on Broadway proper and go straight.

806
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:51,629
[SPEAKER_42]: So I was wondering exactly where this trench was going to be dug, because there is a Broadway in Medford.

807
00:55:52,029 --> 00:56:03,813
[SPEAKER_42]: And it's the roadway that runs parallel to Broadway in Somerville, right where that split is, where it goes up and over the ridge and comes back down and brings you out where the old Salvation Army used to be.

808
00:56:04,413 --> 00:56:05,033
[SPEAKER_42]: right at Winter Hill.

809
00:56:05,313 --> 00:56:08,975
[SPEAKER_42]: So I was wondering if the applicant could tell us where the trench is actually going to be dug.

810
00:56:09,015 --> 00:56:12,976
[SPEAKER_42]: Is it going to be dug on Broadway proper or is it going to be dug on that one-way access road?

811
00:56:15,097 --> 00:56:18,278
[SPEAKER_09]: So included in the application was a plan.

812
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:29,903
[SPEAKER_09]: The existing gas main will tie into the proposed gas main will tie into the existing one on Williams Street, which is closest to, I'm going to say, the northeast side of the street.

813
00:56:30,478 --> 00:56:36,881
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it will travel along Broadway on the northern side, on the Medford, closer to the Medford side.

814
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:41,583
[SPEAKER_42]: So do we know which side of that retaining wall it's going to be on, I guess, is the question.

815
00:56:43,924 --> 00:56:44,645
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

816
00:56:44,665 --> 00:56:45,605
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a retaining wall.

817
00:56:45,745 --> 00:56:47,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see that on the plan.

818
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:54,269
[SPEAKER_42]: Nor do I. So if you're looking at Medford Street at the intersection, you see that little park?

819
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:55,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.

820
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:56,590
[SPEAKER_42]: Right?

821
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:57,891
[SPEAKER_42]: If you go past the little park,

822
00:56:59,462 --> 00:57:01,443
[SPEAKER_42]: There's a line with a little square.

823
00:57:02,764 --> 00:57:07,527
[SPEAKER_42]: And that line with a little square, I think that's a street that comes right through there.

824
00:57:09,168 --> 00:57:13,790
[SPEAKER_42]: So I just don't know what side of the wall that proposed gas main is going to be on.

825
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:18,933
[SPEAKER_42]: Is it going to be on Broadway proper, or is it going to be on the access road?

826
00:57:22,295 --> 00:57:23,756
[SPEAKER_09]: It can go on either one, whatever.

827
00:57:23,776 --> 00:57:26,798
[SPEAKER_40]: I would much rather prefer it to be on Somerville.

828
00:57:28,114 --> 00:57:29,594
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm not in Medford, personally.

829
00:57:31,335 --> 00:57:33,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we try to avoid retaining walls, as you can imagine.

830
00:57:35,016 --> 00:57:42,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Something like this, I didn't see the city engineer make a note of this in his condition, so I'm wondering if maybe this is something we could look into a little bit and have on the permit.

831
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,380
[SPEAKER_42]: My colleagues are following me with what I'm talking about, right?

832
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,180
[SPEAKER_42]: You guys know what I'm saying?

833
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,121
[SPEAKER_34]: I think it's on the other side of the intersection.

834
00:57:56,141 --> 00:57:57,141
[SPEAKER_34]: I might be wrong, too.

835
00:58:03,527 --> 00:58:04,808
[SPEAKER_41]: Dexter Street is Big Bundle.

836
00:58:23,221 --> 00:58:24,482
[SPEAKER_06]: We just need a minute.

837
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:28,665
[SPEAKER_06]: We're taking a look at the diagram.

838
00:58:44,707 --> 00:58:45,668
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm sorry, Mr. President.

839
00:58:46,868 --> 00:58:50,971
[SPEAKER_42]: That's Main Street, the little park, not Medford Street.

840
00:58:52,211 --> 00:58:52,852
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see it.

841
00:58:52,872 --> 00:58:53,992
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking on Google.

842
00:58:54,032 --> 00:58:55,373
[SPEAKER_42]: Main Street and Medford Street split.

843
00:58:55,894 --> 00:59:03,398
[SPEAKER_42]: Main Street goes further to the, I guess it would be east, and Medford Street goes up past those parks.

844
00:59:03,418 --> 00:59:04,138
[SPEAKER_42]: So I was confused.

845
00:59:04,178 --> 00:59:06,460
[SPEAKER_42]: I had, because Dexter Street threw me off, because Dexter's

846
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:12,003
[SPEAKER_42]: Dexter runs through Maine to Medford, so this is further down.

847
00:59:12,103 --> 00:59:17,168
[SPEAKER_42]: Creative Science is on the corner here of Dexter and- You are correct.

848
00:59:17,188 --> 00:59:21,952
[SPEAKER_42]: So this will be going, there is no retaining wall, so this is all going in front of- Trump Field.

849
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:26,616
[SPEAKER_42]: The pizza place, Dacos Tavern, the Chinese food restaurant coming around the corner.

850
00:59:26,716 --> 00:59:28,578
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, yep, I second the motion to approve.

851
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:32,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

852
00:59:35,894 --> 00:59:37,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Were there any other questions regarding this?

853
00:59:40,516 --> 00:59:40,997
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may, Ms.

854
00:59:41,017 --> 00:59:55,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuddy, the engineer mentions in his notes that, let's see, there are multiple broken concrete panels clustered at the vicinity of the point of entry for the gas service.

855
00:59:55,524 --> 00:59:57,765
[SPEAKER_06]: This cluster should be replaced as part of this project.

856
00:59:58,205 --> 01:00:00,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Are those gonna be replaced with concrete?

857
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they will be.

858
01:00:02,667 --> 01:00:03,628
[SPEAKER_06]: They will be, okay.

859
01:00:06,158 --> 01:00:07,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Councilor Knight.

860
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:11,568
[SPEAKER_42]: This is a service call.

861
01:00:11,628 --> 01:00:13,952
[SPEAKER_42]: I know that there's some discussion in here about an SOP.

862
01:00:14,413 --> 01:00:17,719
[SPEAKER_42]: So SOP means that the applicant

863
01:00:18,973 --> 01:00:24,456
[SPEAKER_42]: would provide the city with the funds to then go and perform, no, that's a street opening permit.

864
01:00:24,797 --> 01:00:25,517
[SPEAKER_42]: That's a different program.

865
01:00:25,797 --> 01:00:31,501
[SPEAKER_42]: I guess the question is, is the 60 feet of roadway that's being torn up in Medford going to be replaced curb to curb?

866
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:36,744
[SPEAKER_42]: Where this is creation of new service, we're tearing up a couple of roadways 60 feet.

867
01:00:36,864 --> 01:00:38,725
[SPEAKER_42]: Are we going to be able to get curb to curb restoration?

868
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's part of the engineers.

869
01:00:43,982 --> 01:00:44,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Recommendations.

870
01:00:44,743 --> 01:00:46,425
[SPEAKER_06]: His recommendation is for which

871
01:01:08,294 --> 01:01:10,775
[SPEAKER_09]: the city engineer would make these conditions of the permit.

872
01:01:10,935 --> 01:01:12,456
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're... Correct.

873
01:01:12,476 --> 01:01:13,056
[SPEAKER_06]: That's part of that.

874
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:17,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Point number 2, at a minimum, the street restoration plan must include curb-to-curb paving.

875
01:01:18,818 --> 01:01:21,919
[SPEAKER_06]: The SOP application must also include a traffic management plan.

876
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:22,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

877
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:24,100
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at the top of page 27.

878
01:01:31,704 --> 01:01:32,425
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, I see it there.

879
01:01:32,445 --> 01:01:32,565
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay.

880
01:01:32,585 --> 01:01:33,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

881
01:01:34,066 --> 01:01:34,226
[SPEAKER_41]: Yep.

882

[SPEAKER_06]: The pedestrian ramps at the opposite sides of the crossing must also be replaced and meet ADA requirements.

1026
01:12:35,124 --> 01:12:39,527
[SPEAKER_06]: I, a sidewalk panel adjacent to vault 8 on the west side is cracked.

1027
01:12:39,627 --> 01:12:40,568
[SPEAKER_06]: It must be replaced.

1028
01:12:40,908 --> 01:12:45,591
[SPEAKER_06]: The asphalt patch adjacent to the cracked panel must be replaced with cement concrete sidewalk.

1029
01:12:45,991 --> 01:12:49,474
[SPEAKER_06]: J, vault 6 is located in an existing asphalt patch.

1030
01:12:49,994 --> 01:12:53,116
[SPEAKER_06]: The asphalt must be replaced with cement concrete.

1031
01:12:53,637 --> 01:12:57,839
[SPEAKER_06]: The cement concrete panels adjacent to the location are cracked and must be replaced.

1032
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:02,102
[SPEAKER_06]: K, manhole 2, an associated excavation and conduit

1033
01:13:03,243 --> 01:13:06,644
[SPEAKER_06]: will disturb the existing pedestrian ramp on the west side of Bradley Road.

1034
01:13:07,224 --> 01:13:11,404
[SPEAKER_06]: The main old cover must not be located within a ramp, wings, or level landings.

1035
01:13:11,884 --> 01:13:15,845
[SPEAKER_06]: The new ramp placed as part of the restoration must be ADA compliant.

1036
01:13:16,345 --> 01:13:21,346
[SPEAKER_06]: The pedestrian ramp at the east side of the crossing must be replaced to meet ADA requirements.

1037
01:13:22,266 --> 01:13:28,107
[SPEAKER_06]: L, fault five is located adjacent to an asphalt patch that must be replaced with cement concrete sidewalk.

1038
01:13:28,567 --> 01:13:32,928
[SPEAKER_06]: The sidewalk panels adjacent to this fault are cracked and must be replaced.

1039
01:13:37,356 --> 01:13:39,822
[SPEAKER_06]: M, vault four is located adjacent to the building.

1040
01:13:40,002 --> 01:13:43,450
[SPEAKER_06]: The vault must be relocated to the furniture zone if feasible.

1041
01:13:44,804 --> 01:13:49,527
[SPEAKER_06]: The adjacent asphalt patch must be replaced with cement concrete sidewalk.

1042
01:13:49,808 --> 01:13:53,670
[SPEAKER_06]: And vault three appears to conflict with a city trash barrel.

1043
01:13:53,690 --> 01:14:00,755
[SPEAKER_06]: The vault must be removed or a new trash barrel location coordinated with the DPW.

1044
01:14:00,775 --> 01:14:05,679
[SPEAKER_06]: The adjacent sidewalk panel at the street light in the adjacent panel near the building are cracked.

1045
01:14:06,099 --> 01:14:06,940
[SPEAKER_06]: It must be replaced.

1046
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Vault three must be located in the furniture zone if feasible.

1047
01:14:11,543 --> 01:14:14,967
[SPEAKER_06]: O, vault 2 must be located in the furniture zone if feasible.

1048
01:14:15,508 --> 01:14:20,594
[SPEAKER_06]: P, vault 1 must be located in the furniture zone if feasible.

1049
01:14:20,614 --> 01:14:24,899
[SPEAKER_06]: The adjacent panel in poor condition must be replaced.

1050
01:14:25,019 --> 01:14:29,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Q, the surface conduit for 81 High Street passes under damaged curb.

1051
01:14:30,706 --> 01:14:33,347
[SPEAKER_06]: The damaged curb must not be reused.

1052
01:14:33,787 --> 01:14:40,310
[SPEAKER_06]: A new or good condition used vertical granite curbing that matches the existing curbing must be used for restoration.

1053
01:14:40,831 --> 01:14:48,054
[SPEAKER_06]: The sidewalk panels adjacent to the conduit line are cracked, it's spalling, it must be replaced.

1054
01:14:48,454 --> 01:14:50,535
[SPEAKER_06]: R, all pavement markings must be restored.

1055
01:14:51,095 --> 01:14:57,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Number 14, the project must be swept daily and shall be kept free of debris for the duration of the installation.

1056
01:14:57,658 --> 01:14:57,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Number 15,

1057
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:09,242
[SPEAKER_06]: The service conduit must be encased in concrete or flowable fill unless required by the MWRA at the crossings or authorized by the city engineer.

1058
01:15:09,742 --> 01:15:12,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Flowable fill must be excavatable.

1059
01:15:13,063 --> 01:15:17,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Number 16, the plan indicates the vaults in manholes are heavy duty.

1060
01:15:18,024 --> 01:15:19,905
[SPEAKER_06]: However, there is no indication that this

1061
01:15:20,385 --> 01:15:22,246
[SPEAKER_06]: to the board of health for approval.

1062
01:15:22,266 --> 01:15:24,988
[SPEAKER_06]: This plan must be approved prior to the

1063
01:15:49,926 --> 01:15:53,767
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been approved by the chief engineer and those were the following conditions.

1064
01:15:54,488 --> 01:15:58,989
[SPEAKER_06]: So at this point, I would declare the public hearing open to those in favor of the petition.

1065
01:15:59,009 --> 01:16:05,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, we had a, is there anybody that would like to speak in favor of the petition?

1066
01:16:09,914 --> 01:16:13,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Greg, if you could just give, since you already spoke, can you just give your name and address for the record, please?

1067
01:16:14,508 --> 01:16:18,291
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, thank you very much.

1068
01:16:18,411 --> 01:16:21,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone else, is there anyone else that would like to speak in favor of the petition?

1069
01:16:24,415 --> 01:16:26,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Clerk Hurtubise, I don't see anyone.

1070
01:16:26,096 --> 01:16:31,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, seeing and hearing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

1071
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:34,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone in opposition of the petition?

1072
01:16:34,682 --> 01:16:35,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone in opposition?

1073
01:16:40,166 --> 01:16:40,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1074
01:16:41,827 --> 01:16:43,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise, I don't see anyone in opposition either, so.

1075
01:16:47,461 --> 01:16:49,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing and hearing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

1076
01:16:54,562 --> 01:16:55,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Counsel Knight.

1077
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:57,683
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1078
01:16:58,043 --> 01:17:06,545
[SPEAKER_40]: From my brief calculations, it looks like this application seeks for about a half a mile of a ground opening permit.

1079
01:17:07,385 --> 01:17:08,265
[SPEAKER_40]: Does that sound correct, sir?

1080
01:17:11,106 --> 01:17:11,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Franks.

1081
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:14,212
[SPEAKER_42]: That sounds about right, yes.

1082
01:17:14,452 --> 01:17:15,273
[SPEAKER_42]: 2600 feet or something like that?

1083
01:17:16,094 --> 01:17:16,274
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

1084
01:17:16,795 --> 01:17:26,064
[SPEAKER_42]: And it goes right through our central business district, Mr. President, one that we've been talking about for as long as I can remember in terms of what we're going to do to revitalize it.

1085
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:30,328
[SPEAKER_42]: The lack of commitment to revitalize Medford Square coupled with

1086
01:17:31,994 --> 01:17:44,245
[SPEAKER_42]: the impacts of the Kranich Bridge closure for such an extended period of time, along with the COVID-19 situation that's happened.

1087
01:17:44,725 --> 01:17:53,073
[SPEAKER_42]: We have a number of restaurants and places that provide food services along this stretch, and the impact that they've

1088
01:17:55,561 --> 01:18:03,743
[SPEAKER_42]: The financial impact that they've had to put up with through a variety of different reasons over the course of the last five years is troublesome, Mr. President.

1089
01:18:04,204 --> 01:18:08,445
[SPEAKER_42]: So I guess this is a long way of asking a question, and the question is, how long will this construction take?

1090
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:21,882
[SPEAKER_22]: the construction crew.

1091
01:18:21,962 --> 01:18:29,808
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, once we get in the, once we're able to get in the ground, we can move pretty quickly.

1092
01:18:29,888 --> 01:18:33,410
[SPEAKER_22]: It's, you know, a matter of days, not weeks.

1093
01:18:34,151 --> 01:18:36,272
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, so you think you guys can do 100 feet a day?

1094
01:18:38,294 --> 01:18:39,275
[SPEAKER_42]: More than 100 feet a day?

1095
01:18:39,395 --> 01:18:39,755
[SPEAKER_32]: Easily.

1096
01:18:40,255 --> 01:18:40,595
[SPEAKER_32]: Easily.

1097
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:41,276
[SPEAKER_42]: Easily.

1098
01:18:41,396 --> 01:18:41,636
[SPEAKER_42]: OK.

1099
01:18:42,156 --> 01:18:48,200
[SPEAKER_42]: What are the plans in terms of the storage of equipment and materials during the construction period?

1100
01:18:51,862 --> 01:18:56,025
[SPEAKER_22]: We shouldn't really need to store anything on site.

1101
01:19:00,768 --> 01:19:04,570
[SPEAKER_22]: It might be helpful if you can unmute my colleague, Dave Zuwahling, who's

1102
01:19:06,676 --> 01:19:07,076
[SPEAKER_22]: at 617-279-7864.

1103
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:13,982
[SPEAKER_42]: Is everybody at home getting this in case they have a problem during the construction?

1104
01:19:15,323 --> 01:19:19,346
[SPEAKER_00]: Here he is, OK.

1105
01:19:19,386 --> 01:19:22,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Flewelling, I'm trying to unmute you now.

1106
01:19:22,248 --> 01:19:27,992
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, he should be.

1107
01:19:28,372 --> 01:19:28,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

1108
01:19:29,553 --> 01:19:31,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, if you could please give me a name and address for the record.

1109
01:19:32,655 --> 01:19:35,838
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, James Flewelling, Corncastle, New Enfanceville, Rubin, Mass.

1110
01:19:36,732 --> 01:19:39,393
[SPEAKER_30]: I'd be happy to help answer any questions you have.

1111
01:19:40,533 --> 01:19:40,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

1112
01:19:42,354 --> 01:19:46,335
[SPEAKER_42]: Will the public way be used for the overnight storage of equipment and materials?

1113
01:19:47,755 --> 01:19:47,955
[SPEAKER_42]: No.

1114
01:19:48,775 --> 01:19:49,876
[SPEAKER_42]: Can we put that as a condition?

1115
01:19:54,217 --> 01:19:54,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that a question?

1116
01:19:54,797 --> 01:19:54,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1117
01:19:55,597 --> 01:19:56,257
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, excellent.

1118
01:19:56,517 --> 01:20:02,779
[SPEAKER_42]: So I'd like to offer that in the form of an amendment number 18, Mr. President, as a condition that there'll be no storage of any equipment or materials on the public way.

1119
01:20:02,939 --> 01:20:03,319
[SPEAKER_42]: Second.

1120
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,160
[SPEAKER_42]: With that being said, I rest my case.

1121
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:05,440
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1122
01:20:06,021 --> 01:20:06,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1123
01:20:08,482 --> 01:20:09,923
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Councilor Bears.

1124
01:20:09,943 --> 01:20:10,563
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a question?

1125
01:20:11,384 --> 01:20:11,504
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

1126
01:20:11,524 --> 01:20:12,204
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, Councilor Bears.

1127
01:20:12,264 --> 01:20:16,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I good to go?

1128
01:20:16,386 --> 01:20:16,886
[SPEAKER_34]: You're good to go.

1129
01:20:17,367 --> 01:20:17,767
[SPEAKER_34]: Great.

1130
01:20:17,807 --> 01:20:18,887
[SPEAKER_34]: Do we have the city engineer?

1131
01:20:20,768 --> 01:20:22,769
[SPEAKER_06]: The city engineer I don't think is with us.

1132
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:23,890
[SPEAKER_34]: OK.

1133
01:20:26,311 --> 01:20:31,394
[SPEAKER_34]: I guess then just to the petitioners, when will this construction start?

1134
01:20:32,335 --> 01:20:33,276
[SPEAKER_34]: Is this next spring?

1135
01:20:33,336 --> 01:20:34,957
[SPEAKER_34]: Is it this fall?

1136
01:20:35,898 --> 01:20:38,981
[SPEAKER_22]: We would very much like to get this done before the moratorium.

1137
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:41,863
[SPEAKER_22]: Someone mentioned COVID earlier.

1138
01:20:43,925 --> 01:20:51,951
[SPEAKER_22]: We are getting a lot of calls from the residents and businesses there that they need a modern internet connection in today's world.

1139
01:20:52,512 --> 01:20:54,674
[SPEAKER_22]: So we'd like to get it to them before the winter.

1140
01:20:55,529 --> 01:20:55,789
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay.

1141
01:20:55,949 --> 01:20:56,310
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1142
01:20:56,350 --> 01:21:02,034
[SPEAKER_34]: And I mean, my question for the engineer would be why, why are there 18 now conditions, but he's not here.

1143
01:21:02,134 --> 01:21:03,035
[SPEAKER_34]: So that's okay.

1144
01:21:04,917 --> 01:21:05,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1145
01:21:05,217 --> 01:21:06,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Council appears.

1146
01:21:10,361 --> 01:21:11,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause there'll be, you're all set, right?

1147
01:21:11,502 --> 01:21:12,883
[SPEAKER_43]: Perfect.

1148
01:21:12,943 --> 01:21:13,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice-president Caraviello.

1149
01:21:17,967 --> 01:21:19,308
[SPEAKER_43]: We'll be having happening in the evening.

1150
01:21:19,328 --> 01:21:19,408
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay.

1151
01:21:28,382 --> 01:21:30,684
[SPEAKER_30]: in the evening, I think was the question.

1152
01:21:31,144 --> 01:21:38,928
[SPEAKER_30]: I believe that question would be up to the engineer when we apply for the street opening permit, what the limits of the working hours would be.

1153
01:21:39,609 --> 01:21:49,094
[SPEAKER_30]: It would probably make a lot more sense to do the work at night and less impact to the businesses, and this is a heavily trafficked area.

1154
01:21:49,814 --> 01:21:52,276
[SPEAKER_30]: We do have a traffic plan all prepared and ready to go.

1155
01:21:52,816 --> 01:21:56,841
[SPEAKER_30]: depending upon if the petition and the project is approved.

1156
01:21:57,501 --> 01:22:00,725
[SPEAKER_30]: That's certainly something we can entertain doing the work at night.

1157
01:22:01,326 --> 01:22:04,890
[SPEAKER_30]: We'd probably be able to get more work done at night versus during the day, certainly.

1158
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:13,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President, because like Mayor DeCosta said, this is an area already impacted by other circumstances.

1159
01:22:13,923 --> 01:22:22,405
[SPEAKER_02]: And to take away their parking spots, and some of them have outdoor dining in that area, would be more cumbersome than they already have.

1160
01:22:22,445 --> 01:22:30,928
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you could do this at night, after 10 o'clock, it would be greatly appreciated to all the businesses that are in that area.

1161
01:22:33,024 --> 01:22:40,007
[SPEAKER_30]: We have done work at night on High Street in the past when we did 84 and 92 High Street, so we can certainly do the night work.

1162
01:22:40,587 --> 01:22:40,988
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1163
01:22:42,248 --> 01:22:43,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1164
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:47,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions for the Council?

1165
01:22:50,592 --> 01:22:51,272
[SPEAKER_34]: Motion to approve.

1166
01:22:51,292 --> 01:22:55,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion to approve, motion by Councilor Behr, seconded.

1167
01:22:57,195 --> 01:22:57,675
[SPEAKER_34]: As amended.

1168
01:22:58,823 --> 01:22:59,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, okay.

01:27:13,005 --> 01:27:19,149
[SPEAKER_06]: regarding the proposed local historic district at the Haskell-Cutter House 16 Foster Court, Medford, Massachusetts.

1214
01:27:19,729 --> 01:27:30,236
[SPEAKER_06]: At its meeting on September 16, 2020, the Community Development Board voted to make no recommendation on the proposed local historic district at the Haskell-Cutter House 16 Foster Court, Medford.

1215
01:27:30,856 --> 01:27:37,980
[SPEAKER_06]: but encourages the parties involved to pursue preservation of the historic structure either on this site or another site.

1216
01:27:38,501 --> 01:27:56,152
[SPEAKER_06]: During the robust discussion, board members expressed their desire to work with the Historic District Commission to prioritize conservation properties for future districts, find additional ways of celebrating Medford shipbuilding history, and support a citywide evaluation of the city's historic assets.

1217
01:27:56,792 --> 01:27:58,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the opportunity to review this matter.

1218
01:27:59,233 --> 01:28:06,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Andrew LaRue, Chairman, and the CC was to Breanna Lungo-Koehn mayor, and Kimberly Scanley, the acting city solicitor.

1219
01:28:07,437 --> 01:28:08,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Council appears.

1220
01:28:10,278 --> 01:28:11,098
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1221
01:28:12,919 --> 01:28:14,840
[SPEAKER_34]: I didn't have my hand up yet, but I was going to put it up.

1222
01:28:18,462 --> 01:28:20,183
[SPEAKER_34]: We've had a lot of discussion about this.

1223
01:28:20,263 --> 01:28:21,784
[SPEAKER_34]: We went on a site visit yesterday.

1224
01:28:21,804 --> 01:28:28,027
[SPEAKER_34]: I think the discussion in our committee of the whole Allen site showed us that we are really close here.

1225
01:28:28,047 --> 01:28:31,049
[SPEAKER_34]: I think that the property owner

1226
01:28:31,946 --> 01:28:38,249
[SPEAKER_34]: and the members of the historic commission, the historic district commission are close, and I think we should encourage that compromise.

1227
01:28:38,409 --> 01:28:49,734
[SPEAKER_34]: But I also think that what's before us tonight is the question of whether 16 Foster Court and the 200-year-old structure on the lot warrants a historic district designation, and I think from the evidence we've been shown, it absolutely does.

1228
01:28:50,654 --> 01:28:56,397
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm heartened by the efforts of the property owner to reach compromise, and now, you know,

1229
01:28:57,697 --> 01:29:11,162
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm concerned that if we don't approve the district that the compromise won't be reached and one of the last pieces of the shipbuilding history of our city, which as we know is an important part of our city's history, will be demolished on October 9th.

1230
01:29:12,509 --> 01:29:28,685
[SPEAKER_34]: Now that the community process is underway, and now that it's clear that the developer and the Historical Commission and the Historic District Commission are near to a good faith compromise, I think we should approve the district, ensuring that the community process can continue without the threat of demolition hanging over the discussions and the goal of compromise.

1231
01:29:29,551 --> 01:29:34,755
[SPEAKER_34]: I think 16 Foster Court clearly deserves the historic designation, regardless of the compromise.

1232
01:29:35,335 --> 01:29:43,061
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm hopeful that it will keep the facade of the building and that we can really celebrate the shipbuilding history of the city of Medford.

1233
01:29:44,222 --> 01:29:51,047
[SPEAKER_34]: But that designation certainly would not preclude moving forward with development, and I think all parties involved are ready to have that discussion.

1234
01:29:51,167 --> 01:29:56,991
[SPEAKER_34]: So I think we should advance this, but I welcome hearing from my other Councilors.

1235
01:29:57,292 --> 01:29:57,592
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1236
01:29:58,660 --> 01:29:58,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1237
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you console beers.

1238
01:30:00,201 --> 01:30:01,942
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you were saying are you advancing it?

1239
01:30:01,962 --> 01:30:03,664
[SPEAKER_34]: Are you not making a motion?

1240
01:30:03,684 --> 01:30:03,924
[SPEAKER_34]: Nope.

1241
01:30:04,104 --> 01:30:10,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so make sure Let's see there is there any any other consoles that like to speak on this matter?

1242
01:30:14,531 --> 01:30:18,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm just constantly I Didn't see a button press.

1243
01:30:18,854 --> 01:30:22,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just uh, oh, you know, it's the screens different.

1244
01:30:22,057 --> 01:30:22,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1245
01:30:22,437 --> 01:30:22,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I

1246
01:30:23,575 --> 01:30:25,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight, and then Councilor Caraviello.

1247
01:30:25,417 --> 01:30:26,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

1248
01:30:26,459 --> 01:30:28,822
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, I personally couldn't agree with Councilor Bears more.

1249
01:30:28,842 --> 01:30:33,929
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm very glad to see the property owner and the historic commission sitting down trying to make compromise.

1250
01:30:34,449 --> 01:30:37,734
[SPEAKER_42]: We have ample opportunity and time to still address this matter.

1251
01:30:39,416 --> 01:30:41,817
[SPEAKER_42]: We have another meeting before the deadline.

1252
01:30:42,598 --> 01:30:48,682
[SPEAKER_42]: I'd ask that the matter be tabled to a date certain to allow the homeowner and the historical commission to continue their deliberations and discussions.

1253
01:30:49,343 --> 01:30:59,010
[SPEAKER_42]: But with that being said, Mr. President, we do have, I believe, representatives here from the owner that have been working on a plan or are ready to make some commitments to a plan.

1254
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:03,694
[SPEAKER_42]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that the property owner be given an opportunity to speak.

1255
01:31:08,888 --> 01:31:11,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Ari Goldschneider, name and address for the record, please.

1256
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:12,750
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, President.

1257
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:15,252
[SPEAKER_27]: Ari Goldschneider, 1287 Bay Road.

1258
01:31:15,532 --> 01:31:22,396
[SPEAKER_27]: Could you also please unmute Adam Glassman, architect, and Jennifer Platt, council?

1259
01:31:23,516 --> 01:31:25,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, Adam Glassman, you've been unmuted.

1260
01:31:26,078 --> 01:31:31,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Jennifer Platt, you have been, I'm trying to, you've been unmuted.

1261
01:31:31,221 --> 01:31:32,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's been unmuted.

1262
01:31:32,462 --> 01:31:33,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Please continue.

1263
01:31:34,296 --> 01:31:44,698
[SPEAKER_27]: I want to express my appreciation to the City Council and the various other people that attended the Committee of the Whole yesterday.

1264
01:31:44,718 --> 01:31:47,399
[SPEAKER_27]: I think we're close on a compromise.

1265
01:31:47,619 --> 01:31:58,481
[SPEAKER_27]: I want to thank Councilor Marks for brokering or helping broker a potential negotiation.

1266
01:32:00,305 --> 01:32:01,866
[SPEAKER_27]: between the two parties here.

1267
01:32:03,726 --> 01:32:20,172
[SPEAKER_27]: Adam's gonna speak a bit more to what we are proposing, but just in short, we plan on incorporating, you know what, I'm gonna let Adam talk to it.

1268
01:32:20,192 --> 01:32:24,473
[SPEAKER_27]: He's gonna be able to talk to it much more eloquently than I am, so Adam, why don't you go ahead.

1269
01:32:25,393 --> 01:32:26,694
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay, we've got,

1270
01:32:32,122 --> 01:32:34,863
construction.

1271
01:32:34,943 --> 01:32:42,107
[SPEAKER_36]: I think everyone realizes during construction that these elements will not preserved in their current state.

1272
01:32:42,147 --> 01:32:42,487
[SPEAKER_36]: But we can

1273
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:59,598
[SPEAKER_36]: that we're going to be presenting a rendering next hearing on Oct 6th.

1274
01:33:15,094 --> 01:33:17,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President and members of the Council.

1275
01:33:17,076 --> 01:33:23,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for letting us come back and we really appreciate you coming out to the site and taking a look at the property.

1276
01:33:24,221 --> 01:33:28,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you get a much better sense of what we have there.

1277
01:33:29,304 --> 01:33:30,185
[SPEAKER_03]: And while

1278
01:33:30,985 --> 01:33:34,788
[SPEAKER_03]: the existing building is not practical for reuse.

1279
01:33:34,989 --> 01:33:40,453
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had talked about being able to, whether or not you could just save the facade itself.

1280
01:33:41,234 --> 01:33:49,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And from what our engineer and the building inspector confirmed, you can't remove the facade without the whole building collapsing.

1281
01:33:49,921 --> 01:33:55,046
[SPEAKER_03]: What we have been able to do with the input from the city council and from the historical commission is

1282
01:33:57,127 --> 01:34:06,592
[SPEAKER_03]: to incorporate certain aspects, architectural conditions from the front of the building, which will be now incorporated into the plans.

1283
01:34:07,192 --> 01:34:09,353
[SPEAKER_03]: We just had the on-site meeting yesterday.

1284
01:34:09,493 --> 01:34:13,235
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, our architect, Adam Muir, is working on the plans.

1285
01:34:13,275 --> 01:34:14,756
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have them for you yet.

1286
01:34:15,676 --> 01:34:28,209
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are eager to work with you and with the commission to try to incorporate some of those concepts into the new plan so we can continue to have some of that

1287
01:34:30,245 --> 01:34:33,286
[SPEAKER_03]: the reference back to the past into the new building.

1288
01:34:33,306 --> 01:34:48,992
[SPEAKER_03]: We would hope to have these to you, and Adam, correct me if I'm wrong, sometime before the meeting on October 6th, so you can have those, and then we can talk with both the Historical Commission and you.

1289
01:34:49,872 --> 01:34:50,893
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea would be

1290
01:34:52,414 --> 01:35:00,741
[SPEAKER_03]: being able to reach some sort of agreement on these plans and have our good faith to work on those going forward.

1291
01:35:01,181 --> 01:35:16,435
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the request would be, of course, to have the second amendment to the revised ordinances to adopt the single lot historic district, to have that withdrawn once we come forward with revised plans.

1292
01:35:18,004 --> 01:35:18,384
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sure.

1293
01:35:18,404 --> 01:35:19,725
[SPEAKER_27]: architectural elements are

1294
01:35:48,015 --> 01:35:52,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Council, actually, do you want to speak out tonight?

1295
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:54,242
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a couple of councils with the hits.

1296
01:35:54,423 --> 01:35:55,964
[SPEAKER_39]: I got a question if you're ready to give it to me.

1297
01:35:56,084 --> 01:35:56,745
[SPEAKER_39]: I have no problem.

1298
01:35:58,507 --> 01:35:59,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Bears.

1299
01:35:59,709 --> 01:36:00,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Council Bears.

1300
01:36:01,611 --> 01:36:02,412
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1301
01:36:02,973 --> 01:36:04,695
[SPEAKER_34]: And thank you for your presentation.

1302
01:36:06,713 --> 01:36:12,194
[SPEAKER_34]: So I guess it seems like if there's a compromise, you wouldn't want the district to be in place.

1303
01:36:12,234 --> 01:36:13,654
[SPEAKER_34]: And I understand that.

1304
01:36:13,994 --> 01:36:18,235
[SPEAKER_34]: I was just wondering, would the bench and the plaque that was mentioned earlier be a part of this as well?

1305
01:36:19,095 --> 01:36:25,976
[SPEAKER_34]: I really like the idea of taking the timbers that can't be obviously saved and used in the structure and building a bench out of them.

1306
01:36:27,957 --> 01:36:28,977
[SPEAKER_27]: Absolutely, Councilor.

1307
01:36:30,217 --> 01:36:30,477
[SPEAKER_34]: Great.

1308
01:36:30,917 --> 01:36:31,357
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Ari.

1309
01:36:31,377 --> 01:36:35,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions or comments from the Council?

1310
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:39,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1311
01:36:39,221 --> 01:36:45,422
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to thank Ari and Adam and Jennifer for bringing this presentation before us tonight.

1312
01:36:45,462 --> 01:36:51,724
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate all the hard work of the Historic District Commission to kind of get to this level of compromise that hopefully we can see through.

1313
01:36:51,744 --> 01:37:03,367
[SPEAKER_12]: And ideally, this is a model, you know, going forward that we don't have to reach at the 11th hour, but something that we can see how we can work together moving forward to really preserve, balance the needs of the city.

1314
01:37:04,127 --> 01:37:04,527
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

1315
01:37:06,118 --> 01:37:06,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

1316
01:37:07,779 --> 01:37:13,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

1317
01:37:14,003 --> 01:37:16,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Councilor Marks and then Councilor Caraviello.

1318
01:37:16,324 --> 01:37:16,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

1319
01:37:17,805 --> 01:37:18,826
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1320
01:37:19,366 --> 01:37:25,009
[SPEAKER_38]: I just want to thank members of the historic commission that were present there last night.

1321
01:37:25,490 --> 01:37:35,196
[SPEAKER_38]: I want to thank the property owner and, Mr. President, I do want to thank this Meffitt City Council that took the time, Mr. President,

1322
01:37:36,095 --> 01:37:41,159
[SPEAKER_38]: when it didn't look that anything was going to result in this property.

1323
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:48,105
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think we're that much closer to coming to a win-win situation on both sides, Mr. President.

1324
01:37:48,886 --> 01:37:54,230
[SPEAKER_38]: And I want to thank the members of this council that stood up to say, you know what, we'd like to go on a site visit.

1325
01:37:54,971 --> 01:37:57,013
[SPEAKER_38]: We'd like to hear from the property owner.

1326
01:37:57,981 --> 01:38:04,403
[SPEAKER_38]: We'd like to come to a resolve, because we all support the same issues behind this rail, Mr. President.

1327
01:38:04,704 --> 01:38:06,464
[SPEAKER_38]: Don't let anyone kid you otherwise.

1328
01:38:07,064 --> 01:38:08,705
[SPEAKER_38]: We all support it, Mr. President.

1329
01:38:09,285 --> 01:38:19,949
[SPEAKER_38]: And it was because of the due diligence of this council standing up and saying that we believe we can make a difference, that I hope this comes to fruition, Mr. President.

1330
01:38:20,469 --> 01:38:20,790
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1331
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:25,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello.

1332
01:38:26,311 --> 01:38:27,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1333
01:38:27,031 --> 01:38:30,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to reiterate Councilor Marks' comments.

1334
01:38:31,293 --> 01:38:44,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, after all this time waiting, and then all of a sudden on the last hour, we were able to convene and sit with the owners and the commission, everybody, and hopefully

1335
01:38:45,958 --> 01:38:52,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we agreed last night that they would provide a rendering to make the show.

1336
01:38:52,262 --> 01:38:58,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Because again, we only met last night, and I think it would have been hard for them to be able to accomplish something in one day.

1337
01:38:58,246 --> 01:39:04,370
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we all agreed to wait until next week before we made a decision.

1338
01:39:04,710 --> 01:39:06,591
[SPEAKER_02]: But Councilor Baxter's right, we all worked hard here.

1339
01:39:07,212 --> 01:39:12,995
[SPEAKER_02]: We came together as a group and as all the commissions to hopefully come off

1340
01:39:14,116 --> 01:39:17,057
[SPEAKER_02]: to come up with something gamical to make all parties happy.

1341
01:39:17,417 --> 01:39:19,598
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to thank everybody involved for all their work.

1342
01:39:21,559 --> 01:39:22,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1343
01:39:24,761 --> 01:39:26,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, we have Councilor Scarpelli.

1344
01:39:27,302 --> 01:39:28,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1345
01:39:28,082 --> 01:39:37,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, just to reiterate, I think that for what the Historical Commission has in front of them, it's a daunting task when you look at our community and its historical values.

1346
01:39:37,966 --> 01:39:41,268
[SPEAKER_11]: And we all, like Councilman Mark said, I think all of us

1347
01:39:42,749 --> 01:39:56,338
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that the situation that we were put in with this situation had a lot to do with maybe the COVID and the opportunity for both parties to meet in a mutual and respectful manner.

1348
01:39:56,378 --> 01:39:59,520
[SPEAKER_11]: I think both the commission and the homeowner were great.

1349
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:02,042
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate the opportunity to walk through the site.

1350
01:40:03,823 --> 01:40:05,885
[SPEAKER_11]: That piece was glaring, I think.

1351
01:40:05,905 --> 01:40:13,571
[SPEAKER_11]: What's important to me is to sit in front of a home, not behind these chambers, but with the people involved, all in front of each other, face to face.

1352
01:40:14,132 --> 01:40:27,122
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was something as simple as Council Marks' experience by working on this council for many, many years to just bring up a topic that maybe both parties can speak on.

1353
01:40:29,508 --> 01:40:35,731
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is what we're seeing, we're seeing the best of the worst case scenario avoided.

1354
01:40:35,791 --> 01:40:44,455
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, I applaud my colleagues and both the historical commission and the homeowner to reach an agreement.

1355
01:40:44,495 --> 01:40:49,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we've seen our share of greeted developers in our community.

1356
01:40:50,117 --> 01:40:57,360
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this homeowner was very open and honest with us and

1357
01:40:59,961 --> 01:41:11,548
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll work now with our commission to make sure that we are going to keep as much as the historical preservation that we can on that site.

1358
01:41:11,568 --> 01:41:16,631
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, I thank my colleagues and I believe that's a good example of good government.

1359
01:41:16,691 --> 01:41:17,852
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, thank you.

1360
01:41:18,793 --> 01:41:19,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1361
01:41:20,534 --> 01:41:22,575
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to, Councilor Bears.

1362
01:41:24,653 --> 01:41:29,014
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to echo Councilor Marks and my colleagues' comments.

1363
01:41:29,214 --> 01:41:38,837
[SPEAKER_34]: And I also want to say that I think this shows the efficacy of the demo delay and the potential historic district as a tool to ensure that we can have a negotiation and reach a compromise.

1364
01:41:38,897 --> 01:41:45,899
[SPEAKER_34]: I think in many cases in this community with developers, we don't really have much community leverage, and in this case we do.

1365
01:41:46,819 --> 01:41:51,863
[SPEAKER_34]: And I think it's allowed us to meet all of the different pieces of this, right?

1366
01:41:51,963 --> 01:42:05,753
[SPEAKER_34]: It's allowed us to really make sure that development can happen, that housing units can be built, which I think we all agree that, you know, in an apartment district, it makes sense to have, on a lot of that size, it makes sense to have units, while also maintaining historical preservation.

1367
01:42:05,833 --> 01:42:13,818
[SPEAKER_34]: So I just want to say I think it actually shows that, you know, if we didn't have demo delay and we didn't have this historic district proposal, we would just,

1368
01:42:14,759 --> 01:42:21,904
[SPEAKER_34]: have another building of apartments and not something that preserves and kind of highlights the history of shipbuilding in our city.

1369
01:42:21,964 --> 01:42:23,244
[SPEAKER_34]: So thank you, Mr. President.

1370
01:42:23,645 --> 01:42:24,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1371
01:42:24,725 --> 01:42:27,427
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I may, I want to thank everyone that was involved in the process.

1372
01:42:28,508 --> 01:42:38,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, you know, I think it was beneficial to go out to the site to actually have a walk through the property and both inside and outside.

1373
01:42:38,354 --> 01:42:39,375
[SPEAKER_06]: That's always beneficial.

1374
01:42:40,135 --> 01:42:43,016
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd like to thank everyone for their involvement.

1375
01:42:43,956 --> 01:42:46,897
[SPEAKER_06]: But we do have a little bit of an issue.

1376
01:42:46,917 --> 01:42:54,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I did talk to the city solicitor today, and that window is getting smaller and smaller as to what we need to do here.

1377
01:42:55,379 --> 01:43:03,101
[SPEAKER_06]: With regard to the vote that we're supposed to take tonight, it's supposed to be should this be a historical district, okay?

1378
01:43:03,822 --> 01:43:07,002
[SPEAKER_06]: And so tonight would technically be the first reading of this paper.

1379
01:43:08,143 --> 01:43:08,303
[SPEAKER_06]: So-

1380
01:43:10,453 --> 01:43:12,674
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm sorry, provided it passes.

1381
01:43:12,694 --> 01:43:13,194
[SPEAKER_06]: You are correct.

1382
01:43:15,435 --> 01:43:22,618
[SPEAKER_42]: But if, okay.

1383
01:43:23,098 --> 01:43:26,059
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I want to make sure we're all on the same page.

1384
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:28,320
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so, and I thank you for bringing that up.

1385
01:43:28,801 --> 01:43:36,764
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it passes, it would be its first reading and then it would go to the paper for its, so actually yeah, then it would go to the paper for its second reading.

1386
01:43:37,524 --> 01:43:39,305
[SPEAKER_06]: So therefore if we didn't vote tonight,

1387
01:43:41,479 --> 01:43:44,240
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going to happen is, the next meeting is October 6th.

1388
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:51,801
[SPEAKER_06]: And therefore, the second reading wouldn't get into the paper after the demo delay.

1389
01:43:52,321 --> 01:43:54,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, demo delay.

1390
01:43:54,262 --> 01:44:02,963
[SPEAKER_06]: So from what I've been told, we need to make a vote tonight on whether this is actually going to be historic district or not.

1391
01:44:03,104 --> 01:44:07,624
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when it comes back to the third reading, if something changes, then we can go from there.

1392
01:44:07,664 --> 01:44:09,805
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that- We don't receive this information.

1393
01:44:10,566 --> 01:44:11,307
[SPEAKER_30]: And told by whom?

1394
01:44:11,487 --> 01:44:12,609
[SPEAKER_06]: I just called today.

1395
01:44:12,629 --> 01:44:20,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I made this call at 5 o'clock this afternoon, literally right before I came to City Hall.

1396
01:44:21,722 --> 01:44:25,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I like to get all, I like to make sure that, you know what, when this happens, I, you know.

1397
01:44:28,208 --> 01:44:31,790
[SPEAKER_40]: Is the city solicitor available as requested by the president from the meeting yesterday?

1398
01:44:32,050 --> 01:44:34,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked the city solicitor if she was available tonight.

1399
01:44:34,951 --> 01:44:35,591
[SPEAKER_06]: She said no.

1400
01:44:36,012 --> 01:44:41,034
[SPEAKER_06]: She was busy, but we can try giving her a call if you like, if you want to take a brief recess.

1401
01:44:42,394 --> 01:44:48,417
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm just looking at the committee report from last night where President Falco said that the council needs the city solicitor present.

1402
01:44:48,797 --> 01:44:52,319
[SPEAKER_42]: And then the next sentence says Mr. Howard suggested holding off on a historic district.

1403
01:44:52,987 --> 01:44:55,849
[SPEAKER_41]: So that's what I'm referring to is the conversation we had last night.

1404
01:44:55,969 --> 01:44:58,891
[SPEAKER_06]: And I asked the city solicitor today if she could be present tonight.

1405
01:44:59,071 --> 01:44:59,891
[SPEAKER_06]: She said she could not.

1406
01:45:00,492 --> 01:45:02,093
[SPEAKER_06]: But we can try giving her a call if you want.

1407
01:45:02,133 --> 01:45:03,513
[SPEAKER_06]: We can take a brief recess.

1408
01:45:03,553 --> 01:45:04,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I can try getting her on the line.

1409
01:45:05,675 --> 01:45:09,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what the council would like to do?

1410
01:45:09,597 --> 01:45:09,737
[SPEAKER_42]: No.

1411
01:45:10,518 --> 01:45:14,300
[SPEAKER_42]: But with all due respect, Mr. President, I had a conversation with the solicitor as well.

1412
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:18,683
[SPEAKER_42]: And from what the solicitor told me in my conversation with her was that

1413
01:45:19,673 --> 01:45:24,855
[SPEAKER_42]: The issuance of the demolition permit is told when the paper is advertised.

1414
01:45:28,256 --> 01:45:32,818
[SPEAKER_42]: So it doesn't matter if 18 months pass after the paper is advertised.

1415
01:45:32,898 --> 01:45:34,058
[SPEAKER_42]: And there's case law on this.

1416
01:45:34,578 --> 01:45:37,079
[SPEAKER_42]: And she and I spoke about it at length today.

1417
01:45:37,099 --> 01:45:38,019
[SPEAKER_42]: I did too.

1418
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:43,421
[SPEAKER_42]: So I'm not sure if the information that you're getting from her and the information that I'm getting from her are the same.

1419
01:45:44,122 --> 01:45:48,123
[SPEAKER_42]: But I'm pretty confident in the conversation that I had with her where she said, you're absolutely right, Adam.

1420
01:45:48,423 --> 01:45:50,807
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't know why this is so hard to understand.

1421
01:45:51,348 --> 01:45:54,754
[SPEAKER_42]: First reading happens, then it gets advertised, and then advertisement controls.

1422
01:45:55,175 --> 01:46:01,445
[SPEAKER_42]: If advertisement goes out, the demolition permit can't get issued, regardless of whether or not October 8th comes and goes.

1423
01:46:02,603 --> 01:46:06,265
[SPEAKER_42]: So second reading is the advertisement.

1424
01:46:06,705 --> 01:46:09,027
[SPEAKER_42]: And that is what tolls the demolition delay.

1425
01:46:09,307 --> 01:46:12,268
[SPEAKER_42]: And we can toll the demolition delay on October 7th if need be.

1426
01:46:12,728 --> 01:46:21,353
[SPEAKER_42]: So I don't understand the need to take this to a vote right now when you yourself had suggested that the city solicitor needs to be present in order for us to make this vote properly, number one.

1427
01:46:21,373 --> 01:46:27,296
[SPEAKER_42]: And number two, when the representative of the historic commission who was with us at the meeting suggested we hold off on it.

1428
01:46:27,576 --> 01:46:28,477
[SPEAKER_34]: Point of information.

1429
01:46:28,885 --> 01:46:30,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Councilor Bears.

1430
01:46:30,746 --> 01:46:34,948
[SPEAKER_34]: Would the second reading be able to be published on October 7th?

1431
01:46:35,128 --> 01:46:37,349
[SPEAKER_34]: What is the print deadline for the Medford transcript?

1432
01:46:38,410 --> 01:46:39,651
[SPEAKER_34]: Why does it have to be in the transcript?

1433
01:46:39,831 --> 01:46:40,771
[SPEAKER_34]: The Globe runs every day.

1434
01:46:40,811 --> 01:46:41,832
[SPEAKER_41]: The Herald runs every day.

1435
01:46:42,192 --> 01:46:43,633
[SPEAKER_41]: The Globe costs $1,500.

1436
01:46:43,973 --> 01:46:44,773
[SPEAKER_41]: Pay it.

1437
01:46:45,174 --> 01:46:46,034
[SPEAKER_41]: The House is so important.

1438
01:46:46,074 --> 01:46:48,475
[SPEAKER_42]: Why don't we want to spend the money to advertise for it?

1439
01:46:48,595 --> 01:46:50,256
[SPEAKER_42]: I mean, more people read the Globe than the transcript.

1440
01:46:50,276 --> 01:46:52,978
[SPEAKER_42]: I can't tell you a person that ever bought the Medford transcript in the last 15 years.

1441
01:46:53,018 --> 01:46:53,738
[SPEAKER_41]: I don't know one person.

1442
01:46:54,118 --> 01:46:54,558
[SPEAKER_41]: I buy it.

1443
01:46:54,639 --> 01:46:55,319
[SPEAKER_41]: I get it every week.

1444
01:46:56,159 --> 01:46:56,680
[SPEAKER_41]: God bless you.

1445
01:46:56,740 --> 01:46:57,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I know two.

1446
01:46:57,906 --> 01:47:00,050
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1447
01:47:09,652 --> 01:47:18,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Your suggested kind of solution was we could do first reading, second reading, and then if something changes by third, we still have that option to- It's still a third reading.

1448
01:47:18,439 --> 01:47:18,679
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1449
01:47:18,879 --> 01:47:22,762
[SPEAKER_12]: We still have the option to change should the compromise be met and things are satisfied.

1450
01:47:22,782 --> 01:47:23,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1451
01:47:23,123 --> 01:47:29,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you go to the point of the compromise, I mean, have any plans been brought to the building commissioner?

1452
01:47:29,327 --> 01:47:30,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Has the building commissioner seen anything?

1453
01:47:30,708 --> 01:47:32,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I would assume he would have to see that as well.

1454
01:47:32,129 --> 01:47:33,690
[SPEAKER_41]: Between 7 o'clock last night and this morning?

1455
01:47:33,710 --> 01:47:33,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean-

1456
01:47:34,551 --> 01:47:38,312
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that, but you know what, the way I look at it too, it's not our fault we're in this jam right now.

1457
01:47:38,352 --> 01:47:39,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, here we are down here.

1458
01:47:40,332 --> 01:47:40,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

1459
01:47:40,912 --> 01:47:42,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

1460
01:47:45,173 --> 01:47:46,454
[SPEAKER_05]: One second.

1461
01:47:47,434 --> 01:47:48,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

1462
01:47:49,534 --> 01:47:50,535
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1463
01:47:50,555 --> 01:47:52,735
[SPEAKER_38]: And I appreciate both sides on this, believe me.

1464
01:47:53,335 --> 01:48:01,197
[SPEAKER_38]: But after last night's meeting, I think we'd be doing this whole process an injustice to keep on moving the goal pole.

1465
01:48:02,557 --> 01:48:08,848
[SPEAKER_38]: If we keep on moving it, we got a commitment last night to move forward based on what was stated last night.

1466
01:48:09,949 --> 01:48:15,759
[SPEAKER_38]: And that was clear to me, what was stated last night, that we were going to work to maintain the front facade.

1467
01:48:17,037 --> 01:48:18,818
[SPEAKER_38]: And we were not going to move forward.

1468
01:48:18,858 --> 01:48:20,859
[SPEAKER_38]: This is right out of Ryan Hayward's mouth.

1469
01:48:21,379 --> 01:48:22,819
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think I asked him the question.

1470
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:24,960
[SPEAKER_38]: And he said, absolutely, we would wait.

1471
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:26,801
[SPEAKER_38]: He said, we may do it at a later date.

1472
01:48:26,821 --> 01:48:28,142
[SPEAKER_38]: I remember him saying that.

1473
01:48:28,682 --> 01:48:29,922
[SPEAKER_38]: We may do it down the line.

1474
01:48:30,563 --> 01:48:32,283
[SPEAKER_38]: I can't promise you we won't revisit it again.

1475
01:48:32,683 --> 01:48:39,086
[SPEAKER_38]: But at this point, if we're able to move this forward, like we did last night, that we weren't going to move that issue forward.

1476
01:48:39,526 --> 01:48:41,287
[SPEAKER_38]: So now we're hearing that you want to move it.

1477
01:48:41,627 --> 01:48:45,449
[SPEAKER_38]: Because even though it's the first reading, it's still moving the issue forward, right?

1478
01:48:46,529 --> 01:48:53,731
[SPEAKER_38]: However you slice that pie, it's still moving it forward, and that flies in the face of what we agreed upon in good faith last night.

1479
01:48:54,332 --> 01:49:02,714
[SPEAKER_38]: So I don't think we can keep on moving the goal post here and think we're going to come out with a resolve if we're going to change the game as this goes on.

1480
01:49:02,874 --> 01:49:06,135
[SPEAKER_38]: That's all I say, and I don't think that represents either side.

1481
01:49:06,615 --> 01:49:09,436
[SPEAKER_38]: I think that's just common sense in negotiations.

1482
01:49:10,177 --> 01:49:13,638
[SPEAKER_38]: If you don't stick by a negotiation, it's not going to end up working.

1483
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:16,039
[SPEAKER_07]: And I appreciate that.

1484
01:49:16,079 --> 01:49:18,560
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm not saying it has anything to do with you.

1485
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:22,902
[SPEAKER_38]: But what I'm saying is I don't think we should change it at this particular point.

1486
01:49:23,182 --> 01:49:24,522
[SPEAKER_34]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1487
01:49:24,962 --> 01:49:25,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1488
01:49:25,903 --> 01:49:27,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Councilor Bears.

1489
01:49:27,203 --> 01:49:32,426
[SPEAKER_34]: I just got a message from Ryan Hayward that they have approved the cost to run it in the Herald or Globe if needed.

1490
01:49:32,526 --> 01:49:35,387
[SPEAKER_34]: So I'm comfortable tabling until the 6th.

1491
01:49:36,648 --> 01:49:39,049
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm glad Ryan gave you approval.

1492
01:49:40,889 --> 01:49:42,490
[SPEAKER_27]: President, can I speak, please?

1493
01:49:42,910 --> 01:49:44,131
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, Mr. Goldschneider, please.

1494
01:49:45,326 --> 01:49:49,410
[SPEAKER_27]: I think we had a very productive discussion last night.

1495
01:49:49,530 --> 01:50:11,928
[SPEAKER_27]: A lot of issues were flushed out in person and we came to, I'll just call it like a business arrangement with the local historic commission, local historic district commission, an arrangement, an agreement in principle that in return for

1496
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:24,886
[SPEAKER_27]: to incorporate certain items, architectural items from the existing home into the new design.

1497
01:50:24,906 --> 01:50:36,795
[SPEAKER_27]: And now what Councilor Beals brought up with regard to the historical market, including those two items, it was my understanding based on the dialogue last night,

1498
01:50:37,475 --> 01:50:48,162
[SPEAKER_27]: that moving forward with the historic district would not continue pending the review of the plans on October 6th.

1499
01:50:48,242 --> 01:50:56,908
[SPEAKER_27]: So this has sort of surprised me, because I thought that we had agreed to something in principle and now things are sort of changing here.

1500
01:50:57,168 --> 01:50:58,489
[SPEAKER_27]: I wasn't prepared.

1501
01:50:58,809 --> 01:51:04,573
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing I was doing was giving the council information that I got.

1502
01:51:04,613 --> 01:51:05,874
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I was doing, okay?

1503
01:51:09,637 --> 01:51:11,638
[SPEAKER_34]: I second Councilor Knight's motion to table.

1504
01:51:12,019 --> 01:51:13,980
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is a motion on the floor.

1505
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:14,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

1506
01:51:15,261 --> 01:51:24,208
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, before we table the matter, there is a committee of the whole report that's before us that's going to have to get put into the agenda for next week's meeting for us to vote on.

1507
01:51:24,628 --> 01:51:31,334
[SPEAKER_42]: But last night at the site visit, we did vote on a motion to ask a question of the city solicitor.

1508
01:51:32,316 --> 01:51:40,482
[SPEAKER_42]: And that question that we asked to the city solicitor was, can this process constitute a regulatory taking, opening up the city to financial or other liabilities?

1509
01:51:41,062 --> 01:51:47,787
[SPEAKER_42]: And I'd like to offer that question to the city solicitor as a B paper this evening, so that we can get that to her for an answer as well before next week.

1510
01:51:48,548 --> 01:51:50,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we'll take the B paper first.

1511
01:51:50,889 --> 01:51:53,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise, do you have the wording in the B paper?

1512
01:51:53,131 --> 01:51:53,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise, Mr. President.

1513
01:52:02,715 --> 01:52:04,556
[SPEAKER_29]: I have the first part.

1514
01:52:04,576 --> 01:52:07,097
[SPEAKER_29]: Can this process be considered regulatory taking?

1515
01:52:08,158 --> 01:52:10,379
[SPEAKER_42]: Opening the city up to financial or other liabilities.

1516
01:52:14,081 --> 01:52:15,462
[SPEAKER_28]: Financial or other liabilities.

1517
01:52:20,685 --> 01:52:20,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1518
01:52:22,606 --> 01:52:22,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Got it.

1519
01:52:22,926 --> 01:52:26,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1520
01:52:26,508 --> 01:52:29,430
[SPEAKER_06]: On that motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by

1521
01:52:31,923 --> 01:52:34,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello, Clerk Hunter, please call the roll.

1522
01:52:34,224 --> 01:52:35,685
[SPEAKER_06]: This is on the B paper.

1523
01:52:39,248 --> 01:52:40,028
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Ferris?

1524
01:52:40,328 --> 01:52:40,588
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

1525
01:52:41,789 --> 01:52:42,750
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello?

1526
01:52:42,950 --> 01:52:43,170
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1527
01:52:44,231 --> 01:52:44,771
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight?

1528
01:52:44,891 --> 01:52:45,211
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

1529
01:52:46,012 --> 01:52:46,572
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks?

1530
01:52:46,752 --> 01:52:47,012
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

1531
01:52:47,993 --> 01:52:48,633
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell?

1532
01:52:48,894 --> 01:52:49,154
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1533
01:52:50,214 --> 01:52:51,095
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1534
01:52:51,275 --> 01:52:51,475
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

1535
01:52:52,496 --> 01:52:53,236
[SPEAKER_29]: President Falco?

1536
01:52:53,476 --> 01:52:53,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1537
01:52:55,001 --> 01:52:58,904
[SPEAKER_06]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, the motion passes on the B paper.

1538
01:52:59,324 --> 01:53:02,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight, did you have another resolution or another?

1539
01:53:02,507 --> 01:53:03,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to table?

1540
01:53:03,047 --> 01:53:05,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, a motion to table, that is undebatable.

1541
01:53:06,410 --> 01:53:09,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to table on the floor offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by?

1542
01:53:10,292 --> 01:53:10,653
[SPEAKER_29]: Second.

1543
01:53:10,973 --> 01:53:11,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears.

1544
01:53:12,074 --> 01:53:13,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

1545
01:53:13,875 --> 01:53:17,638
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President, is this tabling to a date, sir, or is this tabling indefinitely?

1546
01:53:20,370 --> 01:53:21,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's no meeting next week.

1547
01:53:23,131 --> 01:53:24,611
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's Councilor Knight.

1548
01:53:24,671 --> 01:53:25,611
[SPEAKER_40]: October 6th, right?

1549
01:53:26,071 --> 01:53:28,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, it's a table to a date certain, which is October 6th.

1550
01:53:29,292 --> 01:53:30,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I correct, Councilor Knight?

1551
01:53:30,552 --> 01:53:31,932
[SPEAKER_40]: Sounds right to me, Mr. President.

1552
01:53:31,952 --> 01:53:36,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Councilor Knight, his motion is to table to a date certain of October 6th.

1553
01:53:37,034 --> 01:53:39,154
[SPEAKER_06]: That motion was seconded by Councilor Bears.

1554
01:53:39,614 --> 01:53:40,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

1555
01:53:41,494 --> 01:53:42,075
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears?

1556
01:53:42,455 --> 01:53:42,775
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

1557
01:53:43,735 --> 01:53:44,655
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello?

1558
01:53:44,875 --> 01:53:45,095
Yes.

1559
01:53:45,895 --> 01:53:46,395
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight?

1560
01:53:46,475 --> 01:53:46,776
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

1561
01:53:47,476 --> 01:53:48,036
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks?

1562
01:53:48,336 --> 01:53:48,556
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1563
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:50,120
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell.

1564
01:53:50,541 --> 01:53:50,881
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1565
01:53:51,741 --> 01:53:54,283
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1566
01:53:54,323 --> 01:53:54,523
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

1567
01:53:54,543 --> 01:53:56,924
[SPEAKER_06]: President Falco.

1568
01:53:56,984 --> 01:53:57,485
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1569
01:53:58,825 --> 01:54:00,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1570
01:54:00,906 --> 01:54:03,008
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes to table six to one.

1571
01:54:03,028 --> 01:54:05,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1572
01:54:05,749 --> 01:54:07,090
[SPEAKER_40]: Motion to revert back to regular order of business.

1573
01:54:07,570 --> 01:54:15,875
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of council, I'd like to revert back to the regular order of business, and that is seconded by Vice President Caraviello. Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

1574
01:54:21,219 --> 01:54:21,499
[SPEAKER_23]: No.

1575
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:27,160
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd move to take all communications from the mayor out of order.

1576
01:54:27,180 --> 01:54:29,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I thought it was just the first one.

1577
01:54:29,501 --> 01:54:31,561
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I meant all of them, but it's fine.

1578
01:54:32,601 --> 01:54:32,701
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1579
01:54:34,862 --> 01:54:38,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any objection to us continuing with the papers from the mayor?

1580
01:54:38,642 --> 01:54:40,122
[SPEAKER_39]: Should I be asked to withdraw my motion?

1581
01:54:40,202 --> 01:54:40,823
[SPEAKER_39]: I'd be happy to.

1582
01:54:40,903 --> 01:54:41,543
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, thank you.

1583
01:54:41,603 --> 01:54:42,983
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Counsel Knight.

1584
01:54:43,103 --> 01:54:45,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Counsel Knight, would you please withdraw your motion?

1585
01:54:45,883 --> 01:54:46,284
[SPEAKER_39]: Certainly.

1586
01:54:46,404 --> 01:54:46,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1587
01:54:46,864 --> 01:54:48,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Counsel Knight has withdrawn his motion.

1588
01:54:49,403 --> 01:54:53,306
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are still on the papers from the mayor.

1589
01:54:56,468 --> 01:54:57,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Communications from the mayor.

1590
01:54:58,929 --> 01:54:59,290
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is 20-566.

1591
01:55:03,567 --> 01:55:14,256
[SPEAKER_06]: September 17, 2020, the electronic delivery to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, regarding Home Rule Petition Charter Commission.

1592
01:55:15,077 --> 01:55:25,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear Mr. President and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approve the following Home Rule Petition and transmit to the General Court for their consideration.

1593
01:55:25,947 --> 01:55:27,929

1594
01:55:27,969 --> 01:55:30,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Sincerely, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

1595
01:55:33,038 --> 01:55:36,581
[SPEAKER_06]: An act authorizing the election of a charter commission in the city of Medford.

1596
01:55:37,122 --> 01:55:45,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives and General Court assembled and by the authority of the same as follows.

1597
01:55:45,309 --> 01:55:56,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Section one, notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 43B of the general laws of the provisions of any general law, special law or regulation to the contrary, the city of Medford.

1598
01:55:59,262 --> 01:56:13,709
[SPEAKER_06]: The city the city of Medford City Council shall at the first regular city regular city election or a fogging up City election or early occurring special election held

1599
01:56:14,665 --> 01:56:32,545
[SPEAKER_06]: On or after the 60th day following the effective date of this act, by order, provide for submission to the voters of the city the question of adopting or revising a charter and for the election of a nine member charter commission.

1600
01:56:33,326 --> 01:56:50,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Section two, other than as set forth herein, the provisions of chapter 43B of the general laws shall be applicable to the nomination and election of charter commissioners and to the duties and responsibilities of the city and the charter commission elected here under.

1601

[SPEAKER_06]: Section three, this act shall take effect upon its passage.

1602
01:56:56,468 --> 01:56:57,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears.

1603
01:56:59,465 --> 01:57:00,326
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1604
01:57:00,766 --> 01:57:03,267
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm incredibly glad to see this item before the council.

1605
01:57:03,287 --> 01:57:05,769
[SPEAKER_34]: I think charter reviews are long overdue in our community.

1606
01:57:05,829 --> 01:57:08,251
[SPEAKER_34]: I think this charter was last reviewed before I was born.

1607
01:57:08,271 --> 01:57:18,697
[SPEAKER_34]: And empowering this council and ensuring greater representation and diversity on the council are one of the many ways I hope, one of the many changes I hope the Charter Commission would explore.

1608
01:57:18,717 --> 01:57:20,278
[SPEAKER_34]: I do have a question.

1609
01:57:20,439 --> 01:57:24,961
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm not sure if a representative of the city administration will be able to answer it or who we have.

1610
01:57:26,242 --> 01:57:27,823
[SPEAKER_34]: We have Jackie Peeks.

1611
01:57:27,863 --> 01:57:30,984
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm not sure if Jackie has this information off the top of her head.

1612
01:57:31,004 --> 01:57:35,426
[SPEAKER_34]: And maybe my colleagues, I'm especially thinking Councilor Knight might have the answer.

1613
01:57:36,606 --> 01:57:42,548
[SPEAKER_34]: If this were approved tonight, would it be disposed of by the legislature at the end of this session in December?

1614
01:57:43,009 --> 01:57:48,731
[SPEAKER_34]: And would a new home rule petition have to be sent after the new general court session begins in January?

1615
01:57:48,751 --> 01:57:50,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you, Councilor Bears.

1616
01:57:50,932 --> 01:57:53,613
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Jackie Peeks, who is representing the administration tonight.

1617
01:57:53,973 --> 01:57:54,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Jackie.

1618
01:57:56,821 --> 01:57:58,523
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Councilor, for that question.

1619
01:57:58,543 --> 01:58:02,986
[SPEAKER_33]: I do not know off the top of my head, but I will certainly find out and report back to the council.

1620
01:58:05,188 --> 01:58:06,949
[SPEAKER_34]: I think Councilor Knight might have said yes.

1621
01:58:07,710 --> 01:58:14,455
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, if the legislation doesn't pass by the close of the end of the legislative session, then the bill needs to be reintroduced for the next legislative session.

1622
01:58:15,636 --> 01:58:16,537
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Councilor.

1623
01:58:16,757 --> 01:58:17,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1624
01:58:17,377 --> 01:58:22,401
[SPEAKER_42]: The question would come as to whether or not we need to pass another home rule petition to reintroduce the bill in the next legislative session.

1625
01:58:22,902 --> 01:58:23,862
[SPEAKER_42]: And that I can't answer.

1626
01:58:24,923 --> 01:58:25,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1627
01:58:30,036 --> 01:58:30,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Jackie.

1628
01:58:32,196 --> 01:58:36,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight, I'm sorry, did you have a question?

1629
01:58:36,317 --> 01:58:41,919
[SPEAKER_39]: Is that a question you'd like to ask the solicitor?

1630
01:58:43,119 --> 01:58:45,580
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, I would be happy to ask the solicitor.

1631
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:47,781
[SPEAKER_34]: I'll ask on my own, thank you.

1632
01:58:49,721 --> 01:58:50,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1633
01:58:51,662 --> 01:58:53,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions from the council on this?

1634
01:58:57,912 --> 01:58:58,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Layton.

1635
01:58:58,832 --> 01:59:01,313
[SPEAKER_42]: I, for one, will not be supporting this paper this evening, Mr. President.

1636
01:59:01,333 --> 01:59:03,033
[SPEAKER_42]: We're in the middle of a global pandemic.

1637
01:59:03,153 --> 01:59:08,655
[SPEAKER_42]: We had a meeting for two hours today talking about how we're unable to conduct regular city council business right now.

1638
01:59:09,635 --> 01:59:12,156
[SPEAKER_42]: One out of five adults in Massachusetts are unemployed.

1639
01:59:12,196 --> 01:59:13,796
[SPEAKER_42]: We have a 20% unemployment rate.

1640
01:59:13,816 --> 01:59:17,257
[SPEAKER_42]: We're seeing the worst economic time since the Great Depression.

1641
01:59:18,137 --> 01:59:22,078
[SPEAKER_42]: People are restricted in their ability to get about the community, to speak with people, to talk to people.

1642
01:59:22,098 --> 01:59:24,239
[SPEAKER_42]: It's going to impact the ability to run a grassroots campaign.

1643
01:59:24,819 --> 01:59:27,440
[SPEAKER_42]: and inform the residents in this community what's going on, number one.

1644
01:59:28,281 --> 01:59:31,222
[SPEAKER_42]: Number two, in times of uncertainty, we need stability.

1645
01:59:32,663 --> 01:59:34,284
[SPEAKER_42]: In times of uncertainty, we need stability.

1646
01:59:34,524 --> 01:59:36,345
[SPEAKER_42]: We should be focusing on getting our kids back to school.

1647
01:59:36,425 --> 01:59:39,266
[SPEAKER_42]: We should be focusing on getting our economy locally back up and running.

1648
01:59:39,346 --> 01:59:46,109
[SPEAKER_42]: I think that's what our priority should be right now during this global pandemic, things that actually make the community and the city run, the services that we deliver.

1649
01:59:46,730 --> 01:59:50,771
[SPEAKER_42]: You know, I've stated and I've been opposed to this process in the past, doing it with the homework petition.

1650
01:59:50,792 --> 01:59:53,493
[SPEAKER_42]: I feel as though this is something that should come from the voters, that should come from the ground up.

1651
01:59:54,113 --> 02:00:00,079
[SPEAKER_42]: And now is not the time to promote a ground up effort when the activities of people are so hamstrung.

1652
02:00:00,559 --> 02:00:04,302
[SPEAKER_42]: And where our government is operating under such stringent restrictions.

1653
02:00:04,783 --> 02:00:07,305
[SPEAKER_42]: So for those reasons, I'll be voting against the paper this evening, Mr. President.

1654
02:00:07,405 --> 02:00:07,926
[SPEAKER_42]: I rest my case.

1655
02:00:08,466 --> 02:00:09,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1656
02:00:11,489 --> 02:00:12,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other councilors want to speak on this?

1657
02:00:13,771 --> 02:00:15,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so we have a number.

1658
02:00:15,232 --> 02:00:16,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's see.

1659
02:00:17,174 --> 02:00:19,716
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go with Councilor Marks and then Councilor Scarpelli.

1660
02:00:19,776 --> 02:00:20,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

1661
02:00:21,736 --> 02:00:27,420
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my colleague, Councilor Knight, for his comments.

1662
02:00:28,121 --> 02:00:34,326
[SPEAKER_38]: This indeed is a very difficult time to move forward on such a large endeavor.

1663
02:00:35,307 --> 02:00:35,888
[SPEAKER_38]: However,

1664
02:00:37,077 --> 02:00:46,645
[SPEAKER_38]: It was back in February of 2016 when I offered the original home rule petition, which I believe some members of the council were on.

1665
02:00:47,405 --> 02:00:50,628
[SPEAKER_38]: It reads a little different from what the mayor is offering.

1666
02:00:51,108 --> 02:00:55,652
[SPEAKER_38]: At the time, we were looking at a seven member commission.

1667
02:00:57,013 --> 02:01:05,220
[SPEAKER_38]: We also outlined when a final report would be back with recommendations, which at the time we thought was

1668
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:15,284
[SPEAKER_38]: key component to moving this along, because if you leave it open ended, the process inherently is a long process to start off with.

1669
02:01:15,924 --> 02:01:25,728
[SPEAKER_38]: When we reviewed this back in 2016, February 2016, we were looking at potential ballot questions in 2019 or 2020.

1670
02:01:29,636 --> 02:01:34,500
[SPEAKER_38]: So that shows you it's at least a two to three year process.

1671
02:01:35,581 --> 02:01:43,788
[SPEAKER_38]: Built into that number is at the time what we established was an 18 month review process.

1672
02:01:44,409 --> 02:01:53,176
[SPEAKER_38]: So once you establish a commission, then they had roughly 18 months to go through a charter that hasn't been reviewed in 34 years.

1673
02:01:55,413 --> 02:02:06,223
[SPEAKER_38]: A charter that's only been changed over the last 34 years, ironically, to give increases to the mayor's salary, which is under the city charter.

1674
02:02:07,083 --> 02:02:13,089
[SPEAKER_38]: And that's the only really review that's been looked at when it comes to charter review in this community.

1675
02:02:14,370 --> 02:02:18,134
[SPEAKER_38]: The charter is the constitution that governs our community.

1676
02:02:18,734 --> 02:02:27,564
[SPEAKER_38]: It's a vital document that I'd say most people in the community are unaware of because, let's be quite frank, we haven't reviewed it in 34 years.

1677
02:02:27,864 --> 02:02:33,870
[SPEAKER_38]: There hasn't been much discussion and people are just not aware of what the charter defines.

1678
02:02:34,791 --> 02:02:48,698
[SPEAKER_38]: And there's a number of issues within the charter or responsibilities and powers that define how government operates, the length of terms, the duties and powers and responsibilities.

1679
02:02:49,918 --> 02:02:57,902
[SPEAKER_38]: And it is extremely vital, even during a pandemic, that we focus on a charter review.

1680
02:02:58,923 --> 02:03:03,585
[SPEAKER_38]: And I, as one member of the council, think there's no better time than the present

1681
02:03:04,369 --> 02:03:10,352
[SPEAKER_38]: to start the ball rolling and take a look at what we need to do.

1682
02:03:10,892 --> 02:03:16,715
[SPEAKER_38]: And this is not putting a stamp of approval saying that things will be changed in the charter.

1683
02:03:17,055 --> 02:03:19,257
[SPEAKER_38]: We're asking for a charter commission.

1684
02:03:19,857 --> 02:03:29,282
[SPEAKER_38]: The commission may sit down and look at the charter and say, wow, you guys created a perfect charter 34 years ago, and we don't think anything needs to be done to this charter.

1685
02:03:30,182 --> 02:03:31,483
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't think that's going to be the case.

1686
02:03:32,756 --> 02:03:33,996
[SPEAKER_38]: But that could happen.

1687
02:03:34,717 --> 02:03:37,898
[SPEAKER_38]: So this is not saying the charter's going to be changed in any way.

1688
02:03:38,278 --> 02:03:40,919
[SPEAKER_38]: It's just saying, let's create a review process.

1689
02:03:41,879 --> 02:03:49,863
[SPEAKER_38]: Many charters that, if you look at cities and towns, they have a built-in periodic review of the charter.

1690
02:03:50,743 --> 02:03:55,665
[SPEAKER_38]: When ours was created some 34 years ago, there was no built-in review.

1691
02:03:56,045 --> 02:04:00,827
[SPEAKER_38]: Hence why we're at a point now that the charter's never been reviewed.

1692
02:04:01,963 --> 02:04:23,111
[SPEAKER_38]: So when I offered the resolution back in 2016, the home rule petition, one of the recommendations that was part of that petition was that at a minimum, an amendment be present in the city charter instituting an appointed committee to conduct a periodic review of the charter.

1693
02:04:24,335 --> 02:04:36,823
[SPEAKER_38]: So at a minimum, whatever happened, if there were no change at all, then at least we know going forward, and I agree with this 1,000%, I don't know where my colleagues stand, that this charter should be reviewed every so often.

1694
02:04:36,863 --> 02:04:42,146
[SPEAKER_38]: Whether it's yearly, whether it's every few years, whatever it might be, it needs to be reviewed.

1695
02:04:42,586 --> 02:04:46,669
[SPEAKER_38]: If you had a business plan from 35 years ago, you would be out of business right now.

1696
02:04:47,651 --> 02:04:53,953
[SPEAKER_38]: And the charter is no different, it's a business plan how we operate a community and how we run a community.

1697
02:04:54,953 --> 02:04:58,794
[SPEAKER_38]: And so I think it's very important that we move forward tonight.

1698
02:04:59,654 --> 02:05:04,075
[SPEAKER_38]: If it does calling for a refiling next year, then so be it.

1699
02:05:04,875 --> 02:05:06,516
[SPEAKER_38]: So be it, we refile it again.

1700
02:05:07,036 --> 02:05:12,137
[SPEAKER_38]: When we filed this back in 2016, it was a four to three vote.

1701
02:05:13,408 --> 02:05:15,529
[SPEAKER_38]: It passed four to three.

1702
02:05:16,309 --> 02:05:18,129
[SPEAKER_38]: We sent it to the state legislature.

1703
02:05:18,729 --> 02:05:24,351
[SPEAKER_38]: Many of us that were supportive of this back in 2016 followed through the process.

1704
02:05:25,451 --> 02:05:28,192
[SPEAKER_38]: Unfortunately, the process did not exist.

1705
02:05:28,872 --> 02:05:42,495
[SPEAKER_38]: The chairman of the committee, and his name escapes me right now, decided on his own, Mr. President, because I talked to him back in 2016, decided on his own not to give this a hearing.

1706
02:05:44,332 --> 02:05:56,531
[SPEAKER_38]: And I asked, why would you not give a petition that's before you, a home rule petition that's crafted by a city saying the city wants it, the representatives, the forefathers of the city said, we want this.

1707
02:05:57,372 --> 02:05:59,336
[SPEAKER_38]: And his answer to me, Mr. President,

1708
02:06:00,819 --> 02:06:07,608
[SPEAKER_38]: was that I don't believe that the four to three vote was a majority of the council.

1709
02:06:07,968 --> 02:06:11,252
[SPEAKER_38]: It didn't represent a majority of the council.

1710
02:06:11,833 --> 02:06:15,898
[SPEAKER_38]: And I question saying a four to three vote is a majority of the council.

1711
02:06:16,559 --> 02:06:22,601
[SPEAKER_38]: And it's no difference when you vote as a state legislator that a majority wins, a majority rules.

1712
02:06:23,281 --> 02:06:29,264
[SPEAKER_38]: And at the time, he just disagreed and didn't give it the proper hearing that it should have received, Mr. President.

1713
02:06:29,804 --> 02:06:37,707
[SPEAKER_38]: So I'm hoping this time, and I know there's some members that are hesitant with this, Mr. President, but I would respectfully ask my colleagues.

1714
02:06:38,547 --> 02:06:41,271
[SPEAKER_38]: that allow this to move forward.

1715
02:06:41,591 --> 02:06:44,735
[SPEAKER_38]: This is the first step in many steps.

1716
02:06:45,156 --> 02:06:47,499
[SPEAKER_38]: This is a two to three year process.

1717
02:06:48,380 --> 02:06:49,882
[SPEAKER_38]: This is not going to happen overnight.

1718
02:06:50,382 --> 02:06:54,988
[SPEAKER_38]: And I'm hoping as we move forward, Mr. President, that the pandemic will be behind us.

1719
02:06:55,984 --> 02:06:59,668
[SPEAKER_38]: That's how long this process is going to take, and I'm hoping that's behind us.

1720
02:07:00,308 --> 02:07:13,182
[SPEAKER_38]: So regarding the signatures that are required, I believe it's 15% of the number of registered voters that you have in the community to put it on the ballot.

1721
02:07:16,069 --> 02:07:34,233
[SPEAKER_38]: We've had people of the community for the last several years, some good people that have walked around, knocked doors, stood in front of stores, got thousands of signatures, still fell short of the mark of the 15% that's required, Mr. President, but did yeoman's work.

1722
02:07:34,673 --> 02:07:38,454
[SPEAKER_38]: And I believe there's enough support out there in the community to move this forward.

1723
02:07:39,194 --> 02:07:40,935
[SPEAKER_38]: Why not assist, if we can,

1724
02:07:41,895 --> 02:07:47,721
[SPEAKER_38]: As legislators for this city, why not assist in moving the process forward?

1725
02:07:50,503 --> 02:07:53,646
[SPEAKER_38]: Not disregarding a process, the signatures is one process.

1726
02:07:54,086 --> 02:07:56,388
[SPEAKER_38]: A home rule petition is another process.

1727
02:07:57,469 --> 02:07:59,631
[SPEAKER_38]: There's more ways than one to skin a cat.

1728
02:08:00,532 --> 02:08:02,174
[SPEAKER_38]: We're skinning a cat a different way.

1729
02:08:02,734 --> 02:08:05,357
[SPEAKER_38]: We're going to the legislative home rule petition.

1730
02:08:06,721 --> 02:08:08,422
[SPEAKER_38]: It's long overdue, Mr. President.

1731
02:08:08,823 --> 02:08:12,826
[SPEAKER_38]: I appreciate there's a lot of opinions on this, and it hasn't been looked at.

1732
02:08:12,966 --> 02:08:19,371
[SPEAKER_38]: And some people may see this as a struggle for power, some people may see it all different ways.

1733
02:08:20,292 --> 02:08:27,958
[SPEAKER_38]: I see it, Mr. President, as good government in reviewing a document that really requires review in this day and age.

1734
02:08:28,258 --> 02:08:30,740
[SPEAKER_38]: The city has changed in the last 35 years.

1735
02:08:32,526 --> 02:08:34,368
[SPEAKER_38]: And we should change with the times as well.

1736
02:08:35,189 --> 02:08:39,874
[SPEAKER_38]: So I respectfully ask my colleagues to take a long look at this tonight.

1737
02:08:40,334 --> 02:08:42,557
[SPEAKER_38]: I will be supporting this tonight, Mr. President.

1738
02:08:43,217 --> 02:08:45,139
[SPEAKER_38]: Like I said, to move the first step forward.

1739
02:08:45,740 --> 02:08:46,100
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1740
02:08:48,578 --> 02:08:49,478
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1741
02:08:50,059 --> 02:09:00,904
[SPEAKER_12]: Echoing a lot of what's been said already, this is something that is long overdue, and I thank the administration for introducing this, highlighting the fact that, as Councilor Mark said, this is, it's a review, it's just that.

1742
02:09:01,804 --> 02:09:13,390
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a long process that I think we absolutely need to start as soon as possible, and every election since I've lived in Medford, this has been an issue, and I think we owe it to the citizens of this city to move forward in good faith to do

1743
02:09:14,170 --> 02:09:19,412
[SPEAKER_12]: just what this is, which is review to look at what we're operating on, and I support this measure.

1744
02:09:19,792 --> 02:09:20,112
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1745
02:09:20,252 --> 02:09:21,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

1746
02:09:21,252 --> 02:09:22,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1747
02:09:22,073 --> 02:09:23,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1748
02:09:24,473 --> 02:09:39,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Like Councilor Mock said, I too supported this in 2016, but I will tell you, I think that because the process does take the time that it will take, unfortunately, this isn't something that this council created or this council

1749
02:09:41,059 --> 02:09:44,702
[SPEAKER_11]: This council delayed, I think I was one of the four councils voted for that in the past.

1750
02:09:45,182 --> 02:09:51,026
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think Councilor Knight brings up a very important point that we started our subcommittee meeting with.

1751
02:09:51,346 --> 02:09:54,509
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so much going on right now in our community that we,

1752
02:09:56,910 --> 02:10:00,774
[SPEAKER_11]: The focus has to be on the bigger things in our community right now.

1753
02:10:00,814 --> 02:10:03,316
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something that needs to be done down the line.

1754
02:10:03,376 --> 02:10:10,183
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that hopefully as you see things turn and people are back in this chamber and we get to move things forward.

1755
02:10:10,523 --> 02:10:14,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Kids are back in school and city business is done a little bit differently.

1756
02:10:15,067 --> 02:10:16,389
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that I'll go back.

1757
02:10:17,089 --> 02:10:30,860
[SPEAKER_11]: But as of tonight, I think there are too many variables and too many issues that our city is dealing with right now to even spend a minute focused on charter review, considering that, like I said, it is a two to three year process.

1758
02:10:30,920 --> 02:10:33,863
[SPEAKER_11]: And right now, I think we need to focus on

1759
02:10:35,805 --> 02:10:37,186
[SPEAKER_11]: issues that are in front of us right now.

1760
02:10:37,266 --> 02:10:46,613
[SPEAKER_11]: So, again, I thank both Councilor Marks and Councilor Knights viewpoints on both, but I will not be supporting this this evening.

1761
02:10:46,713 --> 02:10:47,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1762
02:10:47,153 --> 02:10:48,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1763
02:10:48,414 --> 02:10:49,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello.

1764
02:10:49,835 --> 02:10:50,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1765
02:10:50,556 --> 02:10:59,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I was part of the council when this came up the last time, and I did not support it back then.

1766
02:10:59,563 --> 02:11:00,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks made some

1767
02:11:01,604 --> 02:11:03,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good points there, and I do agree with them.

1768
02:11:04,205 --> 02:11:08,587
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also agree with Councilor Knight that right now is really not the time for this.

1769
02:11:09,027 --> 02:11:13,970
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got many other things happening in the city that are much more important than this.

1770
02:11:15,535 --> 02:11:23,541
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think once the kids are back in school and we're back and doing regular business here, this would be something I could support.

1771
02:11:23,821 --> 02:11:27,264
[SPEAKER_02]: But at this particular time, I can't support it tonight.

1772
02:11:28,184 --> 02:11:36,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because, as I said, we've got way too many things happening in this city and other business needs to be done at this particular time, Mr. President.

1773
02:11:36,830 --> 02:11:37,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1774
02:11:38,231 --> 02:11:39,532
[SPEAKER_34]: Mr. President, motion to approve.

1775
02:11:41,734 --> 02:11:43,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Council members?

1776
02:11:44,201 --> 02:11:45,022
[SPEAKER_34]: Motion to approve.

1777
02:11:45,042 --> 02:11:49,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Bears, seconded by- Mr. President.

1778
02:11:49,566 --> 02:11:50,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor Morell.

1779
02:11:51,488 --> 02:11:52,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

1780
02:11:55,551 --> 02:11:57,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, let me do that, one minute.

1781
02:11:59,435 --> 02:12:01,817
[SPEAKER_38]: Councilor Marks, there you go.

1782
02:12:01,937 --> 02:12:06,941
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I don't like to dwell on the past, but knowing what happened in 2016,

1783
02:12:09,195 --> 02:12:12,879
[SPEAKER_38]: And I'm not sure if that representative is still even the chairman of that committee.

1784
02:12:12,899 --> 02:12:16,163
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't know if it was the committee on local affairs.

1785
02:12:16,183 --> 02:12:17,484
[SPEAKER_38]: I can't even remember the name.

1786
02:12:19,727 --> 02:12:20,828
[SPEAKER_38]: Maybe election laws.

1787
02:12:21,349 --> 02:12:22,950
[SPEAKER_38]: John Rogers, is that something?

1788
02:12:22,970 --> 02:12:25,053
[SPEAKER_38]: Maybe it was Representative Rogers.

1789
02:12:26,674 --> 02:12:28,016
[SPEAKER_38]: I can't recall, Mr. President.

1790
02:12:28,476 --> 02:12:29,077
[SPEAKER_38]: I got a lot of.

1791
02:12:30,126 --> 02:12:33,648
[SPEAKER_38]: Useful information stuck in my head.

1792
02:12:33,928 --> 02:12:36,490
[SPEAKER_38]: Useless information stuck in my head, but that's not one of it.

1793
02:12:36,890 --> 02:12:56,863
[SPEAKER_38]: But I would just ask, Mr. President, respectfully that I would hate to pass something that is going to be on the same wave as we did in 2016 and then only go up to the State House and them say that it doesn't have the support of the city because of the vote.

1794
02:12:58,204 --> 02:12:59,685
[SPEAKER_38]: or the sheer number of votes.

1795
02:13:01,127 --> 02:13:16,725
[SPEAKER_38]: So I can see what my colleagues are stating, that this may not be the best time, but if we looked at maybe the beginning of the next fiscal year, January, does that sound like a time that

1796
02:13:18,373 --> 02:13:20,354
[SPEAKER_38]: would be amendable to other members of the council.

1797
02:13:20,634 --> 02:13:22,255
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't know if it's strictly just the time.

1798
02:13:22,555 --> 02:13:26,717
[SPEAKER_38]: They may have other philosophical differences with charter review and so forth.

1799
02:13:27,418 --> 02:13:33,221
[SPEAKER_38]: But if that's the case, I wouldn't mind holding off until January, Mr. President.

1800
02:13:33,701 --> 02:13:38,563
[SPEAKER_38]: Especially if this did happen to go down tonight, we couldn't bring it up again for what, 90 days?

1801
02:13:40,098 --> 02:13:42,820
[SPEAKER_38]: So you're looking at that time frame anyways.

1802
02:13:43,860 --> 02:13:51,865
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm prepared to vote on it tonight, but I just would hate to see this go down the same way, because I really believe in it strongly.

1803
02:13:51,905 --> 02:13:53,966
[SPEAKER_38]: So I just want to throw that out to my colleagues.

1804
02:13:54,367 --> 02:14:01,091
[SPEAKER_38]: If there is support, maybe not this particular second, but maybe in January, is that workable?

1805
02:14:02,772 --> 02:14:03,572
[SPEAKER_38]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1806
02:14:03,632 --> 02:14:04,793
[SPEAKER_38]: Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

1807
02:14:06,328 --> 02:14:11,310
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that there's areas to agree and disagree, but this is something we agree on.

1808
02:14:11,710 --> 02:14:14,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, what we don't agree on is a timeline.

1809
02:14:14,371 --> 02:14:25,635
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that as one council who voted for this in the past, and knowing that it's something that needs to be done, like our zoning and many other things, historical issues.

1810
02:14:25,675 --> 02:14:30,477
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that this is important, but I think right now, I think there's so much that supersedes it.

1811
02:14:30,497 --> 02:14:34,939
[SPEAKER_11]: That if it is offered sometime in the next fiscal year, it'll be something that I will totally

1812
02:14:35,899 --> 02:14:37,881
[SPEAKER_11]: support again, so I thank you, Mr. President.

1813
02:14:39,242 --> 02:14:40,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1814
02:14:42,205 --> 02:14:43,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Bears.

1815
02:14:43,686 --> 02:14:44,587
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1816
02:14:45,027 --> 02:14:46,169
[SPEAKER_34]: And I hear what people are saying.

1817
02:14:46,189 --> 02:14:50,553
[SPEAKER_34]: I just think this is the part where it's not, we're not, the city of Benford is not focused on it.

1818
02:14:50,573 --> 02:14:52,354
[SPEAKER_34]: This is, we're asking the permission from the state.

1819
02:14:52,755 --> 02:14:58,280
[SPEAKER_34]: We've known how long it can take on a variety of home rule petitions that this council has sent in the past that have never been heard.

1820
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:05,585
[SPEAKER_34]: I think we are advantaged by sending it sooner rather than later, trying to get the legislature to move on it.

1821
02:15:05,705 --> 02:15:11,590
[SPEAKER_34]: Because I think if we send it, I'll vote for it now, I'll vote for it in January, I'll vote for it whenever it's on the agenda.

1822
02:15:12,150 --> 02:15:18,455
[SPEAKER_34]: But if we send it in January, it could be the next January before they act on it, or they may never act on it at all.

1823
02:15:18,575 --> 02:15:24,759
[SPEAKER_34]: So I just think if we're talking about time, this is the part of the process where it's not,

1824
02:15:25,649 --> 02:15:26,690
[SPEAKER_34]: in the city of Medford.

1825
02:15:26,770 --> 02:15:31,352
[SPEAKER_34]: It's in the general court asking for the home rule petition.

1826
02:15:31,412 --> 02:15:40,676
[SPEAKER_34]: So I just think getting it up there sooner rather than later to try to move it along, it doesn't mean that this council can't focus on the many other issues that we have at hand.

1827
02:15:41,436 --> 02:15:43,777
[SPEAKER_34]: So that's just where I'm at.

1828
02:15:43,838 --> 02:15:44,178
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1829
02:15:45,238 --> 02:15:46,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1830
02:15:46,259 --> 02:15:46,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

1831
02:15:48,165 --> 02:15:56,251
[SPEAKER_42]: I do think it's also important to point out, for those that are so supportive of the measure, that if it goes forward tonight, you get two bites at the apple.

1832
02:15:56,531 --> 02:15:59,053
[SPEAKER_42]: because if it doesn't pass by January, then it gets refiled again.

1833
02:15:59,654 --> 02:16:02,716
[SPEAKER_42]: And if it does get passed before January, then you get charter commission.

1834
02:16:03,516 --> 02:16:10,461
[SPEAKER_42]: But I don't support the paper, but from an operational standpoint, if it got held until the end of the year or

1835
02:16:11,983 --> 02:16:16,007
[SPEAKER_42]: or tabled or whatever it may be, and it can't come back up for 90 days, so be it.

1836
02:16:16,047 --> 02:16:17,108
[SPEAKER_42]: The next session's in session.

1837
02:16:17,349 --> 02:16:19,391
[SPEAKER_42]: So you can send the paper to legislation now.

1838
02:16:19,411 --> 02:16:21,353
[SPEAKER_42]: If it doesn't get taken up for a vote, it doesn't get taken up for a vote.

1839
02:16:21,713 --> 02:16:27,179
[SPEAKER_42]: Then you want to do it again in January anyway when the circumstances change, you get another bite at the apple with a new legislature.

1840
02:16:27,599 --> 02:16:28,600
[SPEAKER_42]: So that's something to think about.

1841
02:16:28,760 --> 02:16:30,542
[SPEAKER_42]: But either way, I'm not going to support it this evening.

1842
02:16:30,983 --> 02:16:31,143
[SPEAKER_34]: Right.

1843
02:16:31,183 --> 02:16:32,905
[SPEAKER_34]: Well, Mr. President, if I may.

1844
02:16:33,145 --> 02:16:34,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Ike.

1845
02:16:34,606 --> 02:16:37,267
[SPEAKER_34]: And I think that that's kind of the point I'm trying to make, is let's send it up.

1846
02:16:37,327 --> 02:16:38,467
[SPEAKER_34]: If they approve it, they approve it.

1847
02:16:38,767 --> 02:16:44,149
[SPEAKER_34]: If we send it up now in this session, and if not, we're back in January, and then they can approve it in the new session.

1848
02:16:44,409 --> 02:16:53,212
[SPEAKER_34]: I just think we know exactly how difficult it is for the municipalities, whether it's Medford or most other municipalities, to get a home rule petition passed through the legislature.

1849
02:16:54,052 --> 02:16:54,872
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1850
02:16:55,432 --> 02:16:56,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1851
02:16:56,413 --> 02:16:58,333
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a number of people that want to speak on this issue.

1852
02:16:58,373 --> 02:17:02,955
[SPEAKER_06]: So at this point, I'm going to call on Matt H.

1853
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:05,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, Matt.

1854
02:17:07,363 --> 02:17:07,783
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, y'all.

1855
02:17:07,843 --> 02:17:11,727
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, my name is Matt Hughes, 76 Boston Ave.

1856
02:17:12,068 --> 02:17:15,912
[SPEAKER_17]: I would absolutely like to speak in favor of, oh, I'm sorry.

1857
02:17:15,932 --> 02:17:17,774
[SPEAKER_17]: Can y'all hear me?

1858
02:17:18,595 --> 02:17:20,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt, you said your last name's Hughes, right?

1859
02:17:21,097 --> 02:17:22,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Hughes, yeah.

1860
02:17:22,519 --> 02:17:22,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1861
02:17:23,059 --> 02:17:25,041
[SPEAKER_17]: No problem.

1862
02:17:27,574 --> 02:17:29,655
[SPEAKER_17]: So I am in favor of charter review.

1863
02:17:29,855 --> 02:17:32,015
[SPEAKER_17]: I have collected signatures in the past.

1864
02:17:32,075 --> 02:17:50,581
[SPEAKER_17]: Folks have mentioned this is something that many members of the community across a lot of different political stripes, to be perfectly honest, have done work to try and get our city into better shape with respect to our foundational documents.

1865
02:17:51,741 --> 02:17:57,866
[SPEAKER_17]: being reviewed, ideally getting back into a position where that document can be reviewed on a regular basis.

1866
02:17:58,587 --> 02:17:59,468
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be super great.

1867
02:18:00,368 --> 02:18:16,722
[SPEAKER_17]: Additionally, I think that I'm really glad that the mayor introduced this at this moment, because I think that this is an urgent moment to address very specific and concrete issues regarding the issues of race in Medford.

1868
02:18:17,663 --> 02:18:17,783
[SPEAKER_17]: So,

1869
02:18:18,644 --> 02:18:33,845
[SPEAKER_17]: There are many, many things that could come out of a process, but I know that one that there's going to be a lot of appetite from the community for is of ward representation in how we elect to the City Council.

1870
02:18:34,766 --> 02:18:35,507
[SPEAKER_17]: And that

1871
02:18:36,933 --> 02:18:43,638
[SPEAKER_17]: board representation could result in a lot more opportunity for West Medford to be diversely represented.

1872
02:18:44,979 --> 02:18:46,481
[SPEAKER_17]: So that- Point of information, Mr. President.

1873
02:18:46,741 --> 02:18:47,802
[SPEAKER_06]: That is- Matt, one minute please.

1874
02:18:47,862 --> 02:18:49,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

1875
02:18:52,805 --> 02:18:52,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1876
02:18:56,544 --> 02:18:57,144
[SPEAKER_38]: Councilman.

1877
02:18:57,365 --> 02:19:03,228
[SPEAKER_38]: I just want to clarify that the gentleman said regarding what representation and how we elect the city council.

1878
02:19:03,528 --> 02:19:07,851
[SPEAKER_38]: There's also an elected board called the school committee, and they are elected the same way as well.

1879
02:19:07,931 --> 02:19:15,556
[SPEAKER_38]: So I think when we talk about charter review, we have to be careful not to just isolate certain groups, Mr. President.

1880
02:19:15,836 --> 02:19:16,176
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1881
02:19:16,236 --> 02:19:17,777
[SPEAKER_38]: You are correct, Councilman.

1882
02:19:18,337 --> 02:19:19,238
[SPEAKER_38]: Matt, please continue.

1883
02:19:21,179 --> 02:19:21,840
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I agree.

1884
02:19:23,157 --> 02:19:36,749
[SPEAKER_17]: In any event, I think that the prospect that Councilor Knight brought up, the prospect that it should be done via grassroots means, especially during the pandemic, seems very counterproductive to me.

1885
02:19:37,149 --> 02:19:44,675
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that our community has actually banded together and there is a lot of volunteer activity being directed towards the public good right now.

1886
02:19:45,456 --> 02:19:50,140
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that if we want to maintain focus on what our, what folks should be,

1887
02:19:51,741 --> 02:19:53,261
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's a waste of our time and people actually need

1888
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:22,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Matt.

1889
02:20:22,240 --> 02:20:25,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, we have Jess Farrell.

1890
02:20:25,844 --> 02:20:27,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Jess, name and address for the record, please.

1891
02:20:28,466 --> 02:20:31,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Jess Farrell, 29 Martin Street.

1892
02:20:33,270 --> 02:20:40,897
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also like to encourage the council to move forward with a charter review.

1893
02:20:41,378 --> 02:20:45,101
[SPEAKER_01]: I also helped collect signatures for this effort in the past.

1894
02:20:46,415 --> 02:20:51,739
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel strongly about it for a lot of the same reasons that Matt already said.

1895
02:20:52,159 --> 02:20:57,002
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think that there's just a huge interest in the community right now for this.

1896
02:20:57,062 --> 02:20:58,503
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of energy behind it.

1897
02:20:58,543 --> 02:21:04,167
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that you should seize that moment right now when people are really interested in working on it.

1898
02:21:05,048 --> 02:21:08,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think that we discussed signs for about an hour and a half tonight.

1899
02:21:08,390 --> 02:21:12,953
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would have liked for that time to be spent on discussing things like charter reviews.

1900
02:21:14,389 --> 02:21:19,492
[SPEAKER_01]: to the Councilor who said that it wasn't an important enough subject to talk about right now.

1901
02:21:20,273 --> 02:21:24,435
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we should think about some of the other things that we spent a lot of time on tonight.

1902
02:21:24,635 --> 02:21:24,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1903
02:21:25,195 --> 02:21:25,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Jess.

1904
02:21:26,096 --> 02:21:28,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, Will Navar.

1905
02:21:30,338 --> 02:21:31,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Will, name and address for the record, please.

1906
02:21:33,407 --> 02:21:34,788
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm excited to learn about that.

1907
02:22:02,622 --> 02:22:05,083
[SPEAKER_16]: backlog of changes that need to be made.

1908
02:22:06,423 --> 02:22:10,004
[SPEAKER_16]: The sooner you get started, the easier it'll be to deal with.

1909
02:22:10,064 --> 02:22:13,805
[SPEAKER_16]: That doesn't mean it'll be easy, but let's not kick the can down the road.

1910
02:22:13,845 --> 02:22:16,426
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just a good governance thing, just like council first.

1911
02:22:16,446 --> 02:22:17,346
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1912
02:22:27,984 --> 02:22:28,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Diane Sullivan.

1913
02:22:29,565 --> 02:22:31,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Diane, if we could, I'm trying to unmute you now.

1914
02:22:31,726 --> 02:22:32,386
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1915
02:22:32,407 --> 02:22:34,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Could we please have your name and address for the record, Diane?

1916
02:22:35,708 --> 02:22:39,571
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, thank you, President Falco, Diane Sullivan, Jerome Street, and West Medford.

1917
02:22:40,171 --> 02:22:44,213
[SPEAKER_20]: I, too, just wanted to stand up in support of charter review.

1918
02:22:44,353 --> 02:22:48,235
[SPEAKER_20]: Just, you know, the other speakers before me spoke to the energy that's behind it.

1919
02:22:48,295 --> 02:22:52,398
[SPEAKER_20]: I really think it's about accountability and how we look

1920
02:22:53,118 --> 02:22:59,823
[SPEAKER_20]: to create a more equitable Medford that right now is the demand of so many of our residents.

1921
02:23:00,804 --> 02:23:07,169
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you in advance to the Councilors who are seeking to move charter review forward.

1922
02:23:07,189 --> 02:23:12,493
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a critical part of how we move forward in a more equitable way.

1923
02:23:12,914 --> 02:23:13,294
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1924
02:23:13,694 --> 02:23:14,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Diane.

1925
02:23:14,355 --> 02:23:18,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let's see here.

1926
02:23:26,069 --> 02:23:27,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I don't see any of the hands up.

1927
02:23:27,749 --> 02:23:27,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1928
02:23:32,370 --> 02:23:36,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Any of the councils have anything else that they want to state on this issue?

1929
02:23:37,532 --> 02:23:38,212
[SPEAKER_06]: We're missing one.

1930
02:23:38,232 --> 02:23:45,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, there's a motion on the floor and that motion was from Councilor Bears.

1931

1985
02:27:11,775 --> 02:27:14,957

[SPEAKER_06]: Board members strongly supported the proposal to allow breweries and brew pubs to operate in the city.

1994
02:28:21,037 --> 02:28:33,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Furthermore, given the fact that some other breweries in the region have become social gathering spots, the board respectfully suggests including the following language to provide additional flexibility to their operations.

1995
02:28:34,322 --> 02:28:38,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Add the following after the last line in the definition for brewery.

1996
02:28:39,003 --> 02:28:43,185
[SPEAKER_06]: The facility may also provide food that is produced on site,

1997
02:28:43,965 --> 02:28:49,706
[SPEAKER_06]: produced off-site or produced with food trucks that are located on-site.

1998
02:28:50,406 --> 02:28:52,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your consideration of this recommendation.

1999
02:28:52,727 --> 02:29:02,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Andrea LaRue, Chairman, and that was CC to Brianna Lungo, current Mayor, and to Kimberly Scanlon, City Solicitor, and to Paul Moki, the Building Commissioner.

2000
02:29:03,408 --> 02:29:10,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So at this point, I would declare the public hearing open, open to those in favor of the petition.

2001
02:29:11,010 --> 02:29:12,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Would anybody like to speak in favor?

2002
02:29:16,286 --> 02:29:21,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, John Costas, name and address for the record, please.

2003
02:29:23,071 --> 02:29:27,695
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, John Costas, 56 Hay Street, President of the Chamber of Commerce.

2004
02:29:28,275 --> 02:29:30,177
[SPEAKER_18]: We are in favor of the amendment.

2005
02:29:31,078 --> 02:29:32,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you, Mr. Costas.

2006
02:29:32,779 --> 02:29:39,404
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll give everyone a minute and a half, just because there's a lot of people on the call.

2007
02:29:39,764 --> 02:29:40,445
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I apologize.

2008
02:29:42,759 --> 02:29:45,381
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true, that's right, it's just favoring, yeah, I apologize.

2009
02:29:46,622 --> 02:29:52,407
[SPEAKER_06]: So those in favor, would anybody like to give their name and address to anyone that's in favor?

2010
02:29:52,427 --> 02:29:58,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2011
02:29:58,292 --> 02:30:03,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, clerk, I don't see anyone else.

2012
02:30:03,837 --> 02:30:04,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you?

2013
02:30:08,140 --> 02:30:09,962
[SPEAKER_28]: I do not, Mr. President, but I'm still looking.

2014
02:30:10,812 --> 02:30:11,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to double check to make sure.

2015
02:30:11,953 --> 02:30:13,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we got Max Heineck.

2016
02:30:13,113 --> 02:30:13,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, Max.

2017
02:30:15,874 --> 02:30:17,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Max, I'm trying to unmute you.

2018
02:30:17,715 --> 02:30:18,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

2019
02:30:20,176 --> 02:30:21,316
[SPEAKER_25]: My name is Max Heineck.

2020
02:30:21,396 --> 02:30:25,058
[SPEAKER_25]: I live with 5 Alden Road in Bedford, and I'm in favor.

2021
02:30:26,270 --> 02:30:50,345
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm the co-owner of Medford Brewing Company, and we would love the opportunity for ourselves or for other local breweries to come and be a part of the city and to create a gathering spot for Medfordians and to do so in a way that would bring new business, prosperity, peace, and joy to the neighborhoods.

2022
02:30:50,785 --> 02:30:51,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Max.

2023
02:30:55,851 --> 02:30:59,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's see, anyone else in favor of the petition that would like to speak?

2024
02:30:59,974 --> 02:31:12,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, hearing and seeing none, hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

2025
02:31:13,702 --> 02:31:15,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone opposed?

2026
02:31:15,223 --> 02:31:18,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anyone in opposition to the petition?

2027
02:31:18,325 --> 02:31:24,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2028
02:31:26,496 --> 02:31:29,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise, I don't see anyone here in opposition.

2029
02:31:35,127 --> 02:31:37,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

2030
02:31:37,711 --> 02:31:44,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Would anyone in the council like to discuss, Councilor Marks, do you have your?

2031
02:31:45,390 --> 02:31:46,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that from the last time?

2032
02:31:46,370 --> 02:31:47,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Your microphone's on, I didn't know.

2033
02:31:48,131 --> 02:31:50,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it was from last time, but I would like to speak, Mr. President.

2034
02:31:50,932 --> 02:31:55,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, one second, let me just, Councilor Marks, and then we have Councilor Knight after that.

2035
02:31:55,274 --> 02:31:57,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks!

2036
02:31:57,755 --> 02:32:13,821
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Mr. President, and the letter we received from the Community Development Board with their recommendation, I thought was already part of our brewery ordinance when we talked about the serving of food

2037
02:32:14,421 --> 02:32:19,302
[SPEAKER_38]: And the ability to produce on site or bring in food from off site.

2038
02:32:20,743 --> 02:32:23,864
[SPEAKER_38]: And also have food trucks on private property.

2039
02:32:24,764 --> 02:32:26,145
[SPEAKER_38]: I thought that was language we had.

2040
02:32:26,545 --> 02:32:30,986
[SPEAKER_38]: If it's not in there for some reason, I know this went back and forth with attorneys and

2041
02:32:31,406 --> 02:32:51,179
[SPEAKER_38]: Back and forth with the council, I strongly support adding the language that was recommended by the Community Development Board after the definition of brewery that states the facility may also provide food that is produced on site, produced off site, or produced with food trucks that are located on site.

2042
02:32:52,159 --> 02:32:55,241
[SPEAKER_38]: So I would ask that that be part of the ordinance, Mr. President.

2043
02:32:55,542 --> 02:32:55,922
[SPEAKER_38]: Second.

2044
02:32:55,982 --> 02:32:57,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so on the-

2045
02:33:01,406 --> 02:33:05,369
[SPEAKER_06]: So is your motion to adopt with the amendments?

2046
02:33:06,129 --> 02:33:06,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

2047
02:33:06,750 --> 02:33:06,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2048
02:33:07,910 --> 02:33:09,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk, do you have the language of the amendment?

2049
02:33:11,192 --> 02:33:14,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, basically to adopt the changes recommended by the city board, am I correct?

2050
02:33:14,695 --> 02:33:16,676
[SPEAKER_29]: To adopt the changes recommended by the city board.

2051
02:33:16,776 --> 02:33:16,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2052
02:33:18,277 --> 02:33:18,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2053
02:33:18,477 --> 02:33:22,540
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is the motion of Councilor Marks and that is seconded by Councilor Knight.

2054
02:33:23,700 --> 02:33:26,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see, we have Councilor Knight wanted to speak on this as well.

2055
02:33:27,202 --> 02:33:27,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

2056
02:33:28,967 --> 02:33:33,010
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, I'm glad that we're finally getting to the finish line on this proposal.

2057
02:33:33,050 --> 02:33:34,010
[SPEAKER_42]: It's been long overdue.

2058
02:33:34,350 --> 02:33:41,835
[SPEAKER_42]: I can remember filing the initial resolution asking Mayor Burke's staff to craft an ordinance some three and a half years ago, I believe.

2059
02:33:42,495 --> 02:33:46,017
[SPEAKER_42]: And in looking at the final product that we have here before us, I think it looks great.

2060
02:33:46,037 --> 02:33:57,544
[SPEAKER_42]: I do have concern, and one of the concerns, the only concern I have about it is the enforceability of the seven barrels and the ambiguity of the seven barrels.

2061
02:33:59,448 --> 02:34:06,726
[SPEAKER_42]: In the Seawind District, breweries operating with seven barrels or under would be allowed by right, and breweries operating with more than seven barrels would be allowable by special permit of the Board of Appeals.

2062
02:34:07,628 --> 02:34:12,612
[SPEAKER_42]: Well, who's the barrel police and what's the parameter?

2063
02:34:12,632 --> 02:34:15,855
[SPEAKER_42]: Is it seven barrels a day, seven barrels a week, seven barrels a month, seven barrels a year?

2064
02:34:16,595 --> 02:34:17,576
[SPEAKER_42]: I guess is my question.

2065
02:34:17,876 --> 02:34:22,400
[SPEAKER_42]: It's not going to prevent me from voting on the ordinance this evening, Mr. President, but I certainly think it's food for thought.

2066
02:34:23,141 --> 02:34:31,187
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't think that we're going to have somebody out there that's going to be the barrel police that's measuring liquid to see who serves seven barrels versus seven and a quarter or seven and a half or eight.

2067
02:34:31,808 --> 02:34:36,631
[SPEAKER_42]: And I just don't see how that aspect of the ordinance is enforceable and what precludes somebody from

2068
02:34:37,492 --> 02:34:44,710
[SPEAKER_42]: applying for a special permit by right at seven barrels, but then going over the seven barrel.

2069
02:34:46,109 --> 02:34:51,773
[SPEAKER_42]: limit how are we going to know, how are we going to enforce, what's the parameters and standards that are going to be put in place.

2070
02:34:51,813 --> 02:34:53,595
[SPEAKER_42]: That's the only issue that I have, Mr. President.

2071
02:34:53,875 --> 02:34:57,398
[SPEAKER_42]: But this is taking too long for us to come to this point.

2072
02:34:57,478 --> 02:35:01,321
[SPEAKER_42]: So with that being said, if it does pose a problem, we can always take it up at a later date.

2073
02:35:01,861 --> 02:35:06,505
[SPEAKER_42]: But I do think that that's a deficiency in our ordinance here this evening.

2074
02:35:06,745 --> 02:35:07,986
[SPEAKER_34]: Point of information, Mr. President.

2075
02:35:08,598 --> 02:35:09,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2076
02:35:09,439 --> 02:35:10,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Bears.

2077
02:35:10,660 --> 02:35:15,744
[SPEAKER_34]: Just the seven barrels is actually the size of the brewing system, not the amount of beer produced.

2078
02:35:15,884 --> 02:35:18,766
[SPEAKER_34]: So I think, I don't know who the enforcement authority would be.

2079
02:35:18,786 --> 02:35:32,137
[SPEAKER_34]: I think that we could appoint multiple people who would otherwise be approving a license to review to make sure that it is a seven barrel system or not.

2080
02:35:34,459 --> 02:35:35,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

2081
02:35:37,637 --> 02:35:40,078
[SPEAKER_38]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

2082
02:35:41,298 --> 02:35:51,501
[SPEAKER_38]: So we do have an established look at commission, and I would think they would be the appropriate body to- Right, right, right, to be the enforcement authority.

2083
02:35:52,922 --> 02:35:59,824
[SPEAKER_38]: But I agree, and we have a fishing industry, and you can only catch a certain number of fish.

2084
02:36:00,584 --> 02:36:03,606
[SPEAKER_38]: We don't have state or federal officials on the boats.

2085
02:36:04,166 --> 02:36:09,349
[SPEAKER_38]: They have a quota that they're allowed to get, and it's on an honor system, and they keep track of it and so forth.

2086
02:36:09,709 --> 02:36:11,170
[SPEAKER_38]: And I would see this as no difference.

2087
02:36:11,690 --> 02:36:20,435
[SPEAKER_38]: If there is a limitation on what can be produced or the size or whatever it is, that would be the case in this as well, Mr. President.

2088
02:36:21,135 --> 02:36:22,116
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2089
02:36:23,156 --> 02:36:25,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

2090
02:36:27,619 --> 02:36:29,460
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have one person that wants to speak.

2091
02:36:31,603 --> 02:36:32,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2092
02:36:32,884 --> 02:36:33,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

2093
02:36:36,148 --> 02:36:37,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record.

2094
02:36:38,530 --> 02:36:41,252
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Nick Belythe of 20 Dutton Circle.

2095
02:36:43,414 --> 02:36:46,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Nick, do you have a minute and a half?

2096
02:36:47,038 --> 02:36:50,061
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry, I'm having some Zoom issues amongst many other things.

2097
02:36:50,081 --> 02:36:50,441
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't worry.

2098
02:36:51,809 --> 02:37:14,925
[SPEAKER_24]: Just to address Councilor Knight's concern, the way with alcohol creation basically you're making it, the TTP, basically the government, when you put together a brewing system, you actually have a monitoring set up so the government gets their taxes for everything, and that directly is

2099
02:37:15,365 --> 02:37:17,689
[SPEAKER_24]: how you gauge the volume of beer produced.

2100
02:37:18,130 --> 02:37:21,595
[SPEAKER_24]: So there is an ordinance which is set up, so- Nick, one minute.

2101
02:37:21,615 --> 02:37:23,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

2102
02:37:23,518 --> 02:37:25,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight, one minute.

2103
02:37:25,021 --> 02:37:25,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me get your microphone.

2104
02:37:26,676 --> 02:37:32,758
[SPEAKER_42]: I certainly can appreciate the gentleman seeing through the trees to see the forest.

2105
02:37:32,818 --> 02:37:35,739
[SPEAKER_42]: It was about taxation and how we were going to recuperate money.

2106
02:37:35,780 --> 02:37:40,281
[SPEAKER_42]: And I'm confident that we'll be all right moving forward with the languages here.

2107
02:37:41,102 --> 02:37:46,324
[SPEAKER_42]: So with that being said, but it was more about how we're going to be able to monitor it because it's a revenue generating issue as well.

2108
02:37:46,364 --> 02:37:49,845
[SPEAKER_42]: So his astute business mind picked up on that relatively quickly.

2109
02:37:51,118 --> 02:37:51,958
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2110
02:37:52,058 --> 02:38:01,261
[SPEAKER_24]: As I said, when a brewing system is set up, you actually have a specific tank that is set up with the TTP, which is the government body for taxation of alcohol.

2111
02:38:01,721 --> 02:38:04,422
[SPEAKER_24]: And that monitors the volume of beer that's produced through the system.

2112
02:38:05,042 --> 02:38:13,364
[SPEAKER_24]: And that is then the checks and balances, because Uncle Sam wants to make sure he gets all the money they deserve and they want.

2113
02:38:13,584 --> 02:38:14,444
[SPEAKER_34]: Uncle Adam does, too.

2114
02:38:14,504 --> 02:38:17,225
[SPEAKER_34]: You can count me as an Uncle Zach.

2115
02:38:19,806 --> 02:38:20,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Nick.

2116
02:38:21,670 --> 02:38:23,271
[SPEAKER_31]: All right, thank you.

2117
02:38:24,191 --> 02:38:25,812
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll be quiet now.

2118
02:38:26,452 --> 02:38:27,493
[SPEAKER_06]: No worries, thank you.

2119
02:38:28,433 --> 02:38:32,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's see, so there is a motion on the floor.

2120
02:38:33,955 --> 02:38:36,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing that there's no one else has a hand up, so.

2121
02:38:37,077 --> 02:38:37,677
[SPEAKER_34]: Second the motion.

2122
02:38:37,697 --> 02:38:40,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion on the floor, there is a motion on the floor.

2123
02:38:40,098 --> 02:38:45,100
[SPEAKER_06]: That motion was by Councilor Marks, and it was seconded by Councilor Knight.

2124
02:38:46,321 --> 02:38:48,762
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was- As amended motion, yeah.

2125
02:38:48,822 --> 02:38:50,763
[SPEAKER_06]: As amended by Councilor Marks to

2126
02:38:52,079 --> 02:38:55,682
[SPEAKER_38]: Include the language from the CD board as recommended.

2127
02:38:57,043 --> 02:38:58,925
[SPEAKER_06]: On that motion, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

2128
02:39:02,288 --> 02:39:03,569
[SPEAKER_29]: It is to adopt as amended.

2129
02:39:04,310 --> 02:39:04,570
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

2130
02:39:06,251 --> 02:39:07,032

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2142
02:39:20,958 --> 02:39:23,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 on the negative.

2143
02:39:23,741 --> 02:39:24,962
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

2144
02:39:29,967 --> 02:39:32,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, notice of a public hearing.

2145
02:39:32,669 --> 02:39:36,453
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-042, legal notice.

2146
02:39:36,473 --> 02:39:40,317
[SPEAKER_06]: City of Medford, Massachusetts, Medford City Council, Chapter 94, zoning.

2147
02:39:42,585 --> 02:39:46,688
[SPEAKER_06]: This here is a, let's see, this is a continuation, I believe.

2148
02:39:46,948 --> 02:39:54,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, this is a continued hearing that we had previously with regard to the Marijuana Ordinance.

2149
02:39:55,613 --> 02:39:58,435
[SPEAKER_06]: We had met actually numerous times.

2150
02:39:58,855 --> 02:40:00,276
[SPEAKER_06]: It came back from the CD board.

2151
02:40:00,296 --> 02:40:07,381
[SPEAKER_06]: We met numerous times with Jonathan Silverstein from KP Law and

2152
02:40:08,615 --> 02:40:13,837
[SPEAKER_06]: We met with regard to the marijuana CAC ordinance and the marijuana ordinance.

2153
02:40:14,577 --> 02:40:23,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I have to note that in the agenda here, we have- 

2153
02:40:14,577 --> 02:40:23,240
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, a motion to sever the CAC ordinance from the zoning ordinance.

2154
02:40:23,260 --> 02:40:23,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2155
02:40:23,800 --> 02:40:24,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so- Second.

2156
02:40:26,226 --> 02:40:30,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight has made a motion to sever the ordinances because they were supposed to be severed.

2157
02:40:30,270 --> 02:40:33,633
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a typo in the agenda, and they were included all in one.

2158
02:40:33,713 --> 02:40:43,141
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion to, so if you go to page four, four through page ten is the CAC ordinance.

2159
02:40:43,821 --> 02:40:46,944
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the marijuana ordinance starts from page ten down.

2160
02:40:47,685 --> 02:40:51,929
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight to sever the ordinances, seconded by.

2161
02:40:52,876 --> 02:40:53,256
[SPEAKER_18]: Second.

2162
02:40:53,837 --> 02:40:56,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears, Clark Hurtubise, please call the roll.

2163
02:40:57,499 --> 02:40:58,099
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears.

2164
02:40:58,239 --> 02:40:58,559
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2165
02:40:59,720 --> 02:41:00,640
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello.

2166
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:01,160
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2167
02:41:02,121 --> 02:41:02,661
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight.

2168
02:41:02,821 --> 02:41:03,101
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2169
02:41:03,121 --> 02:41:04,402
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks.

2170
02:41:04,722 --> 02:41:05,063
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2171
02:41:05,743 --> 02:41:06,383
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell.

2172
02:41:06,663 --> 02:41:06,944
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2173
02:41:07,704 --> 02:41:08,564
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2174
02:41:08,744 --> 02:41:08,985
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2175
02:41:09,745 --> 02:41:10,465
[SPEAKER_29]: President Falco.

2176
02:41:10,886 --> 02:41:11,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2177
02:41:11,206 --> 02:41:12,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

2178
02:41:12,927 --> 02:41:13,987
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

2179
02:41:14,147 --> 02:41:14,788
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President.

2180
02:41:16,268 --> 02:41:17,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

2181
02:41:18,123 --> 02:41:34,226
[SPEAKER_42]: In review of the selection committee ordinance, I see that our esteemed counsel from KP Law has failed to include the local 3% tax option language that was requested of him on multiple occasions.

2182
02:41:35,367 --> 02:41:46,689
[SPEAKER_42]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd make a motion to amend the CAC ordinance to have the city solicitor, not KP Law, as previously asked multiple times, but our city solicitor,

2183
02:41:47,540 --> 02:41:58,248
[SPEAKER_42]: to draft language to include the local 3% tax option to generate revenues for the city as an impact.

2184
02:41:58,768 --> 02:41:59,108
[SPEAKER_42]: Second.

2185
02:42:01,710 --> 02:42:08,055
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, on the motion of Councilor Knight, do you have the language to that Councilor Knight's motion?

2186
02:42:10,377 --> 02:42:14,340
[SPEAKER_29]: He's asking the city solicitor and not KP Law

2187
02:42:17,059 --> 02:42:21,142
[SPEAKER_29]: To draft language to include the local 3% tax option to generate revenue for the city.

2188
02:42:21,763 --> 02:42:25,225
[SPEAKER_41]: As previously directed to KP law on multiple occasions and it never got in there.

2189
02:42:25,265 --> 02:42:26,046
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, that's correct.

2190
02:42:30,469 --> 02:42:35,653
[SPEAKER_06]: So on that motion by Councilor Knight, that is seconded by Councilor Bears.

2191
02:42:36,894 --> 02:42:37,995
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to speak up?

2192
02:42:39,235 --> 02:42:39,536
[SPEAKER_06]: You good?

2193
02:42:41,297 --> 02:42:43,699
[SPEAKER_06]: So on that motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Bears.

2194
02:42:46,997 --> 02:42:48,698
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't see any hands up, so I think we're good there.

2195
02:42:48,718 --> 02:42:49,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Any councilors want to speak?

2196
02:42:49,979 --> 02:42:52,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President?

2197
02:42:52,120 --> 02:42:53,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks, one second please.

2198
02:42:53,681 --> 02:42:54,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

2199
02:42:57,244 --> 02:42:58,224
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2200
02:42:58,304 --> 02:43:04,368
[SPEAKER_38]: I'd be remiss if I did not thank the subcommittee for their work on this ordinance.

2201
02:43:05,089 --> 02:43:12,774
[SPEAKER_38]: This was countless meetings over a long period of time, and a lot of time and effort.

2202
02:43:13,374 --> 02:43:14,436
[SPEAKER_38]: went into this ordinance.

2203
02:43:15,337 --> 02:43:20,765
[SPEAKER_38]: I realize that many other communities have come out with their ordinance.

2204
02:43:21,345 --> 02:43:29,877
[SPEAKER_38]: But let me tell you, this was crafted in a way that I feel comfortable and residents of this community should feel comfortable that there are many safeguards in place.

2205
02:43:30,798 --> 02:43:36,320
[SPEAKER_38]: in this ordinance, Mr. President, that protects neighborhoods, protects residents of this community.

2206
02:43:36,660 --> 02:43:49,964
[SPEAKER_38]: It was a thoughtful ordinance that was put together, and I want to thank Chairman Knight and Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Caraviello for their countless hours on putting this together, Mr. President.

2207
02:43:50,324 --> 02:43:52,205
[SPEAKER_38]: This doesn't happen by chance.

2208
02:43:52,685 --> 02:43:56,406
[SPEAKER_38]: This happens by work, and I appreciate my colleagues' work on this.

2209
02:43:57,426 --> 02:43:58,486
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2210
02:43:58,546 --> 02:43:59,007
[SPEAKER_34]: Mr. President.

2211
02:43:59,427 --> 02:43:59,987
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh, sorry.

2212
02:44:03,895 --> 02:44:06,757
[SPEAKER_02]: He was originally on the committee back five years ago.

2213
02:44:06,777 --> 02:44:07,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2214
02:44:08,118 --> 02:44:08,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2215
02:44:19,899 --> 02:44:21,740
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate Councilman Marks bringing that forward.

2216
02:44:21,760 --> 02:44:29,688
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, what people don't see behind the scenes is the work that Councilman Knight puts in when the camera's not on him.

2217
02:44:29,728 --> 02:44:34,012
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that all the questions we had during those

2218
02:44:35,273 --> 02:44:40,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Those meetings and before those meetings, it was always Councilor Knight that was the go-to guy.

2219
02:44:40,277 --> 02:44:51,505
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that he put in the hours and effort to really make us shine finally and get this through and moving it forward.

2220
02:44:51,545 --> 02:44:56,809
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a lot of good reasons why we need this, whether you believe in it or not.

2221
02:44:57,309 --> 02:45:01,873
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, we appreciate your work, Councilor Knight, and thank you again.

2222
02:45:03,629 --> 02:45:04,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor.

2223
02:45:04,389 --> 02:45:05,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Scarpelli, Council of Mayors.

2224
02:45:06,151 --> 02:45:08,332
[SPEAKER_34]: I want to echo the thanks of my colleagues.

2225
02:45:09,092 --> 02:45:15,236
[SPEAKER_34]: And if Councilor Knight is amenable, could we also amend this motion to also be a motion to table?

2226
02:45:15,276 --> 02:45:16,757
[SPEAKER_34]: So we only have to take one roll call vote.

2227
02:45:18,738 --> 02:45:19,098
[SPEAKER_34]: All good?

2228
02:45:20,679 --> 02:45:21,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sure.

2229
02:45:21,780 --> 02:45:22,680
[SPEAKER_34]: Whichever date you prefer.

2230
02:45:23,081 --> 02:45:24,161
[SPEAKER_06]: October 6th or is that?

2231
02:45:25,082 --> 02:45:25,402
[SPEAKER_34]: Great.

2232
02:45:25,762 --> 02:45:29,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2233
02:45:29,885 --> 02:45:31,746
[SPEAKER_06]: One second, Councilor, Vice President Caraviello.

2234
02:45:37,409 --> 02:45:39,030
[SPEAKER_34]: I was just referring to the CAC.

2235
02:45:44,955 --> 02:45:45,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Villes.

2236
02:45:45,876 --> 02:45:46,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello.

2237
02:45:46,917 --> 02:45:47,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I apologize.

2238
02:45:47,758 --> 02:45:49,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear what Councilor Villes said.

2239
02:45:49,319 --> 02:45:50,500
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could repeat it, I'd appreciate it.

2240
02:45:51,341 --> 02:45:51,801
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh, sorry.

2241
02:45:51,821 --> 02:46:00,449
[SPEAKER_34]: I was saying that if we could make a motion to amend amendment to Councilor Knight's motion so that we table it to a date certain so we only have to take one roll call vote.

2242
02:46:00,929 --> 02:46:02,831
[SPEAKER_34]: And that's just for the CAC, not for the zoning.

2243
02:46:05,506 --> 02:46:06,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

2244
02:46:06,146 --> 02:46:07,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Would any of the councils like to speak on this?

2245
02:46:09,927 --> 02:46:11,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

2246
02:46:11,808 --> 02:46:12,548
[SPEAKER_06]: We just need a minute.

2247
02:46:12,568 --> 02:46:14,129
[SPEAKER_06]: The clerk had to step away for a second.

2248
02:46:14,169 --> 02:46:19,991
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so thank you everyone for your hard work on this.

2249
02:46:20,111 --> 02:46:27,993
[SPEAKER_06]: This was definitely a lot of time, a lot of time, effort and energy went into this, actually into both ordinances.

2250
02:46:28,053 --> 02:46:30,434
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you to everyone that was involved.

2251
02:46:30,454 --> 02:46:31,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate it.

2252
02:46:32,575 --> 02:46:33,015
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will,

2253
02:46:34,551 --> 02:46:35,992
[SPEAKER_06]: We checked away for the clerk to get back.

2254
02:46:36,072 --> 02:46:37,193
[SPEAKER_06]: He should be back in a minute.

2255
02:46:38,694 --> 02:46:40,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you everyone for your patience.

2256
02:46:44,459 --> 02:46:48,542
[SPEAKER_39]: Mr. President, can I be so bold as to offer a motion to waive the reading of the paper?

2257
02:46:51,725 --> 02:47:01,172
[SPEAKER_16]: You make one big motion.

2258
02:47:04,346 --> 02:47:04,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clark.

2259
02:47:04,866 --> 02:47:09,467
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, Mr. President.

2260
02:47:09,827 --> 02:47:21,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so, let's see, Councilor Bierce had a motion to table, bless you, to table this to a date certain October 6th.

2261
02:47:24,070 --> 02:47:26,651
[SPEAKER_34]: As an amendment to Councilor Knight's motion to request.

2262
02:47:27,031 --> 02:47:29,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, okay, so the main motion was basically to,

2263
02:47:31,345 --> 02:47:32,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I think you have.

2264
02:47:32,025 --> 02:47:35,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have the main motion as far as sending this to the city solicitor?

2265
02:47:35,428 --> 02:47:35,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2266
02:47:36,328 --> 02:47:36,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2267
02:47:37,309 --> 02:47:41,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And the amendment was to table to a date certain of October 6th.

2268
02:47:42,412 --> 02:47:42,672
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes.

2269
02:47:42,893 --> 02:47:46,935
[SPEAKER_34]: And if required, I'd happy to make further amendment to waive the reading.

2270
02:47:50,758 --> 02:47:52,999
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't know if that's required or not.

2271
02:47:54,160 --> 02:47:55,381
[SPEAKER_34]: You didn't read the 10 page.

2272
02:48:01,704 --> 02:48:02,124
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

2273
02:48:06,925 --> 02:48:08,826
[SPEAKER_06]: We can read it when it comes back.

2274
02:48:09,106 --> 02:48:09,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

2275
02:48:09,806 --> 02:48:10,786
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably the best bet.

2276
02:48:10,886 --> 02:48:11,186
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2277
02:48:11,946 --> 02:48:12,987
[SPEAKER_06]: If that's okay with everyone here.

2278
02:48:13,467 --> 02:48:14,407
[SPEAKER_25]: I just don't want to make you read it.

2279
02:48:17,088 --> 02:48:19,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I mean, I don't want to read it if it's rough.

2280
02:48:21,089 --> 02:48:21,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I read the zoning.

2281
02:48:21,709 --> 02:48:22,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Not the CAC.

2282
02:48:22,029 --> 02:48:22,349
[SPEAKER_06]: The zoning only.

2283
02:48:27,614 --> 02:48:28,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I read all 17.

2284
02:48:28,274 --> 02:48:33,617
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President, you did read all 17 pages of the zoning ordinance at one point.

2285
02:48:33,637 --> 02:48:35,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I remember that.

2286
02:48:36,919 --> 02:48:37,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I do too.

2287
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:38,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Scott.

2288
02:48:40,021 --> 02:48:40,401
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

2289
02:48:40,741 --> 02:48:47,064
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of, so this is with regard to the CAC ordinance.

2290
02:48:47,084 --> 02:48:50,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you just read back the motion so we don't have it, Clerk Rodriguez?

2291
02:48:51,207 --> 02:48:51,407
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2292
02:48:52,367 --> 02:48:53,688
[SPEAKER_29]: Council night's original motion

2293
02:48:55,049 --> 02:49:07,474
[SPEAKER_29]: You move to have the city solicitor and not KP draft language to include the local 3% tax option to generate revenue for the city as previously directed to KP law on multiple occasions.

2294
02:49:09,495 --> 02:49:14,677
[SPEAKER_29]: And then council bears amendment was to move the table to a date certain, October 6th.

2295
02:49:14,858 --> 02:49:15,478
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes, the CAC.

2296

[SPEAKER_34]: The CAC.

2297
02:49:15,858 --> 02:49:17,979
[SPEAKER_29]: OK, so on that.

2298
02:49:19,560 --> 02:49:22,561

[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2329
02:50:17,098 --> 02:50:18,058
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello?

2330
02:50:18,238 --> 02:50:18,439
Yes.

2331
02:50:19,479 --> 02:50:20,059
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight?

2332
02:50:20,119 --> 02:50:20,259
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2333
02:50:23,404 --> 02:50:23,884
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight?

2334
02:50:24,685 --> 02:50:25,626
[SPEAKER_06]: He said- Yes.

2335
02:50:26,386 --> 02:50:27,547
[SPEAKER_29]: All right, Councilor Marks?

2336
02:50:27,867 --> 02:50:28,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2337
02:50:28,888 --> 02:50:29,569
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell?

2338
02:50:29,809 --> 02:50:30,089
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2339
02:50:31,050 --> 02:50:31,851
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2340
02:50:32,111 --> 02:50:32,371
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2341
02:50:33,132 --> 02:50:33,872
[SPEAKER_29]: President Falco?

2342
02:50:34,272 --> 02:50:36,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, seven affirmatives here and the negative, the motion passes.

2343
02:50:38,676 --> 02:50:43,019
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the continued public hearing that we had previously.

2344
02:50:43,600 --> 02:50:52,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said previously, we met with KP Law and KP Law basically gave us the final draft

2345
02:50:53,280 --> 02:51:01,230
[SPEAKER_06]: And the draft, KP Long gave us the final draft.

2346
02:51:02,291 --> 02:51:02,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Council Knight.

2347
02:51:04,273 --> 02:51:12,203
[SPEAKER_42]: Ultimately, Mr. President, just a brief synopsis on this paper authorizes marijuana dispensaries to be located in industrial and commercial two districts.

2348
02:51:12,985 --> 02:51:23,430
[SPEAKER_42]: It adopts the state statutory buffer zones and has a number of requirements and restrictions in place relative to border health, fire, police, security, safety, and the like, Mr. President.

2349
02:51:23,790 --> 02:51:28,952
[SPEAKER_42]: So with that being said, I think we've all talked this thing to death at this point, and I'd move for approval of the paper.

2350
02:51:28,972 --> 02:51:29,653
[SPEAKER_41]: Second.

2351
02:51:30,853 --> 02:51:35,595
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, for approval, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

2352
02:51:36,035 --> 02:51:37,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, one minute.

2353
02:51:37,336 --> 02:51:39,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anyone that wants to speak?

2354
02:51:42,755 --> 02:51:46,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not see anybody's hand up, if you can just reconfirm.

2355
02:51:46,998 --> 02:51:49,359
[SPEAKER_34]: Did we already do in favor and opposed?

2356
02:51:53,742 --> 02:51:55,083
[SPEAKER_34]: Did we already do the in favor?

2357
02:51:55,103 --> 02:52:02,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make sure if there was anybody that wanted to speak.

2358
02:52:04,089 --> 02:52:05,510
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President, I don't see any raised hands.

2359
02:52:05,571 --> 02:52:06,071
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, I don't either.

2360
02:52:06,488 --> 02:52:12,310
[SPEAKER_06]: On that motion, by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

2361
02:52:12,991 --> 02:52:13,811
[SPEAKER_29]: To approve the paper.

2362
02:52:13,831 --> 02:52:15,111
[SPEAKER_29]: So this is third reading?

2363
02:52:15,452 --> 02:52:15,812
[SPEAKER_29]: Correct.

2364
02:52:15,892 --> 02:52:16,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

2365
02:52:17,733 --> 02:52:18,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Third and final reading.

2366
02:52:20,314 --> 02:52:20,794
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears?

2367
02:52:21,894 --> 02:52:22,434
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears?

2368
02:52:23,015 --> 02:52:23,315
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

2369
02:52:24,755 --> 02:52:25,636
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello?

2370
02:52:25,656 --> 02:52:25,736
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2371
02:52:27,596 --> 02:52:28,157
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight?

2372
02:52:28,337 --> 02:52:28,637
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2373
02:52:30,117 --> 02:52:30,738
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks?

2374
02:52:31,058 --> 02:52:31,258
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2375
02:52:32,378 --> 02:52:33,079
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell?

2376
02:52:33,399 --> 02:52:33,619
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2377
02:52:34,906 --> 02:52:35,786
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2378
02:52:36,146 --> 02:52:36,386
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2379
02:52:37,347 --> 02:52:38,067
[SPEAKER_29]: President Falco?

2380
02:52:38,767 --> 02:52:38,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2381
02:52:39,627 --> 02:52:41,568
[SPEAKER_06]: 70 affirmatives, zero negative, the motion passes.

2382
02:52:45,689 --> 02:52:48,890
[SPEAKER_34]: May our ancestors of the temperance movement forgive us.

2383
02:52:50,090 --> 02:52:50,370
What?

2384
02:52:51,450 --> 02:52:53,451
[SPEAKER_16]: The people asked for it.

2385
02:52:56,650 --> 02:52:59,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

2386
02:52:59,412 --> 02:53:14,624
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-545 offered by Council and I be it resolved that the city clerk be directed to schedule and post a standing notice for a meeting of the ordinance subcommittee on the second Tuesday of October, November, and December from five to 6 p.m.

2387
02:53:15,125 --> 02:53:24,833
[SPEAKER_06]: for the purpose of reviewing the progress of draft ordinances requested by the city council and be it further resolved that the city solicitor be requested to attend these meetings.

2388
02:53:25,558 --> 02:53:26,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

2389
02:53:26,458 --> 02:53:27,719
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2390
02:53:27,959 --> 02:53:34,542
[SPEAKER_42]: Here we are, what, ten months into the year, and we have a number of ordinances that we've requested drafts of.

2391
02:53:34,562 --> 02:53:36,783
[SPEAKER_42]: We've gotten some back, we haven't gotten others.

2392
02:53:38,224 --> 02:53:51,690
[SPEAKER_42]: With the craziness that's going around with how government operates these days, with City Hall being half open and half closed, with the council being half open and half closed, I thought this would be a good opportunity for us to keep some of the items that this council's concerned about on the forefront, Mr. President.

2393
02:53:52,371 --> 02:53:55,032
[SPEAKER_42]: I know in the past, we've had situations where

2394
02:53:55,572 --> 02:53:58,254
[SPEAKER_42]: Papers get filed and then they kick around for quite a bit of time.

2395
02:53:59,054 --> 02:54:03,477
[SPEAKER_42]: For example, the marijuana ordinance that we just talked about that took five years to come to fruition.

2396
02:54:04,158 --> 02:54:10,862
[SPEAKER_42]: So with that being said, this is an effort as the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. President, to get our work product out and get it out in an expedient fashion.

2397
02:54:11,062 --> 02:54:14,604
[SPEAKER_42]: I think ten months to wait is plenty of time for us to request an update.

2398
02:54:15,145 --> 02:54:24,591
[SPEAKER_42]: And if we can sit down with the city solicitor and go over where we are and the progress that we've made on some of these items, I think we'll be able to put out even a better work product.

2399
02:54:25,251 --> 02:54:35,483
[SPEAKER_42]: This council's shown that it's been able to put out ordinances and has quite a vision for what the legislative body should be doing and for what legislative process should look like.

2400
02:54:36,024 --> 02:54:41,330
[SPEAKER_42]: And I just want to make sure, Mr. President, as the chairman of the subcommittee, that we're living up to the expectations of the residents here in the community.

2401
02:54:41,950 --> 02:54:44,592
[SPEAKER_42]: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support this measure.

2402
02:54:45,092 --> 02:54:54,458
[SPEAKER_42]: It would be three meetings, October, November, December, and the second Tuesday of each of those months for us to get a better handle on where we're at in the draft ordinance process.

2403
02:54:55,038 --> 02:55:00,221
[SPEAKER_42]: I've had the opportunity to speak with Solicitor Scanlon, and she's started to do legwork for some of this stuff.

2404
02:55:00,261 --> 02:55:03,083
[SPEAKER_42]: It's no reflection on the work of her office or that of the clerk.

2405
02:55:03,643 --> 02:55:10,107
[SPEAKER_42]: What it is, it's a reflection on this body and our willingness and desire to put out a favorable work product to the residents in this community.

2406
02:55:10,667 --> 02:55:13,228
[SPEAKER_42]: So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.

2407
02:55:13,668 --> 02:55:14,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2408
02:55:14,868 --> 02:55:15,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Bears.

2409
02:55:15,889 --> 02:55:16,769
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2410
02:55:17,229 --> 02:55:21,730
[SPEAKER_34]: I strongly support the resolution and hope we can move forward quickly.

2411
02:55:22,471 --> 02:55:29,833
[SPEAKER_34]: And I would just ask, it's not a motion or an amendment, just ask that none of these meetings supersede any committee of the whole meetings on the same proposed ordinances.

2412
02:55:31,073 --> 02:55:32,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

2413
02:55:33,254 --> 02:55:35,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other comments, questions from the council?

2414
02:55:38,936 --> 02:55:39,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone?

2415
02:55:40,103 --> 02:55:41,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone have the hand up?

2416
02:55:41,403 --> 02:55:43,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, nope.

2417
02:55:44,104 --> 02:55:46,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by?

2418
02:55:46,184 --> 02:55:47,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

2419
02:55:47,304 --> 02:55:49,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello, Clerk Redavis, please call the roll.

2420
02:55:52,226 --> 02:55:52,866
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears?

2421
02:55:54,346 --> 02:55:54,666
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2422
02:55:55,586 --> 02:55:56,586
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello?

2423
02:55:56,686 --> 02:55:56,966
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2424
02:55:58,067 --> 02:55:58,667
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight?

2425
02:55:58,867 --> 02:55:59,067
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2426
02:56:00,447 --> 02:56:01,067
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks?

2427
02:56:01,207 --> 02:56:01,487
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2428
02:56:02,528 --> 02:56:03,188
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell?

2429
02:56:03,468 --> 02:56:03,768
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2430
02:56:04,728 --> 02:56:05,548
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2431
02:56:08,589 --> 02:56:09,049
[SPEAKER_06]: He's absent.

2432
02:56:10,256 --> 02:56:11,717
[SPEAKER_29]: I can't hear Councilor Scarpelli.

2433
02:56:11,997 --> 02:56:12,858
[SPEAKER_06]: He stepped out of the room.

2434
02:56:12,938 --> 02:56:13,498
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, okay.

2435
02:56:13,898 --> 02:56:14,559
[SPEAKER_29]: President Selco.

2436
02:56:15,019 --> 02:56:17,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

2437
02:56:18,721 --> 02:56:19,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

2438
02:56:19,462 --> 02:56:29,648
[SPEAKER_06]: 2-0-546, after my council night, be it resolved that the city administration provide the council with monthly reports regarding the C-Click Fix program, including the following information.

2439
02:56:30,268 --> 02:56:33,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, number of total service requests reported.

2440
02:56:33,290 --> 02:56:35,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, number of total service requests resolved.

2441
02:56:36,252 --> 02:56:39,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Number three, a breakdown of what classifications of service was requested

2442
02:56:41,276 --> 02:56:44,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Stump removal, sidewalk repair, potholes, etc.

2443
02:56:44,645 --> 02:56:45,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Council night.

2444
02:56:51,016 --> 02:56:51,656
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Layton.

2445
02:56:51,696 --> 02:56:52,836
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2446
02:56:53,096 --> 02:56:57,197
[SPEAKER_42]: Since the C-Click Fix program has been implemented, I have offered this resolution annually.

2447
02:56:57,958 --> 02:57:09,240
[SPEAKER_42]: I feel as though it's very important that the council be provided with a breakdown of what types of requests are being made by our citizenry and whether or not they're being brought to a resolve that meets their satisfaction and expectation.

2448
02:57:09,940 --> 02:57:13,841
[SPEAKER_42]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'm requesting this data because data drive decision making.

2449
02:57:14,501 --> 02:57:24,973
[SPEAKER_42]: And when we can take a look at these C-Click fix requests, we might also be able to identify where our deficiencies lie in the deliverance of services here in the city.

2450
02:57:25,413 --> 02:57:35,124
[SPEAKER_42]: And then when the budget process rolls around, we have a better idea as to where we need to invest our funds to be sure that the taxpayers are receiving the level of services that they're so duly.

2451
02:57:37,084 --> 02:57:40,145
[SPEAKER_42]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask that my council colleagues support the measure.

2452
02:57:40,645 --> 02:57:43,866
[SPEAKER_42]: What it is, is it's a tool for us to gather data to be more informed.

2453
02:57:43,886 --> 02:57:51,268
[SPEAKER_42]: So when the budget process starts, we can have the opportunity to reallocate funds to those areas where we feel as though we can do better.

2454
02:57:52,208 --> 02:57:53,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2455
02:57:53,069 --> 02:57:53,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears?

2456
02:57:54,969 --> 02:57:56,389
[SPEAKER_34]: Second and move approval.

2457
02:57:56,409 --> 02:58:02,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Knight, second by Councilor Bears, I believe Jackie Peeks, did you want to speak on this?

2458
02:58:06,241 --> 02:58:09,382
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Councilor Marks.

2459
02:58:09,442 --> 02:58:10,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Jackie, then you can.

2460
02:58:10,882 --> 02:58:11,403
[SPEAKER_38]: Councilor Marks.

2461
02:58:12,343 --> 02:58:13,203
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2462
02:58:13,283 --> 02:58:15,764
[SPEAKER_38]: I want to thank my council colleague for bringing this up.

2463
02:58:16,444 --> 02:58:26,267
[SPEAKER_38]: I just want to make sure we have the correct terminology because I'm not sure if that system tracks items that are resolved.

2464
02:58:27,774 --> 02:58:36,059
[SPEAKER_38]: It may or may not, I think it will state whether they're closed or not, which doesn't necessarily reflect whether they're resolved or not.

2465
02:58:36,639 --> 02:58:51,688
[SPEAKER_38]: So maybe Jackie can expound on that, but I want to make sure if we're comparing apples to apples that, because I think it is a vital tool, as Councilor Knight mentioned, that this C-Click fix should be used during a budgetary process.

2466
02:58:52,168 --> 02:58:58,649
[SPEAKER_38]: So we can see the number one request and see what's happening in the community and use that as a budget tool.

2467
02:58:58,709 --> 02:58:59,870
[SPEAKER_38]: So I agree with that.

2468
02:59:00,130 --> 02:59:03,911
[SPEAKER_38]: I just want to make sure we're able to extract what we're looking for.

2469
02:59:04,931 --> 02:59:07,451
[SPEAKER_38]: So maybe it would be helpful to find out what the terminology is.

2470
02:59:08,151 --> 02:59:13,873
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, on that, I remember sitting back and we were talking about C-Click fix.

2471
02:59:13,933 --> 02:59:18,854
[SPEAKER_42]: And I believe it was a request that was made on DCR-owned property.

2472
02:59:21,054 --> 02:59:23,476
[SPEAKER_42]: been two previous administrations ago, maybe a previous administration ago.

2473
02:59:23,996 --> 02:59:30,539
[SPEAKER_42]: And the discussion was issue resolved, and the response was, that's state property, call the DCR.

2474
02:59:31,079 --> 02:59:33,361
[SPEAKER_42]: And that's the issue isn't resolved, the buck was passed.

2475
02:59:33,461 --> 02:59:38,883
[SPEAKER_42]: And I remember Councilman Marks bringing that up, because he got a call from a resident that wasn't too satisfied with the answer that they got.

2476
02:59:39,203 --> 02:59:42,325
[SPEAKER_42]: And it was mocked as resolved, but it really wasn't resolved, it was closed.

2477
02:59:42,605 --> 02:59:46,227
[SPEAKER_42]: So I certainly share your position on this, Council.

2478
02:59:47,196 --> 02:59:47,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2479
02:59:48,276 --> 02:59:52,798
[SPEAKER_41]: And I'll be happy to amend the paper any which way that meets that objective.

2480
02:59:53,518 --> 02:59:53,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Jackie.

2481
02:59:54,999 --> 02:59:56,299
[SPEAKER_33]: Jackie Peek from the administration.

2482
02:59:58,200 --> 02:59:59,761
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Councilor.

2483
02:59:59,781 --> 03:00:04,583
[SPEAKER_33]: So in terms of the current terminology that's used, I have to admit, I'm not 100% certain.

2484
03:00:04,623 --> 03:00:13,266
[SPEAKER_33]: But I did want to just let the council know, we are currently working on, I'm going to call a complete revamp of the program.

2485
03:00:13,906 --> 03:00:23,876
[SPEAKER_33]: So, you know, we'll certainly be able to provide information that we have on how, but in the next few months, that should be greatly improved in enough ways.

2486
03:00:23,896 --> 03:00:33,745
[SPEAKER_33]: Lisa Giuliani from the Mayor's Office is spearheading that and is working internally to sort of understand how the system is currently and how we can make it better.

2487
03:00:34,426 --> 03:00:37,729
[SPEAKER_33]: And we anticipate doing some testing to make sure that, you know,

2488
03:00:38,433 --> 03:00:56,308
[SPEAKER_33]: It's a truly solid product, and that we can follow up with constituents, just as you're discussing now, and really determining what the responses are, and if they're truly marked as resolved, and what that looks like, and sort of making it a complete loop of feedback.

2489
03:00:56,408 --> 03:01:00,852
[SPEAKER_33]: So, we anticipate that that will be rolled out as soon as we can.

2490
03:01:00,892 --> 03:01:03,374
[SPEAKER_33]: We're actively working with the QuickTrack format currently.

2491
03:01:06,693 --> 03:01:08,134
[SPEAKER_38]: Thoughts on the marks?

2492
03:01:08,454 --> 03:01:15,097
[SPEAKER_38]: So just to follow up, Jackie, what are the reported items that you can currently draw from now?

2493
03:01:18,081 --> 03:01:22,623
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't have it up on my screen, so I'd have to just bring that up.

2494
03:01:23,083 --> 03:01:24,504
[SPEAKER_33]: It covers a whole host of topics.

2495
03:01:24,604 --> 03:01:34,608
[SPEAKER_33]: I think one of the things that we want to sort of expand upon is we've asked departments who currently use the system to report to us how they're using it.

2496
03:01:34,709 --> 03:01:44,113
[SPEAKER_33]: So, you know, just making sure that the options that are available now are being utilized to the best of their ability and figuring out if there's ways that we can improve that.

2497
03:01:45,013 --> 03:01:45,754
[SPEAKER_33]: And then, like I said,

2498
03:01:47,165 --> 03:01:54,810
[SPEAKER_33]: some soft testing, understanding what members of the community would potentially like to see and how we can grow what's currently there.

2499
03:01:54,830 --> 03:02:05,098
[SPEAKER_33]: So, you know, there's quite a few options in there ranging from, you know, DPW and popular requests and things like that to health concern.

2500
03:02:05,438 --> 03:02:11,162
[SPEAKER_33]: But, you know, for example, reporting rodent activity and things like that.

2501
03:02:11,502 --> 03:02:15,585
[SPEAKER_33]: But what's there now, we're hoping to even expand upon further and make it a little bit more detailed.

2502
03:02:18,066 --> 03:02:22,507
[SPEAKER_38]: So just if I could, I don't want to belabor the point, but maybe if I pose it a different way.

2503
03:02:23,147 --> 03:02:32,269
[SPEAKER_38]: Currently right now, are you able to see within C-Click Fix, as Councilor Knight mentioned in his report, are you able to see if things are resolved?

2504
03:02:33,170 --> 03:02:34,570
[SPEAKER_38]: Or if they're just closed out?

2505
03:02:35,310 --> 03:02:36,511
[SPEAKER_33]: Or, you know.

2506
03:02:38,271 --> 03:02:41,052
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, so on the back end there we can see

2507
03:02:42,625 --> 03:02:46,287
[SPEAKER_33]: you know, a little bit more detail than is, I think, reported publicly at this point.

2508
03:02:46,307 --> 03:02:52,329
[SPEAKER_33]: But I'm going to check with Lisa and sort of see what is currently there and what can be reported out.

2509
03:02:52,369 --> 03:03:03,034
[SPEAKER_33]: But, you know, we, and I know that what's available to us, we also can sort of dig a little bit deeper and get, get reports on what's been resolved and sort of over how long of a period of time.

2510
03:03:03,054 --> 03:03:06,576
[SPEAKER_33]: So we can, we can certainly get a little bit of detail on the back end.

2511
03:03:09,872 --> 03:03:10,232
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2512
03:03:10,332 --> 03:03:10,572
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2513
03:03:36,892 --> 03:03:42,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Jackie, if I may, is there a list of reports that comes out of that system?

2514
03:03:44,672 --> 03:03:46,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Pre-made canned reports?

2515
03:03:48,993 --> 03:03:53,254
[SPEAKER_33]: Are you asking whether we have the ability to do it or whether we're currently reporting out on our mobile?

2516
03:03:53,454 --> 03:03:56,115
[SPEAKER_06]: No, whether or not the system has the ability.

2517
03:03:56,135 --> 03:04:02,776
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of systems, when you get them, they come with canned reports that give you different metrics each month.

2518
03:04:02,816 --> 03:04:12,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering if you have a list of reports that maybe come with it, so we could take a look at that list and maybe say, okay, these are things that we would want to see on a monthly basis.

2519
03:04:12,498 --> 03:04:12,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

2520
03:04:16,843 --> 03:04:26,865
[SPEAKER_33]: I guess, having it up in front of me, I'd have to double check on it, but I think that there's a report that we can run or create to provide data of some sort.

2521
03:04:26,945 --> 03:04:32,267
[SPEAKER_33]: I guess we'd want to know a little bit more about the kinds of specific data that you're requesting.

2522
03:04:32,307 --> 03:04:38,228
[SPEAKER_33]: I know one of them is whether or not things will resolve and what that actually means.

2523
03:04:38,808 --> 03:04:41,969
[SPEAKER_33]: But I think the short answer is yes, there is some sort of a report that can be done.

2524
03:04:43,052 --> 03:04:43,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

2525
03:04:44,393 --> 03:04:45,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks, do you have any questions?

2526
03:04:45,534 --> 03:04:46,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good, thank you.

2527
03:04:46,155 --> 03:04:47,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Councilor Knight, did you have any questions?

2528
03:04:47,876 --> 03:04:50,618
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't, I thank Councilor Marks for bringing up the point there.

2529
03:04:50,678 --> 03:04:53,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you, Councilor Knight.

2530
03:04:54,441 --> 03:04:55,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2531
03:04:55,362 --> 03:04:56,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions from the council?

2532
03:04:58,945 --> 03:05:01,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see anybody's hands raised, so I think we're good here.

2533
03:05:01,367 --> 03:05:06,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

2534
03:05:06,992 --> 03:05:08,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

2535
03:05:12,128 --> 03:05:12,728
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears?

2536
03:05:13,709 --> 03:05:14,009
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2537
03:05:15,210 --> 03:05:16,190
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello?

2538
03:05:16,390 --> 03:05:16,651
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2539
03:05:17,871 --> 03:05:18,392
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight?

2540
03:05:18,572 --> 03:05:18,792
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2541
03:05:19,812 --> 03:05:20,453
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks?

2542
03:05:20,633 --> 03:05:20,893
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2543
03:05:21,713 --> 03:05:22,354
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell?

2544
03:05:22,674 --> 03:05:22,914
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2545
03:05:23,675 --> 03:05:24,635
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2546
03:05:24,695 --> 03:05:24,855
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2547
03:05:25,756 --> 03:05:26,556
[SPEAKER_29]: President Falco?

2548
03:05:26,816 --> 03:05:27,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2549
03:05:27,197 --> 03:05:29,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Sending the affirmative during the night of the motion passes.

2550
03:05:32,619 --> 03:05:42,869
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-547, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the city administration provide the council with a monthly report on the issuance of street opening permits, including the following information.

2551
03:05:43,630 --> 03:05:44,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, date of issuance.

2552
03:05:44,951 --> 03:05:46,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, location.

2553
03:05:46,172 --> 03:05:47,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Number three, scope of work.

2554
03:05:48,479 --> 03:05:50,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Number four, date construction started.

2555
03:05:50,480 --> 03:05:52,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Number five, date construction was completed.

2556
03:05:52,561 --> 03:06:01,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Number six, if the permittee is required to return to the location after six months for final roadway restoration.

2557
03:06:01,884 --> 03:06:02,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

2558
03:06:04,305 --> 03:06:04,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Hang on.

2559
03:06:08,356 --> 03:06:09,737
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2560
03:06:10,017 --> 03:06:21,824
[SPEAKER_42]: The condition that our public utility providers and others that are offered street opening permits leave our streets in is something that's been a topic of conversation before this board for a number of years.

2561
03:06:22,705 --> 03:06:27,948
[SPEAKER_42]: Earlier this evening, for example, we had several grants of location and some of the things that we talked about were curb to curb.

2562
03:06:29,005 --> 03:06:32,369
[SPEAKER_42]: Paving, how long the project's going to take, where the project's going to be located.

2563
03:06:33,430 --> 03:06:42,240
[SPEAKER_42]: But I think, Mr. President, a lot of these times when we issue a street opening permit, and maybe it's not for a half a mile of roadway like we issued earlier today.

2564
03:06:42,280 --> 03:06:43,882
[SPEAKER_42]: Maybe it's only for 50 linear feet.

2565
03:06:45,063 --> 03:06:45,824
[SPEAKER_42]: It gets forgotten about.

2566
03:06:46,565 --> 03:06:48,126
[SPEAKER_42]: And that final restoration never happens.

2567
03:06:48,967 --> 03:06:57,652
[SPEAKER_42]: And we've seen places all over the community where we see trenches and patches and road work that's just fallen apart that our public utilities have performed.

2568
03:06:58,292 --> 03:07:03,476
[SPEAKER_42]: We've done a great job holding them accountable when they're coming before us for grants of location and things that are in our scope and our authority.

2569
03:07:04,056 --> 03:07:14,102
[SPEAKER_42]: But I think we can step it up a notch, Mr. President, and begin to look at the street opening permits when they're issued and what the follow-up protocols are to be sure that the taxpayers in the community and the residents in the community

2570
03:07:16,309 --> 03:07:21,871
[SPEAKER_42]: are afforded the opportunity to have their streets restored to the same condition that they were in prior to these construction and ground opening permits.

2571
03:07:22,891 --> 03:07:28,453
[SPEAKER_42]: When these ground opening permits are issued, it's usually for the purpose of underground utility work and underground utility upgrades.

2572
03:07:29,093 --> 03:07:33,455
[SPEAKER_42]: And these underground utility upgrades allow the city to generate

2573
03:07:34,176 --> 03:07:38,661
[SPEAKER_42]: the ability to assess a personal property tax on the underground infrastructure that's being placed.

2574
03:07:39,382 --> 03:07:51,756
[SPEAKER_42]: But this underground infrastructure that's being placed along with the personal property tax that the city can get also provides the utility provider with the ability to have more efficient operations and in turn increase their profits.

2575
03:07:52,837 --> 03:08:01,146
[SPEAKER_42]: So when we talk a lot about what's going on in the community and community benefits, we look at public utility providers that are very protected and very insulated through state law.

2576
03:08:01,907 --> 03:08:06,913
[SPEAKER_42]: That aren't leaving our streets and our roadways in a condition that a lot of us feel would be suitable and satisfactory.

2577
03:08:07,353 --> 03:08:19,240
[SPEAKER_42]: And this is an effort to make sure that this stays in the forefront, Mr. President, with the monthly report letting us know what roadways have been ripped up, when the construction took place, when the construction was completed, and what the plans are in the future.

2578
03:08:19,901 --> 03:08:22,922
[SPEAKER_42]: After six months, when they're going to get out there and get it done if they have to go there and do it.

2579
03:08:23,523 --> 03:08:28,786
[SPEAKER_42]: It also allows us the opportunity to monitor the list and make sure that after the six months is up that these roadways get restored.

2580
03:08:29,306 --> 03:08:31,468
[SPEAKER_42]: So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the paper.

2581
03:08:32,228 --> 03:08:32,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2582
03:08:33,829 --> 03:08:34,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions from the council?

2583
03:08:34,910 --> 03:08:35,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Any comments?

2584
03:08:37,635 --> 03:08:38,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello.

2585
03:08:41,598 --> 03:08:43,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2586
03:08:43,259 --> 03:08:45,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I thank my fellow council for putting this on.

2587
03:08:46,081 --> 03:08:54,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably one of the most amount of calls that we get is for street openings that never ever get repaired.

2588
03:08:54,988 --> 03:09:01,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if the permittee should be required to come back after six months.

2589
03:09:02,354 --> 03:09:10,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you can drive around the city and any street and you'll see sunken patches and don't worry, they're going to come back, they're going to come back.

2590
03:09:10,860 --> 03:09:12,401
[SPEAKER_02]: And the company never comes back.

2591
03:09:12,861 --> 03:09:15,983
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, this is something that's very important.

2592
03:09:16,003 --> 03:09:17,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I thank my council for putting it on.

2593
03:09:18,104 --> 03:09:22,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has gotten a little better under Tim McGiven.

2594
03:09:23,647 --> 03:09:26,028
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, I think we still have a long way to go.

2595
03:09:26,408 --> 03:09:28,450
[SPEAKER_02]: And I second this motion, a motion for approval.

2596
03:09:29,670 --> 03:09:30,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

2597
03:09:30,871 --> 03:09:33,752
[SPEAKER_06]: On a motion to council tonight.

2598
03:09:35,974 --> 03:09:36,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Schell?

2599
03:09:37,314 --> 03:09:37,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2600
03:09:38,215 --> 03:09:38,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

2601
03:09:39,821 --> 03:09:41,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpella.

2602
03:09:41,062 --> 03:09:49,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I appreciate Councilor Ike bringing this forward and this is a great initiative moving forward because I think Councilor Caraviello is right.

2603
03:09:49,748 --> 03:09:52,029
[SPEAKER_11]: But one thing that we've talked about and

2604
03:09:53,365 --> 03:10:01,731
[SPEAKER_11]: And in most other communities, if not all of the communities, they have, I know Councilor Marks has mentioned a thousand times, a clerk of works.

2605
03:10:02,391 --> 03:10:12,959
[SPEAKER_11]: That when there is any type of job, it's up to the city to make sure when that job is completed that there is someone there that signs off and then rechecks that in six months.

2606
03:10:14,500 --> 03:10:15,921
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's what we're lacking here.

2607
03:10:15,961 --> 03:10:19,143
[SPEAKER_11]: We're lacking that layer of follow through.

2608
03:10:19,243 --> 03:10:20,764
[SPEAKER_11]: So again,

2609
03:10:22,185 --> 03:10:24,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how we could move forward.

2610
03:10:24,306 --> 03:10:39,774
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that as we look as we move forward, and the tight budget's going to be even tighter, but I don't know if there's an avenue that our DPW director or our engineer can

2611
03:10:42,943 --> 03:10:48,386
[SPEAKER_11]: look into and find that person that's going to follow through with that.

2612
03:10:48,406 --> 03:10:55,391
[SPEAKER_11]: because I know with the short staff that we have, these things fall through the cracks.

2613
03:10:55,451 --> 03:11:07,499
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, I think that as we move forward looking for an effective way of having a clerk of the works that's going to follow through with these is going to be most effective, I think, than anything here.

2614
03:11:07,559 --> 03:11:09,160
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you, Mr. President.

2615
03:11:09,940 --> 03:11:11,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

2616
03:11:12,242 --> 03:11:18,048
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor, Vice President Caraviello, Clerk Cronin, please call the roll.

2617
03:11:21,031 --> 03:11:21,652
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears?

2618
03:11:21,952 --> 03:11:22,252
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2619
03:11:23,213 --> 03:11:24,214
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello?

2620
03:11:24,414 --> 03:11:24,735
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2621
03:11:25,556 --> 03:11:26,096
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight?

2622
03:11:26,196 --> 03:11:26,657
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2623
03:11:27,738 --> 03:11:28,318
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks?

2624
03:11:28,759 --> 03:11:29,019
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2625
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:30,581
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell?

2626
03:11:31,041 --> 03:11:31,301
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2627
03:11:32,362 --> 03:11:33,203
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2628
03:11:33,343 --> 03:11:33,563
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2629
03:11:35,244 --> 03:11:37,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 7 the affirmative, 0 the negative, the motion passes.

2630
03:11:37,687 --> 03:11:44,596
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-548 offered by Councilor Knight, being resolved that the City Auditor conduct an audit of the Treasurer Collector's Office.

2631
03:11:45,666 --> 03:11:47,166
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Knight.

2632
03:11:47,186 --> 03:11:48,467
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2633
03:11:49,967 --> 03:11:57,869
[SPEAKER_42]: I've gotten a number of calls surrounding accounting, billing, and collections practices in the Treasurer-Collector's office.

2634
03:11:58,289 --> 03:12:01,550
[SPEAKER_42]: When we sit there and we look at what's going on, we have no assistant Treasurer-Collector.

2635
03:12:02,070 --> 03:12:06,911
[SPEAKER_42]: We have a temporary Treasurer-Collector, a part-time Treasurer-Collector that's a retiree that's been brought back.

2636
03:12:07,667 --> 03:12:16,569
[SPEAKER_42]: So in the interest of financial transparency, Mr. President, and to address some of the concerns that have been raised by those in the community, I'd request that an audit be conducted for the first 10 months of the year.

2637
03:12:19,119 --> 03:12:28,402
[SPEAKER_42]: When we look at where we were this time a year ago, we had very, very, very aggressive collections under the previous administration.

2638
03:12:28,683 --> 03:12:38,266
[SPEAKER_42]: A lot of money came in through the collections process, Mr. President, and I just want to make sure that we're doing the best that we can to ensure that these dollars are being captured and spent wisely.

2639
03:12:40,126 --> 03:12:40,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2640
03:12:42,667 --> 03:12:43,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to speak?

2641
03:12:43,208 --> 03:12:46,569
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. President?

2642
03:12:49,142 --> 03:12:56,463
[SPEAKER_38]: Maybe if we can get an update from the city administration, I thought they did hire an assistant city treasurer.

2643
03:12:57,844 --> 03:12:59,324
[SPEAKER_38]: I thought that position was filled.

2644
03:12:59,844 --> 03:13:02,865
[SPEAKER_38]: But if we can get an update on that, there's been some transition in the building.

2645
03:13:03,505 --> 03:13:09,326
[SPEAKER_38]: And to be quite frank, we haven't received any correspondence on things that are going on within the building.

2646
03:13:09,686 --> 03:13:14,387
[SPEAKER_38]: There's been people that have left positions and we haven't received any formal communication.

2647
03:13:16,906 --> 03:13:22,828
[SPEAKER_38]: We can ask, Jackie should know that, but I thought they did bring on an assistant treasurer collector.

2648
03:13:26,329 --> 03:13:28,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Jackie, I'm trying to, there you go.

2649
03:13:28,070 --> 03:13:31,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Jackie, if you could please comment to Councilman Mark's question.

2650
03:13:33,431 --> 03:13:45,895
[SPEAKER_33]: Councilman Mark's point is, you know, there's been a few changes and updates, and I'm happy to have Dave provide a report or update some information to you when he's back in the office later this week or early next.

2651
03:13:47,588 --> 03:13:49,929
[SPEAKER_38]: What about regarding the assistant treasurer-collector?

2652
03:13:51,189 --> 03:13:54,511
[SPEAKER_38]: Has that position been filled?

2653
03:13:54,551 --> 03:14:02,773
[SPEAKER_33]: I haven't been directly involved in the hiring conversations, and I don't want to misspeak on that, so I do just want to double check on a couple of the things.

2654
03:14:02,793 --> 03:14:05,134
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, I can hopefully report back in just a bit.

2655
03:14:05,414 --> 03:14:07,055
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm just going to double check, if you don't mind.

2656
03:14:09,976 --> 03:14:11,076
[SPEAKER_38]: Mr. President, if I could?

2657
03:14:11,417 --> 03:14:12,217
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, Councilor Marks.

2658
03:14:13,311 --> 03:14:18,875
[SPEAKER_38]: That particular office, in my opinion, is in good hands.

2659
03:14:19,796 --> 03:14:36,309
[SPEAKER_38]: We have an acting treasurer-collector who was the former treasurer-collector for many, many years in this community and ran that office with the utmost respect and confidence and accounting methods.

2660
03:14:37,229 --> 03:14:39,972
[SPEAKER_38]: And I'm not sure what

2661
03:14:40,632 --> 03:14:51,386
[SPEAKER_38]: The need is to have a city auditor audit the treasurer collector's office, unless there's an issue of concern, because there is a yearly audit that does take place.

2662
03:14:52,027 --> 03:14:55,952
[SPEAKER_38]: And maybe we should be asking what the results were of the previous audit.

2663
03:14:57,194 --> 03:15:01,739
[SPEAKER_38]: But I'm not sure what this would, we have a great staff down there.

2664
03:15:02,100 --> 03:15:09,068
[SPEAKER_38]: They work very hard, and I'm not quite sure what this would accomplish, Mr. President.

2665
03:15:09,709 --> 03:15:11,351
[SPEAKER_38]: So I will not be supporting this tonight.

2666
03:15:11,571 --> 03:15:12,532
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2667
03:15:12,572 --> 03:15:13,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

2668
03:15:14,545 --> 03:15:21,030
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, I'd be happy to amend the paper to get three years of the last three years of the audits in that department to take a look at that.

2669
03:15:21,150 --> 03:15:24,713
[SPEAKER_42]: And then if there's any concern, I can pursue this paper at a future time.

2670
03:15:25,393 --> 03:15:30,938
[SPEAKER_42]: I'd ask the Councilor if that would satisfy his question and maybe allow him the opportunity to support this paper with that amendment.

2671
03:15:36,782 --> 03:15:38,503
[SPEAKER_42]: So often as a motion to amend Mr. President.

2672
03:15:43,186 --> 03:15:48,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilman, you're amending the resolution to look at the last three years?

2673
03:15:48,408 --> 03:15:50,609
[SPEAKER_41]: Last three years of the auditor's reports to the Treasurer-Collector's Office.

2674
03:15:52,570 --> 03:15:53,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise, do you have the wording?

2675
03:16:02,454 --> 03:16:03,075
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, Mr. President.

2676
03:16:03,415 --> 03:16:07,977
[SPEAKER_28]: The amendment is to get the last three years of audits for the Treasurer-Collector's Office.

2677
03:16:09,875 --> 03:16:13,518
[SPEAKER_34]: a point of information, point of information, point of information.

2678
03:16:15,340 --> 03:16:16,441
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a, uh, okay.

2679
03:16:16,461 --> 03:16:16,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2680
03:16:16,881 --> 03:16:17,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise.

2681
03:16:19,043 --> 03:16:24,267
[SPEAKER_06]: So on that motion of console night, seconded by seven seconds.

2682
03:16:25,488 --> 03:16:32,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by vice president Caraviello, uh, console beers, console beers as a point of information, console beers.

2683
03:16:33,215 --> 03:16:34,436
[SPEAKER_34]: Just a clarification.

2684
03:16:34,656 --> 03:16:37,318
[SPEAKER_34]: Would that amendment be instead of conducting a new audit,

2685
03:16:38,760 --> 03:16:40,161
[SPEAKER_34]: Strike and replace, got it, thank you.

2686
03:16:41,622 --> 03:16:42,082
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

2687
03:16:42,343 --> 03:16:43,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Caraviello.

2688
03:16:43,864 --> 03:16:46,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, if we could also amend that.

2689
03:16:47,967 --> 03:16:56,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember back in May, during the budget season, the chief of staff said we were on the verge of hiring a treasurer.

2690
03:17:00,055 --> 03:17:04,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we have an update on where we are with the hiring process of a new treasurer?

2691
03:17:04,058 --> 03:17:05,599
[SPEAKER_02]: A permanent treasurer?

2692
03:17:07,979 --> 03:17:17,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I have confidence in Mr. Pompeo, but it was said that we were ready to hire a new treasurer.

2693
03:17:19,804 --> 03:17:22,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so point of information, Counsel Knight.

2694
03:17:26,574 --> 03:17:36,226
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't want this to turn into a referendum on the qualifications or the abilities of Mr. Pompeo, but Mr. Pompeo is also limited to the number of hours that he can work as a retiree.

2695
03:17:36,647 --> 03:17:41,192
[SPEAKER_42]: So as a retiree in the public pension system, he's limited to 960 hours a year.

2696
03:17:44,286 --> 03:17:47,088
[SPEAKER_42]: If there's no assistant, then he's limited to 960 hours a year.

2697
03:17:47,448 --> 03:17:49,710
[SPEAKER_42]: That's why I raised the concern, Mr. President.

2698
03:17:49,750 --> 03:17:52,612
[SPEAKER_42]: But it's not a reflection of the duties or the work that he does down there.

2699
03:17:52,652 --> 03:17:57,035
[SPEAKER_42]: It's a reflection of the staffing levels down there and the level of productivity.

2700
03:17:57,656 --> 03:17:59,457
[SPEAKER_42]: But with that being said, I've amended the paper.

2701
03:17:59,497 --> 03:18:06,042
[SPEAKER_42]: I just don't want this to be turned into a referendum on Mr. Pompeo because that wasn't my intention in any way, shape, or form.

2702
03:18:06,638 --> 03:18:09,981
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I can offer in the form of amendment of where we are in the hiring of a treasurer.

2703
03:18:10,001 --> 03:18:17,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so an amendment by Vice President Caraviello to receive an update with regard to hiring a new treasurer?

2704
03:18:18,510 --> 03:18:19,050
[SPEAKER_43]: Of the treasurer.

2705
03:18:19,070 --> 03:18:24,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, do you have an amendment of Vice President Caraviello?

2706
03:18:25,517 --> 03:18:28,099
[SPEAKER_29]: Update of the hiring process for a permanent treasurer.

2707
03:18:28,200 --> 03:18:28,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

2708
03:18:31,545 --> 03:18:37,367
[SPEAKER_37]: I just want to make sure we're requesting the appropriate reports for the audit.

2709
03:18:38,227 --> 03:18:49,111
[SPEAKER_38]: So it's my understanding the independent audit that we hired, independent outside audit, comes in and audits City Hall yearly, so once a year.

2710
03:18:49,552 --> 03:18:50,992
[SPEAKER_38]: So that would be an independent audit.

2711
03:18:51,832 --> 03:18:55,934
[SPEAKER_38]: The auditor from the city does a monthly audit.

2712
03:18:56,997 --> 03:19:00,479
[SPEAKER_38]: So I just want to make sure whatever we're requesting is what we want.

2713
03:19:00,739 --> 03:19:05,622
[SPEAKER_38]: Do we want the independent audit that's done on a yearly basis, three years worth of that?

2714
03:19:05,982 --> 03:19:10,885
[SPEAKER_38]: Or do we want to look at three years worth of a monthly audit that's done internally?

2715
03:19:11,685 --> 03:19:13,226
[SPEAKER_38]: So I just want to make sure we're on the same page.

2716
03:19:14,961 --> 03:19:17,682
[SPEAKER_42]: Big picture of Mr. President would be the way that I'd like to look at it.

2717
03:19:17,742 --> 03:19:21,444
[SPEAKER_42]: Three years, 12 months in a packet, you know what I mean, is the way that I'd prefer it.

2718
03:19:21,764 --> 03:19:23,384
[SPEAKER_38]: From the independent audit?

2719
03:19:23,404 --> 03:19:25,585
[SPEAKER_38]: The independent audit, not the internal audit, yeah.

2720
03:19:25,605 --> 03:19:28,346
[SPEAKER_41]: Then we can take a look at those monthlies afterwards and see, you know.

2721
03:19:29,766 --> 03:19:30,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Locks.

2722
03:19:30,647 --> 03:19:31,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2723
03:19:31,527 --> 03:19:32,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears.

2724
03:19:32,828 --> 03:19:33,388
[SPEAKER_34]: I wouldn't mind.

2725
03:19:34,088 --> 03:19:36,409
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't see any harm in just asking for both up front.

2726
03:19:37,409 --> 03:19:39,450
[SPEAKER_34]: I'd like both if people are open to that.

2727
03:19:54,627 --> 03:19:55,868
[SPEAKER_34]: I just don't see any difference.

2728
03:19:56,448 --> 03:19:58,109
[SPEAKER_34]: If it's a lot, I'd like more time to read it.

2729
03:20:00,790 --> 03:20:01,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that an amendment?

2730
03:20:03,231 --> 03:20:07,173
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes, an amendment to receive both the independent audit and the monthly city audits.

2731
03:20:09,774 --> 03:20:12,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we have a further amendment by Council Beers.

2732
03:20:16,750 --> 03:20:21,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, any other questions or comments?

2733
03:20:25,796 --> 03:20:27,197
[SPEAKER_38]: Your microphone is now on.

2734
03:20:27,878 --> 03:20:37,967
[SPEAKER_38]: And we all received an email, I think it was about a week, week and a half ago, from a resident that was very concerned about his automobile excise tax.

2735
03:20:38,848 --> 03:20:44,193
[SPEAKER_38]: And he stated at the time that he usually gets a bill in the mail for his auto excise tax.

2736
03:20:44,754 --> 03:20:51,480
[SPEAKER_38]: This year he did not get the bill in the mail for his excise tax and therefore forgot to pay it and he got a surcharge.

2737
03:20:52,799 --> 03:21:02,790
[SPEAKER_38]: In addition to that surcharge, his wife, who the city goes into her account and automatically withdraws the excise, didn't go in.

2738
03:21:02,910 --> 03:21:12,020
[SPEAKER_38]: Supposedly, according to this resident, didn't go in and withdraw the amount for the excise tax from her account and it went in.

2739
03:21:15,442 --> 03:21:22,206
[SPEAKER_38]: they again charged a surcharge that wasn't her fault because the city was supposed to go in and remove the amount.

2740
03:21:22,467 --> 03:21:24,968
[SPEAKER_38]: I think I'm explaining the email correctly.

2741
03:21:25,028 --> 03:21:36,275
[SPEAKER_38]: So I think some of that issue, Mr. President, I'm hoping maybe we can resolve by asking maybe the acting treasurer collector regarding that particular incident.

2742
03:21:38,199 --> 03:21:45,163
[SPEAKER_38]: And if that's, because the email we got made it sound like it was a systemic problem throughout the community.

2743
03:21:45,523 --> 03:21:51,247
[SPEAKER_38]: And this was happening to lots of people throughout the community, and not an isolated incident.

2744
03:21:51,607 --> 03:21:52,868
[SPEAKER_38]: So I think that's important.

2745
03:21:53,429 --> 03:21:59,913
[SPEAKER_38]: Maybe as part of this paper, if Councilor Knight doesn't mind, we can ask that question directly to the Treasurer-Collector's Office.

2746
03:22:00,013 --> 03:22:01,554
[SPEAKER_39]: I'd be happy to support that amendment, Councilor.

2747
03:22:01,874 --> 03:22:03,575
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, so that's an amendment from Councilor Marks.

2748
03:22:05,572 --> 03:22:08,074
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President, I didn't get all the wording of Council Marks' amendment.

2749
03:22:13,399 --> 03:22:23,307
[SPEAKER_38]: That the treasurer collect a report back to the Medford City Council regarding a concern of excise tax in the community.

2750
03:22:24,548 --> 03:22:24,808
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay.

2751
03:22:25,329 --> 03:22:29,012
[SPEAKER_38]: And then I can elaborate more on, that's the general gist.

2752
03:22:29,893 --> 03:22:30,053
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

2753
03:22:35,165 --> 03:22:37,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, any other questions or comments from the council?

2754
03:22:37,488 --> 03:22:39,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2755
03:22:41,172 --> 03:22:50,763
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of council tonight, seconded by Councilor Marks, as amended by Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Bears, Councilor Marks.

2756
03:22:52,865 --> 03:22:53,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I miss anything?

2757
03:22:58,956 --> 03:23:05,742
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Knight amended the original motion, or original resolution as well.

2758
03:23:06,182 --> 03:23:07,103
[SPEAKER_28]: It was a strike and replace.

2759
03:23:07,483 --> 03:23:07,724
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

2760
03:23:08,504 --> 03:23:10,326
[SPEAKER_06]: On that motion, Clerk Curtis, please come along.

2761
03:23:13,869 --> 03:23:14,489
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears?

2762
03:23:15,370 --> 03:23:15,690
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2763
03:23:16,651 --> 03:23:17,652
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello?

2764
03:23:17,712 --> 03:23:18,012
Yes.

2765
03:23:19,053 --> 03:23:19,594
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight?

2766
03:23:19,754 --> 03:23:19,954
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2767
03:23:20,995 --> 03:23:21,596
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks?

2768
03:23:21,956 --> 03:23:22,296
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2769
03:23:23,317 --> 03:23:24,038
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell?

2770
03:23:24,318 --> 03:23:24,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2771
03:23:25,359 --> 03:23:26,179
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2772
03:23:26,380 --> 03:23:26,580
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2773
03:23:28,283 --> 03:23:30,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 70 affirmative, 0 in the negative, the motion passes.

2774
03:23:31,004 --> 03:23:48,228
[SPEAKER_06]: 2-0-549 offered by Council of the Night and Vice President Caraviello, whereas Razzo's Grill opened on Mystic Avenue, September 5th, 2005, and whereas since that time owner and proprietor Richard Razzo has been an invaluable contributor to the city of Medford through

2775
03:23:48,268 --> 03:23:50,590
[SPEAKER_06]: through countless donations and other acts of kindness.

2776
03:23:50,790 --> 03:24:09,028
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas September 5th, 2020 marks the 15th anniversary of Roswell's Grove grand opening, we have resolved that the Medford City Council thank Richard Roswell for his commitment to the community and congratulate Roswell's Grove for 15 years of success.

2777
03:24:10,495 --> 03:24:20,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Anniversary and be a further resolve that he be presented with a consultation memorial memorializing this momentous event console night

2778
03:24:24,486 --> 03:24:25,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor, Vice President Calvillo.

2779
03:24:25,887 --> 03:24:26,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2780
03:24:27,888 --> 03:24:37,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I've known Rich Ruseau for many years, and again, as Councilor and I stated, anytime something is needed in this community, he's one of the first guys to always step up.

2781
03:24:38,735 --> 03:24:42,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone passes away, Rich is the first guy there with food and things.

2782
03:24:43,578 --> 03:24:50,903
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, I've known him for many years, and again, he's one of those guys, you don't even have to ask.

2783
03:24:51,701 --> 03:24:54,885
[SPEAKER_02]: He's there, he's ready to donate, he's been a good member of the community.

2784
03:24:55,326 --> 03:25:01,835
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I wish him success on his 15 years in Obligo and another 15 years of that.

2785
03:25:01,855 --> 03:25:04,398
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Rich, for all the work you've done in this community.

2786
03:25:05,479 --> 03:25:06,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

2787
03:25:11,858 --> 03:25:13,039
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2788
03:25:13,119 --> 03:25:14,520
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Caraviello, thank you as well.

2789
03:25:14,760 --> 03:25:20,082
[SPEAKER_42]: And Richie, thank you for everything that you do to the City of Medford, for the City of Medford, in the City of Medford.

2790
03:25:20,983 --> 03:25:22,684
[SPEAKER_42]: Richard has been a great business owner.

2791
03:25:23,084 --> 03:25:26,025
[SPEAKER_42]: He's the type of business that we want to have here in the City of Medford.

2792
03:25:26,445 --> 03:25:28,446
[SPEAKER_42]: When the pandemic hit, you saw what he did.

2793
03:25:29,247 --> 03:25:32,268
[SPEAKER_42]: He put out jersey barriers, he put out a tent, he has live entertainment.

2794
03:25:32,728 --> 03:25:33,729
[SPEAKER_42]: He's trying to keep

2795
03:25:34,994 --> 03:25:36,375
[SPEAKER_42]: the sense of community going here.

2796
03:25:36,975 --> 03:25:48,423
[SPEAKER_42]: He does a great job, as Councilor Caraviello said, the countless, countless, countless deliveries of food to people's homes when their loved ones pass away, unsolicited, unwanted.

2797
03:25:49,904 --> 03:25:52,346
[SPEAKER_42]: In some instances, Mr. President, Richie goes above and beyond.

2798
03:25:52,946 --> 03:26:02,152
[SPEAKER_42]: And not just in terms of being a business owner, but in terms of being a community partner and someone that really loves the city of Medford, cares for the city of Medford, and wants to make it a better place.

2799
03:26:02,933 --> 03:26:03,834
[SPEAKER_42]: So with that being said,

2800
03:26:04,394 --> 03:26:09,755
[SPEAKER_42]: through you to Richie and to his staff, Peter and Jason and everybody else.

2801
03:26:09,775 --> 03:26:10,815
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you very much for all you do.

2802
03:26:11,796 --> 03:26:13,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2803
03:26:13,696 --> 03:26:14,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2804
03:26:15,056 --> 03:26:15,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2805
03:26:15,777 --> 03:26:18,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for my fellow council members.

2806
03:26:18,257 --> 03:26:20,718
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to send congratulations over to Richie.

2807
03:26:20,778 --> 03:26:29,980
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that, again, whenever there's a fundraiser and there's a young child going through some horrible issue and

2808
03:26:30,680 --> 03:26:32,241
[SPEAKER_11]: There's going to be a party.

2809
03:26:32,441 --> 03:26:36,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Richie's always the first one to call and donate and be there for the community.

2810
03:26:36,942 --> 03:26:40,083
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's why he's been around for 15 years.

2811
03:26:40,123 --> 03:26:48,006
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's why he'll be around for the next 15 years, because he's always there when people need him.

2812
03:26:51,616 --> 03:26:55,220
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not speaking from experience, but the product's not bad either, so.

2813
03:26:57,702 --> 03:27:00,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for bringing it forward, and congratulations, Rich.

2814
03:27:01,069 --> 03:27:02,430
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

2815
03:27:02,450 --> 03:27:03,190
[SPEAKER_38]: Councilor Marks.

2816
03:27:04,311 --> 03:27:10,113
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, and I want to thank my colleagues, Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Knight, for putting this on.

2817
03:27:10,534 --> 03:27:12,074
[SPEAKER_38]: You couldn't ask for a better person.

2818
03:27:12,695 --> 03:27:15,196
[SPEAKER_38]: I grew up with Rich Razzo in West Medford.

2819
03:27:15,676 --> 03:27:17,577
[SPEAKER_38]: We were very close friends for a lot of years.

2820
03:27:18,318 --> 03:27:26,101
[SPEAKER_38]: And he is a great business owner, a great family man, a great son, and just a good friend, Mr. President.

2821
03:27:26,782 --> 03:27:28,763
[SPEAKER_38]: And he runs his business the same way.

2822
03:27:30,083 --> 03:27:32,705
[SPEAKER_38]: It's like going to Cheers when you go into Razzles.

2823
03:27:33,565 --> 03:27:39,568
[SPEAKER_38]: You know everyone, he employs a lot of local kids from this community.

2824
03:27:40,489 --> 03:27:46,432
[SPEAKER_38]: He assists, as my council colleagues mentioned, on a number of activities that go on.

2825
03:27:46,752 --> 03:27:47,972
[SPEAKER_38]: He's the first to donate.

2826
03:27:48,353 --> 03:27:57,937
[SPEAKER_38]: If you ever look at donation list, Razzles is always on there giving of not only his food and his expertise, but his time as well, Mr. President.

2827
03:27:59,378 --> 03:28:05,805
[SPEAKER_38]: I wish him well, and as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, I wish him another 15 years, at the very least.

2828
03:28:06,626 --> 03:28:07,487
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2829
03:28:07,587 --> 03:28:08,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2830
03:28:08,648 --> 03:28:16,577
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I may conclude by thanking my council colleagues for bringing this forward tonight, and wishing Richie a happy anniversary.

2831
03:28:18,542 --> 03:28:24,646
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great place to eat and thank him for his continuous commitment to our community.

2832
03:28:25,467 --> 03:28:26,827
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, Rich Razo.

2833
03:28:27,528 --> 03:28:31,070
[SPEAKER_06]: On a motion of councilors, Knight and Caraviello.

2834
03:28:33,252 --> 03:28:34,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2835
03:28:34,973 --> 03:28:36,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

2836
03:28:40,556 --> 03:28:41,157
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears?

2837
03:28:41,577 --> 03:28:41,877
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

2838
03:28:42,638 --> 03:28:43,618
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello?

2839
03:28:43,898 --> 03:28:44,119
Yes.

2840
03:28:44,959 --> 03:28:45,479
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight?

2841
03:28:45,499 --> 03:28:45,560
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2842
03:28:45,680 --> 03:28:47,361
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks?

2843
03:28:47,401 --> 03:28:47,601
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2844
03:28:48,479 --> 03:28:49,119
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell?

2845
03:28:49,419 --> 03:28:49,680
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2846
03:28:50,420 --> 03:28:51,260
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2847
03:28:51,580 --> 03:28:51,821
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2848
03:28:52,581 --> 03:28:53,321
[SPEAKER_29]: President Falco?

2849
03:28:53,381 --> 03:28:53,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2850
03:28:53,661 --> 03:28:55,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

2851
03:28:55,082 --> 03:28:55,902
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

2852
03:28:56,643 --> 03:29:07,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Councilors Knight and Vice President Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Teresa Galoni on her recent passing.

2853
03:29:09,969 --> 03:29:10,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

2854
03:29:11,229 --> 03:29:15,131
[SPEAKER_41]: Again, I defer to the senior member, Mr. President.

2855
03:29:15,471 --> 03:29:16,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Caraviello.

2856
03:29:16,940 --> 03:29:18,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2857
03:29:19,361 --> 03:29:24,343
[SPEAKER_02]: The community lost another good person these past couple of weeks in Theresa Mone.

2858
03:29:24,844 --> 03:29:30,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Many know her because her husband, John, was a city manager of the city for many years, good man.

2859
03:29:30,786 --> 03:29:34,248
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, Theresa has a large family.

2860
03:29:35,268 --> 03:29:40,371
[SPEAKER_02]: All, let's say some of them worked in the city as teachers and other things.

2861
03:29:41,889 --> 03:29:47,114
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're just a good family, a long time of the family.

2862
03:29:47,514 --> 03:29:49,576
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, their presence in our community will be missed.

2863
03:29:50,677 --> 03:29:51,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

2864
03:29:51,958 --> 03:29:52,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

2865
03:29:53,245 --> 03:29:54,666
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2866
03:29:54,726 --> 03:30:03,529
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, as Councilor Caraviello mentioned, Teresa was the wife of former city manager John Glioni.

2867
03:30:04,109 --> 03:30:08,851
[SPEAKER_42]: And when John was here running the city, Teresa was running the show.

2868
03:30:09,731 --> 03:30:14,233
[SPEAKER_42]: As they always say, behind every good man is a better woman, and this is no different.

2869
03:30:14,793 --> 03:30:17,695
[SPEAKER_42]: What a great family the Glioni's raised.

2870
03:30:17,735 --> 03:30:21,356
[SPEAKER_42]: My dear friend, Janine McGonigal, Teresa was her mother.

2871
03:30:21,844 --> 03:30:23,425
[SPEAKER_42]: And she will be sadly missed.

2872
03:30:23,705 --> 03:30:29,368
[SPEAKER_42]: I'd just like to offer my condolences to the family and ask that my council colleagues join Councilor Caraviello and I in doing the same.

2873
03:30:30,329 --> 03:30:31,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you Councilor Knight.

2874
03:30:31,189 --> 03:30:31,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Bears.

2875
03:30:32,674 --> 03:30:36,595
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I send my condolences to the Goloni family as well.

2876
03:30:37,476 --> 03:30:55,562
[SPEAKER_34]: If my council colleagues would be open to it, I'd like to propose a B paper to also send our deep and sincere condolences to the family of Catherine Gorman Rodriguez, who is the mother of our city's chief of staff, Dave Rodriguez, sister of former school committee member Aaron DeBenedetto.

2877
03:30:55,582 --> 03:30:59,004
[SPEAKER_34]: And I would move that as a B paper.

2878
03:30:59,164 --> 03:30:59,444
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

2879
03:31:03,106 --> 03:31:04,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor.

2880
03:31:06,808 --> 03:31:07,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

2881
03:31:08,728 --> 03:31:09,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks.

2882
03:31:12,010 --> 03:31:13,090
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2883
03:31:13,170 --> 03:31:17,952
[SPEAKER_38]: And I want to thank Councilor Knight and Councilor Caraviello for putting this on tonight.

2884
03:31:19,213 --> 03:31:22,914
[SPEAKER_38]: Teresa was a true Methodite.

2885
03:31:24,895 --> 03:31:31,238
[SPEAKER_38]: As was mentioned, John was a staple and a household name, her husband for many years in this community.

2886
03:31:32,038 --> 03:31:35,560
[SPEAKER_38]: And she was always the foundation of that relationship.

2887
03:31:36,260 --> 03:31:42,583
[SPEAKER_38]: And I just want to thank her for her many years of committed service to this community.

2888
03:31:43,404 --> 03:31:49,667
[SPEAKER_38]: She was a terrific mother, wife, grandmother, and she will be sorely missed.

2889
03:31:50,287 --> 03:31:57,870
[SPEAKER_38]: And if my colleague wouldn't mind, I think it's only appropriate that we dedicate this meeting in Teresa Galoni's name.

2890
03:31:59,811 --> 03:32:00,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2891
03:32:03,476 --> 03:32:04,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpella.

2892
03:32:04,717 --> 03:32:05,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2893
03:32:05,737 --> 03:32:08,878
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that I appreciate my fellow councilors bringing this forward.

2894
03:32:08,918 --> 03:32:14,761
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that everybody said a lot of great things, and I'd like to just reiterate those statements.

2895
03:32:15,301 --> 03:32:22,804
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know it's sad, but you know when a family lays and leaves a legacy behind, and that's what Teresa's done.

2896
03:32:22,845 --> 03:32:23,285
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that

2897
03:32:24,545 --> 03:32:34,370
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way they raise their children and how they conduct themselves in here in our city of Medford and the legacy that they're passing on is so important to see.

2898
03:32:34,430 --> 03:32:44,535
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thank them for sharing their mother with us.

2899
03:32:44,555 --> 03:32:50,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Maloney was one of the best and I think that we send our condolences and prayers.

2900
03:32:50,238 --> 03:32:50,758
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

2901
03:32:51,937 --> 03:32:53,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. Scarpelli.

2902
03:32:53,919 --> 03:32:58,965
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also want to thank my colleagues for bringing this resolution forward.

2903
03:32:59,005 --> 03:33:07,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Mrs. Galoni was a great person, and our thoughts and prayers go to the Galoni family.

2904
03:33:08,396 --> 03:33:11,600
[SPEAKER_06]: So at this time, I'd ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

2905
03:33:40,083 --> 03:33:44,707
[SPEAKER_06]: And on that motion offered by Councilor Knight, actually, we'll take the B paper first.

2906
03:33:44,747 --> 03:33:46,728
[SPEAKER_06]: The B paper offered by Councilor Bears.

2907
03:33:48,390 --> 03:33:51,172
[SPEAKER_06]: And seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2908
03:33:51,192 --> 03:33:52,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk, please call the roll.

2909
03:33:54,855 --> 03:33:55,535
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears?

2910
03:33:56,236 --> 03:33:56,476
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

2911
03:33:56,496 --> 03:33:58,718
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello?

2912
03:33:58,758 --> 03:33:58,998
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2913
03:33:59,919 --> 03:34:00,459
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight?

2914
03:34:00,519 --> 03:34:00,719
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2915
03:34:01,920 --> 03:34:02,521
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks?

2916
03:34:02,601 --> 03:34:02,861
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2917
03:34:03,962 --> 03:34:04,662
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell?

2918
03:34:04,843 --> 03:34:05,103
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2919
03:34:06,003 --> 03:34:06,824
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2920
03:34:07,264 --> 03:34:07,485
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2921
03:34:08,345 --> 03:34:08,966
[SPEAKER_29]: President Falco?

2922
03:34:09,773 --> 03:34:11,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 7 affirmatives, 0 in the negative.

2923
03:34:11,374 --> 03:34:12,874
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

2924
03:34:13,035 --> 03:34:18,317
[SPEAKER_06]: On the main paper offered by Vice President Caraviello and Council Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2925
03:34:18,397 --> 03:34:19,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

2926
03:34:21,459 --> 03:34:22,159
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears?

2927
03:34:23,059 --> 03:34:23,339
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2928
03:34:24,100 --> 03:34:25,160
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello?

2929
03:34:25,180 --> 03:34:25,400
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2930
03:34:27,201 --> 03:34:27,761
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight?

2931
03:34:28,042 --> 03:34:28,242
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2932
03:34:29,442 --> 03:34:30,103
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks?

2933
03:34:30,223 --> 03:34:30,483
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2934
03:34:31,523 --> 03:34:32,244
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell?

2935
03:34:32,924 --> 03:34:33,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2936
03:34:34,445 --> 03:34:35,285
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2937
03:34:35,425 --> 03:34:35,645
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2938
03:34:36,486 --> 03:34:37,106
[SPEAKER_29]: President Falco?

2939
03:34:37,455 --> 03:34:41,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, seven affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

2940
03:34:41,659 --> 03:34:54,231
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-551, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council hold the Committee of the Whole to review the draft ordinance regulating donation collection bins as offered under paper 20-295 and drafted by the City Solicitor's Office.

2941
03:34:55,553 --> 03:34:56,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

2942
03:34:57,543 --> 03:35:02,965
[SPEAKER_40]: Relatively self-explanatory, Mr. President, in the September 8th packet, we did receive a draft ordinance that we requested.

2943
03:35:03,005 --> 03:35:09,427
[SPEAKER_42]: I believe it was at the direction of Councilor Caraviello, and based off a previous paper that was issued in the previous session, Mr. President.

2944
03:35:09,907 --> 03:35:13,389
[SPEAKER_42]: But with that being said, the solicitor's office has put out a work product for us to review.

2945
03:35:13,829 --> 03:35:17,550
[SPEAKER_42]: And I'd ask that a COW be scheduled so that we can have the opportunity to do such.

2946
03:35:17,570 --> 03:35:19,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Councilor Knight.

2947
03:35:19,471 --> 03:35:20,451
[SPEAKER_06]: It is on my list.

2948
03:35:20,651 --> 03:35:22,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be scheduling a meeting on that soon.

2949
03:35:25,094 --> 03:35:26,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello.

2950
03:35:26,415 --> 03:35:27,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2951
03:35:27,576 --> 03:35:33,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, this is something I proposed as Councilor Knight said last year, and I'm glad to see that it's finally come to fruition.

2952
03:35:34,281 --> 03:35:42,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I think many of us remember that fiasco at the Fellsway Plaza, where there was just stuff, trash piled up all over the place.

2953
03:35:43,707 --> 03:35:51,033
[SPEAKER_02]: And then other ones, and I did reach out to a couple of the owners of all of these companies.

2954
03:35:51,873 --> 03:36:01,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the language that they sent out to me, I forwarded on to the solicitor's office, but they were all amiable to having this ordinance.

2955
03:36:01,435 --> 03:36:09,157
[SPEAKER_02]: They said we were one of the few cities that had nothing, and there was no fees ever collected for putting these bins all over the city.

2956
03:36:09,517 --> 03:36:19,679
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm glad this has come forward, and I look forward to the council meeting to get this resolved and move on.

2957
03:36:20,059 --> 03:36:20,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2958
03:36:21,138 --> 03:36:22,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor, Vice President Caraviello.

2959
03:36:24,639 --> 03:36:27,280
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Council Knight, seconded by Vice President Caraviello.

2960
03:36:28,680 --> 03:36:29,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

2961
03:36:33,301 --> 03:36:33,922
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears?

2962
03:36:34,662 --> 03:36:34,982
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2963
03:36:35,762 --> 03:36:36,702
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello?

2964
03:36:36,922 --> 03:36:37,202
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2965
03:36:37,983 --> 03:36:38,463
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight?

2966
03:36:38,483 --> 03:36:38,543
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2967
03:36:40,403 --> 03:36:41,024
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks?

2968
03:36:41,424 --> 03:36:41,724
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2969
03:36:42,844 --> 03:36:43,504
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell?

2970
03:36:43,804 --> 03:36:44,084
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2971
03:36:44,805 --> 03:36:45,625
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2972
03:36:45,845 --> 03:36:46,025
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2973
03:36:47,701 --> 03:36:50,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 70 affirmatives, 0 in the negative, the motion passes.

2974
03:36:50,223 --> 03:36:52,824
[SPEAKER_34]: 2-0-- I move to withdraw, thank you.

2975
03:36:53,265 --> 03:36:56,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, 2-0-552 has been withdrawn.

2976
03:36:56,647 --> 03:37:09,397
[SPEAKER_06]: 2-0-553 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request a report from the school committee on its plans to address truancy during remote learning.

2977
03:37:10,538 --> 03:37:11,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

2978
03:37:12,159 --> 03:37:13,040
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, Mr. President.

2979
03:37:14,892 --> 03:37:22,559
[SPEAKER_42]: The Knight Early Education Academy over on Woburn Street has been up and running now for almost a week.

2980
03:37:23,179 --> 03:37:27,343
[SPEAKER_42]: And it's a trying experience, to say the least.

2981
03:37:28,224 --> 03:37:29,725
[SPEAKER_42]: But with that being said, Mr. President,

2982
03:37:31,400 --> 03:37:44,356
[SPEAKER_42]: One thing I'm noticing is that there's a need for us to be sure that those that don't have the same opportunities as others are still being provided the access to a quality public education.

2983
03:37:45,197 --> 03:37:47,140
[SPEAKER_42]: And truancy is one of those.

2984
03:37:47,860 --> 03:37:50,962
[SPEAKER_42]: one of those situations that's something that needs to be addressed.

2985
03:37:51,042 --> 03:37:55,504
[SPEAKER_42]: And our surrounding communities, some of them have multiple full-time truancy offices.

2986
03:37:55,724 --> 03:37:59,947
[SPEAKER_42]: I believe at one point the city of Somerville had three full-time truancy offices.

2987
03:38:00,867 --> 03:38:04,929
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm not saying or alluding to the fact that truancy is a problem in the city of Medford.

2988
03:38:05,529 --> 03:38:15,735
[SPEAKER_42]: But what I am saying is that based upon the new times that are before us and the expectations that have been expressed through our school committee and through that of DESE.

2989
03:38:16,896 --> 03:38:21,243
[SPEAKER_42]: the direction of the superintendent, ultimately our goal is to get kids back in school.

2990
03:38:21,643 --> 03:38:25,849
[SPEAKER_42]: But until then, we're going to be relying on remote learning or hybrid learning.

2991
03:38:26,530 --> 03:38:26,751
[SPEAKER_42]: And my

2992
03:38:28,703 --> 03:38:37,709
[SPEAKER_42]: concern is that certain subsects of our population are going to slip through the cracks and not be provided with the same opportunities that others are being provided during this time, Mr. President.

2993
03:38:38,490 --> 03:38:48,297
[SPEAKER_42]: So as the parent of a first grader and understanding that during these formidable years, the importance that education plays in the long-term development of

2994
03:38:48,917 --> 03:38:52,278
[SPEAKER_42]: an academic student raises concerns.

2995
03:38:52,338 --> 03:39:04,240
[SPEAKER_42]: So I'd ask that the school committee just provide us with a report as to what their plans are and how to address truancy during the pandemic and during the hybrid learning, during from home learning, Mr. President.

2996
03:39:04,300 --> 03:39:15,303
[SPEAKER_42]: I think it's very important that we understand what's going on so that we can ensure that all the students across the board are being provided with an ample opportunity to be educated properly.

2997
03:39:15,991 --> 03:39:26,782
[SPEAKER_42]: I'd like to further amend the paper to Mr. President and request a report from the school department indicating how many students we've lost to private schools between last year and this year due to the school closures.

2998
03:39:27,383 --> 03:39:29,765
[SPEAKER_42]: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support the paper.

2999
03:39:31,167 --> 03:39:31,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

3000
03:39:33,389 --> 03:39:34,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Bears?

3001
03:39:35,051 --> 03:39:35,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope?

3002
03:39:35,411 --> 03:39:35,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

3003
03:39:36,212 --> 03:39:36,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morell?

3004
03:39:37,605 --> 03:39:38,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3005
03:39:38,906 --> 03:39:41,027
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand the councilor's concerns around this.

3006
03:39:41,067 --> 03:39:57,738
[SPEAKER_12]: However, as the school committee doesn't report to the city council and there's not really much action we could take on this, I'm not sure I could support this, although I do support the amendment, so I'm conflicted there because as the amendment would later tie to budget ramifications, I understand that information is important to have.

3007
03:39:58,199 --> 03:40:05,644
[SPEAKER_12]: But regarding reports on truancy, I'm not sure what this body would actually do with something like that, especially considering the committee does not report to the council.

3008
03:40:07,220 --> 03:40:11,842
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, although the committee does not report to the council in terms of policy, the buck does stop here.

3009
03:40:12,963 --> 03:40:13,803
[SPEAKER_42]: The buck stops here.

3010
03:40:14,844 --> 03:40:21,727
[SPEAKER_42]: So if we're seeing a problem with truancy and we have one part-time truancy officer here in the community, maybe the council says it's time to kick it up a notch.

3011
03:40:21,827 --> 03:40:23,308
[SPEAKER_42]: Maybe you gotta hire a couple more people.

3012
03:40:24,288 --> 03:40:28,390
[SPEAKER_42]: And if you don't, then maybe we're going to have to hold back some funding over here until you do that.

3013
03:40:28,710 --> 03:40:32,712
[SPEAKER_42]: So there's an opportunity in a way for us, Mr. President, very similar to the way that we were able to

3014
03:40:33,072 --> 03:40:43,177
[SPEAKER_42]: broker a deal with the historical commission and the property owner to promote and push for certain aspects of a better quality public education.

3015
03:40:43,677 --> 03:40:51,341
[SPEAKER_42]: And where the council controls the purse strings, and truancy is a concern, and there's a school department policy and a city policy.

3016
03:40:51,761 --> 03:40:53,542
[SPEAKER_42]: I do believe that surrounds some of this stuff.

3017
03:40:53,582 --> 03:40:54,662
[SPEAKER_42]: I think it's important that we know.

3018
03:40:55,662 --> 03:40:56,643
[SPEAKER_42]: I guess my question is this.

3019
03:40:56,983 --> 03:40:59,904
[SPEAKER_42]: Why don't we want to know what their policy is on truancy?

3020
03:41:00,264 --> 03:41:02,305
[SPEAKER_42]: And why wouldn't we expect them to have one?

3021
03:41:02,965 --> 03:41:06,566
[SPEAKER_42]: It's not so much that we want to force something down their throat.

3022
03:41:06,687 --> 03:41:13,129
[SPEAKER_42]: All we're doing is asking them to report back to the council with a report on what its plans are to address truancy.

3023
03:41:14,069 --> 03:41:16,110
[SPEAKER_42]: It's not a request to tell them to make a plan.

3024
03:41:16,170 --> 03:41:18,891
[SPEAKER_42]: It's not a request to tell them how to do it, where to do it, or when to do it.

3025
03:41:19,151 --> 03:41:25,596
[SPEAKER_42]: It's a request to fill us in and give us information as to what you're doing to make sure that this situation doesn't happen.

3026
03:41:25,636 --> 03:41:27,577
[SPEAKER_42]: I can certainly appreciate the council's position.

3027
03:41:28,678 --> 03:41:35,583
[SPEAKER_42]: However, knowledge is power and the more knowledge we have, the better off we're going to be and the better job we're going to be able to do for the people and especially the students.

3028
03:41:36,543 --> 03:41:38,725
[SPEAKER_42]: As a parent, Mr. President, this is very concerning to me.

3029
03:41:40,046 --> 03:41:42,387
[SPEAKER_42]: Two young children at home, a six year old and a four year old.

3030
03:41:43,428 --> 03:41:47,011
[SPEAKER_42]: The day before school was supposed to start, my four year old lost his daycare.

3031
03:41:48,131 --> 03:41:51,996
[SPEAKER_42]: So people are struggling through this, and the more information that we have, the better.

3032
03:41:52,476 --> 03:42:03,147
[SPEAKER_42]: And the other thing that's important, Mr. President, is if we do see a truancy problem, usually the truancy problem isn't necessarily rooted in anything other than things going on at home.

3033
03:42:03,628 --> 03:42:08,673
[SPEAKER_42]: And while the school committee does have certain authority, the city has far more resources.

3034
03:42:09,474 --> 03:42:10,975
[SPEAKER_42]: when it comes down to family issues.

3035
03:42:12,116 --> 03:42:28,345
[SPEAKER_42]: So that's another opportunity, Mr. President, for us to gain some more information and then maybe modify or amend the types of services that we deliver to the residents here based upon the data that we're receiving to see what makes sense to be sure that the taxpayers are getting the level of services that they so deserve.

3036
03:42:29,406 --> 03:42:30,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

3037
03:42:32,027 --> 03:42:34,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morell, are you all set?

3038
03:42:34,909 --> 03:42:35,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

3039
03:42:35,249 --> 03:42:35,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Bears.

3040
03:42:36,730 --> 03:42:37,571
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3041
03:42:40,083 --> 03:42:47,010
[SPEAKER_34]: I do think that if the school committee passed a resolution asking us for a report on something, we might have an issue with that.

3042
03:42:47,811 --> 03:42:49,133
[SPEAKER_34]: So I just want to put that out there.

3043
03:42:49,393 --> 03:42:55,860
[SPEAKER_34]: But in terms of the framing on the actual issue, I definitely think that equity in access to attending remote learning is a concern.

3044
03:42:58,667 --> 03:43:02,228
[SPEAKER_34]: And it's just the framing, the framing of it.

3045
03:43:02,588 --> 03:43:04,589
[SPEAKER_34]: Address truancy, hire truancy often, sir.

3046
03:43:04,889 --> 03:43:10,191
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, I don't know if that really addresses the scope of how we address the problem of equity and access here.

3047
03:43:10,231 --> 03:43:12,872
[SPEAKER_34]: Because I think some of it, sure, some of it could be a family problem.

3048
03:43:12,892 --> 03:43:14,332
[SPEAKER_34]: Some of it could be technological.

3049
03:43:14,412 --> 03:43:17,053
[SPEAKER_34]: Some of it could be logistical.

3050
03:43:17,233 --> 03:43:21,114
[SPEAKER_34]: So I understand the concern, and I hear the concern.

3051
03:43:22,475 --> 03:43:23,735
[SPEAKER_34]: The framing just doesn't feel right to me.

3052
03:43:24,015 --> 03:43:24,815
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3053
03:43:25,456 --> 03:43:26,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

3054
03:43:28,723 --> 03:43:32,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on, let's see, just make sure you know where I'm at.

3055
03:43:32,944 --> 03:43:37,225
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of council, a night, as amended by council, a night, and seconded by?

3056
03:43:37,245 --> 03:43:38,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

3057
03:43:38,666 --> 03:43:39,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

3058
03:43:39,606 --> 03:43:40,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk, please call the roll.

3059
03:43:44,807 --> 03:43:45,528
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears?

3060
03:43:46,768 --> 03:43:47,268
[SPEAKER_32]: No.

3061
03:43:52,049 --> 03:43:52,970
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello?

3062
03:43:53,190 --> 03:43:53,450
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

3063
03:43:57,131 --> 03:43:57,711
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight?

3064
03:43:57,831 --> 03:43:57,991
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3065
03:44:01,462 --> 03:44:02,062
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks?

3066
03:44:02,122 --> 03:44:02,442
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3067
03:44:04,864 --> 03:44:05,464
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell?

3068
03:44:05,824 --> 03:44:06,064
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

3069
03:44:09,806 --> 03:44:10,586
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli?

3070
03:44:10,826 --> 03:44:11,047
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3071
03:44:14,308 --> 03:44:15,028
[SPEAKER_18]: President Falco?

3072
03:44:15,369 --> 03:44:15,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

3073
03:44:15,749 --> 03:44:17,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

3074
03:44:17,610 --> 03:44:18,470
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

3075
03:44:18,490 --> 03:44:30,236
[SPEAKER_06]: 2-0-554 offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the city administration report back to the council on the hiring of an election coordinator to oversee and coordinate elections in the city of Medford.

3076
03:44:31,172 --> 03:44:32,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

3077
03:44:34,414 --> 03:44:45,740
[SPEAKER_38]: Mr. President, this was an issue that the council spoke about several weeks back regarding the need for additional assistance within the registrar voters office.

3078
03:44:46,640 --> 03:44:48,922
[SPEAKER_38]: I have yet to see a response.

3079
03:44:49,982 --> 03:44:52,504
[SPEAKER_38]: that addresses the council concern, Mr. President.

3080
03:44:52,944 --> 03:45:12,298
[SPEAKER_38]: And this is not just the council concern, this is concern of many, many residents, if not thousands of residents, Mr. President, that just went through a primary election and some of the concerns that were associated with a new COVID type system.

3081
03:45:13,458 --> 03:45:18,543
[SPEAKER_38]: with mail-in ballots and so forth of the likes that we've never seen in this community before.

3082
03:45:19,143 --> 03:45:26,749
[SPEAKER_38]: The reason why I bring this up, Mr. President, is that we have an election, a very important election coming up in November.

3083
03:45:26,789 --> 03:45:29,291
[SPEAKER_38]: We have a presidential election coming up.

3084
03:45:29,952 --> 03:45:38,419
[SPEAKER_38]: And it's vital as a community that we have the resources to handle the election, Mr. President.

3085
03:45:39,299 --> 03:45:53,784
[SPEAKER_38]: Interesting fact that I just found out, since 2010, in this community, the number of voters went up by 55% compared to 2010.

3086
03:45:53,824 --> 03:46:05,567
[SPEAKER_38]: I've been telling people over the last several years, when they ask me how many voters we have in the community, I was rattling out a figure that I recall it was about 35,000 registered voters.

3087
03:46:08,658 --> 03:46:14,742
[SPEAKER_38]: Unbeknownst, Mr. President, we're up over 40,000 registered voters.

3088
03:46:15,583 --> 03:46:20,946
[SPEAKER_38]: So I was about 5,000 voters off from the last figure I had, Mr. President.

3089
03:46:21,787 --> 03:46:27,250
[SPEAKER_38]: This is only to show that the number of voters in this community has increased.

3090
03:46:27,730 --> 03:46:32,894
[SPEAKER_38]: The capacity in that office has not increased over the years, Mr. President.

3091
03:46:33,454 --> 03:46:40,978
[SPEAKER_38]: And it's about time that we hire someone to assist the city clerk who wears many hats in his role.

3092
03:46:42,178 --> 03:46:53,124
[SPEAKER_38]: And it's about time that we hire an election coordinator, someone that can go into the office, Mr. President, and run the registrar of voters office.

3093
03:46:53,764 --> 03:46:57,406
[SPEAKER_38]: Now election coordinator would not be just a figurehead.

3094
03:46:58,166 --> 03:47:08,813
[SPEAKER_38]: An election coordinator would address personnel needs, address issues of concern at all the polling locations, especially in a time of COVID.

3095
03:47:09,614 --> 03:47:12,736
[SPEAKER_38]: We're talking about increased safety for polling workers.

3096
03:47:13,076 --> 03:47:14,637
[SPEAKER_38]: We're talking about plexiglass.

3097
03:47:14,657 --> 03:47:15,778
[SPEAKER_38]: We're talking about masks.

3098
03:47:16,058 --> 03:47:19,460
[SPEAKER_38]: We're talking about sanitizing after someone goes into a polling booth.

3099
03:47:19,821 --> 03:47:27,666
[SPEAKER_38]: There's a lot more responsibility and things associated in this new COVID era that we're experiencing right now.

3100
03:47:29,167 --> 03:47:38,553
[SPEAKER_38]: The election coordinator would also be involved with the training of wardens, clerks, and inspectors for the elections.

3101
03:47:39,533 --> 03:47:46,538
[SPEAKER_38]: The election coordinator would be responsible for the maintaining and date working knowledge of

3102
03:47:46,938 --> 03:47:50,440
[SPEAKER_38]: election law as set forth by the Secretary of State's office.

3103
03:47:50,941 --> 03:47:56,004
[SPEAKER_38]: They would oversee the distribution of the absentee and no excuse mail-in ballots.

3104
03:47:56,604 --> 03:48:08,672
[SPEAKER_38]: They would follow and maintain all mandated deadlines, create all tally sheets for the clerk's folio, audit the folio at the close of the polls, ensure calculations are correct.

3105
03:48:09,432 --> 03:48:17,298
[SPEAKER_38]: Set up and maintain all tasks, including staff, instruction, training, poll pads, working with DPW for the setup of the polls.

3106
03:48:18,139 --> 03:48:25,164
[SPEAKER_38]: Process on a daily basis all ballots cast during early voting through the VRIS state system.

3107
03:48:26,505 --> 03:48:28,967
[SPEAKER_38]: Organize early tabulation and central tabulation.

3108
03:48:29,468 --> 03:48:34,231
[SPEAKER_38]: Create spreadsheets and certification tabulation of elections.

3109
03:48:35,904 --> 03:48:41,208
[SPEAKER_38]: You could see the importance, Mr. President, of having someone that would oversee this process.

3110
03:48:42,148 --> 03:48:53,676
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think asking the city clerk, who already has a full plate, just from being city clerk and dealing with the council, to then also say, you're also in charge every year.

3111
03:48:54,237 --> 03:48:56,719
[SPEAKER_38]: This is not every couple of years, every other year.

3112
03:48:57,139 --> 03:49:03,864
[SPEAKER_38]: Every year to run a major election in a city of our size, Mr. President, I think is asking for too much.

3113
03:49:04,364 --> 03:49:13,986
[SPEAKER_38]: Most surrounding communities have an election coordinator, they have someone that's in charge of the election process, and it is not the city clerk.

3114
03:49:14,406 --> 03:49:15,747
[SPEAKER_38]: It is an additional role.

3115
03:49:16,407 --> 03:49:31,110
[SPEAKER_38]: And I would ask Mr. President, in the interest of maintaining what I would say is fair elections in this community, maintaining a system that I think we all feel comfortable knowing that our system is a good system in the city of Method.

3116
03:49:31,690 --> 03:49:32,690
[SPEAKER_38]: Does it need improvements?

3117
03:49:32,910 --> 03:49:33,491
[SPEAKER_38]: Absolutely.

3118
03:49:33,771 --> 03:49:36,792
[SPEAKER_38]: Does it require additional staff like a coordinator?

3119
03:49:37,492 --> 03:49:38,012
[SPEAKER_38]: Definitely.

3120
03:49:39,052 --> 03:49:43,794
[SPEAKER_38]: And we want to maintain the integrity of what we have, Mr. President, in our community.

3121
03:49:44,514 --> 03:50:00,159
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think that will go a long way to ensuring residents that in this new day and age, with probably the expansion of moving forward with voting, early voting, and voting by mail and so forth, it's only going to expand.

3122
03:50:01,059 --> 03:50:06,381
[SPEAKER_38]: that we really need to make sure we have a state-of-the-art register of voters office.

3123
03:50:06,782 --> 03:50:08,402
[SPEAKER_38]: We have great workers in there.

3124
03:50:08,983 --> 03:50:12,244
[SPEAKER_38]: We have great women that have been in there for a number of years.

3125
03:50:12,584 --> 03:50:13,985
[SPEAKER_38]: They do terrific work.

3126
03:50:14,965 --> 03:50:24,790
[SPEAKER_38]: But I think it's time, Mr. President, that we connect everything together now and really go into the 21st century and provide the tools that we need for that office.

3127
03:50:25,190 --> 03:50:30,252
[SPEAKER_38]: So again, I ask that the administration, Mr. President, because this was sent to the mayor,

3128
03:50:31,069 --> 03:50:35,652
[SPEAKER_38]: The administration reflect upon this and the integrity of our elections.

3129
03:50:36,353 --> 03:50:44,919
[SPEAKER_38]: And we have previous experience from the primary of what can potentially go wrong in an election.

3130
03:50:45,620 --> 03:50:47,501
[SPEAKER_38]: And the fact that we need this assistance.

3131
03:50:47,961 --> 03:50:50,403
[SPEAKER_38]: This is not City Councilor Michael Mark saying it.

3132
03:50:50,743 --> 03:50:52,605
[SPEAKER_38]: This is residents throughout the community.

3133
03:50:52,985 --> 03:50:54,606
[SPEAKER_38]: This is the city clerk himself.

3134
03:50:55,407 --> 03:50:59,430
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think it's about time that we get a commitment from this administration.

3135
03:51:01,263 --> 03:51:03,967
[SPEAKER_38]: Mr. President, to put this position in the budget.

3136
03:51:04,287 --> 03:51:14,222
[SPEAKER_38]: Whatever it takes to fund it, let's do it, let's move forward, and let's make sure we maintain the integrity of our electoral process in the city of Meffitt.

3137
03:51:14,382 --> 03:51:14,743
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

3138
03:51:14,843 --> 03:51:15,844
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

3139
03:51:16,585 --> 03:51:17,547
[SPEAKER_38]: Vice President Caraviello.

3140
03:51:17,878 --> 03:51:18,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3141
03:51:18,659 --> 03:51:23,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, this is something that was supported by this whole council a couple of weeks ago.

3142
03:51:23,622 --> 03:51:30,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in about 40 days, we got one of the most important elections in our time coming up.

3143
03:51:30,906 --> 03:51:34,189
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not the time to have the clerk.

3144
03:51:35,549 --> 03:51:38,850
[SPEAKER_02]: be backpedaling on things that he needs to help.

3145
03:51:39,191 --> 03:51:41,872
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen that in the past election.

3146
03:51:42,592 --> 03:51:45,633
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to see it coming going forward in all future elections.

3147
03:51:45,993 --> 03:51:48,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is not a one man job anymore.

3148
03:51:48,474 --> 03:51:52,235
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a position that needs to be filled.

3149
03:51:53,036 --> 03:51:56,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's not a one day vote anymore.

3150
03:51:56,477 --> 03:51:58,718
[SPEAKER_02]: We now vote on five or six, seven days.

3151
03:52:00,279 --> 03:52:06,535
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we try to do this with volunteers and smoke and mirrors.

3152
03:52:06,555 --> 03:52:07,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, those days are over.

3153
03:52:09,250 --> 03:52:19,573
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about time the city steps up, as Councilor Monk said, and hires a full-time person to do this, and to bring our elections up to where they need to be.

3154
03:52:19,994 --> 03:52:26,636
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I support Councilor Monk's on this, and I think all my other councilors, I think we're all feeling the same way.

3155
03:52:27,696 --> 03:52:28,356
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to do it.

3156
03:52:28,956 --> 03:52:29,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why we're waiting.

3157
03:52:30,217 --> 03:52:33,518
[SPEAKER_02]: They say we got 40 days, and in 40 days, you're going to have an election coming up.

3158
03:52:34,238 --> 03:52:36,579
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're still back at square one.

3159
03:52:38,677 --> 03:52:38,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

3160
03:52:39,298 --> 03:52:41,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Bears.

3161
03:52:41,721 --> 03:52:42,502
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3162
03:52:42,522 --> 03:52:43,564
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't want to beat a dead horse.

3163
03:52:43,604 --> 03:52:47,950
[SPEAKER_34]: I think Councilor Marks and Councilor Caraviello made a lot of good points.

3164
03:52:48,631 --> 03:52:54,640
[SPEAKER_34]: If it was not 11 p.m., I might be a little more angry because I think we literally saw the city clerk

3165
03:52:56,174 --> 03:53:02,837
[SPEAKER_34]: physically change and feel the stress of working hundreds of hours in a very short amount of time to make an election work that we've never seen before.

3166
03:53:04,418 --> 03:53:06,999
[SPEAKER_34]: And to be honest, the city clerk has been asking for this for years.

3167
03:53:07,579 --> 03:53:13,221
[SPEAKER_34]: For years he's been asking for this to be in the budget from the mayor's office, and this man, the previous mayor, it just hasn't gotten in.

3168
03:53:13,362 --> 03:53:14,102
[SPEAKER_34]: They haven't put it in.

3169
03:53:14,342 --> 03:53:17,303
[SPEAKER_34]: So it's not like we didn't see this coming down the road.

3170
03:53:17,924 --> 03:53:20,805
[SPEAKER_34]: Early voting, 10 days of early voting, is enshrined in law.

3171
03:53:21,545 --> 03:53:26,766
[SPEAKER_34]: from now until forever for primary and the general election, so that's there.

3172
03:53:27,426 --> 03:53:32,107
[SPEAKER_34]: Now we're gonna have mail ballots, maybe for a long time, maybe that'll be enshrined into law too.

3173
03:53:32,907 --> 03:53:37,688
[SPEAKER_34]: There's a ballot question, we might have ranked choice voting, which might also add to the elections plate.

3174
03:53:38,288 --> 03:53:46,670
[SPEAKER_34]: And just to make the point, this city clerk has put on four, by November, he will have put on four major elections in 12 months.

3175
03:53:46,990 --> 03:53:50,631
[SPEAKER_34]: The municipal election, the presidential primary, the state and federal primary,

3176
03:53:51,151 --> 03:53:52,011
[SPEAKER_34]: and the general election.

3177
03:53:52,031 --> 03:53:54,472
[SPEAKER_34]: Four elections in 12 months without an elections coordinator.

3178
03:53:54,512 --> 03:53:58,493
[SPEAKER_34]: So I'm a little angry that this hasn't been addressed.

3179
03:53:58,794 --> 03:54:05,476
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm a little angry that the clerk was kind of hung out to dry when he's been asking for this to be addressed for years and it hasn't been done.

3180
03:54:05,636 --> 03:54:07,936
[SPEAKER_34]: So let's do it.

3181
03:54:09,497 --> 03:54:10,477
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't know what else to say.

3182
03:54:10,497 --> 03:54:11,898
[SPEAKER_34]: It needs to be done.

3183
03:54:12,178 --> 03:54:12,498
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

3184
03:54:13,882 --> 03:54:14,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

3185
03:54:14,822 --> 03:54:15,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight?

3186
03:54:16,123 --> 03:54:21,166
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, I do remember, maybe, was it five weeks ago?

3187
03:54:21,846 --> 03:54:33,672
[SPEAKER_42]: You sent an email out to the administration talking about $250,000 that was part of our agreement with cable, our cable agreement.

3188
03:54:34,233 --> 03:54:34,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

3189
03:54:35,223 --> 03:54:40,766
[SPEAKER_42]: And I don't believe we ever got a response as to whether or not those funds were going to be appropriated or how they were going to be utilized, did we?

3190
03:54:44,502 --> 03:54:45,322
[SPEAKER_42]: It was a form letter.

3191
03:54:46,663 --> 03:54:48,124
[SPEAKER_42]: Similar to a form letter, if I'm not mistaken.

3192
03:54:48,144 --> 03:54:49,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there was a response.

3193
03:54:49,364 --> 03:54:53,667
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't say how the funds were going to be spent, but they were not included in the budget.

3194
03:54:53,987 --> 03:55:07,614
[SPEAKER_42]: May I be so bold to suggest, Mr. President, that a portion of the $250,000 from the cable agreement be allotted for the purpose of hiring an election coordinator for the November general election?

3195
03:55:09,294 --> 03:55:12,736
[SPEAKER_42]: And can I be so bold as to suggest that in the form of a amendment?

3196
03:55:13,036 --> 03:55:13,437
[SPEAKER_42]: Second.

3197
03:55:13,817 --> 03:55:14,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

3198
03:55:16,178 --> 03:55:17,038
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't want to steal your thunder.

3199
03:55:17,058 --> 03:55:19,019
[SPEAKER_42]: You're the guy that found the money, John, but let's spend it.

3200
03:55:19,539 --> 03:55:21,220
[SPEAKER_06]: No, actually, I was thinking the same thing.

3201
03:55:21,240 --> 03:55:24,521
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on the same page, if I may.

3202
03:55:24,541 --> 03:55:26,842
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on the same page.

3203
03:55:27,343 --> 03:55:31,844
[SPEAKER_06]: The money's there, and it should be spent.

3204
03:55:32,185 --> 03:55:44,730
[SPEAKER_06]: The administration should be meeting with the clerk to find out exactly what needs he has with regard to the upcoming election, and then long term, what they need to make sure that their office is stacked properly.

3205
03:55:45,675 --> 03:55:49,597
[SPEAKER_06]: And all my colleagues have had great points.

3206
03:55:51,358 --> 03:55:56,320
[SPEAKER_06]: We all agree on this, I think 100%, and that is that the clerk needs help.

3207
03:55:57,281 --> 03:56:04,104
[SPEAKER_06]: And the demand to the job, I mean, it's always been a demanding job, but it's really demanding now with all the mail-in voting.

3208
03:56:04,984 --> 03:56:08,326
[SPEAKER_06]: And early voting, I mean, the role has changed throughout the years.

3209
03:56:09,106 --> 03:56:11,947
[SPEAKER_06]: There is money there, and that money should be used.

3210
03:56:11,967 --> 03:56:19,730
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, that's a perfect place to actually spend the money, because this is going to have an impact.

3211
03:56:19,770 --> 03:56:25,733
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need to make sure that that office is stacked properly for the upcoming election and long term.

3212
03:56:26,313 --> 03:56:26,914
[SPEAKER_06]: for the future.

3213
03:56:27,254 --> 03:56:29,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to thank the clerk for all his hard work.

3214
03:56:29,817 --> 03:56:38,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I talk to him I think probably on a daily basis and I know he puts in a lot of time and a lot of hours and I know everyone in his office does as well.

3215
03:56:38,645 --> 03:56:40,466
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thank them for all their hard work.

3216
03:56:40,706 --> 03:56:42,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight, I thank you for bringing that forward.

3217
03:56:42,968 --> 03:56:44,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears, I believe you had your hand up.

3218
03:56:44,730 --> 03:56:50,434
[SPEAKER_34]: just as if I may, and not to step on your toes, I know for a fact that the clerk has made these asks directly.

3219
03:56:51,274 --> 03:56:52,935
[SPEAKER_34]: It's not about meeting and asking what they need.

3220
03:56:52,975 --> 03:56:56,718
[SPEAKER_34]: The needs have been outlined, the asks have been made, and they are not being answered.

3221
03:56:56,898 --> 03:56:59,900
[SPEAKER_34]: So it's just very frustrating.

3222
03:57:01,061 --> 03:57:03,202
[SPEAKER_06]: It needs to be a priority, without a doubt.

3223
03:57:03,342 --> 03:57:07,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope the administration looks at it as a priority as well.

3224
03:57:08,085 --> 03:57:09,026
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see.

3225
03:57:09,646 --> 03:57:12,388
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion, make sure there's no one with their hand up.

3226
03:57:16,834 --> 03:57:19,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Marks.

3227
03:57:21,217 --> 03:57:22,558
[SPEAKER_06]: As amended by Councilor Knight.

3228
03:57:24,539 --> 03:57:26,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor, Vice President Caraviello.

3229
03:57:27,101 --> 03:57:28,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

3230
03:57:34,586 --> 03:57:35,266
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears.

3231
03:57:36,107 --> 03:57:36,447
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3232
03:57:37,228 --> 03:57:38,188
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello.

3233
03:57:38,228 --> 03:57:38,468
Yes.

3234
03:57:39,509 --> 03:57:40,030
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight.

3235
03:57:40,190 --> 03:57:40,450
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3236
03:57:41,310 --> 03:57:41,951
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks.

3237
03:57:42,251 --> 03:57:42,491
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

3238
03:57:43,832 --> 03:57:44,473
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell.

3239
03:57:44,813 --> 03:57:45,013
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3240
03:57:45,902 --> 03:57:46,662
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli?

3241
03:57:46,942 --> 03:57:47,162
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3242
03:57:48,322 --> 03:57:49,043
[SPEAKER_29]: President Falco?

3243
03:57:49,143 --> 03:57:49,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

3244
03:57:49,423 --> 03:57:50,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven the affirmative, zero the negative.

3245
03:57:50,763 --> 03:57:51,743
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

3246
03:57:51,763 --> 03:58:01,865
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-555 offered by Councilor Marks being resolved at the most recent visit to Medford by Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pawlik be discussed.

3247
03:58:02,245 --> 03:58:02,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks?

3248
03:58:06,926 --> 03:58:08,086
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3249
03:58:08,466 --> 03:58:13,367
[SPEAKER_38]: And even though it's late at night, I have the energy to be angry about this.

3250
03:58:14,387 --> 03:58:14,927
[SPEAKER_38]: Let me tell you.

3251
03:58:17,675 --> 03:58:33,361
[SPEAKER_38]: It was great on September 10th, Mr. President, when I put on the local news and I saw the governor, the lieutenant governor, Secretary of Transportation Pollack, all in Bistro 5 in West Method.

3252
03:58:34,682 --> 03:58:39,324
[SPEAKER_38]: The governor was there to talk about his daily or weekly COVID report.

3253
03:58:40,441 --> 03:58:48,410
[SPEAKER_38]: And then they also found time, Mr. President, to discuss the outdoor dining, which I support 1,000%.

3254
03:58:49,771 --> 03:58:54,517
[SPEAKER_38]: And also as part of this, Mr. President, Secretary Pollack

3255
03:58:55,416 --> 03:59:00,260
[SPEAKER_38]: mentioned about several projects that are going on in the community.

3256
03:59:01,180 --> 03:59:04,403
[SPEAKER_38]: One being complete streets, how we've received money.

3257
03:59:05,243 --> 03:59:09,647
[SPEAKER_38]: And I am thankful for the money, I'm thankful for the projects that have taken place.

3258
03:59:10,347 --> 03:59:17,993
[SPEAKER_38]: The other is the recent money we received from MassDOT regarding the shared streets and spaces grants.

3259
03:59:18,593 --> 03:59:44,670
[SPEAKER_38]: And that is partly the reason why they were there to show how we're able now to do some outdoor dining and take some of the money to do heating ramps and cement barriers and anything else that would assist local entrepreneurs in the community to have additional seating during this COVID, which I support a thousand percent, Mr. President.

3260
03:59:45,451 --> 03:59:47,833
[SPEAKER_38]: The one issue I do have, Mr. President,

3261
03:59:48,752 --> 03:59:51,794
[SPEAKER_38]: The one issue I think everyone behind this real should have.

3262
03:59:52,494 --> 04:00:01,460
[SPEAKER_38]: And if we had a real media in this community, there was a lot of media there, Mr. President, but they weren't locals.

3263
04:00:02,740 --> 04:00:04,482
[SPEAKER_38]: The questions asked weren't locals.

3264
04:00:05,722 --> 04:00:11,166
[SPEAKER_38]: If they invited the rest of us, and if the rest of us were able to get into that,

3265
04:00:12,051 --> 04:00:26,261
[SPEAKER_38]: meeting as my colleague experienced for himself that attended and wasn't one of the lucky people to be able to attend the meeting and maybe ask a question or partake in the conference that was happening.

3266
04:00:27,469 --> 04:00:40,478
[SPEAKER_38]: But Mr. President, what has this council and the residents of this community have talked about and requested from MassDOT, Secretary of Transportation Pollack, for the last 20 years?

3267
04:00:40,518 --> 04:00:46,202
[SPEAKER_38]: Although she hasn't been the secretary for that long, but she's been there for several years under this current administration.

3268
04:00:48,264 --> 04:00:53,508
[SPEAKER_38]: One of the top three most dangerous intersections in this community.

3269
04:00:57,233 --> 04:00:59,374
[SPEAKER_38]: The corner of South Street and Main Street.

3270
04:01:00,775 --> 04:01:03,997
[SPEAKER_38]: It's been a bone of contention since I've been on this council.

3271
04:01:06,438 --> 04:01:18,585
[SPEAKER_38]: And here we have the Secretary of Transportation coming in and touting complete streets and mass DOT shared streets, which are great programs, Mr. President.

3272
04:01:19,687 --> 04:01:26,951
[SPEAKER_38]: But no mention of a major issue, we've sent countless resolutions from this council to DOT.

3273
04:01:27,871 --> 04:01:30,873
[SPEAKER_38]: We've sent it to the mayor, we've sent it to our state delegation.

3274
04:01:31,153 --> 04:01:38,777
[SPEAKER_38]: Councilor Scapelli has had countless meetings on this, requesting that signalization be placed at that intersection.

3275
04:01:39,538 --> 04:01:45,641
[SPEAKER_38]: That some low lying fruit be done, signage, painting of crosswalks.

3276
04:01:47,975 --> 04:01:53,136
[SPEAKER_38]: winding of curbs and sidewalks, traffic calming initiatives.

3277
04:01:55,677 --> 04:02:08,559
[SPEAKER_38]: And to have the audacity, Mr. President, or maybe this doesn't make it to the secretary's desk when we request things as a city council on behalf of 60,000 people, Mr. President.

3278
04:02:09,399 --> 04:02:17,141
[SPEAKER_38]: But I would think an issue of that importance should have been part of the discussion, whether it was during the press conference,

3279
04:02:18,038 --> 04:02:22,502
[SPEAKER_38]: before the press conference, on the sidewalk, after the press conference.

3280
04:02:23,062 --> 04:02:38,475
[SPEAKER_38]: But at some point, Mr. President, I would hope that this discussion around a two-decade-old public safety concern in this community needed to be addressed.

3281
04:02:39,906 --> 04:02:42,368
[SPEAKER_38]: And I can guarantee you it wasn't mentioned.

3282
04:02:43,028 --> 04:02:44,649
[SPEAKER_38]: It didn't make the list, Mr. President.

3283
04:02:44,989 --> 04:02:48,772
[SPEAKER_38]: They were just here to tell what they want to tell.

3284
04:02:50,293 --> 04:02:54,515
[SPEAKER_38]: And not address the issues that we're talking about as a community.

3285
04:02:57,277 --> 04:03:00,719
[SPEAKER_38]: And South Street's just one, but it's a major one, Mr. President.

3286
04:03:03,461 --> 04:03:04,822
[SPEAKER_38]: So as far as I'm concerned,

3287
04:03:06,095 --> 04:03:24,181
[SPEAKER_38]: Next time we invite Secretary of Transportation Paul to the city of Method, she should come bearing several million dollars to do the signalization we need from Salem Street to Potter High Street to Main Street.

3288
04:03:25,168 --> 04:03:26,569
[SPEAKER_38]: To finish off that corridor.

3289
04:03:26,909 --> 04:03:31,733
[SPEAKER_38]: That is not, that part of South and Main is not city property.

3290
04:03:31,993 --> 04:03:36,416
[SPEAKER_38]: If it was, I'd be barking at the administration, I'd be barking at our traffic commission.

3291
04:03:37,817 --> 04:03:40,880
[SPEAKER_38]: We're building a brand new police station across the street.

3292
04:03:42,441 --> 04:03:44,442
[SPEAKER_38]: And you have to risk your life to get there.

3293
04:03:47,004 --> 04:03:48,986
[SPEAKER_38]: It really is a disgrace, Mr. President.

3294
04:03:51,035 --> 04:04:07,328
[SPEAKER_38]: And it bothered me to see Secretary Pollack sit back and take kudos for some other projects that are warranted, and I support Mr. President, but to not address the 1,000 pound gorilla in the room.

3295
04:04:09,430 --> 04:04:15,054
[SPEAKER_38]: And if she wasn't advised of the letters we've been sending over the past 20 years, shame on her staff.

3296
04:04:16,936 --> 04:04:18,457
[SPEAKER_38]: And shame on who's in charge there.

3297
04:04:20,987 --> 04:04:32,116
[SPEAKER_38]: I'd like to send a letter, Mr. President, from this council, and I hope the council will support it, to Secretary Pollack, thanking her for coming to the city of Method on September 10th.

3298
04:04:33,718 --> 04:04:40,944
[SPEAKER_38]: And thanking her for her work on complete streets and the shared streets and spaces grant program.

3299
04:04:42,064 --> 04:04:49,811
[SPEAKER_38]: However, Mr. President, I want to know what's happening at the corner of South and Main Street.

3300
04:04:51,650 --> 04:05:00,495
[SPEAKER_38]: And I want to know why we haven't received a thorough response from the Department of Transportation that addresses the public safety concerns of this community.

3301
04:05:01,536 --> 04:05:03,016
[SPEAKER_38]: You know how many accidents have been there.

3302
04:05:03,237 --> 04:05:05,758
[SPEAKER_38]: I brought this up about six, seven, eight weeks ago.

3303
04:05:06,078 --> 04:05:08,439
[SPEAKER_38]: I got the statistics from the chief of police.

3304
04:05:08,700 --> 04:05:13,963
[SPEAKER_38]: And when I say in the top three accident related and most dangerous intersections, I didn't create that.

3305
04:05:14,223 --> 04:05:17,124
[SPEAKER_38]: That was from his data that he presented to me.

3306
04:05:18,045 --> 04:05:19,566
[SPEAKER_38]: That was directly from his data.

3307
04:05:20,998 --> 04:05:23,599
[SPEAKER_38]: So this is not a pie in the sky or a wish list.

3308
04:05:24,359 --> 04:05:27,340
[SPEAKER_38]: This is a public safety concern, and we've all addressed it.

3309
04:05:28,481 --> 04:05:30,462
[SPEAKER_38]: We've all addressed it a million times, Mr. President.

3310
04:05:30,742 --> 04:05:38,405
[SPEAKER_38]: So I respectfully request that the city clerk draft a letter on behalf of the Medford City Council.

3311
04:05:39,437 --> 04:05:57,188
[SPEAKER_38]: requesting that Secretary Pollack address, once again, the request of this council about what are they going to do regarding the intersection, the state road, the intersection of South and Main Street, in the interest of public safety.

3312
04:05:58,108 --> 04:05:59,029
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3313
04:05:59,249 --> 04:06:00,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

3314
04:06:01,290 --> 04:06:04,212
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight.

3315
04:06:05,172 --> 04:06:06,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Renovies, please call the roll.

3316
04:06:11,626 --> 04:06:18,892
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm still copying down some of the language in the letter that Councilor Marks wants me to draft, which I'm happy to do.

3317
04:06:19,132 --> 04:06:20,633
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'll get that from the tape in the morning.

3318
04:06:21,774 --> 04:06:28,099
[SPEAKER_29]: But on the motion, Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight, here comes the roll call.

3319
04:06:28,339 --> 04:06:28,980
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears?

3320
04:06:34,965 --> 04:06:35,565
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears?

3321
04:06:38,167 --> 04:06:39,748
[SPEAKER_29]: Should I skip and come back?

3322
04:06:42,247 --> 04:06:42,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Bears.

3323
04:06:44,309 --> 04:06:44,689
[SPEAKER_34]: What's the motion?

3324
04:06:44,709 --> 04:06:45,630
[SPEAKER_34]: The letter to the secretary?

3325
04:06:46,511 --> 04:06:47,431
[SPEAKER_08]: The letter to the secretary.

3326
04:06:47,451 --> 04:06:48,232
[SPEAKER_37]: Secretary Paul.

3327
04:06:48,392 --> 04:06:48,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

3328
04:06:48,692 --> 04:06:52,536
[SPEAKER_37]: Ask her why she doesn't address Salton Bay yet.

3329
04:06:53,356 --> 04:06:54,778
[SPEAKER_34]: We're already voting yes.

3330
04:06:54,798 --> 04:06:56,119
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

3331
04:06:56,859 --> 04:06:57,760
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello.

3332
04:06:57,960 --> 04:06:58,241
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

3333
04:06:59,482 --> 04:07:00,062
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight.

3334
04:07:00,322 --> 04:07:00,583
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3335
04:07:01,563 --> 04:07:02,244
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks.

3336
04:07:02,484 --> 04:07:02,764
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

3337
04:07:03,625 --> 04:07:04,286
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell.

3338
04:07:04,506 --> 04:07:04,786
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3339
04:07:05,507 --> 04:07:06,367
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli.

3340
04:07:06,508 --> 04:07:06,628
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3341
04:07:07,540 --> 04:07:08,201
[SPEAKER_29]: President Falco.

3342
04:07:08,441 --> 04:07:11,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 7 the affirmative, 0 the negative, the motion passes.

3343
04:07:11,063 --> 04:07:15,306
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-556 offered by Council of Marks be resolved at the Medford City Council.

3344
04:07:15,847 --> 04:07:28,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Meet with Chief Buckley, our State Delegation, Building Commissioner Moki, and City Solicitor Kim Scanlon to review local policies and procedures regarding halfway homes within the City of Medford.

3345
04:07:28,717 --> 04:07:29,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Council of Marks.

3346
04:07:31,243 --> 04:07:32,084
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3347
04:07:32,104 --> 04:07:42,737
[SPEAKER_38]: I was approached by a number of residents in the city of Method that had concern regarding state regulated and licensed halfway homes within our community.

3348
04:07:42,757 --> 04:07:49,726
[SPEAKER_38]: I did a little additional research and some past history I have working

3349
04:07:50,667 --> 04:07:56,092
[SPEAKER_38]: with residents regarding a previous halfway house that existed in the Wellington area.

3350
04:07:56,973 --> 04:08:07,162
[SPEAKER_38]: I found some information that I think people would be surprised about when the state regulates and licenses halfway homes within the state.

3351
04:08:08,023 --> 04:08:12,608
[SPEAKER_38]: There is zero notification to cities and towns, Mr. President.

3352
04:08:14,206 --> 04:08:21,392
[SPEAKER_38]: There are zero regulations on our books regarding halfway homes within our community.

3353
04:08:22,072 --> 04:08:27,717
[SPEAKER_38]: There are zero zoning ordinances regarding halfway houses in our community.

3354
04:08:28,277 --> 04:08:39,746
[SPEAKER_38]: And I put this forward, Mr. President, as chapter 111B of the Mass General Law section 6A that the Board of Health regulates halfway homes within the state.

3355
04:08:40,667 --> 04:09:03,452
[SPEAKER_38]: And I put it on that we have a round table discussion with Chief Buckley, with our state delegation, our building commissioner, our city solicitor, to make sure, Mr. President, that we have rules and regulations within our community, Mr. President, that safeguard our residents.

3356
04:09:04,671 --> 04:09:08,912
[SPEAKER_38]: And there was an unfortunate incident that took place a few weeks back.

3357
04:09:09,392 --> 04:09:12,753
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank God a resident came out of it.

3358
04:09:14,493 --> 04:09:19,314
[SPEAKER_38]: All right, Mr. President, but it could have went very different, very, very different.

3359
04:09:20,434 --> 04:09:33,597
[SPEAKER_38]: And there was some concern regarding this particular incident and that this particular issue of halfway homes within our community needs to be reviewed.

3360
04:09:35,213 --> 04:09:39,375
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm not saying we have to eliminate, which I don't believe we can, Mr. President.

3361
04:09:39,995 --> 04:09:43,637
[SPEAKER_38]: But I believe, as Councilman Knight mentioned, knowledge is power.

3362
04:09:44,737 --> 04:09:51,901
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think that we should have the knowledge when a halfway home is licensed in our community.

3363
04:09:53,271 --> 04:10:09,010
[SPEAKER_38]: And that at the very least, we should be on notice, Mr. President, on how we should protect residents that may be living within proximity of these particular homes, Mr. President.

3364
04:10:09,731 --> 04:10:11,093
[SPEAKER_38]: I offer that in a resolution.

3365
04:10:11,133 --> 04:10:25,011
[SPEAKER_38]: I would ask, I know you have a million things as committee of the whole, Mr. President, but I would ask at some point we create a committee of the whole meeting to address this very important issue on behalf of the residents of this community.

3366
04:10:26,633 --> 04:10:27,575
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

3367
04:10:30,097 --> 04:10:31,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Caraviello.

3368
04:10:31,257 --> 04:10:32,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3369
04:10:32,138 --> 04:10:34,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I thank Councilor Marks for bringing this up.

3370
04:10:34,278 --> 04:10:43,061
[SPEAKER_02]: If the council wouldn't mind, if we could amend this to also look into the boarding houses in the communities, in this community.

3371
04:10:43,702 --> 04:10:50,204
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be surprised how many boarding houses we have and the amount of incidents that happen at these boarding houses also.

3372
04:10:51,084 --> 04:10:56,366
[SPEAKER_02]: So if Councilor Marks wouldn't mind also to include this boarding houses in this also.

3373
04:10:58,729 --> 04:11:00,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

3374
04:11:02,092 --> 04:11:03,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears.

3375
04:11:04,353 --> 04:11:05,354
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3376
04:11:05,374 --> 04:11:10,458
[SPEAKER_34]: If Councilor Marks wouldn't mind an amendment as well, just to add the diversity director to that committee of the whole.

3377
04:11:15,942 --> 04:11:16,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

3378
04:11:16,863 --> 04:11:17,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

3379
04:11:19,265 --> 04:11:20,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

3380
04:11:22,247 --> 04:11:24,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like there's no hands raised here.

3381
04:11:24,769 --> 04:11:26,531
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of

3382
04:11:27,827 --> 04:11:40,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Council of marks as amended by consular vice-president Caraviello consular bears and seconded by Cosco Kelly Clark Artemis, please call the roll Can I ask a quick question before I call the roll?

3383
04:11:41,353 --> 04:11:43,273
[SPEAKER_29]: Absolutely Council marks.

3384
04:11:43,754 --> 04:11:44,834
[SPEAKER_29]: Are you amending the paper?

3385
04:11:44,854 --> 04:11:47,815
[SPEAKER_29]: Are you referring the paper to committee the whole for scheduling?

3386
04:11:50,877 --> 04:11:51,557
[SPEAKER_29]: Referring okay

3387
04:11:52,298 --> 04:11:57,700
[SPEAKER_29]: So the paper is referred and then the amendments came from Vice President Caraviello and Councilor Bears on that.

3388
04:11:57,760 --> 04:11:58,880
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, thank you.

3389
04:12:03,521 --> 04:12:04,382
[SPEAKER_29]: Here comes the roll call.

3390
04:12:04,822 --> 04:12:05,522
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears.

3391
04:12:07,062 --> 04:12:07,422
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3392
04:12:08,423 --> 04:12:09,423
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello.

3393
04:12:09,523 --> 04:12:09,803
Yes.

3394
04:12:10,863 --> 04:12:11,444
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight.

3395
04:12:11,524 --> 04:12:11,724
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3396
04:12:12,624 --> 04:12:13,224
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks.

3397
04:12:13,444 --> 04:12:13,664
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3398
04:12:14,584 --> 04:12:15,285
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell.

3399
04:12:15,645 --> 04:12:15,945
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3400
04:12:16,685 --> 04:12:17,465
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli.

3401
04:12:17,505 --> 04:12:17,565
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3402
04:12:18,906 --> 04:12:19,586
[SPEAKER_29]: President Falco.

3403
04:12:19,980 --> 04:12:22,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, the motion passes.

3404
04:12:22,621 --> 04:12:38,026
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-557 offered by Councilor Bears, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request an update from the city administration on the status of the 2020 census and how our current response rate will affect future funding allocations to the city of Medford, Councilor Bears.

3405
04:12:38,206 --> 04:12:39,087
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3406
04:12:39,867 --> 04:12:50,476
[SPEAKER_34]: I think I saw on Councilor Morell posted today that the city is around 71.2% or 71.8% response rate.

3407
04:12:52,137 --> 04:12:58,963
[SPEAKER_34]: That's 28% short of where we need to be in terms of having a full count in this 2020 census.

3408
04:12:59,683 --> 04:13:06,969
[SPEAKER_34]: We are eight days away from the end of the census now that the Trump administration has shortened the time that the census will occur.

3409
04:13:08,730 --> 04:13:23,298
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, to be completely honest, talking to census experts, there's a deep concern that this entire census process will be flawed, but given that it's entirely possible that it will be certified and be the official result, the goal of this is to

3410
04:13:24,418 --> 04:13:45,651
[SPEAKER_34]: ask the city administration, say we were at 72 or 75 or 80%, and I'm leaving that up to them, what would the impact of that low response rate be in terms of any federal funding, state funding, and other ways that we are bound by the census in the different funding streams that we have for the city of Medford.

3411
04:13:46,391 --> 04:13:48,353
[SPEAKER_34]: So that's the intent here, and I would move approval.

3412
04:13:49,853 --> 04:13:50,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

3413
04:13:50,934 --> 04:13:52,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions, comments from the council?

3414
04:13:52,415 --> 04:13:53,676
[SPEAKER_43]: Second the motion.

3415
04:13:54,833 --> 04:13:57,635
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion, let's see, no one has their hands raised.

3416
04:13:57,716 --> 04:14:01,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Knight, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

3417
04:14:06,463 --> 04:14:07,043
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears.

3418
04:14:07,384 --> 04:14:07,724
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3419
04:14:09,926 --> 04:14:10,827
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Caraviello.

3420
04:14:11,047 --> 04:14:11,307
Yes.

3421
04:14:12,088 --> 04:14:12,608
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight.

3422
04:14:12,989 --> 04:14:13,209
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

3423
04:14:13,949 --> 04:14:14,550
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks.

3424
04:14:14,810 --> 04:14:15,070
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

3425
04:14:15,911 --> 04:14:16,512
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Morell.

3426
04:14:16,812 --> 04:14:17,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

3427
04:14:17,873 --> 04:14:18,693
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli.

3428
04:14:18,994 --> 04:14:19,194
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3429
04:14:20,792 --> 04:14:22,595
[SPEAKER_06]: 7 the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

3430
04:14:22,615 --> 04:14:23,396
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

3431
04:14:23,416 --> 04:14:35,153
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-558 offered by Council of Mayors be a result that the Medford City Council requests an update from the Department of Public Works on the condition of pavement and line painting on Rivers Edge Drive.

3432
04:14:36,014 --> 04:14:36,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Council of Mayors.

3433
04:14:37,062 --> 04:14:38,082
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3434
04:14:39,363 --> 04:14:48,305
[SPEAKER_34]: So Rivers Edge Drive over in the eastern most part of the city, some of it is in pretty good condition, some of it is in less than ideal condition.

3435
04:14:49,725 --> 04:14:51,766
[SPEAKER_34]: And really this is just an intent to get an update.

3436
04:14:51,866 --> 04:14:59,148
[SPEAKER_34]: I have been informed that our neighbors in Malden do have, I believe, some funding to redo what they're calling

3437
04:15:00,188 --> 04:15:03,090
[SPEAKER_34]: commercial street, which then turns into River's Edge Drive here in Medford.

3438
04:15:03,690 --> 04:15:12,475
[SPEAKER_34]: So I just want an update to see if there's anything in the works to repave or repaint or in any way improve the condition of River's Edge Drive.

3439
04:15:14,216 --> 04:15:15,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

3440
04:15:16,057 --> 04:15:18,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions for the Council?

3441
04:15:19,098 --> 04:15:19,979
[SPEAKER_06]: No one has their hands raised.

3442
04:15:20,399 --> 04:15:23,861
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Knight, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

3443
04:15:28,396 --> 04:15:28,617
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3444
04:15:28,637 --> 04:15:28,937
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3445
04:15:29,198 --> 04:15:29,438
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3446
04:15:40,677 --> 04:15:41,377
[SPEAKER_29]: President Falco.

3447
04:15:41,437 --> 04:15:43,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 70 affirmatives, negative, the motion passes.

3448
04:15:43,738 --> 04:15:59,141
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-559 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council be provided with an update on the current financial circumstances and projections following the close of the first quarter of the fiscal year at the second meeting in October.

3449
04:16:00,121 --> 04:16:00,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

3450
04:16:04,962 --> 04:16:06,223
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

3451
04:16:08,404 --> 04:16:31,287
[SPEAKER_42]: The idea was raised as part of a committee report during our budget discussions, something I brought up when we were looking at the projections during the COVID-19 circumstance and the budget deliberations relative to the anticipated forecasted revenues that were going to be coming in through the various departments that are revenue generating.

3452
04:16:31,927 --> 04:16:34,348
[SPEAKER_42]: the building department and their building permits, for example.

3453
04:16:35,608 --> 04:16:43,631
[SPEAKER_42]: And when we sat down with the finance director and we saw what the trends were and what the projections were, we took a vote.

3454
04:16:44,011 --> 04:16:46,812
[SPEAKER_42]: And that vote was to have quarterly meetings.

3455
04:16:47,532 --> 04:16:54,698
[SPEAKER_42]: with the finance director to update us on where we are currently in terms of collections and where our projections are.

3456
04:16:55,659 --> 04:17:00,744
[SPEAKER_42]: And this is a follow-up to that recommendation that was made during the budget hearings back in June.

3457
04:17:01,424 --> 04:17:06,649
[SPEAKER_42]: I'd ask my council colleagues to support it as the first quarter was July, August, and September.

3458
04:17:07,149 --> 04:17:09,391
[SPEAKER_42]: And September is going to be closing at the end of the week.

3459
04:17:09,411 --> 04:17:11,393
[SPEAKER_42]: Our next meeting is October.

3460
04:17:12,934 --> 04:17:13,474
[SPEAKER_42]: Sixth is it?

3461
04:17:13,715 --> 04:17:14,295
[SPEAKER_42]: You are correct.

3462
04:17:14,375 --> 04:17:23,239
[SPEAKER_42]: And the meeting after that I'd ask that the finance director be prepared to appear before the council at a council meeting and give us an update as to where we are on forecast and projected revenues.

3463
04:17:24,320 --> 04:17:25,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

3464
04:17:27,401 --> 04:17:28,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions, comments from the council?

3465
04:17:30,543 --> 04:17:31,523
[SPEAKER_06]: No one has their hands raised.

3466
04:17:31,544 --> 04:17:35,646
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

3467
04:17:39,748 --> 04:17:40,328
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears.

3468
04:17:41,288 --> 04:17:41,549
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3469
04:17:42,699 --> 04:17:42,819
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3470
04:17:42,899 --> 04:17:42,999
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3471
04:17:43,019 --> 04:17:43,079
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3472
04:17:57,475 --> 04:18:00,536
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-560 by Councilor Morell and Councilor Pierres.

3473
04:18:00,617 --> 04:18:18,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the city administration use all available resources to ensure addiction and substance use recovery meetings are supported during the COVID-19 state of emergency while observing state emergency order limitations and by exploring outdoor locations.

3474
04:18:19,045 --> 04:18:28,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it further resolved that the city administration publish a list of in-person meetings that are currently being held in Medford and surrounding communities for those in recovery and seeking support.

3475
04:18:30,623 --> 04:18:31,604
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3476
04:18:31,804 --> 04:18:48,520
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, this resolution is pretty self explanatory, but this was raised through a number of channels that because of the, uh, indoor gathering limits, um, and another number of other limits, a lot of, uh, recovery meetings have essentially kind of disappeared or stopped happening during the state emergency orders in a pandemic.

3477
04:18:48,681 --> 04:18:53,245
[SPEAKER_12]: This is, you know, some, um, organizations don't have zoom licenses.

3478
04:18:53,605 --> 04:18:55,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Some are at the mercy of the

3479
04:18:55,647 --> 04:18:58,349
[SPEAKER_12]: where the meetings are usually held and they're not reopening just yet.

3480
04:18:58,989 --> 04:19:10,695
[SPEAKER_12]: So I did reach out to the outreach and prevention team and they're aware of this issue and they did offer that they would do everything in their power to support 12-step programs that are seeking to meet as long as they follow state orders.

3481
04:19:11,296 --> 04:19:16,859
[SPEAKER_12]: But I did just want to raise this to ensure that this is top of mind for the administration and they're doing all they can to support local

3482
04:19:17,279 --> 04:19:25,278
[SPEAKER_12]: who are in recovery and seeking recovery right now because it's really making a massive impact on these meetings and people seeking help.

3483
04:19:25,318 --> 04:19:27,082
[SPEAKER_12]: So I move approval.

3484
04:19:29,585 --> 04:19:30,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

3485
04:19:30,506 --> 04:19:31,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Bears.

3486
04:19:31,547 --> 04:19:32,427
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3487
04:19:32,807 --> 04:19:47,118
[SPEAKER_34]: And I would just add two quick things, which is, number one, that the pandemic and the mental health effects associated with the pandemic and the pandemic restrictions are making this problem worse, and that I think that this is incredibly apt during Recovery Awareness Month that we do this.

3488
04:19:47,819 --> 04:19:51,021
[SPEAKER_34]: So I have friends who deal with substance use disorder.

3489
04:19:51,041 --> 04:19:57,627
[SPEAKER_34]: I have some friends who've had a very hard time through COVID-19 and who would appreciate a meeting nearby that they could get to.

3490
04:19:57,947 --> 04:19:59,328
[SPEAKER_34]: So thank you, Mr. President.

3491
04:20:00,333 --> 04:20:01,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

3492
04:20:01,973 --> 04:20:02,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Layton.

3493
04:20:02,914 --> 04:20:06,174
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, I thank the councilors for bringing this resolution forward.

3494
04:20:07,174 --> 04:20:18,357
[SPEAKER_42]: I'd also, I think it's very important that we recognize the work of our Substance Abuse and Prevention Office and where they've come in such a short time since being created.

3495
04:20:18,397 --> 04:20:22,378
[SPEAKER_42]: The office has only been in effect now for maybe what, five years, six years?

3496
04:20:22,998 --> 04:20:28,099
[SPEAKER_42]: And the strides that they've made in this community in terms of education and outreach have been

3497
04:20:29,099 --> 04:20:36,501
[SPEAKER_42]: enumerable compared to where we were before to where we are today, the level of services that we offer as a city.

3498
04:20:37,341 --> 04:20:46,444
[SPEAKER_42]: But I think it's also important, Mr. President, to recognize that in the spirit of National Recovery Month, that this is a resolution that we must support this evening.

3499
04:20:46,804 --> 04:20:49,645
[SPEAKER_42]: And I wholeheartedly will vote entirely in favor of it this evening.

3500
04:20:51,045 --> 04:20:52,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Councilor Knight.

3501
04:20:52,786 --> 04:20:54,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

3502
04:20:56,567 --> 04:20:57,507
[SPEAKER_06]: We have, let's see.

3503
04:21:04,615 --> 04:21:06,656
[SPEAKER_06]: And that name and address for the record, please.

3504
04:21:06,676 --> 04:21:08,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Hendrick Giddeons, 14 Rita drive.

3505
04:21:08,596 --> 04:21:11,697
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to speak to this because I am in recovery. I've got 17 years under my belt, and now is the time we finally need to get more people into recovery.

3506
04:21:33,271 --> 04:21:50,900
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very strange to me that we would be just a couple of minutes ago, looking to figure out how to not have empathy for people in halfway houses and people who don't have enough money to move into an apartment who live in boarding houses.

3507
04:21:51,941 --> 04:21:59,345
[SPEAKER_14]: And to keep those people out while we're pretending to support people that are in recovery.

3508
04:22:02,317 --> 04:22:04,358
[SPEAKER_38]: Point of information, Mr. President.

3509
04:22:04,638 --> 04:22:07,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay... um, Councilor Marks.

3510
04:22:07,859 --> 04:22:11,541
[SPEAKER_38]: Uh, I didn't hear anyone say about keeping anyone out of this community.

3511
04:22:12,121 --> 04:22:21,125
[SPEAKER_38]: So, you know, if we're going to state things, Mr. President, we should accurately reflect what was stated and no one once said to keep anyone out of this community.

3512
04:22:21,485 --> 04:22:21,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

3513
04:22:24,926 --> 04:22:25,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Hendrick, please continue.

3514
04:22:26,947 --> 04:22:27,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

3515
04:22:28,528 --> 04:22:28,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Um,

3516
04:22:30,060 --> 04:22:32,881
[SPEAKER_14]: It's nice that I get to speak again.

3516
04:22:32,881 --> 04:22:33,000
[SPEAKER_38]: Says who?

3517
04:22:32,901 --> 04:22:56,248
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that it's very important for us at this time when people are out of work and they're without their support communities, either in churches or in meetings, or the people that they work with in person, in offices,

3518
04:22:57,088 --> 04:23:01,050
[SPEAKER_14]: to realize that we actually need to support people during this time.

3519
04:23:01,930 --> 04:23:13,075
[SPEAKER_14]: And a halfway house is the way people make the transition from being in rehab or in prison to rejoining the rest of society.

3520
04:23:13,675 --> 04:23:16,276
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's something that we need to have.

3521
04:23:17,276 --> 04:23:17,617
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we

3522
04:23:19,665 --> 04:23:31,134
[SPEAKER_14]: are interested in regulating that, we need to figure out how we can take care of the people that are in those houses as much as we are taking care of the other residents outside.

3523
04:23:31,154 --> 04:23:32,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

3524
04:23:33,055 --> 04:23:33,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

3525
04:23:33,476 --> 04:23:35,697
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

3526
04:23:39,120 --> 04:23:39,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.

3527
04:23:39,740 --> 04:23:47,967
[SPEAKER_06]: My computer died, so I just need to... Are there any other questions or comments?

3528
04:23:50,558 --> 04:23:52,698
[SPEAKER_34]: Motion to get the President a computer charger.

3529
04:23:55,299 --> 04:24:06,381
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Morell and Councilor Bears, seconded by Vice President Caraviello, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

3530
04:24:11,842 --> 04:24:12,483
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Bears?

3531
04:24:12,843 --> 04:24:13,123
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes.

3532
