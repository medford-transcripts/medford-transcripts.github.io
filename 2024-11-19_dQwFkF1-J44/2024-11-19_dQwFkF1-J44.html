    <p>[Richard Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=330.331s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=331.671s">As</a>  you know, Post 45 is <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=336.087s">has</a>  been there since 1919, and it's a community-based veterans organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=342.988s">And</a>  what we want to do now, in keeping with the times, is be able to serve a minimal amount of food to our members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=358.951s">And</a>  we've worked very hard to bring the place up to compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=365.973s">It</a>  has passed and we feel that this will help the morale of some of our veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=374.641s">Most</a>  of them are the average age now is about 70 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=378.884s">They</a>  don't get out very much and we do bring them in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=382.608s">And</a>  we want to make it comfortable for them and so they can enjoy themselves and have a hot dog or something of that nature.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=393.424s">That's</a>  great, so thank you, Mr. Martin. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=397.327s">Again,</a>  I've put in the American Legion post. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=402.652s">We</a>  appreciate everything you've done for our country and all the members, and I see that you've done everything that's required through our licensing department, so I move forward for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=414.321s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=415.322s">Second,</a>  Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=416.503s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=417.684s">In</a>  the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=424.93s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=426.05s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=428.331s">This</a>  is a very important paper to the membership of American Legion Post 45. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=432.233s">And</a>  in full disclosure, I've been a Sal in the past, a son of the American Legion member there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=437.374s">And</a>  what this paper does is it allows them to operate underneath the governor's guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=441.836s">The</a>  post has been shut down now since about St. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=444.637s">Patrick's</a>  Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=445.657s">And</a>  they haven't had the ability to generate any income whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=448.838s">And</a>  that coupled with the fact that this veteran's organization does provide great support services for young and old veterans here in the community of Medford and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=457.004s">That</a>  coupled with the fact that the American Legion Post 45 and its membership are always the first ones to step up when the city of Medford needs something, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=465.509s">If</a>  you look to election day on September 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=468.991s">When</a>  the Lawrence Memorial Hospital was unable to host us for our election proceedings, the first people to step up to the plate were Richard Mott and Bobby Miller in American Legion Post 45. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=478.814s">And</a>  when we celebrate our Memorial Day ceremonies, Mr. President, and we all go down to <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=486.016s">Oak</a>  Grove Cemetery and we sit there and we listen to the beautiful presentations put on by our veterans organizations and as we sit there we see those flags all across the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=495.973s">American</a>  Legion Post 45 is the group that coordinates. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=499.994s">The</a>  placing of those flags on our veterans' grave markers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=502.616s">So</a>  it's very important, Mr. President, that we recognize the work and the partnership that the American Legion has provided the citizens and the residents in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=509.821s">And</a>  I think it's very important for us to adopt and embrace this opportunity for them to get a common victuals license so that they have the opportunity to reopen and generate some revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=518.887s">And</a>  also allow the membership, the opportunity to come back in and to continue their mutual support relationship that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=526.011s">When</a>  we look at the agenda later on this evening, we have a paper talking about substance abuse and addiction recovery services and the ability to have meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=534.154s">And</a>  veterans organizations, although they don't necessarily hold meetings per se, are a great spot for veterans to congregate, to get together, and to talk about their shared mutual experiences and how to go through some of the struggles that they're having. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=545.438s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, this is a paper that I support wholeheartedly, and I'd ask my council colleagues to also join me in supporting it.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=551.36s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=554.341s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=556.054s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=557.195s">I,</a>  too, want to reiterate my support for Post 45. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=561.479s">They've</a>  been longstanding members of this community, very active and involved in this community, and good neighbors for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=570.127s">And</a>  I stand here tonight, Mr. President, to support them as they've supported members of this community for the last several decades, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=577.754s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=578.274s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=581.517s">Anybody</a>  else? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=583.063s">Okay,</a>  so on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, Chairperson of Licensing, seconded by Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=590.929s">Clerk</a>  Hurtubise, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=694.523s">Mr.</a>  President, I can hear Heather. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=699.328s">So</a>  it might be the same technical issue we had a minute ago.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=702.491s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=703.532s">Heather,</a>  can you try again? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=720.299s">Okay,</a>  I apologize, we're having some technical difficulties, so we'll just need a minute.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=723.321s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=730.728s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=778.813s">Okay,</a>  why don't we try that?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=783.895s">Heather,</a>  if you wouldn't mind, and I apologize for the inconvenience, could you just try hanging up and coming back into the call? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=795.4s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=896.727s">And</a>  let's see, your sign was denied, if I'm correct?</p>

    <p>[Powers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=902.453s">Yes,</a>  I believe it's two inches past <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=908.164s">and</a>  my designer had done that pretty much to stay with the other signs that were in station landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=916.23s">I</a>  guess they all ended up petitioning for the same type of variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=921.695s">And</a>  so it's kind of keeping with the same look. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=924.577s">We</a>  had applied for 32 inches depth compared to 30 inches.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=930.322s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=932.584s">Any</a>  questions from the council?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=935.606s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=937.959s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=938.979s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=939.519s">It</a>  looks like there are only a few inches over the allowed sided, so I don't see a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=955.064s">So,</a>  I motion for approval.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=957.764s">Okay,</a>  the motion of Vice President Caraviello, seconded by- Second. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=962.646s">Council</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=964.909s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=965.97s">Mr.</a>  President, at the end of our packet, there's a letter by Mr. Paris, and I think it's a very good explanation of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=973.2s">Dear</a>  members of the city council, regarding our sign request for Liv's Juice and a Kai bar located at 56 Stations Landing, my understanding is that we're allowed two feet of projection. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=982.512s">Since</a>  our 24 inch sign is circular, the total square foot is just 3.16 square feet, as opposed to the total four square foot sign that's allowed by the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=991.155s">The</a>  mounting of the sign is flush to the building and would look very funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=993.776s">And</a>  as a result, we're asking for four additional inches of projection for the standoffs to make it fit within the neighborhood and uphold the great look there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1001.358s">Mr.</a>  President, I personally find a circular sign more aesthetically pleasing than a big square or rectangular sign sticking off the side of a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1007.541s">I</a>  think Mr. Paris has given us a great explanation, and although it doesn't present a significant hardship, it certainly does present some curb appeal issues that this council has discussed in the past, and I support this paper wholeheartedly.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1019.306s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1020.906s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1023.267s">If</a>  you can, is this line, I'm not seeing if it's illuminated.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1029.704s">Mr.</a>  Parris?</p>

    <p>[Powers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1030.244s">It</a>  is internally lit, yes, that's correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1035.065s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1036.605s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Parris. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1038.446s">Any</a>  other questions from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1041.946s">Okay,</a>  on the motion of Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1047.007s">Seconded</a>  by, Clerk, would you give him a second?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1053.368s">It</a>  was Councilor Morell.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1054.529s">It</a>  was Councilor Morell? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1055.289s">Okay,</a>  I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1057.972s">I</a>  thought Councilor Bears had the second, but we said it at the same time.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1062.776s">Okay,</a>  so Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1064.697s">Let's</a>  see, we have Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1066.438s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1069.541s">Mr.</a>  President, does the owner of the property have plans to turn the sign off after hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1077.327s">Mr.</a>  Parris, can you comment on that?</p>

    <p>[Costas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1080.013s">I'm</a>  sorry, did you say the owner of the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1082.074s">I</a>  believe ours is separate.</p>

    <p>[Powers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1087.915s">But</a>  we can program however need be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1089.836s">So</a>  whether it's for during business hours or from dusk till dawn, whatever we need to, we can program it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1097.758s">I</a>  would state, Mr. President, to be consistent, and I've voted like this in the past, that the sign be turned off when the business is not in operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1106.772s">Okay,</a>  are you writing that as an amendment to the- I would like to hear what my other council colleagues would like to say on that, and I would have that as an amendment, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1115.217s">Okay,</a>  so that is an amendment by Councilor Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1119.519s">And</a>  we'll get some, would any of the councils like to comment on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1122.841s">Councilor</a>  Bears?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1124.551s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1125.571s">I'm</a>  fine with that, as long as it's within the control of the business, as long as the property owner isn't the one who controls the light switch. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1134.114s">We're</a>  just having a little bit of feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1135.575s">I</a>  think there were too many mics turned on, so that's directed to you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1140.617s">I</a>  think we're fine now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1141.497s">It</a>  looks like they're off. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1142.897s">Yeah,</a>  we're fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1143.698s">Great,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1144.638s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1148.67s">I</a>  know our ordinance speaks to the signs not being illuminated after 10 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1152.833s">Anyhow,</a>  what are the hours of the gentleman's operations?</p>

    <p>[Powers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1156.456s">We</a>  actually have two sets of hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1159.918s">Our</a>  fall hours just went into effect where we're actually closing at 4 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1164.482s">But</a>  our summer hours, we close at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1168.785s">But</a>  I can tell you that just walking up and down Station Landing at night, I believe that a lot of the businesses</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1190.485s">So</a>  I would ask with consistency, Mr. President, that the light be turned off. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1194.187s">If</a>  the audience is 10, that's fine.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1196.908s">But</a>  whatever the practices at stations landing, I mean, I'm not opposed to the measure at all, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1201.31s">I</a>  don't want to come across- I just want to be consistent, because I know when station landing came aboard, we spent a lot of time working on the signage to make sure that it was aesthetically pleasing, because there are a number of residents that live in station landing.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1216.476s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1216.816s">And</a>  we have to be mindful of that as well.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1218.757s">So</a>  is the amendment, I just want to be clear, so is the amendment that the sign gets turned off when the rest of the signs at the stations get turned off?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1428.922s">Yes,</a>  we do have a photo in a package here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1433.25s">Yes,</a>  we have a question from, we have Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1437.066s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President, again, at the end of this application, there's also a letter dated March 3rd, 2020 from Mr. DeSilva at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1443.868s">I</a>  guess March 3rd is when he requested his appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1447.188s">And</a>  it reads, the purpose of these proposed awnings is to provide protection from the environment, enhance the appeal of the car wash, and instruct customers of free vacuum services in an attractive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1457.031s">Despite</a>  the weather conditions, customers will be comfortable vacuuming their vehicles under the shade and shelter of the awning. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1462.032s">And</a>  the awnings are not only to benefit the customer's comfort, but also create a more attractive facade. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1466.294s">Finally,</a>  the awnings instruct the customers where the free vacuums are located and create a clear space to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1472.516s">So</a>  Mr. President, it seems like they're seeking 13 awnings, one over each vacuum that look like to be canvas awnings that aren't internally illuminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1484.3s">But</a>  I do believe that they would have certain public safety benefit instructing <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1492.033s">where</a>  the free vacuums are in a location like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1494.814s">I</a>  believe this is the old Randy's Car Wash on Middlesex Ave, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1499.216s">They've</a>  always done a pretty good job over there at Randy's, and I don't think that the new operator would be any less successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1506.879s">And</a>  I can certainly support a reversal on the sign denial, but is 13 really the number that we want to approve, I guess is the question.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1522.255s">If</a>  you have a comment, we'll hear from some of the councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1524.618s">Councilor</a>  Knight, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1525.699s">Let's</a>  see, we have Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1528.483s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1529.684s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1530.205s">Thank</a>  you, President Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1531.407s">I</a>  know my concern also falls with the number of signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1537.173s">To</a>  have one sign that says free vacuums, I think we can all see, we all know the location, we all see the vacuums. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1544.337s">But</a>  to have 13 signs, I'm just a little nervous of what would be added after that on those awnings, or what's hung on those awnings and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1555.484s">So</a>  I'd like to hear what my fellow councilors have to say, but I just think this might be a little excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1564.129s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1565.196s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1567.117s">We</a>  have Councilor Marks, and then we have Councilor Bears, and then Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1573.158s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1574.819s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and I happen to frequent this car wash where I live right up the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1582.441s">And</a>  let me tell you, there's no mistaking that there's free vacuum at that particular car wash. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1589.483s">There</a>  is banners on the fence, there are signs everywhere saying free car wash. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1596.866s">You</a>  can't help but drive by, I mean a free vacuum, and notice that there's free vacuuming there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1603.869s">I</a>  would also state that these particular awnings, according to the letter we received that Councilor Knight just read, state that the awnings come off the building two feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1616.129s">So</a>  to state that this would be comfortable vacuuming their vehicles under the shade and shelter of the awning, I don't know how you create shade and shelter of a two foot awning coming off the side of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1630.914s">Because</a>  the vacuum is in front of the car, which is a pretty big, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1636.956s">piece</a>  of equipment, there's no way that provides shelter for anyone that's vacuuming, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1644.243s">I</a>  think the awnings may be a nice addition to the building without signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1649.868s">So</a>  if the gentleman wanted to put 12 awnings and maybe one or two free vacuum, or maybe even three depending on the wish of the council, I would be amendable to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1663.461s">Because</a>  I think the building could use, it's just a squared off building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1668.368s">Aesthetically</a>  speaking, it's not that pleasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1671.232s">Maybe</a>  these awnings will make it look more pleasing, but to have it on each awning, Mr. President, is overkill. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1679.364s">And</a>  it doesn't serve the purpose of shade or shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1682.886s">And</a>  so I would put in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that out of the request for 13 canvas awnings, that we allow 13 awnings, but only three with signage that states free vacuum.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1703.756s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1704.516s">I</a>  would second that motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1707.839s">For</a>  it's often in the form of a I guess it would be a restriction correct counsel, right?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1714.522s">The</a>  second bike was that Councilor Knight Excuse me So one minute please so we have a motion by Councilor Mark seconded by a council night to allow the 13 awnings But only three with signage am I correct correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1732.491s">Okay</a>  quick her to be you had that Yes</p>

    <p>[Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1737.23s">So</a>  move Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1761.713s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1762.673s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1764.474s">Also,</a>  if I could, and I realize the banners are probably up temporarily because it doesn't really, other than the banners, there's nothing else that says free vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1776.217s">I</a>  would hope as soon as the awnings go up that those temporary banners come off that are on the fence and around the property, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1788.953s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1790.654s">So</a>  we have a number of other Councilors that want to speak on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1793.536s">We</a>  have, let's see, I have up next Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1796.858s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1797.978s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1799.019s">Councilor</a>  Marks and the petitioner answered my question, so I'm all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1802.361s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1802.781s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1802.961s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1804.702s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1806.743s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1807.644s">Similarly,</a>  I thank Councilor Marks for bringing forward that language because I wholeheartedly agree and support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1813.728s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1815.572s">Thank</a>  you, Council Member.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1838.462s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1840.983s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1848.761s">Can</a>  I interrupt for a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1850.482s">I'm</a>  unclear, I got Councilor Marks' original motion to approve the 13 audits, but only allow three with the signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1858.945s">Does</a>  the motion also include that the temporary planners come down when the audits go up, or is that just a request?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1866.608s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1874.498s">This</a>  may be a question for the building commissioner in his office, but I believe any banners in the city, Mr. President, have to be permitted and approved for businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1889.006s">And</a>  I believe it's on a temporary basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1891.107s">I'm</a>  not sure if these banners are approved or if they, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1897.31s">But</a>  I would ask as part of this paper that they be taken down as soon as the awnings go up.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1903.988s">It's</a>  more of a request.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1905.749s">Right,</a>  I'm not sure if he has current approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1907.771s">Maybe</a>  the owner of the property can state whether or not he got approval for the bayonets.</p>

    <p>[Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1913.136s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1914.917s">I'm</a>  the one who all the signs for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1918.14s">And</a>  I'm responsible for all the signs, all the bayonets, for all the prestige collage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1923.444s">I</a>  do all the advertise for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1925.946s">And</a>  I'm going to make sure all the bayonets come out soon and install the bayonets. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1931.803s">I</a>  make the installation and take all the banners out. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1936.186s">That's</a>  good, that's good Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1938.108s">I'm</a>  gonna take all the banners out. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1939.389s">As</a>  soon as I put up, put up the orders.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1947.614s">Yeah,</a>  so we can leave that language in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1948.935s">He's</a>  committing to the language anyway, so we can leave that language in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1953.219s">The</a>  banners come down as soon as the signage goes up.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1956.241s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1956.881s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1958.262s">Thank</a>  you Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1960.68s">Okay,</a>  on the motion of Councilor Mark, seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1964.563s">Clerk</a>  Hurtubise, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2239.513s">I'll</a>  accept that answer, Mr. President, and if they do come back, I may not be supportive of an additional freestanding sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2248.381s">So</a>  as long as the petitioner knows that.</p>

    <p>[Dutko]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2250.342s">I</a>  will make note of that and relay that back to the hotel.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2275.444s">Right,</a>  because you got the old margaritas on one side, the other hotel, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2281.467s">So</a>  they're not facing any of the, because they're pretty big, 150 foot square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2286.089s">All</a>  right, sounds good. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2286.949s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2310.28s">Yeah,</a>  so the north side of the building, is that what you're saying?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2318.105s">I</a>  think it's the south elevation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2326.134s">I</a>  mean, I think it's the one that was approved by Wright faces the building that Margarita's used to be in.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2344.042s">There</a>  seems to be some concern whether or not, I think, is it maybe the north side of the building faces a residential building, if I'm correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2354.415s">We're</a>  going to take a look right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2355.416s">One</a>  minute, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2356.857s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2357.658s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2363.163s">There</a>  is an ebb and torry on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2366.205s">Who</a>  said he could address this question?</p>

    <p>[Tormey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2380.635s">you.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2380.815s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2380.975s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2396.041s">Evan</a>  Tormey. I work for the developer of the hotel. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2398.703s">I</a>  also represented the developer on the AC hotel next door, which does have a sign facing north currently more at the elevation of the residential building at 75 Station Landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2410.332s">This</a>  new building will block that sign that is illuminated on 95 Station Landing, the AC hotel, from being visible to the residents of 75 Station Landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2421.48s">And</a>  this new sign is on the 9th floor of this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2425.663s">The</a>  building next door, I believe, is only 6 stories at 75 Station Landing, so it'll be well above. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2431.948s">It's</a>  more intended to be visible for people traveling south on the Fellsway.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2435.932s">It</a>  does face the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2438.454s">Maybe</a>  3 stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2438.814s">Well,</a>  it does face the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2441.436s">And</a>  that's your call.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2454.951s">Does</a>  anyone, anyone care to comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2456.732s">Any</a>  consuls, any concerns? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2458.273s">Sorry?</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2458.434s">Mr.</a>  President, in the past, if I may.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2462.576s">Oh,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2463.797s">Consul,</a>  one minute, Consul Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2466.299s">Consul</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2467.039s">In</a>  the past, Mr. President, when a circumstance like this has arose, what we've done is put a 30, 60, or 90 day review on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2474.444s">I</a>  don't know if that's something we wanna do in this situation or circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2478.206s">I</a>  haven't gotten any complaints <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2481.328s">from</a>  anybody regarding the sign at 75 stations landing to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2486.051s">So</a>  I don't find it to be a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2488.432s">However,</a>  if it does become an issue because of the action of this council, I think that we should absolutely have the ability to give it a review to make sure that we're not disrupting anybody's quality of life that resides in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2499.298s">Well,</a>  at the same time, still supporting the application of the Fairfield Marriott Hotels. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2504.703s">We</a>  all understand the benefits that having an additional hotel in our community is going to bring to us financially. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2509.348s">And</a>  historically, they've been a good partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2512.03s">Our</a>  other two hotels have been great partners here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2515.234s">So</a>  I don't want to, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2520.163s">I</a>  don't want to claim nefarious intent, but at the same time, I think it's important that we protect the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2524.505s">So</a>  I would offer a 30 and 60 day review on the paper and move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2529.688s">For</a>  the sign only facing 75 stations only.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2533.569s">So,</a>  Clerk Hurtubise, I'm not sure if you got that amendment by Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2538.372s">I'm</a>  sorry, I don't know if 75 is the address, but the north facing sign abutting the residential property.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2544.474s">Do</a>  you have that, Clerk Hurtubise? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2546.655s">Working</a>  on it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2554.697s">Councilmarks</a>  one minute, please.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2556.078s">We</a>  have actually council beers and then let me read this back Yes Councilman is offering an amendment requesting a 30 to 60 day review for the north-facing sign that it is a budding resident the residential property.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2570.035s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2570.355s">I</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2575.925s">Okay,</a>  so that is an amendment by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2578.267s">We</a>  have Councilor Bears and Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2580.128s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2581.228s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2582.089s">Through</a>  you to the petitioner, will these illuminated signs be shut off at 10 p.m.?</p>

    <p>[Dutko]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2590.634s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2590.814s">Duggo?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2592.616s">Perhaps</a>  Evan could address that?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2601.641s">Evan,</a>  are you still on the call?</p>

    <p>[Tormey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2605.336s">He's</a>  still on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2606.597s">Yes,</a>  I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2607.538s">Sorry,</a>  I was muted. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2609.0s">The</a>  hotel operates 24 hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2613.504s">We</a>  have guests arriving at all hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2615.907s">The</a>  AC hotel next door, which we own and operate, was therefore permitted to have the signs illuminated 24 hours a day or from dusk till dawn for the safety of our guests. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2628.139s">I'm</a>  not aware of any complaints regarding the illumination of that signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2631.742s">And</a>  we do, as mentioned, have signs on that building facing the residential structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2636.807s">These</a>  are not glaring signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2639.509s">They</a>  are illuminated, but there's no glare coming from them.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2644.834s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2646.235s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2652.12s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2653.521s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2656.178s">Are</a>  they able to control the lumens on the signage itself?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2666.766s">Eben,</a>  are you able to answer that question?</p>

    <p>[Tormey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2669.488s">Yeah,</a>  I'm not aware of an ability to control the lumens. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2674.052s">There's</a>  not a dimmer on the signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2677.774s">They</a>  are <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2680.126s">It's</a>  fairly unobtrusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2681.967s">I</a>  think it's going to be a similar sign output to what we already have on the AC hotel. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2687.029s">And</a>  while it's illuminated, it's not something that causes any discomfort to the eyes or irritates neighboring residents that I'm aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2696.133s">We've</a>  not received any complaints through the city or from any neighbors.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2700.074s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2701.855s">So</a>  we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2704.716s">If</a>  we put a 30 or 60 day review, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2708.738s">And</a>  after 30 or 60 days, this council sees fit that we received a certain number of complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2715.905s">I'm</a>  sure the hotel wouldn't want to remove a $50,000, $60,000 sign based on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2722.751s">So</a>  I would ask that as part of this, Mr. President, that they put up a sign that they can control the Lumens. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2729.798s">And</a>  that way, if there is a concern, we may be able to go back to the owner of the property and state that the brightness is bothering people or whatever it might be, and have some flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2741.862s">And</a>  that's the only reason why I bring it up, Mr. President, because once the sign goes up, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2746.324s">And</a>  if we do vote at a later date to take it down, that would be of great hardship, I'm sure, to the petitioner, and I wouldn't want to put them in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2755.47s">So</a>  maybe if they can look at a sign that they can control the lumens, we'll be able to address any issues, because that would be my issue, the brightness of the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2764.356s">I</a>  understand the petitioner saying they're not that bright, but if they're able to get a sign where they can control that one in particular, not all of them, that one in particular I think would be helpful for not only them, but for us as a council.</p>

    <p>[Tormey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2778.845s">to</a>  the sign manufacturer and to that side, knowing that this is a concern of the Council and potentially neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2788.847s">something</a>  that we don't typically do, but I'm sure that we can make that accommodation so that we don't have to turn off the sign permanently. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2796.708s">We'd</a>  rather be able to dim it to a level that was acceptable to the neighbors.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2800.865s">So</a>  I'd ask that that be part of the recommendation, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2803.887s">So</a>  why that is an amendment as well?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2805.488s">An</a>  amendment that the sign contain a dimming aspect on the north, facing the north side. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2810.771s">So</a>  I'd ask Councilor Knight to amend his motion.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2816.195s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2816.515s">So</a>  do you have that amendment as well, Clerk Hurtubise? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2820.057s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2820.678s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2821.098s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2821.598s">Councilor</a>  Marks, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2823.7s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2825.465s">So</a>  Mr. President, just to be clear, this application before us is just for the permit to reverse the sign denial. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2832.808s">And</a>  any type of relief sought by the applicant relative to hours of operation outside of the ordinance and its 7 AM to 10 PM requirements would have to be sought under a different cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2844.131s">That's</a>  not going to be covered under the aspect of the vote that we're taking this evening.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2852.622s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2853.383s">Any</a>  other questions or comments from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2857.486s">Okay,</a>  I don't see anybody's hand raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2861.81s">I</a>  think we're good here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2862.73s">So</a>  on the motion of Vice President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Morell, as amended by Councilor Knight and Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2873.359s">Clerk,</a>  please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3047.503s">My</a>  name is Diana Cuddy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3048.483s">I</a>  live at 21 Judith Lane, Mansfield, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3050.444s">I'm</a>  here representing Boston Gas doing business as National Grid, requesting permission to install approximately 650 feet of a new four-inch plastic gas main extension, a small piece of it starting on Williams Street, going into Somerville, which is most of the length of the main extension, and then going up Medford Street to service a new construction at 87 Medford Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3075.888s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3077.609s">So</a>  let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3080.732s">And</a>  if I may, I'm going to just read that this was approved by the chief engineer with the following conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3086.397s">The</a>  engineering division recommends that the grant of location be approved with the following conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3090.82s">Number</a>  one, the grant of location is limited to the approximately 60 feet of gas main in one service located in Medford that is part of the larger project described in the GOL documents as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3103.951s">To</a>  install and maintain approximately 650 feet of a new 4-inch plastic main extension from the existing 4-inch plastic main in Williams Street going on to Broadway and to the service location in Medford Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3118.403s">Number</a>  two, before starting work, the contractor shall notify DigSafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3122.987s">It</a>  shall obtain all applicable permits from the engineering division. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3126.669s">The</a>  project must obtain a street opening permit pursuant to section 74-141 of the city ordinances prior to commencing work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3135.834s">Medford</a>  Street was rebuilt within the last five. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3139.602s">years</a>  and is restricted from receiving a SOP without direct approval from the Commissioner of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3147.207s">At</a>  a minimum, the SOP application must include a street restoration plan for review and approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3154.232s">At</a>  a minimum, the street restoration plan must include curb-to-curb paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3159.397s">The</a>  SOP application must also include a traffic management plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3164.561s">Number</a>  three, no other utility structures, conduits, duct banks, pipes, or any other appearances are adversely impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3173.809s">The</a>  National Grid shall ensure that all sewer water and drain lines are marked prior to any excavation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3180.935s">Any</a>  disturbed concrete sidewalk panels shall be replaced in kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3186.079s">Asphalt</a>  must be replaced with asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3189.38s">There</a>  are multiple broken concrete panels clustered at the vicinity of the point of entry for the gas service. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3196.282s">This</a>  cluster should be replaced as part of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3199.463s">Number</a>  four, the sidewalk and street restoration shall be done in consultation with the engineering division and per the requirements of the approved street opening permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3209.525s">Number</a>  five, pavement markings including the hatch pattern must be restored. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3216.767s">Number</a>  six, the project site must be swept daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3220.569s">It</a>  shall be kept free of debris for the duration of the installation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3225.492s">And</a>  those are the, basically that was approved and those were the conditions that were put forth by our city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3234.078s">So</a>  at this point, I would declare the public hearing open. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3237.74s">It</a>  opened to those in favor of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3240.422s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3240.622s">Cuddy,</a>  if you could just please give your name and address for the record again.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3243.904s">I</a>  believe you are in favor, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3246.158s">Yes,</a>  Diana Cuddy, 21 Judy's Lane, Mansfield, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3249.621s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3250.341s">Would</a>  anyone else at this point in time like to speak in favor of the project?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3259.148s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3259.548s">I</a>  don't see anyone that wants to speak in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3261.65s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3265.473s">So</a>  seeing and hearing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3269.456s">Anyone</a>  in opposition of the petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3271.717s">Is</a>  there anyone in opposition of the petition that would like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3284.773s">Okay,</a>  seeing and hearing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3291.195s">At</a>  this point in time, are there any questions from the council?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3294.817s">Motion</a>  for approval, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3296.617s">We</a>  have a motion of Council of Marks to approve, seconded by- Second. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3301.239s">Councilor</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3302.9s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3304.425s">Mr.</a>  President, through you, I was wondering if the petitioner could tell me on what side of the retaining wall on Broadway is this trench going to be dug? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3312.549s">Is</a>  it going to be on the northern side of the retaining wall or on the southern side? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3316.731s">If</a>  you're familiar with the area and you're driving up from Winter Hill and Somerville along Broadway, you'll come to the intersection of Medford Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3326.036s">There</a>  at that intersection, by way of history, is Paul Revere Park, which is the smallest park in the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3332.08s">But</a>  I digress, Mr. President, as you go past Paul Revere Park, Broadway splits in two, and you can go up Broadway and travel along the Medford border. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3341.005s">Some</a>  of that is Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3342.706s">Or</a>  you can stay on Broadway proper and go straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3346.687s">So</a>  I was wondering exactly where this trench was going to be dug, because there is a Broadway in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3352.029s">And</a>  it's the roadway that runs parallel to Broadway in Somerville, right where that split is, where it goes up and over the ridge and comes back down and brings you out where the old Salvation Army used to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3364.413s">right</a>  at Winter Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3365.313s">So</a>  I was wondering if the applicant could tell us where the trench is actually going to be dug. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3369.015s">Is</a>  it going to be dug on Broadway proper or is it going to be dug on that one-way access road?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3375.097s">So</a>  included in the application was a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3378.459s">The</a>  existing gas main will tie into the proposed gas main will tie into the existing one on Williams Street, which is closest to, I'm going to say, the northeast side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3390.478s">And</a>  then it will travel along Broadway on the northern side, on the Medford, closer to the Medford side.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3397.361s">So</a>  do we know which side of that retaining wall it's going to be on, I guess, is the question.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3403.924s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3404.665s">There's</a>  a retaining wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3405.745s">I</a>  don't see that on the plan.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3407.946s">Nor</a>  do I. So if you're looking at Medford Street at the intersection, you see that little park?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3415.57s">I</a>  do.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3416.39s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3416.67s">If</a>  you go past the little park, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3419.462s">There's</a>  a line with a little square. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3422.764s">And</a>  that line with a little square, I think that's a street that comes right through there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3429.168s">So</a>  I just don't know what side of the wall that proposed gas main is going to be on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3434.531s">Is</a>  it going to be on Broadway proper, or is it going to be on the access road?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3442.295s">It</a>  can go on either one, whatever.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3443.776s">I</a>  would much rather prefer it to be on Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3448.114s">I'm</a>  not in Medford, personally.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3451.335s">Because</a>  we try to avoid retaining walls, as you can imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3455.016s">Something</a>  like this, I didn't see the city engineer make a note of this in his condition, so I'm wondering if maybe this is something we could look into a little bit and have on the permit.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3471.44s">My</a>  colleagues are following me with what I'm talking about, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3473.4s">You</a>  guys know what I'm saying?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3474.34s">I</a>  think it's on the other side of the intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3476.141s">I</a>  might be wrong, too.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3483.527s">Dexter</a>  Street is Big Bundle.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3503.221s">We</a>  just need a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3504.502s">We're</a>  taking a look at the diagram.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3524.707s">I'm</a>  sorry, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3526.868s">That's</a>  Main Street, the little park, not Medford Street.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3532.211s">I</a>  don't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3532.872s">I'm</a>  looking on Google.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3534.032s">Main</a>  Street and Medford Street split. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3535.894s">Main</a>  Street goes further to the, I guess it would be east, and Medford Street goes up past those parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3543.418s">So</a>  I was confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3544.178s">I</a>  had, because Dexter Street threw me off, because Dexter's <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3547.639s">Dexter</a>  runs through Maine to Medford, so this is further down. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3552.103s">Creative</a>  Science is on the corner here of Dexter and- You are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3557.188s">So</a>  this will be going, there is no retaining wall, so this is all going in front of- Trump Field. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3561.992s">The</a>  pizza place, Dacos Tavern, the Chinese food restaurant coming around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3566.716s">Okay,</a>  yep, I second the motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3571.26s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3575.894s">Were</a>  there any other questions regarding this? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3580.516s">If</a>  I may, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3581.017s">Cuddy,</a>  the engineer mentions in his notes that, let's see, there are multiple broken concrete panels clustered at the vicinity of the point of entry for the gas service. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3595.524s">This</a>  cluster should be replaced as part of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3598.205s">Are</a>  those gonna be replaced with concrete? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3601.407s">Yes,</a>  they will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3602.667s">They</a>  will be, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3606.158s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3610.125s">This</a>  is a service call. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3611.628s">I</a>  know that there's some discussion in here about an SOP. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3614.413s">So</a>  SOP means that the applicant <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3618.973s">would</a>  provide the city with the funds to then go and perform, no, that's a street opening permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3624.797s">That's</a>  a different program. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3625.797s">I</a>  guess the question is, is the 60 feet of roadway that's being torn up in Medford going to be replaced curb to curb? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3632.161s">Where</a>  this is creation of new service, we're tearing up a couple of roadways 60 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3636.864s">Are</a>  we going to be able to get curb to curb restoration?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3641.48s">I</a>  think it's part of the engineers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3643.982s">Recommendations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3644.743s">His</a>  recommendation is for which</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3668.294s">the</a>  city engineer would make these conditions of the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3670.935s">So</a>  they're... Correct.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3672.476s">That's</a>  part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3673.136s">Point</a>  number 2, at a minimum, the street restoration plan must include curb-to-curb paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3678.818s">The</a>  SOP application must also include a traffic management plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3682.599s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3683.159s">It's</a>  at the top of page 27.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4631.106s">Mr.</a>  Franks.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4632.47s">That</a>  sounds about right, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4634.452s">2600</a>  feet or something like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4636.094s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4636.795s">And</a>  it goes right through our central business district, Mr. President, one that we've been talking about for as long as I can remember in terms of what we're going to do to revitalize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4647.225s">The</a>  lack of commitment to revitalize Medford Square coupled with <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4651.994s">the</a>  impacts of the Kranich Bridge closure for such an extended period of time, along with the COVID-19 situation that's happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4664.725s">We</a>  have a number of restaurants and places that provide food services along this stretch, and the impact that they've <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4675.561s">The</a>  financial impact that they've had to put up with through a variety of different reasons over the course of the last five years is troublesome, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4684.204s">So</a>  I guess this is a long way of asking a question, and the question is, how long will this construction take?</p>

    <p>[Franks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4698.199s">the</a>  construction crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4701.962s">But,</a>  you know, once we get in the, once we're able to get in the ground, we can move pretty quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4709.888s">It's,</a>  you know, a matter of days, not weeks.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4714.151s">Okay,</a>  so you think you guys can do 100 feet a day? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4718.294s">More</a>  than 100 feet a day?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4719.395s">Easily.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4720.255s">Easily.</a> </p>

    <p>[Franks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4731.862s">We</a>  shouldn't really need to store anything on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4740.768s">It</a>  might be helpful if you can unmute my colleague, Dave Zuwahling, who's <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4746.676s">at</a>  617-279-7864.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4794.217s">Was</a>  that a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4794.797s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4795.597s">Okay,</a>  excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4796.517s">So</a>  I'd like to offer that in the form of an amendment number 18, Mr. President, as a condition that there'll be no storage of any equipment or materials on the public way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4802.939s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4804.04s">With</a>  that being said, I rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4805.18s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4806.021s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4808.482s">We</a>  have Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4809.943s">You</a>  had a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4811.384s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4811.524s">OK,</a>  Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4812.264s">Am</a>  I good to go?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4820.768s">The</a>  city engineer I don't think is with us.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4823.35s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4826.311s">I</a>  guess then just to the petitioners, when will this construction start? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4832.335s">Is</a>  this next spring? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4833.336s">Is</a>  it this fall?</p>

    <p>[Franks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4835.898s">We</a>  would very much like to get this done before the moratorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4840.402s">Someone</a>  mentioned COVID earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4843.925s">We</a>  are getting a lot of calls from the residents and businesses there that they need a modern internet connection in today's world. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4852.512s">So</a>  we'd like to get it to them before the winter.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4855.529s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4855.949s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4856.35s">And</a>  I mean, my question for the engineer would be why, why are there 18 now conditions, but he's not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4862.134s">So</a>  that's okay.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4864.917s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4865.217s">Council</a>  appears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4870.361s">Cause</a>  there'll be, you're all set, right?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4871.502s">Perfect.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4872.943s">Vice-president</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4877.967s">We'll</a>  be having happening in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4879.328s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4888.382s">in</a>  the evening, I think was the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4891.144s">I</a>  believe that question would be up to the engineer when we apply for the street opening permit, what the limits of the working hours would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4899.609s">It</a>  would probably make a lot more sense to do the work at night and less impact to the businesses, and this is a heavily trafficked area. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4909.814s">We</a>  do have a traffic plan all prepared and ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4912.816s">depending</a>  upon if the petition and the project is approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4917.501s">That's</a>  certainly something we can entertain doing the work at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4921.326s">We'd</a>  probably be able to get more work done at night versus during the day, certainly.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4925.78s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, because like Mayor DeCosta said, this is an area already impacted by other circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4933.923s">And</a>  to take away their parking spots, and some of them have outdoor dining in that area, would be more cumbersome than they already have. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4942.445s">So</a>  if you could do this at night, after 10 o'clock, it would be greatly appreciated to all the businesses that are in that area.</p>

    <p>[Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4953.024s">We</a>  have done work at night on High Street in the past when we did 84 and 92 High Street, so we can certainly do the night work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4960.587s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4962.248s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4966.55s">Any</a>  other questions for the Council?</p>

Falco, Jr., President, Method City Council, Adam Herdeby, City Clerk, from Andre LaRue, Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5229.703s">It's</a>  dated September 18th, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5233.005s">regarding</a>  the proposed local historic district at the Haskell-Cutter House 16 Foster Court, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5239.729s">At</a>  its meeting on September 16, 2020, the Community Development Board voted to make no recommendation on the proposed local historic district at the Haskell-Cutter House 16 Foster Court, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5250.856s">but</a>  encourages the parties involved to pursue preservation of the historic structure either on this site or another site. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5258.501s">During</a>  the robust discussion, board members expressed their desire to work with the Historic District Commission to prioritize conservation properties for future districts, find additional ways of celebrating Medford shipbuilding history, and support a citywide evaluation of the city's historic assets. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5276.792s">Thank</a>  you for the opportunity to review this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5279.233s">Andrew</a>  LaRue, Chairman, and the CC was to Breanna Lungo-Koehn mayor, and Kimberly Scanley, the acting city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5287.437s">Council</a>  appears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5290.278s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5292.919s">I</a>  didn't have my hand up yet, but I was going to put it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5298.462s">We've</a>  had a lot of discussion about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5300.263s">We</a>  went on a site visit yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5301.804s">I</a>  think the discussion in our committee of the whole Allen site showed us that we are really close here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5308.047s">I</a>  think that the property owner <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5311.946s">and</a>  the members of the historic commission, the historic district commission are close, and I think we should encourage that compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5318.409s">But</a>  I also think that what's before us tonight is the question of whether 16 Foster Court and the 200-year-old structure on the lot warrants a historic district designation, and I think from the evidence we've been shown, it absolutely does. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5330.654s">I'm</a>  heartened by the efforts of the property owner to reach compromise, and now, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5337.697s">I'm</a>  concerned that if we don't approve the district that the compromise won't be reached and one of the last pieces of the shipbuilding history of our city, which as we know is an important part of our city's history, will be demolished on October 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5352.509s">Now</a>  that the community process is underway, and now that it's clear that the developer and the Historical Commission and the Historic District Commission are near to a good faith compromise, I think we should approve the district, ensuring that the community process can continue without the threat of demolition hanging over the discussions and the goal of compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5369.551s">I</a>  think 16 Foster Court clearly deserves the historic designation, regardless of the compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5375.335s">I'm</a>  hopeful that it will keep the facade of the building and that we can really celebrate the shipbuilding history of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5384.222s">But</a>  that designation certainly would not preclude moving forward with development, and I think all parties involved are ready to have that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5391.167s">So</a>  I think we should advance this, but I welcome hearing from my other Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5397.292s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5398.66s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5399.04s">Thank</a>  you console beers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5400.201s">So</a>  when you were saying are you advancing it?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5404.104s">Okay,</a>  so make sure Let's see there is there any any other consoles that like to speak on this matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5414.531s">Well,</a>  I'm just constantly I Didn't see a button press. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5418.854s">Let</a>  me just uh, oh, you know, it's the screens different. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5422.057s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5422.437s">I</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5423.575s">Councilor</a>  Knight, and then Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5425.417s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5426.459s">Mr.</a>  President, I personally couldn't agree with Councilor Bears more. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5428.842s">I'm</a>  very glad to see the property owner and the historic commission sitting down trying to make compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5434.449s">We</a>  have ample opportunity and time to still address this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5439.416s">We</a>  have another meeting before the deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5442.598s">I'd</a>  ask that the matter be tabled to a date certain to allow the homeowner and the historical commission to continue their deliberations and discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5449.343s">But</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, we do have, I believe, representatives here from the owner that have been working on a plan or are ready to make some commitments to a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5459.59s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that the property owner be given an opportunity to speak.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5468.888s">Ari</a>  Goldschneider, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Goldschneider]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5494.296s">I</a>  want to express my appreciation to the City Council and the various other people that attended the Committee of the Whole yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5504.718s">I</a>  think we're close on a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5507.619s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Marks for brokering or helping broker a potential negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5520.305s">between</a>  the two parties here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5523.726s">Adam's</a>  gonna speak a bit more to what we are proposing, but just in short, we plan on incorporating, you know what, I'm gonna let Adam talk to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5540.192s">He's</a>  gonna be able to talk to it much more eloquently than I am, so Adam, why don't you go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Glassman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5545.393s">Okay,</a>  we've got, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5554.943s">I</a>  think everyone realizes during construction that these elements will not preserved in their current state. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5562.147s">But</a>  we can <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5577.216s">that</a>  we're going to be presenting a rendering next hearing on Oct 6th.</p>

    <p>[Platt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5595.094s">Mr.</a>  President and members of the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5597.076s">Thank</a>  you so much for letting us come back and we really appreciate you coming out to the site and taking a look at the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5604.221s">I</a>  think you get a much better sense of what we have there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5609.304s">And</a>  while <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5610.985s">the</a>  existing building is not practical for reuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5614.989s">And</a>  we had talked about being able to, whether or not you could just save the facade itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5621.234s">And</a>  from what our engineer and the building inspector confirmed, you can't remove the facade without the whole building collapsing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5629.921s">What</a>  we have been able to do with the input from the city council and from the historical commission is <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5637.127s">to</a>  incorporate certain aspects, architectural conditions from the front of the building, which will be now incorporated into the plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5647.192s">We</a>  just had the on-site meeting yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5649.493s">As</a>  you know, our architect, Adam Muir, is working on the plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5653.275s">We</a>  don't have them for you yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5655.676s">But</a>  we are eager to work with you and with the commission to try to incorporate some of those concepts into the new plan so we can continue to have some of that <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5670.245s">the</a>  reference back to the past into the new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5673.306s">We</a>  would hope to have these to you, and Adam, correct me if I'm wrong, sometime before the meeting on October 6th, so you can have those, and then we can talk with both the Historical Commission and you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5689.872s">The</a>  idea would be <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5692.414s">being</a>  able to reach some sort of agreement on these plans and have our good faith to work on those going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5701.181s">And</a>  then the request would be, of course, to have the second amendment to the revised ordinances to adopt the single lot historic district, to have that withdrawn once we come forward with revised plans.</p>

    <p>[Goldschneider]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5718.004s">I'm</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5718.404s">architectural</a>  elements are</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5748.015s">Council,</a>  actually, do you want to speak out tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5752.54s">We</a>  have a couple of councils with the hits.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5754.423s">I</a>  got a question if you're ready to give it to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5756.084s">I</a>  have no problem.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5758.507s">Council</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Goldschneider]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5787.957s">Absolutely,</a>  Councilor.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5826.118s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5827.779s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5834.003s">Okay,</a>  Councilor Marks and then Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5836.324s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5837.805s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5839.366s">I</a>  just want to thank members of the historic commission that were present there last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5845.49s">I</a>  want to thank the property owner and, Mr. President, I do want to thank this Medford City Council that took the time, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5856.095s">when</a>  it didn't look that anything was going to result in this property. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5861.7s">And</a>  I think we're that much closer to coming to a win-win situation on both sides, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5868.886s">And</a>  I want to thank the members of this council that stood up to say, you know what, we'd like to go on a site visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5874.971s">We'd</a>  like to hear from the property owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5877.981s">We'd</a>  like to come to a resolve, because we all support the same issues behind this rail, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5884.704s">Don't</a>  let anyone kid you otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5887.064s">We</a>  all support it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5889.285s">And</a>  it was because of the due diligence of this council standing up and saying that we believe we can make a difference, that I hope this comes to fruition, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5900.469s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5904.79s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5906.311s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5907.031s">I</a>  want to reiterate Councilor Marks' comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5911.293s">I</a>  mean, after all this time waiting, and then all of a sudden on the last hour, we were able to convene and sit with the owners and the commission, everybody, and hopefully <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5925.958s">I</a>  think we agreed last night that they would provide a rendering to make the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5932.262s">Because</a>  again, we only met last night, and I think it would have been hard for them to be able to accomplish something in one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5938.246s">And</a>  I think we all agreed to wait until next week before we made a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5944.71s">But</a>  Councilor Baxter's right, we all worked hard here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5947.212s">We</a>  came together as a group and as all the commissions to hopefully come off <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5954.116s">to</a>  come up with something gamical to make all parties happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5957.417s">So</a>  I want to thank everybody involved for all their work.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5961.559s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5964.761s">Let's</a>  see, we have Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5967.302s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5968.082s">Again,</a>  just to reiterate, I think that for what the Historical Commission has in front of them, it's a daunting task when you look at our community and its historical values. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5977.966s">And</a>  we all, like Councilman Mark said, I think all of us <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5982.749s">And</a>  I think that the situation that we were put in with this situation had a lot to do with maybe the COVID and the opportunity for both parties to meet in a mutual and respectful manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5996.378s">I</a>  think both the commission and the homeowner were great. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5999.56s">We</a>  appreciate the opportunity to walk through the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6003.823s">That</a>  piece was glaring, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6005.905s">What's</a>  important to me is to sit in front of a home, not behind these chambers, but with the people involved, all in front of each other, face to face. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6014.132s">And</a>  it was something as simple as Council Marks' experience by working on this council for many, many years to just bring up a topic that maybe both parties can speak on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6029.508s">And</a>  this is what we're seeing, we're seeing the best of the worst case scenario avoided. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6035.791s">So</a>  again, I applaud my colleagues and both the historical commission and the homeowner to reach an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6044.495s">Because</a>  we've seen our share of greeted developers in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6050.117s">And</a>  I think this homeowner was very open and honest with us and <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6059.961s">And</a>  we'll work now with our commission to make sure that we are going to keep as much as the historical preservation that we can on that site. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6071.568s">So</a>  again, I thank my colleagues and I believe that's a good example of good government. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6076.691s">So</a>  again, thank you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6078.793s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6080.534s">And</a>  I want to, Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6084.653s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and I want to echo Councilor Marks and my colleagues' comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6089.214s">And</a>  I also want to say that I think this shows the efficacy of the demo delay and the potential historic district as a tool to ensure that we can have a negotiation and reach a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6098.897s">I</a>  think in many cases in this community with developers, we don't really have much community leverage, and in this case we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6106.819s">And</a>  I think it's allowed us to meet all of the different pieces of this, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6111.963s">It's</a>  allowed us to really make sure that development can happen, that housing units can be built, which I think we all agree that, you know, in an apartment district, it makes sense to have, on a lot of that size, it makes sense to have units, while also maintaining historical preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6125.833s">So</a>  I just want to say I think it actually shows that, you know, if we didn't have demo delay and we didn't have this historic district proposal, we would just, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6134.759s">have</a>  another building of apartments and not something that preserves and kind of highlights the history of shipbuilding in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6141.964s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6143.645s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6144.725s">And</a>  if I may, I want to thank everyone that was involved in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6148.508s">I</a>  know, you know, I think it was beneficial to go out to the site to actually have a walk through the property and both inside and outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6158.354s">That's</a>  always beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6160.135s">And</a>  I'd like to thank everyone for their involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6163.956s">But</a>  we do have a little bit of an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6166.917s">I</a>  did talk to the city solicitor today, and that window is getting smaller and smaller as to what we need to do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6175.379s">With</a>  regard to the vote that we're supposed to take tonight, it's supposed to be should this be a historical district, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6183.822s">And</a>  so tonight would technically be the first reading of this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6188.143s">So-</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6190.453s">I'm</a>  sorry, provided it passes.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6192.694s">You</a>  are correct.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6195.435s">But</a>  if, okay.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6203.098s">So</a>  if I want to make sure we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6206.36s">So,</a>  so, and I thank you for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6208.801s">So</a>  if it passes, it would be its first reading and then it would go to the paper for its, so actually yeah, then it would go to the paper for its second reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6217.524s">So</a>  therefore if we didn't vote tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6221.479s">What's</a>  going to happen is, the next meeting is October 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6226.14s">And</a>  therefore, the second reading wouldn't get into the paper after the demo delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6232.321s">Point</a>  of information, demo delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6234.262s">So</a>  from what I've been told, we need to make a vote tonight on whether this is actually going to be historic district or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6243.104s">And</a>  then when it comes back to the third reading, if something changes, then we can go from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6247.664s">But</a>  I think that- We don't receive this information.</p>

    <p>[Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6250.566s">And</a>  told by whom?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6251.487s">I</a>  just called today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6252.629s">I</a>  made this call at 5 o'clock this afternoon, literally right before I came to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6261.722s">Because</a>  I like to get all, I like to make sure that, you know what, when this happens, I, you know.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6268.208s">Is</a>  the city solicitor available as requested by the president from the meeting yesterday?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6272.05s">I</a>  asked the city solicitor if she was available tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6274.951s">She</a>  said no. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6276.012s">She</a>  was busy, but we can try giving her a call if you like, if you want to take a brief recess.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6282.394s">I'm</a>  just looking at the committee report from last night where President Falco said that the council needs the city solicitor present. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6288.797s">And</a>  then the next sentence says Mr. Howard suggested holding off on a historic district. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6292.987s">So</a>  that's what I'm referring to is the conversation we had last night.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6295.969s">And</a>  I asked the city solicitor today if she could be present tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6299.071s">She</a>  said she could not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6300.492s">But</a>  we can try giving her a call if you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6302.133s">We</a>  can take a brief recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6303.553s">I</a>  can try getting her on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6305.675s">Is</a>  that what the council would like to do?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6309.597s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6310.518s">But</a>  with all due respect, Mr. President, I had a conversation with the solicitor as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6314.64s">And</a>  from what the solicitor told me in my conversation with her was that <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6319.673s">The</a>  issuance of the demolition permit is told when the paper is advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6328.256s">So</a>  it doesn't matter if 18 months pass after the paper is advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6332.898s">And</a>  there's case law on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6334.578s">And</a>  she and I spoke about it at length today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6337.099s">I</a>  did too. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6338.52s">So</a>  I'm not sure if the information that you're getting from her and the information that I'm getting from her are the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6344.122s">But</a>  I'm pretty confident in the conversation that I had with her where she said, you're absolutely right, Adam. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6348.423s">I</a>  don't know why this is so hard to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6351.348s">First</a>  reading happens, then it gets advertised, and then advertisement controls. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6355.175s">If</a>  advertisement goes out, the demolition permit can't get issued, regardless of whether or not October 8th comes and goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6362.603s">So</a>  second reading is the advertisement. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6366.705s">And</a>  that is what tolls the demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6369.307s">And</a>  we can toll the demolition delay on October 7th if need be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6372.728s">So</a>  I don't understand the need to take this to a vote right now when you yourself had suggested that the city solicitor needs to be present in order for us to make this vote properly, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6381.373s">And</a>  number two, when the representative of the historic commission who was with us at the meeting suggested we hold off on it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6387.576s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6388.885s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6390.746s">Would</a>  the second reading be able to be published on October 7th? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6395.128s">What</a>  is the print deadline for the Medford transcript? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6398.41s">Why</a>  does it have to be in the transcript? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6399.831s">The</a>  Globe runs every day.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6400.811s">The</a>  Herald runs every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6402.192s">The</a>  Globe costs $1,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6403.973s">Pay</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6405.174s">The</a>  House is so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6406.074s">Why</a>  don't we want to spend the money to advertise for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6408.595s">I</a>  mean, more people read the Globe than the transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6410.276s">I</a>  can't tell you a person that ever bought the Medford transcript in the last 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6413.018s">I</a>  don't know one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6414.118s">I</a>  buy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6414.639s">I</a>  get it every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6416.159s">God</a>  bless you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6416.74s">I</a>  know two.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6417.906s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6429.652s">Your</a>  suggested kind of solution was we could do first reading, second reading, and then if something changes by third, we still have that option to- It's still a third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6438.439s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6438.879s">We</a>  still have the option to change should the compromise be met and things are satisfied.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6442.782s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6443.123s">I</a>  mean, if you go to the point of the compromise, I mean, have any plans been brought to the building commissioner? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6449.327s">Has</a>  the building commissioner seen anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6450.708s">I</a>  would assume he would have to see that as well.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6452.129s">Between</a>  7 o'clock last night and this morning?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6453.71s">I</a>  mean- <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6454.551s">I</a>  understand that, but you know what, the way I look at it too, it's not our fault we're in this jam right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6458.352s">I</a>  mean, here we are down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6460.332s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6460.912s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6465.173s">One</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6467.434s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6469.534s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6470.555s">And</a>  I appreciate both sides on this, believe me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6473.335s">But</a>  after last night's meeting, I think we'd be doing this whole process an injustice to keep on moving the goal pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6482.557s">If</a>  we keep on moving it, we got a commitment last night to move forward based on what was stated last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6489.949s">And</a>  that was clear to me, what was stated last night, that we were going to work to maintain the front facade. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6497.037s">And</a>  we were not going to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6498.858s">This</a>  is right out of Ryan Hayward's mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6501.379s">And</a>  I think I asked him the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6503.14s">And</a>  he said, absolutely, we would wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6505.14s">He</a>  said, we may do it at a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6506.821s">I</a>  remember him saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6508.682s">We</a>  may do it down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6510.563s">I</a>  can't promise you we won't revisit it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6512.683s">But</a>  at this point, if we're able to move this forward, like we did last night, that we weren't going to move that issue forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6519.526s">So</a>  now we're hearing that you want to move it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6521.627s">Because</a>  even though it's the first reading, it's still moving the issue forward, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6526.529s">However</a>  you slice that pie, it's still moving it forward, and that flies in the face of what we agreed upon in good faith last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6534.332s">So</a>  I don't think we can keep on moving the goal post here and think we're going to come out with a resolve if we're going to change the game as this goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6542.874s">That's</a>  all I say, and I don't think that represents either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6546.615s">I</a>  think that's just common sense in negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6550.177s">If</a>  you don't stick by a negotiation, it's not going to end up working.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6555.118s">And</a>  I appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6556.079s">I'm</a>  not saying it has anything to do with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6558.96s">But</a>  what I'm saying is I don't think we should change it at this particular point.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6563.182s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6564.962s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6565.903s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6567.203s">I</a>  just got a message from Ryan Hayward that they have approved the cost to run it in the Herald or Globe if needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6572.526s">So</a>  I'm comfortable tabling until the 6th.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6576.648s">I'm</a>  glad Ryan gave you approval.</p>

    <p>[Goldschneider]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6580.889s">President,</a>  can I speak, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6582.91s">Yes,</a>  Mr. Goldschneider, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6585.326s">I</a>  think we had a very productive discussion last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6589.53s">A</a>  lot of issues were flushed out in person and we came to, I'll just call it like a business arrangement with the local historic commission, local historic district commission, an arrangement, an agreement in principle that in return for <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6615.82s">to</a>  incorporate certain items, architectural items from the existing home into the new design. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6624.906s">And</a>  now what Councilor Beals brought up with regard to the historical market, including those two items, it was my understanding based on the dialogue last night, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6637.475s">that</a>  moving forward with the historic district would not continue pending the review of the plans on October 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6648.242s">So</a>  this has sort of surprised me, because I thought that we had agreed to something in principle and now things are sort of changing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6657.168s">I</a>  wasn't prepared.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6658.809s">The</a>  only thing I was doing was giving the council information that I got. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6664.613s">That's</a>  all I was doing, okay?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6669.637s">I</a>  second Councilor Knight's motion to table.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6672.019s">So</a>  there is a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6674.0s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6675.261s">Mr.</a>  President, before we table the matter, there is a committee of the whole report that's before us that's going to have to get put into the agenda for next week's meeting for us to vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6684.628s">But</a>  last night at the site visit, we did vote on a motion to ask a question of the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6692.316s">And</a>  that question that we asked to the city solicitor was, can this process constitute a regulatory taking, opening up the city to financial or other liabilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6701.062s">And</a>  I'd like to offer that question to the city solicitor as a B paper this evening, so that we can get that to her for an answer as well before next week.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6708.548s">Okay,</a>  so we'll take the B paper first. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6710.889s">Clerk</a>  Hurtubise, do you have the wording in the B paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6713.131s">Clerk</a>  Hurtubise, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6722.715s">I</a>  have the first part. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6724.576s">Can</a>  this process be considered regulatory taking?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6728.158s">Opening</a>  the city up to financial or other liabilities.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6734.081s">Financial</a>  or other liabilities.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6740.685s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6742.606s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6742.926s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6746.508s">On</a>  that motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6751.923s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello, Clerk Hunter, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6754.224s">This</a>  is on the B paper.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7019.465s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7020.766s">I'm</a>  incredibly glad to see this item before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7023.287s">I</a>  think charter reviews are long overdue in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7025.829s">I</a>  think this charter was last reviewed before I was born. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7028.271s">And</a>  empowering this council and ensuring greater representation and diversity on the council are one of the many ways I hope, one of the many changes I hope the Charter Commission would explore. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7038.717s">I</a>  do have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7040.439s">I'm</a>  not sure if a representative of the city administration will be able to answer it or who we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7046.242s">We</a>  have Jackie Peeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7047.863s">I'm</a>  not sure if Jackie has this information off the top of her head. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7051.004s">And</a>  maybe my colleagues, I'm especially thinking Councilor Knight might have the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7056.606s">If</a>  this were approved tonight, would it be disposed of by the legislature at the end of this session in December? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7063.009s">And</a>  would a new home rule petition have to be sent after the new general court session begins in January?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7068.751s">Okay,</a>  thank you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7070.932s">We</a>  have Jackie Peeks, who is representing the administration tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7073.973s">Jackie.</a> </p>

    <p>[Peeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7076.821s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor, for that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7078.543s">I</a>  do not know off the top of my head, but I will certainly find out and report back to the council.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7085.188s">I</a>  think Councilor Knight might have said yes.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7087.71s">Mr.</a>  President, if the legislation doesn't pass by the close of the end of the legislative session, then the bill needs to be reintroduced for the next legislative session. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7095.636s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7096.757s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7097.377s">The</a>  question would come as to whether or not we need to pass another home rule petition to reintroduce the bill in the next legislative session. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7102.902s">And</a>  that I can't answer.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7104.923s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7110.036s">Thank</a>  you, Jackie. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7112.196s">Councilor</a>  Knight, I'm sorry, did you have a question?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7116.317s">Is</a>  that a question you'd like to ask the solicitor?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7123.119s">Yeah,</a>  I would be happy to ask the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7125.6s">I'll</a>  ask on my own, thank you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7129.721s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7131.662s">Any</a>  other questions from the council on this?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7137.912s">Councilor</a>  Layton.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7138.832s">I,</a>  for one, will not be supporting this paper this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7141.333s">We're</a>  in the middle of a global pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7143.153s">We</a>  had a meeting for two hours today talking about how we're unable to conduct regular city council business right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7149.635s">One</a>  out of five adults in Massachusetts are unemployed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7152.196s">We</a>  have a 20% unemployment rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7153.816s">We're</a>  seeing the worst economic time since the Great Depression. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7158.137s">People</a>  are restricted in their ability to get about the community, to speak with people, to talk to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7162.098s">It's</a>  going to impact the ability to run a grassroots campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7164.819s">and</a>  inform the residents in this community what's going on, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7168.281s">Number</a>  two, in times of uncertainty, we need stability. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7172.663s">In</a>  times of uncertainty, we need stability. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7174.524s">We</a>  should be focusing on getting our kids back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7176.425s">We</a>  should be focusing on getting our economy locally back up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7179.346s">I</a>  think that's what our priority should be right now during this global pandemic, things that actually make the community and the city run, the services that we deliver. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7186.73s">You</a>  know, I've stated and I've been opposed to this process in the past, doing it with the homework petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7190.792s">I</a>  feel as though this is something that should come from the voters, that should come from the ground up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7194.113s">And</a>  now is not the time to promote a ground up effort when the activities of people are so hamstrung. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7200.559s">And</a>  where our government is operating under such stringent restrictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7204.783s">So</a>  for those reasons, I'll be voting against the paper this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7207.405s">I</a>  rest my case.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7208.466s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7211.489s">Any</a>  other councilors want to speak on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7213.771s">Yes,</a>  so we have a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7215.232s">Okay,</a>  let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7217.174s">We'll</a>  go with Councilor Marks and then Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7219.776s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7221.736s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my colleague, Councilor Knight, for his comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7228.121s">This</a>  indeed is a very difficult time to move forward on such a large endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7235.307s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7237.077s">It</a>  was back in February of 2016 when I offered the original home rule petition, which I believe some members of the council were on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7247.405s">It</a>  reads a little different from what the mayor is offering. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7251.108s">At</a>  the time, we were looking at a seven member commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7257.013s">We</a>  also outlined when a final report would be back with recommendations, which at the time we thought was <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7265.72s">key</a>  component to moving this along, because if you leave it open ended, the process inherently is a long process to start off with. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7275.924s">When</a>  we reviewed this back in 2016, February 2016, we were looking at potential ballot questions in 2019 or 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7289.636s">So</a>  that shows you it's at least a two to three year process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7295.581s">Built</a>  into that number is at the time what we established was an 18 month review process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7304.409s">So</a>  once you establish a commission, then they had roughly 18 months to go through a charter that hasn't been reviewed in 34 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7315.413s">A</a>  charter that's only been changed over the last 34 years, ironically, to give increases to the mayor's salary, which is under the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7327.083s">And</a>  that's the only really review that's been looked at when it comes to charter review in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7334.37s">The</a>  charter is the constitution that governs our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7338.734s">It's</a>  a vital document that I'd say most people in the community are unaware of because, let's be quite frank, we haven't reviewed it in 34 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7347.864s">There</a>  hasn't been much discussion and people are just not aware of what the charter defines. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7354.791s">And</a>  there's a number of issues within the charter or responsibilities and powers that define how government operates, the length of terms, the duties and powers and responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7369.918s">And</a>  it is extremely vital, even during a pandemic, that we focus on a charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7378.923s">And</a>  I, as one member of the council, think there's no better time than the present <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7384.369s">to</a>  start the ball rolling and take a look at what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7390.892s">And</a>  this is not putting a stamp of approval saying that things will be changed in the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7397.055s">We're</a>  asking for a charter commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7399.857s">The</a>  commission may sit down and look at the charter and say, wow, you guys created a perfect charter 34 years ago, and we don't think anything needs to be done to this charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7410.182s">I</a>  don't think that's going to be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7412.756s">But</a>  that could happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7414.717s">So</a>  this is not saying the charter's going to be changed in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7418.278s">It's</a>  just saying, let's create a review process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7421.879s">Many</a>  charters that, if you look at cities and towns, they have a built-in periodic review of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7430.743s">When</a>  ours was created some 34 years ago, there was no built-in review. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7436.045s">Hence</a>  why we're at a point now that the charter's never been reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7441.963s">So</a>  when I offered the resolution back in 2016, the home rule petition, one of the recommendations that was part of that petition was that at a minimum, an amendment be present in the city charter instituting an appointed committee to conduct a periodic review of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7464.335s">So</a>  at a minimum, whatever happened, if there were no change at all, then at least we know going forward, and I agree with this 1,000%, I don't know where my colleagues stand, that this charter should be reviewed every so often. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7476.863s">Whether</a>  it's yearly, whether it's every few years, whatever it might be, it needs to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7482.586s">If</a>  you had a business plan from 35 years ago, you would be out of business right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7487.651s">And</a>  the charter is no different, it's a business plan how we operate a community and how we run a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7494.953s">And</a>  so I think it's very important that we move forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7499.654s">If</a>  it does calling for a refiling next year, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7504.875s">So</a>  be it, we refile it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7507.036s">When</a>  we filed this back in 2016, it was a four to three vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7513.408s">It</a>  passed four to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7516.309s">We</a>  sent it to the state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7518.729s">Many</a>  of us that were supportive of this back in 2016 followed through the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7525.451s">Unfortunately,</a>  the process did not exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7528.872s">The</a>  chairman of the committee, and his name escapes me right now, decided on his own, Mr. President, because I talked to him back in 2016, decided on his own not to give this a hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7544.332s">And</a>  I asked, why would you not give a petition that's before you, a home rule petition that's crafted by a city saying the city wants it, the representatives, the forefathers of the city said, we want this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7557.372s">And</a>  his answer to me, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7560.819s">was</a>  that I don't believe that the four to three vote was a majority of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7567.968s">It</a>  didn't represent a majority of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7571.833s">And</a>  I question saying a four to three vote is a majority of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7576.559s">And</a>  it's no difference when you vote as a state legislator that a majority wins, a majority rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7583.281s">And</a>  at the time, he just disagreed and didn't give it the proper hearing that it should have received, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7589.804s">So</a>  I'm hoping this time, and I know there's some members that are hesitant with this, Mr. President, but I would respectfully ask my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7598.547s">that</a>  allow this to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7601.591s">This</a>  is the first step in many steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7605.156s">This</a>  is a two to three year process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7608.38s">This</a>  is not going to happen overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7610.382s">And</a>  I'm hoping as we move forward, Mr. President, that the pandemic will be behind us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7615.984s">That's</a>  how long this process is going to take, and I'm hoping that's behind us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7620.308s">So</a>  regarding the signatures that are required, I believe it's 15% of the number of registered voters that you have in the community to put it on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7636.069s">We've</a>  had people of the community for the last several years, some good people that have walked around, knocked doors, stood in front of stores, got thousands of signatures, still fell short of the mark of the 15% that's required, Mr. President, but did yeoman's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7654.673s">And</a>  I believe there's enough support out there in the community to move this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7659.194s">Why</a>  not assist, if we can, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7661.895s">As</a>  legislators for this city, why not assist in moving the process forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7670.503s">Not</a>  disregarding a process, the signatures is one process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7674.086s">A</a>  home rule petition is another process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7677.469s">There's</a>  more ways than one to skin a cat. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7680.532s">We're</a>  skinning a cat a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7682.734s">We're</a>  going to the legislative home rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7686.721s">It's</a>  long overdue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7688.823s">I</a>  appreciate there's a lot of opinions on this, and it hasn't been looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7692.966s">And</a>  some people may see this as a struggle for power, some people may see it all different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7700.292s">I</a>  see it, Mr. President, as good government in reviewing a document that really requires review in this day and age. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7708.258s">The</a>  city has changed in the last 35 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7712.526s">And</a>  we should change with the times as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7715.189s">So</a>  I respectfully ask my colleagues to take a long look at this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7720.334s">I</a>  will be supporting this tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7723.217s">Like</a>  I said, to move the first step forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7725.74s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7728.578s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7730.059s">Echoing</a>  a lot of what's been said already, this is something that is long overdue, and I thank the administration for introducing this, highlighting the fact that, as Councilor Mark said, this is, it's a review, it's just that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7741.804s">It's</a>  a long process that I think we absolutely need to start as soon as possible, and every election since I've lived in Medford, this has been an issue, and I think we owe it to the citizens of this city to move forward in good faith to do <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7754.17s">just</a>  what this is, which is review to look at what we're operating on, and I support this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7759.792s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7760.252s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7761.252s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7762.073s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7764.473s">Like</a>  Councilor Mock said, I too supported this in 2016, but I will tell you, I think that because the process does take the time that it will take, unfortunately, this isn't something that this council created or this council <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7781.059s">This</a>  council delayed, I think I was one of the four councils voted for that in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7785.182s">But</a>  I think Councilor Knight brings up a very important point that we started our subcommittee meeting with. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7791.346s">There's</a>  so much going on right now in our community that we, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7796.91s">The</a>  focus has to be on the bigger things in our community right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7800.814s">This</a>  is something that needs to be done down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7803.376s">I</a>  think that hopefully as you see things turn and people are back in this chamber and we get to move things forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7810.523s">Kids</a>  are back in school and city business is done a little bit differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7815.067s">I</a>  think that I'll go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7817.089s">But</a>  as of tonight, I think there are too many variables and too many issues that our city is dealing with right now to even spend a minute focused on charter review, considering that, like I said, it is a two to three year process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7830.92s">And</a>  right now, I think we need to focus on <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7835.805s">issues</a>  that are in front of us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7837.266s">So,</a>  again, I thank both Councilor Marks and Councilor Knights viewpoints on both, but I will not be supporting this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7846.713s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7847.153s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7848.414s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7849.835s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7850.556s">Mr.</a>  President, I was part of the council when this came up the last time, and I did not support it back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7859.563s">Councilor</a>  Marks made some <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7861.604s">Very</a>  good points there, and I do agree with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7864.205s">But</a>  I also agree with Councilor Knight that right now is really not the time for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7869.027s">We've</a>  got many other things happening in the city that are much more important than this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7875.535s">And</a>  I think once the kids are back in school and we're back and doing regular business here, this would be something I could support. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7883.821s">But</a>  at this particular time, I can't support it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7888.184s">Just</a>  because, as I said, we've got way too many things happening in this city and other business needs to be done at this particular time, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7896.83s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7898.231s">Mr.</a>  President, motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7901.734s">Council</a>  members?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7904.201s">Motion</a>  to approve.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7905.042s">Okay,</a>  on the motion of Councilor Bears, seconded by- Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7909.566s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7911.488s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7915.551s">Yes,</a>  let me do that, one minute.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7919.435s">Councilor</a>  Marks, there you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7921.937s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and I don't like to dwell on the past, but knowing what happened in 2016, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7929.195s">And</a>  I'm not sure if that representative is still even the chairman of that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7932.899s">I</a>  don't know if it was the committee on local affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7936.183s">I</a>  can't even remember the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7939.727s">Maybe</a>  election laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7941.349s">John</a>  Rogers, is that something? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7942.97s">Maybe</a>  it was Representative Rogers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7946.674s">I</a>  can't recall, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7948.476s">I</a>  got a lot of. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7950.126s">Useful</a>  information stuck in my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7953.928s">Useless</a>  information stuck in my head, but that's not one of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7956.89s">But</a>  I would just ask, Mr. President, respectfully that I would hate to pass something that is going to be on the same wave as we did in 2016 and then only go up to the State House and them say that it doesn't have the support of the city because of the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7978.204s">or</a>  the sheer number of votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7981.127s">So</a>  I can see what my colleagues are stating, that this may not be the best time, but if we looked at maybe the beginning of the next fiscal year, January, does that sound like a time that <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7998.373s">would</a>  be amendable to other members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8000.634s">I</a>  don't know if it's strictly just the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8002.555s">They</a>  may have other philosophical differences with charter review and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8007.418s">But</a>  if that's the case, I wouldn't mind holding off until January, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8013.701s">Especially</a>  if this did happen to go down tonight, we couldn't bring it up again for what, 90 days? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8020.098s">So</a>  you're looking at that time frame anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8023.86s">I'm</a>  prepared to vote on it tonight, but I just would hate to see this go down the same way, because I really believe in it strongly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8031.905s">So</a>  I just want to throw that out to my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8034.367s">If</a>  there is support, maybe not this particular second, but maybe in January, is that workable? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8042.772s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8043.632s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8046.328s">I</a>  think that there's areas to agree and disagree, but this is something we agree on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8051.71s">Unfortunately,</a>  what we don't agree on is a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8054.371s">I</a>  think that as one council who voted for this in the past, and knowing that it's something that needs to be done, like our zoning and many other things, historical issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8065.675s">So</a>  I think that this is important, but I think right now, I think there's so much that supersedes it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8070.497s">That</a>  if it is offered sometime in the next fiscal year, it'll be something that I will totally <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8075.899s">support</a>  again, so I thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8079.242s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8082.205s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8083.686s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8085.027s">And</a>  I hear what people are saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8086.189s">I</a>  just think this is the part where it's not, we're not, the city of Benford is not focused on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8090.573s">This</a>  is, we're asking the permission from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8092.755s">We've</a>  known how long it can take on a variety of home rule petitions that this council has sent in the past that have never been heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8098.8s">I</a>  think we are advantaged by sending it sooner rather than later, trying to get the legislature to move on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8105.705s">Because</a>  I think if we send it, I'll vote for it now, I'll vote for it in January, I'll vote for it whenever it's on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8112.15s">But</a>  if we send it in January, it could be the next January before they act on it, or they may never act on it at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8118.575s">So</a>  I just think if we're talking about time, this is the part of the process where it's not, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8125.649s">in</a>  the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8126.77s">It's</a>  in the general court asking for the home rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8131.412s">So</a>  I just think getting it up there sooner rather than later to try to move it along, it doesn't mean that this council can't focus on the many other issues that we have at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8141.436s">So</a>  that's just where I'm at. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8143.838s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8145.238s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8146.259s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8148.165s">I</a>  do think it's also important to point out, for those that are so supportive of the measure, that if it goes forward tonight, you get two bites at the apple. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8156.531s">because</a>  if it doesn't pass by January, then it gets refiled again. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8159.654s">And</a>  if it does get passed before January, then you get charter commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8163.516s">But</a>  I don't support the paper, but from an operational standpoint, if it got held until the end of the year or <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8171.983s">or</a>  tabled or whatever it may be, and it can't come back up for 90 days, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8176.047s">The</a>  next session's in session. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8177.349s">So</a>  you can send the paper to legislation now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8179.411s">If</a>  it doesn't get taken up for a vote, it doesn't get taken up for a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8181.713s">Then</a>  you want to do it again in January anyway when the circumstances change, you get another bite at the apple with a new legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8187.599s">So</a>  that's something to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8188.76s">But</a>  either way, I'm not going to support it this evening.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8190.983s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8191.183s">Well,</a>  Mr. President, if I may.</p>
