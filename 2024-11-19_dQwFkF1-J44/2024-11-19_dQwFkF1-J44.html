    <p>[Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=330.331s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=331.671s">As</a>  you know, Post 45 is <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=336.087s">has</a>  been there since 1919, and it's a community-based veterans organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=342.988s">And</a>  what we want to do now, in keeping with the times, is be able to serve a minimal amount of food to our members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=358.951s">And</a>  we've worked very hard to bring the place up to compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=365.973s">It</a>  has passed and we feel that this will help the morale of some of our veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=374.641s">Most</a>  of them are the average age now is about 70 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=378.884s">They</a>  don't get out very much and we do bring them in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=382.608s">And</a>  we want to make it comfortable for them and so they can enjoy themselves and have a hot dog or something of that nature.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=397.327s">Again,</a>  I've put in the American Legion post. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=402.652s">We</a>  appreciate everything you've done for our country and all the members, and I see that you've done everything that's required through our licensing department, so I move forward for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=414.321s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=415.322s">Second,</a>  Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=416.503s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=417.684s">In</a>  the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Caviello.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=424.93s">Counselor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=426.05s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=428.331s">This</a>  is a very important paper to the membership of American Legion Post 45. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=432.233s">And</a>  in full disclosure, I've been a Sal in the past, a son of the American Legion member there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=437.374s">And</a>  what this paper does is it allows them to operate underneath the governor's guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=441.836s">The</a>  post has been shut down now since about St. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=444.637s">Patrick's</a>  Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=445.657s">And</a>  they haven't had the ability to generate any income whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=448.838s">And</a>  that coupled with the fact that this veteran's organization does provide great support services for young and old veterans here in the community of Medford and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=457.004s">That</a>  coupled with the fact that the American Legion Post 45 and its membership are always the first ones to step up when the city of Medford needs something, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=465.509s">If</a>  you look to election day on September 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=468.991s">When</a>  the Lawrence Memorial Hospital was unable to host us for our election proceedings, the first people to step up to the plate were Richard Mott and Bobby Miller in American Legion Post 45. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=478.814s">And</a>  when we celebrate our Memorial Day ceremonies, Mr. President, and we all go down to <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=486.016s">Oak</a>  Grove Cemetery and we sit there and we listen to the beautiful presentations put on by our veterans organizations and as we sit there we see those flags all across the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=495.973s">American</a>  Legion Post 45 is the group that coordinates. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=499.994s">The</a>  placing of those flags on our veterans' grave markers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=502.616s">So</a>  it's very important, Mr. President, that we recognize the work and the partnership that the American Legion has provided the citizens and the residents in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=509.821s">And</a>  I think it's very important for us to adopt and embrace this opportunity for them to get a common victuals license so that they have the opportunity to reopen and generate some revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=518.887s">And</a>  also allow the membership, the opportunity to come back in and to continue their mutual support relationship that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=526.011s">When</a>  we look at the agenda later on this evening, we have a paper talking about substance abuse and addiction recovery services and the ability to have meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=534.154s">And</a>  veterans organizations, although they don't necessarily hold meetings per se, are a great spot for veterans to congregate, to get together, and to talk about their shared mutual experiences and how to go through some of the struggles that they're having. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=545.438s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, this is a paper that I support wholeheartedly, and I'd ask my council colleagues to also join me in supporting it.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=551.36s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=554.341s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=556.054s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=557.195s">I,</a>  too, want to reiterate my support for Post 45. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=561.479s">They've</a>  been longstanding members of this community, very active and involved in this community, and good neighbors for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=570.127s">And</a>  I stand here tonight, Mr. President, to support them as they've supported members of this community for the last several decades, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=577.754s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=578.274s">Thank</a>  you, Counselor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=581.517s">Anybody</a>  else? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=583.063s">Okay,</a>  so on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, Chairperson of Licensing, seconded by Vice President Carabiello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=590.929s">Clerk</a>  Bernabease, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Powers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=902.453s">Yes,</a>  I believe it's two inches past <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=908.164s">and</a>  my designer had done that pretty much to stay with the other signs that were in station landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=916.23s">I</a>  guess they all ended up petitioning for the same type of variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=921.695s">And</a>  so it's kind of keeping with the same look. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=924.577s">We</a>  had applied for 32 inches depth compared to 30 inches.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=930.322s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=932.584s">Any</a>  questions from the council?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=935.606s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=937.959s">Vice</a>  President Caviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=938.979s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=939.519s">It</a>  looks like there are only a few inches over the allowed sided, so I don't see a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=955.064s">So,</a>  I motion for approval.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=957.764s">Okay,</a>  the motion of Vice President Caraviello, seconded by- Second. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=962.646s">Council</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=964.909s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=965.97s">Mr.</a>  President, at the end of our packet, there's a letter by Mr. Paris, and I think it's a very good explanation of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=973.2s">Dear</a>  members of the city council, regarding our sign request for Liv's Juice and a Kai bar located at 56 Stations Landing, my understanding is that we're allowed two feet of projection. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=982.512s">Since</a>  our 24 inch sign is circular, the total square foot is just 3.16 square feet, as opposed to the total four square foot sign that's allowed by the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=991.155s">The</a>  mounting of the sign is flush to the building and would look very funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=993.776s">And</a>  as a result, we're asking for four additional inches of projection for the standoffs to make it fit within the neighborhood and uphold the great look there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1001.358s">Mr.</a>  President, I personally find a circular sign more aesthetically pleasing than a big square or rectangular sign sticking off the side of a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1007.541s">I</a>  think Mr. Paris has given us a great explanation, and although it doesn't present a significant hardship, it certainly does present some curb appeal issues that this council has discussed in the past, and I support this paper wholeheartedly.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1019.306s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1020.906s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1023.267s">If</a>  you can, is this line, I'm not seeing if it's illuminated.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1029.704s">Mr.</a>  Parris?</p>

    <p>[Powers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1030.244s">It</a>  is internally lit, yes, that's correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1035.065s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1036.605s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Parris. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1038.446s">Any</a>  other questions from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1041.946s">Okay,</a>  on the motion of Vice President Caviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1047.007s">Seconded</a>  by, Clerk, would you give him a second?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1053.368s">It</a>  was Councilor Morell.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1054.529s">It</a>  was Councilor Morell? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1055.289s">Okay,</a>  I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1057.972s">I</a>  thought Councilor Bears had the second, but we said it at the same time.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1062.776s">Okay,</a>  so Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1064.697s">Let's</a>  see, we have Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1066.438s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1069.541s">Mr.</a>  President, does the owner of the property have plans to turn the sign off after hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1077.327s">Mr.</a>  Parris, can you comment on that?</p>

    <p>[Costas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1080.013s">I'm</a>  sorry, did you say the owner of the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1082.074s">I</a>  believe ours is separate.</p>

    <p>[Powers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1087.915s">But</a>  we can program however need be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1089.836s">So</a>  whether it's for during business hours or from dusk till dawn, whatever we need to, we can program it.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1097.758s">I</a>  would state, Mr. President, to be consistent, and I've voted like this in the past, that the sign be turned off when the business is not in operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1106.772s">Okay,</a>  are you writing that as an amendment to the- I would like to hear what my other council colleagues would like to say on that, and I would have that as an amendment, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1115.217s">Okay,</a>  so that is an amendment by Councilor Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1119.519s">And</a>  we'll get some, would any of the councils like to comment on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1122.841s">Councilor</a>  Bears?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1124.551s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1125.571s">I'm</a>  fine with that, as long as it's within the control of the business, as long as the property owner isn't the one who controls the light switch. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1134.114s">We're</a>  just having a little bit of feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1135.575s">I</a>  think there were too many mics turned on, so that's directed to you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1140.617s">I</a>  think we're fine now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1141.497s">It</a>  looks like they're off. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1142.897s">Yeah,</a>  we're fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1143.698s">Great,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1144.638s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1148.67s">I</a>  know our ordinance speaks to the signs not being illuminated after 10 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1152.833s">Anyhow,</a>  what are the hours of the gentleman's operations?</p>

    <p>[Powers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1156.456s">We</a>  actually have two sets of hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1159.918s">Our</a>  fall hours just went into effect where we're actually closing at 4 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1164.482s">But</a>  our summer hours, we close at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1168.785s">But</a>  I can tell you that just walking up and down Station Landing at night, I believe that a lot of the businesses</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1190.485s">So</a>  I would ask with consistency, Mr. President, that the light be turned off. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1194.187s">If</a>  the audience is 10, that's fine.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1196.908s">But</a>  whatever the practices at stations landing, I mean, I'm not opposed to the measure at all, counselor.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1201.31s">I</a>  don't want to come across- I just want to be consistent, because I know when station landing came aboard, we spent a lot of time working on the signage to make sure that it was aesthetically pleasing, because there are a number of residents that live in station landing.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1216.476s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1216.816s">And</a>  we have to be mindful of that as well.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1218.757s">So</a>  is the amendment, I just want to be clear, so is the amendment that the sign gets turned off when the rest of the signs at the stations get turned off?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1225.661s">I</a>  would say that it conforms with the existing sign ordinance, which I believe Councilman Knight is correct, that 10 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1232.006s">the</a>  sign be turned off. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1232.946s">10</a>  p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1234.527s">10</a>  p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1235.208s">10</a>  p.m.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1236.368s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1237.069s">Clerk,</a>  do you have the amendment?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1239.49s">Working</a>  on it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1246.495s">So</a>  the amendment is to <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1249.669s">is</a>  to shut off the lights in accordance with the existing ordinance and shut the lights off at 10 p.m.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1254.252s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1262.018s">Thank</a>  you, Clerk Urtubis. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1262.958s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1265.08s">Councilor</a>  Knight, did you have a comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1266.441s">You're</a>  all set?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1325.516s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1326.317s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1327.882s">Mister</a>  had a call at 730 she would be back on the zoom meeting at 745.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1333.13s">All</a>  right, no worries. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1334.151s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1337.376s">So</a>  we'll go to 20-565. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1343.578s">Petition</a>  to reverse sign denial by Best Price Signs in printing for Prestige Car Wash. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1350.524s">277</a>  Middlesex Ave, Medford, Massachusetts, OCD. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1353.807s">Application</a>  six, exceeds allowable area of secondary signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1360.112s">Do</a>  we have anyone on the call from Best Practice Signs? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1364.516s">We</a>  do, right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1368.819s">Gilmour,</a>  if we could please have your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1371.823s">Yeah,</a>  my name is Guilmar Silva. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1374.245s">I'm</a>  at 1034 North Montelli Street in Brock, Ramirez. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1378.149s">I'm</a>  from the sign company.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1381.292s">From</a>  the sign company, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1382.173s">Can</a>  you tell us a little bit about your sign?</p>

    <p>[Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1386.597s">Yes,</a>  technically, he has the windows, he want to put a yoni on the top of the windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1396.755s">just</a>  to make the place look beautiful, look a little bit better. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1401.597s">It's</a>  just you don't have any lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1403.899s">I'm</a>  going to only put the logo of the company, the name Free Vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1408.121s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1409.181s">Each</a>  only. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1410.022s">No</a>  lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1412.543s">It's</a>  just canvas and aluminum. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1415.404s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1420.307s">That's</a>  going to be between each vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1424.514s">I</a>  don't know if you guys have the photo I do have over here with me.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1428.922s">Yes,</a>  we do have a photo in a package here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1433.25s">Yes,</a>  we have a question from, we have Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1437.066s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President, again, at the end of this application, there's also a letter dated March 3rd, 2020 from Mr. DeSilva at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1443.868s">I</a>  guess March 3rd is when he requested his appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1447.188s">And</a>  it reads, the purpose of these proposed awnings is to provide protection from the environment, enhance the appeal of the car wash, and instruct customers of free vacuum services in an attractive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1457.031s">Despite</a>  the weather conditions, customers will be comfortable vacuuming their vehicles under the shade and shelter of the awning. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1462.032s">And</a>  the awnings are not only to benefit the customer's comfort, but also create a more attractive facade. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1466.294s">Finally,</a>  the awnings instruct the customers where the free vacuums are located and create a clear space to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1472.516s">So</a>  Mr. President, it seems like they're seeking 13 awnings, one over each vacuum that look like to be canvas awnings that aren't internally illuminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1484.3s">But</a>  I do believe that they would have certain public safety benefit instructing <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1492.033s">where</a>  the free vacuums are in a location like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1494.814s">I</a>  believe this is the old Randy's Car Wash on Middlesex Ave, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1499.216s">They've</a>  always done a pretty good job over there at Randy's, and I don't think that the new operator would be any less successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1506.879s">And</a>  I can certainly support a reversal on the sign denial, but is 13 really the number that we want to approve, I guess is the question.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1522.255s">If</a>  you have a comment, we'll hear from some of the councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1524.618s">Councilor</a>  Knight, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1525.699s">Let's</a>  see, we have Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1528.483s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1529.684s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1530.205s">Thank</a>  you, President Falcone. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1531.407s">I</a>  know my concern also falls with the number of signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1537.173s">To</a>  have one sign that says free vacuums, I think we can all see, we all know the location, we all see the vacuums. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1544.337s">But</a>  to have 13 signs, I'm just a little nervous of what would be added after that on those awnings, or what's hung on those awnings and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1555.484s">So</a>  I'd like to hear what my fellow councilors have to say, but I just think this might be a little excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1564.129s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1565.196s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1567.117s">We</a>  have Councilor Marks, and then we have Councilor Bears, and then Councilor Carriello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1573.158s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1574.819s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and I happen to frequent this car wash where I live right up the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1582.441s">And</a>  let me tell you, there's no mistaking that there's free vacuum at that particular car wash. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1589.483s">There</a>  is banners on the fence, there are signs everywhere saying free car wash. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1596.866s">You</a>  can't help but drive by, I mean a free vacuum, and notice that there's free vacuuming there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1603.869s">I</a>  would also state that these particular awnings, according to the letter we received that Councilor Night just read, state that the awnings come off the building two feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1616.129s">So</a>  to state that this would be comfortable vacuuming their vehicles under the shade and shelter of the awning, I don't know how you create shade and shelter of a two foot awning coming off the side of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1630.914s">Because</a>  the vacuum is in front of the car, which is a pretty big, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1636.956s">piece</a>  of equipment, there's no way that provides shelter for anyone that's vacuuming, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1644.243s">I</a>  think the awnings may be a nice addition to the building without signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1649.868s">So</a>  if the gentleman wanted to put 12 awnings and maybe one or two free vacuum, or maybe even three depending on the wish of the council, I would be amendable to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1663.461s">Because</a>  I think the building could use, it's just a squared off building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1668.368s">Aesthetically</a>  speaking, it's not that pleasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1671.232s">Maybe</a>  these awnings will make it look more pleasing, but to have it on each awning, Mr. President, is overkill. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1679.364s">And</a>  it doesn't serve the purpose of shade or shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1682.886s">And</a>  so I would put in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that out of the request for 13 canvas awnings, that we allow 13 awnings, but only three with signage that states free vacuum.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1703.756s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1704.516s">I</a>  would second that motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1707.839s">For</a>  it's often in the form of a I guess it would be a restriction correct counsel, right?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1714.522s">The</a>  second bike was that counselor night Excuse me So one minute please so we have a motion by counselor Mark seconded by a council night to allow the 13 awnings But only three with signage am I correct correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1732.491s">Okay</a>  quick her to be you had that Yes</p>

    <p>[Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1737.23s">So</a>  move Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1761.713s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1762.673s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1764.474s">Also,</a>  if I could, and I realize the banners are probably up temporarily because it doesn't really, other than the banners, there's nothing else that says free vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1776.217s">I</a>  would hope as soon as the awnings go up that those temporary banners come off that are on the fence and around the property, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1788.953s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1790.654s">So</a>  we have a number of other Councilors that want to speak on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1793.536s">We</a>  have, let's see, I have up next Councilor Beers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1796.858s">Councilor</a>  Beers.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1797.978s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1799.019s">Councilor</a>  Marks and the petitioner answered my question, so I'm all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1802.361s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1802.781s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1802.961s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Beers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1804.702s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1806.743s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1807.644s">Similarly,</a>  I thank Councilor Marks for bringing forward that language because I wholeheartedly agree and support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1813.728s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1815.572s">Thank</a>  you, Council Member.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1816.572s">Vice</a>  President Carviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1818.213s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1818.994s">Same</a>  thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1820.434s">I'll</a>  support the signs and to make sure that those banners come down after the awnings are up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1827.878s">Because,</a>  and again, I think three is more than enough to have free vacuums on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1835.801s">So</a>  I support Council Member's motion also.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1838.462s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Carviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1840.983s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1841.844s">Move</a>  the question.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1843.424s">On</a>  the motion of. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1845.58s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1848.761s">Can</a>  I interrupt for a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1850.482s">I'm</a>  unclear, I got Councilor Marks' original motion to approve the 13 audits, but only allow three with the signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1858.945s">Does</a>  the motion also include that the temporary planners come down when the audits go up, or is that just a request?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1866.608s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1868.488s">Yes,</a>  let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1870.089s">Councilor</a>  Marks, you're on.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1874.498s">This</a>  may be a question for the building commissioner in his office, but I believe any banners in the city, Mr. President, have to be permitted and approved for businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1889.006s">And</a>  I believe it's on a temporary basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1891.107s">I'm</a>  not sure if these banners are approved or if they, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1897.31s">But</a>  I would ask as part of this paper that they be taken down as soon as the awnings go up.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2318.105s">I</a>  think it's the south elevation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2326.134s">I</a>  mean, I think it's the one that was approved by Wright faces the building that Margarita's used to be in.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2344.042s">There</a>  seems to be some concern whether or not, I think, is it maybe the north side of the building faces a residential building, if I'm correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2354.415s">We're</a>  going to take a look right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2355.416s">One</a>  minute, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2356.857s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2357.658s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2435.932s">It</a>  does face the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2438.454s">Maybe</a>  3 stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2438.814s">Well,</a>  it does face the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2441.436s">And</a>  that's your call.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_39]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2458.434s">Mr.</a>  President, in the past, if I may.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2462.576s">Oh,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2463.797s">Consul,</a>  one minute, Consul Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2466.299s">Consul</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2467.039s">In</a>  the past, Mr. President, when a circumstance like this has arose, what we've done is put a 30, 60, or 90 day review on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2474.444s">I</a>  don't know if that's something we wanna do in this situation or circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2478.206s">I</a>  haven't gotten any complaints <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2481.328s">from</a>  anybody regarding the sign at 75 stations landing to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2486.051s">So</a>  I don't find it to be a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2488.432s">However,</a>  if it does become an issue because of the action of this council, I think that we should absolutely have the ability to give it a review to make sure that we're not disrupting anybody's quality of life that resides in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2499.298s">Well,</a>  at the same time, still supporting the application of the Fairfield Marriott Hotels. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2504.703s">We</a>  all understand the benefits that having an additional hotel in our community is going to bring to us financially. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2509.348s">And</a>  historically, they've been a good partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2512.03s">Our</a>  other two hotels have been great partners here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2515.234s">So</a>  I don't want to, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2520.163s">I</a>  don't want to claim nefarious intent, but at the same time, I think it's important that we protect the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2524.505s">So</a>  I would offer a 30 and 60 day review on the paper and move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2529.688s">For</a>  the sign only facing 75 stations only.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2533.569s">So,</a>  Clerk Hertoghese, I'm not sure if you got that amendment by Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2538.372s">I'm</a>  sorry, I don't know if 75 is the address, but the north facing sign abutting the residential property.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2544.474s">Do</a>  you have that, Clerk Hertoghese? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2546.655s">Working</a>  on it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2554.697s">Councilmarks</a>  one minute, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2556.078s">We</a>  have actually council beers and then let me read this back Yes Councilman is offering an amendment requesting a 30 to 60 day review for the north-facing sign that it is a budding resident the residential property.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_41]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2570.035s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2570.355s">I</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2575.925s">Okay,</a>  so that is an amendment by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2578.267s">We</a>  have Councilor Beers and Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2580.128s">Councilor</a>  Beers.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2581.228s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2582.089s">Through</a>  you to the petitioner, will these illuminated signs be shut off at 10 p.m.?</p>

    <p>[Dutko]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2590.634s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2590.814s">Duggo?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2592.616s">Perhaps</a>  Evan could address that?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2601.641s">Evan,</a>  are you still on the call?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2605.336s">He's</a>  still on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2606.597s">Yes,</a>  I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2607.538s">Sorry,</a>  I was muted. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2609.0s">The</a>  hotel operates 24 hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2613.504s">We</a>  have guests arriving at all hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2615.907s">The</a>  AC hotel next door, which we own and operate, was therefore permitted to have the signs illuminated 24 hours a day or from dusk till dawn for the safety of our guests. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2628.139s">I'm</a>  not aware of any complaints regarding the illumination of that signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2631.742s">And</a>  we do, as mentioned, have signs on that building facing the residential structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2636.807s">These</a>  are not glaring signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2639.509s">They</a>  are illuminated, but there's no glare coming from them.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2644.834s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2646.235s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Pierce. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2652.12s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2653.521s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2656.178s">Are</a>  they able to control the lumens on the signage itself?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2666.766s">Eben,</a>  are you able to answer that question?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2669.488s">Yeah,</a>  I'm not aware of an ability to control the lumens. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2674.052s">There's</a>  not a dimmer on the signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2677.774s">They</a>  are <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2680.126s">It's</a>  fairly unobtrusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2681.967s">I</a>  think it's going to be a similar sign output to what we already have on the AC hotel. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2687.029s">And</a>  while it's illuminated, it's not something that causes any discomfort to the eyes or irritates neighboring residents that I'm aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2696.133s">We've</a>  not received any complaints through the city or from any neighbors.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2700.074s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2701.855s">So</a>  we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2704.716s">If</a>  we put a 30 or 60 day review, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2708.738s">And</a>  after 30 or 60 days, this council sees fit that we received a certain number of complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2715.905s">I'm</a>  sure the hotel wouldn't want to remove a $50,000, $60,000 sign based on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2722.751s">So</a>  I would ask that as part of this, Mr. President, that they put up a sign that they can control the Lumens. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2729.798s">And</a>  that way, if there is a concern, we may be able to go back to the owner of the property and state that the brightness is bothering people or whatever it might be, and have some flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2741.862s">And</a>  that's the only reason why I bring it up, Mr. President, because once the sign goes up, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2746.324s">And</a>  if we do vote at a later date to take it down, that would be of great hardship, I'm sure, to the petitioner, and I wouldn't want to put them in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2755.47s">So</a>  maybe if they can look at a sign that they can control the lumens, we'll be able to address any issues, because that would be my issue, the brightness of the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2764.356s">I</a>  understand the petitioner saying they're not that bright, but if they're able to get a sign where they can control that one in particular, not all of them, that one in particular I think would be helpful for not only them, but for us as a council.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2778.845s">to</a>  the sign manufacturer and to that side, knowing that this is a concern of the Council and potentially neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2788.847s">something</a>  that we don't typically do, but I'm sure that we can make that accommodation so that we don't have to turn off the sign permanently. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2796.708s">We'd</a>  rather be able to dim it to a level that was acceptable to the neighbors.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2800.865s">So</a>  I'd ask that that be part of the recommendation, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2803.887s">So</a>  why that is an amendment as well?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2805.488s">An</a>  amendment that the sign contain a dimming aspect on the north, facing the north side. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2810.771s">So</a>  I'd ask Councilor Night to amend his motion.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2816.195s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2816.515s">So</a>  do you have that amendment as well, Clerk Hurtubise? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2820.057s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2820.678s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2821.098s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2821.598s">Councilor</a>  Marks, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2823.7s">Councilor</a>  Night.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2825.465s">So</a>  Mr. President, just to be clear, this application before us is just for the permit to reverse the sign denial. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2832.808s">And</a>  any type of relief sought by the applicant relative to hours of operation outside of the ordinance and its 7 AM to 10 PM requirements would have to be sought under a different cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2844.131s">That's</a>  not going to be covered under the aspect of the vote that we're taking this evening.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2852.622s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2853.383s">Any</a>  other questions or comments from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2857.486s">Okay,</a>  I don't see anybody's hand raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2861.81s">I</a>  think we're good here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2862.73s">So</a>  on the motion of Vice President Carabiello, seconded by Councilor Morell, as amended by Councilor Knight and Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2873.359s">Clerk,</a>  please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3028.347s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3030.908s">Yeah,</a>  I think you almost had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3039.687s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3039.888s">Craig.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3040.028s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3040.971s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3042.174s">Yes,</a>  can we please have your name and address for the record? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3044.34s">And</a>  then if you could please give us a brief synopsis of the project.</p>

    <p>[Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3047.503s">My</a>  name is Diana Cuddy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3048.483s">I</a>  live at 21 Judith Lane, Mansfield, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3050.444s">I'm</a>  here representing Boston Gas doing business as National Grid, requesting permission to install approximately 650 feet of a new four-inch plastic gas main extension, a small piece of it starting on Williams Street, going into Somerville, which is most of the length of the main extension, and then going up Medford Street to service a new construction at 87 Medford Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3075.888s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3077.609s">So</a>  let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3080.732s">And</a>  if I may, I'm going to just read that this was approved by the chief engineer with the following conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3086.397s">The</a>  engineering division recommends that the grant of location be approved with the following conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3090.82s">Number</a>  one, the grant of location is limited to the approximately 60 feet of gas main in one service located in Medford that is part of the larger project described in the GOL documents as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3103.951s">To</a>  install and maintain approximately 650 feet of a new 4-inch plastic main extension from the existing 4-inch plastic main in Williams Street going on to Broadway and to the service location in Medford Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3118.403s">Number</a>  two, before starting work, the contractor shall notify DigSafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3122.987s">It</a>  shall obtain all applicable permits from the engineering division. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3126.669s">The</a>  project must obtain a street opening permit pursuant to section 74-141 of the city ordinances prior to commencing work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3135.834s">Medford</a>  Street was rebuilt within the last five. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3139.602s">years</a>  and is restricted from receiving a SOP without direct approval from the Commissioner of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3147.207s">At</a>  a minimum, the SOP application must include a street restoration plan for review and approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3154.232s">At</a>  a minimum, the street restoration plan must include curb-to-curb paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3159.397s">The</a>  SOP application must also include a traffic management plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3164.561s">Number</a>  three, no other utility structures, conduits, duct banks, pipes, or any other appearances are adversely impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3173.809s">The</a>  National Grid shall ensure that all sewer water and drain lines are marked prior to any excavation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3180.935s">Any</a>  disturbed concrete sidewalk panels shall be replaced in kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3186.079s">Asphalt</a>  must be replaced with asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3189.38s">There</a>  are multiple broken concrete panels clustered at the vicinity of the point of entry for the gas service. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3196.282s">This</a>  cluster should be replaced as part of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3199.463s">Number</a>  four, the sidewalk and street restoration shall be done in consultation with the engineering division and per the requirements of the approved street opening permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3209.525s">Number</a>  five, pavement markings including the hatch pattern must be restored. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3216.767s">Number</a>  six, the project site must be swept daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3220.569s">It</a>  shall be kept free of debris for the duration of the installation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3225.492s">And</a>  those are the, basically that was approved and those were the conditions that were put forth by our city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3234.078s">So</a>  at this point, I would declare the public hearing open. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3237.74s">It</a>  opened to those in favor of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3240.422s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3240.622s">Cuddy,</a>  if you could just please give your name and address for the record again.</p>

    <p>[Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3243.904s">I</a>  believe you are in favor, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3246.158s">Yes,</a>  Diana Cuddy, 21 Judy's Lane, Mansfield, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3249.621s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3250.341s">Would</a>  anyone else at this point in time like to speak in favor of the project?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3259.148s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3259.548s">I</a>  don't see anyone that wants to speak in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3261.65s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3265.473s">So</a>  seeing and hearing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3269.456s">Anyone</a>  in opposition of the petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3271.717s">Is</a>  there anyone in opposition of the petition that would like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3284.773s">Okay,</a>  seeing and hearing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3291.195s">At</a>  this point in time, are there any questions from the council?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3294.817s">Motion</a>  for approval, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3296.617s">We</a>  have a motion of Council of Marks to approve, seconded by- Second. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3301.239s">Councilor</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3302.9s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3304.425s">Mr.</a>  President, through you, I was wondering if the petitioner could tell me on what side of the retaining wall on Broadway is this trench going to be dug? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3312.549s">Is</a>  it going to be on the northern side of the retaining wall or on the southern side? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3316.731s">If</a>  you're familiar with the area and you're driving up from Winter Hill and Somerville along Broadway, you'll come to the intersection of Medford Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3326.036s">There</a>  at that intersection, by way of history, is Paul Revere Park, which is the smallest park in the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3332.08s">But</a>  I digress, Mr. President, as you go past Paul Revere Park, Broadway splits in two, and you can go up Broadway and travel along the Medford border. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3341.005s">Some</a>  of that is Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3342.706s">Or</a>  you can stay on Broadway proper and go straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3346.687s">So</a>  I was wondering exactly where this trench was going to be dug, because there is a Broadway in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3352.029s">And</a>  it's the roadway that runs parallel to Broadway in Somerville, right where that split is, where it goes up and over the ridge and comes back down and brings you out where the old Salvation Army used to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3364.413s">right</a>  at Winter Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3365.313s">So</a>  I was wondering if the applicant could tell us where the trench is actually going to be dug. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3369.015s">Is</a>  it going to be dug on Broadway proper or is it going to be dug on that one-way access road?</p>

    <p>[Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3375.097s">So</a>  included in the application was a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3378.459s">The</a>  existing gas main will tie into the proposed gas main will tie into the existing one on Williams Street, which is closest to, I'm going to say, the northeast side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3390.478s">And</a>  then it will travel along Broadway on the northern side, on the Medford, closer to the Medford side.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3397.361s">So</a>  do we know which side of that retaining wall it's going to be on, I guess, is the question.</p>

    <p>[Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3403.924s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3404.665s">There's</a>  a retaining wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3405.745s">I</a>  don't see that on the plan.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3407.946s">Nor</a>  do I. So if you're looking at Medford Street at the intersection, you see that little park?</p>

    <p>[Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3415.57s">I</a>  do.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3416.39s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3416.67s">If</a>  you go past the little park, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3419.462s">There's</a>  a line with a little square. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3422.764s">And</a>  that line with a little square, I think that's a street that comes right through there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3429.168s">So</a>  I just don't know what side of the wall that proposed gas main is going to be on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3434.531s">Is</a>  it going to be on Broadway proper, or is it going to be on the access road?</p>

    <p>[Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3442.295s">It</a>  can go on either one, whatever.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3443.776s">I</a>  would much rather prefer it to be on Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3448.114s">I'm</a>  not in Medford, personally.</p>

    <p>[Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3451.335s">Because</a>  we try to avoid retaining walls, as you can imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3455.016s">Something</a>  like this, I didn't see the city engineer make a note of this in his condition, so I'm wondering if maybe this is something we could look into a little bit and have on the permit.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3471.44s">My</a>  colleagues are following me with what I'm talking about, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3473.4s">You</a>  guys know what I'm saying?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3474.34s">I</a>  think it's on the other side of the intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3476.141s">I</a>  might be wrong, too.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_41]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3483.527s">Dexter</a>  Street is Big Bundle.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3503.221s">We</a>  just need a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3504.502s">We're</a>  taking a look at the diagram.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3524.707s">I'm</a>  sorry, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3526.868s">That's</a>  Main Street, the little park, not Medford Street.</p>

    <p>[Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3532.211s">I</a>  don't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3532.872s">I'm</a>  looking on Google.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3534.032s">Main</a>  Street and Medford Street split. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3535.894s">Main</a>  Street goes further to the, I guess it would be east, and Medford Street goes up past those parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3543.418s">So</a>  I was confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3544.178s">I</a>  had, because Dexter Street threw me off, because Dexter's <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3547.639s">Dexter</a>  runs through Maine to Medford, so this is further down. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3552.103s">Creative</a>  Science is on the corner here of Dexter and- You are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3557.188s">So</a>  this will be going, there is no retaining wall, so this is all going in front of- Trump Field. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3561.992s">The</a>  pizza place, Dacos Tavern, the Chinese food restaurant coming around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3566.716s">Okay,</a>  yep, I second the motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3571.26s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3575.894s">Were</a>  there any other questions regarding this? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3580.516s">If</a>  I may, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3581.017s">Cuddy,</a>  the engineer mentions in his notes that, let's see, there are multiple broken concrete panels clustered at the vicinity of the point of entry for the gas service. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3595.524s">This</a>  cluster should be replaced as part of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3598.205s">Are</a>  those gonna be replaced with concrete? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3601.407s">Yes,</a>  they will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3602.667s">They</a>  will be, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3606.158s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3610.125s">This</a>  is a service call. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3611.628s">I</a>  know that there's some discussion in here about an SOP. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3614.413s">So</a>  SOP means that the applicant <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3618.973s">would</a>  provide the city with the funds to then go and perform, no, that's a street opening permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3624.797s">That's</a>  a different program. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3625.797s">I</a>  guess the question is, is the 60 feet of roadway that's being torn up in Medford going to be replaced curb to curb? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3632.161s">Where</a>  this is creation of new service, we're tearing up a couple of roadways 60 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3636.864s">Are</a>  we going to be able to get curb to curb restoration?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3641.48s">I</a>  think it's part of the engineers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3643.982s">Recommendations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3644.743s">His</a>  recommendation is for which</p>

    <p>[Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3668.294s">the</a>  city engineer would make these conditions of the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3670.935s">So</a>  they're... Correct.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3672.476s">That's</a>  part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3673.136s">Point</a>  number 2, at a minimum, the street restoration plan must include curb-to-curb paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3678.818s">The</a>  SOP application must also include a traffic management plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3682.599s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3683.159s">It's</a>  at the top of page 27.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_41]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3691.704s">Yes,</a>  I see it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3692.445s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4616.403s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4618.043s">From</a>  my brief calculations, it looks like this application seeks for about a half a mile of a ground opening permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4627.385s">Does</a>  that sound correct, sir?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4631.106s">Mr.</a>  Franks.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4632.47s">That</a>  sounds about right, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4634.452s">2600</a>  feet or something like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4636.094s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4636.795s">And</a>  it goes right through our central business district, Mr. President, one that we've been talking about for as long as I can remember in terms of what we're going to do to revitalize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4647.225s">The</a>  lack of commitment to revitalize Medford Square coupled with <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4651.994s">the</a>  impacts of the Kranich Bridge closure for such an extended period of time, along with the COVID-19 situation that's happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4664.725s">We</a>  have a number of restaurants and places that provide food services along this stretch, and the impact that they've <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4675.561s">The</a>  financial impact that they've had to put up with through a variety of different reasons over the course of the last five years is troublesome, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4684.204s">So</a>  I guess this is a long way of asking a question, and the question is, how long will this construction take?</p>

    <p>[Franks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4698.199s">the</a>  construction crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4701.962s">But,</a>  you know, once we get in the, once we're able to get in the ground, we can move pretty quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4709.888s">It's,</a>  you know, a matter of days, not weeks.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4714.151s">Okay,</a>  so you think you guys can do 100 feet a day? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4718.294s">More</a>  than 100 feet a day?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4719.395s">Easily.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4720.255s">Easily.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4721.016s">Easily.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4721.396s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4722.156s">What</a>  are the plans in terms of the storage of equipment and materials during the construction period?</p>

    <p>[Franks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4731.862s">We</a>  shouldn't really need to store anything on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4740.768s">It</a>  might be helpful if you can unmute my colleague, Dave Zuwahling, who's <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4746.676s">He</a>  said 6, 1, 7, 2, 7, 9, 7, 8, 6, 4.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4750.079s">Is</a>  everybody at home getting this in case they have a problem during the construction?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4755.323s">Here</a>  he is, OK.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4759.386s">Mr.</a>  Flewelling, I'm trying to unmute you now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4762.248s">OK,</a>  he should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4768.372s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4769.553s">Hi,</a>  if you could please give me a name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4772.655s">Yes,</a>  James Flewelling, Corncastle, New Enfanceville, Rubin, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4776.732s">I'd</a>  be happy to help answer any questions you have.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4780.533s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4782.354s">Will</a>  the public way be used for the overnight storage of equipment and materials? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4787.755s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4788.775s">Can</a>  we put that as a condition?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4794.217s">Was</a>  that a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4794.797s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4795.597s">Okay,</a>  excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4796.517s">So</a>  I'd like to offer that in the form of an amendment number 18, Mr. President, as a condition that there'll be no storage of any equipment or materials on the public way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4802.939s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4804.04s">With</a>  that being said, I rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4805.18s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4806.021s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4808.482s">We</a>  have Councilor Beers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4809.943s">You</a>  had a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4811.384s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4811.524s">OK,</a>  Councilor Beers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4812.264s">Am</a>  I good to go?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4816.386s">You're</a>  good to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4817.367s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4817.807s">Do</a>  we have the city engineer?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4820.768s">The</a>  city engineer I don't think is with us.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4823.35s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4826.311s">I</a>  guess then just to the petitioners, when will this construction start? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4832.335s">Is</a>  this next spring? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4833.336s">Is</a>  it this fall?</p>

    <p>[Franks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4835.898s">We</a>  would very much like to get this done before the moratorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4840.402s">Someone</a>  mentioned COVID earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4843.925s">We</a>  are getting a lot of calls from the residents and businesses there that they need a modern internet connection in today's world. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4852.512s">So</a>  we'd like to get it to them before the winter.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4855.529s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4855.949s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4856.35s">And</a>  I mean, my question for the engineer would be why, why are there 18 now conditions, but he's not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4862.134s">So</a>  that's okay.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4864.917s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4865.217s">Council</a>  appears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4870.361s">Cause</a>  there'll be, you're all set, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4871.502s">Perfect.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4872.943s">Vice-president</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4877.967s">We'll</a>  be having happening in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4879.328s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4888.382s">in</a>  the evening, I think was the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4891.144s">I</a>  believe that question would be up to the engineer when we apply for the street opening permit, what the limits of the working hours would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4899.609s">It</a>  would probably make a lot more sense to do the work at night and less impact to the businesses, and this is a heavily trafficked area. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4909.814s">We</a>  do have a traffic plan all prepared and ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4912.816s">depending</a>  upon if the petition and the project is approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4917.501s">That's</a>  certainly something we can entertain doing the work at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4921.326s">We'd</a>  probably be able to get more work done at night versus during the day, certainly.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4925.78s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, because like Mayor DeCosta said, this is an area already impacted by other circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4933.923s">And</a>  to take away their parking spots, and some of them have outdoor dining in that area, would be more cumbersome than they already have. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4942.445s">So</a>  if you could do this at night, after 10 o'clock, it would be greatly appreciated to all the businesses that are in that area.</p>

    <p>[Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4953.024s">We</a>  have done work at night on High Street in the past when we did 84 and 92 High Street, so we can certainly do the night work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4960.587s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4962.248s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Carviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4966.55s">Any</a>  other questions for the Council?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4970.592s">Motion</a>  to approve.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4971.292s">Okay,</a>  on the motion to approve, motion by Councilor Behr, seconded.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4977.195s">As</a>  amended.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4978.823s">Second,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4979.624s">Well,</a>  the motion of Council of Bears is amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Carviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4984.887s">Clerk</a>  Hurnaby, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5290.278s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5292.919s">I</a>  didn't have my hand up yet, but I was going to put it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5298.462s">We've</a>  had a lot of discussion about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5300.263s">We</a>  went on a site visit yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5301.804s">I</a>  think the discussion in our committee of the whole Allen site showed us that we are really close here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5308.047s">I</a>  think that the property owner <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5311.946s">and</a>  the members of the historic commission, the historic district commission are close, and I think we should encourage that compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5318.409s">But</a>  I also think that what's before us tonight is the question of whether 16 Foster Court and the 200-year-old structure on the lot warrants a historic district designation, and I think from the evidence we've been shown, it absolutely does. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5330.654s">I'm</a>  heartened by the efforts of the property owner to reach compromise, and now, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5337.697s">I'm</a>  concerned that if we don't approve the district that the compromise won't be reached and one of the last pieces of the shipbuilding history of our city, which as we know is an important part of our city's history, will be demolished on October 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5352.509s">Now</a>  that the community process is underway, and now that it's clear that the developer and the Historical Commission and the Historic District Commission are near to a good faith compromise, I think we should approve the district, ensuring that the community process can continue without the threat of demolition hanging over the discussions and the goal of compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5369.551s">I</a>  think 16 Foster Court clearly deserves the historic designation, regardless of the compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5375.335s">I'm</a>  hopeful that it will keep the facade of the building and that we can really celebrate the shipbuilding history of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5384.222s">But</a>  that designation certainly would not preclude moving forward with development, and I think all parties involved are ready to have that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5391.167s">So</a>  I think we should advance this, but I welcome hearing from my other counselors. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5397.292s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5398.66s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5399.04s">Thank</a>  you console beers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5400.201s">So</a>  when you were saying are you advancing it?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5426.459s">Mr.</a>  President, I personally couldn't agree with Councilor Baez more. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5428.842s">I'm</a>  very glad to see the property owner and the historic commission sitting down trying to make compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5434.449s">We</a>  have ample opportunity and time to still address this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5439.416s">We</a>  have another meeting before the deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5442.598s">I'd</a>  ask that the matter be tabled to a date certain to allow the homeowner and the historical commission to continue their deliberations and discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5449.343s">But</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, we do have, I believe, representatives here from the owner that have been working on a plan or are ready to make some commitments to a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5459.59s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that the property owner be given an opportunity to speak.</p>

    <p>[Goldschneider]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5494.296s">I</a>  want to express my appreciation to the City Council and the various other people that attended the Committee of the Whole yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5504.718s">I</a>  think we're close on a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5507.619s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Marks for brokering or helping broker a potential negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5520.305s">between</a>  the two parties here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5523.726s">Adam's</a>  gonna speak a bit more to what we are proposing, but just in short, we plan on incorporating, you know what, I'm gonna let Adam talk to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5540.192s">He's</a>  gonna be able to talk to it much more eloquently than I am, so Adam, why don't you go ahead.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5545.393s">Okay,</a>  we've got, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5554.943s">I</a>  think everyone realizes during construction that these elements will not preserved in their current state. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5562.147s">But</a>  we can <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5577.216s">that</a>  we're going to be presenting a rendering next hearing on</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5595.094s">and</a>  members of the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5597.076s">Thank</a>  you so much for letting us come back and we really appreciate you coming out to the site and taking a look at the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5604.221s">I</a>  think you get a much better sense of what we have there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5609.304s">And</a>  while <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5610.985s">the</a>  existing building is not practical for reuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5614.989s">And</a>  we had talked about being able to, whether or not you could just save the facade itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5621.234s">And</a>  from what our engineer and the building inspector confirmed, you can't remove the facade without the whole building collapsing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5629.921s">What</a>  we have been able to do with the input from the city council and from the historical commission is <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5637.127s">to</a>  incorporate certain aspects, architectural conditions from the front of the building, which will be now incorporated into the plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5647.192s">We</a>  just had the on-site meeting yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5649.493s">As</a>  you know, our architect, Adam Muir, is working on the plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5653.275s">We</a>  don't have them for you yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5655.676s">But</a>  we are eager to work with you and with the commission to try to incorporate some of those concepts into the new plan so we can continue to have some of that <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5670.245s">the</a>  reference back to the past into the new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5673.306s">We</a>  would hope to have these to you, and Adam, correct me if I'm wrong, sometime before the meeting on October 6th, so you can have those, and then we can talk with both the Historical Commission and you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5689.872s">The</a>  idea would be <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5692.414s">being</a>  able to reach some sort of agreement on these plans and have our good faith to work on those going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5701.181s">And</a>  then the request would be, of course, to have the second amendment to the revised ordinances to adopt the single lot historic district, to have that withdrawn once we come forward with revised plans.</p>

    <p>[Goldschneider]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5718.004s">I'm</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5718.404s">architectural</a>  elements are</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5748.015s">Council,</a>  actually, do you want to speak out tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5752.54s">We</a>  have a couple of councils with the hits.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_39]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5754.423s">I</a>  got a question if you're ready to give it to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5756.084s">I</a>  have no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5758.507s">Council</a>  appears.</p>

    <p>[Goldschneider]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5787.957s">Absolutely,</a>  Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5790.217s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5790.917s">Thank</a>  you, Ari.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5826.118s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5827.779s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5834.003s">Okay,</a>  Councilor Marks and then Councilor Caviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5836.324s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5837.805s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5839.366s">I</a>  just want to thank members of the historic commission that were present there last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5845.49s">I</a>  want to thank the property owner and, Mr. President, I do want to thank this Meffitt City Council that took the time, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5856.095s">when</a>  it didn't look that anything was going to result in this property. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5861.7s">And</a>  I think we're that much closer to coming to a win-win situation on both sides, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5868.886s">And</a>  I want to thank the members of this council that stood up to say, you know what, we'd like to go on a site visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5874.971s">We'd</a>  like to hear from the property owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5877.981s">We'd</a>  like to come to a resolve, because we all support the same issues behind this rail, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5884.704s">Don't</a>  let anyone kid you otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5887.064s">We</a>  all support it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5889.285s">And</a>  it was because of the due diligence of this council standing up and saying that we believe we can make a difference, that I hope this comes to fruition, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5900.469s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5904.79s">Councilor</a>  Caviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5906.311s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5907.031s">I</a>  want to reiterate Councilor Marks' comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5911.293s">I</a>  mean, after all this time waiting, and then all of a sudden on the last hour, we were able to convene and sit with the owners and the commission, everybody, and hopefully <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5925.958s">I</a>  think we agreed last night that they would provide a rendering to make the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5932.262s">Because</a>  again, we only met last night, and I think it would have been hard for them to be able to accomplish something in one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5938.246s">And</a>  I think we all agreed to wait until next week before we made a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5944.71s">But</a>  Councilor Baxter's right, we all worked hard here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5947.212s">We</a>  came together as a group and as all the commissions to hopefully come off <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5954.116s">to</a>  come up with something gamical to make all parties happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5957.417s">So</a>  I want to thank everybody involved for all their work.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5961.559s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Carbielo. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5964.761s">Let's</a>  see, we have Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5967.302s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5968.082s">Again,</a>  just to reiterate, I think that for what the Historical Commission has in front of them, it's a daunting task when you look at our community and its historical values. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5977.966s">And</a>  we all, like Councilman Mark said, I think all of us <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5982.749s">And</a>  I think that the situation that we were put in with this situation had a lot to do with maybe the COVID and the opportunity for both parties to meet in a mutual and respectful manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5996.378s">I</a>  think both the commission and the homeowner were great. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5999.56s">We</a>  appreciate the opportunity to walk through the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6003.823s">That</a>  piece was glaring, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6005.905s">What's</a>  important to me is to sit in front of a home, not behind these chambers, but with the people involved, all in front of each other, face to face. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6014.132s">And</a>  it was something as simple as Council Marks' experience by working on this council for many, many years to just bring up a topic that maybe both parties can speak on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6029.508s">And</a>  this is what we're seeing, we're seeing the best of the worst case scenario avoided. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6035.791s">So</a>  again, I applaud my colleagues and both the historical commission and the homeowner to reach an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6044.495s">Because</a>  we've seen our share of greeted developers in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6050.117s">And</a>  I think this homeowner was very open and honest with us and <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6059.961s">And</a>  we'll work now with our commission to make sure that we are going to keep as much as the historical preservation that we can on that site. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6071.568s">So</a>  again, I thank my colleagues and I believe that's a good example of good government. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6076.691s">So</a>  again, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6078.793s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scott Kelly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6080.534s">And</a>  I want to, Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6084.653s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and I want to echo Councilor Marks and my colleagues' comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6089.214s">And</a>  I also want to say that I think this shows the efficacy of the demo delay and the potential historic district as a tool to ensure that we can have a negotiation and reach a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6098.897s">I</a>  think in many cases in this community with developers, we don't really have much community leverage, and in this case we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6106.819s">And</a>  I think it's allowed us to meet all of the different pieces of this, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6111.963s">It's</a>  allowed us to really make sure that development can happen, that housing units can be built, which I think we all agree that, you know, in an apartment district, it makes sense to have, on a lot of that size, it makes sense to have units, while also maintaining historical preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6125.833s">So</a>  I just want to say I think it actually shows that, you know, if we didn't have demo delay and we didn't have this historic district proposal, we would just, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6134.759s">have</a>  another building of apartments and not something that preserves and kind of highlights the history of shipbuilding in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6141.964s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6143.645s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Pierce. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6144.725s">And</a>  if I may, I want to thank everyone that was involved in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6148.508s">I</a>  know, you know, I think it was beneficial to go out to the site to actually have a walk through the property and both inside and outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6158.354s">That's</a>  always beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6160.135s">And</a>  I'd like to thank everyone for their involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6163.956s">But</a>  we do have a little bit of an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6166.917s">I</a>  did talk to the city solicitor today, and that window is getting smaller and smaller as to what we need to do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6175.379s">With</a>  regard to the vote that we're supposed to take tonight, it's supposed to be should this be a historical district, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6183.822s">And</a>  so tonight would technically be the first reading of this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6188.143s">So-</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_39]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6190.453s">I'm</a>  sorry, provided it passes.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6192.694s">You</a>  are correct.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6195.435s">But</a>  if, okay.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6203.098s">So</a>  if I want to make sure we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6206.36s">So,</a>  so, and I thank you for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6208.801s">So</a>  if it passes, it would be its first reading and then it would go to the paper for its, so actually yeah, then it would go to the paper for its second reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6217.524s">So</a>  therefore if we didn't vote tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6221.479s">What's</a>  going to happen is, the next meeting is October 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6226.14s">And</a>  therefore, the second reading wouldn't get into the paper after the demo delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6232.321s">Point</a>  of information, demo delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6234.262s">So</a>  from what I've been told, we need to make a vote tonight on whether this is actually going to be historic district or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6243.104s">And</a>  then when it comes back to the third reading, if something changes, then we can go from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6247.664s">But</a>  I think that- We don't receive this information.</p>

    <p>[Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6250.566s">And</a>  told by whom?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6251.487s">I</a>  just called today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6252.629s">I</a>  made this call at 5 o'clock this afternoon, literally right before I came to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6261.722s">Because</a>  I like to get all, I like to make sure that, you know what, when this happens, I, you know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6268.208s">Is</a>  the city solicitor available as requested by the president from the meeting yesterday?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6272.05s">I</a>  asked the city solicitor if she was available tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6274.951s">She</a>  said no. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6276.012s">She</a>  was busy, but we can try giving her a call if you like, if you want to take a brief recess.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6282.394s">I'm</a>  just looking at the committee report from last night where President Falco said that the council needs the city solicitor present. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6288.797s">And</a>  then the next sentence says Mr. Howard suggested holding off on a historic district.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_41]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6292.987s">So</a>  that's what I'm referring to is the conversation we had last night.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6295.969s">And</a>  I asked the city solicitor today if she could be present tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6299.071s">She</a>  said she could not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6300.492s">But</a>  we can try giving her a call if you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6302.133s">We</a>  can take a brief recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6303.553s">I</a>  can try getting her on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6305.675s">Is</a>  that what the council would like to do?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6309.597s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6310.518s">But</a>  with all due respect, Mr. President, I had a conversation with the solicitor as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6314.64s">And</a>  from what the solicitor told me in my conversation with her was that <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6319.673s">The</a>  issuance of the demolition permit is told when the paper is advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6328.256s">So</a>  it doesn't matter if 18 months pass after the paper is advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6332.898s">And</a>  there's case law on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6334.578s">And</a>  she and I spoke about it at length today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6337.099s">I</a>  did too. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6338.52s">So</a>  I'm not sure if the information that you're getting from her and the information that I'm getting from her are the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6344.122s">But</a>  I'm pretty confident in the conversation that I had with her where she said, you're absolutely right, Adam. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6348.423s">I</a>  don't know why this is so hard to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6351.348s">First</a>  reading happens, then it gets advertised, and then advertisement controls. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6355.175s">If</a>  advertisement goes out, the demolition permit can't get issued, regardless of whether or not October 8th comes and goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6362.603s">So</a>  second reading is the advertisement. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6366.705s">And</a>  that is what tolls the demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6369.307s">And</a>  we can toll the demolition delay on October 7th if need be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6372.728s">So</a>  I don't understand the need to take this to a vote right now when you yourself had suggested that the city solicitor needs to be present in order for us to make this vote properly, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6381.373s">And</a>  number two, when the representative of the historic commission who was with us at the meeting suggested we hold off on it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6387.576s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6388.885s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Beers.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6390.746s">Would</a>  the second reading be able to be published on October 7th? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6395.128s">What</a>  is the print deadline for the Medford transcript? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6398.41s">Why</a>  does it have to be in the transcript? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6399.831s">The</a>  Globe runs every day.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_41]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6400.811s">The</a>  Herald runs every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6402.192s">The</a>  Globe costs $1,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6403.973s">Pay</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6405.174s">The</a>  House is so important.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6406.074s">Why</a>  don't we want to spend the money to advertise for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6408.595s">I</a>  mean, more people read the Globe than the transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6410.276s">I</a>  can't tell you a person that ever bought the Medford transcript in the last 15 years.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_41]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6413.018s">I</a>  don't know one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6414.118s">I</a>  buy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6414.639s">I</a>  get it every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6416.159s">God</a>  bless you.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6416.74s">I</a>  know two.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_41]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6417.906s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6429.652s">Your</a>  suggested kind of solution was we could do first reading, second reading, and then if something changes by third, we still have that option to- It's still a third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6438.439s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6438.879s">We</a>  still have the option to change should the compromise be met and things are satisfied.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6442.782s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6443.123s">I</a>  mean, if you go to the point of the compromise, I mean, have any plans been brought to the building commissioner? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6449.327s">Has</a>  the building commissioner seen anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6450.708s">I</a>  would assume he would have to see that as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_41]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6452.129s">Between</a>  7 o'clock last night and this morning?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6453.71s">I</a>  mean- <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6454.551s">I</a>  understand that, but you know what, the way I look at it too, it's not our fault we're in this jam right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6458.352s">I</a>  mean, here we are down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6460.332s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6460.912s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6465.173s">One</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6467.434s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6469.534s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6470.555s">And</a>  I appreciate both sides on this, believe me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6473.335s">But</a>  after last night's meeting, I think we'd be doing this whole process an injustice to keep on moving the goal pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6482.557s">If</a>  we keep on moving it, we got a commitment last night to move forward based on what was stated last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6489.949s">And</a>  that was clear to me, what was stated last night, that we were going to work to maintain the front facade. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6497.037s">And</a>  we were not going to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6498.858s">This</a>  is right out of Ryan Hayward's mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6501.379s">And</a>  I think I asked him the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6503.14s">And</a>  he said, absolutely, we would wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6505.14s">He</a>  said, we may do it at a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6506.821s">I</a>  remember him saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6508.682s">We</a>  may do it down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6510.563s">I</a>  can't promise you we won't revisit it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6512.683s">But</a>  at this point, if we're able to move this forward, like we did last night, that we weren't going to move that issue forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6519.526s">So</a>  now we're hearing that you want to move it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6521.627s">Because</a>  even though it's the first reading, it's still moving the issue forward, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6526.529s">However</a>  you slice that pie, it's still moving it forward, and that flies in the face of what we agreed upon in good faith last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6534.332s">So</a>  I don't think we can keep on moving the goal post here and think we're going to come out with a resolve if we're going to change the game as this goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6542.874s">That's</a>  all I say, and I don't think that represents either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6546.615s">I</a>  think that's just common sense in negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6550.177s">If</a>  you don't stick by a negotiation, it's not going to end up working.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6555.118s">And</a>  I appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6556.079s">I'm</a>  not saying it has anything to do with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6558.96s">But</a>  what I'm saying is I don't think we should change it at this particular point.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6563.182s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6564.962s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6565.903s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Beers.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6567.203s">I</a>  just got a message from Ryan Hayward that they have approved the cost to run it in the Herald or Globe if needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6572.526s">So</a>  I'm comfortable tabling until the 6th.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_41]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6576.648s">I'm</a>  glad Ryan gave you approval.</p>

    <p>[Goldschneider]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6580.889s">President,</a>  can I speak, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6582.91s">Yes,</a>  Mr. Goldschneider, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6585.326s">I</a>  think we had a very productive discussion last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6589.53s">A</a>  lot of issues were flushed out in person and we came to, I'll just call it like a business arrangement with the local historic commission, local historic district commission, an arrangement, an agreement in principle that in return for <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6615.82s">to</a>  incorporate certain items, architectural items from the existing home into the new design. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6624.906s">And</a>  now what Councilor Beals brought up with regard to the historical market, including those two items, it was my understanding based on the dialogue last night, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6637.475s">that</a>  moving forward with the historic district would not continue pending the review of the plans on October 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6648.242s">So</a>  this has sort of surprised me, because I thought that we had agreed to something in principle and now things are sort of changing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6657.168s">I</a>  wasn't prepared.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6658.809s">The</a>  only thing I was doing was giving the council information that I got. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6664.613s">That's</a>  all I was doing, okay?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6669.637s">I</a>  second Councilor Knight's motion to table.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6672.019s">So</a>  there is a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6674.0s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6675.261s">Mr.</a>  President, before we table the matter, there is a committee of the whole report that's before us that's going to have to get put into the agenda for next week's meeting for us to vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6684.628s">But</a>  last night at the site visit, we did vote on a motion to ask a question of the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6692.316s">And</a>  that question that we asked to the city solicitor was, can this process constitute a regulatory taking, opening up the city to financial or other liabilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6701.062s">And</a>  I'd like to offer that question to the city solicitor as a B paper this evening, so that we can get that to her for an answer as well before next week.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6708.548s">Okay,</a>  so we'll take the B paper first. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6710.889s">Clerk</a>  Harnaby, do you have the wording in the B paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6713.131s">Clerk</a>  Harnaby, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6722.715s">I</a>  have the first part. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6724.576s">Can</a>  this process be considered regulatory taking?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6728.158s">Opening</a>  the city up to financial or other liabilities.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6734.081s">Financial</a>  or other liabilities.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6740.685s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6742.606s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6742.926s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6746.508s">On</a>  that motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6751.923s">Vice</a>  President Cabrillo, Clerk Hunter, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6754.224s">This</a>  is on the B paper.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7019.465s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7020.766s">I'm</a>  incredibly glad to see this item before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7023.287s">I</a>  think charter reviews are long overdue in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7025.829s">I</a>  think this charter was last reviewed before I was born. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7028.271s">And</a>  empowering this council and ensuring greater representation and diversity on the council are one of the many ways I hope, one of the many changes I hope the Charter Commission would explore. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7038.717s">I</a>  do have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7040.439s">I'm</a>  not sure if a representative of the city administration will be able to answer it or who we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7046.242s">We</a>  have Jackie Peeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7047.863s">I'm</a>  not sure if Jackie has this information off the top of her head. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7051.004s">And</a>  maybe my colleagues, I'm especially thinking Councilor Knight might have the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7056.606s">If</a>  this were approved tonight, would it be disposed of by the legislature at the end of this session in December? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7063.009s">And</a>  would a new home rule petition have to be sent after the new general court session begins in January?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7068.751s">Okay,</a>  thank you, Councilor Beers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7070.932s">We</a>  have Jackie Peeks, who is representing the administration tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7073.973s">Jackie.</a> </p>

    <p>[Peeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7076.821s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor, for that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7078.543s">I</a>  do not know off the top of my head, but I will certainly find out and report back to the council.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7085.188s">I</a>  think Councilor Knight might have said yes.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7087.71s">Mr.</a>  President, if the legislation doesn't pass by the close of the end of the legislative session, then the bill needs to be reintroduced for the next legislative session. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7095.636s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7096.757s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7097.377s">The</a>  question would come as to whether or not we need to pass another home rule petition to reintroduce the bill in the next legislative session. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7102.902s">And</a>  that I can't answer.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7104.923s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7110.036s">Thank</a>  you, Jackie. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7112.196s">Councilor</a>  Knight, I'm sorry, did you have a question?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_39]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7116.317s">Is</a>  that a question you'd like to ask the solicitor?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7123.119s">Yeah,</a>  I would be happy to ask the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7125.6s">I'll</a>  ask on my own, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7129.721s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Pierce. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7131.662s">Any</a>  other questions from the council on this?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7137.912s">Councilor</a>  Layton.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7138.832s">I,</a>  for one, will not be supporting this paper this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7141.333s">We're</a>  in the middle of a global pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7143.153s">We</a>  had a meeting for two hours today talking about how we're unable to conduct regular city council business right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7149.635s">One</a>  out of five adults in Massachusetts are unemployed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7152.196s">We</a>  have a 20% unemployment rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7153.816s">We're</a>  seeing the worst economic time since the Great Depression. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7158.137s">People</a>  are restricted in their ability to get about the community, to speak with people, to talk to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7162.098s">It's</a>  going to impact the ability to run a grassroots campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7164.819s">and</a>  inform the residents in this community what's going on, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7168.281s">Number</a>  two, in times of uncertainty, we need stability. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7172.663s">In</a>  times of uncertainty, we need stability. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7174.524s">We</a>  should be focusing on getting our kids back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7176.425s">We</a>  should be focusing on getting our economy locally back up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7179.346s">I</a>  think that's what our priority should be right now during this global pandemic, things that actually make the community and the city run, the services that we deliver. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7186.73s">You</a>  know, I've stated and I've been opposed to this process in the past, doing it with the homework petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7190.792s">I</a>  feel as though this is something that should come from the voters, that should come from the ground up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7194.113s">And</a>  now is not the time to promote a ground up effort when the activities of people are so hamstrung. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7200.559s">And</a>  where our government is operating under such stringent restrictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7204.783s">So</a>  for those reasons, I'll be voting against the paper this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7207.405s">I</a>  rest my case.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7208.466s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7211.489s">Any</a>  other councilors want to speak on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7213.771s">Yes,</a>  so we have a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7215.232s">Okay,</a>  let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7217.174s">We'll</a>  go with Councilor Marks and then Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7219.776s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7221.736s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my colleague, Counselor Knight, for his comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7228.121s">This</a>  indeed is a very difficult time to move forward on such a large endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7235.307s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7237.077s">It</a>  was back in February of 2016 when I offered the original home rule petition, which I believe some members of the council were on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7247.405s">It</a>  reads a little different from what the mayor is offering. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7251.108s">At</a>  the time, we were looking at a seven member commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7257.013s">We</a>  also outlined when a final report would be back with recommendations, which at the time we thought was <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7265.72s">key</a>  component to moving this along, because if you leave it open ended, the process inherently is a long process to start off with. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7275.924s">When</a>  we reviewed this back in 2016, February 2016, we were looking at potential ballot questions in 2019 or 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7289.636s">So</a>  that shows you it's at least a two to three year process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7295.581s">Built</a>  into that number is at the time what we established was an 18 month review process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7304.409s">So</a>  once you establish a commission, then they had roughly 18 months to go through a charter that hasn't been reviewed in 34 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7315.413s">A</a>  charter that's only been changed over the last 34 years, ironically, to give increases to the mayor's salary, which is under the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7327.083s">And</a>  that's the only really review that's been looked at when it comes to charter review in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7334.37s">The</a>  charter is the constitution that governs our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7338.734s">It's</a>  a vital document that I'd say most people in the community are unaware of because, let's be quite frank, we haven't reviewed it in 34 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7347.864s">There</a>  hasn't been much discussion and people are just not aware of what the charter defines. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7354.791s">And</a>  there's a number of issues within the charter or responsibilities and powers that define how government operates, the length of terms, the duties and powers and responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7369.918s">And</a>  it is extremely vital, even during a pandemic, that we focus on a charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7378.923s">And</a>  I, as one member of the council, think there's no better time than the present <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7384.369s">to</a>  start the ball rolling and take a look at what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7390.892s">And</a>  this is not putting a stamp of approval saying that things will be changed in the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7397.055s">We're</a>  asking for a charter commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7399.857s">The</a>  commission may sit down and look at the charter and say, wow, you guys created a perfect charter 34 years ago, and we don't think anything needs to be done to this charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7410.182s">I</a>  don't think that's going to be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7412.756s">But</a>  that could happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7414.717s">So</a>  this is not saying the charter's going to be changed in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7418.278s">It's</a>  just saying, let's create a review process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7421.879s">Many</a>  charters that, if you look at cities and towns, they have a built-in periodic review of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7430.743s">When</a>  ours was created some 34 years ago, there was no built-in review. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7436.045s">Hence</a>  why we're at a point now that the charter's never been reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7441.963s">So</a>  when I offered the resolution back in 2016, the home rule petition, one of the recommendations that was part of that petition was that at a minimum, an amendment be present in the city charter instituting an appointed committee to conduct a periodic review of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7464.335s">So</a>  at a minimum, whatever happened, if there were no change at all, then at least we know going forward, and I agree with this 1,000%, I don't know where my colleagues stand, that this charter should be reviewed every so often. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7476.863s">Whether</a>  it's yearly, whether it's every few years, whatever it might be, it needs to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7482.586s">If</a>  you had a business plan from 35 years ago, you would be out of business right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7487.651s">And</a>  the charter is no different, it's a business plan how we operate a community and how we run a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7494.953s">And</a>  so I think it's very important that we move forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7499.654s">If</a>  it does calling for a refiling next year, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7504.875s">So</a>  be it, we refile it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7507.036s">When</a>  we filed this back in 2016, it was a four to three vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7513.408s">It</a>  passed four to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7516.309s">We</a>  sent it to the state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7518.729s">Many</a>  of us that were supportive of this back in 2016 followed through the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7525.451s">Unfortunately,</a>  the process did not exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7528.872s">The</a>  chairman of the committee, and his name escapes me right now, decided on his own, Mr. President, because I talked to him back in 2016, decided on his own not to give this a hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7544.332s">And</a>  I asked, why would you not give a petition that's before you, a home rule petition that's crafted by a city saying the city wants it, the representatives, the forefathers of the city said, we want this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7557.372s">And</a>  his answer to me, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7560.819s">was</a>  that I don't believe that the four to three vote was a majority of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7567.968s">It</a>  didn't represent a majority of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7571.833s">And</a>  I question saying a four to three vote is a majority of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7576.559s">And</a>  it's no difference when you vote as a state legislator that a majority wins, a majority rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7583.281s">And</a>  at the time, he just disagreed and didn't give it the proper hearing that it should have received, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7589.804s">So</a>  I'm hoping this time, and I know there's some members that are hesitant with this, Mr. President, but I would respectfully ask my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7598.547s">that</a>  allow this to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7601.591s">This</a>  is the first step in many steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7605.156s">This</a>  is a two to three year process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7608.38s">This</a>  is not going to happen overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7610.382s">And</a>  I'm hoping as we move forward, Mr. President, that the pandemic will be behind us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7615.984s">That's</a>  how long this process is going to take, and I'm hoping that's behind us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7620.308s">So</a>  regarding the signatures that are required, I believe it's 15% of the number of registered voters that you have in the community to put it on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7636.069s">We've</a>  had people of the community for the last several years, some good people that have walked around, knocked doors, stood in front of stores, got thousands of signatures, still fell short of the mark of the 15% that's required, Mr. President, but did yeoman's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7654.673s">And</a>  I believe there's enough support out there in the community to move this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7659.194s">Why</a>  not assist, if we can, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7661.895s">As</a>  legislators for this city, why not assist in moving the process forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7670.503s">Not</a>  disregarding a process, the signatures is one process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7674.086s">A</a>  home rule petition is another process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7677.469s">There's</a>  more ways than one to skin a cat. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7680.532s">We're</a>  skinning a cat a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7682.734s">We're</a>  going to the legislative home rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7686.721s">It's</a>  long overdue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7688.823s">I</a>  appreciate there's a lot of opinions on this, and it hasn't been looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7692.966s">And</a>  some people may see this as a struggle for power, some people may see it all different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7700.292s">I</a>  see it, Mr. President, as good government in reviewing a document that really requires review in this day and age. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7708.258s">The</a>  city has changed in the last 35 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7712.526s">And</a>  we should change with the times as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7715.189s">So</a>  I respectfully ask my colleagues to take a long look at this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7720.334s">I</a>  will be supporting this tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7723.217s">Like</a>  I said, to move the first step forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7725.74s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7728.578s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7730.059s">Echoing</a>  a lot of what's been said already, this is something that is long overdue, and I thank the administration for introducing this, highlighting the fact that, as Councilor Mark said, this is, it's a review, it's just that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7741.804s">It's</a>  a long process that I think we absolutely need to start as soon as possible, and every election since I've lived in Medford, this has been an issue, and I think we owe it to the citizens of this city to move forward in good faith to do <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7754.17s">just</a>  what this is, which is review to look at what we're operating on, and I support this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7759.792s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7760.252s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7761.252s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7762.073s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7764.473s">Like</a>  Councilor Mock said, I too supported this in 2016, but I will tell you, I think that because the process does take the time that it will take, unfortunately, this isn't something that this council created or this council <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7781.059s">This</a>  council delayed, I think I was one of the four councils voted for that in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7785.182s">But</a>  I think Councilor Knight brings up a very important point that we started our subcommittee meeting with. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7791.346s">There's</a>  so much going on right now in our community that we, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7796.91s">The</a>  focus has to be on the bigger things in our community right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7800.814s">This</a>  is something that needs to be done down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7803.376s">I</a>  think that hopefully as you see things turn and people are back in this chamber and we get to move things forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7810.523s">Kids</a>  are back in school and city business is done a little bit differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7815.067s">I</a>  think that I'll go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7817.089s">But</a>  as of tonight, I think there are too many variables and too many issues that our city is dealing with right now to even spend a minute focused on charter review, considering that, like I said, it is a two to three year process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7830.92s">And</a>  right now, I think we need to focus on <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7835.805s">issues</a>  that are in front of us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7837.266s">So,</a>  again, I thank both Councilor Marks and Councilor Nights viewpoints on both, but I will not be supporting this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7846.713s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7847.153s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scott Kelly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7848.414s">Vice</a>  President Carviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7849.835s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7850.556s">Mr.</a>  President, I was part of the council when this came up the last time, and I did not support it back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7859.563s">Councilor</a>  Marks made some <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7861.604s">Very</a>  good points there, and I do agree with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7864.205s">But</a>  I also agree with Councilor Knight that right now is really not the time for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7869.027s">We've</a>  got many other things happening in the city that are much more important than this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7875.535s">And</a>  I think once the kids are back in school and we're back and doing regular business here, this would be something I could support. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7883.821s">But</a>  at this particular time, I can't support it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7888.184s">Just</a>  because, as I said, we've got way too many things happening in this city and other business needs to be done at this particular time, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7896.83s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Caviello.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7898.231s">Mr.</a>  President, motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7901.734s">Council</a>  members?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7904.201s">Motion</a>  to approve.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7905.042s">Okay,</a>  on the motion of Councilor Bears, seconded by- Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7909.566s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7911.488s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7915.551s">Yes,</a>  let me do that, one minute.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7919.435s">Councilor</a>  Marks, there you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7921.937s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and I don't like to dwell on the past, but knowing what happened in 2016, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7929.195s">And</a>  I'm not sure if that representative is still even the chairman of that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7932.899s">I</a>  don't know if it was the committee on local affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7936.183s">I</a>  can't even remember the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7939.727s">Maybe</a>  election laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7941.349s">John</a>  Rogers, is that something? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7942.97s">Maybe</a>  it was Representative Rogers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7946.674s">I</a>  can't recall, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7948.476s">I</a>  got a lot of. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7950.126s">Useful</a>  information stuck in my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7953.928s">Useless</a>  information stuck in my head, but that's not one of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7956.89s">But</a>  I would just ask, Mr. President, respectfully that I would hate to pass something that is going to be on the same wave as we did in 2016 and then only go up to the State House and them say that it doesn't have the support of the city because of the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7978.204s">or</a>  the sheer number of votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7981.127s">So</a>  I can see what my colleagues are stating, that this may not be the best time, but if we looked at maybe the beginning of the next fiscal year, January, does that sound like a time that <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7998.373s">would</a>  be amendable to other members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8000.634s">I</a>  don't know if it's strictly just the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8002.555s">They</a>  may have other philosophical differences with charter review and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8007.418s">But</a>  if that's the case, I wouldn't mind holding off until January, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8013.701s">Especially</a>  if this did happen to go down tonight, we couldn't bring it up again for what, 90 days? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8020.098s">So</a>  you're looking at that time frame anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8023.86s">I'm</a>  prepared to vote on it tonight, but I just would hate to see this go down the same way, because I really believe in it strongly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8031.905s">So</a>  I just want to throw that out to my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8034.367s">If</a>  there is support, maybe not this particular second, but maybe in January, is that workable? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8042.772s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8043.632s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8046.328s">I</a>  think that there's areas to agree and disagree, but this is something we agree on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8051.71s">Unfortunately,</a>  what we don't agree on is a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8054.371s">I</a>  think that as one council who voted for this in the past, and knowing that it's something that needs to be done, like our zoning and many other things, historical issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8065.675s">So</a>  I think that this is important, but I think right now, I think there's so much that supersedes it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8070.497s">That</a>  if it is offered sometime in the next fiscal year, it'll be something that I will totally <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8075.899s">support</a>  again, so I thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8079.242s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scott Kelly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8082.205s">Councilor</a>  Beers.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8083.686s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8085.027s">And</a>  I hear what people are saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8086.189s">I</a>  just think this is the part where it's not, we're not, the city of Benford is not focused on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8090.573s">This</a>  is, we're asking the permission from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8092.755s">We've</a>  known how long it can take on a variety of home rule petitions that this council has sent in the past that have never been heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8098.8s">I</a>  think we are advantaged by sending it sooner rather than later, trying to get the legislature to move on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8105.705s">Because</a>  I think if we send it, I'll vote for it now, I'll vote for it in January, I'll vote for it whenever it's on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8112.15s">But</a>  if we send it in January, it could be the next January before they act on it, or they may never act on it at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8118.575s">So</a>  I just think if we're talking about time, this is the part of the process where it's not, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8125.649s">in</a>  the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8126.77s">It's</a>  in the general court asking for the home rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8131.412s">So</a>  I just think getting it up there sooner rather than later to try to move it along, it doesn't mean that this council can't focus on the many other issues that we have at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8141.436s">So</a>  that's just where I'm at. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8143.838s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8145.238s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Pierce. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8146.259s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8148.165s">I</a>  do think it's also important to point out, for those that are so supportive of the measure, that if it goes forward tonight, you get two bites at the apple. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8156.531s">because</a>  if it doesn't pass by January, then it gets refiled again. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8159.654s">And</a>  if it does get passed before January, then you get charter commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8163.516s">But</a>  I don't support the paper, but from an operational standpoint, if it got held until the end of the year or <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8171.983s">or</a>  tabled or whatever it may be, and it can't come back up for 90 days, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8176.047s">The</a>  next session's in session. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8177.349s">So</a>  you can send the paper to legislation now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8179.411s">If</a>  it doesn't get taken up for a vote, it doesn't get taken up for a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8181.713s">Then</a>  you want to do it again in January anyway when the circumstances change, you get another bite at the apple with a new legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8187.599s">So</a>  that's something to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8188.76s">But</a>  either way, I'm not going to support it this evening.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8190.983s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8191.183s">Well,</a>  Mr. President, if I may.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8193.145s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Ike.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8194.606s">And</a>  I think that that's kind of the point I'm trying to make, is let's send it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8197.327s">If</a>  they approve it, they approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8198.767s">If</a>  we send it up now in this session, and if not, we're back in January, and then they can approve it in the new session. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8204.409s">I</a>  just think we know exactly how difficult it is for the municipalities, whether it's Medford or most other municipalities, to get a home rule petition passed through the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8214.052s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8215.432s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8216.413s">We</a>  have a number of people that want to speak on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8218.373s">So</a>  at this point, I'm going to call on Matt H. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8224.52s">Name</a>  and address for the record, Matt.</p>

    <p>[Hughes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8227.363s">Hey,</a>  y'all. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8227.843s">Yeah,</a>  my name is Matt Hughes, 76 Boston Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8232.068s">I</a>  would absolutely like to speak in favor of, oh, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8235.932s">Can</a>  y'all hear me?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8238.595s">Matt,</a>  you said your last name's Hughes, right?</p>

    <p>[Hughes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8241.097s">Hughes,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8242.519s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Hughes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8243.059s">No</a>  problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8247.574s">So</a>  I am in favor of charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8249.855s">I</a>  have collected signatures in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8252.075s">Folks</a>  have mentioned this is something that many members of the community across a lot of different political stripes, to be perfectly honest, have done work to try and get our city into better shape with respect to our foundational documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8271.741s">being</a>  reviewed, ideally getting back into a position where that document can be reviewed on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8278.587s">That</a>  would be super great. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8280.368s">Additionally,</a>  I think that I'm really glad that the mayor introduced this at this moment, because I think that this is an urgent moment to address very specific and concrete issues regarding the issues of race in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8297.663s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8298.644s">There</a>  are many, many things that could come out of a process, but I know that one that there's going to be a lot of appetite from the community for is of ward representation in how we elect to the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8314.766s">And</a>  that <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8316.933s">board</a>  representation could result in a lot more opportunity for West Medford to be diversely represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8324.979s">So</a>  that- Point of information, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8326.741s">That</a>  is- Matt, one minute please. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8327.862s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8332.805s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8336.544s">Councilman.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8337.365s">I</a>  just want to clarify that the gentleman said regarding what representation and how we elect the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8343.528s">There's</a>  also an elected board called the school committee, and they are elected the same way as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8347.931s">So</a>  I think when we talk about charter review, we have to be careful not to just isolate certain groups, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8355.836s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8356.236s">You</a>  are correct, Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8358.337s">Matt,</a>  please continue.</p>

    <p>[Hughes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8361.179s">Yes,</a>  I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8363.157s">In</a>  any event, I think that the prospect that Councilor Knight brought up, the prospect that it should be done via grassroots means, especially during the pandemic, seems very counterproductive to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8377.149s">I</a>  think that our community has actually banded together and there is a lot of volunteer activity being directed towards the public good right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8385.456s">And</a>  I think that if we want to maintain focus on what our, what folks should be, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8391.741s">I</a>  think it's a waste of our time and people actually need</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8421.8s">Thank</a>  you, Matt. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8422.24s">Let's</a>  see, we have Jess Farrell. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8425.844s">Jess,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8485.195s">Thank</a>  you, Jess. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8486.096s">Let's</a>  see, Will Navar. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8490.338s">Will,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Navar]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8493.407s">I'm</a>  excited to learn about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8522.622s">backlog</a>  of changes that need to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8526.423s">The</a>  sooner you get started, the easier it'll be to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8530.064s">That</a>  doesn't mean it'll be easy, but let's not kick the can down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8533.845s">It's</a>  just a good governance thing, just like council first.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8536.446s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9010.812s">I</a>  just want to double check to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9011.953s">Oh,</a>  we got Max Heineck. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9013.113s">Let's</a>  see, Max. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9015.874s">Max,</a>  I'm trying to unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9017.715s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Heineck]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9020.176s">My</a>  name is Max Heineck. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9021.396s">I</a>  live with 5 Alden Road in Bedford, and I'm in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9026.27s">I'm</a>  the co-owner of Medford Brewing Company, and we would love the opportunity for ourselves or for other local breweries to come and be a part of the city and to create a gathering spot for Medfordians and to do so in a way that would bring new business, prosperity, peace, and joy to the neighborhoods.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9050.785s">Thank</a>  you, Max. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9055.851s">Okay,</a>  let's see, anyone else in favor of the petition that would like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9059.974s">Okay,</a>  hearing and seeing none, hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9073.702s">Anyone</a>  opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9075.223s">Is</a>  there anyone in opposition to the petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9078.325s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9086.496s">Clerk</a>  Urtubez, I don't see anyone here in opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9095.127s">Hearing</a>  and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9097.711s">Would</a>  anyone in the council like to discuss, Councilor Marks, do you have your? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9105.39s">Was</a>  that from the last time? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9106.37s">Your</a>  microphone's on, I didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9108.131s">Yeah,</a>  I think it was from last time, but I would like to speak, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9110.932s">Yeah,</a>  one second, let me just, Councilor Marks, and then we have Councilor Knight after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9115.274s">Councilor</a>  Marks!</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9117.755s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and the letter we received from the Community Development Board with their recommendation, I thought was already part of our brewery ordinance when we talked about the serving of food <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9134.421s">And</a>  the ability to produce on site or bring in food from off site. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9140.743s">And</a>  also have food trucks on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9144.764s">I</a>  thought that was language we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9146.545s">If</a>  it's not in there for some reason, I know this went back and forth with attorneys and <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9151.406s">Back</a>  and forth with the council, I strongly support adding the language that was recommended by the Community Development Board after the definition of brewery that states the facility may also provide food that is produced on site, produced off site, or produced with food trucks that are located on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9172.159s">So</a>  I would ask that that be part of the ordinance, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9175.542s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9175.982s">Okay,</a>  so on the-</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9181.406s">So</a>  is your motion to adopt with the amendments? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9186.129s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9186.75s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9187.91s">Clerk,</a>  do you have the language of the amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9191.192s">Well,</a>  basically to adopt the changes recommended by the city board, am I correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9194.695s">To</a>  adopt the changes recommended by the city board.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9196.776s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9198.277s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9198.477s">So</a>  that is the motion of Councilor Marks and that is seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9203.7s">And</a>  let's see, we have Councilor Knight wanted to speak on this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9207.202s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9208.967s">Mr.</a>  President, I'm glad that we're finally getting to the finish line on this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9213.05s">It's</a>  been long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9214.35s">I</a>  can remember filing the initial resolution asking Mayor Burke's staff to craft an ordinance some three and a half years ago, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9222.495s">And</a>  in looking at the final product that we have here before us, I think it looks great. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9226.037s">I</a>  do have concern, and one of the concerns, the only concern I have about it is the enforceability of the seven barrels and the ambiguity of the seven barrels. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9239.448s">In</a>  the Seawind District, breweries operating with seven barrels or under would be allowed by right, and breweries operating with more than seven barrels would be allowable by special permit of the Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9247.628s">Well,</a>  who's the barrel police and what's the parameter? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9252.632s">Is</a>  it seven barrels a day, seven barrels a week, seven barrels a month, seven barrels a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9256.595s">I</a>  guess is my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9257.876s">It's</a>  not going to prevent me from voting on the ordinance this evening, Mr. President, but I certainly think it's food for thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9263.141s">I</a>  don't think that we're going to have somebody out there that's going to be the barrel police that's measuring liquid to see who serves seven barrels versus seven and a quarter or seven and a half or eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9271.808s">And</a>  I just don't see how that aspect of the ordinance is enforceable and what precludes somebody from <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9277.492s">applying</a>  for a special permit by right at seven barrels, but then going over the seven barrel. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9286.109s">limit</a>  how are we going to know, how are we going to enforce, what's the parameters and standards that are going to be put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9291.813s">That's</a>  the only issue that I have, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9293.875s">But</a>  this is taking too long for us to come to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9297.478s">So</a>  with that being said, if it does pose a problem, we can always take it up at a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9301.861s">But</a>  I do think that that's a deficiency in our ordinance here this evening.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9306.745s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9308.598s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9309.439s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9310.66s">Just</a>  the seven barrels is actually the size of the brewing system, not the amount of beer produced. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9315.884s">So</a>  I think, I don't know who the enforcement authority would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9318.786s">I</a>  think that we could appoint multiple people who would otherwise be approving a license to review to make sure that it is a seven barrel system or not.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9334.459s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9337.637s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9341.298s">So</a>  we do have an established look at commission, and I would think they would be the appropriate body to- Right, right, right, to be the enforcement authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9352.922s">But</a>  I agree, and we have a fishing industry, and you can only catch a certain number of fish. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9360.584s">We</a>  don't have state or federal officials on the boats. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9364.166s">They</a>  have a quota that they're allowed to get, and it's on an honor system, and they keep track of it and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9369.709s">And</a>  I would see this as no difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9371.69s">If</a>  there is a limitation on what can be produced or the size or whatever it is, that would be the case in this as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9381.135s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9383.156s">Any</a>  other questions or comments from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9387.619s">We</a>  do have one person that wants to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9391.603s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9392.884s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9396.148s">Name</a>  and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Belythe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9398.53s">My</a>  name is Nick Belythe of 20 Dutton Circle.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9403.414s">Nick,</a>  do you have a minute and a half?</p>

    <p>[Belythe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9407.038s">I'm</a>  sorry, I'm having some Zoom issues amongst many other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9410.081s">Don't</a>  worry. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9411.809s">Just</a>  to address Councillor Knight's concern, the way with alcohol creation basically you're making it, the TTP, basically the government, when you put together a brewing system, you actually have a monitoring set up so the government gets their taxes for everything, and that directly is <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9435.365s">how</a>  you gauge the volume of beer produced. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9438.13s">So</a>  there is an ordinance which is set up, so- Nick, one minute.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9441.615s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9443.518s">Councilor</a>  Knight, one minute.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9445.021s">Let</a>  me get your microphone.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9446.676s">I</a>  certainly can appreciate the gentleman seeing through the trees to see the forest. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9452.818s">It</a>  was about taxation and how we were going to recuperate money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9455.78s">And</a>  I'm confident that we'll be all right moving forward with the languages here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9461.102s">So</a>  with that being said, but it was more about how we're going to be able to monitor it because it's a revenue generating issue as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9466.364s">So</a>  his astute business mind picked up on that relatively quickly.</p>

    <p>[Belythe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9471.118s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9472.058s">As</a>  I said, when a brewing system is set up, you actually have a specific tank that is set up with the TTP, which is the government body for taxation of alcohol. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9481.721s">And</a>  that monitors the volume of beer that's produced through the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9485.042s">And</a>  that is then the checks and balances, because Uncle Sam wants to make sure he gets all the money they deserve and they want.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9493.584s">Uncle</a>  Adam does, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9494.504s">You</a>  can count me as an Uncle Zach.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9499.806s">Thank</a>  you, Nick.</p>

    <p>[Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9501.67s">All</a>  right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9504.191s">I'll</a>  be quiet now.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9506.452s">No</a>  worries, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9508.433s">Okay,</a>  let's see, so there is a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9513.955s">Seeing</a>  that there's no one else has a hand up, so.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9517.077s">Second</a>  the motion.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9517.697s">Okay,</a>  on the motion on the floor, there is a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9520.098s">That</a>  motion was by Councilor Marks, and it was seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9526.321s">And</a>  it was- As amended motion, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9528.822s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Marks to</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9532.079s">Include</a>  the language from the CD board as recommended.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9537.043s">On</a>  that motion, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9542.288s">It</a>  is to adopt as amended.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9674.147s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9676.268s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9678.123s">In</a>  review of the selection committee ordinance, I see that our esteemed counsel from KP Law has failed to include the local 3% tax option language that was requested of him on multiple occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9695.367s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'd make a motion to amend the CAC ordinance to have the city solicitor, not KP Law, as previously asked multiple times, but our city solicitor, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9707.54s">to</a>  draft language to include the local 3% tax option to generate revenues for the city as an impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9718.768s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9721.71s">OK,</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight, do you have the language to that Councilor Knight's motion?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9730.377s">He's</a>  asking the city solicitor and not KP Law <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9737.059s">To</a>  draft language to include the local 3% tax option to generate revenue for the city.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_41]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9741.763s">As</a>  previously directed to KP law on multiple occasions and it never got in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9745.265s">Yes,</a>  that's correct.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9750.469s">So</a>  on that motion by Councilor Knight, that is seconded by Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9756.894s">You</a>  want to speak up? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9759.235s">You</a>  good? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9761.297s">So</a>  on that motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9766.997s">And</a>  I don't see any hands up, so I think we're good there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9768.718s">Any</a>  councilors want to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9769.979s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9772.12s">Councilor</a>  Marks, one second please. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9773.681s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9777.244s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9778.304s">I'd</a>  be remiss if I did not thank the subcommittee for their work on this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9785.089s">This</a>  was countless meetings over a long period of time, and a lot of time and effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9793.374s">went</a>  into this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9795.337s">I</a>  realize that many other communities have come out with their ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9801.345s">But</a>  let me tell you, this was crafted in a way that I feel comfortable and residents of this community should feel comfortable that there are many safeguards in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9810.798s">in</a>  this ordinance, Mr. President, that protects neighborhoods, protects residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9816.66s">It</a>  was a thoughtful ordinance that was put together, and I want to thank Chairman Knight and Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Caraviello for their countless hours on putting this together, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9830.324s">This</a>  doesn't happen by chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9832.685s">This</a>  happens by work, and I appreciate my colleagues' work on this.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9837.426s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9838.546s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9839.427s">Oh,</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9843.895s">He</a>  was originally on the committee back five years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9846.777s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9848.118s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9859.899s">I</a>  appreciate Councilman Marks bringing that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9861.76s">But</a>  again, what people don't see behind the scenes is the work that Councilman Knight puts in when the camera's not on him. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9869.728s">And</a>  I think that all the questions we had during those <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9875.273s">Those</a>  meetings and before those meetings, it was always Councilor Knight that was the go-to guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9880.277s">So</a>  I think that he put in the hours and effort to really make us shine finally and get this through and moving it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9891.545s">So</a>  there's a lot of good reasons why we need this, whether you believe in it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9897.309s">But</a>  again, we appreciate your work, Councilor Knight, and thank you again.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9903.629s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9904.389s">Scarpelli,</a>  Council of Mayors.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9906.151s">I</a>  want to echo the thanks of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9909.092s">And</a>  if Councilor Knight is amenable, could we also amend this motion to also be a motion to table? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9915.276s">So</a>  we only have to take one roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9918.738s">All</a>  good?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9920.679s">Yeah,</a>  sure.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9921.78s">Whichever</a>  date you prefer.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9923.081s">October</a>  6th or is that?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9925.082s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9925.762s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9929.885s">One</a>  second, Councilor, Vice President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9937.409s">I</a>  was just referring to the CAC.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9944.955s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Villes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9945.876s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9946.917s">Mr.</a>  President, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9947.758s">I</a>  didn't hear what Councilor Villes said. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9949.319s">If</a>  you could repeat it, I'd appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9951.341s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9951.821s">I</a>  was saying that if we could make a motion to amend amendment to Councilor Knight's motion so that we table it to a date certain so we only have to take one roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9960.929s">And</a>  that's just for the CAC, not for the zoning.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9965.506s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9966.146s">Would</a>  any of the councils like to speak on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9969.927s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9971.808s">We</a>  just need a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9972.568s">The</a>  clerk had to step away for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9974.169s">So,</a>  so thank you everyone for your hard work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9980.111s">This</a>  was definitely a lot of time, a lot of time, effort and energy went into this, actually into both ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9988.053s">So</a>  thank you to everyone that was involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9990.454s">Appreciate</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9992.575s">So</a>  we will, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9994.551s">We</a>  checked away for the clerk to get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9996.072s">He</a>  should be back in a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9998.694s">Thank</a>  you everyone for your patience.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_39]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10004.459s">Mr.</a>  President, can I be so bold as to offer a motion to waive the reading of the paper?</p>

    <p>[Navar]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10011.725s">You</a>  make one big motion.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10024.346s">Mr.</a>  Clark.</p>

    <p>[Sullivan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10024.866s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10029.827s">Okay,</a>  so, let's see, Councilor Bierce had a motion to table, bless you, to table this to a date certain October 6th.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10044.07s">As</a>  an amendment to Councilor Knight's motion to request.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10047.031s">Yes,</a>  okay, so the main motion was basically to, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10051.345s">Which</a>  I think you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10052.025s">Do</a>  you have the main motion as far as sending this to the city solicitor? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10055.428s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10056.328s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10057.309s">And</a>  the amendment was to table to a date certain of October 6th.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10062.412s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10062.893s">And</a>  if required, I'd happy to make further amendment to waive the reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10070.758s">I</a>  don't know if that's required or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10074.16s">You</a>  didn't read the 10 page.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10081.704s">That's</a>  true.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10086.925s">We</a>  can read it when it comes back. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10089.106s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10089.806s">That's</a>  probably the best bet.</p>

    <p>[Costas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10090.886s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10091.946s">If</a>  that's okay with everyone here.</p>

    <p>[Heineck]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10093.467s">I</a>  just don't want to make you read it.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10097.088s">Yeah,</a>  because I mean, I don't want to read it if it's rough. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10101.089s">I</a>  read the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10101.709s">Not</a>  the CAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10102.029s">The</a>  zoning only. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10107.614s">I</a>  read all 17.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10108.274s">Mr.</a>  President, you did read all 17 pages of the zoning ordinance at one point.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10113.637s">Yes,</a>  I remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10116.919s">I</a>  do too. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10118.0s">Scott.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10120.021s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10120.741s">So</a>  on the motion of, so this is with regard to the CAC ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10127.084s">Can</a>  you just read back the motion so we don't have it, Clerk Rodriguez?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10131.207s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10132.367s">Council</a>  night's original motion <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10135.049s">You</a>  move to have the city solicitor and not KP draft language to include the local 3% tax option to generate revenue for the city as previously directed to KP law on multiple occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10149.495s">And</a>  then council bears amendment was to move the table to a date certain, October 6th.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10154.858s">Yes,</a>  the CAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10155.498s">The</a>  CAC.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10406.458s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10407.959s">Here</a>  we are, what, ten months into the year, and we have a number of ordinances that we've requested drafts of. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10414.562s">We've</a>  gotten some back, we haven't gotten others. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10418.224s">With</a>  the craziness that's going around with how government operates these days, with City Hall being half open and half closed, with the council being half open and half closed, I thought this would be a good opportunity for us to keep some of the items that this council's concerned about on the forefront, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10432.371s">I</a>  know in the past, we've had situations where <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10435.572s">Papers</a>  get filed and then they kick around for quite a bit of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10439.054s">For</a>  example, the marijuana ordinance that we just talked about that took five years to come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10444.158s">So</a>  with that being said, this is an effort as the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. President, to get our work product out and get it out in an expedient fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10451.062s">I</a>  think ten months to wait is plenty of time for us to request an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10455.145s">And</a>  if we can sit down with the city solicitor and go over where we are and the progress that we've made on some of these items, I think we'll be able to put out even a better work product. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10465.251s">This</a>  council's shown that it's been able to put out ordinances and has quite a vision for what the legislative body should be doing and for what legislative process should look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10476.024s">And</a>  I just want to make sure, Mr. President, as the chairman of the subcommittee, that we're living up to the expectations of the residents here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10481.95s">So</a>  with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10485.092s">It</a>  would be three meetings, October, November, December, and the second Tuesday of each of those months for us to get a better handle on where we're at in the draft ordinance process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10495.038s">I've</a>  had the opportunity to speak with Solicitor Scanlon, and she's started to do legwork for some of this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10500.261s">It's</a>  no reflection on the work of her office or that of the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10503.643s">What</a>  it is, it's a reflection on this body and our willingness and desire to put out a favorable work product to the residents in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10510.667s">So</a>  with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10513.668s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10514.868s">Councilor</a>  Pierce.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10611.016s">Councilor</a>  Layton. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10611.696s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10613.096s">Since</a>  the C-Click Fix program has been implemented, I have offered this resolution annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10617.958s">I</a>  feel as though it's very important that the council be provided with a breakdown of what types of requests are being made by our citizenry and whether or not they're being brought to a resolve that meets their satisfaction and expectation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10629.94s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'm requesting this data because data drive decision making. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10634.501s">And</a>  when we can take a look at these C-Click fix requests, we might also be able to identify where our deficiencies lie in the deliverance of services here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10645.413s">And</a>  then when the budget process rolls around, we have a better idea as to where we need to invest our funds to be sure that the taxpayers are receiving the level of services that they're so duly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10657.084s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I ask that my council colleagues support the measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10660.645s">What</a>  it is, is it's a tool for us to gather data to be more informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10663.886s">So</a>  when the budget process starts, we can have the opportunity to reallocate funds to those areas where we feel as though we can do better.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10672.208s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10673.069s">Councilor</a>  Bears?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10674.969s">Second</a>  and move approval.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10676.409s">Okay,</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight, second by Councilor Bears, I believe Jackie Peeks, did you want to speak on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10686.241s">We</a>  have Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10689.442s">Jackie,</a>  then you can.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10690.882s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10692.343s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10693.283s">I</a>  want to thank my council colleague for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10696.444s">I</a>  just want to make sure we have the correct terminology because I'm not sure if that system tracks items that are resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10707.774s">It</a>  may or may not, I think it will state whether they're closed or not, which doesn't necessarily reflect whether they're resolved or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10716.639s">So</a>  maybe Jackie can expound on that, but I want to make sure if we're comparing apples to apples that, because I think it is a vital tool, as Councilor Knight mentioned, that this C-Click fix should be used during a budgetary process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10732.168s">So</a>  we can see the number one request and see what's happening in the community and use that as a budget tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10738.709s">So</a>  I agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10740.13s">I</a>  just want to make sure we're able to extract what we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10744.931s">So</a>  maybe it would be helpful to find out what the terminology is.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10748.151s">Mr.</a>  President, on that, I remember sitting back and we were talking about C-Click fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10753.933s">And</a>  I believe it was a request that was made on DCR-owned property. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10761.054s">been</a>  two previous administrations ago, maybe a previous administration ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10763.996s">And</a>  the discussion was issue resolved, and the response was, that's state property, call the DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10771.079s">And</a>  that's the issue isn't resolved, the buck was passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10773.461s">And</a>  I remember Councilman Marks bringing that up, because he got a call from a resident that wasn't too satisfied with the answer that they got. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10779.203s">And</a>  it was mocked as resolved, but it really wasn't resolved, it was closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10782.605s">So</a>  I certainly share your position on this, Council.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10787.196s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_41]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10788.276s">And</a>  I'll be happy to amend the paper any which way that meets that objective.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10793.518s">Jackie.</a> </p>

    <p>[Peeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10794.999s">Jackie</a>  Peek from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10798.2s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10799.781s">So</a>  in terms of the current terminology that's used, I have to admit, I'm not 100% certain. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10804.623s">But</a>  I did want to just let the council know, we are currently working on, I'm going to call a complete revamp of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10813.906s">So,</a>  you know, we'll certainly be able to provide information that we have on how, but in the next few months, that should be greatly improved in enough ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10823.896s">Lisa</a>  Giuliani from the Mayor's Office is spearheading that and is working internally to sort of understand how the system is currently and how we can make it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10834.426s">And</a>  we anticipate doing some testing to make sure that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10838.433s">It's</a>  a truly solid product, and that we can follow up with constituents, just as you're discussing now, and really determining what the responses are, and if they're truly marked as resolved, and what that looks like, and sort of making it a complete loop of feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10856.408s">So,</a>  we anticipate that that will be rolled out as soon as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10860.892s">We're</a>  actively working with the QuickTrack format currently.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10866.693s">Thoughts</a>  on the marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10868.454s">So</a>  just to follow up, Jackie, what are the reported items that you can currently draw from now?</p>

    <p>[Peeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10878.081s">I</a>  don't have it up on my screen, so I'd have to just bring that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10883.083s">It</a>  covers a whole host of topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10884.604s">I</a>  think one of the things that we want to sort of expand upon is we've asked departments who currently use the system to report to us how they're using it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10894.709s">So,</a>  you know, just making sure that the options that are available now are being utilized to the best of their ability and figuring out if there's ways that we can improve that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10905.013s">And</a>  then, like I said, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10907.165s">some</a>  soft testing, understanding what members of the community would potentially like to see and how we can grow what's currently there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10914.83s">So,</a>  you know, there's quite a few options in there ranging from, you know, DPW and popular requests and things like that to health concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10925.438s">But,</a>  you know, for example, reporting rodent activity and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10931.502s">But</a>  what's there now, we're hoping to even expand upon further and make it a little bit more detailed.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10938.066s">So</a>  just if I could, I don't want to belabor the point, but maybe if I pose it a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10943.147s">Currently</a>  right now, are you able to see within C-Click Fix, as Councilor Knight mentioned in his report, are you able to see if things are resolved? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10953.17s">Or</a>  if they're just closed out?</p>

    <p>[Peeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10955.31s">Or,</a>  you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10958.271s">Yeah,</a>  so on the back end there we can see <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10962.625s">you</a>  know, a little bit more detail than is, I think, reported publicly at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10966.307s">But</a>  I'm going to check with Lisa and sort of see what is currently there and what can be reported out. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10972.369s">But,</a>  you know, we, and I know that what's available to us, we also can sort of dig a little bit deeper and get, get reports on what's been resolved and sort of over how long of a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10983.054s">So</a>  we can, we can certainly get a little bit of detail on the back end. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10989.872s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10990.332s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11016.892s">Jackie,</a>  if I may, is there a list of reports that comes out of that system? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11024.672s">Pre-made</a>  canned reports?</p>

    <p>[Peeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11028.993s">Are</a>  you asking whether we have the ability to do it or whether we're currently reporting out on our mobile?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11033.454s">No,</a>  whether or not the system has the ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11036.135s">A</a>  lot of systems, when you get them, they come with canned reports that give you different metrics each month. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11042.816s">I</a>  was wondering if you have a list of reports that maybe come with it, so we could take a look at that list and maybe say, okay, these are things that we would want to see on a monthly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11052.498s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Peeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11056.843s">I</a>  guess, having it up in front of me, I'd have to double check on it, but I think that there's a report that we can run or create to provide data of some sort. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11066.945s">I</a>  guess we'd want to know a little bit more about the kinds of specific data that you're requesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11072.307s">I</a>  know one of them is whether or not things will resolve and what that actually means. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11078.808s">But</a>  I think the short answer is yes, there is some sort of a report that can be done.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11083.052s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11084.393s">Councilor</a>  Marks, do you have any questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11085.534s">I'm</a>  good, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11086.155s">Okay,</a>  Councilor Knight, did you have any questions?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11087.876s">I</a>  don't, I thank Councilor Marks for bringing up the point there.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11090.678s">Okay,</a>  thank you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11094.441s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11095.362s">Any</a>  other questions from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11098.945s">I</a>  don't see anybody's hands raised, so I think we're good here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11101.367s">Okay,</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11106.992s">Clerk</a>  Hernandez, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11112.128s">Councilor</a>  Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11113.709s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11115.21s">Vice</a>  President Caraballo? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11116.39s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11117.871s">Councilor</a>  Night? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11118.572s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11119.812s">Councilor</a>  Marks?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11168.356s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11170.017s">The</a>  condition that our public utility providers and others that are offered street opening permits leave our streets in is something that's been a topic of conversation before this board for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11182.705s">Earlier</a>  this evening, for example, we had several grants of location and some of the things that we talked about were curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11189.005s">Paving,</a>  how long the project's going to take, where the project's going to be located. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11193.43s">But</a>  I think, Mr. President, a lot of these times when we issue a street opening permit, and maybe it's not for a half a mile of roadway like we issued earlier today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11202.28s">Maybe</a>  it's only for 50 linear feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11205.063s">It</a>  gets forgotten about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11206.565s">And</a>  that final restoration never happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11208.967s">And</a>  we've seen places all over the community where we see trenches and patches and road work that's just fallen apart that our public utilities have performed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11218.292s">We've</a>  done a great job holding them accountable when they're coming before us for grants of location and things that are in our scope and our authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11224.056s">But</a>  I think we can step it up a notch, Mr. President, and begin to look at the street opening permits when they're issued and what the follow-up protocols are to be sure that the taxpayers in the community and the residents in the community <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11236.309s">are</a>  afforded the opportunity to have their streets restored to the same condition that they were in prior to these construction and ground opening permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11242.891s">When</a>  these ground opening permits are issued, it's usually for the purpose of underground utility work and underground utility upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11249.093s">And</a>  these underground utility upgrades allow the city to generate <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11254.176s">the</a>  ability to assess a personal property tax on the underground infrastructure that's being placed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11259.382s">But</a>  this underground infrastructure that's being placed along with the personal property tax that the city can get also provides the utility provider with the ability to have more efficient operations and in turn increase their profits. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11272.837s">So</a>  when we talk a lot about what's going on in the community and community benefits, we look at public utility providers that are very protected and very insulated through state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11281.907s">That</a>  aren't leaving our streets and our roadways in a condition that a lot of us feel would be suitable and satisfactory. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11287.353s">And</a>  this is an effort to make sure that this stays in the forefront, Mr. President, with the monthly report letting us know what roadways have been ripped up, when the construction took place, when the construction was completed, and what the plans are in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11299.901s">After</a>  six months, when they're going to get out there and get it done if they have to go there and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11303.523s">It</a>  also allows us the opportunity to monitor the list and make sure that after the six months is up that these roadways get restored. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11309.306s">So</a>  with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the paper.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11312.228s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11313.829s">Any</a>  questions from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11314.91s">Any</a>  comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11317.635s">Vice</a>  President Caviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11321.598s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11323.259s">I</a>  thank my fellow council for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11326.081s">Probably</a>  one of the most amount of calls that we get is for street openings that never ever get repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11334.988s">Again,</a>  if the permittee should be required to come back after six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11342.354s">Again,</a>  you can drive around the city and any street and you'll see sunken patches and don't worry, they're going to come back, they're going to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11350.86s">And</a>  the company never comes back. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11352.861s">So</a>  again, this is something that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11356.003s">I</a>  thank my council for putting it on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11358.104s">And</a>  it has gotten a little better under Tim McGiven. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11363.647s">But</a>  again, I think we still have a long way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11366.408s">And</a>  I second this motion, a motion for approval.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11369.67s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Carbiello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11370.871s">On</a>  a motion to council tonight.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11375.974s">Councilor</a>  Schell? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11377.314s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11378.215s">Let's</a>  see.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11379.821s">Councilor</a>  Scarpella. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11381.062s">Mr.</a>  President, I appreciate Councilor Ike bringing this forward and this is a great initiative moving forward because I think Councilor Caviello is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11389.748s">But</a>  one thing that we've talked about and <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11393.365s">And</a>  in most other communities, if not all of the communities, they have, I know Councilor Marks has mentioned a thousand times, a clerk of works. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11402.391s">That</a>  when there is any type of job, it's up to the city to make sure when that job is completed that there is someone there that signs off and then rechecks that in six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11414.5s">And</a>  I think that's what we're lacking here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11415.961s">We're</a>  lacking that layer of follow through. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11419.243s">So</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11422.185s">I</a>  don't know how we could move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11424.306s">I</a>  think that as we look as we move forward, and the tight budget's going to be even tighter, but I don't know if there's an avenue that our DPW director or our engineer can <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11442.943s">look</a>  into and find that person that's going to follow through with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11448.406s">because</a>  I know with the short staff that we have, these things fall through the cracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11455.451s">So</a>  again, I think that as we move forward looking for an effective way of having a clerk of the works that's going to follow through with these is going to be most effective, I think, than anything here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11467.559s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11469.94s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11472.242s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Night, seconded by Councilor, Vice President Caraballo, Clerk Cronin, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11495.244s">Yes,</a>  7 the affirmative, 0 the negative, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11497.687s">20-548</a>  offered by Councilor Knight, being resolved that the City Auditor conduct an audit of the Treasurer Collector's Office.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11505.666s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11507.186s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11509.967s">I've</a>  gotten a number of calls surrounding accounting, billing, and collections practices in the Treasurer-Collector's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11518.289s">When</a>  we sit there and we look at what's going on, we have no assistant Treasurer-Collector. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11522.07s">We</a>  have a temporary Treasurer-Collector, a part-time Treasurer-Collector that's a retiree that's been brought back. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11527.667s">So</a>  in the interest of financial transparency, Mr. President, and to address some of the concerns that have been raised by those in the community, I'd request that an audit be conducted for the first 10 months of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11539.119s">When</a>  we look at where we were this time a year ago, we had very, very, very aggressive collections under the previous administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11548.683s">A</a>  lot of money came in through the collections process, Mr. President, and I just want to make sure that we're doing the best that we can to ensure that these dollars are being captured and spent wisely.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11560.126s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11562.667s">Do</a>  you want to speak?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11563.208s">Mr.</a>  President?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11569.142s">Maybe</a>  if we can get an update from the city administration, I thought they did hire an assistant city treasurer. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11577.844s">I</a>  thought that position was filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11579.844s">But</a>  if we can get an update on that, there's been some transition in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11583.505s">And</a>  to be quite frank, we haven't received any correspondence on things that are going on within the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11589.686s">There's</a>  been people that have left positions and we haven't received any formal communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11596.906s">We</a>  can ask, Jackie should know that, but I thought they did bring on an assistant treasurer collector.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11606.329s">Jackie,</a>  I'm trying to, there you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11608.07s">Jackie,</a>  if you could please comment to Councilman Mark's question.</p>

    <p>[Peeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11613.431s">Councilman</a>  Mark's point is, you know, there's been a few changes and updates, and I'm happy to have Dave provide a report or update some information to you when he's back in the office later this week or early next.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11627.588s">What</a>  about regarding the assistant treasurer-collector? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11631.189s">Has</a>  that position been filled?</p>

    <p>[Peeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11634.551s">I</a>  haven't been directly involved in the hiring conversations, and I don't want to misspeak on that, so I do just want to double check on a couple of the things. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11642.793s">Now,</a>  I can hopefully report back in just a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11645.414s">I'm</a>  just going to double check, if you don't mind.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11649.976s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11651.417s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11653.311s">That</a>  particular office, in my opinion, is in good hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11659.796s">We</a>  have an acting treasurer-collector who was the former treasurer-collector for many, many years in this community and ran that office with the utmost respect and confidence and accounting methods. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11677.229s">And</a>  I'm not sure what <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11680.632s">The</a>  need is to have a city auditor audit the treasurer collector's office, unless there's an issue of concern, because there is a yearly audit that does take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11692.027s">And</a>  maybe we should be asking what the results were of the previous audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11697.194s">But</a>  I'm not sure what this would, we have a great staff down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11702.1s">They</a>  work very hard, and I'm not quite sure what this would accomplish, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11709.709s">So</a>  I will not be supporting this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11711.571s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11712.572s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11714.545s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd be happy to amend the paper to get three years of the last three years of the audits in that department to take a look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11721.15s">And</a>  then if there's any concern, I can pursue this paper at a future time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11725.393s">I'd</a>  ask the counselor if that would satisfy his question and maybe allow him the opportunity to support this paper with that amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11736.782s">So</a>  often as a motion to amend Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11743.186s">Councilman,</a>  you're amending the resolution to look at the last three years?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11793.215s">Just</a>  a clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11794.656s">Would</a>  that amendment be instead of conducting a new audit, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11798.76s">Strike</a>  and replace, got it, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11801.622s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11802.343s">Vice</a>  President Caviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11803.864s">Mr.</a>  President, if we could also amend that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11807.967s">I</a>  remember back in May, during the budget season, the chief of staff said we were on the verge of hiring a treasurer. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11820.055s">Can</a>  we have an update on where we are with the hiring process of a new treasurer? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11824.058s">A</a>  permanent treasurer? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11827.979s">I</a>  have confidence in Mr. Pompeo, but it was said that we were ready to hire a new treasurer.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11839.804s">Okay,</a>  so point of information, Counsel Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11846.574s">I</a>  don't want this to turn into a referendum on the qualifications or the abilities of Mr. Pompeo, but Mr. Pompeo is also limited to the number of hours that he can work as a retiree. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11856.647s">So</a>  as a retiree in the public pension system, he's limited to 960 hours a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11864.286s">If</a>  there's no assistant, then he's limited to 960 hours a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11867.448s">That's</a>  why I raised the concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11869.75s">But</a>  it's not a reflection of the duties or the work that he does down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11872.652s">It's</a>  a reflection of the staffing levels down there and the level of productivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11877.656s">But</a>  with that being said, I've amended the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11879.497s">I</a>  just don't want this to be turned into a referendum on Mr. Pompeo because that wasn't my intention in any way, shape, or form.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11886.638s">But</a>  if I can offer in the form of amendment of where we are in the hiring of a treasurer.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11890.001s">Okay,</a>  so an amendment by Vice President Caviello to receive an update with regard to hiring a new treasurer?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11898.51s">Of</a>  the treasurer.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11899.07s">Mr.</a>  President, do you have an amendment of Vice President Caviello?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11905.517s">Update</a>  of the hiring process for a permanent treasurer.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11908.2s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11911.545s">I</a>  just want to make sure we're requesting the appropriate reports for the audit.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11918.227s">So</a>  it's my understanding the independent audit that we hired, independent outside audit, comes in and audits City Hall yearly, so once a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11929.552s">So</a>  that would be an independent audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11931.832s">The</a>  auditor from the city does a monthly audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11936.997s">So</a>  I just want to make sure whatever we're requesting is what we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11940.739s">Do</a>  we want the independent audit that's done on a yearly basis, three years worth of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11945.982s">Or</a>  do we want to look at three years worth of a monthly audit that's done internally? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11951.685s">So</a>  I just want to make sure we're on the same page.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11954.961s">Big</a>  picture of Mr. President would be the way that I'd like to look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11957.742s">Three</a>  years, 12 months in a packet, you know what I mean, is the way that I'd prefer it.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11961.764s">From</a>  the independent audit? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11963.404s">The</a>  independent audit, not the internal audit, yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_41]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11965.605s">Then</a>  we can take a look at those monthlies afterwards and see, you know.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11969.766s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Locks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11970.647s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11971.527s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11972.828s">I</a>  wouldn't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11974.088s">I</a>  don't see any harm in just asking for both up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11977.409s">I'd</a>  like both if people are open to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11994.627s">I</a>  just don't see any difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11996.448s">If</a>  it's a lot, I'd like more time to read it.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12000.79s">Is</a>  that an amendment?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12003.231s">Yes,</a>  an amendment to receive both the independent audit and the monthly city audits.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12009.774s">Okay,</a>  so we have a further amendment by Council Beers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12016.75s">Okay,</a>  any other questions or comments?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12025.796s">Your</a>  microphone is now on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12027.878s">And</a>  we all received an email, I think it was about a week, week and a half ago, from a resident that was very concerned about his automobile excise tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12038.848s">And</a>  he stated at the time that he usually gets a bill in the mail for his auto excise tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12044.754s">This</a>  year he did not get the bill in the mail for his excise tax and therefore forgot to pay it and he got a surcharge. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12052.799s">In</a>  addition to that surcharge, his wife, who the city goes into her account and automatically withdraws the excise, didn't go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12062.91s">Supposedly,</a>  according to this resident, didn't go in and withdraw the amount for the excise tax from her account and it went in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12075.442s">they</a>  again charged a surcharge that wasn't her fault because the city was supposed to go in and remove the amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12082.467s">I</a>  think I'm explaining the email correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12085.028s">So</a>  I think some of that issue, Mr. President, I'm hoping maybe we can resolve by asking maybe the acting treasurer collector regarding that particular incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12098.199s">And</a>  if that's, because the email we got made it sound like it was a systemic problem throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12105.523s">And</a>  this was happening to lots of people throughout the community, and not an isolated incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12111.607s">So</a>  I think that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12113.429s">Maybe</a>  as part of this paper, if Councilor Knight doesn't mind, we can ask that question directly to the Treasurer-Collector's Office.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_39]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12120.013s">I'd</a>  be happy to support that amendment, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12121.874s">Okay,</a>  so that's an amendment from Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12125.572s">Mr.</a>  President, I didn't get all the wording of Council Marks' amendment.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12133.399s">That</a>  the treasurer collect a report back to the Memphis City Council regarding a concern of excise tax in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12144.548s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12145.329s">And</a>  then I can elaborate more on, that's the general gist.</p>

    <p>[Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12149.893s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12155.165s">Okay,</a>  any other questions or comments from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12157.488s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12161.172s">On</a>  the motion of council tonight, seconded by Councilor Marks, as amended by Vice President Caviello, Councilor Beers, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12172.865s">Did</a>  I miss anything?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12178.956s">Councilor</a>  Night amended the original motion, or original resolution as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12186.182s">It</a>  was a strike and replace.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12187.483s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12188.504s">On</a>  that motion, Clerk Curtis, please come along.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12193.869s">Councilor</a>  Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12195.37s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12196.651s">Vice</a>  President Caravaglia? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12199.053s">Councilor</a>  Night? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12199.754s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12200.995s">Councilor</a>  Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12201.956s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12203.317s">Councilor</a>  Morell?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12204.318s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12205.359s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12206.38s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12208.283s">Yes,</a>  70 affirmative, 0 in the negative, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12211.004s">2-0-549</a>  offered by Council of the Night and Vice President Caviello, whereas Razzo's Grill opened on Mystic Avenue, September 5th, 2005, and whereas since that time owner and proprietor Richard Razzo has been an invaluable contributor to the city of Medford through <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12228.268s">through</a>  countless donations and other acts of kindness. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12230.79s">And</a>  whereas September 5th, 2020 marks the 15th anniversary of Roswell's Grove grand opening, we have resolved that the Memphis City Council thank Richard Roswell for his commitment to the community and congratulate Roswell's Grove for 15 years of success. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12250.495s">Anniversary</a>  and be a further resolve that he be presented with a consultation memorial memorializing this momentous event console night</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12593.245s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12594.726s">Yeah,</a>  as Councilor Caviello mentioned, Teresa was the wife of former city manager John Glioni. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12604.109s">And</a>  when John was here running the city, Teresa was running the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12609.731s">As</a>  they always say, behind every good man is a better woman, and this is no different. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12614.793s">What</a>  a great family the Glioni's raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12617.735s">My</a>  dear friend, Janine McGonigal, Teresa was her mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12621.844s">And</a>  she will be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12623.705s">I'd</a>  just like to offer my condolences to the family and ask that my council colleagues join Councilor Caviello and I in doing the same.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12897.543s">Relatively</a>  self-explanatory, Mr. President, in the September 8th packet, we did receive a draft ordinance that we requested.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12903.005s">I</a>  believe it was at the direction of Councilor Caviello, and based off a previous paper that was issued in the previous session, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12909.907s">But</a>  with that being said, the solicitor's office has put out a work product for us to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12913.829s">And</a>  I'd ask that a COW be scheduled so that we can have the opportunity to do such.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12917.57s">Thank</a>  you very much, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12919.471s">It</a>  is on my list. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12920.651s">I</a>  will be scheduling a meeting on that soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12925.094s">Vice</a>  President Caviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12926.415s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12927.576s">Mr.</a>  President, this is something I proposed as Councilor Knight said last year, and I'm glad to see that it's finally come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12934.281s">I</a>  think many of us remember that fiasco at the Fellsway Plaza, where there was just stuff, trash piled up all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12943.707s">And</a>  then other ones, and I did reach out to a couple of the owners of all of these companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12951.873s">And</a>  some of the language that they sent out to me, I forwarded on to the solicitor's office, but they were all amiable to having this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12961.435s">They</a>  said we were one of the few cities that had nothing, and there was no fees ever collected for putting these bins all over the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12969.517s">So</a>  I'm glad this has come forward, and I look forward to the council meeting to get this resolved and move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12980.059s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12981.138s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor, Vice President Carviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12984.639s">On</a>  the motion of Council Knight, seconded by Vice President Carviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12988.68s">Clerk</a>  Herderby, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13007.701s">Yes,</a>  70 affirmatives, 0 in the negative, the motion passes.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13010.223s">2-0--</a>  I move to withdraw, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13013.265s">Okay,</a>  2-0-552 has been withdrawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13016.647s">2-0-553</a>  offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request a report from the school committee on its plans to address truancy during remote learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13030.538s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13032.159s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13034.892s">The</a>  Knight Early Education Academy over on Woburn Street has been up and running now for almost a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13043.179s">And</a>  it's a trying experience, to say the least. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13048.224s">But</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13051.4s">One</a>  thing I'm noticing is that there's a need for us to be sure that those that don't have the same opportunities as others are still being provided the access to a quality public education. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13065.197s">And</a>  truancy is one of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13067.86s">one</a>  of those situations that's something that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13071.042s">And</a>  our surrounding communities, some of them have multiple full-time truancy offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13075.724s">I</a>  believe at one point the city of Somerville had three full-time truancy offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13080.867s">I'm</a>  not saying or alluding to the fact that truancy is a problem in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13085.529s">But</a>  what I am saying is that based upon the new times that are before us and the expectations that have been expressed through our school committee and through that of DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13096.896s">the</a>  direction of the superintendent, ultimately our goal is to get kids back in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13101.643s">But</a>  until then, we're going to be relying on remote learning or hybrid learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13106.53s">And</a>  my <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13108.703s">concern</a>  is that certain subsects of our population are going to slip through the cracks and not be provided with the same opportunities that others are being provided during this time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13118.49s">So</a>  as the parent of a first grader and understanding that during these formidable years, the importance that education plays in the long-term development of <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13128.917s">an</a>  academic student raises concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13132.338s">So</a>  I'd ask that the school committee just provide us with a report as to what their plans are and how to address truancy during the pandemic and during the hybrid learning, during from home learning, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13144.3s">I</a>  think it's very important that we understand what's going on so that we can ensure that all the students across the board are being provided with an ample opportunity to be educated properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13155.991s">I'd</a>  like to further amend the paper to Mr. President and request a report from the school department indicating how many students we've lost to private schools between last year and this year due to the school closures. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13167.383s">So</a>  with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support the paper.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13171.167s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13173.389s">Councilor</a>  Beers? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13175.051s">Nope?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13175.411s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13176.212s">Councilor</a>  Morell?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13177.605s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13178.906s">I</a>  understand the councilor's concerns around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13181.067s">However,</a>  as the school committee doesn't report to the city council and there's not really much action we could take on this, I'm not sure I could support this, although I do support the amendment, so I'm conflicted there because as the amendment would later tie to budget ramifications, I understand that information is important to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13198.199s">But</a>  regarding reports on truancy, I'm not sure what this body would actually do with something like that, especially considering the committee does not report to the council.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13207.22s">Mr.</a>  President, although the committee does not report to the council in terms of policy, the buck does stop here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13212.963s">The</a>  buck stops here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13214.844s">So</a>  if we're seeing a problem with truancy and we have one part-time truancy officer here in the community, maybe the council says it's time to kick it up a notch. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13221.827s">Maybe</a>  you gotta hire a couple more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13224.288s">And</a>  if you don't, then maybe we're going to have to hold back some funding over here until you do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13228.71s">So</a>  there's an opportunity in a way for us, Mr. President, very similar to the way that we were able to <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13233.072s">broker</a>  a deal with the historical commission and the property owner to promote and push for certain aspects of a better quality public education. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13243.677s">And</a>  where the council controls the purse strings, and truancy is a concern, and there's a school department policy and a city policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13251.761s">I</a>  do believe that surrounds some of this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13253.582s">I</a>  think it's important that we know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13255.662s">I</a>  guess my question is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13256.983s">Why</a>  don't we want to know what their policy is on truancy? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13260.264s">And</a>  why wouldn't we expect them to have one? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13262.965s">It's</a>  not so much that we want to force something down their throat. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13266.687s">All</a>  we're doing is asking them to report back to the council with a report on what its plans are to address truancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13274.069s">It's</a>  not a request to tell them to make a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13276.17s">It's</a>  not a request to tell them how to do it, where to do it, or when to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13279.151s">It's</a>  a request to fill us in and give us information as to what you're doing to make sure that this situation doesn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13285.636s">I</a>  can certainly appreciate the council's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13288.678s">However,</a>  knowledge is power and the more knowledge we have, the better off we're going to be and the better job we're going to be able to do for the people and especially the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13296.543s">As</a>  a parent, Mr. President, this is very concerning to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13300.046s">Two</a>  young children at home, a six year old and a four year old. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13303.428s">The</a>  day before school was supposed to start, my four year old lost his daycare. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13308.131s">So</a>  people are struggling through this, and the more information that we have, the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13312.476s">And</a>  the other thing that's important, Mr. President, is if we do see a truancy problem, usually the truancy problem isn't necessarily rooted in anything other than things going on at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13323.628s">And</a>  while the school committee does have certain authority, the city has far more resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13329.474s">when</a>  it comes down to family issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13332.116s">So</a>  that's another opportunity, Mr. President, for us to gain some more information and then maybe modify or amend the types of services that we deliver to the residents here based upon the data that we're receiving to see what makes sense to be sure that the taxpayers are getting the level of services that they so deserve.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13349.406s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Night. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13352.027s">Councilor</a>  Morell, are you all set? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13354.909s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13355.249s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13474.414s">Mr.</a>  President, this was an issue that the council spoke about several weeks back regarding the need for additional assistance within the registrar voters office. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13486.64s">I</a>  have yet to see a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13489.982s">that</a>  addresses the council concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13492.944s">And</a>  this is not just the council concern, this is concern of many, many residents, if not thousands of residents, Mr. President, that just went through a primary election and some of the concerns that were associated with a new COVID type system. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13513.458s">with</a>  mail-in ballots and so forth of the likes that we've never seen in this community before. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13519.143s">The</a>  reason why I bring this up, Mr. President, is that we have an election, a very important election coming up in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13526.789s">We</a>  have a presidential election coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13529.952s">And</a>  it's vital as a community that we have the resources to handle the election, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13539.299s">Interesting</a>  fact that I just found out, since 2010, in this community, the number of voters went up by 55% compared to 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13553.824s">I've</a>  been telling people over the last several years, when they ask me how many voters we have in the community, I was rattling out a figure that I recall it was about 35,000 registered voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13568.658s">Unbeknownst,</a>  Mr. President, we're up over 40,000 registered voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13575.583s">So</a>  I was about 5,000 voters off from the last figure I had, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13581.787s">This</a>  is only to show that the number of voters in this community has increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13587.73s">The</a>  capacity in that office has not increased over the years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13593.454s">And</a>  it's about time that we hire someone to assist the city clerk who wears many hats in his role. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13602.178s">And</a>  it's about time that we hire an election coordinator, someone that can go into the office, Mr. President, and run the registrar of voters office. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13613.764s">Now</a>  election coordinator would not be just a figurehead. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13618.166s">An</a>  election coordinator would address personnel needs, address issues of concern at all the polling locations, especially in a time of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13629.614s">We're</a>  talking about increased safety for polling workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13633.076s">We're</a>  talking about plexiglass. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13634.657s">We're</a>  talking about masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13636.058s">We're</a>  talking about sanitizing after someone goes into a polling booth. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13639.821s">There's</a>  a lot more responsibility and things associated in this new COVID era that we're experiencing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13649.167s">The</a>  election coordinator would also be involved with the training of wardens, clerks, and inspectors for the elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13659.533s">The</a>  election coordinator would be responsible for the maintaining and date working knowledge of <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13666.938s">election</a>  law as set forth by the Secretary of State's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13670.941s">They</a>  would oversee the distribution of the absentee and no excuse mail-in ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13676.604s">They</a>  would follow and maintain all mandated deadlines, create all tally sheets for the clerk's folio, audit the folio at the close of the polls, ensure calculations are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13689.432s">Set</a>  up and maintain all tasks, including staff, instruction, training, poll pads, working with DPW for the setup of the polls. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13698.139s">Process</a>  on a daily basis all ballots cast during early voting through the VRIS state system. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13706.505s">Organize</a>  early tabulation and central tabulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13709.468s">Create</a>  spreadsheets and certification tabulation of elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13715.904s">You</a>  could see the importance, Mr. President, of having someone that would oversee this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13722.148s">And</a>  I think asking the city clerk, who already has a full plate, just from being city clerk and dealing with the council, to then also say, you're also in charge every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13734.237s">This</a>  is not every couple of years, every other year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13737.139s">Every</a>  year to run a major election in a city of our size, Mr. President, I think is asking for too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13744.364s">Most</a>  surrounding communities have an election coordinator, they have someone that's in charge of the election process, and it is not the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13754.406s">It</a>  is an additional role. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13756.407s">And</a>  I would ask Mr. President, in the interest of maintaining what I would say is fair elections in this community, maintaining a system that I think we all feel comfortable knowing that our system is a good system in the city of Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13771.69s">Does</a>  it need improvements? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13772.91s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13773.771s">Does</a>  it require additional staff like a coordinator? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13777.492s">Definitely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13779.052s">And</a>  we want to maintain the integrity of what we have, Mr. President, in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13784.514s">And</a>  I think that will go a long way to ensuring residents that in this new day and age, with probably the expansion of moving forward with voting, early voting, and voting by mail and so forth, it's only going to expand. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13801.059s">that</a>  we really need to make sure we have a state-of-the-art register of voters office. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13806.782s">We</a>  have great workers in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13808.983s">We</a>  have great women that have been in there for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13812.584s">They</a>  do terrific work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13814.965s">But</a>  I think it's time, Mr. President, that we connect everything together now and really go into the 21st century and provide the tools that we need for that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13825.19s">So</a>  again, I ask that the administration, Mr. President, because this was sent to the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13831.069s">The</a>  administration reflect upon this and the integrity of our elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13836.353s">And</a>  we have previous experience from the primary of what can potentially go wrong in an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13845.62s">And</a>  the fact that we need this assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13847.961s">This</a>  is not City Councilor Michael Mark saying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13850.743s">This</a>  is residents throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13852.985s">This</a>  is the city clerk himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13855.407s">And</a>  I think it's about time that we get a commitment from this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13861.263s">Mr.</a>  President, to put this position in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13864.287s">Whatever</a>  it takes to fund it, let's do it, let's move forward, and let's make sure we maintain the integrity of our electoral process in the city of Meffitt. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13874.382s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13874.843s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13876.585s">Vice</a>  President Carviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13877.878s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13878.659s">Mr.</a>  President, this is something that was supported by this whole council a couple of weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13883.622s">I</a>  mean, in about 40 days, we got one of the most important elections in our time coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13890.906s">And</a>  this is not the time to have the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13895.549s">be</a>  backpedaling on things that he needs to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13899.191s">We've</a>  seen that in the past election. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13902.592s">We're</a>  going to see it coming going forward in all future elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13905.993s">Again,</a>  this is not a one man job anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13908.474s">This</a>  is a position that needs to be filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13913.036s">Again,</a>  it's not a one day vote anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13916.477s">We</a>  now vote on five or six, seven days. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13920.279s">And</a>  again, we try to do this with volunteers and smoke and mirrors. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13926.555s">Well,</a>  those days are over. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13929.25s">It's</a>  about time the city steps up, as Councilor Monk said, and hires a full-time person to do this, and to bring our elections up to where they need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13939.994s">So</a>  again, I support Councilor Monk's on this, and I think all my other councilors, I think we're all feeling the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13947.696s">We</a>  got to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13948.956s">I</a>  don't know why we're waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13950.217s">They</a>  say we got 40 days, and in 40 days, you're going to have an election coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13954.238s">And</a>  we're still back at square one.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13958.677s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13959.298s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello, Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13961.721s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13962.522s">I</a>  don't want to beat a dead horse. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13963.604s">I</a>  think Councilor Marks and Councilor Carviello made a lot of good points. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13968.631s">If</a>  it was not 11 p.m., I might be a little more angry because I think we literally saw the city clerk <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13976.174s">physically</a>  change and feel the stress of working hundreds of hours in a very short amount of time to make an election work that we've never seen before. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13984.418s">And</a>  to be honest, the city clerk has been asking for this for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13987.579s">For</a>  years he's been asking for this to be in the budget from the mayor's office, and this man, the previous mayor, it just hasn't gotten in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13993.362s">They</a>  haven't put it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13994.342s">So</a>  it's not like we didn't see this coming down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13997.924s">Early</a>  voting, 10 days of early voting, is enshrined in law. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14001.545s">from</a>  now until forever for primary and the general election, so that's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14007.426s">Now</a>  we're gonna have mail ballots, maybe for a long time, maybe that'll be enshrined into law too. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14012.907s">There's</a>  a ballot question, we might have ranked choice voting, which might also add to the elections plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14018.288s">And</a>  just to make the point, this city clerk has put on four, by November, he will have put on four major elections in 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14026.99s">The</a>  municipal election, the presidential primary, the state and federal primary, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14031.151s">and</a>  the general election. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14032.031s">Four</a>  elections in 12 months without an elections coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14034.512s">So</a>  I'm a little angry that this hasn't been addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14038.794s">I'm</a>  a little angry that the clerk was kind of hung out to dry when he's been asking for this to be addressed for years and it hasn't been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14045.636s">So</a>  let's do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14049.497s">I</a>  don't know what else to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14050.497s">It</a>  needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14052.178s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14053.882s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Pierce. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14054.822s">Councilor</a>  Night?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14056.123s">Mr.</a>  President, I do remember, maybe, was it five weeks ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14061.846s">You</a>  sent an email out to the administration talking about $250,000 that was part of our agreement with cable, our cable agreement.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14074.233s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14075.223s">And</a>  I don't believe we ever got a response as to whether or not those funds were going to be appropriated or how they were going to be utilized, did we? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14084.502s">It</a>  was a form letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14086.663s">Similar</a>  to a form letter, if I'm not mistaken.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14088.144s">Yeah,</a>  there was a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14089.364s">It</a>  didn't say how the funds were going to be spent, but they were not included in the budget.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14093.987s">May</a>  I be so bold to suggest, Mr. President, that a portion of the $250,000 from the cable agreement be allotted for the purpose of hiring an election coordinator for the November general election? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14109.294s">And</a>  can I be so bold as to suggest that in the form of a amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14113.036s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14113.817s">Sounds</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14116.178s">I</a>  don't want to steal your thunder. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14117.058s">You're</a>  the guy that found the money, John, but let's spend it.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14119.539s">No,</a>  actually, I was thinking the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14121.24s">We're</a>  on the same page, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14124.541s">We're</a>  on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14127.343s">The</a>  money's there, and it should be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14132.185s">The</a>  administration should be meeting with the clerk to find out exactly what needs he has with regard to the upcoming election, and then long term, what they need to make sure that their office is stacked properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14145.675s">And</a>  all my colleagues have had great points. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14151.358s">We</a>  all agree on this, I think 100%, and that is that the clerk needs help. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14157.281s">And</a>  the demand to the job, I mean, it's always been a demanding job, but it's really demanding now with all the mail-in voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14164.984s">And</a>  early voting, I mean, the role has changed throughout the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14169.106s">There</a>  is money there, and that money should be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14171.967s">To</a>  me, that's a perfect place to actually spend the money, because this is going to have an impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14179.77s">And</a>  we need to make sure that that office is stacked properly for the upcoming election and long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14186.313s">for</a>  the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14187.254s">And</a>  I want to thank the clerk for all his hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14189.817s">I</a>  talk to him I think probably on a daily basis and I know he puts in a lot of time and a lot of hours and I know everyone in his office does as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14198.645s">So</a>  I thank them for all their hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14200.706s">Counselor</a>  Knight, I thank you for bringing that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14202.968s">Counselor</a>  Beers, I believe you had your hand up.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14204.73s">just</a>  as if I may, and not to step on your toes, I know for a fact that the clerk has made these asks directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14211.274s">It's</a>  not about meeting and asking what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14212.975s">The</a>  needs have been outlined, the asks have been made, and they are not being answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14216.898s">So</a>  it's just very frustrating.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14221.061s">It</a>  needs to be a priority, without a doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14223.342s">And</a>  I hope the administration looks at it as a priority as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14228.085s">So</a>  let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14229.646s">On</a>  the motion, make sure there's no one with their hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14236.834s">Okay,</a>  on the motion of Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14241.217s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14244.539s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor, Vice President Cabrillo. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14247.101s">Clerk</a>  Herterby, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14269.143s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14269.423s">Seven</a>  the affirmative, zero the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14270.763s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14271.763s">20-555</a>  offered by Councilor Marks being resolved at the most recent visit to Medford by Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pawlik be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14282.245s">Councilor</a>  Marks?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14286.926s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14288.466s">And</a>  even though it's late at night, I have the energy to be angry about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14294.387s">Let</a>  me tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14297.675s">It</a>  was great on September 10th, Mr. President, when I put on the local news and I saw the governor, the lieutenant governor, Secretary of Transportation Pollack, all in Bistro 5 in West Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14314.682s">The</a>  governor was there to talk about his daily or weekly COVID report. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14320.441s">And</a>  then they also found time, Mr. President, to discuss the outdoor dining, which I support 1,000%. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14329.771s">And</a>  also as part of this, Mr. President, Secretary Pollack <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14335.416s">mentioned</a>  about several projects that are going on in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14341.18s">One</a>  being complete streets, how we've received money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14345.243s">And</a>  I am thankful for the money, I'm thankful for the projects that have taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14350.347s">The</a>  other is the recent money we received from MassDOT regarding the shared streets and spaces grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14358.593s">And</a>  that is partly the reason why they were there to show how we're able now to do some outdoor dining and take some of the money to do heating ramps and cement barriers and anything else that would assist local entrepreneurs in the community to have additional seating during this COVID, which I support a thousand percent, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14385.451s">The</a>  one issue I do have, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14388.752s">The</a>  one issue I think everyone behind this real should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14392.494s">And</a>  if we had a real media in this community, there was a lot of media there, Mr. President, but they weren't locals. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14402.74s">The</a>  questions asked weren't locals. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14405.722s">If</a>  they invited the rest of us, and if the rest of us were able to get into that, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14412.051s">meeting</a>  as my colleague experienced for himself that attended and wasn't one of the lucky people to be able to attend the meeting and maybe ask a question or partake in the conference that was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14427.469s">But</a>  Mr. President, what has this council and the residents of this community have talked about and requested from MassDOT, Secretary of Transportation Pollack, for the last 20 years? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14440.518s">Although</a>  she hasn't been the secretary for that long, but she's been there for several years under this current administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14448.264s">One</a>  of the top three most dangerous intersections in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14457.233s">The</a>  corner of South Street and Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14460.775s">It's</a>  been a bone of contention since I've been on this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14466.438s">And</a>  here we have the Secretary of Transportation coming in and touting complete streets and mass DOT shared streets, which are great programs, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14479.687s">But</a>  no mention of a major issue, we've sent countless resolutions from this council to DOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14487.871s">We've</a>  sent it to the mayor, we've sent it to our state delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14491.153s">Councilor</a>  Scapelli has had countless meetings on this, requesting that signalization be placed at that intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14499.538s">That</a>  some low lying fruit be done, signage, painting of crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14507.975s">winding</a>  of curbs and sidewalks, traffic calming initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14515.677s">And</a>  to have the audacity, Mr. President, or maybe this doesn't make it to the secretary's desk when we request things as a city council on behalf of 60,000 people, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14529.399s">But</a>  I would think an issue of that importance should have been part of the discussion, whether it was during the press conference, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14538.038s">before</a>  the press conference, on the sidewalk, after the press conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14543.062s">But</a>  at some point, Mr. President, I would hope that this discussion around a two-decade-old public safety concern in this community needed to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14559.906s">And</a>  I can guarantee you it wasn't mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14563.028s">It</a>  didn't make the list, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14564.989s">They</a>  were just here to tell what they want to tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14570.293s">And</a>  not address the issues that we're talking about as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14577.277s">And</a>  South Street's just one, but it's a major one, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14583.461s">So</a>  as far as I'm concerned, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14586.095s">Next</a>  time we invite Secretary of Transportation Paul to the city of Method, she should come bearing several million dollars to do the signalization we need from Salem Street to Potter High Street to Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14605.168s">To</a>  finish off that corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14606.909s">That</a>  is not, that part of South and Main is not city property. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14611.993s">If</a>  it was, I'd be barking at the administration, I'd be barking at our traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14617.817s">We're</a>  building a brand new police station across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14622.441s">And</a>  you have to risk your life to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14627.004s">It</a>  really is a disgrace, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14631.035s">And</a>  it bothered me to see Secretary Pollack sit back and take kudos for some other projects that are warranted, and I support Mr. President, but to not address the 1,000 pound gorilla in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14649.43s">And</a>  if she wasn't advised of the letters we've been sending over the past 20 years, shame on her staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14656.936s">And</a>  shame on who's in charge there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14660.987s">I'd</a>  like to send a letter, Mr. President, from this council, and I hope the council will support it, to Secretary Pollack, thanking her for coming to the city of Method on September 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14673.718s">And</a>  thanking her for her work on complete streets and the shared streets and spaces grant program. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14682.064s">However,</a>  Mr. President, I want to know what's happening at the corner of South and Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14691.65s">And</a>  I want to know why we haven't received a thorough response from the Department of Transportation that addresses the public safety concerns of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14701.536s">You</a>  know how many accidents have been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14703.237s">I</a>  brought this up about six, seven, eight weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14706.078s">I</a>  got the statistics from the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14708.7s">And</a>  when I say in the top three accident related and most dangerous intersections, I didn't create that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14714.223s">That</a>  was from his data that he presented to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14718.045s">That</a>  was directly from his data. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14720.998s">So</a>  this is not a pie in the sky or a wish list. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14724.359s">This</a>  is a public safety concern, and we've all addressed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14728.481s">We've</a>  all addressed it a million times, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14730.742s">So</a>  I respectfully request that the city clerk draft a letter on behalf of the Memphis City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14739.437s">requesting</a>  that Secretary Pollack address, once again, the request of this council about what are they going to do regarding the intersection, the state road, the intersection of South and Main Street, in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14758.108s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14851.243s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14852.104s">I</a>  was approached by a number of residents in the city of Method that had concern regarding state regulated and licensed halfway homes within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14862.757s">I</a>  did a little additional research and some past history I have working <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14870.667s">with</a>  residents regarding a previous halfway house that existed in the Wellington area. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14876.973s">I</a>  found some information that I think people would be surprised about when the state regulates and licenses halfway homes within the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14888.023s">There</a>  is zero notification to cities and towns, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14894.206s">There</a>  are zero regulations on our books regarding halfway homes within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14902.072s">There</a>  are zero zoning ordinances regarding halfway houses in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14908.277s">And</a>  I put this forward, Mr. President, as chapter 111B of the Mass General Law section 6A that the Board of Health regulates halfway homes within the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14920.667s">And</a>  I put it on that we have a round table discussion with Chief Buckley, with our state delegation, our building commissioner, our city solicitor, to make sure, Mr. President, that we have rules and regulations within our community, Mr. President, that safeguard our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14944.671s">And</a>  there was an unfortunate incident that took place a few weeks back. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14949.392s">Thank</a>  God a resident came out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14954.493s">All</a>  right, Mr. President, but it could have went very different, very, very different. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14960.434s">And</a>  there was some concern regarding this particular incident and that this particular issue of halfway homes within our community needs to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14975.213s">I'm</a>  not saying we have to eliminate, which I don't believe we can, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14979.995s">But</a>  I believe, as Councilman Knight mentioned, knowledge is power. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14984.737s">And</a>  I think that we should have the knowledge when a halfway home is licensed in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14993.271s">And</a>  that at the very least, we should be on notice, Mr. President, on how we should protect residents that may be living within proximity of these particular homes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15009.731s">I</a>  offer that in a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15011.133s">I</a>  would ask, I know you have a million things as committee of the whole, Mr. President, but I would ask at some point we create a committee of the whole meeting to address this very important issue on behalf of the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15026.633s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15158.206s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15159.867s">I</a>  think I saw on Councilor Morell posted today that the city is around 71.2% or 71.8% response rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15172.137s">That's</a>  28% short of where we need to be in terms of having a full count in this 2020 census. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15179.683s">We</a>  are eight days away from the end of the census now that the Trump administration has shortened the time that the census will occur. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15188.73s">I</a>  mean, to be completely honest, talking to census experts, there's a deep concern that this entire census process will be flawed, but given that it's entirely possible that it will be certified and be the official result, the goal of this is to <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15204.418s">ask</a>  the city administration, say we were at 72 or 75 or 80%, and I'm leaving that up to them, what would the impact of that low response rate be in terms of any federal funding, state funding, and other ways that we are bound by the census in the different funding streams that we have for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15226.391s">So</a>  that's the intent here, and I would move approval.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15510.623s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15511.804s">Um,</a>  this resolution is pretty self explanatory, but this was raised through a number of channels that because of the, uh, indoor gathering limits, um, and another number of other limits, a lot of, uh, recovery meetings have essentially kind of disappeared or stopped happening during the state emergency orders in a pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15528.681s">This</a>  is, you know, some, um, organizations don't have zoom licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15533.605s">Some</a>  are at the mercy of the <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15535.647s">where</a>  the meetings are usually held and they're not reopening just yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15538.989s">So</a>  I did reach out to the outreach and prevention team and they're aware of this issue and they did offer that they would do everything in their power to support 12-step programs that are seeking to meet as long as they follow state orders. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15551.296s">But</a>  I did just want to raise this to ensure that this is top of mind for the administration and they're doing all they can to support local <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15557.279s">who</a>  are in recovery and seeking recovery right now because it's really making a massive impact on these meetings and people seeking help. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15565.318s">So</a>  I move approval.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15569.585s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15570.506s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15600.333s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15601.973s">Councilor</a>  Layton.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15602.914s">Mr.</a>  President, I thank the councilors for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15607.174s">I'd</a>  also, I think it's very important that we recognize the work of our Substance Abuse and Prevention Office and where they've come in such a short time since being created. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15618.397s">The</a>  office has only been in effect now for maybe what, five years, six years? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15622.998s">And</a>  the strides that they've made in this community in terms of education and outreach have been <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15629.099s">enumerable</a>  compared to where we were before to where we are today, the level of services that we offer as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15637.341s">But</a>  I think it's also important, Mr. President, to recognize that in the spirit of National Recovery Month, that this is a resolution that we must support this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15646.804s">And</a>  I wholeheartedly will vote entirely in favor of it this evening.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15651.045s">Thank</a>  you very much, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15652.786s">Any</a>  other questions or comments from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15656.567s">We</a>  have, let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15664.615s">And</a>  that name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15666.676s">14</a>  drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15668.596s">speak</a>  to this because I am in recovery. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15693.271s">It's</a>  very strange to me that we would be just a couple of minutes ago, looking to figure out how to not have empathy for people in halfway houses and people who don't have enough money to move into an apartment who live in boarding houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15711.941s">And</a>  to keep those people out while we're pretending to support people that are in recovery.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_39]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15722.317s">So,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15724.638s">Um,</a>  part of console marks.</p>
