1
00:00:00,553 --> 00:00:08,977
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, welcome to the Medford Charter Study Final Report Subcommittee Meeting, July 29th, 2024.

2
00:00:11,118 --> 00:00:12,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Did everyone have a chance to review the minutes?

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

4
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:17,562
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make a motion to accept those.

5
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:18,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

6
00:00:19,262 --> 00:00:19,863
[SPEAKER_02]: All in favor?

7
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:22,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

8
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:24,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

9
00:00:25,486 --> 00:00:29,348
[SPEAKER_02]: So, basically, we're just, I mean, thank you, Gene,

10
00:00:31,712 --> 00:00:36,715
[SPEAKER_02]: those recommendation sections and also for your comments.

11
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:43,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I went through some of the drafts that I had written and made changes, so that was really helpful.

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're in good shape on that.

14
00:00:48,222 --> 00:00:52,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any questions or comments about what you did, Gene or Maury?

15
00:00:52,284 --> 00:00:57,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I did have a question, but Maury, did you have any thoughts or questions?

16
00:00:57,207 --> 00:00:57,347
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.

17
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:57,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.

18
00:00:57,687 --> 00:00:58,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice job.

19
00:00:59,147 --> 00:00:59,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

20
00:01:00,388 --> 00:01:03,349
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to provide demographics from the survey.

21
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:03,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

22
00:01:05,951 --> 00:01:18,838
[SPEAKER_01]: In the community engagement section, because I feel like that would help respond to people's, the criticisms I've heard that it's not reflective of, and if it's not reflective, that's fine.

23
00:01:18,898 --> 00:01:22,420
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we're in a better position if we say it up front, you know.

24
00:01:23,642 --> 00:01:26,525
[SPEAKER_01]: So was David doing an analysis?

25
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:29,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I need to figure out how to get in touch with David.

26
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:36,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, he said he was going to be around all summer, but he hasn't been responsive.

27
00:01:36,773 --> 00:01:39,415
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have to try to get in touch with him.

28
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:43,239
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have like the, I mean,

29
00:01:45,213 --> 00:01:46,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I can find them.

30
00:01:47,355 --> 00:01:47,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

31
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:48,756
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have the data.

32
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:49,937
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a question.

33
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,818
[SPEAKER_02]: He was going to make a survey report.

34
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:53,320
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we asked him to do.

35
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

36
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:57,123
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could do the analysis myself.

37
00:01:57,203 --> 00:01:58,684
[SPEAKER_01]: It would take time.

38
00:01:59,164 --> 00:01:59,465
Okay.

39
00:01:59,545 --> 00:02:03,368
[SPEAKER_01]: And if he's already doing it, I thought, well, then I don't need to.

40
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:04,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

41
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:07,711
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's good.

42
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:13,456
[SPEAKER_02]: So we should connect with Javid and see exactly what he's going to do.

43
00:02:16,446 --> 00:02:27,510
[SPEAKER_02]: If David is unable to do the survey, he already created something for us that did not include the demographics that he shared at a meeting.

44
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:31,051
[SPEAKER_01]: At a full meeting?

45
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:34,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, at the full meeting.

46
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:34,973
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a while back.

47
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:37,034
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have missed that.

48
00:02:37,294 --> 00:02:38,134
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll look into that.

49
00:02:38,154 --> 00:02:39,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we have

50
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:47,573
[SPEAKER_02]: the demographic pie charts, right, that the survey created?

51
00:02:47,593 --> 00:02:49,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we do?

52
00:02:49,373 --> 00:02:49,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

53
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:56,436
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I downloaded because I remember seeing the I thought the V was gonna put that all together.

54
00:02:57,556 --> 00:02:59,097
[SPEAKER_02]: He's Yeah, we have to check with them.

55
00:02:59,717 --> 00:02:59,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

56
00:03:00,017 --> 00:03:03,719
[SPEAKER_02]: But there but Google, you know, Google surveys,

57
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,306
[SPEAKER_02]: did create pie charts.

58
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:08,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it in the survey folder?

59
00:03:08,727 --> 00:03:09,768
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.

60
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:13,030
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it might just be in the survey results.

61
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And it didn't get pulled.

62
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:15,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't.

63
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:16,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, jeez.

64
00:03:17,112 --> 00:03:17,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that really?

65
00:03:17,993 --> 00:03:19,754
[SPEAKER_02]: This must be new.

66
00:03:20,414 --> 00:03:20,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

67
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:23,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to minimize so I could look in the.

68
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:26,898
[SPEAKER_02]: They said I can't minimize Zoom while I'm recording.

69
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:28,599
[SPEAKER_02]: That's never happened to me before.

70
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:30,720
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be a new thing.

71
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:39,809
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so I'll look and see, because the other person, Danielle, created the survey.

72
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:45,134
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a certain way you can look at the survey results.

73
00:03:45,154 --> 00:03:48,096
[SPEAKER_02]: And whenever I would look at the results, I would see the pie charts.

74
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:50,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume it didn't go away.

75
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,292
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to download an Excel spreadsheet with all the results.

76
00:03:59,392 --> 00:04:00,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

77
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:07,594
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not the owner of the survey, so I don't know that I can see that.

78
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:12,175
[SPEAKER_02]: The person who could see it is Danielle.

79
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:12,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

80
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:18,816
[SPEAKER_02]: But I should be able to see it because I think she gave me access to it, so I'm just trying to look for it right now.

81
00:04:18,896 --> 00:04:21,297
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have that, that's fine because then I can just say,

82
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:31,453
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 10% were, you know, 40% were renters or you know, whatever, because I think yeah, exactly.

83
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:42,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Compare that to like Medford demographics if we have that and just to yeah, so we'll talk about how representative it is.

84
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:49,069
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I see what's in the folder is just the Excel spreadsheet.

85
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:49,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

86
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:55,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I know they exist because I saw them.

87
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:57,674
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me ask Danielle about that.

88
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:11,938
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be a special way that I can maybe dig up the link she gave me a long time ago to look at the survey results, but I'll ask her.

89
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:16,199
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

90
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:19,220
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other important thing,

91
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:32,015
[SPEAKER_02]: to remember about that demographics info is that it include the percentage of people, I think it's in the pie chart, who said they didn't want to answer.

92
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:34,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

93
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:35,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

94
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:40,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some people, because remember, we had prefer not to answer as an option.

95
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:40,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

96
00:05:41,902 --> 00:05:43,724
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's in the pie chart.

97
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,787
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

98
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:59,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so Jen, did you have any other questions about or thoughts about what you put together?

99
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:15,903
[SPEAKER_01]: No, with the Article 8, you know, citizen participation, I just did it broadly and I didn't, you know, go through each one or what it does.

100
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:19,446
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's how we talked about presenting it.

101
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, definitely.

102
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:22,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

103
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:23,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

104
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:32,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and that one in particular was sort of challenging because it had all those different parts.

105
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:35,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

106
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,382
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just, you know.

107
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:53,116
[SPEAKER_01]: said they include X, Y, Z, and then talked about the requirement that at the ballot, you need to show that you have at least 20 or 25% of the registered voters participating for it to be valid.

108
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:57,518
[SPEAKER_02]: So- I think, yeah, I think that's okay for that one.

109
00:06:57,538 --> 00:06:57,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

110
00:06:58,298 --> 00:06:59,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it is pretty,

111
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:21,194
[SPEAKER_02]: thick when you get into the- I mean, you could break it down and say, do different recommendations for each one, but I think it makes sense to group them together.

112
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:22,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's fine.

113
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

114
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:34,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if we broke them up, it would be like the referendum, the free petition,

115
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:41,416
[SPEAKER_02]: citizen initiative measures, citizen referendum measures, and then recall.

116
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:43,096
[SPEAKER_02]: There would be like four, right?

117
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:49,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you might want to lump citizen initiative and referendum together.

118
00:07:49,298 --> 00:07:49,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

119
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:56,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think they have the same numbers, but then the referendum has different numbers.

120
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:59,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

121
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's worth doing that since recall is

122
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:09,719
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be seen maybe as different than those things, but I don't know.

123
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,399
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think, Maury?

124
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,960
[SPEAKER_00]: I think recall should be by itself.

125
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

126
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:24,143
[SPEAKER_00]: We can keep the other three grouped the way it is, it's fine, but I think I'd pull recall out of there and just make it a separate line item and

127
00:08:27,097 --> 00:08:29,058
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be linking it with everything else.

128
00:08:29,438 --> 00:08:33,020
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a horse of a different color, you know what I'm saying, by itself.

129
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

130
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,041
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think that's a good point.

131
00:08:37,102 --> 00:08:37,422
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

132
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:39,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you mind doing that?

133
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,204
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I can rewrite that.

134
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:42,864
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll just have two.

135
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:46,266
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have like citizen initiative and then recall.

136
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:46,866
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

137
00:08:47,387 --> 00:08:47,907
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.

138
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:48,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

139
00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:49,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

140
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:51,008
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

141
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,470
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we're in pretty good shape.

142
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:55,931
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?

143
00:08:57,055 --> 00:09:19,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done a little bit, but I need to do more on putting all that public comment that we've collected with the survey and through emails into the issue sheets, that Google sheet, because we figured that that would be the easiest way to include it in the final report.

144
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Say that again, Milva?

145
00:09:22,454 --> 00:09:23,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

146
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:26,017
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a bunch of public comment.

147
00:09:26,177 --> 00:09:30,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the survey also gave people the opportunity to write, right?

148
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:43,350
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, and you know, I mean, they're all kind of hard to access because they're in that Excel spreadsheet.

149
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:49,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to put them into the Google issue sheet under this under, you know, which,

150
00:09:50,047 --> 00:10:01,589
[SPEAKER_02]: would represent a good amount of work, but it seemed like sort of the best way to give, to put that public comment into the final report was to have it consolidated into that issue sheets.

151
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and have a link instead of attaching the issue sheet.

152
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:07,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

153
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:10,071
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a link to all the comment, like email.

154
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:11,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

155
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:19,113
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe, do you think maybe if the public comments from the survey can be exported,

156
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:31,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can just, I've never exported from, I don't know what the, it seems like there probably is a way to export them, right?

157
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:38,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's waiting comments received from the survey over all the other comments.

158
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:39,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.

159
00:10:39,816 --> 00:10:44,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Though I don't like highlighting those and not highlighting

160
00:10:45,078 --> 00:11:02,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, public comment we got via email or other means like if I yeah, no, I was just thinking maybe you do you set up a link with with all different categories, whatever it is, and they can access if they want to see public comments, or if they want to see public emails, or they want.

161
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:05,110
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all there on one link and what's.

162
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:09,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that was the idea of the issue sheets.

163
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:13,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just thinking of a way to lighten the workload, because transferring all those.

164
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:14,592
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can do it.

165
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:15,233
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do it.

166
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:16,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want help?

167
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:18,355
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can help you.

168
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:19,536
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

169
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,338
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start it and see how it goes.

170
00:11:21,858 --> 00:11:22,779
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, thanks.

171
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,681
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on vacation for like 10 days, mid-August.

172
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:26,022
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

173
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:31,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

174
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:42,443
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there were a few comments that were sort of frivolous, and I don't know how we feel about, like, if we just make a judgment call, then I'll put those in the issue sheets.

175
00:11:44,044 --> 00:11:45,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's fine.

176
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:50,849
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, like, another category, but if they're not at all relevant, I don't think they should be included.

177
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:51,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

178
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:51,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

179
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:51,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

180
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,521
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what you're doing about fixing Mystic Avenue or something like that.

181
00:11:58,561 --> 00:11:59,522
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not relevant.

182
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:00,242
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

183
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:00,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

184
00:12:01,162 --> 00:12:01,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

185
00:12:01,682 --> 00:12:02,082
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

186
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,343
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds good.

187
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:20,027
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, the main things we have to do now are put together the append, just sort of do this little bit of revision on sections, put together the appendix, which I started a folder and put the materials in it.

188
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:21,648
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to figure out how to structure it.

189
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:27,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I keep forgetting that I can't minimize anymore.

190
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:32,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you all see the appendix holder?

191
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, what's in there now?

192
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:40,878
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's probably more that needs to go in there.

193
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:52,146
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we could just, I don't know, have you ever made an appendix, Gene?

194
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:54,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what style?

195
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:56,743
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really have to follow any particular style.

196
00:12:59,024 --> 00:13:11,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I use Word and use their headings and a table of contents.

197
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:20,793
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a table of contents for the whole report, but also a table of contents for the appendix because the appendix is going to be a lot of stuff in there.

198
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:30,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can put that in your main table of contents and then add links, click on it, and it'll take you to the sections if you use.

199
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:40,090
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you end up format, like doing formatting the whole thing and putting the table of contents in, will you do the appendix too?

200
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:45,232
[SPEAKER_02]: That means you would decide how to organize the appendix, which is fine.

201
00:13:47,624 --> 00:14:06,094
[SPEAKER_02]: There aren't a lot of references to the appendix, but I did make a couple in the introductory letter, right, where I said I referenced a Collins Center memo and the generic modern charter, and then I just put appendix number or whatever.

202
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:06,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how.

203
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:10,137
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of like a footnote, but not exactly.

204
00:14:10,157 --> 00:14:15,700
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do the appendix in the order they're referenced in the document.

205
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:17,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

206
00:14:18,318 --> 00:14:21,219
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, or by section.

207
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:22,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

208
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,921
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now we'll just keep collecting.

209
00:14:25,521 --> 00:14:34,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the footnotes is the other thing.

210
00:14:37,706 --> 00:14:42,869
[SPEAKER_02]: The footnotes are going to be before, maybe at the very end after the appendix.

211
00:14:46,805 --> 00:14:51,687
[SPEAKER_01]: I had put them in the, let's see, I put mine in the, I think I had one footnote.

212
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:53,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you put them within the recommendations.

213
00:14:54,188 --> 00:14:54,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

214
00:14:55,188 --> 00:14:57,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's probably makes more, that, that makes more sense.

215
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:58,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

216
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I will footnote my recommendations too.

217
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:02,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

218
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,014
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we don't have to have footnotes at the end.

219
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:11,215
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

220
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:12,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

221
00:15:12,255 --> 00:15:12,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

222
00:15:15,737 --> 00:15:15,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

223
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:29,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else that we were, that I mean, that we're supposed to, the call-in center offered to read the final report too.

224
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:34,686
[SPEAKER_02]: So should we, should I just throw it together now in draft form and send it to them?

225
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:36,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe in case.

226
00:15:37,348 --> 00:15:37,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

227
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I mean, you can just send them the link to the folder or something.

228
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:43,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

229
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:53,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go through and clean up, because I see people made edits, so that it's cleaner.

230
00:15:53,444 --> 00:16:03,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to go through any of the edits?

231
00:16:05,927 --> 00:16:07,888
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think there were any.

232
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,590
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you gave, like I had questions for you, like what languages?

233
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

234
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I told you that, right?

235
00:16:18,582 --> 00:16:19,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

236
00:16:19,023 --> 00:16:24,007
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't see any ones that we need to discuss.

237
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:25,068
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

238
00:16:28,451 --> 00:16:30,292
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good that you put that in there.

239
00:16:30,672 --> 00:16:35,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked Frances, but I haven't heard back yet about the translations.

240
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,479
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know I have a bunch of the handouts.

241
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,582
[SPEAKER_02]: There must be electronic versions of them.

242
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:49,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Frances would have those because I only ever, we only ever got the hard copies.

243
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:50,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the hard copies.

244
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:52,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose I could scan one.

245
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,027
[SPEAKER_01]: To put in the appendix or?

246
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:56,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

247
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:58,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to put them in the appendix?

248
00:16:58,388 --> 00:16:59,009
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

249
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:05,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, because we, we talk, did we talk about, do we need to put our flyer in the appendix?

250
00:17:07,055 --> 00:17:07,575
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

251
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:11,538
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't, I'm, I don't know.

252
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:14,100
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like you don't want to just put a ton of stuff in there.

253
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

254
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:15,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

255
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:21,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, so maybe we just say that we did translation so we don't include all that stuff.

256
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,744
[SPEAKER_02]: The flyers and the glossary, we had a glossary that was translated also.

257
00:17:29,786 --> 00:17:31,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, okay, so.

258
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:38,584
[SPEAKER_01]: A glossary with key terms?

259
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:40,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

260
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:47,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I have them in the ad that I used to bring to all our events.

261
00:17:48,506 --> 00:17:49,406
[SPEAKER_02]: They're downstairs.

262
00:17:49,906 --> 00:17:50,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

263
00:17:50,886 --> 00:18:04,609
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we have flyers in different languages and then we have the glossary, which was just basic because remember we talked about how people wouldn't necessarily know even what a charter is or what word representation is and things like that.

264
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:11,615
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just, yeah.

265
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:22,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

266
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:28,791
[SPEAKER_01]: I see in the Article 6, you had a question.

267
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you did have a couple comments maybe we should talk about the you don't.

268
00:18:35,343 --> 00:18:36,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, that's right.

269
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:39,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the annual meeting.

270
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:42,828
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was an ordinance or that they were creating an ordinance.

271
00:18:42,848 --> 00:18:49,793
[SPEAKER_02]: They did create an ordinance and the ordinance has been passed, but I don't know that that annual meeting is part of it.

272
00:18:54,570 --> 00:19:09,354
[SPEAKER_02]: But isn't okay, so I could I mean there's a bunch of there's Yeah, there's a whole timeline in the budget ordinance for Different things but a meeting an annual meeting with all the branches of government.

273
00:19:09,434 --> 00:19:21,697
[SPEAKER_01]: I I'm not sure that's it Okay And then you want wanted to know whether we should list the reasons we declined to adopt the

274
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:23,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

275
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:25,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Budget lines.

276
00:19:27,195 --> 00:19:27,795
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?

277
00:19:34,598 --> 00:19:39,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we could say that as it's prohibited by state law.

278
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,022
[SPEAKER_01]: If we do that, should we cite it?

279
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:45,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

280
00:19:45,922 --> 00:19:51,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to know all these numbers off the top of my head, but I'll find it.

281
00:19:52,535 --> 00:19:54,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, might do it as a footnote.

282
00:19:55,576 --> 00:19:56,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that works.

283
00:19:57,257 --> 00:19:59,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I would footnote it.

284
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:00,958
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the right way to go.

285
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,159
Okay.

286
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll find it.

287
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,061
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find it.

288
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

289
00:20:09,682 --> 00:20:11,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I can find it pretty easily.

290
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:12,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

291
00:20:14,984 --> 00:20:16,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that's good.

292
00:20:18,646 --> 00:20:19,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And then

293
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:26,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else is pretty, like I, did I have any questions?

294
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Introductory now, article two, yeah.

295
00:20:35,563 --> 00:20:37,604
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we end up, Bilba, on the?

296
00:20:38,827 --> 00:20:39,187
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethics.

297
00:20:39,428 --> 00:20:42,810
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we end up on that?

298
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:43,791
[SPEAKER_02]: We're voting.

299
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:46,993
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about it and vote on it on Thursday.

300
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:47,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday.

301
00:20:47,874 --> 00:20:48,334
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.

302
00:20:48,354 --> 00:20:48,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

303
00:20:48,654 --> 00:20:49,455
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

304
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,998
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that's what we did, but I wasn't sure because it's been so much.

305
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:53,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

306
00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:54,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

307
00:20:57,104 --> 00:21:23,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, I was just reading over this the wardrobe is the article to when I was trying to I was thinking it would be good to put stats in about because I said It's the smallest in the state for a city of our size and if I could find exactly, you know, how many I think there's only two others And and you know the numbers on at-large versus Ward and then

308
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:36,655
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid, I don't know, I was thinking maybe of trying to find the stats on those, but I'm not sure how easy it will be to find them.

309
00:21:38,456 --> 00:21:49,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, municipalities are sort of independent and I don't, the only organization I feel like that would keep those stats is the Massachusetts Municipal Association.

310
00:21:49,862 --> 00:21:52,703
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I could look there, I'll look there.

311
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:57,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

312
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't we have a table with all 351 cities?

313
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:00,892
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

314
00:22:00,912 --> 00:22:02,794
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a table with just about 50-60 cities.

315
00:22:02,814 --> 00:22:03,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

316
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:03,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, yeah.

317
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:27,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's weird because there's some places, because the city town thing, like Framingham just became a city, right?

318
00:22:28,283 --> 00:22:35,946
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some towns that are probably really cities, but they haven't decided to call themselves cities yet.

319
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:48,771
[SPEAKER_02]: But mostly we were trying to compare municipalities that were more like us as opposed to, because towns will have

320
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:50,222
[SPEAKER_02]: town meeting.

321
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:56,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you prepare that or did Collins Center prepare it?

322
00:22:56,607 --> 00:22:59,590
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I actually found that.

323
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:02,593
[SPEAKER_02]: It was prepared by problem.

324
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:04,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know exactly who prepared it.

325
00:23:06,476 --> 00:23:15,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it off the Somerville Charter Study website, their materials, and then I double-checked each one.

326
00:23:16,723 --> 00:23:35,431
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really hard actually because sometimes the websites aren't up to date and when you look online for a charter to check and make sure that the composition is what that chart said, sometimes the charters online aren't the most, so I did it to the best of my ability.

327
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:42,695
[SPEAKER_02]: But Somerville's committee had two part-time employees, so I'm guessing they put it together.

328
00:23:43,935 --> 00:23:45,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's probably who put it together.

329
00:23:47,351 --> 00:23:52,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anyone wants to get in the weeds on it, but it'd be nice to provide to someone if they wanted to.

330
00:23:52,713 --> 00:23:54,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

331
00:23:54,594 --> 00:24:02,076
[SPEAKER_01]: At other cities and towns just to see where Medford stands and look at the data themselves.

332
00:24:02,597 --> 00:24:03,417
[SPEAKER_01]: It is useful.

333
00:24:04,397 --> 00:24:09,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, it's hard sometimes to keep it updated.

334
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,440
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was looking up,

335
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:13,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I wanted to double check everything.

336
00:24:13,888 --> 00:24:20,812
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were some cities that said, or one or two, I think it was Brockton, that said four-year term for mayor.

337
00:24:20,852 --> 00:24:22,954
[SPEAKER_02]: When I looked in their charter, it said two-year.

338
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:30,138
[SPEAKER_02]: And their charter hadn't been updated on the website or something.

339
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:33,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was very recent that they switched to four year.

340
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:38,833
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm actually unclear on whether some places could switch to four year with that.

341
00:24:38,893 --> 00:24:43,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's so many processes that are involved.

342
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:48,418
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our laws have not been updated in the last couple of years because we don't have a city solicitor.

343
00:24:50,244 --> 00:24:51,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

344
00:24:51,585 --> 00:24:58,331
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the things that have been passed have not been put on our website because they want to review them before.

345
00:24:58,391 --> 00:25:00,312
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe that's in other cities that.

346
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:01,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

347
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:02,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

348
00:25:02,674 --> 00:25:02,714
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

349
00:25:04,756 --> 00:25:07,859
[SPEAKER_02]: So so I think it's pretty accurate, but, you know.

350
00:25:10,461 --> 00:25:16,065
[SPEAKER_02]: We maybe could include it with the caveat that that it was created in 20, you know.

351
00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:19,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, when did I do it?

352
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably, yeah, we could put a date on it.

353
00:25:24,164 --> 00:25:24,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

354
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:25,646
[SPEAKER_02]: We could include it.

355
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:27,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it's mostly accurate.

356
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:30,091
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be a couple of things that are changed.

357
00:25:31,732 --> 00:25:38,439
[SPEAKER_02]: But it still gives the sense of, it shows you kind of visually, oh, wow, look.

358
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:45,578
[SPEAKER_02]: We're only one of a few that don't have ward representation.

359
00:25:45,598 --> 00:25:47,678
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows you the size of the councils.

360
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:49,819
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows you the size of the school committees.

361
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was really helpful.

362
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

363
00:25:54,781 --> 00:26:03,063
[SPEAKER_02]: And even the ward representation, there's only a few cities that don't have it, and Cambridge is one of them, which this isn't in the chart, of course.

364
00:26:03,204 --> 00:26:07,365
[SPEAKER_02]: But Cambridge has ranked choice voting, which, you know,

365
00:26:09,594 --> 00:26:18,699
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though they have at large, they also have a process that kind of mitigates the potential issues.

366
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:30,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Because interestingly, in the Lowell lawsuit, in the settlement, one of the options for Lowell was to go to rank choice voting.

367
00:26:31,226 --> 00:26:34,688
[SPEAKER_02]: They said either ward representation or rank choice voting.

368
00:26:35,946 --> 00:26:39,189
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did the word representation.

369
00:26:42,872 --> 00:26:43,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was interesting.

370
00:26:44,513 --> 00:26:47,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

371
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:50,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so maybe we'll put that in the appendix.

372
00:26:50,758 --> 00:26:51,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put it in there.

373
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:55,141
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put it in the appendix folder.

374
00:26:55,161 --> 00:27:01,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like a link to it, because people might want to... Yeah, I don't know.

375
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:01,647
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.

376
00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:04,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not that big.

377
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:05,859
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a huge document.

378
00:27:05,879 --> 00:27:07,000
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an Excel file.

379
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:19,047
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're putting together the appendix, then can you just choose to put some of the things in as links and some of them as whatever?

380
00:27:19,247 --> 00:27:19,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

381
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:19,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

382
00:27:20,668 --> 00:27:21,509
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to, like,

383
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:26,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Change access to the ones we want to share.

384
00:27:26,598 --> 00:27:27,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

385
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:27,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

386
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe.

387
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:32,145
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I need, does the owner have to do that?

388
00:27:32,705 --> 00:27:33,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

389
00:27:33,707 --> 00:27:35,769
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I need to do that, you can just let me know.

390
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:36,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

391
00:27:38,432 --> 00:27:39,854
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll put it in the folder for now.

392
00:27:41,335 --> 00:27:41,796
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know,

393
00:27:43,174 --> 00:27:51,136
[SPEAKER_02]: If the time comes when we're making the appendix and we decide, you know what, we don't really need this in the appendix, we can just not include it.

394
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:55,538
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now, we'll just lean on putting things in the folder that we think we might include.

395
00:27:57,118 --> 00:27:59,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we have a lot of materials.

396
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:04,020
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.

397
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're pretty good.

398
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:10,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else we need to do?

399
00:28:12,138 --> 00:28:12,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so.

400
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:16,801
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to decide when we're going to give it to the committee.

401
00:28:17,942 --> 00:28:25,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it now my turn to put in, am I putting it in a full document or is Daveed doing that or?

402
00:28:26,187 --> 00:28:26,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Putting what?

403
00:28:28,088 --> 00:28:29,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Merging it all into one report.

404
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I doing that now?

405
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,431
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.

406
00:28:32,471 --> 00:28:37,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are we letting people, like do you want the call-in center, let people edit it first?

407
00:28:39,126 --> 00:28:51,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like, I'm going to give the Collins Center a draft version, and I was going to just throw it in a document for them, but that won't be the final document, whatever you, because you're going to figure out how to put it in, so you can format it right and stuff.

408
00:28:52,494 --> 00:28:57,957
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to do that, because we, because the other thing we have to do is share it with the committee, with the wider committee.

409
00:28:57,977 --> 00:28:59,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

410
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:07,622
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can either, we can do that now, we can share the folder with them, and they can just look at it in pieces, or we can put it all together.

411
00:29:08,063 --> 00:29:08,523
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

412
00:29:09,732 --> 00:29:13,573
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have time now, so I could try to put it in a file.

413
00:29:13,673 --> 00:29:13,893
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

414
00:29:15,294 --> 00:29:16,714
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be great.

415
00:29:19,295 --> 00:29:20,275
[SPEAKER_01]: See how far I can get.

416
00:29:21,196 --> 00:29:22,156
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

417
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:27,678
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I would like, let's see.

418
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:35,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just thinking about just the stuff that has to be little changes.

419
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

420
00:29:42,831 --> 00:29:47,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like the stuff that's in highlighted, would you just keep the highlights or?

421
00:29:47,032 --> 00:29:47,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

422
00:29:47,992 --> 00:29:48,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

423
00:29:49,152 --> 00:29:50,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we.

424
00:29:51,093 --> 00:29:54,254
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we don't work in this anymore and we work in that document.

425
00:29:57,235 --> 00:30:03,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the one thing about Google Docs and Word, they don't play nice always.

426
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:05,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Just FYI.

427
00:30:09,122 --> 00:30:14,623
[SPEAKER_01]: As a consultant, most of my stuff I'm doing with Teams because that's a Microsoft product.

428
00:30:15,904 --> 00:30:16,844
[SPEAKER_01]: It acts a little better.

429
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:20,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Just know that.

430
00:30:20,905 --> 00:30:21,865
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a warning.

431
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:27,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can still do it this way.

432
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:30,647
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean some of the comments might not transfer?

433
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:33,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the formatting, it gets all,

434
00:30:35,037 --> 00:30:37,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Messed up, we can see.

435
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the footnotes, you can't see the footnotes.

436
00:30:40,821 --> 00:30:42,483
[SPEAKER_01]: They disappear, but they're there.

437
00:30:42,503 --> 00:30:59,275
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't always, perhaps purposefully, they don't always... I could make it a PDF and then put it up, but then it's hard to edit.

438
00:31:00,455 --> 00:31:00,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways.

439
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:10,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm just wondering, I mean, in one sense, it makes sense for you to do it now in case you have to sort of make changes and whatnot.

440
00:31:10,978 --> 00:31:18,860
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the other hand, if we need to keep working on it, should we wait until we're done with the edits?

441
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

442
00:31:20,261 --> 00:31:20,781
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

443
00:31:24,442 --> 00:31:24,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Hm.

444
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:27,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean.

445
00:31:29,247 --> 00:31:34,031
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like to give the full committee one document to look at and not sections.

446
00:31:34,511 --> 00:31:34,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that?

447
00:31:34,872 --> 00:31:41,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's okay to give the committee, you know, to tell them to just go into the folder and look at the different sections.

448
00:31:41,957 --> 00:31:42,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's okay.

449
00:31:43,118 --> 00:31:43,979
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think, Maury?

450
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think so too.

451
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:51,365
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, soon to be like a lot of maybe extra work.

452
00:31:51,385 --> 00:31:57,010
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to do work that's already been done to try to put it together on one whole draft form just for the committee.

453
00:31:57,722 --> 00:32:05,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because if it's going to maybe create potential issues for our final editing and stuff to move it now, then maybe we should wait.

454
00:32:06,047 --> 00:32:06,288
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

455
00:32:06,328 --> 00:32:07,408
[SPEAKER_02]: But what do you think?

456
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:11,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it might be easier if we share the pieces.

457
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:12,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

458
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:25,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there might be more might be more work to try to create 1 document, put it online, then there's issues.

459
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have to that's what I'm thinking.

460
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:27,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

461
00:32:28,393 --> 00:32:28,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

462
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,214
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll keep it the way it is.

463
00:32:31,314 --> 00:32:32,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um.

464
00:32:34,715 --> 00:32:37,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll wait until after this next meeting.

465
00:32:37,676 --> 00:32:38,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess what.

466
00:32:40,747 --> 00:32:45,933
[SPEAKER_02]: When should I just tell the committee, you know, feel free to look over the final report.

467
00:32:46,273 --> 00:32:48,736
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not, it's not on the agenda for Thursday.

468
00:32:48,756 --> 00:32:53,141
[SPEAKER_02]: We can tell them, maybe what we'll do is make it on the agenda.

469
00:32:53,861 --> 00:33:01,169
[SPEAKER_02]: What we have, what's on the agenda is, yeah, what's on the agenda is for us to give a report to the committee so we can just tell the committee.

470
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:03,566
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we have a pretty, we have a draft.

471
00:33:03,766 --> 00:33:18,773
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we do, we have, you know, a completed draft of the final report and, um, that I will be sending them a link so that they can look at it and then give them a timeline to make any changes or comments or edits.

472
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:22,495
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, cause we're in the process of closing this.

473
00:33:23,155 --> 00:33:28,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll, um, and then we'll, we'll sort of vote it through at the September meeting.

474
00:33:28,898 --> 00:33:29,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

475
00:33:30,153 --> 00:33:35,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd wait till after our meeting because people are doing the draft charter now.

476
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:35,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

477
00:33:36,054 --> 00:33:42,955
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just saying I will tell them at the meeting that this is going to be the process.

478
00:33:43,395 --> 00:33:45,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

479
00:33:45,636 --> 00:33:46,976
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they'll have that time.

480
00:33:46,996 --> 00:33:50,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to have to see how it goes on Thursday.

481
00:33:50,397 --> 00:33:52,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can do this.

482
00:33:53,637 --> 00:33:57,538
[SPEAKER_02]: We can finish it at our October meeting without having to have an extra meeting.

483
00:33:57,818 --> 00:33:58,738
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll see.

484
00:34:00,363 --> 00:34:01,204
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the whole committee.

485
00:34:02,504 --> 00:34:08,188
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as we are concerned, we pretty much have our tasks, right?

486
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:11,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we... I mean, we're done with the draft.

487
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:25,138
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just putting together, you know, the appendix materials and I have to add a few footnotes and... You're going to get the survey percent.

488
00:34:25,598 --> 00:34:28,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll talk to Danielle, try to get in touch with David.

489
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:33,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're good.

490
00:34:33,545 --> 00:34:34,086
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

491
00:34:35,747 --> 00:34:37,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

492
00:34:37,988 --> 00:34:38,128
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

493
00:34:38,848 --> 00:34:41,510
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to send it to the Collins Center if they have.

494
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't anticipate that they're going to say much about it.

495
00:34:45,132 --> 00:34:59,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just share their comments when they say if they have anything that makes us think we need to make big changes.

496
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,414
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think that will happen.

497
00:35:03,495 --> 00:35:03,835
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't.

498
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Did we take any pictures or?

499
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:08,120
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

500
00:35:08,561 --> 00:35:11,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we must have had pictures at Wright's Pond.

501
00:35:14,848 --> 00:35:15,509
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a picture.

502
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:26,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's one picture I can think of from Wright's Pond because it was taken by Matt when he was running it.

503
00:35:26,909 --> 00:35:27,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that one.

504
00:35:28,509 --> 00:35:31,330
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like maybe Ron took pictures.

505
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really bad at taking pictures.

506
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Danielle.

507
00:35:36,151 --> 00:35:38,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron or Danielle might have taken pictures at Wright's Pond.

508
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:41,572
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't take any that day at the farmer's market, right?

509
00:35:41,592 --> 00:35:41,772
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

510
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,741
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know any of the hearings.

511
00:35:45,761 --> 00:35:48,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we could do screen grabs from the.

512
00:35:49,724 --> 00:35:50,184
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.

513
00:35:50,244 --> 00:35:52,186
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be kind of nice to include pictures.

514
00:35:54,628 --> 00:35:57,209
[SPEAKER_02]: We needed a committee photographer.

515
00:35:57,229 --> 00:36:01,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just like a picture of all of the committee members.

516
00:36:02,113 --> 00:36:03,074
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be good.

517
00:36:03,234 --> 00:36:07,117
[SPEAKER_02]: But since we've never actually been in a room together, right, all of us.

518
00:36:07,737 --> 00:36:08,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we did actually.

519
00:36:08,878 --> 00:36:10,179
[SPEAKER_02]: We were at City Hall.

520
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:11,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can.

521
00:36:13,457 --> 00:36:16,539
[SPEAKER_01]: meet when we are near the end or something.

522
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

523
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:26,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's not a meeting and we don't talk at all about charter, we just going, getting together for a photo, I think it's okay.

524
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:27,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

525
00:36:28,527 --> 00:36:30,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not, yeah.

526
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:33,630
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to, we're not going to have any discussions or any picture.

527
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:34,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

528
00:36:34,551 --> 00:36:36,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

529
00:36:36,532 --> 00:36:37,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, there's all, it's,

530
00:36:40,433 --> 00:36:41,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.

531
00:36:41,474 --> 00:36:45,276
[SPEAKER_02]: We could get together for a social event, but I don't even know how coached that would be.

532
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:46,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'd have to ask someone.

533
00:36:48,158 --> 00:36:56,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we could just post it publicly and say, public for a photo.

534
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,706
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as we post it, we're fine.

535
00:37:00,706 --> 00:37:01,667
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

536
00:37:02,107 --> 00:37:04,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how easy it would be to get everybody together.

537
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:09,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Last meeting in October could be in person.

538
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:12,259
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a good idea.

539
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:13,359
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be what to do.

540
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:14,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

541
00:37:15,161 --> 00:37:16,842
[SPEAKER_02]: But we might not have everybody.

542
00:37:16,862 --> 00:37:18,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

543
00:37:20,144 --> 00:37:21,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Photoshop, right?

544
00:37:23,947 --> 00:37:24,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Photoshop people.

545
00:37:26,389 --> 00:37:26,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

546
00:37:27,129 --> 00:37:27,449
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

547
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:28,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's think about it.

548
00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:29,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

549
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:30,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a thought.

550
00:37:30,652 --> 00:37:31,392
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a big deal.

551
00:37:31,512 --> 00:37:32,953
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I like the idea.

552
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:34,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the idea.

553
00:37:36,676 --> 00:37:36,936
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

554
00:37:36,976 --> 00:37:37,877
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something to think about.

555
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,703
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, we could put out a message to the committee and say, does anybody have any photos?

556
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:46,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

557
00:37:46,784 --> 00:37:47,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

558
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:50,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can send out the full report.

559
00:37:50,707 --> 00:37:53,448
[SPEAKER_01]: You could say we'd love to include photos if you have any.

560
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:58,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Gee, that one didn't, when we went down to

561
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Not walking court, where was it?

562
00:38:01,881 --> 00:38:02,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

563
00:38:02,522 --> 00:38:03,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I take pictures?

564
00:38:04,203 --> 00:38:09,666
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought one of the people in charge of that place took a picture or something.

565
00:38:11,107 --> 00:38:12,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe they did.

566
00:38:13,048 --> 00:38:14,269
[SPEAKER_01]: From the housing authority?

567
00:38:14,669 --> 00:38:15,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, right.

568
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:16,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, exactly.

569
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,951
[SPEAKER_01]: From one of the listening sessions?

570
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:18,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

571
00:38:21,113 --> 00:38:22,834
[SPEAKER_01]: They say it would be anonymous.

572
00:38:23,194 --> 00:38:23,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

573
00:38:23,374 --> 00:38:26,796
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, would we- I don't know that I could use those.

574
00:38:26,876 --> 00:38:27,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

575
00:38:29,111 --> 00:38:35,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think what would be great is if we had, if we had a photo of the whole committee, that would be good.

576
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:39,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

577
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:49,828
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we can, you know, I mean, it would have been great if we had thought about doing a group photo at that first information section when we were all there.

578
00:38:50,421 --> 00:38:52,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Wright's Pond or the- That was not- No.

579
00:38:53,023 --> 00:38:59,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't there tables or any way they can take a clip off of that with everybody at the table or something?

580
00:38:59,608 --> 00:39:01,429
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do that.

581
00:39:01,449 --> 00:39:08,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, that would have been John and I feel like there was somebody else who had to leave.

582
00:39:09,035 --> 00:39:10,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Laurel, right?

583
00:39:11,297 --> 00:39:11,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

584
00:39:11,497 --> 00:39:13,758
[SPEAKER_02]: It would not have Phyllis and David.

585
00:39:13,778 --> 00:39:15,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.

586
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:17,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

587
00:39:19,062 --> 00:39:19,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Photoshop.

588
00:39:21,801 --> 00:39:23,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody with Photoshop skills.

589
00:39:25,723 --> 00:39:26,483
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not me.

590
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:27,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe my son.

591
00:39:27,243 --> 00:39:28,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, me neither.

592
00:39:29,804 --> 00:39:30,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's something to think about.

593
00:39:30,885 --> 00:39:33,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can at some point, you know, take a committee photo.

594
00:39:34,926 --> 00:39:41,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll bring it up at the meeting and see if, or I'll see what people think about having an in-person meeting in October.

595
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:42,849
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

596
00:39:43,649 --> 00:39:43,930
Okay.

597
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I'll just ask on email.

598
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:49,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I want to take up meeting time with that.

599
00:39:51,163 --> 00:39:54,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe it'll be such an efficient meeting that we'll have plenty of time.

600
00:39:54,484 --> 00:39:55,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, though.
