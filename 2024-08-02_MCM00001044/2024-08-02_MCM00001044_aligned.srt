1
00:00:00,553 --> 00:00:08,977
All right, welcome to the Medford Charter Study Final Report Subcommittee Meeting, July 29th, 2024.

2
00:00:11,118 --> 00:00:12,899
Did everyone have a chance to review the minutes?

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,020
Yes.

4
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:17,562
I'll make a motion to accept those.

5
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:18,982
Second.

6
00:00:19,262 --> 00:00:19,863
All in favor?

7
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:22,944
Aye.

8
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:24,825
Okay.

9
00:00:25,486 --> 00:00:29,348
So, basically, we're just, I mean, thank you, Gene,

10
00:00:31,712 --> 00:00:36,715
those recommendation sections and also for your comments.

11
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:43,018
I went through some of the drafts that I had written and made changes, so that was really helpful.

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,140
Sure.

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,881
I think we're in good shape on that.

14
00:00:48,222 --> 00:00:52,244
Do you have any questions or comments about what you did, Gene or Maury?

15
00:00:52,284 --> 00:00:57,187
Well, I did have a question, but Maury, did you have any thoughts or questions?

16
00:00:57,207 --> 00:00:57,347
No, no.

17
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:57,647
Good.

18
00:00:57,687 --> 00:00:58,208
Nice job.

19
00:00:59,147 --> 00:00:59,507
Thanks.

20
00:01:00,388 --> 00:01:03,349
I'd like to provide demographics from the survey.

21
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:03,449
Okay.

22
00:01:05,951 --> 00:01:18,838
In the community engagement section, because I feel like that would help respond to people's, the criticisms I've heard that it's not reflective of, and if it's not reflective, that's fine.

23
00:01:18,898 --> 00:01:22,420
I think that we're in a better position if we say it up front, you know.

24
00:01:23,642 --> 00:01:26,525
So was David doing an analysis?

25
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:29,927
Yeah, I need to figure out how to get in touch with David.

26
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:36,713
I, you know, he said he was going to be around all summer, but he hasn't been responsive.

27
00:01:36,773 --> 00:01:39,415
So we'll have to try to get in touch with him.

28
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:43,239
But we have like the, I mean,

29
00:01:45,213 --> 00:01:46,915
I can find them.

30
00:01:47,355 --> 00:01:47,635
Yeah.

31
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:48,756
So you have the data.

32
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:49,937
It's just a question.

33
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,818
He was going to make a survey report.

34
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:53,320
That's what we asked him to do.

35
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,781
Okay.

36
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:57,123
I mean, I could do the analysis myself.

37
00:01:57,203 --> 00:01:58,684
It would take time.

38
00:01:59,164 --> 00:01:59,465
Okay.

39
00:01:59,545 --> 00:02:03,368
And if he's already doing it, I thought, well, then I don't need to.

40
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:04,008
Yeah, yeah.

41
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:07,711
No, that's good.

42
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:13,456
So we should connect with Javid and see exactly what he's going to do.

43
00:02:16,446 --> 00:02:27,510
If David is unable to do the survey, he already created something for us that did not include the demographics that he shared at a meeting.

44
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:31,051
At a full meeting?

45
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:34,032
Yeah, at the full meeting.

46
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:34,973
That was a while back.

47
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:37,034
I may have missed that.

48
00:02:37,294 --> 00:02:38,134
We'll look into that.

49
00:02:38,154 --> 00:02:39,935
Because we have

50
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:47,573
the demographic pie charts, right, that the survey created?

51
00:02:47,593 --> 00:02:49,173
Oh, we do?

52
00:02:49,373 --> 00:02:49,893
Okay.

53
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:56,436
I mean, I downloaded because I remember seeing the I thought the V was gonna put that all together.

54
00:02:57,556 --> 00:02:59,097
He's Yeah, we have to check with them.

55
00:02:59,717 --> 00:02:59,937
Yeah.

56
00:03:00,017 --> 00:03:03,719
But there but Google, you know, Google surveys,

57
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,306
did create pie charts.

58
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:08,707
Is it in the survey folder?

59
00:03:08,727 --> 00:03:09,768
That's a good question.

60
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:13,030
No, it might just be in the survey results.

61
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,311
And it didn't get pulled.

62
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:15,111
I can't.

63
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:16,312
Oh, jeez.

64
00:03:17,112 --> 00:03:17,973
Is that really?

65
00:03:17,993 --> 00:03:19,754
This must be new.

66
00:03:20,414 --> 00:03:20,794
Sorry.

67
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:23,636
I tried to minimize so I could look in the.

68
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:26,898
They said I can't minimize Zoom while I'm recording.

69
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:28,599
That's never happened to me before.

70
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:30,720
It'd be a new thing.

71
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:39,809
OK, so I'll look and see, because the other person, Danielle, created the survey.

72
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:45,134
So there's a certain way you can look at the survey results.

73
00:03:45,154 --> 00:03:48,096
And whenever I would look at the results, I would see the pie charts.

74
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:50,138
I assume it didn't go away.

75
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,292
I was able to download an Excel spreadsheet with all the results.

76
00:03:59,392 --> 00:04:00,912
Yeah.

77
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:07,594
But I'm not the owner of the survey, so I don't know that I can see that.

78
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:12,175
The person who could see it is Danielle.

79
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:12,975
Okay.

80
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:18,816
But I should be able to see it because I think she gave me access to it, so I'm just trying to look for it right now.

81
00:04:18,896 --> 00:04:21,297
If you have that, that's fine because then I can just say,

82
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:31,453
you know, 10% were, you know, 40% were renters or you know, whatever, because I think yeah, exactly.

83
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:42,302
Compare that to like Medford demographics if we have that and just to yeah, so we'll talk about how representative it is.

84
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:49,069
So yeah, I see what's in the folder is just the Excel spreadsheet.

85
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:49,409
Yeah.

86
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:55,493
Yeah, so I know they exist because I saw them.

87
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:57,674
So let me ask Danielle about that.

88
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:11,938
There might be a special way that I can maybe dig up the link she gave me a long time ago to look at the survey results, but I'll ask her.

89
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:16,199
OK.

90
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:19,220
And the other important thing,

91
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:32,015
to remember about that demographics info is that it include the percentage of people, I think it's in the pie chart, who said they didn't want to answer.

92
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:34,537
Right.

93
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:35,437
Yeah.

94
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:40,481
Because some people, because remember, we had prefer not to answer as an option.

95
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:40,721
Right.

96
00:05:41,902 --> 00:05:43,724
But I think that's in the pie chart.

97
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,787
OK.

98
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:59,212
Okay, so Jen, did you have any other questions about or thoughts about what you put together?

99
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:15,903
No, with the Article 8, you know, citizen participation, I just did it broadly and I didn't, you know, go through each one or what it does.

100
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:19,446
I think that's how we talked about presenting it.

101
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,667
Yes, definitely.

102
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:22,722
Okay.

103
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:23,423
Yeah.

104
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:32,396
I mean, and that one in particular was sort of challenging because it had all those different parts.

105
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:35,060
Right.

106
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,382
So I just, you know.

107
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:53,116
said they include X, Y, Z, and then talked about the requirement that at the ballot, you need to show that you have at least 20 or 25% of the registered voters participating for it to be valid.

108
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:57,518
So- I think, yeah, I think that's okay for that one.

109
00:06:57,538 --> 00:06:57,618
Okay.

110
00:06:58,298 --> 00:06:59,679
Because it is pretty,

111
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:21,194
thick when you get into the- I mean, you could break it down and say, do different recommendations for each one, but I think it makes sense to group them together.

112
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:22,334
I think it's fine.

113
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,055
Okay.

114
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:34,580
I mean, if we broke them up, it would be like the referendum, the free petition,

115
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:41,416
citizen initiative measures, citizen referendum measures, and then recall.

116
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:43,096
There would be like four, right?

117
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:49,278
Or you might want to lump citizen initiative and referendum together.

118
00:07:49,298 --> 00:07:49,378
Yeah.

119
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:56,219
Because I think they have the same numbers, but then the referendum has different numbers.

120
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:59,800
Yeah.

121
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,481
Maybe it's worth doing that since recall is

122
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:09,719
going to be seen maybe as different than those things, but I don't know.

123
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,399
What do you think, Maury?

124
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,960
I think recall should be by itself.

125
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,220
Okay.

126
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:24,143
We can keep the other three grouped the way it is, it's fine, but I think I'd pull recall out of there and just make it a separate line item and

127
00:08:27,097 --> 00:08:29,058
You don't want to be linking it with everything else.

128
00:08:29,438 --> 00:08:33,020
It's kind of like a horse of a different color, you know what I'm saying, by itself.

129
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,360
Yeah.

130
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,041
No, I think that's a good point.

131
00:08:37,102 --> 00:08:37,422
OK.

132
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:39,703
Do you mind doing that?

133
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,204
No, I can rewrite that.

134
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:42,864
And we'll just have two.

135
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:46,266
We'll have like citizen initiative and then recall.

136
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:46,866
OK.

137
00:08:47,387 --> 00:08:47,907
That's good.

138
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:48,447
Great.

139
00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:49,067
Thank you.

140
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:51,008
OK.

141
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,470
So I think we're in pretty good shape.

142
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:55,931
What else?

143
00:08:57,055 --> 00:09:19,513
I've done a little bit, but I need to do more on putting all that public comment that we've collected with the survey and through emails into the issue sheets, that Google sheet, because we figured that that would be the easiest way to include it in the final report.

144
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,334
Say that again, Milva?

145
00:09:22,454 --> 00:09:23,235
I'm sorry.

146
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:26,017
We have a bunch of public comment.

147
00:09:26,177 --> 00:09:30,380
Like the survey also gave people the opportunity to write, right?

148
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:43,350
So, um, and you know, I mean, they're all kind of hard to access because they're in that Excel spreadsheet.

149
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:49,235
I was going to put them into the Google issue sheet under this under, you know, which,

150
00:09:50,047 --> 00:10:01,589
would represent a good amount of work, but it seemed like sort of the best way to give, to put that public comment into the final report was to have it consolidated into that issue sheets.

151
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,070
Right, and have a link instead of attaching the issue sheet.

152
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:07,511
Yeah.

153
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:10,071
So here's a link to all the comment, like email.

154
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:11,671
Okay.

155
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:19,113
But maybe, do you think maybe if the public comments from the survey can be exported,

156
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:31,833
Maybe we can just, I've never exported from, I don't know what the, it seems like there probably is a way to export them, right?

157
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:38,755
I feel like that's waiting comments received from the survey over all the other comments.

158
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:39,716
Yeah, that's true.

159
00:10:39,816 --> 00:10:44,178
Though I don't like highlighting those and not highlighting

160
00:10:45,078 --> 00:11:02,468
Right, public comment we got via email or other means like if I yeah, no, I was just thinking maybe you do you set up a link with with all different categories, whatever it is, and they can access if they want to see public comments, or if they want to see public emails, or they want.

161
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:05,110
It's all there on one link and what's.

162
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:09,248
Yeah, and that was the idea of the issue sheets.

163
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:13,231
I was just thinking of a way to lighten the workload, because transferring all those.

164
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:14,592
But I can do it.

165
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:15,233
I'll do it.

166
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:16,694
Do you want help?

167
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:18,355
I mean, I can help you.

168
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:19,536
We'll see.

169
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,338
I'll start it and see how it goes.

170
00:11:21,858 --> 00:11:22,779
OK, thanks.

171
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,681
I'm on vacation for like 10 days, mid-August.

172
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:26,022
OK.

173
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:31,134
Thank you.

174
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:42,443
And, you know, there were a few comments that were sort of frivolous, and I don't know how we feel about, like, if we just make a judgment call, then I'll put those in the issue sheets.

175
00:11:44,044 --> 00:11:45,125
I think that's fine.

176
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:50,849
There's, like, another category, but if they're not at all relevant, I don't think they should be included.

177
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:51,050
Right.

178
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:51,390
Yeah.

179
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:51,630
Okay.

180
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,521
I want to know what you're doing about fixing Mystic Avenue or something like that.

181
00:11:58,561 --> 00:11:59,522
It's not relevant.

182
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:00,242
Yeah.

183
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:00,622
Right.

184
00:12:01,162 --> 00:12:01,402
Right.

185
00:12:01,682 --> 00:12:02,082
OK.

186
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,343
That sounds good.

187
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:20,027
So basically, the main things we have to do now are put together the append, just sort of do this little bit of revision on sections, put together the appendix, which I started a folder and put the materials in it.

188
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:21,648
We'll have to figure out how to structure it.

189
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:27,009
Oh, I keep forgetting that I can't minimize anymore.

190
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:32,833
Did you all see the appendix holder?

191
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,995
Let's see, what's in there now?

192
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:40,878
And there's probably more that needs to go in there.

193
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:52,146
So, we could just, I don't know, have you ever made an appendix, Gene?

194
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:54,382
Do you know what style?

195
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:56,743
We don't really have to follow any particular style.

196
00:12:59,024 --> 00:13:11,869
I use Word and use their headings and a table of contents.

197
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:20,793
We're going to have a table of contents for the whole report, but also a table of contents for the appendix because the appendix is going to be a lot of stuff in there.

198
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:30,388
Yeah, you can put that in your main table of contents and then add links, click on it, and it'll take you to the sections if you use.

199
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:40,090
So if you end up format, like doing formatting the whole thing and putting the table of contents in, will you do the appendix too?

200
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:45,232
That means you would decide how to organize the appendix, which is fine.

201
00:13:47,624 --> 00:14:06,094
There aren't a lot of references to the appendix, but I did make a couple in the introductory letter, right, where I said I referenced a Collins Center memo and the generic modern charter, and then I just put appendix number or whatever.

202
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:06,835
I don't know how.

203
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:10,137
It's sort of like a footnote, but not exactly.

204
00:14:10,157 --> 00:14:15,700
We can do the appendix in the order they're referenced in the document.

205
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:17,357
Okay.

206
00:14:18,318 --> 00:14:21,219
I don't know, or by section.

207
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:22,119
Okay.

208
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,921
So right now we'll just keep collecting.

209
00:14:25,521 --> 00:14:34,485
And then the footnotes is the other thing.

210
00:14:37,706 --> 00:14:42,869
The footnotes are going to be before, maybe at the very end after the appendix.

211
00:14:46,805 --> 00:14:51,687
I had put them in the, let's see, I put mine in the, I think I had one footnote.

212
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:53,868
Oh, you put them within the recommendations.

213
00:14:54,188 --> 00:14:54,728
Yeah.

214
00:14:55,188 --> 00:14:57,689
Oh, that's probably makes more, that, that makes more sense.

215
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:58,510
Okay.

216
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,491
Then I will footnote my recommendations too.

217
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:02,932
Okay.

218
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,014
And then we don't have to have footnotes at the end.

219
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:11,215
That's good.

220
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:12,195
I like that.

221
00:15:12,255 --> 00:15:12,636
Thank you.

222
00:15:15,737 --> 00:15:15,957
Okay.

223
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:29,241
Is there anything else that we were, that I mean, that we're supposed to, the call-in center offered to read the final report too.

224
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:34,686
So should we, should I just throw it together now in draft form and send it to them?

225
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:36,948
Maybe in case.

226
00:15:37,348 --> 00:15:37,849
Okay.

227
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,873
Because I mean, you can just send them the link to the folder or something.

228
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:43,294
Yeah.

229
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:53,424
I can go through and clean up, because I see people made edits, so that it's cleaner.

230
00:15:53,444 --> 00:16:03,807
Do you want to go through any of the edits?

231
00:16:05,927 --> 00:16:07,888
I didn't think there were any.

232
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,590
I think you gave, like I had questions for you, like what languages?

233
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,641
Yeah.

234
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,082
I told you that, right?

235
00:16:18,582 --> 00:16:19,003
Yeah.

236
00:16:19,023 --> 00:16:24,007
So I don't see any ones that we need to discuss.

237
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:25,068
OK.

238
00:16:28,451 --> 00:16:30,292
That's good that you put that in there.

239
00:16:30,672 --> 00:16:35,316
I asked Frances, but I haven't heard back yet about the translations.

240
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,479
But I know I have a bunch of the handouts.

241
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,582
There must be electronic versions of them.

242
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:49,582
Frances would have those because I only ever, we only ever got the hard copies.

243
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:50,723
I have the hard copies.

244
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:52,644
I suppose I could scan one.

245
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,027
To put in the appendix or?

246
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:56,707
Yeah.

247
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:58,308
Do we want to put them in the appendix?

248
00:16:58,388 --> 00:16:59,009
What do you think?

249
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:05,754
Like, because we, we talk, did we talk about, do we need to put our flyer in the appendix?

250
00:17:07,055 --> 00:17:07,575
You know?

251
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:11,538
I don't, I don't, I'm, I don't know.

252
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:14,100
I feel like you don't want to just put a ton of stuff in there.

253
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,600
Right.

254
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:15,381
Exactly.

255
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:21,720
I know, so maybe we just say that we did translation so we don't include all that stuff.

256
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,744
The flyers and the glossary, we had a glossary that was translated also.

257
00:17:29,786 --> 00:17:31,327
Right, okay, so.

258
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:38,584
A glossary with key terms?

259
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:40,424
Yeah.

260
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:47,145
Like I said, I have them in the ad that I used to bring to all our events.

261
00:17:48,506 --> 00:17:49,406
They're downstairs.

262
00:17:49,906 --> 00:17:50,266
Okay.

263
00:17:50,886 --> 00:18:04,609
But yeah, we have flyers in different languages and then we have the glossary, which was just basic because remember we talked about how people wouldn't necessarily know even what a charter is or what word representation is and things like that.

264
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:11,615
So it was just, yeah.

265
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:22,405
Okay.

266
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:28,791
I see in the Article 6, you had a question.

267
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,223
Yeah, you did have a couple comments maybe we should talk about the you don't.

268
00:18:35,343 --> 00:18:36,264
Oh yeah, that's right.

269
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:39,046
Yeah, the annual meeting.

270
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:42,828
I thought it was an ordinance or that they were creating an ordinance.

271
00:18:42,848 --> 00:18:49,793
They did create an ordinance and the ordinance has been passed, but I don't know that that annual meeting is part of it.

272
00:18:54,570 --> 00:19:09,354
But isn't okay, so I could I mean there's a bunch of there's Yeah, there's a whole timeline in the budget ordinance for Different things but a meeting an annual meeting with all the branches of government.

273
00:19:09,434 --> 00:19:21,697
I I'm not sure that's it Okay And then you want wanted to know whether we should list the reasons we declined to adopt the

274
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:23,973
Yeah.

275
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:25,334
Budget lines.

276
00:19:27,195 --> 00:19:27,795
What do you think?

277
00:19:34,598 --> 00:19:39,380
Yeah, I think we could say that as it's prohibited by state law.

278
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,022
If we do that, should we cite it?

279
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:45,902
Sure.

280
00:19:45,922 --> 00:19:51,765
I used to know all these numbers off the top of my head, but I'll find it.

281
00:19:52,535 --> 00:19:54,816
Okay, might do it as a footnote.

282
00:19:55,576 --> 00:19:56,817
Yeah, that works.

283
00:19:57,257 --> 00:19:59,418
Yes, I would footnote it.

284
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:00,958
That's the right way to go.

285
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,159
Okay.

286
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,160
I'll find it.

287
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,061
You'll find it.

288
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,161
Yeah.

289
00:20:09,682 --> 00:20:11,103
I think I can find it pretty easily.

290
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:12,943
Okay.

291
00:20:14,984 --> 00:20:16,225
Okay, so that's good.

292
00:20:18,646 --> 00:20:19,066
And then

293
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:26,655
Everything else is pretty, like I, did I have any questions?

294
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,922
Introductory now, article two, yeah.

295
00:20:35,563 --> 00:20:37,604
How do we end up, Bilba, on the?

296
00:20:38,827 --> 00:20:39,187
Ethics.

297
00:20:39,428 --> 00:20:42,810
What do we end up on that?

298
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:43,791
We're voting.

299
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:46,993
We're going to talk about it and vote on it on Thursday.

300
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:47,854
Thursday.

301
00:20:47,874 --> 00:20:48,334
Yeah, right.

302
00:20:48,354 --> 00:20:48,574
Yeah.

303
00:20:48,654 --> 00:20:49,455
All right.

304
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,998
I thought that's what we did, but I wasn't sure because it's been so much.

305
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:53,658
Yeah.

306
00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:54,079
Yeah.

307
00:20:57,104 --> 00:21:23,850
Yeah, yeah, I was just reading over this the wardrobe is the article to when I was trying to I was thinking it would be good to put stats in about because I said It's the smallest in the state for a city of our size and if I could find exactly, you know, how many I think there's only two others And and you know the numbers on at-large versus Ward and then

308
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:36,655
hybrid, I don't know, I was thinking maybe of trying to find the stats on those, but I'm not sure how easy it will be to find them.

309
00:21:38,456 --> 00:21:49,481
Cause you know, municipalities are sort of independent and I don't, the only organization I feel like that would keep those stats is the Massachusetts Municipal Association.

310
00:21:49,862 --> 00:21:52,703
And so I could look there, I'll look there.

311
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:57,769
Let's see.

312
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,832
Don't we have a table with all 351 cities?

313
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:00,892
No.

314
00:22:00,912 --> 00:22:02,794
We had a table with just about 50-60 cities.

315
00:22:02,814 --> 00:22:03,134
Okay.

316
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:03,875
Which is, yeah.

317
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:27,843
I mean, it's weird because there's some places, because the city town thing, like Framingham just became a city, right?

318
00:22:28,283 --> 00:22:35,946
So there's some towns that are probably really cities, but they haven't decided to call themselves cities yet.

319
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:48,771
But mostly we were trying to compare municipalities that were more like us as opposed to, because towns will have

320
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:50,222
town meeting.

321
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:56,207
Did you prepare that or did Collins Center prepare it?

322
00:22:56,607 --> 00:22:59,590
No, I actually found that.

323
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:02,593
It was prepared by problem.

324
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:04,374
I don't know exactly who prepared it.

325
00:23:06,476 --> 00:23:15,124
I got it off the Somerville Charter Study website, their materials, and then I double-checked each one.

326
00:23:16,723 --> 00:23:35,431
But it's really hard actually because sometimes the websites aren't up to date and when you look online for a charter to check and make sure that the composition is what that chart said, sometimes the charters online aren't the most, so I did it to the best of my ability.

327
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:42,695
But Somerville's committee had two part-time employees, so I'm guessing they put it together.

328
00:23:43,935 --> 00:23:45,776
I think that's probably who put it together.

329
00:23:47,351 --> 00:23:52,693
I don't know if anyone wants to get in the weeds on it, but it'd be nice to provide to someone if they wanted to.

330
00:23:52,713 --> 00:23:54,574
I know.

331
00:23:54,594 --> 00:24:02,076
At other cities and towns just to see where Medford stands and look at the data themselves.

332
00:24:02,597 --> 00:24:03,417
It is useful.

333
00:24:04,397 --> 00:24:09,279
Like I said, it's hard sometimes to keep it updated.

334
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,440
When I was looking up,

335
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:13,808
Because I wanted to double check everything.

336
00:24:13,888 --> 00:24:20,812
And there were some cities that said, or one or two, I think it was Brockton, that said four-year term for mayor.

337
00:24:20,852 --> 00:24:22,954
When I looked in their charter, it said two-year.

338
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:30,138
And their charter hadn't been updated on the website or something.

339
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:33,209
Because it was very recent that they switched to four year.

340
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:38,833
And then I'm actually unclear on whether some places could switch to four year with that.

341
00:24:38,893 --> 00:24:43,355
I mean, there's so many processes that are involved.

342
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:48,418
I think our laws have not been updated in the last couple of years because we don't have a city solicitor.

343
00:24:50,244 --> 00:24:51,345
Yeah.

344
00:24:51,585 --> 00:24:58,331
So like the things that have been passed have not been put on our website because they want to review them before.

345
00:24:58,391 --> 00:25:00,312
So maybe that's in other cities that.

346
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:01,754
Yeah.

347
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:02,654
Yeah.

348
00:25:02,674 --> 00:25:02,714
So.

349
00:25:04,756 --> 00:25:07,859
So so I think it's pretty accurate, but, you know.

350
00:25:10,461 --> 00:25:16,065
We maybe could include it with the caveat that that it was created in 20, you know.

351
00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:19,368
I don't know, when did I do it?

352
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,084
Probably, yeah, we could put a date on it.

353
00:25:24,164 --> 00:25:24,505
I don't know.

354
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:25,646
We could include it.

355
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:27,748
I mean, I think it's mostly accurate.

356
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:30,091
There might be a couple of things that are changed.

357
00:25:31,732 --> 00:25:38,439
But it still gives the sense of, it shows you kind of visually, oh, wow, look.

358
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:45,578
We're only one of a few that don't have ward representation.

359
00:25:45,598 --> 00:25:47,678
It shows you the size of the councils.

360
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:49,819
It shows you the size of the school committees.

361
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,480
I think it was really helpful.

362
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,241
Yeah.

363
00:25:54,781 --> 00:26:03,063
And even the ward representation, there's only a few cities that don't have it, and Cambridge is one of them, which this isn't in the chart, of course.

364
00:26:03,204 --> 00:26:07,365
But Cambridge has ranked choice voting, which, you know,

365
00:26:09,594 --> 00:26:18,699
So even though they have at large, they also have a process that kind of mitigates the potential issues.

366
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:30,526
Because interestingly, in the Lowell lawsuit, in the settlement, one of the options for Lowell was to go to rank choice voting.

367
00:26:31,226 --> 00:26:34,688
They said either ward representation or rank choice voting.

368
00:26:35,946 --> 00:26:39,189
And they did the word representation.

369
00:26:42,872 --> 00:26:43,993
I thought that was interesting.

370
00:26:44,513 --> 00:26:47,735
Yeah.

371
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:50,538
Okay, so maybe we'll put that in the appendix.

372
00:26:50,758 --> 00:26:51,499
I'll put it in there.

373
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:55,141
I'll put it in the appendix folder.

374
00:26:55,161 --> 00:27:01,086
Or like a link to it, because people might want to... Yeah, I don't know.

375
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:01,647
That's fine.

376
00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:04,438
Well, it's not that big.

377
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:05,859
It's not like a huge document.

378
00:27:05,879 --> 00:27:07,000
It's an Excel file.

379
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:19,047
If you're putting together the appendix, then can you just choose to put some of the things in as links and some of them as whatever?

380
00:27:19,247 --> 00:27:19,328
Yeah.

381
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:19,928
Right?

382
00:27:20,668 --> 00:27:21,509
We'll have to, like,

383
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:26,378
Change access to the ones we want to share.

384
00:27:26,598 --> 00:27:27,139
Exactly.

385
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:27,560
Yeah.

386
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,621
Or maybe.

387
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:32,145
And if I need, does the owner have to do that?

388
00:27:32,705 --> 00:27:33,086
Yeah.

389
00:27:33,707 --> 00:27:35,769
So if I need to do that, you can just let me know.

390
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:36,670
Okay.

391
00:27:38,432 --> 00:27:39,854
But I'll put it in the folder for now.

392
00:27:41,335 --> 00:27:41,796
And you know,

393
00:27:43,174 --> 00:27:51,136
If the time comes when we're making the appendix and we decide, you know what, we don't really need this in the appendix, we can just not include it.

394
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:55,538
But right now, we'll just lean on putting things in the folder that we think we might include.

395
00:27:57,118 --> 00:27:59,539
Because we have a lot of materials.

396
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:04,020
We do.

397
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,181
I think we're pretty good.

398
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:10,582
Is there anything else we need to do?

399
00:28:12,138 --> 00:28:12,718
Well, so.

400
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:16,801
We have to decide when we're going to give it to the committee.

401
00:28:17,942 --> 00:28:25,006
Is it now my turn to put in, am I putting it in a full document or is Daveed doing that or?

402
00:28:26,187 --> 00:28:26,968
Putting what?

403
00:28:28,088 --> 00:28:29,989
Merging it all into one report.

404
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,430
Am I doing that now?

405
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,431
That's a good question.

406
00:28:32,471 --> 00:28:37,915
Or are we letting people, like do you want the call-in center, let people edit it first?

407
00:28:39,126 --> 00:28:51,933
I would like, I'm going to give the Collins Center a draft version, and I was going to just throw it in a document for them, but that won't be the final document, whatever you, because you're going to figure out how to put it in, so you can format it right and stuff.

408
00:28:52,494 --> 00:28:57,957
But if you want to do that, because we, because the other thing we have to do is share it with the committee, with the wider committee.

409
00:28:57,977 --> 00:28:59,818
Right.

410
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:07,622
So we can either, we can do that now, we can share the folder with them, and they can just look at it in pieces, or we can put it all together.

411
00:29:08,063 --> 00:29:08,523
What do you think?

412
00:29:09,732 --> 00:29:13,573
I mean, I have time now, so I could try to put it in a file.

413
00:29:13,673 --> 00:29:13,893
OK.

414
00:29:15,294 --> 00:29:16,714
That would be great.

415
00:29:19,295 --> 00:29:20,275
See how far I can get.

416
00:29:21,196 --> 00:29:22,156
OK.

417
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:27,678
The only thing I would like, let's see.

418
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:35,100
I'm just thinking about just the stuff that has to be little changes.

419
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,390
Oh, yeah.

420
00:29:42,831 --> 00:29:47,012
Yeah, like the stuff that's in highlighted, would you just keep the highlights or?

421
00:29:47,032 --> 00:29:47,112
Yeah.

422
00:29:47,992 --> 00:29:48,312
Yeah.

423
00:29:49,152 --> 00:29:50,993
And then we.

424
00:29:51,093 --> 00:29:54,254
And then we don't work in this anymore and we work in that document.

425
00:29:57,235 --> 00:30:03,316
Yeah, so the one thing about Google Docs and Word, they don't play nice always.

426
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:05,577
Just FYI.

427
00:30:09,122 --> 00:30:14,623
As a consultant, most of my stuff I'm doing with Teams because that's a Microsoft product.

428
00:30:15,904 --> 00:30:16,844
It acts a little better.

429
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:20,225
Just know that.

430
00:30:20,905 --> 00:30:21,865
It's just a warning.

431
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:27,586
I think we can still do it this way.

432
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:30,647
You mean some of the comments might not transfer?

433
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:33,848
Sometimes the formatting, it gets all,

434
00:30:35,037 --> 00:30:37,659
Messed up, we can see.

435
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,801
Or the footnotes, you can't see the footnotes.

436
00:30:40,821 --> 00:30:42,483
They disappear, but they're there.

437
00:30:42,503 --> 00:30:59,275
It just doesn't always, perhaps purposefully, they don't always... I could make it a PDF and then put it up, but then it's hard to edit.

438
00:31:00,455 --> 00:31:00,855
Anyways.

439
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:10,318
Well, I'm just wondering, I mean, in one sense, it makes sense for you to do it now in case you have to sort of make changes and whatnot.

440
00:31:10,978 --> 00:31:18,860
But on the other hand, if we need to keep working on it, should we wait until we're done with the edits?

441
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,081
I don't know.

442
00:31:20,261 --> 00:31:20,781
What do you think?

443
00:31:24,442 --> 00:31:24,622
Hm.

444
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:27,763
I mean.

445
00:31:29,247 --> 00:31:34,031
We would like to give the full committee one document to look at and not sections.

446
00:31:34,511 --> 00:31:34,792
Is that?

447
00:31:34,872 --> 00:31:41,697
I think it's okay to give the committee, you know, to tell them to just go into the folder and look at the different sections.

448
00:31:41,957 --> 00:31:42,858
I think that's okay.

449
00:31:43,118 --> 00:31:43,979
What do you think, Maury?

450
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,801
Yeah, I think so too.

451
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:51,365
You know, soon to be like a lot of maybe extra work.

452
00:31:51,385 --> 00:31:57,010
We don't have to do work that's already been done to try to put it together on one whole draft form just for the committee.

453
00:31:57,722 --> 00:32:05,187
Yeah, because if it's going to maybe create potential issues for our final editing and stuff to move it now, then maybe we should wait.

454
00:32:06,047 --> 00:32:06,288
OK.

455
00:32:06,328 --> 00:32:07,408
But what do you think?

456
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:11,871
Yeah, I think it might be easier if we share the pieces.

457
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:12,732
Yeah.

458
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:25,572
Because there might be more might be more work to try to create 1 document, put it online, then there's issues.

459
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,372
Then we have to that's what I'm thinking.

460
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:27,753
Yeah.

461
00:32:28,393 --> 00:32:28,813
Okay.

462
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,214
So we'll keep it the way it is.

463
00:32:31,314 --> 00:32:32,354
And, um.

464
00:32:34,715 --> 00:32:37,656
Maybe we'll wait until after this next meeting.

465
00:32:37,676 --> 00:32:38,337
I guess what.

466
00:32:40,747 --> 00:32:45,933
When should I just tell the committee, you know, feel free to look over the final report.

467
00:32:46,273 --> 00:32:48,736
We're not, it's not on the agenda for Thursday.

468
00:32:48,756 --> 00:32:53,141
We can tell them, maybe what we'll do is make it on the agenda.

469
00:32:53,861 --> 00:33:01,169
What we have, what's on the agenda is, yeah, what's on the agenda is for us to give a report to the committee so we can just tell the committee.

470
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:03,566
you know, we have a pretty, we have a draft.

471
00:33:03,766 --> 00:33:18,773
I mean, we do, we have, you know, a completed draft of the final report and, um, that I will be sending them a link so that they can look at it and then give them a timeline to make any changes or comments or edits.

472
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:22,495
And, uh, cause we're in the process of closing this.

473
00:33:23,155 --> 00:33:28,238
And then we'll, um, and then we'll, we'll sort of vote it through at the September meeting.

474
00:33:28,898 --> 00:33:29,058
Yeah.

475
00:33:30,153 --> 00:33:35,674
Yeah, I'd wait till after our meeting because people are doing the draft charter now.

476
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:35,954
Right.

477
00:33:36,054 --> 00:33:42,955
No, I'm just saying I will tell them at the meeting that this is going to be the process.

478
00:33:43,395 --> 00:33:45,196
Yeah.

479
00:33:45,636 --> 00:33:46,976
And then they'll have that time.

480
00:33:46,996 --> 00:33:50,377
And we're going to have to see how it goes on Thursday.

481
00:33:50,397 --> 00:33:52,637
I think we can do this.

482
00:33:53,637 --> 00:33:57,538
We can finish it at our October meeting without having to have an extra meeting.

483
00:33:57,818 --> 00:33:58,738
But we'll see.

484
00:34:00,363 --> 00:34:01,204
I mean, the whole committee.

485
00:34:02,504 --> 00:34:08,188
So as far as we are concerned, we pretty much have our tasks, right?

486
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:11,290
I don't think we... I mean, we're done with the draft.

487
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:25,138
There's just putting together, you know, the appendix materials and I have to add a few footnotes and... You're going to get the survey percent.

488
00:34:25,598 --> 00:34:28,880
Yeah, I'll talk to Danielle, try to get in touch with David.

489
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:33,425
And I think we're good.

490
00:34:33,545 --> 00:34:34,086
What do you think?

491
00:34:35,747 --> 00:34:37,788
Yeah.

492
00:34:37,988 --> 00:34:38,128
OK.

493
00:34:38,848 --> 00:34:41,510
So I'm going to send it to the Collins Center if they have.

494
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,631
I don't anticipate that they're going to say much about it.

495
00:34:45,132 --> 00:34:59,620
I'll just share their comments when they say if they have anything that makes us think we need to make big changes.

496
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,414
But I don't think that will happen.

497
00:35:03,495 --> 00:35:03,835
We didn't.

498
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,497
Did we take any pictures or?

499
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:08,120
I know, right?

500
00:35:08,561 --> 00:35:11,764
I mean, we must have had pictures at Wright's Pond.

501
00:35:14,848 --> 00:35:15,509
There's a picture.

502
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:26,069
I think there's one picture I can think of from Wright's Pond because it was taken by Matt when he was running it.

503
00:35:26,909 --> 00:35:27,849
Yeah, that one.

504
00:35:28,509 --> 00:35:31,330
But I feel like maybe Ron took pictures.

505
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,870
I'm really bad at taking pictures.

506
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,850
Maybe Danielle.

507
00:35:36,151 --> 00:35:38,851
Ron or Danielle might have taken pictures at Wright's Pond.

508
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:41,572
We didn't take any that day at the farmer's market, right?

509
00:35:41,592 --> 00:35:41,772
No.

510
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,741
And I don't know any of the hearings.

511
00:35:45,761 --> 00:35:48,964
I guess we could do screen grabs from the.

512
00:35:49,724 --> 00:35:50,184
You're right.

513
00:35:50,244 --> 00:35:52,186
It would be kind of nice to include pictures.

514
00:35:54,628 --> 00:35:57,209
We needed a committee photographer.

515
00:35:57,229 --> 00:36:01,753
Or just like a picture of all of the committee members.

516
00:36:02,113 --> 00:36:03,074
That would be good.

517
00:36:03,234 --> 00:36:07,117
But since we've never actually been in a room together, right, all of us.

518
00:36:07,737 --> 00:36:08,778
Well, we did actually.

519
00:36:08,878 --> 00:36:10,179
We were at City Hall.

520
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:11,580
Maybe we can.

521
00:36:13,457 --> 00:36:16,539
meet when we are near the end or something.

522
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,640
Yeah.

523
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:26,686
And if it's not a meeting and we don't talk at all about charter, we just going, getting together for a photo, I think it's okay.

524
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:27,826
Okay.

525
00:36:28,527 --> 00:36:30,048
Because it's not, yeah.

526
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:33,630
We're not going to, we're not going to have any discussions or any picture.

527
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:34,531
I don't know.

528
00:36:34,551 --> 00:36:36,512
Okay.

529
00:36:36,532 --> 00:36:37,933
Um, you know, there's all, it's,

530
00:36:40,433 --> 00:36:41,434
Yeah, I don't know.

531
00:36:41,474 --> 00:36:45,276
We could get together for a social event, but I don't even know how coached that would be.

532
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:46,577
I guess I'd have to ask someone.

533
00:36:48,158 --> 00:36:56,564
Or we could just post it publicly and say, public for a photo.

534
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,706
As long as we post it, we're fine.

535
00:37:00,706 --> 00:37:01,667
But I don't know.

536
00:37:02,107 --> 00:37:04,809
I don't know how easy it would be to get everybody together.

537
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:09,192
Last meeting in October could be in person.

538
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:12,259
That sounds like a good idea.

539
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:13,359
That might be what to do.

540
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:14,720
Yeah.

541
00:37:15,161 --> 00:37:16,842
But we might not have everybody.

542
00:37:16,862 --> 00:37:18,723
Right.

543
00:37:20,144 --> 00:37:21,205
Photoshop, right?

544
00:37:23,947 --> 00:37:24,847
Photoshop people.

545
00:37:26,389 --> 00:37:26,689
Yeah.

546
00:37:27,129 --> 00:37:27,449
All right.

547
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:28,530
Let's think about it.

548
00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:29,971
Yeah.

549
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:30,632
Just a thought.

550
00:37:30,652 --> 00:37:31,392
It's not a big deal.

551
00:37:31,512 --> 00:37:32,953
No, I like the idea.

552
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:34,374
I like the idea.

553
00:37:36,676 --> 00:37:36,936
All right.

554
00:37:36,976 --> 00:37:37,877
That's something to think about.

555
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,703
In the meantime, we could put out a message to the committee and say, does anybody have any photos?

556
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:46,284
Yeah.

557
00:37:46,784 --> 00:37:47,145
Okay.

558
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:50,667
Maybe we can send out the full report.

559
00:37:50,707 --> 00:37:53,448
You could say we'd love to include photos if you have any.

560
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:58,591
Gee, that one didn't, when we went down to

561
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,781
Not walking court, where was it?

562
00:38:01,881 --> 00:38:02,442
Oh, yeah.

563
00:38:02,522 --> 00:38:03,442
Did I take pictures?

564
00:38:04,203 --> 00:38:09,666
I thought one of the people in charge of that place took a picture or something.

565
00:38:11,107 --> 00:38:12,828
Yeah, maybe they did.

566
00:38:13,048 --> 00:38:14,269
From the housing authority?

567
00:38:14,669 --> 00:38:15,509
Yes, right.

568
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:16,370
Right, exactly.

569
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,951
From one of the listening sessions?

570
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:18,411
Yeah.

571
00:38:21,113 --> 00:38:22,834
They say it would be anonymous.

572
00:38:23,194 --> 00:38:23,354
Right.

573
00:38:23,374 --> 00:38:26,796
I was going to say, would we- I don't know that I could use those.

574
00:38:26,876 --> 00:38:27,116
Yeah.

575
00:38:29,111 --> 00:38:35,396
I mean, I think what would be great is if we had, if we had a photo of the whole committee, that would be good.

576
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:39,019
Yeah.

577
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:49,828
So maybe we can, you know, I mean, it would have been great if we had thought about doing a group photo at that first information section when we were all there.

578
00:38:50,421 --> 00:38:52,783
Yeah, Wright's Pond or the- That was not- No.

579
00:38:53,023 --> 00:38:59,408
Wasn't there tables or any way they can take a clip off of that with everybody at the table or something?

580
00:38:59,608 --> 00:39:01,429
We could do that.

581
00:39:01,449 --> 00:39:08,314
Of course, that would have been John and I feel like there was somebody else who had to leave.

582
00:39:09,035 --> 00:39:10,496
Well, Laurel, right?

583
00:39:11,297 --> 00:39:11,477
Yeah.

584
00:39:11,497 --> 00:39:13,758
It would not have Phyllis and David.

585
00:39:13,778 --> 00:39:15,580
Yeah, that's true.

586
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:17,421
Yeah.

587
00:39:19,062 --> 00:39:19,583
Photoshop.

588
00:39:21,801 --> 00:39:23,722
Somebody with Photoshop skills.

589
00:39:25,723 --> 00:39:26,483
That's not me.

590
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:27,203
Maybe my son.

591
00:39:27,243 --> 00:39:28,284
Yeah, me neither.

592
00:39:29,804 --> 00:39:30,825
Well, that's something to think about.

593
00:39:30,885 --> 00:39:33,826
Maybe we can at some point, you know, take a committee photo.

594
00:39:34,926 --> 00:39:41,569
I'll bring it up at the meeting and see if, or I'll see what people think about having an in-person meeting in October.

595
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:42,849
I don't know.

596
00:39:43,649 --> 00:39:43,930
Okay.

597
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,491
Or I'll just ask on email.

598
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:49,972
I don't know if I want to take up meeting time with that.

599
00:39:51,163 --> 00:39:54,464
Or maybe it'll be such an efficient meeting that we'll have plenty of time.

600
00:39:54,484 --> 00:39:55,364
I don't know, though.

601
00:39:55,664 --> 00:39:57,085
We have a lot to go through Thursday.

602
00:39:57,745 --> 00:39:57,885
Yeah.

603
00:39:57,905 --> 00:40:00,666
Don't hold your breath on that.

604
00:40:01,246 --> 00:40:01,646
Come on.

605
00:40:02,946 --> 00:40:03,286
All right.

606
00:40:03,886 --> 00:40:04,187
All right.

607
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:05,167
I think we're good, then.

608
00:40:05,387 --> 00:40:07,928
I mean, we've done our part.

609
00:40:08,068 --> 00:40:09,988
Thank you for all this.

610
00:40:10,288 --> 00:40:10,908
It's great.

611
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:18,030
This is going to be really exciting when we have the whole thing put together and we see it in

612
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,771
all our work in this form.

613
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:25,052
I think it's awesome.

614
00:40:26,812 --> 00:40:27,993
You guys have done a great job.

615
00:40:28,013 --> 00:40:29,694
You spent a lot of time and effort on it.

616
00:40:31,795 --> 00:40:32,055
Yeah.

617
00:40:32,175 --> 00:40:32,455
All right.

618
00:40:33,315 --> 00:40:34,076
Good job, Nova.

619
00:40:34,796 --> 00:40:35,276
You too.

620
00:40:36,357 --> 00:40:36,857
Everybody.

621
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:37,997
Absolutely.

622
00:40:39,218 --> 00:40:39,538
All right.

623
00:40:39,658 --> 00:40:40,438
Thanks, guys.

624
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:41,619
See you Thursday.
