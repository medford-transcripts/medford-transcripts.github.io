    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=0.553">All</a>  right, welcome to the Medford Charter Study Final Report Subcommittee Meeting, July 29th, 2024. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=11.118">Did</a>  everyone have a chance to review the minutes?</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=14.74">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=16.101">I'll</a>  make a motion to accept those.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=18.582">Second.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=19.262">All</a>  in favor?</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=21.183">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=24.425">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=25.486">So,</a>  basically, we're just, I mean, thank you, Gene, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=31.712">those</a>  recommendation sections and also for your comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=37.855">I</a>  went through some of the drafts that I had written and made changes, so that was really helpful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=44.98">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=45.16">I</a>  think we're in good shape on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=48.222">Do</a>  you have any questions or comments about what you did, Gene or Maury?</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=52.284">Well,</a>  I did have a question, but Maury, did you have any thoughts or questions?</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=57.207">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=57.447">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=57.687">Nice</a>  job.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=59.147">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=60.388">I'd</a>  like to provide demographics from the survey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=63.369">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=65.951">In</a>  the community engagement section, because I feel like that would help respond to people's, the criticisms I've heard that it's not reflective of, and if it's not reflective, that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=78.898">I</a>  think that we're in a better position if we say it up front, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=83.642">So</a>  was David doing an analysis?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=86.685">Yeah,</a>  I need to figure out how to get in touch with David. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=90.208">I,</a>  you know, he said he was going to be around all summer, but he hasn't been responsive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=96.773">So</a>  we'll have to try to get in touch with him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=100.056">But</a>  we have like the, I mean, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=105.213">I</a>  can find them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=107.355">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=107.675">So</a>  you have the data. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=108.916">It's</a>  just a question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=110.077">He</a>  was going to make a survey report.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=112.099">That's</a>  what we asked him to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=114.04">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=115.001">I</a>  mean, I could do the analysis myself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=117.203">It</a>  would take time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=119.545">And</a>  if he's already doing it, I thought, well, then I don't need to.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=123.608">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=124.068">No,</a>  that's good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=129.813">So</a>  we should connect with Javid and see exactly what he's going to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=136.446">If</a>  David is unable to do the survey, he already created something for us that did not include the demographics that he shared at a meeting.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=149.311">At</a>  a full meeting?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=151.191">Yeah,</a>  at the full meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=154.072">That</a>  was a while back.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=155.533">I</a>  may have missed that.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=157.294">We'll</a>  look into that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=158.154">Because</a>  we have <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=163.731">the</a>  demographic pie charts, right, that the survey created? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=167.593">Oh,</a>  we do? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=169.373">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=170.013">I</a>  mean, I downloaded because I remember seeing the I thought the V was gonna put that all together.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=177.556">He's</a>  Yeah, we have to check with them.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=179.717">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=180.017">But</a>  there but Google, you know, Google surveys, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=184.785">did</a>  create pie charts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=186.906">Is</a>  it in the survey folder? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=188.727">That's</a>  a good question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=190.568">No,</a>  it might just be in the survey results. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=193.17">And</a>  it didn't get pulled. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=194.711">I</a>  can't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=195.551">Oh,</a>  jeez. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=197.112">Is</a>  that really? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=197.993">This</a>  must be new. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=200.414">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=200.814">I</a>  tried to minimize so I could look in the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=204.417">They</a>  said I can't minimize Zoom while I'm recording. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=207.298">That's</a>  never happened to me before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=208.619">It'd</a>  be a new thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=212.922">OK,</a>  so I'll look and see, because the other person, Danielle, created the survey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=219.989">So</a>  there's a certain way you can look at the survey results. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=225.154">And</a>  whenever I would look at the results, I would see the pie charts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=228.677">I</a>  assume it didn't go away.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=234.47">I</a>  was able to download an Excel spreadsheet with all the results. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=239.392">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=242.372">But</a>  I'm not the owner of the survey, so I don't know that I can see that.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=248.634">The</a>  person who could see it is Danielle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=252.635">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=253.375">But</a>  I should be able to see it because I think she gave me access to it, so I'm just trying to look for it right now.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=258.896">If</a>  you have that, that's fine because then I can just say, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=262.925">you</a>  know, 10% were, you know, 40% were renters or you know, whatever, because I think yeah, exactly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=271.813">Compare</a>  that to like Medford demographics if we have that and just to yeah, so we'll talk about how representative it is.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=283.403">So</a>  yeah, I see what's in the folder is just the Excel spreadsheet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=289.209">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=291.452">Yeah,</a>  so I know they exist because I saw them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=295.653">So</a>  let me ask Danielle about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=302.795">There</a>  might be a special way that I can maybe dig up the link she gave me a long time ago to look at the survey results, but I'll ask her. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=313.098">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=316.219">And</a>  the other important thing, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=321.627">to</a>  remember about that demographics info is that it include the percentage of people, I think it's in the pie chart, who said they didn't want to answer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=334.076">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=335.237">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=336.899">Because</a>  some people, because remember, we had prefer not to answer as an option. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=340.501">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=341.902">But</a>  I think that's in the pie chart. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=345.245">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=352.967">Okay,</a>  so Jen, did you have any other questions about or thoughts about what you put together?</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=363.414">No,</a>  with the Article 8, you know, citizen participation, I just did it broadly and I didn't, you know, go through each one or what it does. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=375.923">I</a>  think that's how we talked about presenting it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=379.666">Yes,</a>  definitely.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=382.121">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=383.102">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=383.643">I</a>  mean, and that one in particular was sort of challenging because it had all those different parts.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=394.679">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=395.16">So</a>  I just, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=397.571">said</a>  they include X, Y, Z, and then talked about the requirement that at the ballot, you need to show that you have at least 20 or 25% of the registered voters participating for it to be valid.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=413.917">So-</a>  I think, yeah, I think that's okay for that one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=417.538">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=418.298">Because</a>  it is pretty, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=426.027">thick</a>  when you get into the- I mean, you could break it down and say, do different recommendations for each one, but I think it makes sense to group them together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=441.214">I</a>  think it's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=442.675">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=444.916">I</a>  mean, if we broke them up, it would be like the referendum, the free petition, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=456.715">citizen</a>  initiative measures, citizen referendum measures, and then recall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=461.436">There</a>  would be like four, right?</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=464.197">Or</a>  you might want to lump citizen initiative and referendum together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=469.298">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=470.018">Because</a>  I think they have the same numbers, but then the referendum has different numbers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=477.139">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=480.52">Maybe</a>  it's worth doing that since recall is <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=485.878">going</a>  to be seen maybe as different than those things, but I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=490.319">What</a>  do you think, Maury?</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=492.34">I</a>  think recall should be by itself.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=494.76">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=496.801">We</a>  can keep the other three grouped the way it is, it's fine, but I think I'd pull recall out of there and just make it a separate line item and <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=507.097">You</a>  don't want to be linking it with everything else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=509.438">It's</a>  kind of like a horse of a different color, you know what I'm saying, by itself.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=513.04">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=513.76">No,</a>  I think that's a good point.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=517.102">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=518.382">Do</a>  you mind doing that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=520.103">No,</a>  I can rewrite that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=521.304">And</a>  we'll just have two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=522.904">We'll</a>  have like citizen initiative and then recall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=526.546">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=527.387">That's</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=528.207">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=528.627">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=530.668">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=532.449">So</a>  I think we're in pretty good shape. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=535.55">What</a>  else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=537.055">I've</a>  done a little bit, but I need to do more on putting all that public comment that we've collected with the survey and through emails into the issue sheets, that Google sheet, because we figured that that would be the easiest way to include it in the final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=561.333">Say</a>  that again, Milva?</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=562.454">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=563.355">We</a>  have a bunch of public comment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=566.177">Like</a>  the survey also gave people the opportunity to write, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=570.52">So,</a>  um, and you know, I mean, they're all kind of hard to access because they're in that Excel spreadsheet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=584.351">I</a>  was going to put them into the Google issue sheet under this under, you know, which, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=590.047">would</a>  represent a good amount of work, but it seemed like sort of the best way to give, to put that public comment into the final report was to have it consolidated into that issue sheets.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=602.81">Right,</a>  and have a link instead of attaching the issue sheet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=607.351">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=607.531">So</a>  here's a link to all the comment, like email. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=611.291">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=612.212">But</a>  maybe, do you think maybe if the public comments from the survey can be exported, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=623.269">Maybe</a>  we can just, I've never exported from, I don't know what the, it seems like there probably is a way to export them, right?</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=632.813">I</a>  feel like that's waiting comments received from the survey over all the other comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=638.795">Yeah,</a>  that's true. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=639.816">Though</a>  I don't like highlighting those and not highlighting</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=645.078">Right,</a>  public comment we got via email or other means like if I yeah, no, I was just thinking maybe you do you set up a link with with all different categories, whatever it is, and they can access if they want to see public comments, or if they want to see public emails, or they want. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=662.949">It's</a>  all there on one link and what's.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=666.285">Yeah,</a>  and that was the idea of the issue sheets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=669.268">I</a>  was just thinking of a way to lighten the workload, because transferring all those.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=673.751">But</a>  I can do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=674.832">I'll</a>  do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=675.853">Do</a>  you want help? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=676.714">I</a>  mean, I can help you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=679.136">We'll</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=679.596">I'll</a>  start it and see how it goes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=681.858">OK,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=682.799">I'm</a>  on vacation for like 10 days, mid-August. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=685.701">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=690.674">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=691.375">And,</a>  you know, there were a few comments that were sort of frivolous, and I don't know how we feel about, like, if we just make a judgment call, then I'll put those in the issue sheets.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=704.044">I</a>  think that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=705.165">There's,</a>  like, another category, but if they're not at all relevant, I don't think they should be included. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=710.869">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=711.27">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=711.41">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=713.7">I</a>  want to know what you're doing about fixing Mystic Avenue or something like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=718.561">It's</a>  not relevant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=719.642">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=720.282">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=721.162">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=721.682">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=722.222">That</a>  sounds good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=724.523">So</a>  basically, the main things we have to do now are put together the append, just sort of do this little bit of revision on sections, put together the appendix, which I started a folder and put the materials in it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=740.087">We'll</a>  have to figure out how to structure it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=744.267">Oh,</a>  I keep forgetting that I can't minimize anymore. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=749.811">Did</a>  you all see the appendix holder? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=752.853">Let's</a>  see, what's in there now? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=758.237">And</a>  there's probably more that needs to go in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=762.039">So,</a>  we could just, I don't know, have you ever made an appendix, Gene? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=773.542">Do</a>  you know what style? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=774.423">We</a>  don't really have to follow any particular style.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=779.024">I</a>  use Word and use their headings and a table of contents.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=791.889">We're</a>  going to have a table of contents for the whole report, but also a table of contents for the appendix because the appendix is going to be a lot of stuff in there.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=802.005">Yeah,</a>  you can put that in your main table of contents and then add links, click on it, and it'll take you to the sections if you use.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=812.628">So</a>  if you end up format, like doing formatting the whole thing and putting the table of contents in, will you do the appendix too? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=820.15">That</a>  means you would decide how to organize the appendix, which is fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=827.624">There</a>  aren't a lot of references to the appendix, but I did make a couple in the introductory letter, right, where I said I referenced a Collins Center memo and the generic modern charter, and then I just put appendix number or whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=846.175">I</a>  don't know how. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=847.375">It's</a>  sort of like a footnote, but not exactly.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=850.157">We</a>  can do the appendix in the order they're referenced in the document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=857.057">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=858.318">I</a>  don't know, or by section.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=861.839">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=862.9">So</a>  right now we'll just keep collecting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=865.521">And</a>  then the footnotes is the other thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=877.706">The</a>  footnotes are going to be before, maybe at the very end after the appendix.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=886.805">I</a>  had put them in the, let's see, I put mine in the, I think I had one footnote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=891.727">Oh,</a>  you put them within the recommendations.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=894.188">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=895.188">Oh,</a>  that's probably makes more, that, that makes more sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=898.19">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=898.89">Then</a>  I will footnote my recommendations too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=901.511">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=906.113">And</a>  then we don't have to have footnotes at the end. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=909.894">That's</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=911.735">I</a>  like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=912.255">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=915.737">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=919.933">Is</a>  there anything else that we were, that I mean, that we're supposed to, the call-in center offered to read the final report too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=929.481">So</a>  should we, should I just throw it together now in draft form and send it to them?</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=935.807">Maybe</a>  in case. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=937.348">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=939.47">Because</a>  I mean, you can just send them the link to the folder or something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=942.893">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=947.102">I</a>  can go through and clean up, because I see people made edits, so that it's cleaner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=953.444">Do</a>  you want to go through any of the edits? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=965.927">I</a>  didn't think there were any. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=970.469">I</a>  think you gave, like I had questions for you, like what languages?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=975.82">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=977.101">I</a>  told you that, right?</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=978.582">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=979.023">So</a>  I don't see any ones that we need to discuss. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=984.707">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=988.451">That's</a>  good that you put that in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=990.672">I</a>  asked Frances, but I haven't heard back yet about the translations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=995.416">But</a>  I know I have a bunch of the handouts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=999.88">There</a>  must be electronic versions of them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1005.939">Frances</a>  would have those because I only ever, we only ever got the hard copies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1009.642">I</a>  have the hard copies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1011.483">I</a>  suppose I could scan one.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1014.305">To</a>  put in the appendix or?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1016.047">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1016.747">Do</a>  we want to put them in the appendix? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1018.388">What</a>  do you think? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1020.59">Like,</a>  because we, we talk, did we talk about, do we need to put our flyer in the appendix? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1027.055">You</a>  know?</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1027.995">I</a>  don't, I don't, I'm, I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1031.558">I</a>  feel like you don't want to just put a ton of stuff in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1034.26">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1034.861">Exactly.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1036.356">I</a>  know, so maybe we just say that we did translation so we don't include all that stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1042.2">The</a>  flyers and the glossary, we had a glossary that was translated also.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1049.786">Right,</a>  okay, so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1055.663">A</a>  glossary with key terms?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1059.364">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1061.344">Like</a>  I said, I have them in the ad that I used to bring to all our events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1068.506">They're</a>  downstairs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1069.906">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1070.886">But</a>  yeah, we have flyers in different languages and then we have the glossary, which was just basic because remember we talked about how people wouldn't necessarily know even what a charter is or what word representation is and things like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1085.269">So</a>  it was just, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1095.519">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1103.366">I</a>  see in the Article 6, you had a question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1110.9">Yeah,</a>  you did have a couple comments maybe we should talk about the you don't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1115.343">Oh</a>  yeah, that's right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1116.624">Yeah,</a>  the annual meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1119.066">I</a>  thought it was an ordinance or that they were creating an ordinance.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1122.848">They</a>  did create an ordinance and the ordinance has been passed, but I don't know that that annual meeting is part of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1134.57">But</a>  isn't okay, so I could I mean there's a bunch of there's Yeah, there's a whole timeline in the budget ordinance for Different things but a meeting an annual meeting with all the branches of government.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1149.434">I</a>  I'm not sure that's it Okay And then you want wanted to know whether we should list the reasons we declined to adopt the <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1163.493">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1164.513">Budget</a>  lines. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1167.195">What</a>  do you think? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1174.598">Yeah,</a>  I think we could say that as it's prohibited by state law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1180.04">If</a>  we do that, should we cite it?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1185.602">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1185.922">I</a>  used to know all these numbers off the top of my head, but I'll find it.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1192.535">Okay,</a>  might do it as a footnote.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1195.576">Yeah,</a>  that works. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1197.257">Yes,</a>  I would footnote it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1199.538">That's</a>  the right way to go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1204.4">I'll</a>  find it.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1205.38">You'll</a>  find it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1206.081">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1209.682">I</a>  think I can find it pretty easily. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1211.123">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1214.984">Okay,</a>  so that's good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1218.646">And</a>  then <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1221.591">Everything</a>  else is pretty, like I, did I have any questions? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1230.979">Introductory</a>  now, article two, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1235.563">How</a>  do we end up, Bilba, on the? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1238.827">Ethics.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1239.428">What</a>  do we end up on that?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1243.25">We're</a>  voting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1243.831">We're</a>  going to talk about it and vote on it on Thursday.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1247.454">Thursday.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1247.874">Yeah,</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1248.354">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1248.654">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1249.915">I</a>  thought that's what we did, but I wasn't sure because it's been so much.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1253.398">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1253.738">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1257.104">Yeah,</a>  yeah, I was just reading over this the wardrobe is the article to when I was trying to I was thinking it would be good to put stats in about because I said It's the smallest in the state for a city of our size and if I could find exactly, you know, how many I think there's only two others And and you know the numbers on at-large versus Ward and then <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1285.01">hybrid,</a>  I don't know, I was thinking maybe of trying to find the stats on those, but I'm not sure how easy it will be to find them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1298.456">Cause</a>  you know, municipalities are sort of independent and I don't, the only organization I feel like that would keep those stats is the Massachusetts Municipal Association. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1309.862">And</a>  so I could look there, I'll look there.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1315.988">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1318.57">Don't</a>  we have a table with all 351 cities? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1320.852">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1320.912">We</a>  had a table with just about 50-60 cities.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1322.814">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1323.154">Which</a>  is, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1339.139">I</a>  mean, it's weird because there's some places, because the city town thing, like Framingham just became a city, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1348.283">So</a>  there's some towns that are probably really cities, but they haven't decided to call themselves cities yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1360.568">But</a>  mostly we were trying to compare municipalities that were more like us as opposed to, because towns will have <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1369.261">town</a>  meeting.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1372.664">Did</a>  you prepare that or did Collins Center prepare it?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1376.607">No,</a>  I actually found that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1380.751">It</a>  was prepared by problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1382.853">I</a>  don't know exactly who prepared it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1386.476">I</a>  got it off the Somerville Charter Study website, their materials, and then I double-checked each one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1396.723">But</a>  it's really hard actually because sometimes the websites aren't up to date and when you look online for a charter to check and make sure that the composition is what that chart said, sometimes the charters online aren't the most, so I did it to the best of my ability. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1416.632">But</a>  Somerville's committee had two part-time employees, so I'm guessing they put it together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1423.935">I</a>  think that's probably who put it together.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1427.351">I</a>  don't know if anyone wants to get in the weeds on it, but it'd be nice to provide to someone if they wanted to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1432.713">I</a>  know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1434.594">At</a>  other cities and towns just to see where Medford stands and look at the data themselves. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1442.597">It</a>  is useful.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1444.397">Like</a>  I said, it's hard sometimes to keep it updated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1450.46">When</a>  I was looking up, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1452.327">Because</a>  I wanted to double check everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1453.888">And</a>  there were some cities that said, or one or two, I think it was Brockton, that said four-year term for mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1460.852">When</a>  I looked in their charter, it said two-year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1464.034">And</a>  their charter hadn't been updated on the website or something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1470.468">Because</a>  it was very recent that they switched to four year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1473.41">And</a>  then I'm actually unclear on whether some places could switch to four year with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1478.893">I</a>  mean, there's so many processes that are involved.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1483.375">I</a>  think our laws have not been updated in the last couple of years because we don't have a city solicitor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1490.244">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1491.585">So</a>  like the things that have been passed have not been put on our website because they want to review them before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1498.391">So</a>  maybe that's in other cities that.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1501.373">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1502.014">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1502.674">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1504.756">So</a>  so I think it's pretty accurate, but, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1510.461">We</a>  maybe could include it with the caveat that that it was created in 20, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1516.085">I</a>  don't know, when did I do it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1520.32">Probably,</a>  yeah, we could put a date on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1524.164">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1524.805">We</a>  could include it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1525.826">I</a>  mean, I think it's mostly accurate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1527.828">There</a>  might be a couple of things that are changed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1531.732">But</a>  it still gives the sense of, it shows you kind of visually, oh, wow, look. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1540.636">We're</a>  only one of a few that don't have ward representation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1545.598">It</a>  shows you the size of the councils. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1547.798">It</a>  shows you the size of the school committees. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1549.839">I</a>  think it was really helpful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1553.88">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1554.781">And</a>  even the ward representation, there's only a few cities that don't have it, and Cambridge is one of them, which this isn't in the chart, of course. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1563.204">But</a>  Cambridge has ranked choice voting, which, you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1569.594">So</a>  even though they have at large, they also have a process that kind of mitigates the potential issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1579.5">Because</a>  interestingly, in the Lowell lawsuit, in the settlement, one of the options for Lowell was to go to rank choice voting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1591.226">They</a>  said either ward representation or rank choice voting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1595.946">And</a>  they did the word representation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1602.872">I</a>  thought that was interesting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1604.513">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1608.056">Okay,</a>  so maybe we'll put that in the appendix. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1610.758">I'll</a>  put it in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1611.519">I'll</a>  put it in the appendix folder.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1615.161">Or</a>  like a link to it, because people might want to... Yeah, I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1621.246">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1622.457">Well,</a>  it's not that big. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1624.819">It's</a>  not like a huge document.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1625.879">It's</a>  an Excel file. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1627.12">If</a>  you're putting together the appendix, then can you just choose to put some of the things in as links and some of them as whatever?</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1639.247">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1639.628">Right?</a> </p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1640.668">We'll</a>  have to, like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1642.734">Change</a>  access to the ones we want to share. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1646.598">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1647.299">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1648.2">Or</a>  maybe.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1648.821">And</a>  if I need, does the owner have to do that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1652.705">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1653.707">So</a>  if I need to do that, you can just let me know.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1655.789">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1658.432">But</a>  I'll put it in the folder for now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1661.335">And</a>  you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1663.174">If</a>  the time comes when we're making the appendix and we decide, you know what, we don't really need this in the appendix, we can just not include it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1671.236">But</a>  right now, we'll just lean on putting things in the folder that we think we might include. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1677.118">Because</a>  we have a lot of materials. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1679.559">We</a>  do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1684.68">I</a>  think we're pretty good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1687.201">Is</a>  there anything else we need to do? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1692.138">Well,</a>  so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1692.738">We</a>  have to decide when we're going to give it to the committee.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1697.942">Is</a>  it now my turn to put in, am I putting it in a full document or is Daveed doing that or? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1706.187">Putting</a>  what? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1708.088">Merging</a>  it all into one report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1710.15">Am</a>  I doing that now? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1711.45">That's</a>  a good question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1712.471">Or</a>  are we letting people, like do you want the call-in center, let people edit it first?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1719.126">I</a>  would like, I'm going to give the Collins Center a draft version, and I was going to just throw it in a document for them, but that won't be the final document, whatever you, because you're going to figure out how to put it in, so you can format it right and stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1732.494">But</a>  if you want to do that, because we, because the other thing we have to do is share it with the committee, with the wider committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1737.977">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1739.838">So</a>  we can either, we can do that now, we can share the folder with them, and they can just look at it in pieces, or we can put it all together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1748.063">What</a>  do you think?</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1749.732">I</a>  mean, I have time now, so I could try to put it in a file. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1753.673">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1755.294">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1759.295">See</a>  how far I can get.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1761.196">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1762.176">The</a>  only thing I would like, let's see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1768.278">I'm</a>  just thinking about just the stuff that has to be little changes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1779.91">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1782.831">Yeah,</a>  like the stuff that's in highlighted, would you just keep the highlights or? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1787.032">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1787.992">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1789.152">And</a>  then we. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1791.093">And</a>  then we don't work in this anymore and we work in that document.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1797.235">Yeah,</a>  so the one thing about Google Docs and Word, they don't play nice always. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1804.737">Just</a>  FYI. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1809.122">As</a>  a consultant, most of my stuff I'm doing with Teams because that's a Microsoft product. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1815.904">It</a>  acts a little better. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1819.625">Just</a>  know that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1820.905">It's</a>  just a warning.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1821.885">I</a>  think we can still do it this way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1827.786">You</a>  mean some of the comments might not transfer?</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1830.667">Sometimes</a>  the formatting, it gets all, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1835.037">Messed</a>  up, we can see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1838.62">Or</a>  the footnotes, you can't see the footnotes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1840.821">They</a>  disappear, but they're there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1842.503">It</a>  just doesn't always, perhaps purposefully, they don't always... I could make it a PDF and then put it up, but then it's hard to edit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1860.455">Anyways.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1861.375">Well,</a>  I'm just wondering, I mean, in one sense, it makes sense for you to do it now in case you have to sort of make changes and whatnot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1870.978">But</a>  on the other hand, if we need to keep working on it, should we wait until we're done with the edits? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1878.88">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1880.261">What</a>  do you think?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1884.442">Hm.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1887.583">I</a>  mean. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1889.247">We</a>  would like to give the full committee one document to look at and not sections. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1894.511">Is</a>  that?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1894.872">I</a>  think it's okay to give the committee, you know, to tell them to just go into the folder and look at the different sections. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1901.957">I</a>  think that's okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1903.118">What</a>  do you think, Maury?</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1905.22">Yeah,</a>  I think so too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1906.861">You</a>  know, soon to be like a lot of maybe extra work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1911.385">We</a>  don't have to do work that's already been done to try to put it together on one whole draft form just for the committee.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1917.722">Yeah,</a>  because if it's going to maybe create potential issues for our final editing and stuff to move it now, then maybe we should wait. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1926.047">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1926.328">But</a>  what do you think?</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1928.589">Yeah,</a>  I think it might be easier if we share the pieces. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1931.891">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1938.749">Because</a>  there might be more might be more work to try to create 1 document, put it online, then there's issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1945.652">Then</a>  we have to that's what I'm thinking.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1947.412">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1948.393">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1948.833">So</a>  we'll keep it the way it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1951.314">And,</a>  um. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1954.715">Maybe</a>  we'll wait until after this next meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1957.676">I</a>  guess what. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1960.747">When</a>  should I just tell the committee, you know, feel free to look over the final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1966.273">We're</a>  not, it's not on the agenda for Thursday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1968.756">We</a>  can tell them, maybe what we'll do is make it on the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1973.861">What</a>  we have, what's on the agenda is, yeah, what's on the agenda is for us to give a report to the committee so we can just tell the committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1981.905">you</a>  know, we have a pretty, we have a draft. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1983.766">I</a>  mean, we do, we have, you know, a completed draft of the final report and, um, that I will be sending them a link so that they can look at it and then give them a timeline to make any changes or comments or edits.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=1999.013">And,</a>  uh, cause we're in the process of closing this.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2003.155">And</a>  then we'll, um, and then we'll, we'll sort of vote it through at the September meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2008.898">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2010.153">Yeah,</a>  I'd wait till after our meeting because people are doing the draft charter now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2015.714">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2016.054">No,</a>  I'm just saying I will tell them at the meeting that this is going to be the process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2023.395">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2025.636">And</a>  then they'll have that time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2026.996">And</a>  we're going to have to see how it goes on Thursday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2030.397">I</a>  think we can do this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2033.637">We</a>  can finish it at our October meeting without having to have an extra meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2037.818">But</a>  we'll see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2040.363">I</a>  mean, the whole committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2042.504">So</a>  as far as we are concerned, we pretty much have our tasks, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2048.208">I</a>  don't think we... I mean, we're done with the draft. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2051.59">There's</a>  just putting together, you know, the appendix materials and I have to add a few footnotes and... You're going to get the survey percent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2065.598">Yeah,</a>  I'll talk to Danielle, try to get in touch with David. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2071.364">And</a>  I think we're good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2073.545">What</a>  do you think? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2075.747">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2077.988">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2078.848">So</a>  I'm going to send it to the Collins Center if they have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2082.39">I</a>  don't anticipate that they're going to say much about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2085.132">I'll</a>  just share their comments when they say if they have anything that makes us think we need to make big changes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2100.992">But</a>  I don't think that will happen.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2103.495">We</a>  didn't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2103.935">Did</a>  we take any pictures or?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2105.517">I</a>  know, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2108.561">I</a>  mean, we must have had pictures at Wright's Pond. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2114.848">There's</a>  a picture. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2118.267">I</a>  think there's one picture I can think of from Wright's Pond because it was taken by Matt when he was running it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2126.909">Yeah,</a>  that one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2128.509">But</a>  I feel like maybe Ron took pictures. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2131.39">I'm</a>  really bad at taking pictures. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2133.95">Maybe</a>  Danielle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2136.151">Ron</a>  or Danielle might have taken pictures at Wright's Pond. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2139.031">We</a>  didn't take any that day at the farmer's market, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2141.592">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2144.1">And</a>  I don't know any of the hearings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2145.761">I</a>  guess we could do screen grabs from the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2149.724">You're</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2150.244">It</a>  would be kind of nice to include pictures.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2154.628">We</a>  needed a committee photographer.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2157.229">Or</a>  just like a picture of all of the committee members. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2162.113">That</a>  would be good.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2163.234">But</a>  since we've never actually been in a room together, right, all of us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2167.737">Well,</a>  we did actually. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2168.878">We</a>  were at City Hall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2170.999">Maybe</a>  we can.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2173.457">meet</a>  when we are near the end or something.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2177.36">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2177.72">And</a>  if it's not a meeting and we don't talk at all about charter, we just going, getting together for a photo, I think it's okay.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2187.486">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2188.527">Because</a>  it's not, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2190.368">We're</a>  not going to, we're not going to have any discussions or any picture. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2194.19">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2194.551">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2196.532">Um,</a>  you know, there's all, it's, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2200.433">Yeah,</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2201.474">We</a>  could get together for a social event, but I don't even know how coached that would be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2205.336">I</a>  guess I'd have to ask someone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2208.158">Or</a>  we could just post it publicly and say, public for a photo. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2217.424">As</a>  long as we post it, we're fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2220.706">But</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2222.107">I</a>  don't know how easy it would be to get everybody together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2224.849">Last</a>  meeting in October could be in person. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2229.917">That</a>  sounds like a good idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2232.399">That</a>  might be what to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2234.42">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2235.161">But</a>  we might not have everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2236.862">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2240.144">Photoshop,</a>  right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2243.947">Photoshop</a>  people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2246.389">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2247.129">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2247.589">Let's</a>  think about it.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2249.671">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2250.091">Just</a>  a thought. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2250.652">It's</a>  not a big deal.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2251.512">No,</a>  I like the idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2252.973">I</a>  like the idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2256.676">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2256.976">That's</a>  something to think about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2259.44">In</a>  the meantime, we could put out a message to the committee and say, does anybody have any photos?</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2264.583">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2266.784">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2267.725">Maybe</a>  we can send out the full report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2270.707">You</a>  could say we'd love to include photos if you have any.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2274.649">Gee,</a>  that one didn't, when we went down to <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2280.22">Not</a>  walking court, where was it?</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2281.881">Oh,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2282.522">Did</a>  I take pictures? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2284.203">I</a>  thought one of the people in charge of that place took a picture or something.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2291.107">Yeah,</a>  maybe they did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2293.048">From</a>  the housing authority? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2294.669">Yes,</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2295.609">Right,</a>  exactly.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2296.61">From</a>  one of the listening sessions? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2298.031">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2301.113">They</a>  say it would be anonymous. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2303.194">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2303.374">I</a>  was going to say, would we- I don't know that I could use those. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2306.876">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2309.111">I</a>  mean, I think what would be great is if we had, if we had a photo of the whole committee, that would be good.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2318.659">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2319.52">So</a>  maybe we can, you know, I mean, it would have been great if we had thought about doing a group photo at that first information section when we were all there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2330.421">Yeah,</a>  Wright's Pond or the- That was not- No.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2333.023">Wasn't</a>  there tables or any way they can take a clip off of that with everybody at the table or something?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2339.608">We</a>  could do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2341.449">Of</a>  course, that would have been John and I feel like there was somebody else who had to leave. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2349.035">Well,</a>  Laurel, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2351.297">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2351.497">It</a>  would not have Phyllis and David.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2353.778">Yeah,</a>  that's true.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2357.101">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2359.062">Photoshop.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2361.801">Somebody</a>  with Photoshop skills.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2365.723">That's</a>  not me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2366.823">Maybe</a>  my son.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2367.243">Yeah,</a>  me neither. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2369.804">Well,</a>  that's something to think about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2370.885">Maybe</a>  we can at some point, you know, take a committee photo. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2374.926">I'll</a>  bring it up at the meeting and see if, or I'll see what people think about having an in-person meeting in October. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2382.489">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2384.59">Or</a>  I'll just ask on email. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2386.651">I</a>  don't know if I want to take up meeting time with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2391.163">Or</a>  maybe it'll be such an efficient meeting that we'll have plenty of time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2394.484">I</a>  don't know, though. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2395.664">We</a>  have a lot to go through Thursday.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2397.745">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2397.905">Don't</a>  hold your breath on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2401.246">Come</a>  on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2402.946">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2403.886">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2404.367">I</a>  think we're good, then.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2405.387">I</a>  mean, we've done our part.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2408.068">Thank</a>  you for all this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2410.288">It's</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2412.889">This</a>  is going to be really exciting when we have the whole thing put together and we see it in <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2421.69">all</a>  our work in this form. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-subcommittee-07-29-24&start=2423.791">I</a>  think it's awesome.</p>
