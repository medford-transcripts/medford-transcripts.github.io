[SPEAKER_05]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

35
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:10,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Report of the secretary.

36
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:13,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Report of committees.

37
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:14,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Committee of the whole.

38
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:16,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Superintendent's evaluation, school year 2015-16.

39
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:25,269
[SPEAKER_05]: We held a committee of the whole back on June 2nd to evaluate our superintendent.

40
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:33,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Several of us had, well, all of us had comments and gave our ratings by the classification items 1, 2, 3, and 4.

41
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:39,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Overall, the total average was a 3.87 for the superintendent.

42
00:01:40,418 --> 00:01:42,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to see if there's anything to highlight.

43
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion that's highly, high proficient?

44
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:59,574
[SPEAKER_05]: So motion to approve, accept the report and place on file, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

45
00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:00,354
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

46
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:02,155
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

47
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:02,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

48
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:09,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Community participation has been withdrawn.

49
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Report of the superintendent, report on administrative work week.

50
00:02:19,954 --> 00:02:28,637
[SPEAKER_11]: And our members of the committee will call on our Deputy Superintendent to tell us about the Administrative Work Week, which will take place beginning on Wednesday of this week.

51
00:02:28,657 --> 00:02:31,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

52
00:02:31,078 --> 00:02:32,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy summer to everyone.

53
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:37,721
[SPEAKER_01]: We are kind of getting ready to say goodbye to our students.

54
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:39,721
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, our administrators stay at work.

55
00:02:40,622 --> 00:02:44,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them work throughout the summer doing different things, hiring.

56
00:02:44,423 --> 00:02:45,343
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things come up.

57
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:48,425
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not sure when the state testing results are coming in.

58
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:49,305
[SPEAKER_01]: So when that happens,

59
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:50,953
[SPEAKER_01]: people are back at work.

60
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:56,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Officially, we have five days after the students get out of school where administrators meet.

61
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,817
[SPEAKER_01]: This happens each year.

62
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:03,599
[SPEAKER_01]: And during these meetings, we debrief on what's gone on this past school year.

63
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:13,763
[SPEAKER_01]: We make our plans for the upcoming school year, try to start to make plans, and engage in trainings that are relevant to some of our new initiatives.

64
00:03:14,755 --> 00:03:24,461
[SPEAKER_01]: The schedule provides time to meet individually with administrators to address any end of year concerns that are specific to their schools or departments.

65
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:32,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And this year, our meetings start the day after school gets out, the 22nd, and they continue through Tuesday, June 28th.

66
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:36,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, a variety of topics will be covered this year.

67
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:43,652
[SPEAKER_01]: We will talk about budget, how we're going to make it all fit, scheduling, personnel issues,

68
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:58,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Administrators now will receive training that week in School Brains, which is going to replace I-PASS, and also in ASOP, which is the new program and protocol for hiring substitute teachers.

69
00:03:59,317 --> 00:04:04,680
[SPEAKER_01]: We also plan to spend substantial time on the teacher evaluation system.

70
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe it or not, it's still growing and emerging with DDMs.

71
00:04:09,022 --> 00:04:11,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the district-determined measures.

72
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:17,616
[SPEAKER_01]: A next part of this is that students have input into teacher self-assessment.

73
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:21,137
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we are still, the system is growing and growing and growing.

74
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:26,579
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want our administrators to be on board with some of the new things that need to be implemented.

75
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:34,321
[SPEAKER_01]: We will also focus on some of the new developments related to the new state test, MCAS 2.0.

76
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:39,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we don't have a lot of information about what that test is going to look like.

77
00:04:39,723 --> 00:04:45,746
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know that it is planned to be implemented in the spring, so hopefully information will be forthcoming.

78
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:52,609
[SPEAKER_01]: We find that these end-of-year meetings with administrative staff provide time for quality collaboration.

79
00:04:53,690 --> 00:05:05,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Administrators have opportunities to speak with one another, to share best practices, and we also ask administrators to suggest topics that they would like us to pursue.

80
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:08,297
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of that has been taking place this past week.

81
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,952
[SPEAKER_01]: We present topics and materials for administrators to reflect on.

82
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:21,856
[SPEAKER_01]: We give them homework during the summer and we ask them to bring back some of their reflections at our opening meetings that happen five days before school opens.

83
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:29,119
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a relatively short summer as administrators close out the end of June and come back really almost mid-August.

84
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, as I mentioned, most people, most administrators work throughout the summer.

85
00:05:35,162 --> 00:05:37,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's in and out, doing hiring.

86
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:39,968
[SPEAKER_01]: attending to ordering materials, and so on.

87
00:05:40,668 --> 00:05:54,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Officially, administrators return on August 22nd, which is a week before school begins, and then we will be holding meetings throughout that week, the 22nd to the 26th, so we'll be ready to open school on the 29th.

88
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:58,596
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's our schedule, very busy, very ambitious, but very productive.

89
00:05:58,676 --> 00:06:00,997
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I can answer any questions, I'll be more than happy to.

90
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:02,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any questions?

91
00:06:04,585 --> 00:06:04,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

92
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:05,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion?

93
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:10,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to receive in place on file by offered by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

94
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:10,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Van de Kloot.

95
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,327
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

96
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:11,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

97
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:12,888
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

98
00:06:13,428 --> 00:06:14,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

99
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on merger of the GBL with Northeast Athletic Conference.

100
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:29,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, as you know, for a period of time now, the GBL has diminished in its size as various members opted to go with different leagues in the area.

101
00:06:30,314 --> 00:06:33,295
[SPEAKER_11]: That meant Medford, Somerville, Malden, and Everett

102
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:38,193
[SPEAKER_11]: had become the remaining members of the GBL.

103
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:45,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Scheduling and creating athletic opportunities for young people within the GBL becomes progressively difficult.

104
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:50,583
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to find teams outside of our area, and every year it's a different situation.

105
00:06:50,643 --> 00:07:02,453
[SPEAKER_11]: It also deprives our youngsters of competing against other students in other communities that could take on sports that maybe the GBL members choose not to participate in at a particular time.

106
00:07:03,117 --> 00:07:04,698
[SPEAKER_11]: So our athletic director is here.

107
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,461
[SPEAKER_11]: We are looking to merge with the NEC, the Northeast Conference.

108
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:16,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Many of the schools in the Northeast Conference once belonged to us, like Revere, and Peabody, and places like that.

109
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:28,531
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're looking to go to that at this point in time and see if we can't make sure that we have a robust league for our students to play in over the next several years.

110
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:30,072
[SPEAKER_11]: It wouldn't start till the spring.

111
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:32,627
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have the fall to get used to it.

112
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:34,928
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't affect the Medford-Malden football game.

113
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:43,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Simultaneously, I just want to mention while we're talking about this is that Jack Dempsey, our softball coach, was named the Boston Globe Coach of the Year.

114
00:07:43,816 --> 00:07:46,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations, Jack.

115
00:07:46,118 --> 00:07:58,868
[SPEAKER_11]: And several of our players, senior Ashley Eisner, girls softball, named the Boston Globe's, and Boston knows all scholastic girls softball team, girls softball, girls tennis team, and lacrosse, boys lacrosse are GBL champions.

116
00:08:00,094 --> 00:08:05,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are some highlights from the sports side of things, and if you have any questions, Ms.

117
00:08:05,697 --> 00:08:07,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Maloney and I can try to answer them for you.

118
00:08:11,482 --> 00:08:18,627
[SPEAKER_09]: So prior to our budget night, I had no idea that we were moving in this direction.

119
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,108
[SPEAKER_09]: We hadn't really been apprised of this along the way.

120
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:29,293
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't really understand whether this requires a vote of the school committee to affirm the decision.

121
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:32,295
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's a decision or it's just what is happening.

122
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:34,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you perhaps explain that?

123
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:41,521
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, obviously, anytime we make a move of this type and change our affiliations, we would like your endorsement.

124
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:50,925
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not sure that it does, because you basically allow us to play any team and, you know, in the area, as long as they're governed by the MIAA and the like.

125
00:08:51,385 --> 00:08:53,567
[SPEAKER_11]: But it certainly would be a good idea if you did.

126
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:56,968
[SPEAKER_09]: So just out of curiosity, are there other options?

127
00:08:57,048 --> 00:08:59,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is this the option?

128
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:00,850
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the option.

129
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,630
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the option.

130
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,872
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been trying for an extended period of time to form a league.

131
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:13,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but very few, the middle six league would only take us and not Malden and Everett and then Cambridge bolted to.

132
00:09:13,695 --> 00:09:15,996
[SPEAKER_11]: another week and Waltham bolted to another week.

133
00:09:16,016 --> 00:09:19,637
[SPEAKER_11]: So before you know it, we were down teams instead of having a robust.

134
00:09:19,657 --> 00:09:20,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.

135
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:22,158
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that was just, you know, dissipated.

136
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:34,362
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess I'd like to ask, uh, Mr Maloney, whether any sports will be impacted, for example, uh, will right now our swimming season is during the winter.

137
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:39,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but I know some schools have different swimming seasons.

138
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:41,124
[SPEAKER_09]: So does anybody, anything change for us?

139
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:43,009
[SPEAKER_13]: As of today, nothing changes.

140
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:47,231
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll be meeting in September with the principals and the athletic directors.

141
00:09:47,812 --> 00:09:49,052
[SPEAKER_13]: There'll be 16 teams.

142
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:52,575
[SPEAKER_13]: The plan on paper right now is there's 16 teams.

143
00:09:52,735 --> 00:09:59,319
[SPEAKER_13]: There'll be two divisions of eight, and they'll seat us according to the sport, according to the strength of our team.

144
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:01,980
[SPEAKER_13]: There's going to be a north and a south.

145
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:04,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, the north is going to be the more powerful one.

146
00:10:05,302 --> 00:10:07,944
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's going to be a competitive 16-team league.

147
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,206
[SPEAKER_13]: As of right now, nothing should change with our schedule.

148
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:13,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

149
00:10:13,722 --> 00:10:15,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we know if we're in the North or the South?

150
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:18,004
[SPEAKER_13]: Every sport's going to be different.

151
00:10:18,445 --> 00:10:21,447
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're assuming that we're going to be in the upper tier in most sports.

152
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:27,531
[SPEAKER_13]: We're pretty competitive in most of the sports that they have right now.

153
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:30,092
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

154
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:30,753
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

155
00:10:30,773 --> 00:10:31,113
[SPEAKER_17]: Cuno.

156
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:32,194
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

157
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:36,336
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Maloney, I know that you said there's 16 teams.

158
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:37,477
[SPEAKER_17]: Could you tell us the cities?

159
00:10:37,977 --> 00:10:38,518
[SPEAKER_17]: I know it's us.

160
00:10:39,288 --> 00:10:42,709
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the four GBL teams Method, Malden, Everett, and Somerville.

161
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:44,689
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we have the whole North Shore.

162
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:45,650
[SPEAKER_13]: We have the two Lynn's.

163
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Lynn Classical, Lynn English.

164
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:55,332
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Winthrop, Revere, Salem, Marblehead, Swampskid, Gloucester, Peabody, and Danvers.

165
00:10:55,752 --> 00:10:56,092
[SPEAKER_17]: That's 16.

166
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:56,672
[SPEAKER_17]: And Gloucester.

167
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:58,733
[SPEAKER_13]: And Saugus.

168
00:10:58,753 --> 00:10:59,253
[SPEAKER_13]: Saugus too.

169
00:10:59,313 --> 00:10:59,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that 16?

170
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:00,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

171
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:04,574
[SPEAKER_13]: And Gloucester is the furthest for our students?

172
00:11:04,614 --> 00:11:06,515
[SPEAKER_13]: Will be the furthest trip, correct.

173
00:11:06,835 --> 00:11:07,035
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

174
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:07,915
[SPEAKER_17]: Is this going to impact?

175
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:18,685
[SPEAKER_17]: being that there's going to be more competitions, there's going to be more games, is this going to affect our busing and our budget on our busing?

176
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:21,047
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going all over the state right now to get games.

177
00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:23,888
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't think it's going to affect the bus schedule.

178
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:30,511
[SPEAKER_13]: And for the far trips, we're going to try to get creative in the fall.

179
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:32,992
[SPEAKER_13]: We can do stuff during school vacation week.

180
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:34,593
[SPEAKER_13]: We can do stuff on Saturdays.

181
00:11:36,444 --> 00:11:39,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Baseball and softball, the weather, they may be able to do double headers.

182
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:44,517
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to try to get creative and everybody's on the same page.

183
00:11:44,577 --> 00:11:48,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Perella, school comes first, athletics second.

184
00:11:48,202 --> 00:11:49,484
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll make sure we work it out.

185
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:52,593
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, because I was just concerned.

186
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:59,175
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I know that we've traveled far now, depending on who we've competed against.

187
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:07,196
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just very concerned, especially after a regular day of school, going really, really far away and then trying to come back home.

188
00:12:08,357 --> 00:12:09,097
[SPEAKER_17]: That's always something.

189
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:11,897
[SPEAKER_17]: But my concern was also the buses.

190
00:12:11,957 --> 00:12:15,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Even though we are using buses now, we are going everywhere with

191
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,843
[SPEAKER_17]: going from four teams to 16 teams is going to be a lot more games.

192
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:22,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the games won't change.

193
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Hockey will still play a 20-game schedule.

194
00:12:25,724 --> 00:12:27,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Soccer will play an 18.

195
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:29,605
[SPEAKER_13]: So the games won't change.

196
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:31,625
[SPEAKER_17]: So the amount of games won't change.

197
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:34,326
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just going to be more competitive itself.

198
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:34,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

199
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:35,306
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

200
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,367
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can probably give Pat some homework to do.

201
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:38,607
[SPEAKER_13]: She'll get us in competitive bus deal.

202
00:12:40,077 --> 00:12:42,059
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, Bobby, maybe you'll start driving the bus.

203
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very happy with the kids.

204
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:50,145
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm really happy with the kids having more competitiveness.

205
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,767
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's a really good thing.

206
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:55,690
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a motion on the floor to receive and place on file by Mr. Scarry.

207
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second?

208
00:12:57,271 --> 00:12:58,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

209
00:12:59,874 --> 00:13:01,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for roll call vote.

210
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

211
00:13:12,095 --> 00:13:12,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

212
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:16,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Recommendation to approve community schools fee structure.

213
00:13:17,957 --> 00:13:25,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we have provided to you a fee structure for community schools as you have requested.

214
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,862
[SPEAKER_11]: You have previously approved the rules and regs for the rentals of facilities.

215
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,002
[SPEAKER_11]: There are some

216
00:13:31,548 --> 00:13:43,594
[SPEAKER_11]: additional items here that were made to accommodate youth groups and also some community groups that might not have the resources necessary to access our facilities on a regular basis.

217
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:47,516
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've tried to take into account the things that have been provided to us.

218
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:52,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Pat Velie is here to talk about this particular issue.

219
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:56,419
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mr. Maloney is also here as the director of community schools.

220
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:02,684
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to have Pat take you through the changes that we've made so that you can go over them.

221
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:06,647
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can decide if we're going to go forward with this particular schedule.

222
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:08,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everybody.

223
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:13,293
[SPEAKER_02]: So you find attached, we've already approved the wording.

224
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:15,214
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll go straight into the fee structure.

225
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:18,517
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll point out the changes that have been made to accommodate

226
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:22,889
[SPEAKER_02]: certain requests and items that I was not aware of the first round.

227
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:32,612
[SPEAKER_02]: In the theater technician, we were charging $40 an hour and then splitting out the cost of the mics and anything else that might be used.

228
00:14:33,132 --> 00:14:38,394
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to go with a flat $75 an hour rate, and then we'll use that money to replace any equipment.

229
00:14:38,854 --> 00:14:39,074
[SPEAKER_02]: All right?

230
00:14:40,794 --> 00:14:47,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Below the MHS cafeteria and the classroom, we've allowed for regular scheduled MPS Booster Club meetings.

231
00:14:47,617 --> 00:14:49,017
[SPEAKER_02]: They're exempt from the rental fee.

232
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:56,741
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason both rooms are selected is many times the parents just outnumber that classroom, so we have to move them into a small cafeteria.

233
00:14:56,761 --> 00:14:57,801
[SPEAKER_02]: All right?

234
00:14:59,802 --> 00:15:02,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing else changes until you get down to Edgerly Field.

235
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:11,665
[SPEAKER_02]: We kept the fee consistent across the board because that is how the Hormel charges, and we want to remain competitive with our neighbors right now.

236
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:21,672
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you go to the third page, which is number 8 of 12, options added.

237
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:26,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Groups grandfathered in include the Medford Youth Soccer and Medford Youth Lacrosse.

238
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:31,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Rates for grandfathered in users are $75 an hour, practice on Edgeley Field,

239
00:15:32,393 --> 00:15:33,654
[SPEAKER_02]: and $100 an hour for games.

240
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Rental space is based on availability of field.

241
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:45,180
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one, Medford community-based non-profit groups may apply to rent facilities for $75 an hour.

242
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:55,566
[SPEAKER_02]: If a custodian, tech assistants, et cetera, is on duty, if custodial tech assistants, et cetera, are required to be hired, the posted fees for such services apply.

243
00:15:56,146 --> 00:16:00,068
[SPEAKER_02]: A letter of non-profit status is required at time of rental.

244
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:10,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Third one, registered MPS booster organizations will be allowed available times, times not otherwise booked, at the gymnasiums and Edgeley Field.

245
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:16,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It is expected that these MPS booster organizations provide significant MPS team support.

246
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:23,717
[SPEAKER_02]: This free of charge time assumes no special cost, again, no custodial, tech assistance, et cetera.

247
00:16:24,378 --> 00:16:27,260
[SPEAKER_02]: If custodial, tech assistance, et cetera are required to be hired,

248
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:29,869
[SPEAKER_02]: The posted fees for such services apply.

249
00:16:30,669 --> 00:16:34,291
[SPEAKER_02]: All booster groups will be required to register with community schools.

250
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:37,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, community subsidy.

251
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:46,336
[SPEAKER_02]: To underwrite City of Medford nonprofit groups requesting theater use outside of regular school hours, MPS will ask for a subsidy for user discounts.

252
00:16:46,995 --> 00:16:51,279
[SPEAKER_02]: school committee will be asked to approve each request at the next regularly scheduled meeting.

253
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:55,362
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last change is second from the bottom of that list.

254
00:16:55,842 --> 00:17:06,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Should the city of Medford revise the rental rates for Hormel Stadium, a discussion should also ensue related to the Edgeley Field rental rates, therefore providing enough notice for current renters.

255
00:17:08,553 --> 00:17:09,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take questions.

256
00:17:12,876 --> 00:17:14,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your work on this, Pat.

257
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:20,231
[SPEAKER_03]: So my first question is the price for Edgeley Field.

258
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:25,914
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make sure that, you know, the $145 is the lowest of the prices that we had.

259
00:17:26,214 --> 00:17:39,099
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's going across the board, that means for-profit and non-profit will be paying that amount, unless they apply for that $75 if they don't need any other facility use.

260
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:39,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

261
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,179
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

262
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:44,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just concerned because- Excuse me.

263
00:17:45,585 --> 00:17:57,069
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're still required to pay for the bond and the bond interest in future years, I just want to make sure that we have the funds if we're supposed to be able to do that from this account.

264
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:11,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be very clear that we're going to raise enough money to be able to do that and not have a shortage and have to go into our general school club accounts or the city's general account to pay for it.

265
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:11,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

266
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,522
[SPEAKER_02]: That would take us to the second portion of this, which is the use of the our school software.

267
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:24,826
[SPEAKER_02]: And that should increase our rental income because we'll have better tracking and better tracking just usually means more income.

268
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:25,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

269
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:27,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

270
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:28,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I have a couple of questions.

271
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:29,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it's okay.

272
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:30,569
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

273
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:37,572
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was my first question just to make sure that one 45 is, is what other communities are paying.

274
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:39,713
[SPEAKER_03]: My second one is,

275
00:18:41,065 --> 00:18:46,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Up above, where it says, Groups Grandfathered, Method Youth Soccer, and Method Lacrosse.

276
00:18:47,631 --> 00:18:51,794
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to have on file a copy of their 5013C.

277
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:55,577
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have record that they are a non-profit?

278
00:18:55,857 --> 00:18:56,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

279
00:18:56,378 --> 00:18:56,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

280
00:18:56,878 --> 00:19:02,162
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really happy to see this, because these groups have been using our fields for a very long time.

281
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:07,867
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm wondering how delegation of field time is going to be handled.

282
00:19:08,766 --> 00:19:10,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let Mr. Maloney answer that.

283
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:10,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

284
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:24,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that when we built the Field of Dreams or Edgeley Field, it was prioritized that non-profits that took care of the youth in our community were to get first usage.

285
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:27,908
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, out to the highest bidder after that?

286
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:30,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if that's... That's not true.

287
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:30,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

288
00:19:30,788 --> 00:19:31,968
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not true.

289
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:34,329
[SPEAKER_03]: High school first, of course.

290
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:39,730
[SPEAKER_13]: The high school, all three turf fields, the high school gets the field to six, six o'clock.

291
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:46,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Generally, they do not use Hormel because transportation issues by the time the kids get down there.

292
00:19:47,091 --> 00:19:51,292
[SPEAKER_13]: So, the two edgily fields, the high school is on the six o'clock.

293
00:19:52,664 --> 00:19:58,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Method youth soccer and method youth lacrosse generally are on that field six to eight and then we go out.

294
00:19:58,067 --> 00:19:59,588
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no higher bidders or anything.

295
00:19:59,628 --> 00:20:01,890
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always been one 45 across the board.

296
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:14,697
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, the prior administration had a, uh, agreement with method youth soccer and method youth lacrosse that they would pay $75 an hour for practice and a hundred dollars on Saturday for a game.

297
00:20:15,998 --> 00:20:19,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, that's, I think it's great that it's grandfathered in, but,

298
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,272
[SPEAKER_13]: As far as that, I don't anticipate any changes there.

299
00:20:23,773 --> 00:20:40,144
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's important that the 8 to 11 group is paying the rack rate to bring in the money, and also on weekends that they're paying the rack rate, $145 an hour, because if you start giving up these three fields away to all non-profits, you're not going to make any money.

300
00:20:41,244 --> 00:20:45,828
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know Method Youth Soccer and Method Youth Lacrosse should be very happy with this agreement.

301
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:49,330
[SPEAKER_13]: They're getting a good bang for their buck up there right now.

302
00:20:50,008 --> 00:21:00,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I spoke with the president of Method Youth Soccer earlier this year, and they had stated that they requested 12 hours on the turf fields and got six this season.

303
00:21:01,397 --> 00:21:02,878
[SPEAKER_03]: A week, not total.

304
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:03,899
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not true.

305
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:04,439
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

306
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:06,881
[SPEAKER_03]: They got more than that?

307
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:12,886
[SPEAKER_13]: The original agreement, they had six to eight on Monday through Thursday nights.

308
00:21:13,326 --> 00:21:17,209
[SPEAKER_13]: This year, we gave them an additional hour on one field, six to nine.

309
00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:20,604
[SPEAKER_13]: There's 28 fields in Medford.

310
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,287
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I'm not running for politics, so I don't need anybody's vote.

311
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,389
[SPEAKER_13]: But we have 28 fields in Medford with grass.

312
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:35,294
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad that we have turf fields, but, you know, it's good for the young kids to learn how to play on the grass, because that's where you pick up some skills.

313
00:21:35,815 --> 00:21:41,399
[SPEAKER_13]: We just can't give the turf field away, because people don't want to play on grass anymore, with all due respect.

314
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:43,841
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just didn't know if they had no other availability.

315
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:46,062
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we have Harris Park.

316
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:47,363
[SPEAKER_13]: We have behind the Andrews.

317
00:21:47,423 --> 00:21:48,604
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Plaisted Park.

318
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,004
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you drive around the city, Victory Park, you drive by Victory Park on a Saturday, it's jammed with soccer.

319
00:21:55,544 --> 00:22:07,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with the new computer system, we'll be able to see who's on our fields, and maybe the city side will get it for the parks, so that way we know, and we can look, like, okay, so you need some more time.

320
00:22:07,812 --> 00:22:12,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the city has time, and here's what's available for you to use that way.

321
00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:13,975
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be helpful on both ends.

322
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that clarification.

323
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:21,480
[SPEAKER_03]: So my next question, and you might want to just hang around, Bob, sorry.

324
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:35,584
[SPEAKER_03]: So the registered Method Public Schools Booster organizations shall be allowed available times, otherwise not booked, which is great, at the gymnasium and at elderly field.

325
00:22:36,044 --> 00:22:39,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make sure that these Booster clubs are also non-profit.

326
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:45,347
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to have their non-profit status filed with our offices in order to get that.

327
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:52,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I know some are and some aren't, and this will encourage them all to become non-profit in that way there.

328
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:58,633
[SPEAKER_03]: It protects them in the school district at the same time, and that's my goal here.

329
00:22:58,973 --> 00:23:15,676
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they don't have non-profit, at least if they filed the papers and they can prove that, if they're planning on using it soon, I'd like that paperwork in City Hall and give them a deadline of like September 15th or whatever you think is fair, October 1st, you know,

330
00:23:17,127 --> 00:23:19,268
[SPEAKER_03]: But we should come up with a date for that.

331
00:23:19,868 --> 00:23:26,432
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they're not nonprofit, we're going to have to say, I'm sorry, you need to become that in order to use our field.

332
00:23:26,452 --> 00:23:29,694
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would like that added in to the wording of that.

333
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:38,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, with their filings of their papers, I would like to know who's in charge of those nonprofits, their names, and contact information.

334
00:23:39,957 --> 00:23:47,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way if there's ever an issue, say something goes haywire on the field and some damage happens, we don't have to search for that.

335
00:23:47,983 --> 00:23:49,385
[SPEAKER_03]: That's also in our database.

336
00:23:55,049 --> 00:24:00,734
[SPEAKER_03]: But sometimes there's multiple people, so like if, like on their non-profit things, like, yeah.

337
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:11,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, the superintendent had suggested that at the beginning of each school year, we actually recertify these groups.

338
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,280
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

339
00:24:13,361 --> 00:24:14,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a great idea as well.

340
00:24:17,683 --> 00:24:25,868
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Hormel decision should also ensure Edgley field rates if we're providing enough notice for current renters.

341
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:27,549
[SPEAKER_03]: So are we already?

342
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what Hormel's already charging?

343
00:24:30,191 --> 00:24:31,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you know that.

344
00:24:31,092 --> 00:24:32,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Hormel and Edgley are both $145 an hour.

345
00:24:33,818 --> 00:24:39,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, and we're not going- If Method Youth Soccer gets displaced down there or they use that field, they pay the same discounted fee.

346
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:40,562
[SPEAKER_03]: In the real cost.

347
00:24:40,582 --> 00:24:51,148
[SPEAKER_13]: But if the mayor wants to convene a meeting in the future, I would recommend the Hormel Commission be involved, and both facilities go up at the same time if we're gonna have an increase.

348
00:24:51,568 --> 00:25:02,555
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're gonna be getting quarterly reports on this, so we can look at this to see if this rate is great enough for us to- Should we just go ahead?

349
00:25:06,323 --> 00:25:17,933
[SPEAKER_03]: if this is great enough for us to pay our bond and pay the bills on the upkeep of the fields and the equipment that we're using, and see then if any changes are made.

350
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:20,715
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thank you for all your work on this.

351
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:26,040
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could add those things in, Pat, I make a motion to pass if those things are added in.

352
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:28,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

353
00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:28,522
[SPEAKER_17]: Cuneo.

354
00:25:29,803 --> 00:25:31,565
[SPEAKER_17]: No, actually everything has been asked.

355
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:41,384
[SPEAKER_09]: And just one, on the registered MPS booster organizations will be allowed available times, times not otherwise booked.

356
00:25:41,444 --> 00:25:43,285
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, booked by when?

357
00:25:44,025 --> 00:25:46,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we talking a week in advance, two weeks in advance?

358
00:25:46,406 --> 00:25:46,666
[SPEAKER_09]: How?

359
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:53,189
[SPEAKER_13]: So, like Haley Horgan for the band's very organized, so she's at Hormel twice a year.

360
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,891
[SPEAKER_13]: I usually get her dates 11 months in advance.

361
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:58,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Some coaches I may get it a day in advance.

362
00:25:59,408 --> 00:26:01,328
[SPEAKER_13]: So if it's available, we give it to them.

363
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:03,529
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's not available, they're out of luck.

364
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:05,689
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

365
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:20,232
[SPEAKER_13]: What that group's talking about is like a summer camp for soccer or a basketball camp in the gymnasium that is run by our high school coaches.

366
00:26:21,452 --> 00:26:25,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Haley runs two beautiful band camps at Hormel Stadium.

367
00:26:27,567 --> 00:26:29,628
[SPEAKER_13]: We have people in the Little Theater periodically.

368
00:26:29,648 --> 00:26:33,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Aaron Keith does a great job in the summer with a summer program in the Little Theater.

369
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:37,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Michael Skorka will generally do something in the cafeterias or something.

370
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:43,431
[SPEAKER_13]: So we try to take care of the people who work for us and they can make some money for their programs.

371
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:47,191
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not charging custodians.

372
00:26:47,211 --> 00:26:48,992
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not charging technicians.

373
00:26:49,252 --> 00:26:50,972
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not paying for field workers.

374
00:26:51,032 --> 00:26:53,173
[SPEAKER_09]: And the money is going directly to the programs?

375
00:26:53,393 --> 00:26:53,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

376
00:26:53,893 --> 00:26:54,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

377
00:26:54,593 --> 00:26:54,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

378
00:26:58,062 --> 00:27:01,485
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, a couple of things.

379
00:27:01,505 --> 00:27:21,601
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just looking at, when we have all these programs that are going on, Bob, like we have things going on in the Mosh and Can Theater and we have things going on in the cafeteria and, you know, in the gymnasium, and I understand that we're going to have the calendar and everything is, but you are the one who is in charge of all of this.

380
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,403
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's impossible for you to be at every single place.

381
00:27:24,924 --> 00:27:26,705
[SPEAKER_17]: So what's the next step after you?

382
00:27:26,765 --> 00:27:27,506
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there some, like,

383
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:36,365
[SPEAKER_17]: Is whoever rents the Karen Theater in charge of the Karen Theater, or is there someone from the high school that oversees it while you're not there?

384
00:27:37,185 --> 00:27:39,087
[SPEAKER_13]: It depends on the situation.

385
00:27:40,087 --> 00:27:44,230
[SPEAKER_13]: Generally, somebody from Rich Schrader's group's there.

386
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:49,554
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, if a custodian has to be hired, there'll be a custodian on the property.

387
00:27:49,994 --> 00:27:54,017
[SPEAKER_13]: Generally, we have a custodian on either at night or they're on Saturdays with the Japanese group.

388
00:27:56,797 --> 00:27:58,098
[SPEAKER_13]: Every rental is different.

389
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:07,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Generally, we have somebody on whether it's myself, Rachel Perry, a custodian, or Lisa Dunphy, or Michael McLaughlin from Rich Strada's group.

390
00:28:07,926 --> 00:28:08,206
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

391
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:09,687
[SPEAKER_17]: So at least there's someone.

392
00:28:09,847 --> 00:28:12,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, there's always somebody overseeing the rental.

393
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:13,390
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

394
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:22,157
[SPEAKER_17]: And actually, while we're on, I mean, it's on the rental fees, but I am going to throw this in here because you were talking about coaches and things like that and schedules.

395
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:49,567
[SPEAKER_17]: Could we make it a point that, I know it's hard sometimes, but now especially with 16 different cities and towns that parents and students will be participating in, if we could have our coaches please give out some type of schedule to parents for each and every sport because this fly-by moment is getting a little ridiculous and has nothing to do with the two of you.

396
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:56,776
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, but that and also to make sure that there's a contact number of who and where to contact a coach.

397
00:28:57,256 --> 00:28:57,416
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

398
00:28:57,956 --> 00:28:58,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's well overdue.

399
00:28:58,517 --> 00:29:00,417
[SPEAKER_02]: The our school program is really well rounded.

400
00:29:00,918 --> 00:29:05,500
[SPEAKER_02]: It has facets for parents, facets for administration, facets for coaches.

401
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:13,403
[SPEAKER_02]: They all have their own piece of this program and so there'll be a public calendar and then you'll be able to go into each team and see their activity.

402
00:29:14,024 --> 00:29:14,324
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

403
00:29:15,007 --> 00:29:18,329
[SPEAKER_17]: But even on top of that, though, I mean, we had something similar.

404
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:25,514
[SPEAKER_17]: I know it wasn't the best of the best systems, because I know Bobby got a lot of calls from us at the last minute going, it just got changed.

405
00:29:25,574 --> 00:29:30,157
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we here, or on the other side of the city, or another city completely?

406
00:29:30,677 --> 00:29:41,445
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think ownership of coaches taking their own ownership, and I know it's great to have the calendar, and it's great for parents to go into their calendar if they're at work, or if they're driving

407
00:29:42,364 --> 00:30:03,511
[SPEAKER_17]: a game, but I think it's very important that coaches, and I'm not saying that all or none do this, but while I have the opportunity, I'd like to put it out there and say that all coaches should take the responsibility of giving some type of schedule to the students and have like a night with the parents that they give a schedule to the parent and a contact number.

408
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,211
[SPEAKER_13]: Our school has that component.

409
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:08,132
[SPEAKER_13]: We're very happy to have it coming in.

410
00:30:08,832 --> 00:30:11,333
[SPEAKER_13]: The results go on there right away if you want to

411
00:30:12,115 --> 00:30:18,758
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, if you have two kids, one's participating in the band, one in soccer, you can download their schedules for the year.

412
00:30:19,998 --> 00:30:22,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Coach's contact, email, phone number, everything's in there.

413
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,380
[SPEAKER_13]: The trainer's information in there.

414
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,941
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a fantastic software we're getting.

415
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,422
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're very happy about it.

416
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:31,143
[SPEAKER_17]: That sounds great, but we still need to let the parents know that.

417
00:30:31,524 --> 00:30:36,085
[SPEAKER_17]: So if a coach isn't relaying that message, then the parents are not going to be able to get that message.

418
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:36,946
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll get it out.

419
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:41,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Directions are on there, yeah.

420
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:43,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

421
00:30:44,526 --> 00:30:58,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Today I had the opportunity to look at the summer rec program that City Hall put out and I noticed that Mary Judd has her summer swim camps on there, which is great.

422
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,190
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know there are other camps.

423
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:05,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's a soccer camp and I know that there's probably a lot of other things going on.

424
00:31:06,815 --> 00:31:13,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I would really like that to be added on an annual basis to that book, so that way everybody in the community sees everything.

425
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:23,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if it says, you know, the football camp is practicing here on three nights, it's only open to Meffitt High students.

426
00:31:23,888 --> 00:31:28,552
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, at least then, people in the city are seeing all the great things that we're doing.

427
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:34,136
[SPEAKER_03]: But, like, I know that that soccer camp, my kids went to it when they were young.

428
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:43,047
[SPEAKER_03]: all the way through it, and it's not on there, and it would be good publicity for that group to bring in those funds to help.

429
00:31:43,407 --> 00:31:50,909
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's a way before that's printed, if the... Right, I know it is for this year.

430
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:59,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm making... Right, and then parents would really have options and really can see everything going on.

431
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:02,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we have so many programs that we should be yelling it.

432
00:32:04,692 --> 00:32:08,453
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion on the floor for approval by Mr. Benedetto.

433
00:32:08,673 --> 00:32:10,354
[SPEAKER_03]: With changes to the wording.

434
00:32:13,855 --> 00:32:21,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Adding that non-profit and that the booster clubs and names of contact and offices among those groups.

435
00:32:22,018 --> 00:32:22,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of contact.

436
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:23,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

437
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:26,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Ms.

438
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:27,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Vanke.

439
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

440
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Desgheri, please call the roll.

441
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Jamila, I'm sorry.

442
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:30,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

443
00:32:30,661 --> 00:32:31,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Crutch has a question.

444
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:32,841
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of like an informational question.

445
00:32:32,882 --> 00:32:34,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to know about the new system.

446
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:58,007
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know, Pat, if the new system allows parents to like, I don't know, like create it, download an app or anything like that, or where they can create a username and password, and if they had an account, they would get a message, like a text message or an email, if it was changed, you know, and then they could check before they go to the game, like make sure I don't get an email or a text message before we head off.

447
00:32:58,387 --> 00:32:58,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

448
00:32:59,287 --> 00:33:00,648
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a lot of that functionality.

449
00:33:01,007 --> 00:33:04,009
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to add it incrementally, so it'll take us a little while to get there.

450
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:05,650
[SPEAKER_02]: But the one thing, Ms.

451
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:09,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Cuno, that it has is it has an email list roster by coach.

452
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:16,898
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when a change needs to go out, coach has already built their email list from the list of parents that they have, and they can just send an auto message.

453
00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:24,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for all this work to refine the schedule.

454
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

455
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:44,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Vanden Heuvel.

456
00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:47,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote, please.

457
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:47,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

458
00:33:48,131 --> 00:33:49,331
Benedetto.

459
00:33:49,351 --> 00:33:49,671
Yes.

460
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:50,032
Gretz.

461
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:50,252
Yes.

462
00:33:50,392 --> 00:33:50,832
Estrada.

463
00:33:50,852 --> 00:33:51,032
Yes.

464
00:33:51,232 --> 00:33:51,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

465
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:53,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

466
00:33:53,413 --> 00:33:53,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

467
00:33:57,015 --> 00:33:57,395
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry?

468
00:33:57,455 --> 00:34:00,297
[SPEAKER_05]: It's for the budget.

469
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:03,618
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the budget that comes next, that comes after this.

470
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on proposed succession plan for the superintendent.

471
00:34:10,802 --> 00:34:17,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, recently there's been some discussion about a succession plan, whether we would have one.

472
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:21,406
[SPEAKER_11]: And so in response to your request, we've put one together for you.

473
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,948
[SPEAKER_11]: It comes in the two types of scenarios.

474
00:34:25,988 --> 00:34:34,532
[SPEAKER_11]: The first scenario is that if there was an untimely or unexpected vacancy created by either illness or some other dastardly act,

475
00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:44,746
[SPEAKER_11]: and the superintendent is unable to perform his duties for whatever reason, then the deputy superintendent would become the interim superintendent.

476
00:34:44,926 --> 00:34:48,447
[SPEAKER_11]: The school committee would begin a search process for a permanent replacement.

477
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:52,708
[SPEAKER_11]: The deputy would serve until either the superintendent returned or a new leader was selected.

478
00:34:53,448 --> 00:35:00,489
[SPEAKER_11]: The current school system administration is an experienced team that can handle transition and maintain operations for an extended period of time.

479
00:35:01,149 --> 00:35:01,729
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just go over.

480
00:35:01,749 --> 00:35:06,170
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a deputy superintendent, an assistant superintendent, director of finance and administration,

481
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:12,990
[SPEAKER_11]: a director of pupil services, director of buildings and grounds, as well as principals, assistant principals, department directors in place.

482
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:15,932
[SPEAKER_11]: And each would be able to carry out their essential functions.

483
00:35:16,873 --> 00:35:30,382
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that should there be an unexpected situation occur and that things happen to people and things go on, whether it be illness or something else, I think we have a very experienced team in place that could step up and run the school district for a period of time.

484
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:36,326
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the committee reached a point where they felt that they had to do something a little bit more permanent, then the next thing would kick in.

485
00:35:37,761 --> 00:36:00,448
[SPEAKER_11]: If there was an announced vacancy, for example, the superintendent decided to retire, the committee decided not to rehire the superintendent or whatever the case may be, the Medford School Committee could retain the Massachusetts Association of School Committees as one example to conduct a search or a similar organization.

486
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:01,288
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give you a little bit.

487
00:36:01,968 --> 00:36:05,810
[SPEAKER_11]: A search by an organization costs generally somewhere between $10,000 and $12,000.

488
00:36:07,557 --> 00:36:11,058
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a typical search for MASC.

489
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,899
[SPEAKER_11]: If you went to what Lexington did, it cost them $35,000.

490
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:20,542
[SPEAKER_11]: They hired a national firm, and they found three people from Massachusetts after they did their national search.

491
00:36:22,623 --> 00:36:26,104
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, you know, obviously MASC can, you know, can do a very good job.

492
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:29,365
[SPEAKER_11]: They do a lot of them around the country, and we can give you examples of it.

493
00:36:29,385 --> 00:36:30,986
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's probably a preferred option.

494
00:36:31,026 --> 00:36:36,628
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the least expensive for an experienced organization that does it around the state and has many, many contacts.

495
00:36:39,201 --> 00:36:42,024
[SPEAKER_11]: A comprehensive search process normally takes four to five months.

496
00:36:43,305 --> 00:36:44,886
[SPEAKER_11]: It isn't a full year process.

497
00:36:44,926 --> 00:36:47,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, naturally, if you're not happy with the candidates, it could take a little bit longer.

498
00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:53,413
[SPEAKER_11]: But generally, if things go according to normal plan, it's four to five months to complete.

499
00:36:54,234 --> 00:36:57,616
[SPEAKER_11]: The time frame may vary depending on geographical location of your search.

500
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:03,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, if you want to bring people in from California or Montana or Hawaii, it may take a little longer to interview them.

501
00:37:03,997 --> 00:37:13,625
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're interested in bringing people from Massachusetts, New England area, or things like that, New York, Connecticut, you certainly could do this in that time frame.

502
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:18,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, a number of community focus groups that you would want to hold.

503
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people want to hold focus groups in different sections of the city.

504
00:37:22,632 --> 00:37:23,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people want to do it by school.

505
00:37:24,374 --> 00:37:27,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people want to do it by topic, special ed, ELL.

506
00:37:28,057 --> 00:37:31,620
[SPEAKER_11]: You can decide whatever approach you'd want to use.

507
00:37:32,173 --> 00:37:35,675
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can give you guidelines on how to do that if you chose to do that.

508
00:37:36,435 --> 00:37:39,517
[SPEAKER_11]: The typical search process, five phases, and they're as follows.

509
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:41,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Phase one is a leadership profile development.

510
00:37:42,018 --> 00:37:42,679
[SPEAKER_11]: It takes about a month.

511
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,781
[SPEAKER_11]: You would sit and talk about, you know, what you expected in a leader.

512
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:58,066
[SPEAKER_11]: And you would create, for the organization running the search for you, the kinds of information they would need to put up brochures and do advertisements and be part of the screening process, which would be,

513
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:00,357
[SPEAKER_11]: coming on a little bit later.

514
00:38:00,397 --> 00:38:02,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Phase two would be candidate recruitment.

515
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:09,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Once that's decided, brochures would go out, advertisements would go out, and candidates would be recruited.

516
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:14,347
[SPEAKER_11]: And then phase three would be candidate screening, also about a month's worth of time.

517
00:38:15,548 --> 00:38:21,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Then phase four, community evaluation of candidate finalists, because they would be narrowed down to three, four, five people.

518
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,235
[SPEAKER_11]: And you could do that generally in less than a month.

519
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:28,538
[SPEAKER_11]: You may want to take a little longer, but three weeks is generally a normal search.

520
00:38:29,158 --> 00:38:32,161
[SPEAKER_11]: And then phase five, the appointment and contract negotiation.

521
00:38:32,181 --> 00:38:43,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Give yourself a little bit of time to meet the person that you might want to hire, and then spend some time talking to that person about terms and conditions of their contract and what your expectations are.

522
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:55,100
[SPEAKER_11]: And from time to time, an individual and a candidate decides at the last minute they don't want to be there, or the terms and conditions, so you might have to go back to candidate two, three, four, whatever you choose to do.

523
00:38:57,495 --> 00:39:02,457
[SPEAKER_11]: I've given you the MASC detailed guidelines for each phase and the kinds of things they would ask.

524
00:39:02,497 --> 00:39:06,239
[SPEAKER_11]: I can give you more, but I felt tonight this was a good enough start to get going.

525
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:11,581
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, the recent Brookline search took four, it took four months and I attached that for you.

526
00:39:11,621 --> 00:39:14,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Brookline, uh, much more expansive than some places.

527
00:39:15,502 --> 00:39:19,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, the selection of an interim superintendent from Malden is scheduled for three months and change.

528
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:21,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, they're currently doing it.

529
00:39:21,645 --> 00:39:24,766
[SPEAKER_11]: They started in May and they hope to have somebody aboard by July one.

530
00:39:25,487 --> 00:39:29,450
[SPEAKER_11]: The fall river selection took a little better than three months, and that's a bigger community.

531
00:39:29,991 --> 00:39:35,055
[SPEAKER_11]: But I can give you other examples of, you know, search times, but I wanted to give you a few that you could look at.

532
00:39:35,976 --> 00:39:40,560
[SPEAKER_11]: I've attached some information, some brochure-like information, and some other things that people have put out.

533
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we can do more if you felt that was necessary.

534
00:39:46,164 --> 00:39:48,786
[SPEAKER_11]: The process for community involvement can take many forms.

535
00:39:49,547 --> 00:39:51,328
[SPEAKER_11]: You can have a community survey online.

536
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:53,110
[SPEAKER_11]: You can have a hard copy survey.

537
00:39:53,736 --> 00:40:08,141
[SPEAKER_11]: You can have community forums like we've had in the past, or you can have categorical focus groups where you bring in, you know, different groups from a school or grade level, areas of interest, talk to the faculty, staff members.

538
00:40:08,502 --> 00:40:10,882
[SPEAKER_11]: You can mix and match these as you see fit.

539
00:40:12,323 --> 00:40:23,227
[SPEAKER_11]: And as you review this at some point in time, you may want to give me guidance so that we can refine it and develop it into the next stage of readiness for you to go forward.

540
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:32,224
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you want to determine who's going to be on the screening teams internally, whether you're going to have the full committee and other people, or you're just going to use the full committee.

541
00:40:33,925 --> 00:40:35,086
[SPEAKER_11]: So those are some of the things.

542
00:40:35,126 --> 00:40:36,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Or you can combine any of the above.

543
00:40:37,908 --> 00:40:42,472
[SPEAKER_11]: A formal application form, I attached an example of that for your review.

544
00:40:42,492 --> 00:40:43,393
[SPEAKER_11]: You can change it.

545
00:40:43,433 --> 00:40:44,674
[SPEAKER_11]: You can ask different questions.

546
00:40:45,515 --> 00:40:49,478
[SPEAKER_11]: That's up to you, but I think that's typical of what you would ask and what you would look for.

547
00:40:52,090 --> 00:41:01,754
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, of course, the selection of a group such as MASC can greatly facilitate what goes on to enhance the possibilities of finding a good fit for Medford.

548
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:07,236
[SPEAKER_11]: And lastly, there'd be a transition process between the outgoing leadership and the incoming superintendent.

549
00:41:07,796 --> 00:41:21,242
[SPEAKER_11]: And every effort would be made by my administration to assist in that process to ensure that the individual had the benefit of knowing where things were and what our perspectives were based on our own experience.

550
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:29,515
[SPEAKER_11]: So the above report and attached information help allay any concerns that a succession plan is in place and a process can happen in a reasonable timeframe.

551
00:41:30,175 --> 00:41:31,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy to take any questions you might have.

552
00:41:31,677 --> 00:41:31,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

553
00:41:31,797 --> 00:41:32,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Suno.

554
00:41:33,398 --> 00:41:33,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

555
00:41:33,818 --> 00:41:35,059
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

556
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,861
[SPEAKER_17]: I was actually pleased that I saw this report.

557
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:42,985
[SPEAKER_17]: I had actually called up MASC and asked the executive director there for the report.

558
00:41:43,406 --> 00:41:46,788
[SPEAKER_17]: And he had just told me that he had just hung up with the superintendent.

559
00:41:46,828 --> 00:41:48,089
[SPEAKER_17]: So our timing was really good.

560
00:41:49,950 --> 00:42:12,679
[SPEAKER_17]: Just a little bit of my insight on this is when and if this time does come, because it will come, that whether it's MASC or any other type of organization that will facilitate this, it's very important that we do get someone from the outside.

561
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,621
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that there have been cities and towns that have decided to take it upon themselves to do the search.

562
00:42:18,915 --> 00:42:27,057
[SPEAKER_17]: Honestly, they don't save money, and you really need to have the expertise to really guide you in the right direction.

563
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:34,779
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, ultimately, it is our decision to be made, but I really strongly suggest the decision does not have to be made now.

564
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:36,360
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no motions to be made.

565
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:45,622
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just saying that when the subsection plan does come into place, it is very important that we go and we get someone that has the expertise in this type of field.

566
00:42:48,544 --> 00:42:53,829
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to thank the superintendent for putting the report together.

567
00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:59,614
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it gives us a, it's good to have this outline for us and in our records.

568
00:43:00,374 --> 00:43:03,977
[SPEAKER_09]: I make a motion to accept the paper and place it on file.

569
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

570
00:43:12,061 --> 00:43:15,062
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I just want to say thank you for putting this together.

571
00:43:15,102 --> 00:43:16,023
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very well done.

572
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:18,724
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good basic base.

573
00:43:19,444 --> 00:43:27,108
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, you know, it's not specific to what we want to do as a school committee, but it at least has something in place if something were to happen.

574
00:43:27,508 --> 00:43:30,469
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's what the community came forward asking for.

575
00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:32,770
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that we fulfilled that with this document.

576
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,671
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to say thank you for that.

577
00:43:35,051 --> 00:43:36,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's some more work to do.

578
00:43:36,552 --> 00:43:39,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe at the beginning of next year, we should sit down and really

579
00:43:40,178 --> 00:43:47,684
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in case things were to arise, have more specific what we as a committee see what our steps would be.

580
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:51,208
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't even have to think about it in case of any emergency.

581
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:55,271
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to thank you for putting this together so well.

582
00:43:55,671 --> 00:44:06,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondly is, I also, for just information, when I was at a class at MASC with my colleagues, we did, down the hall, was a class on how to pick a superintendent.

583
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:16,516
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe it's a good idea if some of us were to take that class, so that way in the future we have some knowledge moving forward.

584
00:44:16,536 --> 00:44:27,383
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be all of us, but it might be a great idea for us to have for future knowledge in case an emergency or a different situation were to arise.

585
00:44:27,824 --> 00:44:35,889
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to see when they're offering that, and if any members or any of my colleagues would like to join me in taking that class.

586
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:39,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information.

587
00:44:39,213 --> 00:44:50,597
[SPEAKER_17]: In speaking to the executive director, that is something that we were going to try to do something this year, but it was just that the schedule had been really busy for them and they couldn't do it.

588
00:44:50,677 --> 00:45:02,380
[SPEAKER_17]: So instead of everyone trying to fit in a class, we're going to try to see when his schedule is free, and then I'd bring you the dates for them to come to us.

589
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:07,922
[SPEAKER_17]: And we could do it like a meeting of the whole, and we could have any questions that we have that evening.

590
00:45:08,393 --> 00:45:17,737
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you want to specialize it in the superintendent search or trying to learn more about a superintendent search, that's what we were trying to figure out.

591
00:45:18,177 --> 00:45:19,998
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was the point of information on that.

592
00:45:20,698 --> 00:45:22,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, we could do it here.

593
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:29,102
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we've done it in the past where they come and they go over certain things, but I think this would be an opportunity for them to come.

594
00:45:29,862 --> 00:45:31,463
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I can make a suggestion.

595
00:45:32,405 --> 00:45:45,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, just simply this is that you've got some outlines here, so go down it and see whether you, what kind of, what kind of combinations you like, and then we'll call a committee of the whole or some point and you can decide, you know, if this happens, we want this type of focus group.

596
00:45:46,454 --> 00:45:47,794
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd like a survey online.

597
00:45:48,115 --> 00:45:49,395
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd like this, we'd like that.

598
00:45:49,856 --> 00:45:50,796
[SPEAKER_11]: So you put it together.

599
00:45:50,816 --> 00:45:55,799
[SPEAKER_11]: So you flesh out the document based on what you would like to see and we'll give you guidance on that.

600
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:01,543
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not a difficult thing to do, but remember this was the outline so that you can get started and then you can,

601
00:46:02,373 --> 00:46:04,174
[SPEAKER_11]: flesh it out a little bit and say what I want.

602
00:46:04,674 --> 00:46:05,715
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, what do you want?

603
00:46:06,235 --> 00:46:08,716
[SPEAKER_11]: And it will be different in different communities.

604
00:46:08,736 --> 00:46:12,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Some communities will emphasize one thing, and some communities will want to emphasize something else.

605
00:46:12,818 --> 00:46:14,459
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can get started.

606
00:46:14,499 --> 00:46:19,261
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure Glenn Kocher or Jim Harney or some of the other people that work for MASC would be happy to come out.

607
00:46:20,022 --> 00:46:22,123
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're your best bargain, to be honest with you.

608
00:46:22,143 --> 00:46:29,186
[SPEAKER_11]: They do enough of them around the Commonwealth, so they've got lots of experience and lots of contacts and get along with MASS pretty well.

609
00:46:29,933 --> 00:46:36,315
[SPEAKER_11]: And you don't have to pay the fees for some national firm that, you know, we'll find somebody, uh, two communities over, you know.

610
00:46:37,675 --> 00:46:38,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

611
00:46:38,275 --> 00:46:42,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I think that's, that's a really good idea, Mr. Bellson.

612
00:46:42,796 --> 00:46:58,720
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I would like to do since I'm the chair of the personnel subcommittee, I'd like to put it on the schedule for, um, late September and, um, call a meeting, a subcommittee meeting to go over this and to, to put,

613
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:02,581
[SPEAKER_03]: those ideas together and so that way it doesn't get lost.

614
00:47:03,302 --> 00:47:08,366
[SPEAKER_05]: So I make a motion to have that.

615
00:47:10,768 --> 00:47:12,629
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do it over the summer.

616
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:16,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we can do it this summer either if people are around.

617
00:47:30,852 --> 00:47:30,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

618
00:47:31,032 --> 00:47:32,013
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

619
00:47:32,374 --> 00:47:33,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Papers sent and submitted.

620
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:35,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Will someone make a motion for substantial rules?

621
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:36,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

622
00:47:36,237 --> 00:47:36,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Cuno?

623
00:47:37,138 --> 00:47:45,745
[SPEAKER_05]: So that we can recognize the Medford Kiwanis for the annual book donation we have with us City Councilor Rick Garviello representing the Kiwanis.

624
00:47:46,406 --> 00:47:53,212
[SPEAKER_05]: The Medford Public Schools would once again like to thank the Kiwanis Club of Medford for their generous donation of books to our first and third grade students.

625
00:47:53,732 --> 00:47:56,495
[SPEAKER_05]: The Kiwanis Club has always gone above and beyond for the benefit of Medford.

626
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:02,623
[SPEAKER_05]: In the spring of each year, I look forward to the phone call from Kiwanis Club asking for the numbers of children in Grades 1 and 3.

627
00:48:02,743 --> 00:48:07,526
[SPEAKER_05]: For the past few years, President Ricarbello called in May and said, it's that time of year again.

628
00:48:07,546 --> 00:48:10,087
[SPEAKER_05]: The students are overjoyed when they receive their books.

629
00:48:10,508 --> 00:48:12,709
[SPEAKER_05]: They quickly open up their bags and begin to read.

630
00:48:12,729 --> 00:48:14,470
[SPEAKER_05]: This is such a great way to kick off the summer.

631
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:19,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Many members of the Kiwanis come to all our schools to help distribute the books.

632
00:48:19,172 --> 00:48:23,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Chuck Veneziano tells the students the story of the Kiwanis Club in Dr. Seuss language.

633
00:48:23,954 --> 00:48:27,716
[SPEAKER_05]: The children love the rhymes students sometimes read and then trade the books with other students.

634
00:48:27,856 --> 00:48:32,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, on behalf of the public schools and Mr. Superintendent and Ms.

635
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:37,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Caldwell, thank you so much for making the children's summer a happy and productive time.

636
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:38,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Carvalho.

637
00:48:38,341 --> 00:48:39,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

638
00:48:39,102 --> 00:48:40,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, school committee members.

639
00:48:40,923 --> 00:48:42,703
[SPEAKER_10]: I think tonight's my 13th year.

640
00:48:44,367 --> 00:48:47,709
[SPEAKER_10]: being the Chairman of the Literacy Program for the Medford Kiwanis.

641
00:48:48,329 --> 00:48:55,273
[SPEAKER_10]: And I realize tonight we've given out 35,000 books to the children of Medford.

642
00:48:57,354 --> 00:49:03,397
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something I'm very proud of and our club is very proud of.

643
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:05,478
[SPEAKER_10]: And this year we did something a little bit different.

644
00:49:06,999 --> 00:49:10,840
[SPEAKER_10]: We gave the kids book bags this year.

645
00:49:12,021 --> 00:49:13,662
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you see the pictures in the paper,

646
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,280
[SPEAKER_10]: see the kids, they have more with your face.

647
00:49:15,981 --> 00:49:20,442
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd like to present the book bag to all the school committee members and yourself, ma'am.

648
00:49:23,143 --> 00:49:25,564
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, and again, I thank you and Ms.

649
00:49:25,584 --> 00:49:28,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Cardwell for designing this program some years ago.

650
00:49:28,745 --> 00:49:30,625
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, we'll see you next year.

651
00:49:30,986 --> 00:49:35,227
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've also incorporated the Mifflin library the last couple of years with Sam Stenick,

652
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:38,420
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they've gotten their message out for the summer reading also.

653
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:39,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

654
00:49:39,701 --> 00:49:41,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

655
00:49:42,302 --> 00:49:46,784
[SPEAKER_05]: On a motion to receive and place on file the recognition of the mythic wand, is all those in favor?

656
00:49:47,165 --> 00:49:47,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

657
00:49:47,545 --> 00:49:48,185
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

658
00:49:48,205 --> 00:49:49,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion is granted.

659
00:49:51,467 --> 00:49:54,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, this is summer schedule.

660
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:01,712
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a recommendation to approve summer rules by the superintendent.

661
00:50:04,412 --> 00:50:05,912
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a standard procedure.

662
00:50:18,576 --> 00:50:27,839
[SPEAKER_11]: So as we do this virtually every year, because we don't meet as frequently if we meet at all during the summer, I send out all kinds of information to you at different points in the summer.

663
00:50:28,279 --> 00:50:28,959
[SPEAKER_11]: But from June 21st, 2016,

664
00:50:31,051 --> 00:50:39,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Through our first meeting in September of 2016, I'm requesting the school committee grant authority to the superintendent and the school committee secretary for the following.

665
00:50:39,254 --> 00:50:48,098
[SPEAKER_11]: One, that the authority shall be granted to the secretary of the school committee to approve bills and payrolls through July and August, and that the school committee be kept informed of the bills and payrolls approved.

666
00:50:48,878 --> 00:50:55,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Two, that the administration be given permission to open bids in order to proceed on repair and maintenance work and other essential procurements.

667
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Notice to the school committee will be provided.

668
00:50:58,125 --> 00:51:03,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Three, that the superintendent be authorized to conduct the normal and necessary business of the school district throughout the summer.

669
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:13,338
[SPEAKER_11]: And four, that the superintendent keep the school committee apprised of any special situations or circumstances during the summer months or that are projected to occur at the opening of schools in September.

670
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:22,886
[SPEAKER_09]: So in the past, it's been customary that the superintendent has sent us out a report on or about

671
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:25,014
[SPEAKER_09]: August 1st to 7th.

672
00:51:25,595 --> 00:51:28,017
[SPEAKER_09]: And that actually is not specified in this list.

673
00:51:29,078 --> 00:51:36,484
[SPEAKER_09]: So while it says that you will give us updates, I'd like to formalize it and say that there will be a midsummer report will be sent out to the committee by the superintendent.

674
00:51:37,685 --> 00:51:40,747
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

675
00:51:40,928 --> 00:51:52,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I know over the years since I've been elected, we haven't had summer meetings, but if if we don't have another meeting from now, our next meeting isn't planned for late

676
00:51:52,884 --> 00:51:55,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Like September 20-something, am I correct?

677
00:51:55,566 --> 00:51:59,570
[SPEAKER_11]: We were going to schedule one earlier because with the opening of school, we had talked about that once before.

678
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:02,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, but that's almost a three-month span.

679
00:52:03,073 --> 00:52:05,235
[SPEAKER_03]: July, August, two months.

680
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:08,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's two.

681
00:52:08,818 --> 00:52:13,102
[SPEAKER_05]: If one is necessary, we will certainly reach out and call if there's something that needs to be addressed.

682
00:52:13,613 --> 00:52:17,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I always felt like that we should meet before the opening of schools.

683
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,437
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just my opinion.

684
00:52:19,477 --> 00:52:20,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always felt that.

685
00:52:21,319 --> 00:52:23,180
[SPEAKER_03]: School opens without us meeting.

686
00:52:25,302 --> 00:52:27,063
[SPEAKER_03]: It just never made me feel comfortable.

687
00:52:27,163 --> 00:52:31,606
[SPEAKER_03]: And all business is just done without an email to us.

688
00:52:32,347 --> 00:52:34,108
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just have some concerns with that.

689
00:52:34,188 --> 00:52:39,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I really think that the opening of schools, I mean, we should meet before, make sure things are on track.

690
00:52:40,581 --> 00:52:43,643
[SPEAKER_03]: plan for September, make sure the coaches' meetings and the children.

691
00:52:43,663 --> 00:52:48,667
[SPEAKER_03]: And if parents have questions or concerns over the summer, they can come to us.

692
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:51,428
[SPEAKER_03]: We can discuss it before school's open.

693
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:54,370
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of things like school placements.

694
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:55,631
[SPEAKER_03]: There could be questions.

695
00:52:55,651 --> 00:52:58,213
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of things that could arise over the summer.

696
00:52:58,613 --> 00:53:00,794
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just think it's a long span without meeting.

697
00:53:03,496 --> 00:53:06,398
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we obviously can stay in touch.

698
00:53:06,438 --> 00:53:09,740
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you see something and you want to call a meeting, you just need three members to call the meeting.

699
00:53:11,232 --> 00:53:16,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, three would three would allow for a meeting.

700
00:53:16,716 --> 00:53:18,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

701
00:53:19,337 --> 00:53:25,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it possible if people are available, can we just put it in our calendars for August 1st to have it?

702
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:27,142
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I wouldn't schedule a date yet.

703
00:53:27,282 --> 00:53:28,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody's going to make summer plans.

704
00:53:29,504 --> 00:53:35,748
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, why don't we, if you agree that you want a summer meeting, we can agree to that and we'll get back to you and check everyone's vacation plans.

705
00:53:35,808 --> 00:53:39,170
[SPEAKER_11]: But from past experience, you set a date and everyone is,

706
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:41,217
[SPEAKER_11]: in different places.

707
00:53:41,298 --> 00:53:42,118
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

708
00:53:42,138 --> 00:53:44,899
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you want a summer meeting, that's fine.

709
00:53:44,939 --> 00:53:51,342
[SPEAKER_11]: But let me caucus everyone around and find out when people are available, and then we can get a date that we know people are going to be here.

710
00:53:51,843 --> 00:53:53,684
[SPEAKER_08]: So can I make a motion to have a summer meeting?

711
00:53:53,804 --> 00:53:55,565
[SPEAKER_08]: I do think it's important, because I do think.

712
00:53:55,585 --> 00:54:04,449
[SPEAKER_05]: So motion on the floor for a summer meeting, seconded by Mr. Stone, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

713
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:05,609
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

714
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:08,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you want to talk on it?

715
00:54:09,102 --> 00:54:15,184
[SPEAKER_09]: My feeling about it is I've always found that sort of mid-August report really valuable.

716
00:54:15,984 --> 00:54:20,926
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not really looking for a meeting to happen August 1st.

717
00:54:21,186 --> 00:54:32,589
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be more inclined to have a meeting the third week of August or, you know, the next week before, you know, either right prior to school or now.

718
00:54:32,629 --> 00:54:35,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, we start school before vacation, but I think we're saying

719
00:54:36,128 --> 00:54:39,711
[SPEAKER_09]: before Labor Day, but not necessarily midsummer.

720
00:54:39,771 --> 00:54:43,674
[SPEAKER_09]: August 1st is, you know, I think it should be a little bit later than that, personally.

721
00:55:01,516 --> 00:55:23,671
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to say that I mean I understand about the meeting and I have no problem having a meeting but to make it clear to people that even though we're not meeting just like the rest of the year is that if there's any concerns any questions any emails any phone calls or any type of anything that I know personally I get I go directly to the sources of where it's coming from and I make sure that I contact

722
00:55:24,308 --> 00:55:27,530
[SPEAKER_17]: the superintendent to make sure if there is an issue that is being addressed.

723
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:37,094
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't want people thinking that just because even during the school year, if there happens to be a holiday in between our meetings and we don't meet, that everybody's not working.

724
00:55:37,435 --> 00:55:39,676
[SPEAKER_17]: Because there's a lot of things that we do do.

725
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,057
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, it's open.

726
00:55:42,157 --> 00:55:43,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we need to let everybody know.

727
00:55:44,098 --> 00:55:50,241
[SPEAKER_17]: But I just don't want people to think that if there's a concern out there, we're not going to address it until the next time we're in front of the camera.

728
00:55:50,261 --> 00:55:52,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

729
00:55:53,232 --> 00:56:00,138
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a motion on the floor for approval of the rules as amended by Mr. Benedetto to get a report by August 1st.

730
00:56:01,038 --> 00:56:01,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote.

731
00:56:01,939 --> 00:56:03,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Can somebody direct my microphone?

732
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,101
[SPEAKER_05]: First week of August.

733
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:06,203
[SPEAKER_05]: First week of August for the report.

734
00:56:07,824 --> 00:56:08,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

735
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:10,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

736
00:56:10,306 --> 00:56:10,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

737
00:56:12,968 --> 00:56:13,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Meeting.

738
00:56:13,429 --> 00:56:13,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Rules.

739
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:14,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Rules.

740
00:56:14,129 --> 00:56:14,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Rules.

741
00:56:14,449 --> 00:56:16,371
[SPEAKER_05]: That we accepted.

742
00:56:16,411 --> 00:56:18,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Give authority to the superintendent.

743
00:56:18,193 --> 00:56:19,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Scarry.

744
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:21,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

745
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:24,948
Yes.

746
00:56:25,408 --> 00:56:25,728
Yes.

747
00:56:26,448 --> 00:56:41,072
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we have a school committee resolution be resolved with members of the school committee expressing sincere condolences to the victims' families of the tragic Orlando Terror Impact.

748
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:47,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, be it resolved that the Veterans School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Robert Sorabian.

749
00:56:47,675 --> 00:56:52,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Sorabian was a prominent local businessman whose family operated a private coffee parlor.

750
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:57,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Sorabian was also President of Everett Boppert Bank and a strong supporter of public education.

751
00:56:58,065 --> 00:57:02,147
[SPEAKER_05]: And in regards to the Orlando tragedy, we have held a vigil last Wednesday evening.

752
00:57:02,167 --> 00:57:03,688
[SPEAKER_05]: It was quite moving.

753
00:57:04,028 --> 00:57:06,169
[SPEAKER_05]: The interfaith community was involved in it.

754
00:57:06,749 --> 00:57:11,272
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was really quite heavy on the hearts of those that attended.

755
00:57:11,612 --> 00:57:13,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you all rise for a moment of silence, please?

756
00:57:13,733 --> 00:57:24,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

757
00:57:24,198 --> 00:57:26,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam Mayor, just a couple of comments, if I may.

758
00:57:29,553 --> 00:57:36,117
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if people fully realize this, but a statistic rolled by my desk this past weekend.

759
00:57:36,978 --> 00:57:39,019
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's kind of interesting.

760
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:42,001
[SPEAKER_11]: About 49, 50 people were killed in the Orlando shooting.

761
00:57:42,621 --> 00:57:49,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Since that time, there have been 207 homicides by gun violence in this country since that time.

762
00:57:51,447 --> 00:57:52,968
[SPEAKER_11]: But they're isolated situations.

763
00:57:53,608 --> 00:57:57,511
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's situations in which, you know, they're not getting the same coverage.

764
00:57:58,734 --> 00:58:04,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Orlando is truly tragic, but so isn't the ongoing gun violence that exists in our country.

765
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:14,747
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of it is based on mental health issues that people have, or just domestic disturbances, or drug deals, or other things like that that go on in society.

766
00:58:14,787 --> 00:58:16,788
[SPEAKER_11]: But it often goes unnoticed.

767
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:27,157
[SPEAKER_11]: On an average day, based on the number of gun homicides in this country, 27 people die every day, on average, by guns.

768
00:58:28,829 --> 00:58:29,770
[SPEAKER_11]: 27 people.

769
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:31,731
[SPEAKER_11]: It's horrific.

770
00:58:32,751 --> 00:58:43,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Until we start dealing with mental health, until we start dealing with the availability of guns and things like that to individuals, we are not going to abate the situation.

771
00:58:43,638 --> 00:58:46,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Terrorism is an issue and certainly to be dealt with.

772
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:57,586
[SPEAKER_11]: But there are other domestic and, let's say, personal issues that are every bit as tragic every day in our various communities.

773
00:58:59,499 --> 00:59:04,462
[SPEAKER_11]: The other comment is most people who've been around for a long time knew Bob Sarabian.

774
00:59:05,743 --> 00:59:07,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Bob was just a terrific guy.

775
00:59:08,084 --> 00:59:09,746
[SPEAKER_11]: I grew up on Governor's Ave in Medford.

776
00:59:09,966 --> 00:59:15,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Bob lived on Hutchins Road, and the Sarabian brothers operated Carpathic Area for many, many years.

777
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:17,331
[SPEAKER_11]: George was the oldest.

778
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:21,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Bob was the second oldest, and Ron is still alive and still an active businessman.

779
00:59:23,155 --> 00:59:24,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Bob was a very giving man.

780
00:59:24,876 --> 00:59:26,537
[SPEAKER_11]: He worked very closely with John Hand.

781
00:59:26,557 --> 00:59:27,938
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you remember the name John Hand.

782
00:59:28,604 --> 00:59:31,705
[SPEAKER_11]: John Hand was the executive vice president of the Medford Cooperative Bank.

783
00:59:32,246 --> 00:59:35,948
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were in arts festivals and all kinds of things that benefited the community.

784
00:59:36,648 --> 00:59:50,395
[SPEAKER_11]: So Bob was a real contributor and someone that, you know, sometimes when a person hasn't been in the public light for a long time, new people in the community don't remember that individual because they weren't around when they were very active.

785
00:59:51,055 --> 00:59:57,498
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thought it was important to at least tell you that Bob Sarabian was quite a player in this community and the Sarabian family as well.

786
01:00:01,357 --> 01:00:02,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

787
01:00:02,657 --> 01:00:06,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, while we're in suspension, if we could jump back to item five, appointment of the principal for Brooks Elementary School.

788
01:00:06,399 --> 01:00:08,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Superintendent.

789
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:27,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, pursuant to my consultations with the Brooks faculty and staff and the leadership of the Brooks parent groups, as well as my consultation with you last meeting, I'm very pleased and privileged to announce that Suzanne Galussi, who is with us this evening, is the new principal of the Brooks Elementary School.

790
01:00:32,269 --> 01:00:39,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Suzanne got her bachelor's degree from Framingham State, and then her master's in education from Wesley University.

791
01:00:39,794 --> 01:00:49,740
[SPEAKER_11]: She has 14 excellent years of teaching experience in the elementary schools in Medford, and four very successful years as assistant principal of the Brooks School, and her appointment will be effective July 1, 2016.

792
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:54,683
[SPEAKER_11]: During the upcoming administrative week, we'll meet with Ms.

793
01:00:54,703 --> 01:01:00,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Galussi and other members of the administration to determine how we will select

794
01:01:00,826 --> 01:01:05,790
[SPEAKER_11]: her assistant principal so that Brooks has that in place for the opening of school.

795
01:01:06,671 --> 01:01:07,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Suzanne, the show's yours.

796
01:01:08,292 --> 01:01:08,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

797
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:09,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

798
01:01:10,354 --> 01:01:15,398
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to take a minute to thank Mr. Belson, Madam Mayor, Ms.

799
01:01:15,418 --> 01:01:16,059
[SPEAKER_14]: Caldwell, Ms.

800
01:01:16,099 --> 01:01:21,944
[SPEAKER_14]: Nelson, and the members of the school committee for this wonderful opportunity to be the principal of the Brooks School.

801
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,867
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a very special night for me as a

802
01:01:27,912 --> 01:01:29,772
[SPEAKER_14]: the student of the Brooks School myself.

803
01:01:31,313 --> 01:01:33,994
[SPEAKER_14]: When I look back at my elementary years, I have very fond memories.

804
01:01:34,974 --> 01:01:42,876
[SPEAKER_14]: And as Mr. Bellson stated, almost 20 years as an educator in the Medford public school system, I'm truly honored.

805
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:45,076
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess you could say I've come full circle.

806
01:01:47,177 --> 01:01:52,838
[SPEAKER_14]: These past four years at the Brooks, I've really learned firsthand what a wonderful community it is at that school.

807
01:01:53,678 --> 01:01:56,639
[SPEAKER_14]: Parents, families, and staff.

808
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:05,237
[SPEAKER_14]: really come together and they embody the word community and they work together to collaborate and to educate, to support, to encourage.

809
01:02:06,017 --> 01:02:12,503
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm looking forward to what lies ahead and I'm truly honored and thank you very much.

810
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:22,331
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to say thank you to Ms.

811
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:22,811
[SPEAKER_17]: Galluzzi.

812
01:02:24,268 --> 01:02:27,749
[SPEAKER_17]: In a way, I've kind of gotten to see you evolve, if that sounds strange.

813
01:02:27,769 --> 01:02:37,573
[SPEAKER_17]: I've gotten to see her as a school teacher at the McGlynn when we first met, actually, with my middle one.

814
01:02:38,714 --> 01:02:41,475
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is what I like.

815
01:02:41,635 --> 01:02:46,517
[SPEAKER_17]: I like the idea of giving our people the opportunity to grow.

816
01:02:47,117 --> 01:02:48,818
[SPEAKER_17]: And you have shown that you could grow.

817
01:02:49,467 --> 01:03:00,553
[SPEAKER_17]: You've had the opportunity in the last four years to be the assistant principal, and that in each and every day is, you know, it is a training, but, you know, the next step forward is what brought you here.

818
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:04,630
[SPEAKER_17]: And being successful in that training is what brought you here.

819
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:17,998
[SPEAKER_17]: So when I came onto the school committee 11 years ago, and I know that we were looking for people, I remember a school committee member would always say to me, well, we need to make sure that they come from Medford first.

820
01:03:18,178 --> 01:03:21,100
[SPEAKER_17]: And I didn't understand it.

821
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:27,304
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't understand why that person would always say that, because I am a person who wants to give everybody the opportunity.

822
01:03:27,784 --> 01:03:29,705
[SPEAKER_17]: I still want to give everybody the opportunity.

823
01:03:30,052 --> 01:03:34,375
[SPEAKER_17]: But I also want to make sure that we're taking care of our faculty here.

824
01:03:34,955 --> 01:03:44,140
[SPEAKER_17]: That if we have young teachers that are willing to give their time, and they are giving their time, that we want to, on the other hand, give everyone the opportunity to grow.

825
01:03:44,981 --> 01:03:51,505
[SPEAKER_17]: With that being said, again, I'm not saying that we shouldn't hire anyone from outside, but it is really nice to see that culture

826
01:03:52,718 --> 01:04:03,707
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, progress, students get to see you, people get to see you, family gets to see you, and it's not a culture shock knowing that they're going to get a new principal.

827
01:04:04,308 --> 01:04:06,649
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just wanted to say congratulations to you for that.

828
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:07,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

829
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:17,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say that I think one of the things that was very clear was that there was such an agreement when your name was brought forward.

830
01:04:18,469 --> 01:04:22,512
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, amongst the parents, amongst the faculty, and amongst the school committee members.

831
01:04:23,513 --> 01:04:35,662
[SPEAKER_09]: We had, as school committee members, had the opportunity, well, in some ways to watch you grow personally, but also to have you present to us on any number of times and to see you actually working.

832
01:04:35,982 --> 01:04:37,623
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you would, it was a classic no-brainer.

833
01:04:38,064 --> 01:04:38,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.

834
01:04:39,365 --> 01:04:40,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

835
01:04:40,346 --> 01:04:41,266
[SPEAKER_14]: I really appreciate it.

836
01:04:41,286 --> 01:04:42,807
[SPEAKER_05]: We wish you the best.

837
01:04:42,988 --> 01:04:43,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

838
01:04:43,968 --> 01:04:44,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

839
01:04:45,922 --> 01:04:47,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion on the floor to?

840
01:04:47,823 --> 01:04:49,124
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

841
01:04:49,725 --> 01:04:50,405
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

842
01:04:50,646 --> 01:04:52,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion is granted.

843
01:04:52,327 --> 01:05:00,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Public hearing, school year 2016-2017, which is the fiscal year 2017 school budget.

844
01:05:07,755 --> 01:05:16,477
[SPEAKER_05]: You have in your packet tonight some changes that I'm sure the superintendent would like to highlight before we open up for comments from the general public and your staff.

845
01:05:17,177 --> 01:05:18,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam Mayor and members of the committee.

846
01:05:19,018 --> 01:05:34,141
[SPEAKER_11]: At our meeting on the 15th, several items were identified by the committee as being important based on their conversations with members of the administration, faculty, and public with regard to the budget that was presented to you.

847
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:37,062
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to address each of those items.

848
01:05:37,461 --> 01:05:46,063
[SPEAKER_11]: you have the information in front of you and give you a little bit more information and answer any questions you have before we actually open the floor and take public comment.

849
01:05:47,443 --> 01:06:01,327
[SPEAKER_11]: The math coach at the elementary level will be added and funded under Title I. Title I normally has done literacy work in recent years, but we were able to free up some dollars from that.

850
01:06:01,387 --> 01:06:07,348
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a retirement in that field, and we're able to take some of the money from a higher end salary.

851
01:06:07,923 --> 01:06:14,006
[SPEAKER_11]: and also mix that with some reserve monies that come from Title I over the years that we carry over.

852
01:06:14,767 --> 01:06:19,249
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, the actual salary will be based upon the teacher's contract.

853
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:28,954
[SPEAKER_11]: The coach might come from the inside, and then a replacement salary might go for that position the person would be taking.

854
01:06:30,795 --> 01:06:35,858
[SPEAKER_11]: The emphasis would be primarily given to the Roberts, Columbus,

855
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:47,052
[SPEAKER_11]: And some at the McGlynn, at this point, we don't believe the Brooks is in much need of this particular position as the other schools that I've mentioned.

856
01:06:47,853 --> 01:06:51,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Secondly, a middle school librarian will be added to Block 029.

857
01:06:53,074 --> 01:06:56,795
[SPEAKER_11]: The salary will be based upon the teacher's contract, Bachelors 1, 48, 863.

858
01:06:57,635 --> 01:07:00,795
[SPEAKER_11]: The position will be shared between two schools.

859
01:07:01,616 --> 01:07:03,336
[SPEAKER_11]: The position will eliminate one

860
01:07:03,844 --> 01:07:07,507
[SPEAKER_11]: point five para position at 11 six nine Oh, which was a library aid.

861
01:07:08,308 --> 01:07:17,916
[SPEAKER_11]: The differential will be $37,173 and will be funded through combined savings generated by leaves of absences granted in the vocational and science department.

862
01:07:18,456 --> 01:07:29,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Since our meeting, some people have opted for leaves of absence and we're able to recover money again from the higher salary to the lowest salary to give us the money to fund this position.

863
01:07:30,447 --> 01:07:30,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Number three,

864
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:40,455
[SPEAKER_11]: A behavior specialist for the Columbus School was added by promoting a current paraprofessional in the SPED budget, who has recently earned the credentials to fulfill this role.

865
01:07:41,095 --> 01:07:42,997
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a non-unit position.

866
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:44,698
[SPEAKER_11]: The salary would be $40,000.

867
01:07:44,758 --> 01:07:48,200
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a behaviorist position.

868
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,560
[SPEAKER_11]: It's similar to a BCBA.

869
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,182
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not certified, but Kathy can explain that.

870
01:07:52,462 --> 01:07:55,504
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have one already on board, and they serve the same function.

871
01:07:55,524 --> 01:08:00,106
[SPEAKER_11]: They work closely with the BCBAs, and I think that will help a great deal.

872
01:08:01,742 --> 01:08:17,108
[SPEAKER_11]: The current parasalary is $21,639, so therefore, the projected savings from the mid-year retirement of a senior SPED teacher that was identified to us, the senior SPED teacher will be replaced at a lower salary consistent with the teacher's contract.

873
01:08:17,128 --> 01:08:21,950
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a new retirement that came in subsequent to our meeting on Wednesday.

874
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:28,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Four, three part-time kindergarten aides will be full-time at the Roberts.

875
01:08:29,322 --> 01:08:32,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Each will move from their current salary of $7,925 to $15,850.

876
01:08:33,304 --> 01:08:36,566
[SPEAKER_11]: This total increase will be $23,775.

877
01:08:36,866 --> 01:08:42,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Funding for this position will be taken from the revenue projections, which is listed in the budget book.

878
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:46,272
[SPEAKER_11]: I showed you where there was a revenue surplus that we put in.

879
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:51,035
[SPEAKER_11]: And assignments will be based upon the contract provisions of the paraprofessional contract.

880
01:08:52,676 --> 01:08:56,758
[SPEAKER_11]: The kindergarten money at the legislature is still up in the air.

881
01:08:57,879 --> 01:08:58,379
[SPEAKER_11]: It's suspect.

882
01:08:59,194 --> 01:09:03,696
[SPEAKER_11]: The House would like it, and the Senate is not agreeing right now.

883
01:09:04,537 --> 01:09:06,258
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what's happening to the conference committee.

884
01:09:06,698 --> 01:09:06,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Pardon me?

885
01:09:07,318 --> 01:09:07,658
Call.

886
01:09:08,038 --> 01:09:09,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody call your senator.

887
01:09:09,059 --> 01:09:09,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Call.

888
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:23,066
[SPEAKER_11]: We would hope they would at least extend it for another year, because when they make a decision at the tail end of a year, you don't have time to make the adjustments that you would if you knew it at the beginning of the year, that you're moving forward.

889
01:09:23,086 --> 01:09:25,667
[SPEAKER_11]: That's $150,000 in that grant.

890
01:09:28,142 --> 01:09:30,383
[SPEAKER_11]: that goes south, we'd have to find $150,000.

891
01:09:30,723 --> 01:09:41,426
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I can do it with other things that happen and other revenue projections, but it's not the kind of thing that you want to do because that takes away other flexibilities for things that come up during the year.

892
01:09:41,987 --> 01:09:47,048
[SPEAKER_11]: But this addresses the school that everyone felt was the most in need of this.

893
01:09:47,068 --> 01:09:55,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, the other three principals asked for other things and this would fulfill at least what the Roberts had asked for is as it's high priority.

894
01:09:56,121 --> 01:10:00,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Number five, the teacher specialist position at the McGlynn will be absorbed by existing personnel at that school.

895
01:10:01,584 --> 01:10:08,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Principal Guarino reviewed the situation after the meeting and made the decision with me.

896
01:10:08,088 --> 01:10:09,088
[SPEAKER_11]: She has an attached letter.

897
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:13,891
[SPEAKER_11]: While the possibility exists for an internal shift of personnel, the principal opted to use existing faculty.

898
01:10:13,911 --> 01:10:17,813
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have sent somebody over there, but she wanted to use her own faculty.

899
01:10:19,234 --> 01:10:25,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Number six, clerical assignments will be reviewed during the administrative week and decisions will be made regarding the realignment of personnel

900
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:27,636
[SPEAKER_11]: And naturally, we'll cover the most key positions.

901
01:10:28,156 --> 01:10:33,639
[SPEAKER_11]: There are two clerical positions which we did not fill based on retirements of individuals.

902
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:40,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Pat and I and others will be looking at how we can move some people around in order to give coverage to those positions.

903
01:10:41,424 --> 01:10:42,244
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll go from there.

904
01:10:44,545 --> 01:10:50,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Another piece that I handed you this evening was a piece with regard to the older musical instruments as surplus.

905
01:10:51,369 --> 01:10:52,610
[SPEAKER_11]: We checked with the city again.

906
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:59,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Chapter 30B sets out procedures to ensure that we obtain good value when we dispose of supplies.

907
01:10:59,783 --> 01:11:10,448
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have to go through a procurement process, but we will begin that procurement process if you agree that we can do that based on our discussions last week.

908
01:11:11,008 --> 01:11:20,412
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will use that money in the music department, fine arts department, primarily for the band, but if there's some other use that the committee discerns is

909
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,444
[SPEAKER_11]: of higher priority, we'll certainly look at that as well.

910
01:11:23,924 --> 01:11:25,585
[SPEAKER_11]: So these are the changes.

911
01:11:26,926 --> 01:11:36,931
[SPEAKER_11]: I would ask that you agree with me or that you give me a substitute that you think someone should consider so that we can move forward with the public hearing.

912
01:11:36,991 --> 01:11:44,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Before moving on to the budget piece, is there a motion on the floor to vote the equipment surplus?

913
01:11:44,935 --> 01:11:46,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you speak on this?

914
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:47,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

915
01:11:47,296 --> 01:11:47,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

916
01:11:47,356 --> 01:11:48,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Van de Kloot.

917
01:11:48,497 --> 01:11:50,738
[SPEAKER_09]: I spoke to Pat on the way in.

918
01:11:51,751 --> 01:11:56,974
[SPEAKER_09]: and noted that in the letter that it specified to be spent on new musical equipment.

919
01:11:57,915 --> 01:12:08,001
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it would be better to deposit back to the school department to be used by the fine arts department.

920
01:12:08,521 --> 01:12:15,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the needs that we heard last week from the band director was not necessarily musical equipment, but there were other needs.

921
01:12:15,646 --> 01:12:17,807
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to give us more leeway.

922
01:12:24,094 --> 01:12:24,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Music department?

923
01:12:25,457 --> 01:12:26,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Music department is fine.

924
01:12:30,105 --> 01:12:33,186
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's one vote that we need to vote surplus back.

925
01:12:34,726 --> 01:12:40,327
[SPEAKER_05]: One vote for surplus, and the second would be that we request the city council to put this into a gift account.

926
01:12:41,047 --> 01:12:41,987
[SPEAKER_05]: So two separate votes.

927
01:12:42,307 --> 01:12:43,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a question on the vote?

928
01:12:44,328 --> 01:12:44,488
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

929
01:12:44,508 --> 01:12:45,588
[SPEAKER_17]: Cuno.

930
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:54,670
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, I would even make it a little bit more specific from what we have heard, and that is to be utilized by the finance department.

931
01:12:55,510 --> 01:13:03,737
[SPEAKER_17]: but with the majority of it, actually, it was for the BN uniforms.

932
01:13:03,797 --> 01:13:07,080
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't... No, it was... No.

933
01:13:08,101 --> 01:13:09,402
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we can... Because it was...

934
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:15,133
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get the gift account set up and then we can come back and give you an idea.

935
01:13:15,173 --> 01:13:26,362
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, because the portion of that was we were taking away the five, but giving them, let's say, as an example, 15, they could subsequent use the five for the transportation.

936
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:32,581
[SPEAKER_17]: but the rest of it was for the band uniforms because that has been discussed in the past, but okay.

937
01:13:32,601 --> 01:13:34,803
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll bring it back to you in any case.

938
01:13:34,923 --> 01:13:35,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

939
01:13:35,283 --> 01:13:35,383
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

940
01:13:51,277 --> 01:13:53,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, 70 in the affirmative, none in the negative.

941
01:13:53,317 --> 01:13:54,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

942
01:13:54,698 --> 01:14:02,100
[SPEAKER_05]: On the second resolution that we recommend that the city council consider the surplus funds to be put into the gift account to be used for the music department.

943
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,720
[SPEAKER_05]: So the language as amended.

944
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:05,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion for approval?

945
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval.

946
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:06,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

947
01:14:06,481 --> 01:14:07,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Ms.

948
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:07,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Cuneo.

949
01:14:07,381 --> 01:14:08,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Ho, ho, ho.

950
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:08,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

951
01:14:09,141 --> 01:14:09,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Cuneo?

952
01:14:09,621 --> 01:14:09,921
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

953
01:14:10,521 --> 01:14:11,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

954
01:14:11,802 --> 01:14:12,182
Drexel?

955
01:14:12,222 --> 01:14:12,402
Yes.

956
01:14:25,168 --> 01:14:30,490
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wanted to address the budget modifications that the superintendent has given us.

957
01:14:31,470 --> 01:14:45,793
[SPEAKER_09]: In my mind, the superintendent has met the concerns that the school committee seemed fairly much in unison, as different as we all are,

958
01:14:46,287 --> 01:14:52,288
[SPEAKER_09]: there was a theme and these were definitely the ones that I was most concerned about and heard others speak to as well.

959
01:14:52,868 --> 01:15:02,130
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm very, very happy to see that money has been found for these, what I consider to be necessary items.

960
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:12,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to make a motion that the school committee affirm the Medford Public Schools budget for the year 2017

961
01:15:15,197 --> 01:15:18,079
[SPEAKER_09]: with the inclusion of these budget modifications.

962
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:22,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

963
01:15:22,861 --> 01:15:28,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a few questions, so if someone has a question before me, I'm willing to yield to them first.

964
01:15:33,405 --> 01:15:34,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

965
01:15:34,826 --> 01:15:36,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to be respectful.

966
01:15:37,647 --> 01:15:44,190
[SPEAKER_03]: So going through the actual budget book and some of these changes, I just want to go over

967
01:15:44,677 --> 01:15:48,840
[SPEAKER_03]: that what I wrote down is what we got and what cuts we had to make, okay?

968
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:51,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so I'm clear on everything.

969
01:15:51,682 --> 01:16:08,375
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as added personnel, we added 1.5 ELL teachers, one math teacher at the high school vocational school sharing it, an adjustment counselor, a high school English teacher, a behaviorist, and I'd like to know what their credentials are.

970
01:16:09,193 --> 01:16:09,573
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry?

971
01:16:09,973 --> 01:16:13,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what a behavioralist is compared to an ABA.

972
01:16:13,935 --> 01:16:14,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the difference.

973
01:16:14,735 --> 01:16:14,955
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

974
01:16:15,315 --> 01:16:23,979
[SPEAKER_11]: So a behaviorist has got similar kinds of skill sets, but they're not as advanced in these things.

975
01:16:23,999 --> 01:16:26,680
[SPEAKER_11]: But this individual is going to be taking that test fairly soon.

976
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:32,322
[SPEAKER_11]: But Kathy Medaglio is here, and she can comment on the individual who we've identified within the SPED budget.

977
01:16:34,813 --> 01:16:40,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I haven't spoken to the individual yet.

978
01:16:41,035 --> 01:16:49,557
[SPEAKER_07]: So a behavioral specialist would be someone who's highly trained in analyzing and intervening for children with behavioral disorders.

979
01:16:51,078 --> 01:16:58,620
[SPEAKER_07]: This individual has completed a BCBA course of study, has not yet sat for the exam or received the results.

980
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:02,141
[SPEAKER_07]: There's something like a three-month delay from the time that you take

981
01:17:02,586 --> 01:17:05,348
[SPEAKER_07]: the exam and actually receive your results, so.

982
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:09,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Will that person's salary have to change once they?

983
01:17:10,011 --> 01:17:17,715
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the individual will be hired as an assistant and be overseen or mentored by a BCBA in the district.

984
01:17:18,095 --> 01:17:18,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

985
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:21,958
[SPEAKER_03]: So we added the behavioralist.

986
01:17:22,018 --> 01:17:26,941
[SPEAKER_03]: We also added kindergarten needs to the Robins, from part-time to full-time.

987
01:17:27,901 --> 01:17:30,523
[SPEAKER_03]: A librarian for our middle schools and a math coach.

988
01:17:30,987 --> 01:17:34,830
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a lot of additions to the program.

989
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:40,814
[SPEAKER_03]: And from all the changes, I think that, I don't know if I missed anyone.

990
01:17:41,394 --> 01:17:59,207
[SPEAKER_03]: So cuts that I'm aware of, things that are not in the budget any longer are two secretarial positions, three Paris-fed positions, one teacher at the Curtis, one teacher at the Roberts because of class sizes, one high school opportunities for change person,

991
01:17:59,748 --> 01:18:06,370
[SPEAKER_03]: a teacher at the McGlynn Literacy Coach for grade K. Is that?

992
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:06,930
[SPEAKER_03]: You just let Ms.

993
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:07,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Corino address it.

994
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:08,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

995
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:08,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

996
01:18:09,731 --> 01:18:12,011
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was a clinical supervisor in special education.

997
01:18:12,031 --> 01:18:12,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you say that?

998
01:18:14,092 --> 01:18:14,152
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

999
01:18:14,192 --> 01:18:14,252
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1000
01:18:14,272 --> 01:18:15,272
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think I had that.

1001
01:18:16,532 --> 01:18:16,612
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1002
01:18:19,233 --> 01:18:19,573
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1003
01:18:20,413 --> 01:18:21,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make sure I have.

1004
01:18:22,194 --> 01:18:22,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I like lists.

1005
01:18:23,734 --> 01:18:23,834
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1006
01:18:23,854 --> 01:18:26,955
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so that's my first thing, just to go over what we've had and what we haven't.

1007
01:18:27,544 --> 01:18:32,025
[SPEAKER_03]: So secondly, I want to thank you for going back and looking at your budget more closely.

1008
01:18:32,085 --> 01:18:39,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I asked you to the other night and to really change things around and try to fit some of the needs that we heard the other evening.

1009
01:18:40,366 --> 01:18:48,788
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate the effort that you made to do that and bring us forward more things that this committee felt were very important in our priorities.

1010
01:18:49,208 --> 01:18:53,669
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm grateful for you doing that.

1011
01:18:54,618 --> 01:18:57,579
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want everything and a little bit more.

1012
01:18:58,420 --> 01:18:58,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything what?

1013
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,441
[SPEAKER_03]: That you just gave me and a little bit more, of course.

1014
01:19:01,461 --> 01:19:01,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Surprise.

1015
01:19:08,564 --> 01:19:24,110
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to let you know that I'm a little surprised about the principal at the McGlynn not needing that literacy, that person, because she said it was extremely important to her the other evening.

1016
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:25,681
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was surprised to read this.

1017
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:26,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe her.

1018
01:19:26,882 --> 01:19:28,182
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a letter in here from her.

1019
01:19:28,603 --> 01:19:34,687
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we see throughout the year that that need is great, I would like you to keep your eyes on that.

1020
01:19:35,347 --> 01:19:37,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know you do that throughout the year.

1021
01:19:37,268 --> 01:19:40,070
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my first request.

1022
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:42,152
[SPEAKER_03]: And reevaluate if necessary.

1023
01:19:42,192 --> 01:19:43,733
[SPEAKER_03]: And move staff if necessary.

1024
01:19:43,753 --> 01:19:44,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry?

1025
01:19:44,473 --> 01:19:47,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Reevaluate and move staff if that becomes necessary.

1026
01:19:49,336 --> 01:19:53,279
[SPEAKER_03]: So I also received, as my colleagues did, an email from the Columbus

1027
01:19:53,883 --> 01:20:00,187
[SPEAKER_03]: school teachers about the need of full-time kindergarten aides.

1028
01:20:00,347 --> 01:20:14,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I know you've given us some this year, and we're making progress, but throughout this district, the needs of students coming in to kindergarten, and I see this not only in our district, but in the districts that I visit and the district that I work in.

1029
01:20:15,778 --> 01:20:23,363
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of children come in with a lot of needs, and as a school committee member, I'm gonna tell you directly, like I have many, many times,

1030
01:20:23,857 --> 01:20:25,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I want full-time aides in our kindergartens.

1031
01:20:26,878 --> 01:20:32,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that it's not in this year's budget, and I know that you can't afford to do it, especially with the revenue for the state.

1032
01:20:32,779 --> 01:20:45,563
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm letting you know for next year, Mr. Bellson, what I would like to see in your budget, the first thing I want to hear is when you walk in the door, is that we are going to go district-wide with full-time kindergarten aides.

1033
01:20:46,143 --> 01:20:47,683
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my second comment.

1034
01:20:47,703 --> 01:20:49,684
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you for the ones at the Roberts for now.

1035
01:20:52,045 --> 01:20:52,165
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1036
01:20:54,143 --> 01:21:02,210
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm thrilled to see the librarian, because the librarians, like I kept saying the other night, first cut, last reinstated.

1037
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:05,012
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for listening and hearing on that matter.

1038
01:21:05,272 --> 01:21:13,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would love to see her reaction when she found out that this was being added to her staff.

1039
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:15,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Has someone told her?

1040
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,281
[SPEAKER_15]: Does Ms.

1041
01:21:16,321 --> 01:21:16,941
[SPEAKER_15]: Dorsey know?

1042
01:21:17,842 --> 01:21:18,442
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I don't know.

1043
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:19,603
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll find out.

1044
01:21:19,643 --> 01:21:21,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Trotta knows, so he would be your supervisor.

1045
01:21:22,105 --> 01:21:22,226
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1046
01:21:23,207 --> 01:21:26,529
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if someone could take that picture, I would really like to see that.

1047
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:34,192
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's another thing that I really want to talk to you about and thank you for.

1048
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:43,576
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as the clerical assignments, you know, we cut a lot in the past.

1049
01:21:43,636 --> 01:21:44,577
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really important.

1050
01:21:44,617 --> 01:21:45,777
[SPEAKER_03]: They work very hard.

1051
01:21:46,257 --> 01:21:50,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I think cuts are just making more people work harder for the same money.

1052
01:21:52,390 --> 01:21:56,031
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really have a problem cutting these jobs.

1053
01:21:57,851 --> 01:22:04,472
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're vital to our school community, and they're the first people that our parents reach out to before they come to us.

1054
01:22:04,972 --> 01:22:20,135
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that said, I'm wondering if, since you weren't able to change the PR person, if any of those duties or some of those duties can be reassigned, because if that person has time to help out that department, I would like to see that happen.

1055
01:22:21,738 --> 01:22:23,680
[SPEAKER_11]: So let me try and answer that this way.

1056
01:22:25,101 --> 01:22:33,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Anytime I make a cut from something that I've got, most of the time, not always, there are a couple of things that I probably can reevaluate and say that wasn't a great move.

1057
01:22:33,948 --> 01:22:38,231
[SPEAKER_11]: But most of the time, it means that there's going to be something that's lost.

1058
01:22:39,432 --> 01:22:47,799
[SPEAKER_11]: But in this instance, the challenge to us is to take a look at the full fleet of clerical assistants and to reposition some people.

1059
01:22:48,516 --> 01:23:00,940
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's probably highly likely that within the area of special education, Kathy's smiling out there, that, you know, there'll be some adjustment in that area and move away from something else.

1060
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:05,801
[SPEAKER_11]: But every area, every area has got to be scrutinized.

1061
01:23:05,861 --> 01:23:12,383
[SPEAKER_11]: And from time to time, we see that maybe certain jobs can be consolidated, certain things can be shared, and we do that.

1062
01:23:13,023 --> 01:23:16,744
[SPEAKER_11]: If we can't do that, we'll never ever be able to balance a budget.

1063
01:23:17,501 --> 01:23:19,521
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll always be add, add, add, and add later.

1064
01:23:19,581 --> 01:23:20,602
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have to look at that.

1065
01:23:20,682 --> 01:23:43,325
[SPEAKER_11]: So the challenge is to us not to ignore the good work that's done by the clerical staff, but to reposition it in such a way so that we can do the work with maybe a few less people from time to time or find that if we have to add a person, when we go back over during the summer, we'll come back and tell you we added a person and we'll find the money for it.

1066
01:23:43,365 --> 01:23:46,046
[SPEAKER_11]: So, but this is the beginning of a budget.

1067
01:23:46,066 --> 01:23:46,826
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a process.

1068
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:54,612
[SPEAKER_11]: And just as I came back this evening with these adjustments, I may come back with some more and say, we can do some more things.

1069
01:23:55,112 --> 01:24:01,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Or I might have to come back and say, you know, there's something that's happening to us at the state, the federal level, and we may have to pull back on something that we wanted to do.

1070
01:24:02,458 --> 01:24:03,760
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's the nature of budgeting.

1071
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,341
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the nature of process.

1072
01:24:05,401 --> 01:24:06,922
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, but I hear you.

1073
01:24:07,062 --> 01:24:10,705
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, it's no animus towards any particular type of position or any person.

1074
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:14,969
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really just simply a function of trying to find what the balances are.

1075
01:24:16,103 --> 01:24:18,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if I could continue if that's all right.

1076
01:24:19,425 --> 01:24:19,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1077
01:24:20,986 --> 01:24:24,048
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I really appreciate the things you gave us.

1078
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:31,914
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that PR person, and you and I don't agree on this, she's given years of service to our community and she's done excellent work.

1079
01:24:32,134 --> 01:24:40,359
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really appreciate her years of service and all the things she's done in our community, but the

1080
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:45,299
[SPEAKER_03]: The cost is very expensive in our budget.

1081
01:24:45,499 --> 01:24:47,780
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to reiterate it like I did the other night.

1082
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:59,286
[SPEAKER_03]: With all due respect to the person in the job, I wonder if we could not get an intern or have it handled in a different way and free up this person to do some other vital work.

1083
01:24:59,306 --> 01:25:00,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1084
01:25:00,507 --> 01:25:06,730
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is an expense that I don't think our schools really should be allocating funds towards just this.

1085
01:25:07,091 --> 01:25:08,611
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a lot of money in our budget.

1086
01:25:11,271 --> 01:25:14,573
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to voice what I think is right and that's what I'm doing.

1087
01:25:14,954 --> 01:25:20,418
[SPEAKER_11]: So I answered you in my opening remarks in my budget delivery that I felt it was a strong hire.

1088
01:25:20,959 --> 01:25:24,021
[SPEAKER_11]: I felt that the individual brought a lot to the table.

1089
01:25:24,261 --> 01:25:25,903
[SPEAKER_11]: 28 years of experience in the community.

1090
01:25:26,843 --> 01:25:30,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Significant knowledge of the networks of where people are.

1091
01:25:30,827 --> 01:25:35,168
[SPEAKER_11]: The amount of coverage that we have received in the last several months is unreal.

1092
01:25:35,709 --> 01:25:39,410
[SPEAKER_11]: The amount of activity on the blog and on the webpage is huge.

1093
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:43,271
[SPEAKER_11]: And that we've got 29 less kids going to charter schools right now.

1094
01:25:43,831 --> 01:25:49,313
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got significantly more youngsters coming back from other areas.

1095
01:25:49,493 --> 01:25:52,014
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've got a larger kindergarten enrollment.

1096
01:25:52,054 --> 01:25:55,335
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think a lot of it has to do with people knowing something about our school system.

1097
01:25:55,795 --> 01:25:58,816
[SPEAKER_11]: The other night, I happened to listen to the city council.

1098
01:25:59,057 --> 01:26:00,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Why I did that, I have no idea.

1099
01:26:01,033 --> 01:26:03,314
[SPEAKER_11]: But I was listening to the city council.

1100
01:26:04,074 --> 01:26:10,336
[SPEAKER_11]: And while I was listening to the city council, I heard them talk about the lack of communication about things.

1101
01:26:10,356 --> 01:26:11,297
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't know about this.

1102
01:26:11,357 --> 01:26:12,377
[SPEAKER_11]: And they didn't know about that.

1103
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:16,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the school department tells people about a lot of things going on.

1104
01:26:16,258 --> 01:26:18,099
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe not everybody pays attention.

1105
01:26:18,139 --> 01:26:24,281
[SPEAKER_11]: But we have got a real strong public information process underway.

1106
01:26:24,621 --> 01:26:25,802
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to keep it that way.

1107
01:26:25,822 --> 01:26:27,282
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's in your best interest.

1108
01:26:27,702 --> 01:26:29,083
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's your decision to make.

1109
01:26:30,618 --> 01:26:31,699
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my recommendation.

1110
01:26:31,779 --> 01:26:32,420
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't cut it.

1111
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:41,947
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think it's overpaid, because I think if you take a teacher today, for 10 months, they make, a senior teacher with 11 years experience makes almost $90,000 with a master's degree.

1112
01:26:42,828 --> 01:26:46,551
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't think it's an unreasonable salary.

1113
01:26:46,571 --> 01:26:51,355
[SPEAKER_11]: I gave you this slip a short time ago about what people paid.

1114
01:26:52,236 --> 01:26:53,297
[SPEAKER_11]: If you bought a house in 1964, it was $13,000.

1115
01:26:53,377 --> 01:26:54,338
[SPEAKER_11]: If you bought a car, it was $3,500.

1116
01:26:54,378 --> 01:26:56,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Your starting salary for a teacher

1117
01:27:00,419 --> 01:27:04,121
[SPEAKER_11]: $6,000, starting salary for any job is $6,000 in 64.

1118
01:27:04,802 --> 01:27:06,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Things are different today.

1119
01:27:06,583 --> 01:27:07,603
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to be competitive.

1120
01:27:08,083 --> 01:27:09,664
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got to have good people in place.

1121
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:17,769
[SPEAKER_11]: The knowledge this individual brings to the community, the knowledge, the work ethic the person brings to the community is invaluable and has my strong support.

1122
01:27:18,269 --> 01:27:18,989
[SPEAKER_11]: It's your decision.

1123
01:27:19,189 --> 01:27:19,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I follow up?

1124
01:27:21,731 --> 01:27:21,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1125
01:27:22,491 --> 01:27:29,655
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe the city council needs her help and we could split it among the city and the school department and have one PR person for both

1126
01:27:30,035 --> 01:27:31,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's something we need to look at.

1127
01:27:31,715 --> 01:27:33,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you.

1128
01:27:34,776 --> 01:27:35,836
[SPEAKER_03]: He just gave me the idea.

1129
01:27:35,856 --> 01:27:36,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1130
01:27:37,576 --> 01:27:42,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to finish, I had some specific questions about budget, but I'm taking a long time.

1131
01:27:42,737 --> 01:27:45,778
[SPEAKER_03]: So if someone wanted to jump in with their questions, I'll ask them at the end.

1132
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:56,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the weekend while I was away, Lisa Evangelista, the PR person,

1133
01:27:56,974 --> 01:28:03,098
[SPEAKER_00]: She shared an article that was in the Boston Globe when the Salamanders were released that made it to the Globe.

1134
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:06,520
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was away, out of town, and I was notified in an email.

1135
01:28:06,861 --> 01:28:07,561
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just wonderful.

1136
01:28:07,621 --> 01:28:08,302
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so happy.

1137
01:28:08,322 --> 01:28:11,824
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh my gosh, this article in the paper is about the Salamanders.

1138
01:28:11,924 --> 01:28:13,165
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just wonderful.

1139
01:28:13,565 --> 01:28:20,550
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I think, I mean, when I first ran for office, I wanted to do my own PR.

1140
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:22,091
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to capture every story.

1141
01:28:22,111 --> 01:28:23,171
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get every picture.

1142
01:28:23,191 --> 01:28:24,032
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get it out there.

1143
01:28:24,512 --> 01:28:25,693
[SPEAKER_00]: And I created a website.

1144
01:28:26,318 --> 01:28:35,286
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't do my job at work and then on the school committee and keep up with the pictures and the articles and the stories, but I wanted to.

1145
01:28:36,207 --> 01:28:36,767
[SPEAKER_00]: But I couldn't.

1146
01:28:36,987 --> 01:28:37,448
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried.

1147
01:28:38,188 --> 01:28:44,734
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like, I think I almost tried to mimic what Lisa was doing for the whole community.

1148
01:28:45,405 --> 01:28:47,627
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a job on its own.

1149
01:28:48,248 --> 01:29:02,401
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I would go home at night, and I would try to do my pictures, and do my posts, and do the article, and write it in such a way, and then it was so late, and I was making mistakes, you know, because I was trying to squeeze it in, to get the information out there on Facebook.

1150
01:29:02,761 --> 01:29:05,463
[SPEAKER_00]: to share with the community, this is what our schools are doing.

1151
01:29:06,223 --> 01:29:20,150
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually, I mean, I really enjoy it because, you know, while we're at work and while we're going about our business, even on the weekend, you know, she's still working or getting those posts out there that can be shared with everybody.

1152
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:25,473
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just really like it, you know, and I tell her all the time, and Allison,

1153
01:29:26,349 --> 01:29:30,831
[SPEAKER_00]: I just really like hearing what's going on and reading about the students and everything that's going on.

1154
01:29:31,591 --> 01:29:33,171
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of makes my weekend, you know.

1155
01:29:33,592 --> 01:29:34,832
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just wanted to share it.

1156
01:29:34,872 --> 01:29:35,272
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

1157
01:29:35,592 --> 01:29:37,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1158
01:29:38,173 --> 01:29:41,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Mia, did you have a comment on this as well, on this topic in general?

1159
01:29:41,814 --> 01:29:44,635
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, about the one patient.

1160
01:29:44,715 --> 01:29:45,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Ms.

1161
01:29:45,136 --> 01:29:47,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Cuno is in line on other questions as well.

1162
01:29:48,357 --> 01:29:49,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you really wish to forward?

1163
01:29:50,057 --> 01:29:51,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I will, and I'll come back because I don't want to.

1164
01:29:52,690 --> 01:29:53,110
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1165
01:29:53,170 --> 01:29:58,795
[SPEAKER_17]: First of all, I want to thank the superintendent, Pat Vila, to find or rearrange the money for us.

1166
01:29:59,135 --> 01:30:02,057
[SPEAKER_17]: As a committee, we all wanted, and we all agreed to what we wanted.

1167
01:30:02,218 --> 01:30:07,362
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I do thank you for that, because there's a lot of what we had all asked for here.

1168
01:30:09,784 --> 01:30:12,826
[SPEAKER_17]: I am looking at the middle school librarian that you've added.

1169
01:30:13,286 --> 01:30:17,630
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, that middle school librarian, is there going to be one in each school, or are they going to share that one?

1170
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:18,310
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to share that one.

1171
01:30:18,411 --> 01:30:21,393
[SPEAKER_17]: They're sharing that, but they're keeping the assistance that they have, correct?

1172
01:30:21,921 --> 01:30:25,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there's one assistant position that will be dropped down.

1173
01:30:26,505 --> 01:30:33,190
[SPEAKER_11]: But they'll have a full-time librarian and a part-time assistant, I mean, in each place.

1174
01:30:34,071 --> 01:30:41,757
[SPEAKER_11]: So they can have a full-time librarian for both schools and also an assistant will go between the buildings when the other librarian is gone.

1175
01:30:41,777 --> 01:30:43,839
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, so the assistant is going, but the librarian?

1176
01:30:43,859 --> 01:30:47,422
[SPEAKER_11]: The librarian will work both buildings, but the assistant will also work both buildings.

1177
01:30:48,663 --> 01:30:48,743
[SPEAKER_17]: OK?

1178
01:30:49,667 --> 01:30:53,570
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing is that I know that we spoke about the kindergarten aides.

1179
01:30:54,711 --> 01:30:58,715
[SPEAKER_17]: It was important that we listened to what the principals of the schools wanted.

1180
01:30:59,595 --> 01:31:01,317
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that gave us an insight.

1181
01:31:01,617 --> 01:31:06,481
[SPEAKER_17]: And I agree that we should have the full-time aides.

1182
01:31:06,641 --> 01:31:09,844
[SPEAKER_17]: However, I also think it's very important that we had to listen to what

1183
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,422
[SPEAKER_17]: the principals of those schools really needed.

1184
01:31:12,902 --> 01:31:19,948
[SPEAKER_17]: With that being said, now that we are giving the full-time aides to the Roberts, as always, I'd like to have some type of report.

1185
01:31:19,988 --> 01:31:24,171
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, we can't have it at the beginning of the year because there would be no information.

1186
01:31:24,732 --> 01:31:29,736
[SPEAKER_17]: But at least by the middle of the year, end of the year, an update on how the full-time aides are working out.

1187
01:31:31,457 --> 01:31:33,618
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it working out to what they were expecting?

1188
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:41,901
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that there was a lot of discussion on, you know, spending more quality time and trying to teach students and trying to do certain things with our students.

1189
01:31:42,281 --> 01:32:00,088
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just want to make sure that that's that's what is going on, because it is, as we discussed at the meeting last week, is that even if we decided to do this now for the Roberts, it's something that we all have to look at for the district, because that is something that we all want the equality across the board with.

1190
01:32:01,371 --> 01:32:05,014
[SPEAKER_17]: But we do understand the restrictions of the finances.

1191
01:32:05,675 --> 01:32:22,950
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing I was looking at is even though I know the McGlynn School principal had written, the elementary school principal had written that with structure of different students now and that there's going to be less students, that maybe she will not be meeting the professionalists that she was asking for.

1192
01:32:23,991 --> 01:32:25,793
[SPEAKER_17]: With that, I still want to make sure that

1193
01:32:26,603 --> 01:32:34,048
[SPEAKER_17]: We make sure that we are updated on that, that all our students have the ability, that they are getting the time that they need.

1194
01:32:34,449 --> 01:32:43,255
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not just being rushed because I do want to make sure that, you know, each school asks for something and I want to make sure that each school gets

1195
01:32:43,745 --> 01:32:45,065
[SPEAKER_17]: at least what they had asked for.

1196
01:32:46,366 --> 01:32:57,068
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, even if it's not a full-time position, if we can look at it into, you know, a part-time position, or again, if we could look at it, if the kindergarten aid is something that's more important over there.

1197
01:32:57,509 --> 01:33:02,790
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I'm not- Principal's given multiple options, and we could have adjusted a teaching schedule to do that.

1198
01:33:02,830 --> 01:33:03,890
[SPEAKER_11]: She chose not to do that.

1199
01:33:04,050 --> 01:33:06,391
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so I just want to make sure that we're all clear on that.

1200
01:33:07,431 --> 01:33:10,832
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see, there was something else I did want to ask, and that is,

1201
01:33:12,112 --> 01:33:26,464
[SPEAKER_17]: As far as the HR person, I know to some of my colleagues they weren't involved with this discussion, but I do know that this discussion had been something that the previous committees were concerned with, parents were concerned with.

1202
01:33:27,293 --> 01:33:28,994
[SPEAKER_17]: and administration was concerned with.

1203
01:33:29,094 --> 01:33:33,696
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was we were hearing from other districts that actually had positions of HR.

1204
01:33:34,036 --> 01:33:38,778
[SPEAKER_17]: And we kept on sitting here week after week saying, what are we going to do to get our voice out there?

1205
01:33:38,878 --> 01:33:41,879
[SPEAKER_17]: What are we going to do to get more of what our district is doing?

1206
01:33:42,259 --> 01:33:46,821
[SPEAKER_17]: What are we going to do more to have people understand and know what our students are achieving?

1207
01:33:47,401 --> 01:33:51,303
[SPEAKER_17]: And each and every week, we always came out with, OK, we'll try to have a subcommittee meeting.

1208
01:33:51,743 --> 01:33:53,644
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll try to get some articles out there.

1209
01:33:54,004 --> 01:33:56,805
[SPEAKER_17]: The superintendent tried to get a blog going.

1210
01:33:57,488 --> 01:33:58,248
[SPEAKER_17]: It's impossible.

1211
01:33:58,908 --> 01:34:06,370
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't do what we're doing in a full-time capacity and still being in the positions that we're in.

1212
01:34:06,890 --> 01:34:08,630
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have the capability of it.

1213
01:34:08,850 --> 01:34:10,211
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have the expertise of it.

1214
01:34:10,251 --> 01:34:14,051
[SPEAKER_17]: And we don't have the networking of it if it was our full-time job.

1215
01:34:15,252 --> 01:34:20,413
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that there is discussion out there because the amount of money does seem high.

1216
01:34:20,653 --> 01:34:22,393
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that when we had this discussion,

1217
01:34:24,088 --> 01:34:25,169
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, how long have we had her?

1218
01:34:25,189 --> 01:34:29,011
[SPEAKER_17]: We've only had her now for, is it seven months?

1219
01:34:29,631 --> 01:34:30,571
[SPEAKER_17]: Hasn't been the full year.

1220
01:34:30,671 --> 01:34:32,132
[SPEAKER_11]: We added it at the half point of the year.

1221
01:34:32,172 --> 01:34:39,095
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we've only had, that I know that the discussion was going to be, let's wait, let's give her the chance to at least put in a year.

1222
01:34:39,615 --> 01:34:42,477
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see what's going to be different in our system.

1223
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:44,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see what other things are going out.

1224
01:34:44,718 --> 01:34:51,141
[SPEAKER_17]: And I have to say, there has been articles, there has been blogs, there has been, you know, less students going to charter schools.

1225
01:34:51,181 --> 01:34:53,663
[SPEAKER_17]: There are less students going to middle man.

1226
01:34:54,103 --> 01:34:56,264
[SPEAKER_17]: Am I saying it was just the HR person?

1227
01:34:56,724 --> 01:34:56,905
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1228
01:34:57,225 --> 01:35:03,168
[SPEAKER_17]: But what I am saying is that I think it's the combination of the work that everybody's doing together to get the word out there.

1229
01:35:03,622 --> 01:35:23,404
[SPEAKER_17]: week after week we've been badgered in here saying we don't as a school committee and as a district I mean we were even accused what we had no science curriculum in the high school with the new science labs and everything that we have but we had students in here week after week receiving awards and those awards didn't come from us those awards came from the state

1230
01:35:24,004 --> 01:35:26,645
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want people to know what we're doing.

1231
01:35:27,326 --> 01:35:30,707
[SPEAKER_17]: So, again, it's not saying let's not have her or have her.

1232
01:35:30,767 --> 01:35:40,933
[SPEAKER_17]: I just think that we have to do our due diligence and make sure that if we said we were going to keep at least a year to see what the ramifications were going to be, it's something that we need to do.

1233
01:35:41,353 --> 01:35:42,473
[SPEAKER_17]: And we all voted for that.

1234
01:35:42,573 --> 01:35:43,794
[SPEAKER_17]: The superintendent brought it to us.

1235
01:35:44,154 --> 01:35:46,535
[SPEAKER_17]: But as a committee, it was voted on.

1236
01:35:46,555 --> 01:35:48,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1237
01:35:48,496 --> 01:35:48,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1238
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:49,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Mastone.

1239
01:35:49,237 --> 01:35:50,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thanks, Mayor.

1240
01:35:52,346 --> 01:35:56,649
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have asked for more if I knew in five days you would have given us those six things.

1241
01:35:58,451 --> 01:35:59,652
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do have a question.

1242
01:35:59,672 --> 01:36:00,733
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's through you.

1243
01:36:01,914 --> 01:36:05,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Two of my six children are inclusion classes, and they are wonderful.

1244
01:36:05,697 --> 01:36:08,078
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's been very beneficial for my kids.

1245
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:19,047
[SPEAKER_08]: But a teacher did ask me if I knew if there is a cap to the number of children who require a para who can be in a class.

1246
01:36:19,107 --> 01:36:20,728
[SPEAKER_08]: So say you're in an inclusion class with 20

1247
01:36:22,228 --> 01:36:26,430
[SPEAKER_08]: or 18 without an IEP, how many can you have with one parent?

1248
01:36:26,630 --> 01:36:29,572
[SPEAKER_11]: So it varies with regard to the type of class.

1249
01:36:29,612 --> 01:36:33,994
[SPEAKER_11]: A regular education class, it's in the contract with the Teachers Association.

1250
01:36:34,074 --> 01:36:34,674
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty high.

1251
01:36:35,534 --> 01:36:39,076
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's, you know, I'm not sure off the top of my head, but it's in the high 20s.

1252
01:36:39,256 --> 01:36:39,516
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1253
01:36:39,816 --> 01:36:45,999
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, you know, it would be because remember, this idea of really small class size, relatively new.

1254
01:36:46,019 --> 01:36:46,059
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1255
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:49,221
[SPEAKER_11]: There were years when, you know, class sizes were 28, 29, 30, and so on and so forth.

1256
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:54,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Our class sizes are a lot lower than what people were used to.

1257
01:36:54,856 --> 01:37:01,158
[SPEAKER_11]: So when these contracts were written, they were written with upper 20s as being the example for regular classes.

1258
01:37:01,638 --> 01:37:03,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Now in special ed, it depends on the type of class.

1259
01:37:04,599 --> 01:37:10,081
[SPEAKER_11]: If a special ed youngster is in a classroom that's self-contained, it's one to eight.

1260
01:37:11,001 --> 01:37:13,962
[SPEAKER_11]: If it goes beyond that, there would be another pair required.

1261
01:37:14,502 --> 01:37:18,183
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's less than that, it may just simply be on the severity of the type of classroom it is.

1262
01:37:18,923 --> 01:37:20,744
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so there's not any

1263
01:37:21,968 --> 01:37:23,409
[SPEAKER_08]: number or specific.

1264
01:37:24,230 --> 01:37:25,551
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Kathy, I guess I can speak to this.

1265
01:37:25,571 --> 01:37:26,111
[SPEAKER_08]: It's legal.

1266
01:37:26,191 --> 01:37:27,212
[SPEAKER_11]: It's by regulation.

1267
01:37:27,452 --> 01:37:34,797
[SPEAKER_08]: My fifth grader last year was in a classroom that had a full-time parent, the lead teacher, and then a part-time parent when the child was pulled in.

1268
01:37:36,498 --> 01:37:48,987
[SPEAKER_07]: So, within a general education classroom, there is no legal requirement or number to limit the number of special education students who are placed in that classroom.

1269
01:37:50,511 --> 01:37:52,593
[SPEAKER_07]: All of our classrooms are inclusion classrooms.

1270
01:37:53,053 --> 01:38:00,259
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some classrooms that are staffed with additional support because there are specific students who require that support.

1271
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:03,642
[SPEAKER_07]: And those decisions are made on a very individual basis.

1272
01:38:04,543 --> 01:38:07,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes a student may require a one-to-one support.

1273
01:38:08,086 --> 01:38:10,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it's just a second adult in the classroom.

1274
01:38:11,709 --> 01:38:16,433
[SPEAKER_07]: And the majority of our students don't require any additional support in the Gen Ed classroom.

1275
01:38:16,733 --> 01:38:19,235
[SPEAKER_07]: But that question does come up periodically.

1276
01:38:19,858 --> 01:38:26,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Because within special education classrooms, there are very closely monitored class size requirements.

1277
01:38:27,443 --> 01:38:32,866
[SPEAKER_07]: But there is no legal class size requirement for general education classrooms.

1278
01:38:33,647 --> 01:38:34,327
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1279
01:38:34,967 --> 01:38:37,689
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can only talk about my Tegan's fourth grade year.

1280
01:38:37,729 --> 01:38:43,372
[SPEAKER_08]: So she had one full-time para who helped four students in her class.

1281
01:38:43,453 --> 01:38:47,475
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the para came in part-time with a student that was pulled in for certain classes.

1282
01:38:47,515 --> 01:38:48,856
[SPEAKER_08]: So a teacher asked me.

1283
01:38:49,871 --> 01:38:50,571
[SPEAKER_08]: at the Roberts.

1284
01:38:51,452 --> 01:38:58,974
[SPEAKER_08]: So how many, so there's no number of like, you could have 10 kids who have, it would help to have a parent in one class with one?

1285
01:38:59,634 --> 01:39:04,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Theoretically you could, but I think common sense prevails.

1286
01:39:04,876 --> 01:39:09,177
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to look at what the needs of the students are and how all of their needs can be best met.

1287
01:39:09,818 --> 01:39:15,760
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are situations where there might be one student and that's a stressor.

1288
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:19,661
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are other situations where there are, there could be 10 students in a classroom.

1289
01:39:21,017 --> 01:39:23,239
[SPEAKER_07]: and everything's working well.

1290
01:39:23,339 --> 01:39:29,743
[SPEAKER_07]: So it really depends on the individual students and what their needs are, the other supports that are available.

1291
01:39:30,603 --> 01:39:46,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so then, I guess because this budget is all new to me, so if you come, I don't know, when you do your placements in August, so will there be maybe a possibility to be hiring more paras if a class or a grade has that many more needs?

1292
01:39:47,642 --> 01:39:49,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Or like is what we have as Paris done?

1293
01:39:49,784 --> 01:39:57,170
[SPEAKER_07]: We have most of our paraprofessionals are in place because there are specific student needs that they are associated with.

1294
01:39:58,591 --> 01:40:06,177
[SPEAKER_07]: So when there's no longer a need, the positions close because there are always new positions that are emerging or needs that emerge.

1295
01:40:06,878 --> 01:40:15,044
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not like you have a fifth grade classroom and automatically there's going to be a paraprofessional support in that classroom.

1296
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:21,080
[SPEAKER_07]: That would only happen if there are specific students going into that classroom who require support.

1297
01:40:22,401 --> 01:40:26,903
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is that potential that we could have students move into the district.

1298
01:40:27,383 --> 01:40:35,328
[SPEAKER_07]: We have students who are evaluated and maybe they have a re-evaluation that's taken place in September.

1299
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:39,550
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, sometimes we do need to increase staff.

1300
01:40:40,650 --> 01:40:41,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Kathy.

1301
01:40:41,511 --> 01:40:45,473
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was part of what I attempted to express the other night.

1302
01:40:46,192 --> 01:40:47,813
[SPEAKER_07]: with the elimination of positions.

1303
01:40:48,193 --> 01:41:00,477
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just if we left all positions in place as is, then as newly emerging needs arise, we would just continue to grow and grow, and then that wouldn't be helpful to anyone.

1304
01:41:00,517 --> 01:41:04,119
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's important to close and then reopen as needed.

1305
01:41:04,139 --> 01:41:04,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1306
01:41:05,279 --> 01:41:05,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1307
01:41:05,699 --> 01:41:07,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1308
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:08,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1309
01:41:08,561 --> 01:41:09,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Mayor.

1310
01:41:11,822 --> 01:41:14,923
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I just want to add one thing in that for the Paris that

1311
01:41:15,435 --> 01:41:28,124
[SPEAKER_09]: are brought in from special education, that's also part of the IEP process of determining whether a particular student, what they need or how it works.

1312
01:41:28,184 --> 01:41:30,225
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's where it's sort of spelled out.

1313
01:41:31,986 --> 01:41:44,675
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I just really wanted to say that the other night when we did our budget, I think that there was some level of frustration because obviously we had needs or desires that we thought were

1314
01:41:45,095 --> 01:41:45,555
[SPEAKER_09]: essential.

1315
01:41:46,256 --> 01:41:51,199
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know, Mia, at some point you said, what is the point of all this?

1316
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:58,825
[SPEAKER_09]: And kind of said, you know, there is a level of trust working with the superintendent.

1317
01:41:59,145 --> 01:42:06,090
[SPEAKER_09]: But the point of all of it was we went through the budget and we identified key areas that we believed were critical.

1318
01:42:07,051 --> 01:42:11,614
[SPEAKER_09]: And that there was a real purpose to that work the other night.

1319
01:42:11,854 --> 01:42:14,756
[SPEAKER_09]: And now you've seen the fruition of it tonight.

1320
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:25,824
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that we're also saying and realizing, you know, again, this budget is a, you sort of set the bottom line, but there was movement with it depending on what the needs are.

1321
01:42:26,525 --> 01:42:29,766
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a static document.

1322
01:42:30,987 --> 01:42:31,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1323
01:42:32,407 --> 01:42:33,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

1324
01:42:33,508 --> 01:42:37,009
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we do have a public hearing coming up, so wait for it.

1325
01:42:37,369 --> 01:42:38,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, guys.

1326
01:42:39,870 --> 01:42:42,572
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have some specific questions from my budget book.

1327
01:42:43,492 --> 01:42:43,652
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1328
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:48,281
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so mostly under the grant section.

1329
01:42:48,862 --> 01:42:49,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

1330
01:42:49,322 --> 01:42:49,682
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1331
01:42:50,322 --> 01:42:55,125
[SPEAKER_03]: So I noticed that you have a health services nurse under a grant.

1332
01:42:55,605 --> 01:43:08,672
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know because I administer the MassHealth program at another district that if the nurse's salary is under a grant, then it's hard to bill MassHealth for service time.

1333
01:43:09,353 --> 01:43:13,795
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just wondering why a nurse's salary would be under that.

1334
01:43:14,215 --> 01:43:16,596
[SPEAKER_11]: We receive money from the Department of Public Health.

1335
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:21,457
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a school health services grant that we have had for many years.

1336
01:43:21,957 --> 01:43:24,298
[SPEAKER_11]: This pays for part of the salary of one nurse.

1337
01:43:24,378 --> 01:43:25,758
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't pay the total salary.

1338
01:43:26,238 --> 01:43:27,838
[SPEAKER_11]: It pays a portion of that salary.

1339
01:43:28,218 --> 01:43:32,680
[SPEAKER_11]: So a portion of the salary is in the grant section, and a portion is in the health services section.

1340
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:35,720
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can bill MassHealth for the portions?

1341
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:36,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1342
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:39,201
[SPEAKER_11]: We bill to both accounts, and we keep a record so that it can be audited.

1343
01:43:39,761 --> 01:43:40,021
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1344
01:43:40,502 --> 01:43:41,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Just checking on that.

1345
01:43:42,895 --> 01:43:47,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And secondly is I see that there is a listing under grants.

1346
01:43:49,977 --> 01:43:59,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So what brought it to my attention is that there is a library meteor instructional teacher position under library meteor and they have a salary of $97,136.

1347
01:43:59,861 --> 01:44:01,981
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you look under grants, it's under TriTech.

1348
01:44:07,928 --> 01:44:14,013
[SPEAKER_03]: And I won't say the position's name, but there's another salary allocated for $17,682.

1349
01:44:15,354 --> 01:44:19,257
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you would combine the two, that person would make $114,828.

1350
01:44:19,317 --> 01:44:25,741
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me explain it so we can go right through it for you.

1351
01:44:26,162 --> 01:44:27,843
[SPEAKER_11]: The individual is Molly Layden.

1352
01:44:28,343 --> 01:44:34,708
[SPEAKER_11]: The individual has been and continues to be the person who gets the grant for the National Science Foundation for $1.2 million.

1353
01:44:34,968 --> 01:44:37,130
[SPEAKER_11]: And some of her salary is offset

1354
01:44:37,892 --> 01:44:38,513
[SPEAKER_11]: by the grant.

1355
01:44:38,973 --> 01:44:44,359
[SPEAKER_11]: So once again, we take some grant money to pay a portion of the individual's salary.

1356
01:44:44,699 --> 01:44:46,061
[SPEAKER_11]: We list it in the grant section.

1357
01:44:46,341 --> 01:44:47,983
[SPEAKER_11]: We also list her in the regular budget.

1358
01:44:50,305 --> 01:44:57,873
[SPEAKER_11]: And her salary was approved through the negotiations with the Administrators Association in the last round of negotiations that we did.

1359
01:44:58,698 --> 01:44:58,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1360
01:44:59,198 --> 01:45:10,242
[SPEAKER_03]: So could you, I don't, I don't understand why we have a line item that says tri-tech because I thought tri-tech was a nonprofit entity, not through the school district.

1361
01:45:10,322 --> 01:45:12,203
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just surprised to see it.

1362
01:45:12,243 --> 01:45:14,644
[SPEAKER_03]: And I might be dissed that I don't understand it.

1363
01:45:14,684 --> 01:45:15,925
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I'm bringing it up.

1364
01:45:15,985 --> 01:45:23,007
[SPEAKER_11]: So tri-tech is the organization that is a, let's say an offspring of Medford, Malden and Everett.

1365
01:45:23,788 --> 01:45:24,408
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is a,

1366
01:45:25,462 --> 01:45:32,928
[SPEAKER_11]: It was founded initially when the technology park was being developed, was being thought about.

1367
01:45:33,388 --> 01:45:38,333
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's continued for that time and has brought us millions of dollars through different grants over a period of time.

1368
01:45:40,114 --> 01:45:44,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Cindy Fadusha was the original executive director of that particular program.

1369
01:45:44,798 --> 01:45:54,786
[SPEAKER_11]: When she left to take a position with the Harvard Medical School and the physicians group over there, Molly Layden moved up into that position, and Molly Layden

1370
01:45:55,276 --> 01:45:59,277
[SPEAKER_11]: runs that program as well as our program.

1371
01:45:59,677 --> 01:46:10,440
[SPEAKER_11]: But the reality is that the program that she presented the other evening with regard to the youngsters developing applications at the middle school level was funded by the National Science Foundation.

1372
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:15,742
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're allowed to charge a portion of her salary off to that foundation, to that grant.

1373
01:46:16,222 --> 01:46:19,703
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the way we split it out so we can track it properly.

1374
01:46:20,203 --> 01:46:22,964
[SPEAKER_11]: And we audit it properly so that we can report to the feds.

1375
01:46:23,577 --> 01:46:24,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to be clear.

1376
01:46:24,917 --> 01:46:33,300
[SPEAKER_03]: So she's the executive director of Tritech and also an employee of the Method Public.

1377
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:35,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Tritech is the recipient of the grant.

1378
01:46:36,961 --> 01:46:43,063
[SPEAKER_11]: So as a result, Tritech exists as a holding company, if you will, to receive the grant.

1379
01:46:43,203 --> 01:46:47,305
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is the grant that comes in through Tritech, through that 501c3, which allows us to then

1380
01:46:49,199 --> 01:46:51,540
[SPEAKER_11]: rebuild it to this with the University of Lowell.

1381
01:46:51,700 --> 01:46:56,881
[SPEAKER_03]: So the other school departments that are part of TriTech are also paying a portion of her salary?

1382
01:46:57,581 --> 01:47:03,503
[SPEAKER_11]: No, because her portion of her salary, the part that she does for the grant, is paid for by the National Science Foundation.

1383
01:47:03,543 --> 01:47:05,924
[SPEAKER_11]: The rest of it is work she does for us directly.

1384
01:47:10,225 --> 01:47:12,165
[SPEAKER_03]: And then does she get two paychecks?

1385
01:47:12,185 --> 01:47:15,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I didn't believe that you could have two paychecks through the school district.

1386
01:47:16,246 --> 01:47:17,507
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a function.

1387
01:47:17,607 --> 01:47:18,547
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a function of

1388
01:47:19,045 --> 01:47:23,547
[SPEAKER_11]: division of funding, not a function of two positions.

1389
01:47:23,587 --> 01:47:27,709
[SPEAKER_11]: She's a projects director, and the funding source is just like the nurse's position.

1390
01:47:27,729 --> 01:47:29,070
[SPEAKER_11]: It comes from two different sources.

1391
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:29,991
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all.

1392
01:47:30,191 --> 01:47:31,631
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just paid for differently.

1393
01:47:32,012 --> 01:47:34,953
[SPEAKER_11]: If we didn't do that, we would be picking up the tab for lots of grants.

1394
01:47:35,533 --> 01:47:43,898
[SPEAKER_11]: So we use as much offset as we can, and we're allowed to charge to both the federal and the state, in some cases, and this.

1395
01:47:44,438 --> 01:47:46,259
[SPEAKER_11]: The same thing would be true of kindergarten aids.

1396
01:47:46,777 --> 01:47:50,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, which we just did because some of it's going to come from the state and some of it's going to come from us.

1397
01:47:51,379 --> 01:47:54,120
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a normal procedure.

1398
01:47:54,661 --> 01:47:58,842
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one position, but it's a normal procedure funded with two sources.

1399
01:47:59,763 --> 01:48:04,045
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also another position that that's allocated the tri-tech then as well.

1400
01:48:04,445 --> 01:48:05,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Which one is that?

1401
01:48:05,205 --> 01:48:08,827
[SPEAKER_03]: In the one right above it that says, um, director teacher.

1402
01:48:09,347 --> 01:48:13,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me take a look and I'll be a little bit more tuned to that.

1403
01:48:15,155 --> 01:48:15,475
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $64,296.

1404
01:48:15,635 --> 01:48:15,995
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1405
01:48:16,015 --> 01:48:27,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Akira Kamiya is the person who is the primary director and runner of the National Science Foundation grant.

1406
01:48:27,457 --> 01:48:28,838
[SPEAKER_11]: The grant comes to us.

1407
01:48:28,878 --> 01:48:30,438
[SPEAKER_11]: He is located in Medford.

1408
01:48:30,918 --> 01:48:31,958
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's his salary.

1409
01:48:32,438 --> 01:48:35,839
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's paid to us by the grant through the University of Massachusetts at Lowell.

1410
01:48:36,439 --> 01:48:38,459
[SPEAKER_11]: They're our partner in that.

1411
01:48:38,959 --> 01:48:40,120
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's a direct salary.

1412
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:41,700
[SPEAKER_11]: And he works for us and the project.

1413
01:48:42,289 --> 01:48:44,090
[SPEAKER_03]: How much do we get from that grant?

1414
01:48:44,110 --> 01:48:47,633
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I... It's a million two over three years.

1415
01:48:48,553 --> 01:49:01,423
[SPEAKER_11]: And those funds are allocated to these two people's salary and then... These two people's salaries and stipends to teachers working with students for equipment, materials, software, and give you a whole breakdown.

1416
01:49:01,443 --> 01:49:11,650
[SPEAKER_11]: If you go to the grants breakdown on the early part of the book, you'll see what's actually allocated to that grant and how it's broken down on a yearly basis.

1417
01:49:12,158 --> 01:49:20,300
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you go to the front of the book in the section that's given to grants, you will see it.

1418
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:21,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is.

1419
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:24,661
[SPEAKER_11]: It's page, I don't have a page number on it, but I'll.

1420
01:49:26,841 --> 01:49:27,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you see it?

1421
01:49:29,082 --> 01:49:29,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Federal grants.

1422
01:49:32,122 --> 01:49:36,043
[SPEAKER_03]: No, up in the front under the administrative section, I think he's talking about.

1423
01:49:36,103 --> 01:49:36,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

1424
01:49:37,803 --> 01:49:38,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Pat, go ahead.

1425
01:49:38,684 --> 01:49:40,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Tritec is not listed on the grants page.

1426
01:49:41,054 --> 01:49:42,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Not listed on that grant page?

1427
01:49:42,235 --> 01:49:43,675
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a state or federal grant.

1428
01:49:45,436 --> 01:49:45,516
[SPEAKER_11]: OK?

1429
01:49:45,616 --> 01:49:45,676
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1430
01:49:46,037 --> 01:49:46,317
Thank you.

1431
01:49:48,218 --> 01:49:52,580
[SPEAKER_03]: So could we see a breakdown of the TRI grant at some point?

1432
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:52,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1433
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:53,661
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll provide it to you.

1434
01:49:53,761 --> 01:49:54,981
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1435
01:49:55,362 --> 01:49:55,922
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

1436
01:49:56,002 --> 01:49:56,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1437
01:49:56,422 --> 01:50:00,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to learn as I go, because when I see something, I have to ask the question.

1438
01:50:00,644 --> 01:50:01,485
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.

1439
01:50:02,145 --> 01:50:03,326
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that.

1440
01:50:03,586 --> 01:50:06,408
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know I keep asking this.

1441
01:50:10,328 --> 01:50:14,751
[SPEAKER_03]: is will there be any surpluses at the end of this budget?

1442
01:50:14,871 --> 01:50:19,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And if so, when will we get notification of how they'll be of all accounts?

1443
01:50:19,915 --> 01:50:35,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, community schools, everything, all accounts, because this is, and I also would like to, at this point, sorry, to make a motion that when we get our budget book next year, that all accounts that the school committee's responsible for overseeing be presented at this time.

1444
01:50:35,948 --> 01:50:40,413
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way we have everything at once, and it's clear to see it all.

1445
01:50:41,234 --> 01:50:42,095
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to say it again.

1446
01:50:42,696 --> 01:50:49,344
[SPEAKER_11]: In the last two months, we have given you every document on every outside community schools and all these things.

1447
01:50:49,724 --> 01:50:51,406
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can give it to you at the budget time.

1448
01:50:51,666 --> 01:50:52,627
[SPEAKER_11]: You asked for it earlier.

1449
01:50:54,252 --> 01:50:58,074
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm asking, just so that way I can see all entities at the same time.

1450
01:50:58,374 --> 01:51:04,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we vote for the budget, we have all those things, the most updated information so we can vote on it.

1451
01:51:05,258 --> 01:51:12,161
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I'm changing is, you know, maybe we can arrange it so the quarterly report falls at that time.

1452
01:51:12,601 --> 01:51:17,163
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd like to see the after school, the lunch program, all of the programs that I was listing before.

1453
01:51:17,564 --> 01:51:20,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that the school committee oversees at that point.

1454
01:51:20,772 --> 01:51:27,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Any money's going in or out, and any accounts that could have a deficit or a surplus, we should know at this time.

1455
01:51:27,156 --> 01:51:27,596
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

1456
01:51:27,636 --> 01:51:29,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I just would like it in that format.

1457
01:51:29,717 --> 01:51:34,420
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm making a motion for that to happen, and I'm hoping that one of my colleagues will second that.

1458
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:37,942
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll second.

1459
01:51:38,002 --> 01:51:39,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you repeat the motion?

1460
01:51:39,183 --> 01:51:44,846
[SPEAKER_05]: That all the extemporaneous accounts that go to schools, such as the Revolving and the Community Schools accounts, she wants to see the summary with this budget.

1461
01:51:45,607 --> 01:51:46,527
[SPEAKER_05]: But does that mean?

1462
01:51:46,547 --> 01:51:47,708
[SPEAKER_05]: So there would have to be a projection cut.

1463
01:51:49,448 --> 01:51:53,889
[SPEAKER_16]: Does that mean you're not going to be asking for these reports every single week?

1464
01:51:53,969 --> 01:51:56,669
[SPEAKER_16]: No, they're quarterly, and then at budget time.

1465
01:51:57,729 --> 01:52:03,450
[SPEAKER_16]: So we would only be getting them at quarterly time, and then at budget time.

1466
01:52:03,590 --> 01:52:03,930
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

1467
01:52:03,970 --> 01:52:10,132
[SPEAKER_16]: So that means the last two months prior to budget, our administration isn't going to be running around trying to get more reports.

1468
01:52:10,452 --> 01:52:14,352
[SPEAKER_16]: No, we'd have the nine months we're doing here, and then again at the budget time.

1469
01:52:14,772 --> 01:52:16,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of clarification, please.

1470
01:52:17,393 --> 01:52:18,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of clarification?

1471
01:52:19,213 --> 01:52:29,721
[SPEAKER_03]: As a school committee member, if I have a concern at any time, I feel it is my right to ask the superintendent to provide me paperwork to clarify any questions I have.

1472
01:52:30,101 --> 01:52:31,702
[SPEAKER_03]: So it could be at any time.

1473
01:52:32,343 --> 01:52:33,463
[SPEAKER_03]: But, right.

1474
01:52:35,525 --> 01:52:37,006
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to say it very clearly.

1475
01:52:37,466 --> 01:52:37,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1476
01:52:37,786 --> 01:52:39,948
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to make it very clear to everyone here.

1477
01:52:40,528 --> 01:52:45,352
[SPEAKER_11]: A report asked by an individual member is not a report that superintendent responds to.

1478
01:52:46,018 --> 01:52:50,222
[SPEAKER_11]: A report voted by the school committee is a report that the superintendent will respond to.

1479
01:52:50,802 --> 01:52:56,567
[SPEAKER_11]: I cannot and my staff cannot keep doing individual reports every time somebody wants something different.

1480
01:52:57,168 --> 01:52:58,349
[SPEAKER_11]: It takes a lot of time.

1481
01:52:58,389 --> 01:53:03,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Pat worked overtime and overtime to get those reports to you at that point in time.

1482
01:53:03,193 --> 01:53:07,136
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's disingenuous, quite frankly, to keep asking for the same thing.

1483
01:53:07,429 --> 01:53:09,530
[SPEAKER_11]: You want it at budget time next year, you can have it.

1484
01:53:10,171 --> 01:53:12,612
[SPEAKER_11]: The committee voted to get it quarterly, we'll do it.

1485
01:53:12,952 --> 01:53:19,896
[SPEAKER_11]: But let's not keep creating these kinds of report situations, because all it does is take us off what we're trying to do for the education of the kids.

1486
01:53:23,243 --> 01:53:25,664
[SPEAKER_17]: Just to clarify it, that's what I'm trying to find out.

1487
01:53:26,064 --> 01:53:26,844
[SPEAKER_17]: We are a committee.

1488
01:53:27,504 --> 01:53:29,265
[SPEAKER_17]: We all have the right to ask the questions.

1489
01:53:29,305 --> 01:53:30,825
[SPEAKER_17]: We all have the right to be concerned.

1490
01:53:31,145 --> 01:53:32,405
[SPEAKER_17]: But this committee is a committee.

1491
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:37,227
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we're going to be asking for reports, then I think we have to ask them as a committee.

1492
01:53:37,647 --> 01:53:41,168
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think it could just be done every single time someone decides to ask.

1493
01:53:41,188 --> 01:53:41,428
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1494
01:53:43,098 --> 01:53:45,179
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's what I want to make sure.

1495
01:53:45,199 --> 01:53:53,121
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to make sure that if we're going to be working on a budget next year, I want to make sure that the administration is putting in their time, making sure that we all get the information.

1496
01:53:56,042 --> 01:54:06,706
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would make more sense if the fourth quarter, is it the third quarter, would be part, would be the budget report.

1497
01:54:06,766 --> 01:54:11,848
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're not preparing five, you're doing quarterly reports, and one of them is with the budget.

1498
01:54:17,486 --> 01:54:18,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I see, okay.

1499
01:54:20,509 --> 01:54:22,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you.

1500
01:54:23,752 --> 01:54:34,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and it's more, to clarify what I want, it's more accurate towards the end of the year, what's left in those accounts, what's not left, if we need to allocate more funding to that,

1501
01:54:35,435 --> 01:54:47,262
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, we can use more funds for next year.

1502
01:54:49,643 --> 01:54:53,165
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other thing you need to keep in mind is just what we're talking about state and federal grants.

1503
01:54:53,205 --> 01:54:54,646
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have the allocations yet.

1504
01:54:55,627 --> 01:54:58,768
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can't tell you what that account is going to look like going forward.

1505
01:54:58,788 --> 01:55:03,331
[SPEAKER_11]: I can only tell you what it's been in a given year because the state budget isn't even approved yet.

1506
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:07,622
[SPEAKER_11]: And the federal budget won't get delivered to us until the summer.

1507
01:55:08,702 --> 01:55:11,864
[SPEAKER_11]: And all that stuff has something to do with the way we allocate money.

1508
01:55:12,384 --> 01:55:18,247
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to use projections all year long to see what's coming in and to balance one account off against the other.

1509
01:55:18,907 --> 01:55:20,588
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yes, we can give you projections.

1510
01:55:20,628 --> 01:55:28,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we can give you, you know, revolving accounts at a point in time, as a snapshot in time, like the end of the third quarter going into budget, which would be typical.

1511
01:55:29,032 --> 01:55:33,474
[SPEAKER_11]: But to give you a projection, what's going to be true in August are going to be true in September.

1512
01:55:33,964 --> 01:55:35,064
[SPEAKER_11]: is all speculation.

1513
01:55:37,225 --> 01:55:37,405
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1514
01:55:37,565 --> 01:55:42,746
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a public hearing.

1515
01:55:43,087 --> 01:55:45,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll now open it up to the general public.

1516
01:55:45,147 --> 01:55:46,187
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a public hearing.

1517
01:55:46,247 --> 01:55:53,930
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have any comments on the budget that was presented Wednesday as adjusted this evening through the reports of the superintendent, please come forward.

1518
01:55:56,990 --> 01:55:57,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address, please.

1519
01:55:59,011 --> 01:55:59,851
[SPEAKER_15]: Maria Skippington.

1520
01:55:59,871 --> 01:56:02,812
[SPEAKER_15]: We're from Roberts Elementary, 74 Autumn Street, Malden.

1521
01:56:03,511 --> 01:56:20,224
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to, not asking you for anything else, I just wanted to, we wanted to thank Mr. Belson, Madam Mayor, and the school committee for hearing us and for supporting us with something that we really felt was a very important initiative, so thank you.

1522
01:56:23,487 --> 01:56:27,830
[SPEAKER_12]: Amanda Gass, Roberts Elementary, 101 Aberdeen, Cambridge.

1523
01:56:28,871 --> 01:56:30,953
[SPEAKER_12]: I second Maria's sentiment and

1524
01:56:31,448 --> 01:56:32,989
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much for hearing us.

1525
01:56:33,049 --> 01:56:35,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Many of you came and visited our classrooms.

1526
01:56:36,430 --> 01:56:38,211
[SPEAKER_12]: We really appreciate the support.

1527
01:56:39,252 --> 01:56:41,473
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to ask a clarifying question.

1528
01:56:43,213 --> 01:56:49,276
[SPEAKER_12]: So are the full-time aides for the Roberts dependent on the state budget, or are they guaranteed?

1529
01:56:49,296 --> 01:56:51,597
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my first.

1530
01:56:51,657 --> 01:56:52,638
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we put them in the budget.

1531
01:56:52,918 --> 01:56:53,198
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

1532
01:56:53,978 --> 01:56:58,640
[SPEAKER_12]: And my second question was the original proposal that we saw last week.

1533
01:57:00,844 --> 01:57:05,968
[SPEAKER_12]: There were district-wide, and I'm sorry, I am asking for other things.

1534
01:57:06,289 --> 01:57:10,152
[SPEAKER_12]: There were district-wide full-time K-AIDS dependent on the state budget.

1535
01:57:10,212 --> 01:57:12,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that still in place, or are those gone?

1536
01:57:13,095 --> 01:57:16,938
[SPEAKER_11]: There are three additional full-time AIDS at the Roberts.

1537
01:57:17,378 --> 01:57:18,199
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the addition.

1538
01:57:20,481 --> 01:57:21,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything else stays in place.

1539
01:57:21,782 --> 01:57:22,443
[SPEAKER_12]: Stays in place.

1540
01:57:22,503 --> 01:57:28,068
[SPEAKER_12]: So if the state budget comes through with the kindergarten grant, you're still matching it

1541
01:57:28,812 --> 01:57:30,697
[SPEAKER_12]: fund full-time aides for the rest of the school?

1542
01:57:30,717 --> 01:57:31,719
[SPEAKER_11]: At this point in time, no.

1543
01:57:33,123 --> 01:57:33,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Just the Roberts.

1544
01:57:34,025 --> 01:57:34,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Just the Roberts.

1545
01:57:38,484 --> 01:57:39,705
[SPEAKER_17]: If you were still there, I'm sorry.

1546
01:57:40,085 --> 01:57:45,768
[SPEAKER_17]: If you were still there is that we felt that it was important to listen to also the principals of each and every individual school.

1547
01:57:46,569 --> 01:57:58,276
[SPEAKER_17]: So when we heard their requests and what they were really looking for, even though we were all going to look for the full-time aides, we were also told that there were different things in their schools that they needed.

1548
01:57:58,656 --> 01:58:05,760
[SPEAKER_17]: With that being said, we've also made it very clear this evening that we want to make sure that down the road and in our next budget year,

1549
01:58:06,382 --> 01:58:12,325
[SPEAKER_17]: If we're going to be doing this, we want to make sure that it is our wish as a committee to have that across the board.

1550
01:58:13,105 --> 01:58:13,345
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1551
01:58:13,566 --> 01:58:18,208
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would like to welcome you into our classrooms for next year.

1552
01:58:18,228 --> 01:58:19,248
[SPEAKER_12]: Anytime I can.

1553
01:58:19,448 --> 01:58:29,273
[SPEAKER_12]: To see, you know, we have a very diverse population and the aides are an integral part in differentiating instruction for that.

1554
01:58:29,393 --> 01:58:34,096
[SPEAKER_12]: But that being said, I would also encourage you to reach out to

1555
01:58:35,418 --> 01:58:58,503
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know some K teachers have reached out to you at the other schools, because while we are the only level three school in the district, and we do need this, absolutely, and I am a proponent for our school, I also can't in good conscience say that this is not a district-wide issue, and you should go and visit other classrooms as well.

1556
01:58:59,890 --> 01:59:04,731
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I thank you for your support for this issue across the district.

1557
01:59:04,751 --> 01:59:05,072
[SPEAKER_05]: This is fun.

1558
01:59:05,112 --> 01:59:05,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks very much.

1559
01:59:05,772 --> 01:59:06,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1560
01:59:06,172 --> 01:59:07,472
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a motion.

1561
01:59:27,545 --> 01:59:31,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anyone else that would like to speak in support or in opposition to the budget this evening?

1562
01:59:33,188 --> 01:59:35,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearing saying none, we'll move that motion to the hearing.

1563
01:59:35,349 --> 01:59:37,210
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a motion on the floor earlier by Ms.

1564
01:59:37,270 --> 01:59:40,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Vanden Heuvel for approval of the budget, seconded by Ms.

1565
01:59:41,052 --> 01:59:41,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Cuno.

1566
01:59:41,952 --> 01:59:43,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote, Mr. Skerry.

1567
01:59:43,253 --> 01:59:43,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1568
01:59:43,553 --> 01:59:44,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Cuno.

1569
01:59:44,314 --> 01:59:44,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1570
01:59:44,714 --> 01:59:44,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1571
01:59:44,934 --> 01:59:45,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Vanden Heuvel.

1572
01:59:45,574 --> 01:59:45,714
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1573
01:59:45,754 --> 01:59:46,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1574
01:59:46,415 --> 01:59:46,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Kretz.

1575
01:59:48,776 --> 01:59:49,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1576
01:59:49,056 --> 01:59:49,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Kretz.

1577
01:59:49,576 --> 01:59:51,517
[SPEAKER_05]: On the budget.

1578
01:59:52,578 --> 01:59:53,118
[SPEAKER_05]: The budget.

1579
01:59:53,158 --> 01:59:54,039
[SPEAKER_11]: To approve the budget.

1580
02:00:09,479 --> 02:00:12,119
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want to make another statement about something.

1581
02:00:12,959 --> 02:00:14,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Tomorrow night, I go to the city council.

1582
02:00:16,300 --> 02:00:18,200
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the school committee budget.

1583
02:00:19,501 --> 02:00:26,062
[SPEAKER_11]: I expect that the school committee supports its own budget because when I go to that

1584
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:39,546
[SPEAKER_11]: council, I don't want to go in there and find that the budget that the school committee voted is not approved and not supported by the school committee.

1585
02:00:40,066 --> 02:00:41,447
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want to make that very clear.

1586
02:00:41,487 --> 02:00:42,307
[SPEAKER_11]: That's very strong.

1587
02:00:42,347 --> 02:00:48,250
[SPEAKER_11]: In my opinion, you vote as a committee, you stand as a committee, the superintendent represents you as a committee.

1588
02:00:52,500 --> 02:01:02,804
[SPEAKER_09]: So given the adjustments that were made, I'm not quite sure why my colleagues now have voted against it, the two that did.

1589
02:01:02,864 --> 02:01:09,087
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, too, was looking for unity because that is what we want to go into and support.

1590
02:01:11,108 --> 02:01:18,551
[SPEAKER_09]: I do understand that people might have preferences, and I'm sure, for example, that many of my colleagues would, in fact, like to have

1591
02:01:19,007 --> 02:01:23,150
[SPEAKER_09]: said we're going to do kindergarten aides across the city all at once.

1592
02:01:24,852 --> 02:01:30,576
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a very large budget with many other things, very important things to us.

1593
02:01:30,816 --> 02:01:32,297
[SPEAKER_09]: We've added an English teacher.

1594
02:01:32,838 --> 02:01:36,781
[SPEAKER_09]: We've added lots of different elements.

1595
02:01:39,283 --> 02:01:46,528
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that the committee has spoken and said, yes, there is a desire in the future to add that we're starting out with the Roberts.

1596
02:01:46,608 --> 02:01:47,689
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a level three school.

1597
02:01:49,123 --> 02:01:52,147
[SPEAKER_09]: justification for why we're starting in this particular school.

1598
02:01:52,848 --> 02:02:06,244
[SPEAKER_09]: I hasten to remind everybody that when we get to kindergarten aids, the money, the dollars seem short, but the obligation of the city in terms of the additional finances for healthcare are significant.

1599
02:02:07,354 --> 02:02:24,141
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that the beginnings of this budget and on that particular issue have been addressed, and it's clearly been heard that there is a desire to increase as we go on.

1600
02:02:27,682 --> 02:02:31,044
[SPEAKER_09]: So I share with the superintendent frustration.

1601
02:02:31,064 --> 02:02:33,505
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the other night,

1602
02:02:35,111 --> 02:02:49,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I had hoped to have a unified budget, and there were some levels of consternation because there were so many things that weren't clear, and tonight we've now clarified those in, I think, a very, very positive manner.

1603
02:02:53,740 --> 02:03:15,848
[SPEAKER_09]: I for one would ask my colleagues to reconsider their vote, and I would like to have a discussion and see, because I'm not quite sure if that's the only issue that's outstanding, and I'm not understanding something else for that negative vote by my colleagues, that I would urge you to reconsider, because a budget is a huge

1604
02:03:18,108 --> 02:03:21,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Entity, it is not a one issue question.

1605
02:03:22,211 --> 02:03:28,756
[SPEAKER_09]: We are here for the good of all of our students, whether they're in kindergarten or whether they're in a high school senior.

1606
02:03:29,697 --> 02:03:30,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Every student is important.

1607
02:03:31,558 --> 02:03:44,108
[SPEAKER_09]: And to hold up that unity on a budget because of one issue, especially when so much progress has been made, I believe is not in the best interest of the public schools and the children and families we serve.

1608
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:59,063
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my it's my first, you know, meeting being on the school committee listening to the budget.

1609
02:03:59,563 --> 02:04:00,884
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat in last year.

1610
02:04:00,904 --> 02:04:07,208
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just really confused why why it wasn't agreed by my two colleagues.

1611
02:04:07,228 --> 02:04:16,973
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'd like to hear more on why they disagree with the budget, because I I mean, I felt the revisions were everything that was asked for.

1612
02:04:17,620 --> 02:04:27,389
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm confused why, I guess I'm just confused why it wasn't approved now, you know, because that's what we agreed on and then the add-ins were added.

1613
02:04:27,930 --> 02:04:33,695
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I would like to know a little bit more as to why there's a, they're not approving it.

1614
02:04:34,156 --> 02:04:35,097
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's my question.

1615
02:04:37,293 --> 02:04:39,357
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree with my two colleagues that have just spoken.

1616
02:04:39,477 --> 02:04:47,330
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, we sat the other night and we dissected everything that we wanted to dissect, and we went item by item.

1617
02:04:48,051 --> 02:04:50,034
[SPEAKER_17]: And at the end of the night, I know that

1618
02:04:51,137 --> 02:04:54,380
[SPEAKER_17]: It was in the minutes I had asked, is this the list that we're all looking for?

1619
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:56,321
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we looking for the kindergarten aides?

1620
02:04:56,722 --> 02:04:58,163
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we looking for math coaches?

1621
02:04:58,183 --> 02:04:59,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we looking in everything?

1622
02:05:00,004 --> 02:05:07,470
[SPEAKER_17]: And when we left there that evening, we said we wanted, it would have been good, or we would like to have the kindergarten aides across the board.

1623
02:05:07,850 --> 02:05:14,055
[SPEAKER_17]: But we also took out of respect for the principals that came up and spoke to us what their wish list was.

1624
02:05:14,435 --> 02:05:17,057
[SPEAKER_17]: Did they say that they didn't want kindergarten aides?

1625
02:05:17,197 --> 02:05:17,838
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely not.

1626
02:05:18,158 --> 02:05:26,844
[SPEAKER_17]: But they also said, if push comes to shove, and I really need something that I need and truly need in my school at this moment, they told us what they wanted.

1627
02:05:27,284 --> 02:05:27,985
[SPEAKER_17]: We sat there.

1628
02:05:28,025 --> 02:05:29,666
[SPEAKER_17]: We tried to make everyone happy.

1629
02:05:29,706 --> 02:05:37,431
[SPEAKER_17]: We even left before the meeting was over saying that if we decided to do it this year for the Roberts, it was out of consideration.

1630
02:05:37,571 --> 02:05:46,477
[SPEAKER_17]: It is something that they've been asking for for the last couple of years, that they are a Title I school because of the situation of where they landed, you know, a couple of points off.

1631
02:05:46,897 --> 02:05:47,378
[SPEAKER_17]: And we said,

1632
02:05:47,978 --> 02:06:01,883
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, and we knew, I mean, that evening, it's, again, on the minutes, on the tape, we knew that the second we were going to do this, we were going to have other schools say to us, hey, don't forget about us, we want the kindergarten needs, too.

1633
02:06:02,383 --> 02:06:04,604
[SPEAKER_17]: It's something that we've said across the board.

1634
02:06:04,644 --> 02:06:06,045
[SPEAKER_17]: We even said it this evening.

1635
02:06:06,065 --> 02:06:07,885
[SPEAKER_17]: I said it this evening before we even voted.

1636
02:06:08,286 --> 02:06:15,428
[SPEAKER_17]: We have not forgotten about the other schools, but we want to make sure that we also listen and hear, we're not the people in those schools.

1637
02:06:15,768 --> 02:06:16,749
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not there every day.

1638
02:06:17,624 --> 02:06:21,805
[SPEAKER_17]: And we need to have some type of respect and communication with the people that are there.

1639
02:06:22,385 --> 02:06:31,087
[SPEAKER_17]: So going to the city council in this type of vote, to me, just shows that we are not a unity.

1640
02:06:31,388 --> 02:06:32,928
[SPEAKER_17]: We are not working as a committee.

1641
02:06:33,508 --> 02:06:40,170
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's a shame, because I don't know about anybody else, but whether we approved, disapproved, whether we agreed or disagreed,

1642
02:06:41,337 --> 02:06:50,725
[SPEAKER_17]: with previous or even with our own committee here, by the end of the day, it wasn't about being in camera, it wasn't about politics, it wasn't about anyone.

1643
02:06:51,245 --> 02:06:53,247
[SPEAKER_17]: It was about what this district needed.

1644
02:06:54,328 --> 02:07:09,260
[SPEAKER_17]: And honestly, I'm really confused because I thought the superintendent has done a great job with the financial director in getting us what we can at this point, especially when we're looking at a budget from the state that we don't even know what we're going to have.

1645
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:15,042
[SPEAKER_17]: And do we want to be in a situation right now that we're going to say, sure, we'll give everyone kindergarten eds.

1646
02:07:15,082 --> 02:07:16,763
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll give everybody everything they want.

1647
02:07:17,123 --> 02:07:25,247
[SPEAKER_17]: And then come October, when we don't have the money, and all of a sudden, we're giving half of our faculty pink slips because we're not going to have teachers in the system.

1648
02:07:26,027 --> 02:07:27,508
[SPEAKER_17]: These are things we need to look at.

1649
02:07:28,289 --> 02:07:29,829
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, yes, am I frustrated?

1650
02:07:30,490 --> 02:07:31,190
[SPEAKER_17]: Very much so.

1651
02:07:31,210 --> 02:07:34,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1652
02:07:34,071 --> 02:07:34,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1653
02:07:37,653 --> 02:07:37,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Martin.

1654
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:38,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1655
02:07:39,321 --> 02:07:40,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

1656
02:07:40,501 --> 02:07:41,662
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was going to keep my mouth shut.

1657
02:07:41,722 --> 02:07:42,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I really was.

1658
02:07:44,204 --> 02:07:48,487
[SPEAKER_06]: The council does vote, and they don't always agree either, OK?

1659
02:07:48,507 --> 02:07:50,829
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a two to five split vote.

1660
02:07:51,329 --> 02:07:52,029
[SPEAKER_06]: They can do that.

1661
02:07:52,169 --> 02:07:52,910
[SPEAKER_06]: That's their right.

1662
02:07:53,771 --> 02:08:02,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I do respect the councilors who vote in the minority who explain why they vote in the minority.

1663
02:08:03,617 --> 02:08:06,119
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is their right to vote into the minority.

1664
02:08:06,619 --> 02:08:07,380
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's their right.

1665
02:08:07,902 --> 02:08:09,683
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the same way with the Supreme Court.

1666
02:08:10,184 --> 02:08:11,585
[SPEAKER_06]: They have split votes, too.

1667
02:08:12,085 --> 02:08:18,891
[SPEAKER_06]: So I understand that you want to go in with the United Front, but it's not obligated.

1668
02:08:18,951 --> 02:08:19,771
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not obligated.

1669
02:08:19,811 --> 02:08:21,192
[SPEAKER_06]: They can have a minority vote.

1670
02:08:21,853 --> 02:08:23,374
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to put that out there.

1671
02:08:25,075 --> 02:08:26,617
[SPEAKER_06]: And you will be respected more.

1672
02:08:27,912 --> 02:08:30,153
[SPEAKER_06]: if you explain why, I agree with you.

1673
02:08:30,613 --> 02:08:41,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Because those that explain why they vote in the minority, when I'm at home, or actually not home, I'm here all the time, but when I listen to it, I have respect for that person because they gave me the explanation.

1674
02:08:41,936 --> 02:08:42,956
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to say that.

1675
02:08:43,396 --> 02:08:56,160
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, but, so, well, just to add to that, you don't have to put pressure on the people that voted in the minority

1676
02:08:56,725 --> 02:08:59,587
[SPEAKER_06]: If that's their choice, they don't have to explain it either.

1677
02:09:00,408 --> 02:09:01,109
[SPEAKER_06]: That's their choice.

1678
02:09:01,249 --> 02:09:05,472
[SPEAKER_06]: But they will be perceived as having an ulterior motive if they don't explain it.

1679
02:09:06,873 --> 02:09:07,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1680
02:09:08,474 --> 02:09:12,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Mayor, I wouldn't want anyone to think that we couldn't vote, certainly as we did.

1681
02:09:13,939 --> 02:09:16,661
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just that, quite honestly, I was surprised.

1682
02:09:17,041 --> 02:09:23,126
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to make it clear, by the way, that there have been years where I have voted against the budget because I was concerned

1683
02:09:23,919 --> 02:09:30,543
[SPEAKER_09]: that the entire budget level was short, and that we were not meeting the needs of our students.

1684
02:09:30,623 --> 02:09:37,988
[SPEAKER_09]: So please understand that it's not, that I've never, that I've always been in agreement with the bottom line, but that's really the issue.

1685
02:09:38,068 --> 02:09:40,209
[SPEAKER_09]: In some ways, it's the ultimate bottom line.

1686
02:09:40,870 --> 02:09:44,632
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't understand why my colleagues voted against it, and that's why I said what I said.

1687
02:09:45,372 --> 02:09:52,156
[SPEAKER_09]: I am wondering, since the superintendent has made a statement sort of saying, geez, I'd rather go in with a unified force,

1688
02:09:54,777 --> 02:10:07,491
[SPEAKER_09]: whether there was a point in my asking for reconsideration so that we could vote it again if any colleague had a feeling that they were persuaded for some sense of unity.

1689
02:10:07,872 --> 02:10:13,298
[SPEAKER_09]: But if there's not, then I respect your votes, and I'm not going to bother for a reconsideration.

1690
02:10:13,621 --> 02:10:22,889
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was just trying to sort of feel out whether either of my colleagues who voted against the budget wanted to reconsider their thoughts.

1691
02:10:28,953 --> 02:10:29,494
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're willing.

1692
02:10:30,575 --> 02:10:31,355
[SPEAKER_08]: But you don't have to.

1693
02:10:32,997 --> 02:10:43,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much, I think everyone knows, during the campaign I held two town meetings at the library and at the South Bedford Fire Station community room.

1694
02:10:43,784 --> 02:10:51,990
[SPEAKER_08]: There were parents from McGlynn and the Roberts and the Columbus that all spoke about the need for kindergarten aides.

1695
02:10:52,130 --> 02:10:55,272
[SPEAKER_08]: I have said it throughout this year that it's district-wide.

1696
02:10:55,312 --> 02:10:55,793
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a need.

1697
02:10:55,893 --> 02:11:03,819
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand the principals have their own priorities, but I think I'm here for the parents and the students, and that priority is for district-wide kindergarten aides.

1698
02:11:03,859 --> 02:11:04,719
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why I'm not.

1699
02:11:05,240 --> 02:11:08,122
[SPEAKER_08]: And you somehow managed to find $500,000 in five days.

1700
02:11:08,142 --> 02:11:08,562
[SPEAKER_08]: I have, I guess, this.

1701
02:11:08,582 --> 02:11:09,503
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't five days.

1702
02:11:13,710 --> 02:11:21,153
[SPEAKER_08]: 200, whatever it added up to, then I have faith that you can find more.

1703
02:11:22,834 --> 02:11:26,416
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Madam Mayor, can I just want to say one thing.

1704
02:11:26,476 --> 02:11:31,678
[SPEAKER_11]: My comment was not that people can't vote against the budget.

1705
02:11:32,938 --> 02:11:33,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Majority rules.

1706
02:11:33,759 --> 02:11:34,159
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 5-2.

1707
02:11:34,479 --> 02:11:36,400
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a vote for the budget.

1708
02:11:36,700 --> 02:11:37,060
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fine.

1709
02:11:37,100 --> 02:11:43,303
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been in enough meetings in the course of my career to know that they don't always get a unanimous vote for things.

1710
02:11:43,812 --> 02:11:44,753
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's not the issue.

1711
02:11:45,694 --> 02:11:54,702
[SPEAKER_11]: The issue I raised is when I go to the council tomorrow night, I want the committee to honor the fact that the committee voted.

1712
02:11:55,182 --> 02:12:03,010
[SPEAKER_11]: And I said that before, when I was talking about reports, I don't want to go to the council and find that individual members go there and argue against the budget.

1713
02:12:03,810 --> 02:12:08,835
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm saying, because the budget is what this committee voted up or down.

1714
02:12:10,022 --> 02:12:11,923
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a committee, you're not individuals.

1715
02:12:11,943 --> 02:12:15,686
[SPEAKER_11]: You've been told many times that as an individual you have no authority.

1716
02:12:16,407 --> 02:12:21,971
[SPEAKER_11]: It's only when you're in session and as a group that you have authority to act on behalf of the city and the school system.

1717
02:12:22,871 --> 02:12:37,101
[SPEAKER_11]: And so all I'm trying to do is make it clear that I don't want to go in there with a divided camp tomorrow night and find that people will argue against me from my own committee because you voted this budget by majority.

1718
02:12:38,002 --> 02:12:39,123
[SPEAKER_11]: And you could have voted the other way.

1719
02:12:39,901 --> 02:12:41,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Or you could have voted for anything else you wanted.

1720
02:12:42,863 --> 02:12:43,603
[SPEAKER_11]: But you voted it.

1721
02:12:44,544 --> 02:12:50,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Up or down, whether you're on the majority side or the minority side, it is the school committee budget.

1722
02:12:50,708 --> 02:12:53,090
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what the superintendent will represent tomorrow night.

1723
02:12:53,210 --> 02:12:58,533
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I'm asked about other people's opinions, I will say the school committee voted this budget.

1724
02:12:59,614 --> 02:13:00,514
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to make that clear.

1725
02:13:00,555 --> 02:13:01,635
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I said what I said.

1726
02:13:02,496 --> 02:13:03,697
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have a problem with dissent.

1727
02:13:03,777 --> 02:13:05,218
[SPEAKER_11]: People want to dissent, that's business.

1728
02:13:05,518 --> 02:13:06,759
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand that.

1729
02:13:09,064 --> 02:13:09,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1730
02:13:10,586 --> 02:13:16,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I respect your asking me, but throughout this evening I've raised concerns that I've had with this budget.

1731
02:13:16,732 --> 02:13:25,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I think direct services to children are my main priority, and I saw areas that allocations could be made towards that that weren't.

1732
02:13:25,602 --> 02:13:27,204
[SPEAKER_03]: And based on what I

1733
02:13:28,635 --> 02:13:35,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to vote what I feel is best, both for myself and for the students within our community.

1734
02:13:36,260 --> 02:13:50,929
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do understand your want and need for us to be all together, but just because I don't vote in the exact same way with you doesn't mean that I don't respect your decision and why you vote, and I hope you feel the same way with mine.

1735
02:13:51,433 --> 02:13:53,254
[SPEAKER_03]: and as well as my other committee members.

1736
02:13:54,655 --> 02:14:03,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly really think about these choices and I know that we usually do a whole committee votes yes on the budget and moves forward.

1737
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:12,285
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know this is different for me personally as a committee member, but this is what I feel is necessary for me to vote.

1738
02:14:12,709 --> 02:14:15,770
[SPEAKER_03]: at this time, and I've given multiple reasons.

1739
02:14:15,870 --> 02:14:18,370
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want me to go over them all again, I can.

1740
02:14:20,010 --> 02:14:21,851
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm sure you don't.

1741
02:14:23,391 --> 02:14:25,832
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, you want me to give you the list?

1742
02:14:26,392 --> 02:14:28,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Three paraprofessionals.

1743
02:14:28,452 --> 02:14:30,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Erin, you do not need to do that.

1744
02:14:31,173 --> 02:14:32,033
[SPEAKER_03]: To my colleagues.

1745
02:14:35,334 --> 02:14:37,474
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

1746
02:14:37,654 --> 02:14:39,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Three members asked me to explain why.

1747
02:14:39,955 --> 02:14:42,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really feel like I do that throughout the meeting.

1748
02:14:42,641 --> 02:14:46,263
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't mean to be any disrespect.

1749
02:14:46,343 --> 02:14:49,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I do appreciate the things that were added back in.

1750
02:14:49,545 --> 02:14:57,170
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really thank the superintendent and his staff for going back and reallocating funds so that way we were able to add things tonight.

1751
02:14:57,908 --> 02:15:03,331
[SPEAKER_03]: But my vote is my vote, and I feel like it's what I have, and that's what I've done.

1752
02:15:03,692 --> 02:15:15,599
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Madam Mayor, just to conclude the discussion, then, I certainly want to express to my two colleagues that I appreciate their due diligence, and I respect their votes, even if I disagree with it and would have preferred it a different way.

1753
02:15:16,019 --> 02:15:26,486
[SPEAKER_09]: However, even though, Erin, you've asked many questions, and I can know some of your areas of concern, I still was surprised, because I thought we were more on the same page.

1754
02:15:26,806 --> 02:15:33,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that you've articulated exactly where you're coming from, I appreciate it, I understand it, and I now understand the vote better.

1755
02:15:34,439 --> 02:15:38,305
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you and we'll, if we could, did we call the vote?

1756
02:15:38,385 --> 02:15:38,545
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1757
02:15:38,826 --> 02:15:39,607
[SPEAKER_17]: We already called the vote.

1758
02:15:39,627 --> 02:15:40,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Called the vote.

1759
02:15:44,290 --> 02:15:49,397
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to say, everyone has the right to do what they want to vote, and it wasn't about the vote.

1760
02:15:49,878 --> 02:15:52,661
[SPEAKER_17]: It was about the clarification of where we came from the other night.

1761
02:15:53,462 --> 02:15:58,529
[SPEAKER_17]: If we had discussed and there were members that were concerned about, I'm not going to approve this.

1762
02:15:59,190 --> 02:16:05,337
[SPEAKER_17]: without having kindergarten across the board, at least we would have known a little bit better of where we stood tonight.

1763
02:16:05,757 --> 02:16:10,022
[SPEAKER_17]: If we had members that were concerned, and I'm not putting down anyone's concern.

1764
02:16:10,102 --> 02:16:11,323
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone has the right to concern.

1765
02:16:11,363 --> 02:16:18,551
[SPEAKER_17]: But as a committee, when we discussed it the other night, and that's why the surprise tonight, if I had known that I was going to come in here,

1766
02:16:19,292 --> 02:16:29,114
[SPEAKER_17]: saying that this budget wasn't going to be, you know, I even think the superintendent would have known if he had known saying, nope, no kindergarten aides, we're not going to pass it.

1767
02:16:29,134 --> 02:16:33,716
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we would have at least had a little bit of an awareness.

1768
02:16:34,396 --> 02:16:34,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1769
02:16:36,356 --> 02:16:36,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1770
02:16:38,217 --> 02:16:38,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1771
02:16:38,817 --> 02:16:40,037
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was the reason.

1772
02:16:41,757 --> 02:16:42,138
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fine.

1773
02:16:47,939 --> 02:16:48,900
[SPEAKER_05]: We may come up.

1774
02:16:48,960 --> 02:16:49,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1775
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:51,182
[SPEAKER_05]: We may come back up if you take votes.
