    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00112&t=213.293s">[Danielle Balocca]</a>: Dwa, li sezi m 'ke mwen tande podcast ou ak wè dokimantè a ke yo te yon bagay dedye li te kap chèche zanmi anfans li.
 Lè sa a, mwen pa vle bay twòp, men ou ta renmen di nou yon bagay sou podcast ou a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00112&t=227.922s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  Yeah, sure.
 So I grew up in Lawrence, Massachusetts, which at the time was the 23rd poorest city in the country.
 I'm sure it's not much higher at this point or lower, however you look at it.
 the demographics are really marginalized population.
 And of marginalized populations, the most marginalized are individuals like children or people with disabilities, right?
 So we were children in this community that was already pretty marginalized growing up in a, what we called at the time, you know, projects, housing projects.
 And some of the words, just to be clear that I'm gonna use
 are very specific to the 1970s.
 And I'll explain why that's important, but I'll also maybe use the contemporary word as well.
 But when you don't understand the word and you don't have a lexicon, it kind of makes things more ambiguous.
 And so that'll come up a little bit in this, and you'll see why.
 But Andy and I grew up in a housing project in Lawrence.
 And he moved in the March before he disappeared.
 He disappeared in August of 1976.
 And a few years earlier, we had had a municipal pool built right across the street from the stadium projects.
 And so that was a huge bonus for us.
 We thought that was the best thing ever.
 And it was pretty much like our vacation.
 A lot of us didn't get to take vacations.
 And so we were at the
 at the municipal pool every day.
 And it was, it was a gift really.
 It was great, great program, great project.
 And Andy's house, you could see the pool from his front door.
 I mean, he was that close and the units were all like, they were six unit dwellings, like one building with six units in it straight across.
 And we just all really knew each other.
 We're a community.
 And I like to say that for the kids, it was part stand by me and part Lord of the Flies.
 So people who know those movies and those books might get it.
 It sort of was, you know, nobody messes with us.
 We take care of each other.
 We have each other's backs, but also amongst each other, it was survival of the fittest, right?
 Like we also had a pecking order.
 But anyway, Andy moved in that March and he was my brother's friend, you know, initially.
 And then he and I, the first time I met, he was outside playing football.
 with my brother and I asked if I could play.
 And I'm the only girl with three older brothers and I was often being chewed away as a pest.
 And they didn't want, he didn't, my brother didn't want me to play.
 And Andy stopped the game and said that he wouldn't play unless I could play too, which I thought was super sweet.
 And I developed kind of an instant crush and he was already pretty cute.
 You know, he had like olive skin and just big brown eyes.
 And he had like his hair is kind of,
 over one of his eyes, floppy hair over one of his eyes and he'd like flip his head back to get it out of his eyes when he was talking to you.
 And he was just, it was like that prepubescent crush that we have, I guess.
 And so we started to become friends and we hung out even without my brother around and
 little things like, you know, he was always taking care of his siblings.
 He was the oldest of five and he was very paternal in the family.
 His mom was a single mom.
 And so Andy would do a lot of the childcare.
 And I remember one time he was handing cookies out to his siblings and
 after he had handed them all out to me.
 And he came back to me and offered me another cookie, which just like little things that kids do to show you that they like you.
 And he had gotten some walkie talkies right before he disappeared.
 His birthday was coming up.
 He disappeared just a week and a half before his 11th birthday.
 And we went to the pool that Sunday.
 I remember it was just super hot.
 Sunday in August before school was gonna start.
 It was one of the last Sundays before school would start.
 And we went to the pool and we had been hanging out and just swimming and swimming.
 And we're kids with a lot of energy.
 So we just would swim every chance we got and they would have breaks occasionally to just make us rest.
 And so they had a 10 minute whistle break or whatever.
 And we were all sitting together outside of the locker room and my brothers and his friend and Andy and me,
 And I just had this feeling that day that then I didn't know what it was, but today I do.
 It was intuition.
 And I didn't want to walk home alone.
 And I asked Andy if he would walk home with me.
 And he said he didn't want to.
 He was going to stay at the pool longer.
 And I asked my brother if he would walk home with me.
 And he said he didn't want to.
 And I turned on my heel and said I was going to tell on him.
 and walked out of the pool and my brother ended up deciding it would be better for him to walk me home.
 So he sort of jumped up and walked out with me.
 And literally all it took was crossing the street, crossing a little tiny project parking lot.
 going past Andy's house and down a little tiny hill and my house was right there.
 My grandmother's was right there.
 I mean, we were so close to the pool.
 And so my brother and I went home and it was around late afternoon lunchtime.
 We were hungry.
 That's the reason that I wanted to go home.
 And I had intended to come back to the pool, which I would normally do, but I think after,
 The whole morning I was tired, I didn't go back to the pool.
 And sometime later, around five-ish or so, you know, people started asking, you know, if Andy's mother was looking for him because, you know, it was the free-range kid days, right?
 You could go wherever all day long and nobody knew where the heck you were, but when it came to dinner time, you had to be home and that was just the rule.
 And so it was dinnertime and Andy wasn't home.
 And so, you know, we sort of heard whispers like, oh, Andy's in trouble.
 You know, we didn't really think much of it.
 And then, you know, went to sleep that night like any other night and ended up being woken up in the middle of the night, early morning hours with the police banging on the front door.
 And my mother brought my brother, Jeff and I down to the kitchen table and they were asking us if we had been with Andy, when was the last time we had seen him?
 And then it became real.
 And the next day, probably later that day, Monday or maybe Tuesday, a search team was set up.
 They set up like a CB radio trucker, 18 wheeler thing over at the stadium parking lot.
 The football stadium was right next to the project.
 It was named after the stadium project was named after the football stadium.
 So they set up a searching rescue team there and they had a lot of CB radio enthusiasts searching and, you know, the kids were searching and the parents were searching and you would hear helicopters and low flying planes and it was just complete.
 cacophony of sound and just surreal, and looking for Andy.
 And just as quickly as all that started, it stopped.
 After just six days, they stopped looking.
 And for whatever reason, I don't know,
 none of it was explained to us children.
 There was no sort of sitting us down.
 There was no school counseling.
 There was none of that back then.
 It was just sort of pretend nothing happened.
 Life is normal.
 We got these really ambiguous warnings like, you know,
 if somebody is asking you to look for their dog, don't help them, stay away from white vans, just like really ambiguous things.
 You didn't know what was what.
 And I just remember being so heartbroken and just really bewildered by,
 how the search could stop.
 And I have this very vivid memory of standing outside of my unit in the projects underneath this tree that was like one of my favorite places.
 And I was pondering this and I just, with all this conviction of a nine-year-old, I told myself and Andy that when I grew up, I would try to find him.
 And I realize now that that was super naive, but it was also sort of a moment in life when, you know, I guess my destiny was defined and I didn't realize it, you know, part of my destiny was defined and I didn't realize it.
 And so then I went away to college and, you know, ended up, I mean, there was, there's a lot in between there, but, you know, I, I, I became a ward of the state.
 I was a foster kid as well.
 So I was a really marginalized kid and I can understand
 kids being in systems where they're further marginalized.
 And so I had that experience, but I was very fortunate to have an aunt that could take me in and she took me in and she nurtured me back to health and really helped get me back on my feet and sent me to college.
 And unfortunately when I was 18, she died.
 So I went with her when I was 14.
 And then by the time I was 18, she passed away.
 So I was on my own again, but I was able to finish college and I majored in human services and
 communications media.
 And I had an advisor, as I was talking about these dual majors and what I should do with them, suggest that I should make social justice documentaries, or social justice films.
 And I was like, oh, that's a good idea.
 Yeah, I'll do that.
 And I got an internship at WGBH in Boston and I loved, I went to Fitchburg State undergrad and they were the only university at the time that required a full-time internship before you could graduate.
 So that really put me ahead of a lot of the more elite colleges.
 And I ended up being hired by WGBH because I was the intern that was there every day and was working.
 And so my first job, I was a production assistant there and then an associate producer and then became a segment producer and just sort of went up the chain.
 And after about 15 years of doing that, I decided it was time to make my own film.
 I wanted to make my own film.
 I had been helping independent filmmakers and I thought I could be, you know, maybe I could do this as an independent.
 And I thought long and hard about it.
 And I knew seeing other independents and how they worked that if I was going to do this, it was going to have to be something that I would do whether I got paid for it or not, like that I would want to do whether I got paid for it or not.
 And I thought, what is that?
 And maybe there were two or three things that I thought I would want to do.
 And one of them was to find out what happened to Andy.
 And so in 1998, I decided I would make a documentary about Andy, again, very naively.
 But I had some experience.
 I knew how to do research as an associate producer.
 I knew how to
 coordinate my research and organize it and that sort of stuff.
 So the first call I made was to Andy's mom and we talked and the first thing Andy's mother said to me on that phone call was, this is way bigger than you understand or that you can realize.
 I remember at the time not quite knowing what that meant, but also thinking that maybe it was sort of the musings of a bereft mother that like, of course her child's disappearance is bigger than anything anyone could imagine, but I didn't realize that she wasn't talking just figuratively, she was speaking literally.
 And I would find that out as the years went by.
 And so it took me probably, I don't know, five to seven years
 making that documentary, primarily self-funded with some seed money from WGBH, which was super helpful.
 And from friends that would do quid pro quo gigs, like my sound man and cameraman would trade services to do the shoots and stuff like that.
 So that was great.
 And after a while of working on it and getting it into good shape with a fantastic editor, Rachel Clark,
 we pitched it to HBO.
 We had pitched it to HBO very early and they were like, yeah, make it and then come back to us.
 And so we did and they didn't respond for a couple of months.
 I remember that.
 And then finally it was like Labor Day weekend.
 And I was like, you know what, I'm just gonna call them and essentially be like, do you want it or not?
 Cause I'm gonna start shopping it elsewhere.
 And they said, I promise we'll watch it this weekend.
 And on Monday they contacted me and said, you know, when can you come to New York?
 So my editor and I flew out to New York and the head of HBO documentary, who was a legend in her own time, Sheila Nevins,
 met with us with her team and spent four hours with us going over the film.
 And I remember walking out that day and we didn't have a signed deal or anything, but we got outside of the building and I started jumping up and down.
 And my editor was like, what are you doing?
 And I'm like, oh my God, HBO is going to take the film.
 And she's like, what are you talking about?
 I'm like, Sheila Nevins doesn't spend four hours with anybody if she's not going to take what they have.
 I went and bought what I considered to be an expensive pair of shoes, which was a hundred dollars at the time, a hundred dollar pair of shoes.
 And that was my treat to myself.
 And we were off, you know, when we made this documentary and it was so validating and it was so important and it was such hard work.
 And honestly, I should have been in therapy when I was doing it.
 And I wasn't, instead I was raising, you know, birthing and raising two kids and doing all these things, but it was a really hard film to make.
 you know, the day that it broadcast, it was June, 2007.
 And they had asked, HBO had asked if we wanted a party in New York or California.
 And I said, no, I want a party in Lawrence.
 And we had it at the theater that Andy and I used to go to as kids.
 And I remember the night that it was shown, it was like 400 people, the theater was packed.
 It was people from kindergarten to college and, you know, everywhere in between and Andy's family, of course.
 all of the important people that matter to me to hear this story, this communal tragedy, right?
 Like it was also all the kids I had grown up with who never really knew what happened and would be able to see this, you know?
 And I remember taking a moment and looking out at this audience and thinking, oh my God, like, what am I gonna do next that's gonna feel this important?
 You know, which is kind of was a character flaw of my own at the time.
 Instead of just being able to be in the moment and just enjoy this accomplishment, it was like, okay, what's next?
 And I'm getting better at that.
 And I would find out what was next.
 Six months later, I was pregnant.
 I would find out that I was pregnant with our third child.
 who we would learn prenatally had down syndrome and a congenital heart defect and would require open heart surgery after she was born.
 And so the film came out in June and Gracie was born in December.
 So it was, I got my answer pretty quickly from the universe about what I was doing next.
 Yeah.
 And, you know, I took 10 years of caring for my family and learning about disability and becoming a disability advocate and, you know, taking a year long fellowship and, you know, just all of the things that I did, you know, advocating for her in school and all of those things during that 10 years.
 And I say that I was a child advocate from the time I was a child because I did, you know, go into DSS of my own volition, like I wanted to leave
 what have you, but Gracie professionalized my advocacy.
 She gave me a masterclass in advocacy, and I learned how to truly become a child advocate and how to build relationships to create effective systemic change.
 And I ended up deciding to go to Harvard to get a master's in education policy, because again, I wanna change systems for marginalized kids.
 And the movement was going a little too slow for me.
 And I thought maybe if I could just get a master's at Harvard with the mentor who does inclusive education, I'd be able to fix it all.
 Which again, I don't know, I always look back at how naive I was at all these things.
 And I'm like, I hope I'm not as naive as I was, but I'm sure I'll look back years from now and think the same.
 I ended up getting a master's at Harvard and it was 2017.
 And a lot of things were happening that year.
 It was the Me Too movement.
 I had learned about adverse childhood experience study, ACEs, and how childhood trauma affects our outcomes in our life.
 And was having a lot of that experience myself and was recognizing it in myself.
 And the Me Too movement was triggering a lot of that as well.
 And then, you know, one day I was driving down the street and listening to NPR and on the radio came this story about how the FBI were digging in the backyard of a man in Georgetown, Mass.
 And they were allegedly looking for a child, a victim of homicide.
 And
 I had been trying to get the police to listen to that story for 10 years.
 The victim who had gone to the police 10 years earlier, one of the alleged victims of this man who said he witnessed this child murder had come to me shortly after he had seen the film.
 I suspect the film probably triggered some things for him.
 He came to me and was exploring because he was trying to find out who the child might be that he said he had witnessed the murder of.
 And I,
 advocated for him and tried to get him in touch with state police and local police and others, you know, the attorney general's office and others.
 And people, you know, for the most part just sort of pushed him along.
 And part of it was because he had his own trauma and, you know, he had some things going on.
 And I think for some of law enforcement that discredited him or, you know, in their eyes and,
 I think the opposite.
 I think that when we find people who have that kind of trauma that say that they've witnessed these kinds of things, it's usually evidence that they did witness these kinds of things, as opposed to otherwise.
 But he was sort of not seen as credible in their eyes for a long time.
 And then the
 this man that he had accused had passed away and the police had to go into his home for a check to rule out foul play, which was just standard procedure in Massachusetts if someone dies in their home.
 And when they went into this man's house, they saw all kinds of incriminating evidence.
 There were boy mannequins dressed up in soccer uniforms, and there were hundreds of identifications of children.
 This man had been a soccer coach for years in Beverly and Averill.
 and I think Georgetown and all sorts of videotapes with questionable titles on them.
 And it just, it was, it reminded me, I've seen some of the pictures and honestly, it reminded me of like the scene in Silence of the Lambs when you see Buffalo Bill's house, right?
 Like it literally looked like that.
 It was just like, and I think they were like, uh-oh, we should have paid attention to that victim.
 who they refer to as witness X, who I refer to as witness X or whatever.
 But I was driving down the road and I was triggered by this trauma and I came home and I recognized the trauma trigger, thankfully, but I came home and I pulled out all of my material from the documentary and the police reports and the files and the tapes and everything out of my closet.
 And I was sitting in the middle of this pile of stuff
 And I thought, what do I do with this?
 And I knew when I was finishing Andy's documentary that instead of coming to a conclusion, I was coming to another chapter in the story, but I had to stop at that point.
 The film was due.
 And I think also life was calling me to do other things.
 And frankly, I'm grateful that I stopped at that point, because I think had I kept going,
 I probably would not have, my mental health probably wouldn't have survived.
 So I needed that break and I needed that time to become trauma informed really, and to be able to put supports in place before I could go back into it.
 But in 2017, I decided, all right, I'm going back in.
 I liken it to that scene in the Godfather with Michael Corleone, when he's like, every time I try to get out, they pull me back in.
 And I say, like, that's how trauma is, right?
 Like every time you think you're out, you get pulled back in.
 But the way that I,
 cope with my own childhood trauma is through advocacy and through truth telling.
 And I didn't realize that that's actually a very effective way to cope with trauma.
 In fact, I have a trauma expert that's on my podcast.
 and she just wrote a book, her name is Judy Herman, and she just wrote a book called Truth and Repair.
 Her second book, yeah, at 84.
 After a long time of.
 Her own trauma, she was in a lot of pain.
 She had an accident, was in a lot of pain, and had to derail her career for a while.
 But at 84, she just wrote her second book.
 And she's considered the mother of trauma.
 Her and Bessel van der Kolk started out together.
 He's sort of, I guess, the father of trauma, if you would say it.
 But they were the ones who named trauma.
 Speaking of naming things, there wasn't a name for trauma in the 90s, and they named, or if there was, it was PTSD, and it was very specific to veterans.
 And Judy Carmen named trauma
 as being something that's also in our homes and in our lives.
 And her and Bessel, who wrote The Body Keeps the Score, Bessel van der Kolk, just changed the landscape for trauma survivors.
 And when I interviewed Judy, she was amazing, because she said she did a lot of work on incest.
 She said, you know, the data at that point was saying that, you know, incest survivors were 2 million to one.
 And she said, and I got my doctorate from Harvard and I set up my shingle and I, you know, started my private practice.
 She said, and in that very week, I had three incest survivors come in to see me.
 And I was like, there's something wrong with the data.
 And, you know, she knew.
 And so she wrote, she specialized in that and she wrote a book back then.
 of trauma and resilience.
 Oh, trauma and recovery, right.
 And then 84 is truth and repair.
 And her book, truth and repair was really, you know, a revelation to me as I read it, because what she talks about in this book is that
 we heal trauma through advocacy and through empowerment.
 But the way that that happens is that it has to be supported by community.
 We have to have upstanders in our community who are willing to support the truth and allow for the advocacy.
 and then the empowerment and the healing can happen, which was really a big deal, is really a big deal for me.
 And it really was like, oh my God, this is the whole purpose of this podcast.
 And in some ways it's been like the whole purpose of my life.
 And Bessel's book had that same effect on me.
 Like I read Bessel's book on, you know, the body keeps the score and I was blown away by how much it related to my life and to the life of so many people I know and so many people who don't know about ACEs and childhood trauma and trauma in general.
 So I decided the cost effective way for me to do this and tell this story and do a deeper dive would be to do a podcast.
 I mean, my experience was in documentary filmmaking and it's quite expensive, you know, and it's a lot of work and you have to have a lot of crew and there's just a lot.
 And I thought, okay, you know, I like this new genre.
 I think it's a deep dive into materials.
 I had been listening to a couple of podcasts that really affected me, like Barebrook and
 crime town and just a few.
 And I, you know, so I started to, to listen to them and to basically educate myself and try to learn how to, to make them.
 And so, but I've been working on this project sort of off and on since 2017.
 And finally, you know, with the help of a lot of people, just to be clear, nobody does this work alone.
 And I have an incredible composer who I think just really brings the stories to life and editor and, you know, coordinating producer who's really helped me to,
 just understand what the FRSS feed is and how to get it loaded.
 But just like basic things and just a great team, researchers both volunteer and paid that have come up along the line.
 And this is tough work.
 I mean, this is hard work looking at unsolved missing and murdered children's cases and really looking at them.
 And so I had this hypothesis that
 While I was at Harvard, I had to take a statistics class.
 And speaking of data, and Judy's story about data and the two million to one, I had to take a statistics class.
 And as I was contemplating this idea, I had to tell this story again, I thought,
 why not use data to tell this story?
 I've had so many people sort of be disbelieving in where my research has been leading me.
 Why don't I use qualitative and quantitative data and prove what I'm finding?
 And so I did.
 I had a hypothesis that perhaps
 murdered children, recovered homicide victims from the 1970s might be able to inform missing children's cases.
 Because I thought before this, I thought Andy's case was an anomaly.
 But as I started to research through the film,
 And otherwise, I found that Andy's case wasn't an anomaly, that Andy was one of several children who went missing in Massachusetts in the 1970s, and that it was far more common than, frankly, any of us realized.
 And I wanted to know why.
 And so I wanted to see if the same was true with homicide.
 So I ended up, you know, getting vital statistics from DPH and, you know, all deaths, zero to 19, and then finding out about how they code deaths, you know, deaths and, you know, disaggregating homicide data.
 I started, you know, putting together this data and it really,
 in my opinion, it really supports the hypothesis.
 There are dozens of unsolved missing and murdered children's cases from the 1970s, unsolved.
 And so I started to dig into those cases as well.
 And I started to bring my research to law enforcement.
 I would meet with district attorneys.
 I met with the attorney general and anybody, frankly, that would listen to say, look it, something was going on in the 70s.
 Like this data doesn't,
 make, you know, it adds up to something more.
 And, and several of the victims also had, were, you know, the homicide victims had died in the same manner, you know, and again, they were all unsolved.
 They're still all unsolved.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00112&t=1842.091s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Se konsa, sa a se yon gwo pwoblèm.
 Lè sa a, mwen jis ap fè done yo ak fè podcast la, ak Lè sa a ,,
 7 septanm, jou kap vini an nan ane sa a, repons lan se wi, repons lan se wi, jou a apre anivèsè nesans Andy a, nou te lanse podcast la.
 Sa a se yon seri de uit etid ki analize ka nan Massachusetts, Massachusetts, ki manke ak touye nan lane 1970 yo.
 Istwa a nan timoun trafik nan Massachusetts ak nan tout peyi a se yon tèm gwo ak ankonbran.
 Men, ankò, lè li rive vokabilè, pa te gen okenn non nan moman sa a.
 Moun yo pa gen okenn mo pou trafik an pèsòn.
 Li pa t 'jouk ane 1990 yo ke li te antre nan diksyonè a.
 Aktyèlman, jan nou di nan podcast la, pa gen okenn mo sou pedofili.
 Sa a se pa menm yon mo òdinè.
 Ak timoun yo dwe wè epi yo pa tande.
 Si yo kwè li, trè kèk.
 Natirèlman, timoun pòv ak majinalize ki ka akize oswa abize yo ka akize de oswa abize
 Moun rich oswa moun ki gen privilèj pa pral kwè li.
 Kòm nou tout konnen, nan lane 2001, Boston Globe a te kraze eskandal lan abi dokiman Pwen Enpòtan ak pi popilè fim eksepsyonèl, ki tou te genyen Oscar a, ak Boston Globe a te genyen Pulitzer la
 Fim nan te genyen yon Oscar ak devwale tout kilti a nan abi seksyèl nan Massachusetts nan ane 1970 yo, men se pa sèlman Massachusetts, dwa?
 Nan tout peyi a, nan tout mond lan.
 Mwen vle di, kat la tit final nan fim sa a se tankou yon lis tout kote yo diferan kote sa rive.
 Apre sa, mwen pa konnen, mwen pa ka wè nenpòt ki moun ki ka gade fim sa a oswa li seri sa yo ak panse sa yo se yon pòm move.
 Se jis ensidans la nan pastè nan yon pawas, ou konnen, x kantite timoun yo.
 Mwen vle di, li se yon atmosfè nan abi kiltirèl ak sistematik timoun.
 Moun yo pa renmen pale sou li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00112&t=2000.765s">[Danielle Balocca]</a>: Oke, mwen panse ke li nan yon istwa trè konplè.
 Li sanble tankou anfans, ou te fè eksperyans yon anpil nan chòk, dwa?
 Epi, yon bagay rive ou, di tèt ou simonte li, epi mwen pral mennen ankèt sou li.
 Mwen pral jwenn Andy.
 Kisa mwen panse sa a se
 Kòm yon pwojè pi gwo ak yon rezilta trè diferan, li te vin yon antye.
 Epi, ou konnen, mwen panse nan karyè mwen, mwen travay nan sant la nan kriz vyòl, nou konnen, ak viktim yo ak moun ki sove nan chòk seksyèl, sa ou di, tankou jistis, jistis, jistis, jistis, jistis, jistis, jistis, jistis,
 Mwen panse ke li sanble tankou nou gen lide ke si bagay sa yo rive, sistèm legal la kriminèl pral pran swen yo.
 Sa a pa ka a, dwa?
 Mwen panse ke nou panse petèt fason pou etabli yon sistèm legal kriminèl se priyorite bezwen gwoup vilnerab yo, men pito bezwen moun ki nan pouvwa.
 Mwen pa panse ou sanble mesaj pitit ou a resevwa lè li se yon timoun.
 Se pou nou pa envestige sa a.
 Se pou nou pase sis jou, jis tankou w ap enkyete, ak Lè sa a, nou kontinye deplase pi devan.
 Mwen panse ke, ou konnen, travay la w ap fè kounye a sanble yo dwe yon fason, ou konnen, montre ou sot pase ou, ak tout timoun yo enpòtan, lavi yo yo
 Li vo envestige, ou konnen ki sa mwen te kite soti nan nouvo liv Judith Herman a se sa ou konnen, e ke pa nesesèman pini otè a.
 Li evidan, nou pa konnen, nou pa vle yo kontinye fè sa yo ap fè, men kòm moun ki kwè, sa k ap pase se enpòtan, epi ou konnen, nou pa vle li kenbe k ap pase ak
 Jis tankou dokimantè sa a, dokimantè ou ak podcasts reyèlman sipriz m ', omwen mwen sanble yo tande ki jan moun pale sou chòk yo chak jou.
 Nan Episode 1, li la twoublan ki jan yo pale sou jèn timoun lè ou jwe tankou sa a riban pedofili.
 Sa a se tou reyalite, dwa?
 Mwen panse ke sa a se
 Sa yo se bagay enpòtan nou ap pale de paske yo ap pase, dwa?
 Nou pa ka inyore yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00112&t=2144.396s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Men, repons lan se wi, mwen panse ke wi, sa a, se lajman, Danielle, pafwa nan yon sans, premye nan tout, ou santi ou refwadi nan sa ou di, paske sa ki pi enpòtan, bagay ki pi enpòtan yon moun di moun ki chape a se, mwen kwè ou.
 Mwen p'ap janm bliye lè mwen pote l 'atire atansyon a sitiyasyon sa yo ak pwoblèm sa yo.
 Koulye a, ou konnen ankò, mwen konnen, wi, mwen te grandi sou pwojè a, mwen se Lawrence, e mwen fyè de reyalite sa a.
 Mwen konnen, li te anseye m anpil.
 ak
 Mwen menm tou mwen te resevwa prim lan Emmy ak te ale nan Harvard, dwa?
 Se konsa, petèt mwen gen yon bagay ke mwen gen, menm si mwen panse mwen gen kredibilite ak ka grandi sou pwojè, kredibilite mwen nan lari a ak tout bagay mwen te siviv, mwen renmen pati sa a nan mwen, ki se yon gwo pati nan defans mwen an.
 Apre sa, mwen tou ap eseye lòt wout pou sa yo tantativ nonmen, dwa?
 Se konsa, petèt ou ka gen sa a kalite angajman kredibilite san yo pa yon randevou, dwa?
 Moun yo ap kwè
 Kèlkeswa medya mwen vle jwenn, pa vre?
 Verite a se ke menm avèk sètifika sa yo, yo ap toujou kòmande sou mwen.
 Mwen vle di, mwen te pral jwenn yon moun tankou Bondye mwen epi ou pa ta kwè li.
 Li sanble tankou yo gen kèk materyèl reyèl, ak franchman, moun tou senpleman pa kwè li.
 Gen kèk dokiman jidisyè oswa dosye lapolis, mwen toujou gen yo dwe etone pou yo.
 Yo se istwa etonan.
 Mwen pral eseye pataje li avèk yo
 oswa lòt manm medya oswa posib finansye oswa nenpòt moun ki.
 Apre sa, li te resevwa yon bagay ki sanble, o, ou ta ka yon mato kap chèche klou.
 Oswa literalman fè yon moun di m ', ok, petèt
 Petèt kredibilite li yo se yon pwoblèm.
 Mwen te panse, ki sa?
 Jis tankou repòtè a ki te genyen pwi a Grand, tankou nan yon konvèsasyon 15-minit, li te tankou yo te lage, tankou, ki kote li te soti?
 Ki sa ki?
 Li enteresan paske mwen panse ke kèk nan li se misogyny, dwa?
 Genyen tou konpetisyon fanm lan, epi li sanble tankou gen anpil bagay, men li vrèman plezi konvenk moun.
 Men, sou yon nòt pozitif, gen kèk kwè ke youn nan yo,
 Li te yon pwosekitè pou zòn nan Konte Suffolk nan moman sa a ak te vin amors Ameriken an Rachel Rollins.
 Li reouvri plizyè ka nou te pote.
 Li louvri moute ekip li a plizyè nan omisid yo ki pako rezoud ak kontinye travay sou yo.
 Yo te pote fanmi yo ak te gen yon gwo enpak sou lavi yo nan fanmi sa yo.
 Sa a se etonan.
 Sa te rive, li te fè li.
 Mwen panse ke yon pati nan li se paske li se yon fanm ki se pi sansib a bagay sa yo.
 Li se tou manman adoptif nan nyès li.
 Lè sa a, mwen panse ke li te aprann tou yon bagay nan yon nivo pèsonèl.
 Epi, ou konnen, men mwen tou te resevwa nan youn nan ekip legal yo ou travay avèk nan yon kote
 Depatman Lapolis, lè mwen eseye pote PowerPoints sa yo nan done yo, ou konnen, ou konnen tout bagay sa yo.
 Se tankou eseye leve PowerPoint mwen, li pa travay, mwen gen yon ti koton nan bouch mwen, mwen ta ka deklanche, tout lòt bagay yo, paske se yon lòt bagay.
 Lè otorite deklannche m ', dwa?
 Lè lapolis te deklanche m ', dwa?
 Èske w konnen sa mwen vle di?
 Nan kote sa yo.
 Men, mwen pap janm bliye li.
 Mwen pap janm bliye entèvyou legal la, li te sispann m ', li te ban m' dlo, li te di: Èske mwen ka sispann li pou yon minit?
 Mwen te di, wi.
 Li te di, mwen kwè nan ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00112&t=2361.639s">[Danielle Balocca]</a>: Wi, li se konsa pwisan ak fwistre ke gen moun ki pa tande li, oswa sèlman kote sa yo kèk konprann li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00112&t=2370.789s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 我相信你，这是我告诉我他们的故事时，我告诉我的第一件事。
 我在播客中说，我在第二集中说，我相信你。
 这很重要。
 而且，如果您也听到我的动作，而其他试图讲故事多年来的人将被交给他们或付钱或付钱，那就像所有这些创伤一样，然后不会消失。
 但是对我而言，媒体在某种意义上很有用
 实际上有一些验证，还有一些主张。
 其中一些纪录片达到了3500万人。
 我有来自中国和泰国的人，我有一个来自中国的美丽妻子，她取得了联系，她做到了，我在这里的墙上，但是她做得很大，我不知道，10 x 12，不，大，大，大，大，海报大小，海报，海报，海报，海报，海报，
 拼图，这是安迪的形象，但违反个人的每一部分都是中国的儿童，他们保留了安迪的形象。
 她向我保证，她肯定会在中国教孩子
 儿童安全以及如何保护自己。
 哦，天哪，这就像您是这种事情，它的重要性。
 这有所不同。
 播客是在第三集中。
 目前下载了25,000次。
 我们是Apple播客中的趋势。
 在Apple真正的犯罪类别的第一周，我们处于前30名。
 这在独立播客中是前所未有的。
 那是另一件事。
 这个播客是独立的。
 没有人会捡起它。
 相同。
 就像没有其他人……我知道这是一件困难的事情。
 我明白。
 人们就像，哦，但是那里有很多困难的问题，很多人涵盖了它们。
 这就是这样...我的意思是，我认为肯定是八年前，当我扔掉它时，这也是一种……披萨的整个问题，这太可怕了。
 不，但是预防儿童性虐待真的很可怕，因为人们可以排除诸如哦，这不是事实的事情。
 这是一个阴谋。
 他们只是在我们的社会中丢弃了事情，因为很难听到或不想谈论它。
 所以我告诉别人当你听到狩猎女巫的话时，
 使您的耳朵更加动画，简单地说：这是什么？
 因为您会在周二发行的情节中看到，这是一个非常有力的情节，称为另一个波士顿性丑闻，有一群男人在城市和城市中贩运孩子，他们形成了
 它成为该国第一个名为Nambla的恋童癖组织，北美男孩协会。
 那是在安迪失踪几个月后仅几个月的马萨诸塞州里维尔（Revere），其他许多孩子像安迪（Andy）消失了。
 而且，嗯，
 您知道，他们是医生和百万富翁，而且您知道，董事参加了私立精英学校，您知道所有这些特权的人。
 但是人们不知道的是，在此之前的两年之前，我在下一集的播客中收取它
 您知道，有一位社会服务主管，他建立了一个假招待所，并正在将孩子贩运到恋童癖者。
 而且，您知道，他们创建了一个工作组，以调查为什么感谢上帝，这名波士顿凶杀案侦探不会放手。
 他知道，他独自一人，他不相信这是一个孩子的自杀，只像骨头一样保留，这不会离开案件。
 最后，
 他的调查导致了检察官办公室与波士顿和DCF警察之间的这一部队的互动任务，后来被称为井 - 鲍勃·普比里奇部。
 他们应该调查5,000名父母的孩子和3200家房屋，以确定许多孩子实际上被放置
 他们当时称之为已知的同性恋男人，因为当时的同性恋和恋童癖的结合很大，因为这是同性恋权利运动的时代，人们仍然像今天一样，人们仍然非常歧视。
 而且，但波士顿有一个很棒的故事。
 这真的很令人惊讶，我希望如何接受面试，因为
 您知道，这些恋童癖者试图加入1970年代马萨诸塞州同性恋权利的合法运动。
 而且他是同性恋，或者是同性恋女性，您知道的是女同性恋女性。
 他们就像，不，您知道，代表伊莱恩·诺布尔（Elaine Noble），他是众所周知的，只有同性恋权利的伟大捍卫者说：不，您不会和我们一起游行。
 你不是，我们不是
 我们不与您同在，我们不相信孩子，这是其中的一部分。
 因此，这确实很了不起，但是他们试图进入同性恋权利运动。
 因此，他们将其中的很多与同性恋权利相匹配。
 但是当天记录的方式是将他们与已知的同性恋单身男人一起放置。
 但实际上，这些人是恋童癖者和罗克斯伯里办公室的社会工作主管，至少据说是100名儿童。
 但是，您知道，我制作了一个FOIA，这是该工作组记录中的信息自由的要求，为什么我想知道结果如何，好吧，报告的情况如何？
 他们决定了什么？
 多少？
 你知道，答案是什么？
 什么都没有，什么都没有。
 似乎没有人记得有一个工作组。
 AG办公室说没有文件。
 如果我与人们交谈，这是一个活生生的故事。
 我的意思是，我的意思是，我还活着。
 然后，许多人在发生时仍然还活着。
 令人惊讶的是，他们似乎不记得或不想谈论它。
 这非常非常了不起。
 这是在这个崇敬之环开始的两年之后，这是Nambla组织的创建。
 因此，您知道，这些孩子在全国和马萨诸塞州的交通环，没有人真正意识到这正在发生。
 而且，您知道，我们现在没有媒体。
 我们没有。
 互联网。
 我们一会儿无法学习。
 我们有一些渠道，仅此而已。
 如果有报道，请报告。
 如果不是，那不是。
 我们不知道。
 并发现，您还将在播客中发现这是一个国家问题。
 最后，有一些国会听众一直在制定避免的第一条法律
 儿童色情制品，因为这甚至不是非法的。
 这太疯狂了。
 但这就像一般的全景，来自一个非常个人的地方。
 然后我们回到一个非常个人的地方
 国防和行动呼吁。
 我真正想要这个播客，我希望这个播客会有些事情。
 一个是，我想要一个马萨诸塞州的研究小组，其中包括1970年代缺席和死去的儿童的这些尚未解决的案件。
 我很想看到这发生了。
 我很想看到一个失踪人员创建的数据库，目前尚不存在。
 我做出立法辩护。
 我们与参议员琼·可爱（Joan Lovely）合作，后者为结束限制的状态做了很多工作，这对此非常重要。
 这是另一个呼吁采取行动。
 但是我也怀疑我不怀疑我知道从那时
 That was part of this organized and coordinated abuse, and that have not been giftd, that or have not ben gifted gut community will not represent them or Believe Them, or guts they are expected to be strong, or women who are expected not to speak, or, you Know, You Know, You Know, You Know, You Know, You Already Know,
 他患有成瘾，无法死亡或死于创伤。
 但是我怀疑劳伦斯还有更多的受害者和劳伦斯的幸存者。
 我希望您能听到这个播客，并知道有一个社区，有一群幸存者试图将结果改变为子孙后代，我们相信并希望帮助他们。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00112&t=2885.949s">[Danielle Balocca]</a>: Wi, mèsi.
 Wi, li sanble ke pwosesis la nan fè dokimantè ak podcasts ba ou kèk itil eleman ki ka geri ou.
 Pou kèk objektif, li son tankou kèk objektif pral afekte lokalman.
 Se konsa, ki jan nou ka wè li kòm yon pwoblèm reyèl, petèt sa nou vle?
 Peye plis atansyon.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00112&t=2908.86s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Mwen panse ke yon sèl bagay, repons lan se wi, byen, plis oswa mwens, repons lan se wi, di ou mèsi pou pote li nan travay lokal yo, tou, paske youn nan bagay sa yo se, wi, mwen te fè, epi li vrèman fè m 'gen yo etidye pa sèlman chòk nan kominote a ak chòk nan kominote a, men tou, chòk pèsonèl.
 Se poutèt sa mwen rekòmande terapi chòk.
 Mwen panse ke sa a se reyèlman enpòtan.
 Mwen pa panse moun ta dwe eksplore sa a san yo pa sipò ki kalifye.
 Mwen panse ke sa a se yon pwoblèm difisil.
 Mwen panse ke sa a podcast ka deklanche pou kèk moun, e mwen konprann.
 Men, mwen panse tou ke li vrèman enpòtan, tankou si yon moun ki la, o, mwen pa konnen si mwen ka tande li paske li difisil pou tande li.
 Mwen panse ke, wi, non, mwen sèten.
 Mwen te di, imajine ki jan difisil li se yo dwe timoun tande oswa ou pa.
 Se konsa, tankou, mwen panse ke sa a se pi piti a nou ka fè se koute istwa sa yo epi eseye fè yon bagay pou timoun sa yo, moun ki sove ak timoun ki toujou ap pase jodi an.
 Mwen ka jwenn
 Ou konnen, kèk moun ki sove nan Etazini yo ak Mitch Garabitian jwe kèk moun ki sove ak Mitch Garabitian nan dokiman Pwen Enpòtan fim nan.
 Mwen sonje yon nèg sou tab la ki di Mitch Garabitian, byen, ou konnen, li te yon bon bout tan.
 Èske yon bagay k ap pase jodi a?
 Kisa k ap pase ak Mickey? Èske w ap jwe?
 Ou konnen, e nou pa menm konnen poukisa pifò moun pa pale sou abi seksyèl nan men timoun yo, jiska 40 oswa 50.
 Se konsa, ou konnen, pale ak yo nan 30 ane.
 Men, nan zòn lokal la, nan travay lokal la, ou konnen, Carmen difisil, sa a se yon lòt
 Avoka yo se gwo aktivis pou travay sa a.
 Mwen konnen ke mwen te fè yon sijesyon konplè nan konsèy la mwen te rele Carmen Rele a, ki te rele Timoun Maske, se kounye a yon òganizasyon san bi likratif, kounye a yon kanpay jistis timoun ak kanpay ase abi.
 Carmen gen yon anpil nan pwen nan abi nan lekòl la paske ou konnen sa ki te pase plizyè fwa lè abi a te rive se ke agresè yo rete an silans, pa diferan de Legliz Katolik la, se konsa yo pral bay yo ak opòtinite pou yo kite posts yo olye pou yo te revoke.
 ak nenpòt lòt frè ki parèt oswa nenpòt ki lòt frè.
 Se konsa, sa ki te pase yo te ke yo te kapab sèlman ale nan lekòl nan lari a oswa kèk lòt zòn ak Lè sa a, dwe anboche ankò, petèt yon bagay ki te pase apre sa, dwa?
 Se konsa, li nan menm bagay la.
 Yo rele sa a apa de fatra a nan "kominote a prevansyon CSA".
 Men Carmen ap travay di.
 Gen anpil mask, timoun ak abi.
 Se konsa, apre uploading sijesyon li, direktè egzekitif Jetta Bernier pataje li avè m '
 Yon kou ki resevwa fòmasyon pou idantifye konpòtman preparatwa ak lòt konpòtman.
 Nou di Bondye mèsi pi vit ke posib, ou konnen, Dean Maurice-Edouard Vincent te patisipe nan rezime a epi li se kounye a yon fòmasyon obligatwa nan zòn nou an.
 Sa a se rezilta sibvansyon mwen te renmen an, sa vle di, mas yo te lontan anvan mwen te antre nan tablo direktè yo.
 Ou konnen, yo te fè travay sa a nan lòt zòn,
 Sa a se yon bagay nou ka pote nan Medford, jis konekte direktè lekòl la ak mas yo.
 Yo mennen l 'nan tèt la nan kredibilite a ak kredibilite nan gouvènman l' yo.
 Ki sa nou tande soti nan kòmantè yo te trè itil ak te fè yon gwo diferans.
 Se poutèt sa, gen yon lòt etap pou pi devan pou kou sa a, ak mas yo espere travay ak Medford lekòl piblik yo amelyore li.
 Nou menm tou nou te eseye òganize yon reyinyon avèk yo.
 Se poutèt sa, sa a se yon travay trè, trè enpòtan.
 Kominote a gen yon responsablite pou fè sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00112&t=3122.42s">[Danielle Balocca]</a>: Wi, non, mwen panse ke yon sèl bagay mwen gen sou abi sa a se faktè a pouvwa, dwa?
 Mwen panse ke anpil
 Nan nenpòt ki kalite ofans seksyèl, menm si li se yon viktim granmoun, gen plis atansyon a pwoteje otè a.
 Epi, si li pa kondane pa yon bagay, pa gen tandans swiv yo.
 Nou konnen li difisil pou kondannen moun.
 E gen timoun, lè timoun yo se viktim,
 Ou konnen, li sanble nou vle panse osijè de pwoteje santiman ki lojik timoun yo, men nou ap panse plis sou dwa granmoun ak bezwen ak ki jan, ki jan yo gade nan fatra.
 Sa a se reyèlman vre, li nan terib.
 Lè nou pale, ou konnen, nou pa ka divilge sa moun sa a fè oswa pa ka pale sou yo.
 Tankou, dwa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00112&t=3176.84s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Mwen konnen, sa a se fou.
 Oke, alontèm branch, sa a, se li.
 Tankou moun, sa a se pa yon egzanp inik.
 Mwen vle di, enpak la sou lavi timoun yo pral afekte yo pandan tout lavi yo.
 Se konsa, ou konnen, sa a se yon lòt.
 Li te pase desann soti nan jenerasyon an jenerasyon, li se anpil lòt bagay,
 Li vire tou alantou pwoteje timoun yo ak nonmen yo.
 Mwen panse ke lòt bagay la se, mwen di yon sèl bagay mwen di: pati ki pi bon sou ale nan Harvard, e onètman, li nan verite a, bagay ki pi enpòtan mwen te aprann nan men Harvard se ke tout bagay gen yon mo.
 Yon fwa ou konprann mo a, ou ka kòmanse atake pwoblèm nan, dwa?
 Lè sa a, Se poutèt sa mwen tape sa a podcast, ki enplike reyalite sa yo.
 Omoseksyèl endividyèl pa matche ak pedofili, dwa?
 Men, pedofili se, dwa?
 Oswa, ou konnen, pa te gen okenn trafik nan moman an.
 Èske w konnen sa yo rele yo?
 Mwen sèten wi.
 Èske w konnen sa yo te rele l 'nan moman sa a?
 Non mwen pa fè sa.
 Pwostitisyon timoun yo.
 Oh, sa a gwo.
 Pwostitisyon timoun yo.
 Poukisa ou plèzantri?
 Nan Episode nan pwochen, nou gen yon sivivan, ou konnen,
 Li idantifye kòm yon jennès ki nonmen timoun yo, men timoun yo pa ka fanm movèz vi tèt yo.
 Yo pa gen okenn kapasite yo dakò.
 Sa a li.
 Men, lòt la se pou tounen nan mo, tout bagay gen yon sèl mo.
 Mwen pa konnen ke Andy ak mwen pa gen anyen nan tan lontan an ki te rele kapital sosyal.
 Mwen konnen
 Ase yo konnen ki sa sa a se, timoun mwen yo ap genyen li.
 Mwen pral la.
 Mwen vle defann yo.
 Moun yo pral konnen ke sa yo se pa timoun yo ou resevwa.
 Sa yo se tout.
 Mwen planifye pou fè anyen, kouri pou komite lekòl la, fè anyen.
 Men, yon lòt moso pa sèlman fè li pou pitit gason m ', men tou pou tout sistèm lan ak pou lòt timoun yo.
 Paske mwen se timoun sa a, pwofesè a pa ka jwenn twòp atansyon paske
 Manman m 'pa pral patisipe nan reyinyon PTO.
 Manman mwen pa t 'mande m' poukisa mwen te arete oswa nenpòt nan bagay sa yo.
 Se konsa, franchman, abi a mwen te soufri kòm yon timoun te inyore pa sistèm lan.
 Pati nan li se ke mwen pa vle patisipe, yon anpil nan bagay sa yo ak moun ki gen rezon yo, men nan pwòp eksperyans mwen, 51A nan premye, se yon plent sou abi sou timoun,
 Mwen mansyone l ', e mwen panse li te kapab di li nan klas jadendanfan.
 Mwen te anvi pou volonte mwen lè mwen te gen 14 zan.
 Se konsa, si ou panse sou ki jan konplike li se, abi sou timoun ak bagay sa yo vin konplike pa lang, nan povrete ak tout bagay sa yo tou.
 Se konsa, nou gen yon anpil nan timoun isit la nan Medford, nan vil sa a bèl
 Valè byen imobilye kite tab la epi nou toujou gen timoun sa yo
 Li nan kòm mal nouri kòm Lawrence ak I.
 Moun yo ap gade m 'tankou yon bagay k ap pase.
 Nou pa ka wè kiyès timoun sa yo ye.
 Nou pa konnen lè yo ap gade yo tankou timoun ki pa te resevwa manje oswa abi oswa nenpòt ki lòt timoun.
 Men, tout sa mwen vle di se yon ka nan ti gason ak yon ka nan ti fi ap eseye CSA.
 Li te di youn nan dis timoun yo se estatistik.
 Mwen panse ke timoun yo se vre pi wo, men yo anjeneral pa rapòte li.
 Men, estatistik sa yo se vre trè wo.
 Se konsa, si yon ka nan ti fi yo te eseye CSA ak youn nan uit oswa dis nan ti gason gen yon sèl, konbyen pedofili li genyen?
 Ok
 Wi.
 Frèt, wi.
 Wow.
 Mwen konnen li entans.
 Se konsa, nou te fini ak yon klas kè kontan.
 Ki jan nou transfere li nan nòt kè kontan?
 Mwen pa gen okenn lide.
 Ann wè.
 Oke, fason nou te deplase li nan yon klas kè kontan se ke gen yon anpil nan defansè nan vil la.
 Gen anpil moun ki vle fè sa ki bon pou pitit yo.
 Gen anpil bon moun nan vil sa a.
 Mwen ankouraje w gade pi lwen, ou konnen, toujou parèt nan reyinyon yo, ou konnen,
 Li te panse a ki jan nou konekte timoun sa yo ak timoun ki pa t '.
 Nou gen yon gwo kominote kreyòl ayisyen.
 Nou gen yon gwo kominote pale Pòtigè.
 Nou gen plizyè lojman piblik nan vil la.
 Wi, sa a se etonan.
 Danyèl se ironik.
 Mwen sonje lè timoun mwen yo te nan lekòl la, mwen ta zanmi timoun mwen yo.
 Ou konnen, sa ka nan otorite lojman yo.
 Mwen pral panse, mwen pral envite yo epi kite yo vini, kèlkeswa sa.
 Yo pral panse, non, mwen pa pral envite yo, manman an.
 Mwen renmen, ki sa ou ap pale de?
 Yo ta panse, mwen santi mwen wont pou envite yo nan kay nou an.
 Mwen panse, kisa?
 Danielle, sa a se eksperyans nan etranj.
 Yo te wont envite yo nan kay nou paske nou te gen yon bèl kay paske yo ta ka panse ke nou te rich.
 Mwen te panse, li te ironik, dwa?
 Jis tankou ironi a mwen te bay pandan tout lavi mwen.
 Mwen te panse, ki sa?
 Ki jan fou li se, men li se vre.
 Tankou, ou ka santi w alèz nan pwòp anviwònman ou ak bliye ke sa a k ap pase, yo konnen, li la reyèl, timoun sa yo ap pase nan li, epi nou yo fòse yo ede.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00112&t=3515.721s">[Danielle Balocca]</a>: Wi, mwen panse ke bon nouvèl la se ke podcast la ke yo te lage.
 Mwen panse ke mwen te avèk ou pou plizyè ane epi w ap reyèlman ap eseye jwenn li soti ak li te finalman soti.
 Ou mansyone Harvard yon fwa kèk e mwen ta di sou Harvard ke yo te fè yon bon travay oswa mwen vle di, mwen pa konnen, li nan yon bon travay, men yo
 Gen yon sistèm kote elèv yo rapòte chòk seksyèl, dwa?
 Kòm mwen panse ke anpil lekòl evite sa a paske, si nou reyalize ke pwoblèm nan se yon pwoblèm, nou bezwen reyalize ke li se yon pwoblèm, dwa?
 Travay la nan Harvard ak sa mwen panse ke ou fè nan sa a podcast se tankou ajoute non nan bagay sa yo ak pran yo ale pou nou ka rekonèt yo ak Lè sa a, nou ka ede li.
 Ede fè fas ak li, dwa?
 Wi, se de tout fason.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00112&t=3558.259s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Lè ou inyore tèt ou, sa se tout bagay.
 Men, mwen di tou Harvard te fè sa paske yo te trete plizyè fwa.
 Se konsa, demann lan ka chanje, dwa?
 Demann kreye chanjman sistemik.
 Ah, reyèlman?
 Se sa ou konnen, oke, ki jan ou kreye chanjman?
 Malerezman, li sanble yo dwe bezwen yo, li nan lwa a, ou konnen, li nan chanje li.
 Men, gen anpil fason diferan fè li.
 Men, anjeneral, menm sitiyasyon an tankou nan lane 1970 yo.
 Kisa ki te pase?
 Poukisa tout bagay sa yo
 Franchman, pònografi timoun ak pedofili kraze nan tout peyi a nan lane 1978.
 Oke, sa rive paske gen anpil timoun ki manke nan tout peyi a.
 Se konsa, yo atire yon odyans Kongrè a ak te fè lwa yo.
 Premye lwa eksplwatasyon seksyèl timoun lan te fòme nan lane 1978.
 Lè sa a, gen sant nasyonal pou manke ak eksplore timoun yo
 Li te fonde an 1984.
 Nan istwa sant nasyonal la, yo ta di ke yo te kreye akòz anpil ka timoun ki manke yo.
 Yo ta di ke akòz anpil ka ki manke timoun yo atravè peyi a, yo te kreye.
 Mwen te mande youn nan travayè sosyal Andy pou di mwen ke timoun ki te disparèt jouk jòdi a se deseni ki pi wo nan istwa modèn nan lane 1970 yo.
 Dapre revizyon nou an, pesonn pa ka gade dèyè, nou ka wè sa a ak wè sa ki done sa a se?
 Mwen vle di, mwen ta renmen wè yon enstitisyon ki fè fè
 Ka etid, sou rechèch la enstitisyonèl ki endistri a aktyèlman ki dwe nan, endistri sa a $ 1 milya dola ki afekte rezilta sa yo.
 Men, sa a se yon lòt konvèsasyon nan yon lòt jou.
 Nou pa pral lanse yon lòt podcast nan li, men mwen vle moun yo tande li.
 Ou ka jwenn nou, sit entènèt nou an se OpenInviopodcast.com.
 Ou ka jwenn nou nenpòt kote ou tande.
 Kòm mwen te di, nou te resevwa prèske 200 kritik soti nan senk zetwal yo
 Epi, si ou li revize ak kòmantè, ou pral tande poukisa.
 Sa a se yon reyalite ki baze sou ak done ki baze sou podcast, men li tou te gen kè, senpati yo ak pasyon.
 Se konsa, mwen panse sa a ede.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00112&t=3691.821s">[Danielle Balocca]</a>: Wi, li te fè byen.
 Tankou, ou konnen, koute lou ak trè bon kontni.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00112&t=3697.205s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Mwen konnen.
 Se konsa, li trè kirye paske gen kèk moun ki di li nan, mizik la se reyèlman gwo.
 Apre sa, mwen panse ke yon moun te ekri nan kritik podcast Apple la oswa yon bagay, tankou si li te kapab tande sa a mèt, ou konnen, pou tout tan, vwa ou oswa pou tout tan.
 Mwen panse, etranj, lè ou pale, ou konnen ki sa mwen vle di?
 Ki jan, men se vre.
 Men, mwen panse ke sa ka konpanse.
 Ou konnen, ou ta ka bezwen yon vwa rilaks di istwa sa yo terib.
 Epi, si gen sivivan, Danielle, mwen jis vle di, ou konnen, ou pa pou kont ou.
 Nou kwè nan ou.
 Ou konnen, gen yon peyi kote abi seksyèl dirèk se Rennes.
 Apre sa, mwen pa gen nimewo a devan m ', men mwen panse ke li nan 1-800-656.
 Men, petèt mwen ka enkli li yon pati nan li isit la.
 Wi.
 Epi, ou konnen, kò a kenbe ki fè nòt ak chòk la se toujou avèk nou.
 Men, ou konnen, mwen renmen li, mwen panse ke li nan yon nominasyon ak mwen pa sonje ki moun li ye, men ou ka ede m 'tou.
 Men, mwen renmen li, ou konnen, mond lan se tout doulè, men li se tou plen simonte.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00112&t=3759.563s">[Danielle Balocca]</a>: Sa a se yon bon kote pou fini.
 Mèsi, Melanie.
