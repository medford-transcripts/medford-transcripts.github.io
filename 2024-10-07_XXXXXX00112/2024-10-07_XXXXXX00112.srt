00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:10,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:11,073 --> 00:00:11,573
[SPEAKER_02]: And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,254 --> 00:00:17,995
[SPEAKER_00]: And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:20,356
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,617 --> 00:00:28,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:34,902
[SPEAKER_02]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:37,544 --> 00:00:39,246
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thanks for being here with me today.

10
00:00:39,286 --> 00:00:43,529
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could just introduce yourself with your name, pronouns, and a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:44,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

12
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:47,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just click OK that it's being recorded.

13
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:54,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my name is Melanie Perkins McLaughlin, and my pronouns are she, her, hers.

14
00:00:56,483 --> 00:00:56,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

15
00:00:56,703 --> 00:00:57,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Melanie.

16
00:00:57,264 --> 00:01:05,610
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll ask you just our same question that you have answered a few times already, but maybe it's updated with all the new kind of restaurants we're seeing in Medford.

17
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,972
[SPEAKER_02]: But what is your favorite place to eat in Medford?

18
00:01:08,012 --> 00:01:08,832
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you like to eat there?

19
00:01:10,113 --> 00:01:22,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's funny because we don't get off and it's funny because we don't get out often enough, and it's not one of the newer restaurants, but honestly, we love Amici's in West Medford.

20
00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:23,103
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to tell you,

21
00:01:23,902 --> 00:01:36,726
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons that we love Amici so much besides their delicious pizza and great chicken Caesar salad is they are so inclusive of our daughter with intellectual and developmental disabilities, Gracie.

22
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:40,687
[SPEAKER_01]: They just make Gracie and her friends feel so welcome there.

23
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,008
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always talking with her.

24
00:01:43,068 --> 00:01:47,889
[SPEAKER_01]: She feels like, you know, she's part of the community when she goes there and that's a huge plus for us.

25
00:01:48,996 --> 00:01:49,416
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

26
00:01:49,436 --> 00:01:55,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we like to stop there and know that soccer practices at playstead and hope that they have slices for the day.

27
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:55,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.

28
00:01:55,562 --> 00:01:56,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

29
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I maybe saw your holiday card up there one time, too.

30
00:01:58,984 --> 00:01:59,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.

31
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:01,787
[SPEAKER_01]: He used to put my campaign, you know, stuff in the window.

32
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:02,647
[SPEAKER_01]: He's great, Mario.

33
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:06,971
[SPEAKER_01]: And also Mario is a dead ringer, in my opinion, for Robert De Niro.

34
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:08,993
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, bonus with your pizza, you get a.

35
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Robert De Niro lookalike.

36
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:12,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

37
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:13,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.

38
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:17,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And you did mention, you mentioned this, so I want to make sure to mention it too.

39
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:25,009
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I think in the past we've had you on the podcast to talk about school committee and, you know, just wanted to make sure that we thank you for your service.

40
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:29,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's not, it's not a role that you're currently in, but, you know, thank you for all that you've done.

41
00:02:29,892 --> 00:02:36,857
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a big part of that I noticed about your role was to your dedication to kind of the more vulnerable children in our community.

42
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:44,943
[SPEAKER_02]: and I do think there's maybe a connection to what we're going to talk about today with your podcast and the preceding documentary, Have You Seen Andy?

43
00:02:45,864 --> 00:02:54,851
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, hopefully you're going to continue to highlight the needs of the community's children just in a different way, and I'm sure same way you've been doing.

44
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:56,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, thank you.

45
00:02:56,653 --> 00:03:01,457
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your gratitude for the service and it is it is a service.

46
00:03:01,477 --> 00:03:06,822
[SPEAKER_01]: The job's hard and the people that are in those positions are doing it because they really do want to improve the community.

47
00:03:06,922 --> 00:03:16,690
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that even when you leave a role like that, you never really leave your heart still in the city and in the outcomes and invested in the outcomes.

48
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,292
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, my life

49
00:03:19,236 --> 00:03:24,021
[SPEAKER_01]: my life's work is advocacy and child advocacy and has been since I was a child myself.

50
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:29,807
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that doesn't change with whatever role I'm in, it's in all aspects of my life.

51
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:31,569
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will certainly continue.

52
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:42,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and something that I am really struck by in listening to your podcast and having watched the documentary is how dedicated you've been to the search for your childhood friend.

53
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:47,842
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't want to give too much away, but do you want to tell us a little bit about your podcast?

54
00:03:47,922 --> 00:03:48,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.

55
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:55,906
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew up in Lawrence, Massachusetts, which at the time was the 23rd poorest city in the country.

56
00:03:55,926 --> 00:03:59,909
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it's not much higher at this point or lower, however you look at it.

57
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:03,851
[SPEAKER_01]: the demographics are really marginalized population.

58
00:04:04,092 --> 00:04:12,117
[SPEAKER_01]: And of marginalized populations, the most marginalized are individuals like children or people with disabilities, right?

59
00:04:13,238 --> 00:04:22,805
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were children in this community that was already pretty marginalized growing up in a, what we called at the time, you know, projects, housing projects.

60
00:04:24,186 --> 00:04:26,988
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the words, just to be clear that I'm gonna use

61
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:29,871
[SPEAKER_01]: are very specific to the 1970s.

62
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:35,095
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll explain why that's important, but I'll also maybe use the contemporary word as well.

63
00:04:35,135 --> 00:04:41,540
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you don't understand the word and you don't have a lexicon, it kind of makes things more ambiguous.

64
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,902
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that'll come up a little bit in this, and you'll see why.

65
00:04:45,102 --> 00:04:48,285
[SPEAKER_01]: But Andy and I grew up in a housing project in Lawrence.

66
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:53,521
[SPEAKER_01]: And he moved in the March before he disappeared.

67
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:54,562
[SPEAKER_01]: He disappeared in August of 1976.

68
00:04:56,544 --> 00:05:03,269
[SPEAKER_01]: And a few years earlier, we had had a municipal pool built right across the street from the stadium projects.

69
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,952
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was a huge bonus for us.

70
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:07,713
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought that was the best thing ever.

71
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:10,235
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pretty much like our vacation.

72
00:05:10,255 --> 00:05:12,277
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us didn't get to take vacations.

73
00:05:12,357 --> 00:05:13,398
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were at the

74
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:15,645
[SPEAKER_01]: at the municipal pool every day.

75
00:05:15,685 --> 00:05:17,066
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was a gift really.

76
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:19,867
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great, great program, great project.

77
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:25,348
[SPEAKER_01]: And Andy's house, you could see the pool from his front door.

78
00:05:25,488 --> 00:05:34,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he was that close and the units were all like, they were six unit dwellings, like one building with six units in it straight across.

79
00:05:34,972 --> 00:05:36,233
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just all really knew each other.

80
00:05:36,273 --> 00:05:37,033
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a community.

81
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:42,697
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to say that for the kids, it was part stand by me and part Lord of the Flies.

82
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:46,058
[SPEAKER_01]: So people who know those movies and those books might get it.

83
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:50,101
[SPEAKER_01]: It sort of was, you know, nobody messes with us.

84
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:50,981
[SPEAKER_01]: We take care of each other.

85
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:55,444
[SPEAKER_01]: We have each other's backs, but also amongst each other, it was survival of the fittest, right?

86
00:05:55,484 --> 00:05:57,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we also had a pecking order.

87
00:05:58,473 --> 00:06:04,062
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, Andy moved in that March and he was my brother's friend, you know, initially.

88
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:08,870
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he and I, the first time I met, he was outside playing football.

89
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:11,986
[SPEAKER_01]: with my brother and I asked if I could play.

90
00:06:12,046 --> 00:06:16,828
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm the only girl with three older brothers and I was often being chewed away as a pest.

91
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:19,449
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't want, he didn't, my brother didn't want me to play.

92
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:25,091
[SPEAKER_01]: And Andy stopped the game and said that he wouldn't play unless I could play too, which I thought was super sweet.

93
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:29,573
[SPEAKER_01]: And I developed kind of an instant crush and he was already pretty cute.

94
00:06:29,793 --> 00:06:34,415
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he had like olive skin and just big brown eyes.

95
00:06:34,515 --> 00:06:36,736
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had like his hair is kind of,

96
00:06:37,304 --> 00:06:43,972
[SPEAKER_01]: over one of his eyes, floppy hair over one of his eyes and he'd like flip his head back to get it out of his eyes when he was talking to you.

97
00:06:44,052 --> 00:06:49,900
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was just, it was like that prepubescent crush that we have, I guess.

98
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:56,548
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started to become friends and we hung out even without my brother around and

99
00:06:57,407 --> 00:07:00,131
[SPEAKER_01]: little things like, you know, he was always taking care of his siblings.

100
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:04,378
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the oldest of five and he was very paternal in the family.

101
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:05,539
[SPEAKER_01]: His mom was a single mom.

102
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,103
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Andy would do a lot of the childcare.

103
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:12,470
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember one time he was handing cookies out to his siblings and

104
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:15,604
[SPEAKER_01]: after he had handed them all out to me.

105
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:22,271
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came back to me and offered me another cookie, which just like little things that kids do to show you that they like you.

106
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:26,455
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had gotten some walkie talkies right before he disappeared.

107
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:27,676
[SPEAKER_01]: His birthday was coming up.

108
00:07:27,716 --> 00:07:30,899
[SPEAKER_01]: He disappeared just a week and a half before his 11th birthday.

109
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,243
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went to the pool that Sunday.

110
00:07:35,283 --> 00:07:37,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember it was just super hot.

111
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunday in August before school was gonna start.

112
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:44,256
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of the last Sundays before school would start.

113
00:07:44,436 --> 00:07:48,799
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went to the pool and we had been hanging out and just swimming and swimming.

114
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,080
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're kids with a lot of energy.

115
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:58,525
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just would swim every chance we got and they would have breaks occasionally to just make us rest.

116
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:01,487
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they had a 10 minute whistle break or whatever.

117
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:08,172
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were all sitting together outside of the locker room and my brothers and his friend and Andy and me,

118
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:15,380
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just had this feeling that day that then I didn't know what it was, but today I do.

119
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,042
[SPEAKER_01]: It was intuition.

120
00:08:17,402 --> 00:08:19,944
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't want to walk home alone.

121
00:08:20,945 --> 00:08:23,487
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked Andy if he would walk home with me.

122
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:25,509
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said he didn't want to.

123
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:26,910
[SPEAKER_01]: He was going to stay at the pool longer.

124
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,532
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked my brother if he would walk home with me.

125
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:31,274
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said he didn't want to.

126
00:08:31,454 --> 00:08:35,037
[SPEAKER_01]: And I turned on my heel and said I was going to tell on him.

127
00:08:35,837 --> 00:08:42,880
[SPEAKER_01]: and walked out of the pool and my brother ended up deciding it would be better for him to walk me home.

128
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,081
[SPEAKER_01]: So he sort of jumped up and walked out with me.

129
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:51,743
[SPEAKER_01]: And literally all it took was crossing the street, crossing a little tiny project parking lot.

130
00:08:52,396 --> 00:08:57,021
[SPEAKER_01]: going past Andy's house and down a little tiny hill and my house was right there.

131
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:58,102
[SPEAKER_01]: My grandmother's was right there.

132
00:08:58,142 --> 00:09:00,124
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we were so close to the pool.

133
00:09:01,226 --> 00:09:06,812
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my brother and I went home and it was around late afternoon lunchtime.

134
00:09:06,832 --> 00:09:07,272
[SPEAKER_01]: We were hungry.

135
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:08,874
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason that I wanted to go home.

136
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:14,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had intended to come back to the pool, which I would normally do, but I think after,

137
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,282
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole morning I was tired, I didn't go back to the pool.

138
00:09:18,283 --> 00:09:27,969
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometime later, around five-ish or so, you know, people started asking, you know, if Andy's mother was looking for him because, you know, it was the free-range kid days, right?

139
00:09:27,989 --> 00:09:34,514
[SPEAKER_01]: You could go wherever all day long and nobody knew where the heck you were, but when it came to dinner time, you had to be home and that was just the rule.

140
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,941
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was dinnertime and Andy wasn't home.

141
00:09:37,001 --> 00:09:40,364
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we sort of heard whispers like, oh, Andy's in trouble.

142
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:41,764
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we didn't really think much of it.

143
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:53,973
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, went to sleep that night like any other night and ended up being woken up in the middle of the night, early morning hours with the police banging on the front door.

144
00:09:54,333 --> 00:10:03,259
[SPEAKER_01]: And my mother brought my brother, Jeff and I down to the kitchen table and they were asking us if we had been with Andy, when was the last time we had seen him?

145
00:10:05,193 --> 00:10:06,594
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it became real.

146
00:10:07,135 --> 00:10:14,883
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next day, probably later that day, Monday or maybe Tuesday, a search team was set up.

147
00:10:14,943 --> 00:10:21,770
[SPEAKER_01]: They set up like a CB radio trucker, 18 wheeler thing over at the stadium parking lot.

148
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,592
[SPEAKER_01]: The football stadium was right next to the project.

149
00:10:23,652 --> 00:10:27,295
[SPEAKER_01]: It was named after the stadium project was named after the football stadium.

150
00:10:28,222 --> 00:10:43,125
[SPEAKER_01]: So they set up a searching rescue team there and they had a lot of CB radio enthusiasts searching and, you know, the kids were searching and the parents were searching and you would hear helicopters and low flying planes and it was just complete.

151
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:51,335
[SPEAKER_01]: cacophony of sound and just surreal, and looking for Andy.

152
00:10:51,596 --> 00:10:54,738
[SPEAKER_01]: And just as quickly as all that started, it stopped.

153
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:59,681
[SPEAKER_01]: After just six days, they stopped looking.

154
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,484
[SPEAKER_01]: And for whatever reason, I don't know,

155
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:09,250
[SPEAKER_01]: none of it was explained to us children.

156
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,052
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no sort of sitting us down.

157
00:11:11,092 --> 00:11:13,555
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no school counseling.

158
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:14,656
[SPEAKER_01]: There was none of that back then.

159
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:17,619
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just sort of pretend nothing happened.

160
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:18,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Life is normal.

161
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:23,025
[SPEAKER_01]: We got these really ambiguous warnings like, you know,

162
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:31,865
[SPEAKER_01]: if somebody is asking you to look for their dog, don't help them, stay away from white vans, just like really ambiguous things.

163
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:35,326
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't know what was what.

164
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:39,648
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just remember being so heartbroken and just really bewildered by,

165
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,029
[SPEAKER_01]: how the search could stop.

166
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:54,372
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have this very vivid memory of standing outside of my unit in the projects underneath this tree that was like one of my favorite places.

167
00:11:55,292 --> 00:12:06,835
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was pondering this and I just, with all this conviction of a nine-year-old, I told myself and Andy that when I grew up, I would try to find him.

168
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:21,392
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realize now that that was super naive, but it was also sort of a moment in life when, you know, I guess my destiny was defined and I didn't realize it, you know, part of my destiny was defined and I didn't realize it.

169
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:30,454
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I went away to college and, you know, ended up, I mean, there was, there's a lot in between there, but, you know, I, I, I became a ward of the state.

170
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:31,575
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a foster kid as well.

171
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,855
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was a really marginalized kid and I can understand

172
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:38,452
[SPEAKER_01]: kids being in systems where they're further marginalized.

173
00:12:38,572 --> 00:12:51,094
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had that experience, but I was very fortunate to have an aunt that could take me in and she took me in and she nurtured me back to health and really helped get me back on my feet and sent me to college.

174
00:12:51,474 --> 00:12:54,075
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately when I was 18, she died.

175
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:54,975
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went with her when I was 14.

176
00:12:55,495 --> 00:12:57,276
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by the time I was 18, she passed away.

177
00:12:57,316 --> 00:13:02,857
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was on my own again, but I was able to finish college and I majored in human services and

178
00:13:04,036 --> 00:13:05,197
[SPEAKER_01]: communications media.

179
00:13:05,437 --> 00:13:21,751
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had an advisor, as I was talking about these dual majors and what I should do with them, suggest that I should make social justice documentaries, or social justice films.

180
00:13:21,771 --> 00:13:23,433
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, that's a good idea.

181
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:24,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll do that.

182
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:39,221
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got an internship at WGBH in Boston and I loved, I went to Fitchburg State undergrad and they were the only university at the time that required a full-time internship before you could graduate.

183
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:42,883
[SPEAKER_01]: So that really put me ahead of a lot of the more elite colleges.

184
00:13:42,983 --> 00:13:48,186
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up being hired by WGBH because I was the intern that was there every day and was working.

185
00:13:51,527 --> 00:14:01,570
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my first job, I was a production assistant there and then an associate producer and then became a segment producer and just sort of went up the chain.

186
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,631
[SPEAKER_01]: And after about 15 years of doing that, I decided it was time to make my own film.

187
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:07,712
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to make my own film.

188
00:14:09,773 --> 00:14:14,458
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been helping independent filmmakers and I thought I could be, you know, maybe I could do this as an independent.

189
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought long and hard about it.

190
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:28,555
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew seeing other independents and how they worked that if I was going to do this, it was going to have to be something that I would do whether I got paid for it or not, like that I would want to do whether I got paid for it or not.

191
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:31,154
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, what is that?

192
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:34,819
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe there were two or three things that I thought I would want to do.

193
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:38,022
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them was to find out what happened to Andy.

194
00:14:39,444 --> 00:14:44,830
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in 1998, I decided I would make a documentary about Andy, again, very naively.

195
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,073
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had some experience.

196
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:49,255
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew how to do research as an associate producer.

197
00:14:49,295 --> 00:14:49,736
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew how to

198
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:53,287
[SPEAKER_01]: coordinate my research and organize it and that sort of stuff.

199
00:14:53,307 --> 00:15:06,799
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first call I made was to Andy's mom and we talked and the first thing Andy's mother said to me on that phone call was, this is way bigger than you understand or that you can realize.

200
00:15:08,978 --> 00:15:28,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember at the time not quite knowing what that meant, but also thinking that maybe it was sort of the musings of a bereft mother that like, of course her child's disappearance is bigger than anything anyone could imagine, but I didn't realize that she wasn't talking just figuratively, she was speaking literally.

201
00:15:28,974 --> 00:15:31,796
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would find that out as the years went by.

202
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:36,940
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it took me probably, I don't know, five to seven years

203
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:46,803
[SPEAKER_01]: making that documentary, primarily self-funded with some seed money from WGBH, which was super helpful.

204
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:56,066
[SPEAKER_01]: And from friends that would do quid pro quo gigs, like my sound man and cameraman would trade services to do the shoots and stuff like that.

205
00:15:56,086 --> 00:15:56,726
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was great.

206
00:15:56,826 --> 00:16:02,929
[SPEAKER_01]: And after a while of working on it and getting it into good shape with a fantastic editor, Rachel Clark,

207
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:05,471
[SPEAKER_01]: we pitched it to HBO.

208
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:09,314
[SPEAKER_01]: We had pitched it to HBO very early and they were like, yeah, make it and then come back to us.

209
00:16:09,394 --> 00:16:15,059
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did and they didn't respond for a couple of months.

210
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:15,679
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that.

211
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,801
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally it was like Labor Day weekend.

212
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:21,144
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know what, I'm just gonna call them and essentially be like, do you want it or not?

213
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:22,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm gonna start shopping it elsewhere.

214
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, I promise we'll watch it this weekend.

215
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:30,232
[SPEAKER_01]: And on Monday they contacted me and said, you know, when can you come to New York?

216
00:16:31,538 --> 00:16:38,840
[SPEAKER_01]: So my editor and I flew out to New York and the head of HBO documentary, who was a legend in her own time, Sheila Nevins,

217
00:16:39,516 --> 00:16:43,639
[SPEAKER_01]: met with us with her team and spent four hours with us going over the film.

218
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:51,704
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember walking out that day and we didn't have a signed deal or anything, but we got outside of the building and I started jumping up and down.

219
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,345
[SPEAKER_01]: And my editor was like, what are you doing?

220
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:56,007
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh my God, HBO is going to take the film.

221
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:57,548
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, what are you talking about?

222
00:16:57,588 --> 00:17:02,111
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Sheila Nevins doesn't spend four hours with anybody if she's not going to take what they have.

223
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:09,739
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and bought what I considered to be an expensive pair of shoes, which was a hundred dollars at the time, a hundred dollar pair of shoes.

224
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was my treat to myself.

225
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:19,545
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were off, you know, when we made this documentary and it was so validating and it was so important and it was such hard work.

226
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:22,527
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I should have been in therapy when I was doing it.

227
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:29,252
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't, instead I was raising, you know, birthing and raising two kids and doing all these things, but it was a really hard film to make.

228
00:17:31,657 --> 00:17:33,978
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the day that it broadcast, it was June, 2007.

229
00:17:34,278 --> 00:17:39,941
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had asked, HBO had asked if we wanted a party in New York or California.

230
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:41,701
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, no, I want a party in Lawrence.

231
00:17:41,962 --> 00:17:45,523
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had it at the theater that Andy and I used to go to as kids.

232
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:50,405
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember the night that it was shown, it was like 400 people, the theater was packed.

233
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:56,588
[SPEAKER_01]: It was people from kindergarten to college and, you know, everywhere in between and Andy's family, of course.

234
00:17:57,307 --> 00:18:02,350
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the important people that matter to me to hear this story, this communal tragedy, right?

235
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:08,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was also all the kids I had grown up with who never really knew what happened and would be able to see this, you know?

236
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:17,000
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember taking a moment and looking out at this audience and thinking, oh my God, like, what am I gonna do next that's gonna feel this important?

237
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:21,383
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, which is kind of was a character flaw of my own at the time.

238
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:27,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of just being able to be in the moment and just enjoy this accomplishment, it was like, okay, what's next?

239
00:18:27,655 --> 00:18:29,235
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm getting better at that.

240
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,377
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would find out what was next.

241
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:34,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Six months later, I was pregnant.

242
00:18:34,637 --> 00:18:36,518
[SPEAKER_01]: I would find out that I was pregnant with our third child.

243
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:44,072
[SPEAKER_01]: who we would learn prenatally had down syndrome and a congenital heart defect and would require open heart surgery after she was born.

244
00:18:44,132 --> 00:18:47,976
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the film came out in June and Gracie was born in December.

245
00:18:48,237 --> 00:18:53,102
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, I got my answer pretty quickly from the universe about what I was doing next.

246
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:54,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

247
00:18:54,668 --> 00:19:12,896
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I took 10 years of caring for my family and learning about disability and becoming a disability advocate and, you know, taking a year long fellowship and, you know, just all of the things that I did, you know, advocating for her in school and all of those things during that 10 years.

248
00:19:13,176 --> 00:19:22,520
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say that I was a child advocate from the time I was a child because I did, you know, go into DSS of my own volition, like I wanted to leave

249
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:27,505
[SPEAKER_01]: what have you, but Gracie professionalized my advocacy.

250
00:19:28,887 --> 00:19:41,457
[SPEAKER_01]: She gave me a masterclass in advocacy, and I learned how to truly become a child advocate and how to build relationships to create effective systemic change.

251
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:50,919
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up deciding to go to Harvard to get a master's in education policy, because again, I wanna change systems for marginalized kids.

252
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,461
[SPEAKER_01]: And the movement was going a little too slow for me.

253
00:19:55,041 --> 00:20:00,684
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought maybe if I could just get a master's at Harvard with the mentor who does inclusive education, I'd be able to fix it all.

254
00:20:01,705 --> 00:20:05,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Which again, I don't know, I always look back at how naive I was at all these things.

255
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:10,890
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I hope I'm not as naive as I was, but I'm sure I'll look back years from now and think the same.

256
00:20:12,627 --> 00:20:16,469
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up getting a master's at Harvard and it was 2017.

257
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:18,250
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of things were happening that year.

258
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,531
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the Me Too movement.

259
00:20:22,952 --> 00:20:32,056
[SPEAKER_01]: I had learned about adverse childhood experience study, ACEs, and how childhood trauma affects our outcomes in our life.

260
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:37,439
[SPEAKER_01]: And was having a lot of that experience myself and was recognizing it in myself.

261
00:20:38,477 --> 00:20:42,161
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Me Too movement was triggering a lot of that as well.

262
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:55,273
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, one day I was driving down the street and listening to NPR and on the radio came this story about how the FBI were digging in the backyard of a man in Georgetown, Mass.

263
00:20:55,533 --> 00:21:01,199
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were allegedly looking for a child, a victim of homicide.

264
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:01,279
[SPEAKER_01]: And

265
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:07,724
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been trying to get the police to listen to that story for 10 years.

266
00:21:09,004 --> 00:21:20,446
[SPEAKER_01]: The victim who had gone to the police 10 years earlier, one of the alleged victims of this man who said he witnessed this child murder had come to me shortly after he had seen the film.

267
00:21:20,506 --> 00:21:23,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect the film probably triggered some things for him.

268
00:21:23,646 --> 00:21:31,248
[SPEAKER_01]: He came to me and was exploring because he was trying to find out who the child might be that he said he had witnessed the murder of.

269
00:21:32,308 --> 00:21:32,508
[SPEAKER_01]: And I,

270
00:21:33,937 --> 00:21:41,460
[SPEAKER_01]: advocated for him and tried to get him in touch with state police and local police and others, you know, the attorney general's office and others.

271
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:47,542
[SPEAKER_01]: And people, you know, for the most part just sort of pushed him along.

272
00:21:47,743 --> 00:21:54,405
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of it was because he had his own trauma and, you know, he had some things going on.

273
00:21:54,425 --> 00:22:00,828
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think for some of law enforcement that discredited him or, you know, in their eyes and,

274
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:02,628
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the opposite.

275
00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:13,891
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that when we find people who have that kind of trauma that say that they've witnessed these kinds of things, it's usually evidence that they did witness these kinds of things, as opposed to otherwise.

276
00:22:14,652 --> 00:22:17,712
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was sort of not seen as credible in their eyes for a long time.

277
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:19,513
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the

278
00:22:19,997 --> 00:22:30,765
[SPEAKER_01]: this man that he had accused had passed away and the police had to go into his home for a check to rule out foul play, which was just standard procedure in Massachusetts if someone dies in their home.

279
00:22:31,206 --> 00:22:34,928
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they went into this man's house, they saw all kinds of incriminating evidence.

280
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:42,194
[SPEAKER_01]: There were boy mannequins dressed up in soccer uniforms, and there were hundreds of identifications of children.

281
00:22:42,674 --> 00:22:46,237
[SPEAKER_01]: This man had been a soccer coach for years in Beverly and Averill.

282
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:54,499
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think Georgetown and all sorts of videotapes with questionable titles on them.

283
00:22:54,579 --> 00:23:02,428
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just, it was, it reminded me, I've seen some of the pictures and honestly, it reminded me of like the scene in Silence of the Lambs when you see Buffalo Bill's house, right?

284
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:03,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it literally looked like that.

285
00:23:03,729 --> 00:23:08,014
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like, and I think they were like, uh-oh, we should have paid attention to that victim.

286
00:23:08,914 --> 00:23:11,896
[SPEAKER_01]: who they refer to as witness X, who I refer to as witness X or whatever.

287
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:31,165
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was driving down the road and I was triggered by this trauma and I came home and I recognized the trauma trigger, thankfully, but I came home and I pulled out all of my material from the documentary and the police reports and the files and the tapes and everything out of my closet.

288
00:23:31,185 --> 00:23:36,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was sitting in the middle of this pile of stuff

289
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,564
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, what do I do with this?

290
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:51,296
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew when I was finishing Andy's documentary that instead of coming to a conclusion, I was coming to another chapter in the story, but I had to stop at that point.

291
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:52,217
[SPEAKER_01]: The film was due.

292
00:23:52,478 --> 00:23:55,601
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think also life was calling me to do other things.

293
00:23:55,681 --> 00:23:59,345
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, I'm grateful that I stopped at that point, because I think had I kept going,

294
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:04,048
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably would not have, my mental health probably wouldn't have survived.

295
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:10,733
[SPEAKER_01]: So I needed that break and I needed that time to become trauma informed really, and to be able to put supports in place before I could go back into it.

296
00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:14,676
[SPEAKER_01]: But in 2017, I decided, all right, I'm going back in.

297
00:24:14,716 --> 00:24:21,341
[SPEAKER_01]: I liken it to that scene in the Godfather with Michael Corleone, when he's like, every time I try to get out, they pull me back in.

298
00:24:21,421 --> 00:24:23,903
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, like, that's how trauma is, right?

299
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:26,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every time you think you're out, you get pulled back in.

300
00:24:27,285 --> 00:24:29,347
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way that I,

301
00:24:30,103 --> 00:24:37,373
[SPEAKER_01]: cope with my own childhood trauma is through advocacy and through truth telling.

302
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:44,062
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't realize that that's actually a very effective way to cope with trauma.

303
00:24:44,122 --> 00:24:47,267
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I have a trauma expert that's on my podcast.

304
00:24:47,993 --> 00:24:54,598
[SPEAKER_01]: and she just wrote a book, her name is Judy Herman, and she just wrote a book called Truth and Repair.

305
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Her second book, yeah, at 84.

306
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,221
[SPEAKER_01]: After a long time of.

307
00:25:02,064 --> 00:25:03,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Her own trauma, she was in a lot of pain.

308
00:25:03,746 --> 00:25:06,788
[SPEAKER_01]: She had an accident, was in a lot of pain, and had to derail her career for a while.

309
00:25:07,389 --> 00:25:08,910
[SPEAKER_01]: But at 84, she just wrote her second book.

310
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,592
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's considered the mother of trauma.

311
00:25:11,253 --> 00:25:13,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Her and Bessel van der Kolk started out together.

312
00:25:13,154 --> 00:25:15,236
[SPEAKER_01]: He's sort of, I guess, the father of trauma, if you would say it.

313
00:25:15,737 --> 00:25:17,098
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were the ones who named trauma.

314
00:25:17,118 --> 00:25:24,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of naming things, there wasn't a name for trauma in the 90s, and they named, or if there was, it was PTSD, and it was very specific to veterans.

315
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:27,908
[SPEAKER_01]: And Judy Carmen named trauma

316
00:25:28,557 --> 00:25:31,841
[SPEAKER_01]: as being something that's also in our homes and in our lives.

317
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:40,211
[SPEAKER_01]: And her and Bessel, who wrote The Body Keeps the Score, Bessel van der Kolk, just changed the landscape for trauma survivors.

318
00:25:40,591 --> 00:25:45,737
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I interviewed Judy, she was amazing, because she said she did a lot of work on incest.

319
00:25:46,873 --> 00:25:51,735
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, you know, the data at that point was saying that, you know, incest survivors were 2 million to one.

320
00:25:52,195 --> 00:25:56,976
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, and I got my doctorate from Harvard and I set up my shingle and I, you know, started my private practice.

321
00:25:57,377 --> 00:26:00,798
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, and in that very week, I had three incest survivors come in to see me.

322
00:26:00,818 --> 00:26:02,718
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, there's something wrong with the data.

323
00:26:03,819 --> 00:26:05,039
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, she knew.

324
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:09,841
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she wrote, she specialized in that and she wrote a book back then.

325
00:26:12,513 --> 00:26:14,855
[SPEAKER_01]: of trauma and resilience.

326
00:26:15,095 --> 00:26:16,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, trauma and recovery, right.

327
00:26:16,636 --> 00:26:17,997
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 84 is truth and repair.

328
00:26:18,418 --> 00:26:24,903
[SPEAKER_01]: And her book, truth and repair was really, you know, a revelation to me as I read it, because what she talks about in this book is that

329
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:31,556
[SPEAKER_01]: we heal trauma through advocacy and through empowerment.

330
00:26:32,136 --> 00:26:35,500
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way that that happens is that it has to be supported by community.

331
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:41,906
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to have upstanders in our community who are willing to support the truth and allow for the advocacy.

332
00:26:42,687 --> 00:26:48,830
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the empowerment and the healing can happen, which was really a big deal, is really a big deal for me.

333
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:52,051
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really was like, oh my God, this is the whole purpose of this podcast.

334
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:54,592
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some ways it's been like the whole purpose of my life.

335
00:26:55,433 --> 00:26:57,874
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bessel's book had that same effect on me.

336
00:26:57,914 --> 00:27:11,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I read Bessel's book on, you know, the body keeps the score and I was blown away by how much it related to my life and to the life of so many people I know and so many people who don't know about ACEs and childhood trauma and trauma in general.

337
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:21,908
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided the cost effective way for me to do this and tell this story and do a deeper dive would be to do a podcast.

338
00:27:22,268 --> 00:27:30,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my experience was in documentary filmmaking and it's quite expensive, you know, and it's a lot of work and you have to have a lot of crew and there's just a lot.

339
00:27:30,614 --> 00:27:33,517
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, okay, you know, I like this new genre.

340
00:27:33,577 --> 00:27:35,538
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a deep dive into materials.

341
00:27:35,578 --> 00:27:40,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been listening to a couple of podcasts that really affected me, like Barebrook and

342
00:27:42,582 --> 00:27:44,183
[SPEAKER_01]: crime town and just a few.

343
00:27:44,283 --> 00:27:52,128
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, so I started to, to listen to them and to basically educate myself and try to learn how to, to make them.

344
00:27:52,228 --> 00:27:56,671
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, but I've been working on this project sort of off and on since 2017.

345
00:27:57,471 --> 00:28:02,914
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, you know, with the help of a lot of people, just to be clear, nobody does this work alone.

346
00:28:03,175 --> 00:28:11,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have an incredible composer who I think just really brings the stories to life and editor and, you know, coordinating producer who's really helped me to,

347
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,881
[SPEAKER_01]: just understand what the FRSS feed is and how to get it loaded.

348
00:28:17,121 --> 00:28:23,223
[SPEAKER_01]: But just like basic things and just a great team, researchers both volunteer and paid that have come up along the line.

349
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,143
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is tough work.

350
00:28:24,183 --> 00:28:31,685
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is hard work looking at unsolved missing and murdered children's cases and really looking at them.

351
00:28:31,725 --> 00:28:33,205
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had this hypothesis that

352
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,822
[SPEAKER_01]: While I was at Harvard, I had to take a statistics class.

353
00:28:38,303 --> 00:28:45,993
[SPEAKER_01]: And speaking of data, and Judy's story about data and the two million to one, I had to take a statistics class.

354
00:28:46,093 --> 00:28:51,380
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I was contemplating this idea, I had to tell this story again, I thought,

355
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:55,051
[SPEAKER_01]: why not use data to tell this story?

356
00:28:55,111 --> 00:28:59,754
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had so many people sort of be disbelieving in where my research has been leading me.

357
00:28:59,874 --> 00:29:05,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't I use qualitative and quantitative data and prove what I'm finding?

358
00:29:05,217 --> 00:29:06,538
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I did.

359
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:07,799
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a hypothesis that perhaps

360
00:29:13,548 --> 00:29:21,473
[SPEAKER_01]: murdered children, recovered homicide victims from the 1970s might be able to inform missing children's cases.

361
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:25,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I thought before this, I thought Andy's case was an anomaly.

362
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:27,937
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I started to research through the film,

363
00:29:28,697 --> 00:29:41,695
[SPEAKER_01]: And otherwise, I found that Andy's case wasn't an anomaly, that Andy was one of several children who went missing in Massachusetts in the 1970s, and that it was far more common than, frankly, any of us realized.

364
00:29:42,736 --> 00:29:43,638
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to know why.

365
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:46,822
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wanted to see if the same was true with homicide.

366
00:29:46,862 --> 00:29:58,077
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up, you know, getting vital statistics from DPH and, you know, all deaths, zero to 19, and then finding out about how they code deaths, you know, deaths and, you know, disaggregating homicide data.

367
00:29:58,197 --> 00:30:00,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I started, you know, putting together this data and it really,

368
00:30:01,936 --> 00:30:06,499
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion, it really supports the hypothesis.

369
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:12,423
[SPEAKER_01]: There are dozens of unsolved missing and murdered children's cases from the 1970s, unsolved.

370
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:15,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started to dig into those cases as well.

371
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:19,387
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started to bring my research to law enforcement.

372
00:30:19,447 --> 00:30:20,888
[SPEAKER_01]: I would meet with district attorneys.

373
00:30:20,968 --> 00:30:26,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I met with the attorney general and anybody, frankly, that would listen to say, look it, something was going on in the 70s.

374
00:30:26,612 --> 00:30:28,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this data doesn't,

375
00:30:29,425 --> 00:30:31,986
[SPEAKER_01]: make, you know, it adds up to something more.

376
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:39,930
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and several of the victims also had, were, you know, the homicide victims had died in the same manner, you know, and again, they were all unsolved.

377
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,111
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still all unsolved.

378
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:41,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

379
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:43,412
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this was a big deal.

380
00:30:43,732 --> 00:30:48,435
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so I just was doing the data and making the podcast and,

381
00:30:49,575 --> 00:31:02,326
[SPEAKER_01]: In September, on September 7th of this year, finally, the day after, well, yeah, close to the day after Andy's birthday, we launched the podcast.

382
00:31:02,366 --> 00:31:14,856
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one, it's an eight-part investigative series that is looking at the unsolved missing and murdered children's cases in Massachusetts in the 1970s.

383
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:28,898
[SPEAKER_01]: the history of human trafficking of children in Massachusetts and across the country, which is a big and heavy topic.

384
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:34,762
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, getting to the vocabulary thing, there wasn't even a name for it back then.

385
00:31:36,303 --> 00:31:37,844
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no word human trafficking.

386
00:31:38,345 --> 00:31:40,506
[SPEAKER_01]: That didn't come into the lexicon until the 90s.

387
00:31:41,727 --> 00:31:45,950
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, like we say in the podcast too, there was no word for pedophile.

388
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:49,981
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't even a regular word.

389
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:54,363
[SPEAKER_01]: And children were to be seen and not heard.

390
00:31:55,224 --> 00:31:57,385
[SPEAKER_01]: They were rarely, if ever, believed.

391
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:07,972
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly poor and marginalized children who might accuse or have been abused by

392
00:32:08,785 --> 00:32:13,210
[SPEAKER_01]: wealthy or privileged men would not be believed.

393
00:32:13,611 --> 00:32:28,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we all know now, in 2001, the Boston Globe broke the clergy abuse scandal in Spotlight and the famous movie Spotlight, which also won an Academy Award, the Boston Globe won a Pulitzer,

394
00:32:30,588 --> 00:32:41,351
[SPEAKER_01]: movie won an Academy Award and it revealed this whole culture of clergy sex abuse in Massachusetts in the 1970s, but not just Massachusetts, right?

395
00:32:41,371 --> 00:32:43,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Around the country, around the world.

396
00:32:43,552 --> 00:32:48,974
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the final title card in that film is just like the listing of all the different places that this was happening.

397
00:32:49,954 --> 00:32:59,737
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, I don't see how anyone could watch that film or read these series and think that these are one bad apple.

398
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:08,739
[SPEAKER_01]: that this is just one incidence of one priest in one parish that was doing this to, you know, X amount of children.

399
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:15,988
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this was a culture and climate of systemic child sex abuse.

400
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,852
[SPEAKER_01]: And people don't like to talk about that.

401
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:26,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I think that was a very comprehensive story.

402
00:33:26,451 --> 00:33:30,655
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like childhood, you went through a lot of trauma, right?

403
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:35,521
[SPEAKER_02]: And that you came up with something to tell yourself to get through that, which is like, I'm going to look into this.

404
00:33:35,561 --> 00:33:36,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to find Andy.

405
00:33:37,122 --> 00:33:39,044
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's something

406
00:33:40,315 --> 00:33:47,981
[SPEAKER_02]: turned into a whole, like, you know, a whole much, like a much bigger project and much different outcomes.

407
00:33:48,281 --> 00:34:00,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think in my, professionally, I work at a rape crisis center, and we, you know, with victims of and survivors of sexual trauma, and what you're saying about, like, justice,

408
00:34:01,652 --> 00:34:08,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's like we have this idea that if these things are happening, the criminal legal system is going to take care of them.

409
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:09,959
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just not the case, right?

410
00:34:09,979 --> 00:34:19,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we take for granted that maybe the criminal legal system is set up in such a way that it's going to prioritize not the needs of the vulnerable, but the needs of those in power.

411
00:34:22,675 --> 00:34:29,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, you know, it sounds like the messages that the children in your life are receiving at the time when you were a child were that you're not important.

412
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:30,982
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to look into this.

413
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:34,765
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to spend six days like, you know, caring about this and then we're going to move on.

414
00:34:35,445 --> 00:34:47,675
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, the work it sounds like the work that you're doing now is coming up with a way to, you know, show your your past self, but also all the other kids and vulnerable people that they do matter and that their lives are

415
00:34:48,335 --> 00:34:58,440
[SPEAKER_02]: worth looking into and you know one thing that that stuck with me from Judith Herman's new book is like You know, it's not necessarily about Punishing the perpetrators.

416
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:10,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, we don't you know, we don't want them to continue doing what they're doing, but it's like this idea that People should be believed and that what happened to them is important and that you know, we don't want that to continue happening and

417
00:35:11,463 --> 00:35:22,666
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like it sounds like this documentary, your documentary and the podcast are really, you know, I've been struck, you know, at least I look like I listen to folks like talk about their trauma every day.

418
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:33,449
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first episode, when you play like the tapes of that pedophile, like talking about his talking about young boys was like deeply disturbing.

419
00:35:33,649 --> 00:35:35,490
[SPEAKER_02]: And also like that's the reality, right?

420
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a

421
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:41,494
[SPEAKER_02]: these are important things for us to talk about because they're happening, right?

422
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,334
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't ignore them.

423
00:35:44,396 --> 00:35:59,648
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I guess- Yeah, that's a big part of it, Danielle, is I sometimes hear from people, in the one sense, well, first of all, you just gave me chills with what you said, because the most important thing, the most important thing anyone can say to a survivor is, I believe you.

424
00:36:01,695 --> 00:36:09,523
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll never forget, you know, when I was bringing this to bringing attention to these cases and these issues.

425
00:36:09,563 --> 00:36:15,590
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, you know, again, I had, you know, yeah, I grew up in the projects and I was from Lawrence and I'm, you know, proud of that fact.

426
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,492
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, it's, it taught me a lot.

427
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:18,252
[SPEAKER_01]: And

428
00:36:18,953 --> 00:36:20,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I also won an Emmy and went to Harvard, right?

429
00:36:21,195 --> 00:36:36,665
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I have a little bit of whatever, even if I have credibility, in my opinion, from growing up in the projects, my street cred and all the things that I survived and everything else, I love that part of me and that's a huge part of my advocacy.

430
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:43,310
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also went these other routes to be able to quote unquote prove myself, right?

431
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,092
[SPEAKER_01]: So that maybe I could have this quote unquote credibility, right?

432
00:36:46,112 --> 00:36:46,973
[SPEAKER_01]: And people would believe

433
00:36:47,533 --> 00:36:50,496
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever the mass media that I was trying to get it out, right?

434
00:36:50,656 --> 00:36:55,760
[SPEAKER_01]: And the truth is that even with those credentials, I would still get dismissed.

435
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,923
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had been going to people like, oh my God, you're not gonna believe this.

436
00:36:59,963 --> 00:37:05,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have some materials that are just really, frankly, mind blowing that people would just not believe.

437
00:37:05,648 --> 00:37:11,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the court documents or police records I have that I'm just still stunned by them.

438
00:37:12,074 --> 00:37:13,875
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're such incredible stories.

439
00:37:14,015 --> 00:37:15,657
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would try to share them with

440
00:37:16,622 --> 00:37:22,349
[SPEAKER_01]: either other members of the media or potential funders or just anybody.

441
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:28,857
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would get things like, oh, maybe you're a hammer looking for a nail.

442
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:33,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I literally had somebody say to me, well, maybe

443
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:35,969
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe your credibility is in question.

444
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:36,929
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what?

445
00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:47,252
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like this reporter who had won a big award and it was like in a 15 minute conversation, like this came out, it was like, where did that come?

446
00:37:47,272 --> 00:37:47,812
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?

447
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:53,994
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was interesting because I think part of it's like also the misogyny, right?

448
00:37:54,014 --> 00:37:57,695
[SPEAKER_01]: And the women piece, like there's a whole bunch of things, but it's been really interesting trying to convince people.

449
00:37:57,755 --> 00:38:02,777
[SPEAKER_01]: But on a positive note, there were people that believed and one of them,

450
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:09,406
[SPEAKER_01]: was the Suffolk County District Attorney at the time, Rachel Rollins, who ended up becoming the United States Attorney.

451
00:38:09,526 --> 00:38:14,051
[SPEAKER_01]: And she reopened several of the cases that we brought to them.

452
00:38:14,151 --> 00:38:18,135
[SPEAKER_01]: She had her team reopen several of these unsolved homicides, and they continue to work on them.

453
00:38:18,595 --> 00:38:22,138
[SPEAKER_01]: And they brought families in, and it's made a big difference in these families' lives.

454
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:23,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was remarkable.

455
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,563
[SPEAKER_01]: that that happened and that she did that.

456
00:38:26,683 --> 00:38:30,648
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think part of that was also because she was a woman, and she was more sensitive to these things.

457
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:34,272
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was also a foster parent to her nieces.

458
00:38:35,373 --> 00:38:37,976
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think understood some things on a personal level as well.

459
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:43,002
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, but I also went into one of her forensic teams who is working with a local

460
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:49,837
[SPEAKER_01]: police department when I was going in to try to, and I would bring these PowerPoints with the data to prove to them, you know, and all this stuff.

461
00:38:50,658 --> 00:38:58,046
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like trying to get my PowerPoint up and it wasn't working and I was getting a little cotton mouth and I was probably triggered and all this other stuff because that's the other thing.

462
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,268
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like authority triggers me, right?

463
00:39:00,288 --> 00:39:02,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Like law enforcement triggers me, right?

464
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:02,990
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?

465
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:03,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Being in these places.

466
00:39:05,332 --> 00:39:07,413
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll never forget it.

467
00:39:07,533 --> 00:39:14,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never forget this forensic interviewer and she stopped me and she gave me a drink of water and she said, can I stop you for a minute?

468
00:39:14,856 --> 00:39:15,797
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, yeah.

469
00:39:16,257 --> 00:39:18,198
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, I believe you.

470
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:30,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's so powerful and discouraging that people don't hear it more or that there's only these very few places that they get that.

471
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:34,570
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first thing I say to people when they tell me their story, I believe you.

472
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:38,031
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say it in the podcast, I said it in episode two, I believe you.

473
00:39:38,871 --> 00:39:39,971
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's so important.

474
00:39:39,991 --> 00:39:52,634
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you hear in like the Me Too movement and the other people that were trying to tell their stories for years and would be given NDAs or paid off or anything, it's just like all of that trauma and then it doesn't go away.

475
00:39:53,114 --> 00:39:56,255
[SPEAKER_01]: But the mass media for me has been helpful in like feeling

476
00:39:57,035 --> 00:40:03,237
[SPEAKER_01]: some validation in the truth-telling and also some vindication.

477
00:40:03,497 --> 00:40:08,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it's like, the documentary went out to 35 million people.

478
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:19,923
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had people from China and Thailand and I had this lovely woman from China contact me and she made this huge, I have it on my wall back here, but she made this huge, I don't know, 10 by 12, no, bigger, big poster size,

479
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:31,241
[SPEAKER_01]: puzzle, which is a picture of Andy, but each of the individual puzzle pieces are children in China holding up Andy's picture.

480
00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:37,383
[SPEAKER_01]: And she promised me that she would be sure to teach children in China about

481
00:40:37,972 --> 00:40:40,613
[SPEAKER_01]: child safety and how to protect themselves.

482
00:40:40,653 --> 00:40:44,215
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like that kind of thing that you're like, oh my God, like this does matter.

483
00:40:44,255 --> 00:40:45,256
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a difference.

484
00:40:45,296 --> 00:40:47,797
[SPEAKER_01]: The podcast is on episode three.

485
00:40:48,117 --> 00:40:50,979
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been downloaded 25,000 times at this point.

486
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:53,620
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been trending on Apple podcasts.

487
00:40:54,601 --> 00:41:00,264
[SPEAKER_01]: We were in the top 30 the first week of Apple true crime category.

488
00:41:00,864 --> 00:41:02,665
[SPEAKER_01]: That's unheard of for an independent podcast.

489
00:41:02,685 --> 00:41:03,286
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the other thing.

490
00:41:03,306 --> 00:41:04,586
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast is independent.

491
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:07,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody would pick it up.

492
00:41:07,288 --> 00:41:07,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.

493
00:41:07,728 --> 00:41:10,129
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like nobody... And I know it's a tough subject.

494
00:41:10,209 --> 00:41:10,970
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.

495
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,712
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, oh, but there's lots of tough subjects out there and lots of people cover them.

496
00:41:15,232 --> 00:41:24,798
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like... I mean, I think that certainly eight years ago when I was pitching it, it also sort of... There was this whole Pizzagate thing, which was terrible.

497
00:41:25,398 --> 00:41:33,161
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but really it was terrible to the movement of prevention of child sexual abuse because people can just dismiss things like, oh, that's not true.

498
00:41:33,181 --> 00:41:34,361
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a conspiracy.

499
00:41:34,781 --> 00:41:40,283
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just dismiss things in our society because it's hard to hear or they don't want to talk about it.

500
00:41:41,304 --> 00:41:44,465
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of say to people, when you hear the word witch hunt,

501
00:41:45,245 --> 00:41:48,448
[SPEAKER_01]: make your ears perk up a little bit more and just sort of say, what's that about?

502
00:41:48,529 --> 00:42:08,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you'll see in the episode that's coming out this Tuesday, which is a very powerful episode called The Other Boston Sex Scandal, that there was a group of men who were trafficking boys in the city and around the city, and they formed

503
00:42:09,649 --> 00:42:18,676
[SPEAKER_01]: and became the first widely known pedophile organization in the country called NAMBLA, the North American Man Boy Love Association.

504
00:42:19,176 --> 00:42:28,723
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was right here in Revere, Massachusetts, just months after Andy disappeared and many other boys just like Andy disappeared.

505
00:42:29,604 --> 00:42:30,365
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um,

506
00:42:31,146 --> 00:42:42,537
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they were doctors and millionaires and, you know, assistant headmasters at private elite schools and, you know, all of these sort of privileged people.

507
00:42:44,118 --> 00:42:49,964
[SPEAKER_01]: But what people don't know is that even just two years before that, and I cover this in this podcast in next episode,

508
00:42:51,125 --> 00:43:00,711
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there was a supervisor of social work who had, you know, set up a fake foster home and was trafficking boys to pedophiles.

509
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:09,336
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and they created a task force to investigate because thank God, you know, this Boston homicide detective would not let it go.

510
00:43:09,516 --> 00:43:18,441
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just, you know, didn't believe what was alleged to be a suicide of one of the boys and just kept, you know, like a, you know, dog with a bone, he wouldn't get off the case.

511
00:43:18,481 --> 00:43:19,002
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally,

512
00:43:19,762 --> 00:43:31,264
[SPEAKER_01]: His investigation led to this interagency task force between the attorney general's office and Boston police and DCF, which was then called Department of Public Welfare.

513
00:43:32,345 --> 00:43:43,047
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were supposed to be investigating 5,000 placements of foster children and 3,200 foster homes to determine how many of the children had actually been placed with

514
00:43:43,967 --> 00:44:00,435
[SPEAKER_01]: what they called known homosexual single men at the time, because there was a lot of conflation of homosexuality and pedophilia at the time, because it was, you know, there was still this was the gay rights movement era, and people were still, as they are today, very much discriminated against.

515
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:03,696
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but there's a big history in Boston of the gay rights movement.

516
00:44:03,757 --> 00:44:06,638
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really amazing, like, I'm hoping to get an interview about this, because

517
00:44:07,298 --> 00:44:13,683
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these pedophiles tried to attach themselves to the legitimate gay rights movement in Massachusetts in the 1970s.

518
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:22,550
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was homosexual or it was gay women, you know, lesbian women who, who put the stop to that.

519
00:44:22,631 --> 00:44:30,617
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, no, you know, Representative Elaine Noble, who was really widely known and just a huge gay rights advocate said, no, you don't march with us.

520
00:44:30,677 --> 00:44:31,518
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not, you know,

521
00:44:32,368 --> 00:44:36,289
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not with you, we don't believe that children, that this is part of that.

522
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:39,910
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was really remarkable, but they did try to attach themselves to the gay rights movement.

523
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:43,171
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they were conflating a lot of this with gay rights.

524
00:44:43,251 --> 00:44:47,752
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way that it's recorded in the day is that they were placed with known homosexual single men.

525
00:44:47,812 --> 00:44:58,794
[SPEAKER_01]: But in fact, these men were pedophiles and foster children were being placed by a supervisor of social work in the Roxbury office, at least allegedly 100, maybe more children.

526
00:45:03,116 --> 00:45:11,827
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I did a FOIA, which is a Freedom of Information Act request on the records for this task force because I wanted to know what the outcome was like, well, what was the report like?

527
00:45:11,867 --> 00:45:12,648
[SPEAKER_01]: What did they decide?

528
00:45:12,688 --> 00:45:13,109
[SPEAKER_01]: How many?

529
00:45:13,149 --> 00:45:14,190
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what was the answer?

530
00:45:15,568 --> 00:45:17,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing, like nothing to be found.

531
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:21,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody seems to remember that there was a task force.

532
00:45:21,373 --> 00:45:23,215
[SPEAKER_01]: The AG's office says there's no files.

533
00:45:23,755 --> 00:45:25,937
[SPEAKER_01]: If I talk to people, this is living history.

534
00:45:25,977 --> 00:45:28,619
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not like, I mean, I was alive when it happened.

535
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,821
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of people still alive when it happened.

536
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:34,805
[SPEAKER_01]: And amazingly, they don't seem to remember or don't wanna talk about it.

537
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,166
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, really incredible.

538
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:41,891
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just two years later that this Revere ring was broken up, which was the creation of the organization NAMBLA.

539
00:45:43,058 --> 00:45:50,854
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were, you know, these child trafficking rings around the country and around in Massachusetts and nobody really realized this was happening.

540
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,419
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we didn't have mass media in the way we do now.

541
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:53,920
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have.

542
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,216
[SPEAKER_01]: internet.

543
00:45:55,236 --> 00:45:57,338
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't able to learn things in an instant.

544
00:45:58,039 --> 00:45:59,781
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a couple of channels and that was it.

545
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:01,363
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it was reported, it was reported.

546
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:02,384
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it wasn't, it wasn't.

547
00:46:02,464 --> 00:46:03,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't know.

548
00:46:04,046 --> 00:46:08,591
[SPEAKER_01]: And come to find out, you'll find out in the podcast as well that this was a national issue.

549
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:15,298
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, there was congressional hearings that were held to create the first ever laws preventing

550
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:18,142
[SPEAKER_01]: child pornography because it wasn't even illegal.

551
00:46:19,524 --> 00:46:20,165
[SPEAKER_01]: This is crazy.

552
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:24,450
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's sort of like the big picture and it comes from a very personal place.

553
00:46:24,951 --> 00:46:27,495
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we go back to the very personal place, which is

554
00:46:29,234 --> 00:46:30,635
[SPEAKER_01]: advocacy and a call to action.

555
00:46:31,056 --> 00:46:36,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I really want this podcast, what I hope this podcast will achieve are a few things.

556
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:44,767
[SPEAKER_01]: One is I want a task force investigation in Massachusetts of these unsolved cases of missing and murdered children from the 1970s.

557
00:46:45,027 --> 00:46:46,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see that happen.

558
00:46:47,128 --> 00:46:51,410
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see a missing persons database created, which does not exist right now.

559
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,631
[SPEAKER_01]: I do do legislative advocacy.

560
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:59,954
[SPEAKER_01]: We've worked with Senator Joan Lovely, who's done a lot of work on ending the statute of limitations, which we're very much for that.

561
00:47:00,014 --> 00:47:01,755
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another call to action.

562
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:14,360
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also suspect, I don't suspect, I know that there are dozens, if not hundreds of other children from Lawrence, Massachusetts, from that time,

563
00:47:15,354 --> 00:47:38,279
[SPEAKER_01]: that were part of this organized and coordinated abuse, and that have not come forward, that either they haven't come forward because their community won't represent them or believe them, or because they're men who are expected to be strong, or women who are expected to not talk, or, you know,

564
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:46,566
[SPEAKER_01]: suffering from addiction and unable to, or have died because of the trauma.

565
00:47:46,606 --> 00:47:50,309
[SPEAKER_01]: But I suspect there's so many more victims in Lawrence and survivors in Lawrence.

566
00:47:50,369 --> 00:48:04,142
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that they'll hear this podcast and that they'll know that there's a community, that there's an army of survivors that are trying to change outcomes for future generations and that we believe them and we want to help.

567
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:06,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.

568
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:15,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it sounds like this, the process of making the documentary and the podcast have had some helpful sort of healing elements for you.

569
00:48:15,273 --> 00:48:20,276
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like to some goals around how this can impact locally.

570
00:48:20,296 --> 00:48:26,359
[SPEAKER_02]: So like how, you know, how we can acknowledge this as like a real thing and a problem and something that we want to maybe

571
00:48:27,499 --> 00:48:28,760
[SPEAKER_02]: give some more attention to.

572
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:43,346
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one thing- Yeah, well, one of the things sort of, yeah, thank you for bringing it to the local piece too, because one of the things is, yes, I did, this has made me have to really look at not just communal trauma and community trauma, but personal trauma.

573
00:48:43,426 --> 00:48:49,068
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I very highly recommend trauma therapy.

574
00:48:49,108 --> 00:48:50,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really important.

575
00:48:50,489 --> 00:48:55,731
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think people should explore this issue without qualified support.

576
00:48:55,771 --> 00:48:57,032
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a difficult issue.

577
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:01,311
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this podcast can be triggering for some people and I understand that.

578
00:49:01,831 --> 00:49:07,412
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think it's really important, like somebody was like, oh, I don't know if I can listen to that because it's hard to listen to.

579
00:49:07,452 --> 00:49:09,652
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, yeah, no, I'm sure.

580
00:49:09,712 --> 00:49:13,733
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, imagine how hard it is for the children not to be heard or not to be listened to.

581
00:49:14,053 --> 00:49:22,395
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, I think it's the least we can do is listen to these stories and try to do something for these kids, survivors and kids that it's still happening to today.

582
00:49:22,615 --> 00:49:23,255
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to get

583
00:49:24,738 --> 00:49:33,362
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States attorney to meet with, you know, some survivors and Mitch Garabedian who played, you know, was played by Stanley Tucci in the Spotlight movie.

584
00:49:33,382 --> 00:49:39,305
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember one of the people at the table said to Mitch Garabedian, well, you know, this is from a long time ago.

585
00:49:39,365 --> 00:49:40,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Is any of this happening today?

586
00:49:40,525 --> 00:49:41,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Mitch was like, are you kidding?

587
00:49:42,206 --> 00:49:48,369
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and also, like, we don't even know because most people don't talk about their child sexual abuse till they're 40 or 50 years old.

588
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,630
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk to them in 30 years, you know.

589
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:54,492
[SPEAKER_01]: But locally, getting to the local piece, you know, Carmen Durso, who is another

590
00:49:55,313 --> 00:49:58,156
[SPEAKER_01]: attorney who's a huge activist in this work.

591
00:49:58,817 --> 00:50:10,869
[SPEAKER_01]: And full disclosure, I'm on a board with Carmen Durso called, it's, you know, was formerly named Masked Kids, it's now the organization, nonprofit organization, it's now the Children's Justice Campaign and Enough Abuse Campaign.

592
00:50:12,516 --> 00:50:31,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Carmen does a lot of work there really targeting abuse in schools, because you know what happens a lot of times in schools, when abuse occurs, is that the perpetrator is quietly let go not unlike the Catholic Church, so they'll be offered, you know, the opportunity to leave the position, as opposed to being fired.

593
00:50:32,934 --> 00:50:35,355
[SPEAKER_01]: and charges being filed or whatever.

594
00:50:35,455 --> 00:50:42,438
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what happens is they can go to the school right down the street or in another district and, you know, get hired again and who knows what happens after that, right?

595
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:43,618
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of the same thing.

596
00:50:43,658 --> 00:50:48,600
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it past the trash in the, you know, CSA prevention community.

597
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,441
[SPEAKER_01]: But Carmen's working a lot on that.

598
00:50:50,841 --> 00:50:54,342
[SPEAKER_01]: And so is the Masks, Kids and Enough Abuse.

599
00:50:54,382 --> 00:51:00,225
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after getting on their board, the executive director Jetta Bernier shared with me

600
00:51:01,085 --> 00:51:07,950
[SPEAKER_01]: a curriculum that they had around training for staff members to identify grooming behavior and other behavior.

601
00:51:08,631 --> 00:51:19,518
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were able, thank goodness, you know, Superintendent Maurice-Edouard Vincent took the curriculum and it is a mandatory training now in our district.

602
00:51:19,818 --> 00:51:27,023
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a result of a Cummings grant that was, you know, that MassKids had long before I was on the board.

603
00:51:27,064 --> 00:51:29,145
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they've been doing this work in other districts and

604
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:35,523
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just something that we were able to bring to Medford just by connecting the superintendent and MassKids.

605
00:51:35,563 --> 00:51:39,985
[SPEAKER_01]: And to her credit and her administration's credit, they brought it forward.

606
00:51:40,025 --> 00:51:46,629
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we've heard from the evaluations, it's said it's been remarkably helpful and it's made a huge difference.

607
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:52,952
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's another step in that curriculum and MassKids is hoping to work with the Medford public schools to enhance that.

608
00:51:53,632 --> 00:51:55,954
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying to set up another meeting with them as well.

609
00:51:55,994 --> 00:51:57,616
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really, really important work.

610
00:51:57,676 --> 00:52:00,518
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the responsibility of the community to do this work.

611
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:10,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, and I think one of the things I think about a lot with this type of abuse is the element of power, right?

612
00:52:10,106 --> 00:52:11,488
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the, I think that

613
00:52:13,148 --> 00:52:21,193
[SPEAKER_02]: In any type of sexual crime, there's usually, even when it's an adult victim, there's much more concern for protecting the perpetrator.

614
00:52:21,273 --> 00:52:25,916
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're not convicted of something, it doesn't tend to follow them.

615
00:52:25,996 --> 00:52:29,258
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know it's really hard to convict people of this.

616
00:52:29,278 --> 00:52:32,400
[SPEAKER_02]: But also with children, when children are the victim,

617
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:46,948
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it seems like it would make logical sense that we would like want to think about protecting children, but that most like most often we're thinking about the rights and the needs of the adult and like, like you're saying about like that past the trash like it's.

618
00:52:47,933 --> 00:52:50,795
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like really true and it's just awful.

619
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:55,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the way that we talk, like, you know, we can't reveal what this person did or we can't talk about it.

620
00:52:55,959 --> 00:52:56,820
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like- Right?

621
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,181
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, it's crazy.

622
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:00,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and the long-term ramifications, that's the thing.

623
00:53:00,883 --> 00:53:03,645
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like people, you know, this is not a one-off instance.

624
00:53:03,685 --> 00:53:10,430
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the effect that this has on children's lives is something that impacts them for the entirety of their life.

625
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:12,691
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that's the other piece of it.

626
00:53:12,811 --> 00:53:15,714
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's generational and it's, you know, so many other things,

627
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:20,798
[SPEAKER_01]: also around sort of protecting the children and giving names to things.

628
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:32,708
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other thing is that, you know, one of the things I said, the best part of going to Harvard, and honestly, this is true, the most important thing I learned at Harvard was that there is a word for everything.

629
00:53:34,149 --> 00:53:40,054
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you understand what the word is, then you can start to potentially attack the problem, right?

630
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:44,718
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why I do get into this podcast about the fact that like known,

631
00:53:45,605 --> 00:53:48,786
[SPEAKER_01]: single homosexual men does not equate pedophile, right?

632
00:53:48,906 --> 00:53:50,887
[SPEAKER_01]: But pedophile is this, right?

633
00:53:51,087 --> 00:53:53,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, there was no word for human trafficking at the time.

634
00:53:53,828 --> 00:53:54,628
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what they called it?

635
00:53:54,768 --> 00:53:55,428
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you do.

636
00:53:55,629 --> 00:53:56,709
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what they called it at the time?

637
00:53:56,729 --> 00:53:57,329
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't.

638
00:53:57,929 --> 00:53:59,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Child prostitution.

639
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, great.

640
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:01,010
Yeah.

641
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:02,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Child prostitution.

642
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are you kidding me?

643
00:54:04,512 --> 00:54:08,053
[SPEAKER_01]: And this coming episode, we have a survivor who was, you know,

644
00:54:08,633 --> 00:54:12,755
[SPEAKER_01]: self-identifies as a quote-unquote child prostitute, but children can't prostitute themselves.

645
00:54:13,275 --> 00:54:15,475
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have the ability to consent.

646
00:54:16,576 --> 00:54:17,816
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that.

647
00:54:18,997 --> 00:54:22,518
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other piece is, getting back to the words, there's a word for everything.

648
00:54:22,698 --> 00:54:31,981
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that what Andy and I didn't have back in the day is something called social capital.

649
00:54:34,462 --> 00:54:36,983
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew

650
00:54:38,977 --> 00:54:41,698
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to know that whatever that was, my kids were going to have it.

651
00:54:42,299 --> 00:54:43,519
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to be there for them.

652
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:44,860
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to advocate for them.

653
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,781
[SPEAKER_01]: And people were going to know that these are not the kids you mess with.

654
00:54:47,961 --> 00:54:48,982
[SPEAKER_01]: These are whatever.

655
00:54:49,042 --> 00:54:51,523
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to do whatever it took, run for school committee, do whatever.

656
00:54:52,403 --> 00:54:58,586
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other piece of it is not just doing it for my kid, doing it for the system as a whole and for the other kids.

657
00:54:59,947 --> 00:55:05,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was that kid that the teacher might not have paid as much attention to because

658
00:55:06,646 --> 00:55:09,128
[SPEAKER_01]: My mother wasn't gonna show up for the PTO meetings.

659
00:55:09,188 --> 00:55:14,112
[SPEAKER_01]: My mother wasn't gonna ask if, why I got detention or any of those things.

660
00:55:14,172 --> 00:55:21,358
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would have been, a lot of the abuse frankly that I experienced as a kid was ignored by systems.

661
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:33,948
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of it is, I don't wanna get involved and a whole bunch of things and people have their reasons, but the first, in my own experience, the first 51A, which is a complaint of child abuse,

662
00:55:34,668 --> 00:55:39,170
[SPEAKER_01]: was filed for me, I guess I could say, in kindergarten.

663
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:43,611
[SPEAKER_01]: And I left of my own volition when I was 14.

664
00:55:46,132 --> 00:55:57,496
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you think about how that's complicated, that child abuse and stuff is complicated also through language barriers, through poverty, through all of these things.

665
00:55:57,536 --> 00:56:02,098
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have so many kids here in Medford, this beautiful city,

666
00:56:03,418 --> 00:56:10,692
[SPEAKER_01]: whose real estate values are going off the chart, and we still have those kids that

667
00:56:12,316 --> 00:56:15,639
[SPEAKER_01]: like me and Lawrence that were literally malnourished.

668
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:19,802
[SPEAKER_01]: And people couldn't tell by looking at me that that was what was going on.

669
00:56:19,923 --> 00:56:22,004
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't see who those kids are.

670
00:56:22,044 --> 00:56:26,808
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know by looking at them that these are the kids that aren't getting food or that getting abused or whatever.

671
00:56:26,848 --> 00:56:35,075
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll just say this, one in four children, one in four girls will experience CSA.

672
00:56:36,156 --> 00:56:39,817
[SPEAKER_01]: And it said between one in eight and one in 10 boys is the statistic.

673
00:56:40,337 --> 00:56:44,779
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the boys actually is probably higher, but boys, again, don't often report.

674
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:47,520
[SPEAKER_01]: But those statistics are really high.

675
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:58,983
[SPEAKER_01]: So if one in four girls has experienced CSA and one in eight or one in 10 boys, how many pedophiles does that make?

676
00:56:59,583 --> 00:56:59,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

677
00:57:00,664 --> 00:57:02,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

678
00:57:02,964 --> 00:57:03,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Chilling, yeah.

679
00:57:04,605 --> 00:57:04,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

680
00:57:05,517 --> 00:57:06,398
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's intense.

681
00:57:06,818 --> 00:57:09,360
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's end on a happy note.

682
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,241
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we transfer this into a happy note?

683
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:11,582
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

684
00:57:11,602 --> 00:57:11,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

685
00:57:12,222 --> 00:57:16,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the way we transfer this into a happy note is that, you know, there are a lot of advocates in this city.

686
00:57:16,885 --> 00:57:19,147
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of people that want to do the right thing by kids.

687
00:57:19,187 --> 00:57:20,808
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of good people in this city.

688
00:57:20,948 --> 00:57:27,934
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would encourage them to, you know, look beyond, you know, the families that are always showing up to the meetings and, you know,

689
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:33,602
[SPEAKER_01]: and really think about how we're reaching these kids that aren't being reached.

690
00:57:33,622 --> 00:57:35,462
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a huge Haitian Creole community.

691
00:57:35,482 --> 00:57:37,323
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a huge Portuguese speaking community.

692
00:57:37,383 --> 00:57:43,945
[SPEAKER_01]: We have multiple public housing units in the city.

693
00:57:44,165 --> 00:57:48,206
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's incredible.

694
00:57:48,246 --> 00:57:49,907
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so ironic, Danielle.

695
00:57:49,927 --> 00:57:53,248
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when my kids were in school and I would be like, they would be friends with kids

696
00:57:54,225 --> 00:57:56,326
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that might be in the housing authority, whatever.

697
00:57:56,366 --> 00:57:58,426
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would be like, invite them over, have them come over, whatever.

698
00:57:58,446 --> 00:58:00,927
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would be like, no, I'm not inviting them over, mom.

699
00:58:00,947 --> 00:58:02,188
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, what are you talking about?

700
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:04,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd be like, I'm embarrassed to invite them over our house.

701
00:58:04,928 --> 00:58:05,769
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, what?

702
00:58:05,789 --> 00:58:08,149
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the weirdest experience, Danielle.

703
00:58:08,169 --> 00:58:15,772
[SPEAKER_01]: They were embarrassed to invite them over to our house because we had a nice house, because they might think we were rich.

704
00:58:17,374 --> 00:58:18,934
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, the irony, right?

705
00:58:19,014 --> 00:58:20,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the effing irony in my life.

706
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:21,856
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what?

707
00:58:22,056 --> 00:58:24,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it was just crazy, but it's true.

708
00:58:24,457 --> 00:58:34,523
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you can just get comfortable in your own environment and forget that this is happening and that these are, you know, this is real and these kids are experiencing this and we're obligated to help.

709
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:39,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I do think good news is that this podcast is coming out.

710
00:58:39,304 --> 00:58:44,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I met with you several years ago and you were really trying to get it out there and it's finally out there.

711
00:58:44,809 --> 00:58:51,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And you mentioned Harvard a few times and I will say this about Harvard is that they do a great job of, or I mean, I don't know, great job, but they

712
00:58:52,796 --> 00:58:56,099
[SPEAKER_02]: have a system in which students report sexual trauma, right?

713
00:58:56,159 --> 00:59:04,127
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I think a lot of schools have shied away from that because if we acknowledge a problem is a problem, then we have to acknowledge that it's a problem, right?

714
00:59:04,227 --> 00:59:13,956
[SPEAKER_02]: And what Harvard does and what I think you're doing in this podcast is like putting a name to things and getting them out there so we can acknowledge them and then we can, you know, help to

715
00:59:14,937 --> 00:59:15,918
[SPEAKER_02]: help to work on it, right?

716
00:59:16,098 --> 00:59:18,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

717
00:59:18,259 --> 00:59:19,400
[SPEAKER_01]: When you ignore it, it's just whatever.

718
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:23,263
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will also say Harvard has done that because they've been sued multiple times.

719
00:59:23,683 --> 00:59:26,425
[SPEAKER_01]: So lawsuits make change, right?

720
00:59:26,465 --> 00:59:27,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Lawsuits create systemic change.

721
00:59:27,986 --> 00:59:28,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?

722
00:59:28,466 --> 00:59:30,048
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, well, how do you create change?

723
00:59:30,088 --> 00:59:34,070
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, unfortunately, a lot of times it's lawsuits, it's the law, you know, and it's changing that.

724
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:35,531
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of different ways to do it.

725
00:59:35,571 --> 00:59:38,994
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually, and it's the same thing with these cases from the 1970s.

726
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:39,534
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?

727
00:59:39,594 --> 00:59:40,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Why were all of these

728
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:46,575
[SPEAKER_01]: child pornography and pedophile rings, frankly, being broken up around the country in 1978.

729
00:59:48,236 --> 00:59:53,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that happened because there were a spate of missing children around the country.

730
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:58,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they had congressional hearings and they created laws.

731
00:59:58,684 --> 01:00:01,065
[SPEAKER_01]: The first Child Sex Exploitation Act was created in 1978.

732
01:00:02,567 --> 01:00:05,589
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children

733
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:08,284
[SPEAKER_01]: was created in 1984.

734
01:00:08,904 --> 01:00:16,489
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the National Center's own history, they'll say they were created because of a spate of missing children's cases.

735
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:21,313
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll say they were created because of a spate of missing children's cases across the country.

736
01:00:25,961 --> 01:00:35,893
[SPEAKER_01]: I had one of Andy's caseworkers tell me that the highest decade for children going missing still to this day is the 1970s in America, in modern history.

737
01:00:36,553 --> 01:00:43,181
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody has gone back retrospectively to be like, all right, maybe we should look at this and see what is this data?

738
01:00:43,221 --> 01:00:46,105
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I would love to see an institution really do a

739
01:00:46,863 --> 01:00:57,068
[SPEAKER_01]: a case analysis, institutional study about what was really this, how did this industry, this billion already, billion dollar industry affect these outcomes.

740
01:00:57,808 --> 01:00:59,949
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's another conversation for another day.

741
01:01:00,009 --> 01:01:03,711
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't start another podcast at the end of this one, but I hope people will listen.

742
01:01:04,571 --> 01:01:08,913
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find us, our website is openinvestigationpodcast.com.

743
01:01:09,394 --> 01:01:11,135
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find us anywhere you listen.

744
01:01:11,975 --> 01:01:14,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, we've gotten almost 200 five-star reviews

745
01:01:17,069 --> 01:01:19,753
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you read the comments and the reviews, you'll hear why.

746
01:01:19,773 --> 01:01:28,367
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a very fact-based, data-driven podcast, but it also has heart and empathy and passion.

747
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:31,072
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's what helps.

748
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:32,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very well made.

749
01:01:32,682 --> 01:01:35,544
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, heavy content and very pleasing to listen to.

750
01:01:37,205 --> 01:01:37,465
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

751
01:01:37,505 --> 01:01:41,448
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny that you say that, because somebody else said that they were like, the music's really great.

752
01:01:41,548 --> 01:01:49,855
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody, I think, wrote on one of the Apple podcast reviews or something like that, like I could listen to this host, you know, forever, her voice or whatever, forever.

753
01:01:49,895 --> 01:01:53,257
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, it's kind of a weird thing to say when you're talking about, you know what I mean?

754
01:01:53,277 --> 01:01:54,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, but it's true.

755
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:55,719
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess that maybe offsets it.

756
01:01:55,759 --> 01:02:00,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe you need a soothing voice to be able to tell you these horrible stories, you know.

757
01:02:01,183 --> 01:02:05,786
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there are any survivors out there, Danielle, listening, I just want to say, you know, you're not alone.

758
01:02:07,047 --> 01:02:07,707
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe you.

759
01:02:09,228 --> 01:02:12,490
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's the National Sexual Abuse Hotline, which is RAINN.

760
01:02:13,411 --> 01:02:16,873
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have the number in front of me, but I think it's 1-800-656-HOPE.

761
01:02:16,893 --> 01:02:20,655
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe you can include that as part of your ending here.

762
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:23,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

763
01:02:23,552 --> 01:02:28,616
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, you know, the body does keep the score and, you know, trauma does stay with us.

764
01:02:28,736 --> 01:02:34,980
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I love, I think it's a quote from, I don't remember who, but you can help me out with this too.

765
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,543
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love that, you know, the world is full of suffering, but it's also full of the overcoming of it.

766
01:02:39,563 --> 01:02:42,385
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great place to end.

767
01:02:42,985 --> 01:02:43,906
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you, Melanie.

768
01:02:43,946 --> 01:02:46,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to hearing the rest of the podcast.

769
01:02:46,287 --> 01:02:46,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

770
01:02:46,808 --> 01:02:47,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you think.

771
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:49,389

772
01:02:49,409 --> 01:02:49,850
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps.

773
01:02:57,168 --> 01:02:59,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for listening to today's episode.
