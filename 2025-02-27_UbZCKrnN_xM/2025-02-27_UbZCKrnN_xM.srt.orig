00:00:00,564 --> 00:00:03,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello Sunny Fam and welcome to your 10 minute vibration plate workout.

2
00:00:04,026 --> 00:00:08,629
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for a workout that's consisting of warming up and mobility, this is the place for you.

3
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:13,732
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get started.

4
00:00:14,612 --> 00:00:18,355
[SPEAKER_01]: First exercise we're going to do is neck mobility.

5
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:21,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and start your vibration plate.

6
00:00:22,197 --> 00:00:23,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever setting you feel most comfortable.

7
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:27,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and step on.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,082
[SPEAKER_01]: So, first, drop your right arm, your right ear, excuse me, to your right shoulder.

9
00:00:36,863 --> 00:00:37,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to neutral.

10
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:40,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Left ear, left shoulder.

11
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:43,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Neutral.

12
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:45,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Again to the right.

13
00:00:48,087 --> 00:00:49,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy the stretch.

14
00:00:49,948 --> 00:00:50,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Neutral.

15
00:00:52,673 --> 00:00:54,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Left ear, left shoulder.

16
00:00:55,397 --> 00:00:56,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and pause the beat.

17
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:57,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to neutral.

18
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:02,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what we're gonna do is go ahead and drop that right ear to the right shoulder.

19
00:01:03,268 --> 00:01:06,812
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you're gonna pivot your chin down to the shoulder and look down with your eyes.

20
00:01:08,404 --> 00:01:10,925
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be feeling a nice pull just behind the ear.

21
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:12,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold it a few beats.

22
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:15,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Head up, back to central.

23
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:18,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and drop that left ear, left shoulder.

24
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:22,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, now you're gonna turn your chin to the left shoulder.

25
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:28,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, you'll get a nice pull right behind the ear and down the neck.

26
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:31,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back to neutral.

27
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:34,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we'll do some rotations.

28
00:01:35,475 --> 00:01:37,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and look over your right shoulder.

29
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Pause.

30
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:41,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Neutral.

31
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:42,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Left.

32
00:01:44,343 --> 00:01:44,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Neutral.

33
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

34
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:48,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Neutral.

35
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:50,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Left.

36
00:01:51,747 --> 00:01:52,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Neutral.

37
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:53,488
[SPEAKER_01]: One more time on each side.

38
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:57,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And left.

39
00:01:59,097 --> 00:02:01,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're gonna do a bit of lymphatic drainage.

40
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:11,486
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna start with the right hand going over the left, just underneath your left chin and make the figure eight under the chin and down the neck.

41
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:16,909
[SPEAKER_01]: This helps get rid of swelling, waste and toxic.

42
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and keep pulling.

43
00:02:20,232 --> 00:02:22,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't have to be nice and firm, doesn't have to be hard.

44
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:27,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Right across the chin, down the neck.

45
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:31,889
[SPEAKER_01]: against the chin and down the neck.

46
00:02:34,149 --> 00:02:36,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and start on the right side.

47
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, under the chin and pull on down the neck.

48
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:45,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Chin and pull down the neck.

49
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:50,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Again with the chin and pull down the neck.

50
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:52,913
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no rush, enjoy.

51
00:02:57,005 --> 00:02:58,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go and back to the left side.

52
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:00,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do five on this side.

53
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:02,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice and smooth.

54
00:03:03,026 --> 00:03:04,106
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll go back to the right.

55
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:13,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Last one here.

56
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:20,049
[SPEAKER_01]: You even have lift nodes right under your clavicle.

57
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:24,410
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you would like some massaging just above the clavicle.

58
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:27,443
[SPEAKER_01]: A few strokes, you can do that as well.

59
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we'll start with some torso rotations.

60
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,914
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have your arms completely out if you like, or fist to fist where your elbows are out.

61
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:43,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and rotate to the right.

62
00:03:45,557 --> 00:03:45,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Neutral.

63
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:47,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Left.

64
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Neutral.

65
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:50,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Right again.

66
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:53,123
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pause for a beat there.

67
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:54,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to neutral.

68
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:59,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Left, back to neutral.

69
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:04,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Right again, back to neutral.

70
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:06,453
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so good for circulation.

71
00:04:06,473 --> 00:04:14,561
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be used again as a warm up, a cool down, first thing in the morning.

72
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:19,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Left, back to neutral.

73
00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:21,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

74
00:04:22,993 --> 00:04:24,213
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna pick up the pace a bit.

75
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,534
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we pick up the pace, we're gonna double up on each side.

76
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,854
[SPEAKER_01]: So starting with the right.

77
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:32,135
[SPEAKER_01]: One and two.

78
00:04:32,596 --> 00:04:33,096
[SPEAKER_01]: To neutral.

79
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:36,377
[SPEAKER_01]: One and two.

80
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:42,139
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any lower back issues, be mindful that you don't overdo it.

81
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:49,401
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also helps getting the range of motion in your thoracic spine, especially if you do a lot of seating all day.

82
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to neutral, double up.

83
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Neutral.

84
00:04:59,062 --> 00:05:01,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and do it with your arms fully extended.

85
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:04,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Gives you a totally different sensation.

86
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,691
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to pick up the pace, you most certainly can.

87
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:17,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, neutral, left, neutral.

88
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:19,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, neutral, left, neutral.

89
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:29,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Our next exercises will be calf raises.

90
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:37,456
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're new to the vibration plate, you can have a chair placed on the side of you where it can help with your balance.

91
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:39,037
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even be close to a wall.

92
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:42,399
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna go up on your toes.

93
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,362
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not holding for long because once again, you're on a vibration plate.

94
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:48,124
[SPEAKER_01]: So up and down smooth.

95
00:05:49,085 --> 00:05:50,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Up, down smooth.

96
00:05:52,407 --> 00:05:53,928
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put your hands on your hips if you like.

97
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,251
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need more assistance with balance,

98
00:05:57,928 --> 00:06:05,931
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do your hands out, one hand out, one hand, the other hand on your hips, whichever is most comfortable for you.

99
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:11,753
[SPEAKER_01]: You will get a burn on this.

100
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:20,416
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason being is because with that pause, your calves and the arch of your Achilles have to work a little bit harder.

101
00:06:22,577 --> 00:06:26,418
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is a little too extreme for you and you're getting a burn, you can go ahead and alternate.

102
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:30,760
[SPEAKER_01]: just simply rotating each foot heel to toe.

103
00:06:33,182 --> 00:06:40,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, make sure you're breathing, keeping your core tight, shoulders back, chest up, proper posture.

104
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:42,210
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't wanna be hunching over.

105
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,472
[SPEAKER_01]: For one, it's hard to breathe that way.

106
00:06:45,312 --> 00:06:47,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, it doesn't look good on anyone.

107
00:06:50,797 --> 00:06:53,239
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanna finish out, you can go back up to regular calf raises.

108
00:06:55,486 --> 00:06:56,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Check in with yourself.

109
00:06:57,448 --> 00:07:03,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, the hardest part is showing up, so I'm proud of you for just even gauging, making the attempt.

110
00:07:03,613 --> 00:07:04,674
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get better over time.

111
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:07,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Rome was not built in a day.

112
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:11,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Going back to alternating if you like.

113
00:07:13,882 --> 00:07:15,263
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 10 more seconds here.

114
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:19,827
[SPEAKER_01]: The next exercise will be good mornings.

115
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:23,090
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be placing your hands behind your head.

116
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:28,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and make sure you still have a shoulder-width stance.

117
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Placing your feet, make sure you're dead center.

118
00:07:32,273 --> 00:07:34,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Hands behind your head, draw in your core.

119
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:36,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you're breathing and held your nose.

120
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:39,338
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're just gonna hinge at the hips.

121
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning that your hips are gonna extend outward behind you, and up nice and slow.

122
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:51,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Find whatever cadence is most comfortable for you.

123
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:53,569
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, pause.

124
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:55,250
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, up.

125
00:07:56,604 --> 00:07:58,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your core tight, one, two, three, pause.

126
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:00,788
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, up.

127
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,550
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll feel this in your hamstrings.

128
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:08,334
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna probably feel this in your calves a bit too, because we just finished doing calf raises.

129
00:08:12,398 --> 00:08:22,327
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a good mobility, full body warmup, lymphatic drainage, in addition to helping with your circulation.

130
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice and smooth.

131
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:30,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Down nice and slow.

132
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:31,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Pause.

133
00:08:33,783 --> 00:08:34,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Up nice and smooth.

134
00:08:35,804 --> 00:08:39,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go down by four, pause for four, and up for four.

135
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,587
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, four, pause.

136
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:45,929
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, four, up.

137
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:49,510
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, four, back down.

138
00:08:58,564 --> 00:09:00,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Please make sure you're not holding your breath.

139
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:06,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you're breathing.

140
00:09:07,427 --> 00:09:09,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Periodically, you can take that deep, cleansing breath.

141
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:11,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Inhale through the nose.

142
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Blow out through the mouth.

143
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:23,172
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not certain that you're breathing, because sometimes we do shallow breathing, you can actually make a sound with your breath.

144
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,721
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, now it's time to cool down.

145
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:32,222
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are almost there.

146
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:33,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Arms down.

147
00:09:34,303 --> 00:09:37,105
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just gonna do hip sways, and that's literally what you're gonna do.

148
00:09:37,846 --> 00:09:39,066
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just rocking back and forth.

149
00:09:42,288 --> 00:09:44,349
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want, you can do rocks and circles.

150
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:47,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Hands on your hips.

151
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:53,134
[SPEAKER_01]: This is primarily, like I said, for a warmup.

152
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:55,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, just to get you used to the equipment.

153
00:10:01,563 --> 00:10:02,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and alternate.

154
00:10:02,704 --> 00:10:08,629
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go the opposite way, or you can just stick with the sways.

155
00:10:14,374 --> 00:10:16,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Want to spice things up a bit, go ahead and add your arms.

156
00:10:22,181 --> 00:10:23,322

160
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:52,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, if calf raises is too difficult, use a chair, a wall, countertop, or alternate.

00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:55,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Just toe to heel, alternate feet.
