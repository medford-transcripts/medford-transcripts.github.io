00:00:00,564 --> 00:00:03,546
Hello Sunny Fam and welcome to your 10 minute vibration plate workout.

2
00:00:04,026 --> 00:00:08,629
If you're looking for a workout that's consisting of warming up and mobility, this is the place for you.

3
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:13,732
So let's get started.

4
00:00:14,612 --> 00:00:18,355
First exercise we're going to do is neck mobility.

5
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:21,016
Go ahead and start your vibration plate.

6
00:00:22,197 --> 00:00:23,878
Whatever setting you feel most comfortable.

7
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:27,279
Go ahead and step on.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,082
So, first, drop your right arm, your right ear, excuse me, to your right shoulder.

9
00:00:36,863 --> 00:00:37,543
Back to neutral.

10
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:40,204
Left ear, left shoulder.

11
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:43,525
Neutral.

12
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:45,026
Again to the right.

13
00:00:48,087 --> 00:00:49,027
Enjoy the stretch.

14
00:00:49,948 --> 00:00:50,328
Neutral.

15
00:00:52,673 --> 00:00:54,255
Left ear, left shoulder.

16
00:00:55,397 --> 00:00:56,498
Go ahead and pause the beat.

17
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:57,980
Back to neutral.

18
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:02,767
Now what we're gonna do is go ahead and drop that right ear to the right shoulder.

19
00:01:03,268 --> 00:01:06,812
But then you're gonna pivot your chin down to the shoulder and look down with your eyes.

20
00:01:08,404 --> 00:01:10,925
You'll be feeling a nice pull just behind the ear.

21
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:12,526
Hold it a few beats.

22
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:15,127
Head up, back to central.

23
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:18,588
Go ahead and drop that left ear, left shoulder.

24
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:22,750
Once again, now you're gonna turn your chin to the left shoulder.

25
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:28,632
Once again, you'll get a nice pull right behind the ear and down the neck.

26
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:31,714
Come back to neutral.

27
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:34,675
Now we'll do some rotations.

28
00:01:35,475 --> 00:01:37,436
Go ahead and look over your right shoulder.

29
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,320
Pause.

30
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:41,021
Neutral.

31
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:42,742
Left.

32
00:01:44,343 --> 00:01:44,743
Neutral.

33
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,344
Right.

34
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:48,485
Neutral.

35
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:50,546
Left.

36
00:01:51,747 --> 00:01:52,187
Neutral.

37
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:53,488
One more time on each side.

38
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:57,330
And left.

39
00:01:59,097 --> 00:02:01,539
Now we're gonna do a bit of lymphatic drainage.

40
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:11,486
We're gonna start with the right hand going over the left, just underneath your left chin and make the figure eight under the chin and down the neck.

41
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:16,909
This helps get rid of swelling, waste and toxic.

42
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,411
Go ahead and keep pulling.

43
00:02:20,232 --> 00:02:22,693
Doesn't have to be nice and firm, doesn't have to be hard.

44
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:27,757
Right across the chin, down the neck.

45
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:31,889
against the chin and down the neck.

46
00:02:34,149 --> 00:02:36,209
Go ahead and start on the right side.

47
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,050
Again, under the chin and pull on down the neck.

48
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:45,511
Chin and pull down the neck.

49
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:50,452
Again with the chin and pull down the neck.

50
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:52,913
There's no rush, enjoy.

51
00:02:57,005 --> 00:02:58,625
Let's go and back to the left side.

52
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:00,626
Let's do five on this side.

53
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:02,366
Nice and smooth.

54
00:03:03,026 --> 00:03:04,106
And then we'll go back to the right.

55
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:13,708
Last one here.

56
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:20,049
You even have lift nodes right under your clavicle.

57
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:24,410
So if you would like some massaging just above the clavicle.

58
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:27,443
A few strokes, you can do that as well.

59
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,109
Now we'll start with some torso rotations.

60
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,914
You can have your arms completely out if you like, or fist to fist where your elbows are out.

61
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:43,676
Go ahead and rotate to the right.

62
00:03:45,557 --> 00:03:45,957
Neutral.

63
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:47,338
Left.

64
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,380
Neutral.

65
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:50,481
Right again.

66
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:53,123
You can pause for a beat there.

67
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:54,504
Back to neutral.

68
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:59,345
Left, back to neutral.

69
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:04,130
Right again, back to neutral.

70
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:06,453
This is so good for circulation.

71
00:04:06,473 --> 00:04:14,561
It can be used again as a warm up, a cool down, first thing in the morning.

72
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:19,186
Left, back to neutral.

73
00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:21,352
Right.

74
00:04:22,993 --> 00:04:24,213
We're gonna pick up the pace a bit.

75
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,534
And when we pick up the pace, we're gonna double up on each side.

76
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,854
So starting with the right.

77
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:32,135
One and two.

78
00:04:32,596 --> 00:04:33,096
To neutral.

79
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:36,377
One and two.

80
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:42,139
If you have any lower back issues, be mindful that you don't overdo it.

81
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:49,401
But it also helps getting the range of motion in your thoracic spine, especially if you do a lot of seating all day.

82
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,018
Back to neutral, double up.

83
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,540
Neutral.

84
00:04:59,062 --> 00:05:01,704
Go ahead and do it with your arms fully extended.

85
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:04,205
Gives you a totally different sensation.

86
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,691
If you want to pick up the pace, you most certainly can.

87
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:17,033
Right, neutral, left, neutral.

88
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:19,735
Right, neutral, left, neutral.

89
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:29,670
Our next exercises will be calf raises.

90
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:37,456
If you're new to the vibration plate, you can have a chair placed on the side of you where it can help with your balance.

91
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:39,037
You can even be close to a wall.

92
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:42,399
You're gonna go up on your toes.

93
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,362
You're not holding for long because once again, you're on a vibration plate.

94
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:48,124
So up and down smooth.

95
00:05:49,085 --> 00:05:50,546
Up, down smooth.

96
00:05:52,407 --> 00:05:53,928
You can put your hands on your hips if you like.

97
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,251
If you need more assistance with balance,

98
00:05:57,928 --> 00:06:05,931
You can do your hands out, one hand out, one hand, the other hand on your hips, whichever is most comfortable for you.

99
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:11,753
You will get a burn on this.

100
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:20,416
The reason being is because with that pause, your calves and the arch of your Achilles have to work a little bit harder.

101
00:06:22,577 --> 00:06:26,418
If this is a little too extreme for you and you're getting a burn, you can go ahead and alternate.

102
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:30,760
just simply rotating each foot heel to toe.

103
00:06:33,182 --> 00:06:40,088
Again, make sure you're breathing, keeping your core tight, shoulders back, chest up, proper posture.

104
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:42,210
You don't wanna be hunching over.

105
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,472
For one, it's hard to breathe that way.

106
00:06:45,312 --> 00:06:47,875
Two, it doesn't look good on anyone.

107
00:06:50,797 --> 00:06:53,239
If you wanna finish out, you can go back up to regular calf raises.

108
00:06:55,486 --> 00:06:56,407
Check in with yourself.

109
00:06:57,448 --> 00:07:03,393
Remember, the hardest part is showing up, so I'm proud of you for just even gauging, making the attempt.

110
00:07:03,613 --> 00:07:04,674
You'll get better over time.

111
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:07,576
Rome was not built in a day.

112
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:11,880
Going back to alternating if you like.

113
00:07:13,882 --> 00:07:15,263
We have 10 more seconds here.

114
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:19,827
The next exercise will be good mornings.

115
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:23,090
You'll be placing your hands behind your head.

116
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:28,310
Go ahead and make sure you still have a shoulder-width stance.

117
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,112
Placing your feet, make sure you're dead center.

118
00:07:32,273 --> 00:07:34,114
Hands behind your head, draw in your core.

119
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:36,696
Make sure you're breathing and held your nose.

120
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:39,338
And you're just gonna hinge at the hips.

121
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,322
Meaning that your hips are gonna extend outward behind you, and up nice and slow.

122
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:51,567
Find whatever cadence is most comfortable for you.

123
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:53,569
One, two, three, pause.

124
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:55,250
One, two, three, up.

125
00:07:56,604 --> 00:07:58,586
Keep your core tight, one, two, three, pause.

126
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:00,788
One, two, three, up.

127
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,550
You'll feel this in your hamstrings.

128
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:08,334
You're gonna probably feel this in your calves a bit too, because we just finished doing calf raises.

129
00:08:12,398 --> 00:08:22,327
So this is a good mobility, full body warmup, lymphatic drainage, in addition to helping with your circulation.

130
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,860
Nice and smooth.

131
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:30,082
Down nice and slow.

132
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:31,322
Pause.

133
00:08:33,783 --> 00:08:34,604
Up nice and smooth.

134
00:08:35,804 --> 00:08:39,326
Let's go down by four, pause for four, and up for four.

135
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,587
One, two, three, four, pause.

136
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:45,929
One, two, three, four, up.

137
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:49,510
One, two, three, four, back down.

138
00:08:58,564 --> 00:09:00,244
Please make sure you're not holding your breath.

139
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:06,666
Make sure you're breathing.

140
00:09:07,427 --> 00:09:09,907
Periodically, you can take that deep, cleansing breath.

141
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:11,848
Inhale through the nose.

142
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,069
Blow out through the mouth.

143
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:23,172
If you're not certain that you're breathing, because sometimes we do shallow breathing, you can actually make a sound with your breath.

144
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,721
All right, now it's time to cool down.

145
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:32,222
You guys are almost there.

146
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:33,443
Arms down.

147
00:09:34,303 --> 00:09:37,105
We're just gonna do hip sways, and that's literally what you're gonna do.

148
00:09:37,846 --> 00:09:39,066
You're just rocking back and forth.

149
00:09:42,288 --> 00:09:44,349
If you want, you can do rocks and circles.

150
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:47,611
Hands on your hips.

151
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:53,134
This is primarily, like I said, for a warmup.

152
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:55,876
Also, just to get you used to the equipment.

153
00:10:01,563 --> 00:10:02,684
Go ahead and alternate.

154
00:10:02,704 --> 00:10:08,629
You can go the opposite way, or you can just stick with the sways.

155
00:10:14,374 --> 00:10:16,736
Want to spice things up a bit, go ahead and add your arms.

156
00:10:22,181 --> 00:10:23,322
Deep, cleansing breaths.

157
00:10:26,745 --> 00:10:29,047
We're gonna go back to calf raises.

158
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,801
Just 30 seconds.

159
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:34,821
Here we go.

160
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:52,454
Once again, if calf raises is too difficult, use a chair, a wall, countertop, or alternate.

161
00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:55,617
Just toe to heel, alternate feet.

162
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:05,929
We're stopping in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

163
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:15,379
Thanks Sunny fam, I appreciate it.

164
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:16,440
See you guys next time.

165
00:11:18,952 --> 00:11:23,136
