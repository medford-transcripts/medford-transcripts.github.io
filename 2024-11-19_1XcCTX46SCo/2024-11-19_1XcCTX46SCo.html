    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=213.422s">I</a>  will be brief, but Mr. Carr definitely held a towering presence in the community, and I've been more than lucky to serve on boards with his children and also go to Medford Public Schools with his grandchildren, and I will leave it at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=233.587s">He</a>  will certainly be missed.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=235.208s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=235.968s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=238.933s">Councilor</a>  interjecting.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=246.102s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=246.442s">I</a>  know that when I saw this, I got a phone call from Bill Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=252.424s">that</a>  Mr. Carr has passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=253.904s">And</a>  I know how the family had worked to bless him with the wishes that he live and die like he lived. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=263.147s">And</a>  he was just an amazing person. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=266.728s">He</a>  battled. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=267.588s">He</a>  taught his family how to live and how to live for their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=273.846s">From</a>  South Medford where the Carr family started, to West Medford and Hillside coaching Little League, to the classrooms at Medford High School and the guidance Councilor office at Medford High, Mr. Carr touched a lot of people's lives in a very positive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=291.525s">And</a>  again, I've been saying this for the years that I've been on the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=295.087s">We're</a>  seeing too many Method legends pass on, and not enough people picking up the torch where people like Mr. Carr have left off. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=305.333s">What</a>  he did do is he did teach his children to give back to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=309.476s">And</a>  we know both Bill and Doug have given their lives to Medford, and they're always behind the scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=316.64s">You</a>  never see them a lot like Mr. Carr. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=321.003s">you</a>  know, a true Mustang, a true legend, a BC, a love of Boston College, and a person that would be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=331.609s">I</a>  know that tomorrow's his wake and Thursday's his send off, and I'm sure we'll see a lot of grateful people for knowing Mr. Carr and his family, and someone that will be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=345.177s">So</a>  my condolences to the family, and <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=348.859s">If</a>  you have a minute, read his obituary, and it speaks volumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=352.96s">And</a>  maybe, maybe if a constituent reads that and says, geez, let me pick up just a little bit of what Mr. Carr has done for our community, you can make such impacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=364.404s">And</a>  that's what he's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=365.344s">So</a>  bless him. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=367.265s">And</a>  thank you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=369.526s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Pelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=370.186s">Thank</a>  you for the discussion from the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=372.887s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=373.747s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=375.207s">Bill</a>  Carr was a great Mustang. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=378.112s">pillar</a>  of the community, father and grandfather, teacher, coach, community activist, good elk, a member of Post 45, American Legion, veteran, served his country and this community well, some that I have fond memories of that will sadly be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=394.603s">It's</a>  all too often that we're up here celebrating people and the achievements and contributions that they make to our community after their passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=404.576s">And</a>  this is one of those instances where I think we should have taken an opportunity to look at the contributions that Mr. Carr had made to this community and maybe had the chance to honour him while he was still with us because he is someone that certainly has made a difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of families in this community.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=419.373s">Thank</a>  you Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=421.415s">Any</a>  further discussion from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=424.372s">Briefly,</a>  I didn't have the pleasure of knowing Mr. Carr, but I have worked with and interacted with his sons, and if his family's dedication to the city is any indication, it's truly a great loss for the city, and he will be sorely missed, and I send my condolences to his family. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=438.719s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Caraviello and Vice-President Bears, seconded by- Second. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=443.681s">Councilor</a>  Tseng, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1178.789s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1179.71s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello, for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1183.447s">you</a>  know, in addition to what you said, you know, who is implementing the recommendations that came out of the cyber security analysis that we were told was such a dire issue as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1193.297s">So,</a>  I mean, that goes right to your point. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1194.819s">But,</a>  you know, we were told we have a serious cyber security problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1199.484s">And</a>  as far as I can tell, there's nobody in that office <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1203.648s">at</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1204.429s">The</a>  website was down for a few hours earlier this week, which is a persistent problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1210.875s">Earlier</a>  this year, the website was down for days and weeks at a time, which is not good when folks are looking for essential information and services from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1219.664s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1222.3s">not</a>  to drive home a point that I drive home a little too much, maybe, but not only is there no one working in that office, we don't have any sort of idea what the capital plan is to invest in information technology and technology services across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1236.668s">The</a>  more that I learn on a weekly and monthly basis about <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1240.738s">the</a>  fact that we're purchasing an email contact system, but we're buying multiple accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1244.841s">So</a>  one department may collect contact information and another department may collect contact information. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1249.545s">And</a>  when they email folks, you know, updates from the city, not everybody on both those lists gets the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1255.57s">It's</a>  just, you know, really basic coordination problems that could go a long way to solving a major problem that we have in the community, which is <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1262.872s">community</a>  outreach issues and community education issues about initiatives that are going on in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1268.475s">We</a>  spoke about it recently about outreach on, I think maybe solid waste task force or something else, but the fact that these systems aren't integrated is a huge problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1278.841s">We</a>  don't have an idea or an amount of money of capital that's gonna be invested in this, and now we don't have any staff that are managing it at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1285.425s">So</a>  I'll leave it there, but thank you for bringing this up, and I hope that we can <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1292.267s">start</a>  doing better.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1511.402s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1512.683s">I'm</a>  tired of getting these phone calls from people about the tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1516.266s">I</a>  mean, whole streets are getting tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1519.288s">And</a>  I know we're having a meeting with them tomorrow, but I find it hard to believe that the old parking method went in there and changed everybody's address. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1530.196s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1530.516s">It</a>  doesn't sound like something anybody would ever do. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1535.2s">This</a>  is something that's got to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1537.922s">I</a>  mean, you're giving 40, 50 tickets a night for streets that don't even exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1543.527s">So</a>  the people of Wellington got tagged last week for Fulbright Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1547.411s">There</a>  isn't a house on Fulbright Street in the same method. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1550.493s">There's</a>  a car wash there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1552.875s">And</a>  we're giving tickets for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1556.145s">Members,</a>  I'm going to make the motion that all tickets for Premier Parking cease tonight until this issue of the addresses with Premier Parking are addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1567.848s">These</a>  people can't get any tickets, they got to appeal, they got to come back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1571.549s">I</a>  mean, it's utterly ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1574.67s">And</a>  I know we're talking about it tomorrow night, but this is something I wanted to get out there tonight.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1579.971s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviellol.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1582.15s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1583.391s">I've</a>  received similar calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1586.793s">You</a>  would think that if it's truly a database problem, which I have no reason to believe it's not a database problem, but even if it's a database problem, then you have an entire street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1599.581s">And</a>  you're enforcement, and you go down the street, and every single car you pass pings as being ticketed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1605.39s">That</a>  should raise a red flag, especially if you already know you have a database problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1609.274s">It</a>  should be practice that goes out to the enforcement officers to say, hey, we have some issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1614.52s">There's</a>  been a couple of streets when we've gone down for permits that all the data was messed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1618.985s">If</a>  you hit 10 cars in a row on a street, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1622.393s">double</a>  no hold off come back and we were going to check if it's a database problem I mean there's kind of a simple check here that you could implement where if you have an issue in your database and suddenly you're ticketing 20 cars on the street which you know is abnormal because it's just not <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1639.713s">what</a>  your normal practice is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1641.975s">That</a>  should, you know, raise a red flag, say we're going to hold off, we're going to come back, we're going to make sure the data is right before we permit the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1649.121s">The</a>  other thing I want to add is that I've also heard problems on the flip side of this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1653.445s">There's</a>  some areas of the city where residents fought, you know, got the petition signed, went there, got the permit parking on their street, have had enforcement for months or years where <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1665.423s">Now,</a>  because the coordination didn't happen at the top level, the Medford police can't go out and enforce permit parking because they've never been trained on the license plate parking system. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1678.706s">And</a>  so it's not just on the side of people are getting tickets that they shouldn't be getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1683.347s">There's</a>  also streets that are now filling back up that are permit streets with commuters parking their cars, getting out of the car, walking to the train, walking to the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1692.543s">that</a>  should be getting tickets and it can't happen because the coordination between the police department and the parking department by the people who supervise both of those departments never happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1701.266s">So,</a>  you know, again, I'm not disputing your resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1704.447s">I'll</a>  vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1706.227s">You</a>  know, at this point, as Councilor Knight said, we know they're not listening to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1712.349s">So,</a>  but there's problems on both ends of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1715.71s">I</a>  think there are obviously solutions that can correct both of those problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1721.125s">At</a>  least on the on the issue of the police have been told now we're going to go train the police on the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1725.69s">So</a>  that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1726.45s">But</a>  it's again, there's serious coordination problems across all departments of government that are creating really negative outcomes for people who live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1734.979s">And</a>  it's a management issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1738.403s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1741.23s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1741.97s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Cabrera for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1745.032s">If</a>  you remember, the reason why years ago, when I was just a young man watching this council on TV, the biggest issues with parking in Medford is that you saw that people were using the streets, the side streets and main streets of Medford to park so they can hop on commuter buses and take parking for residents all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1767.384s">And</a>  that was the biggest issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1769.4s">Now</a>  it's turned into something that I believe, during the budget hearings, we talked about new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1778.286s">And</a>  I believe the majority of the new growth that is projected is coming from traffic and parking, if maybe someone correct me if I'm wrong, but from fines. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1787.872s">And</a>  that's a terrible way to run your community, on the backs and the pocketbooks and the wallets of your constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1796.192s">We're</a>  seeing major issues with this parking plan, and it seems like, and we'll talk about this tomorrow with the department head, but it seems like this has turned into just a moneymaker for this community, and it's for the wrong reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1810.877s">My</a>  recommendation is gonna be the same as Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1814.598s">I</a>  have constituents call me about this issue in Wellington, where the whole street was tagged, and when people came up to fight it, they said, we'll fix it, you just have to bring up your registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1826.93s">the</a>  constituents said to them, well, if you could see it in your computer and everybody on this street has gotten tickets because it says it's another street, why can't you change that? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1836.336s">Because</a>  we have residents that are elderly, that find it difficult to get their way to city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1841.36s">They</a>  want them to come up with their registrations, sit in an office that isn't very friendly from what I gather, and ask them to change this because they made a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1852.423s">I</a>  just don't understand the lack of preparation and the lack of transparency shared by this department and the lack of education that they haven't given our constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1866.467s">And</a>  again, I hate to harp on the communities that do it right, but whenever they implement any sort of change, it's something done 10 times. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1876.284s">It's</a>  put out to the community so everybody in the community understands why these plans and these parking enforcement penalties are in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1884.186s">So</a>  they're educated. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1887.387s">I</a>  saw one of the biggest increases in fees and fines in a community where I work in that would have made you sick in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1895.47s">But</a>  the way they unveiled it and the way they educated their constituents, explained to them, do you enjoy your streets getting swept twice a week? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1904.273s">Do</a>  you enjoy that we don't ask for any money for our school department, that we can give our teachers full benefits, that we can give them high salaries, that we can look at our paraprofessionals and pay $40,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1915.643s">Where</a>  do you think that's coming from? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1917.444s">It's</a>  coming from fees and fines, but it's understood by the constituents saying, well, if I made a mistake, and at least I know where that money's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1925.992s">In</a>  our community, we don't know why we're getting ticketed, who's giving the tickets, do they understand how they're giving tickets, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1933.288s">And</a>  then when someone has an issue, no one is actually talking to a person like a human being. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1938.011s">I've</a>  had very calm residents come to me and say, Councilor Scarpelli, I've gone to the office, I've tried to peacefully just ask a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1946.597s">I</a>  know it wasn't the wrong, but I just wanted to be educated. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1949.759s">And</a>  the lack of professionalism in that office, where it was smug people, people looking you right in the eye, raising their arms over their heads and yawning in your face. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1959.105s">I</a>  mean, this is customer service at its worst. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1962.296s">And</a>  this is gonna be something that's gonna be shared tomorrow, but I've welcomed all those people that have contacted me, come to this meeting, share your thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1971.478s">Because</a>  I think we need to put a, sometimes you need to stop everything and reassess so we can educate our constituents, educate the staff that's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1979.781s">Because</a>  from what I gather, I'm looking at complaints through the union that they're not being treated right either. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1987.803s">It's</a>  a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1990.336s">And</a>  it's disheartening that I know that, you know, constantly very somberly put where we are right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1996.939s">And</a>  this is disheartening. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2000.301s">This</a>  is disheartening. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2001.161s">Now</a>  I'm glad we can celebrate a road race and I'm glad we can celebrate trick or treating around the square and that's all fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2008.405s">And</a>  our constituents deserve that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2011.206s">We</a>  deserve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2012.687s">Don't</a>  get me wrong, we deserve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2015.078s">But</a>  that's not what runs the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2016.32s">Right</a>  now, I'm afraid what the next year's budget's gonna be. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2019.664s">We</a>  see the financial climate of this country right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2023.169s">I'm</a>  petrified to see what we... We saw what we went through last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2027.588s">And</a>  I think we need to reassess starting tomorrow evening with the Parking Enforcement Office and see where this council's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2034.31s">I</a>  see, and I'll jump ahead and I apologize, Madam President, but I see resolutions that are coming in front of us tonight that changing of ordinance for great people that have done a lot of work for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2045.872s">But</a>  out of all due respect, I was one councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2048.713s">How</a>  can I vote on something tonight where we don't have any guidance from a city solicitor? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2053.374s">We</a>  don't have any legal support from anybody in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2057.076s">whether</a>  the intentions of anything that's brought to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2060.087s">is</a>  good or bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2060.827s">We</a>  can't do anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2062.569s">So</a>  this is very frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2063.589s">I</a>  apologize, I digress, but it's been a very frustrating last few days, and I hope people show up tomorrow night and share their concerns, because I tell you what, the phone calls and the emails I've gotten, it's not even anything about just people being kind to each other, just showing respect to each other at a desk, and we can't even do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2085.222s">So</a>  thank you, and thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2086.903s">I</a>  support Councilor Caraviello's resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2089.205s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2089.747s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2090.207s">Councilor</a>  say.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2091.788s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2092.508s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2094.149s">I</a>  think Councilor Caraviello for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2097.531s">Um</a>  I've also gotten these calls and as as as Councilor Bears has put it, it is a bit ridiculous that you go on to a street notice that everything every car was registered to another street in Medford and <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2110.738s">It's</a>  not stop ticketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2112.74s">I</a>  think it's a logical step, given where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2116.662s">We</a>  need to do a real evaluation of the database and evaluation of the problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2123.127s">And</a>  we, as Councilor Beres has pointed out, we need better coordination with different departments as well to make sure that our enforcement is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2131.814s">And</a>  enforcement is going to be an especially important issue as Greenline Extension opens up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2137.818s">scheduled</a>  for November, but as we go through the parking commission's report, old report about South Medford parking, as we respond to what will be resident complaints about parking violations in South Medford as those stops open, we need to make sure that our house is in order and we need to make sure that our parking department and our city is ready <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2165.566s">to</a>  take on those challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2168.527s">Another</a>  issue that has been brought to me, and I think Councilor Scarpelli touched on it, is the difficulty of rectifying one's own situation, having to drive to City Hall, having to sit in the parking office. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2182.23s">I</a>  think we need to develop a process, this is my own opinion, where the parking department handles that autonomously and where <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2191.632s">it</a>  works easier for residents and we put less strain on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2195.535s">And</a>  we need to be looking at how we do refunds as well and make sure that people aren't unjustly paying for parking tickets that they didn't deserve in the first place, which is potentially, and I'm sure is a problem.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2216.302s">Um,</a>  I think what we need to do is stop the bleeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2219.464s">And</a>  councilor Caraviello is absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2221.025s">We</a>  need to stop issuing tickets for resident permit parking until mentioned or a mentioned parking department or whatever they go by these days can figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2231.873s">Um,</a>  ultimately this is a department that never should have been absorbed by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2238.077s">You</a>  don't have the capacity to run a parking department. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2241.119s">We're</a>  proving that daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2243.221s">We</a>  went from having a vendor that wrote us a check. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2246.738s">to</a>  a department that's come here before us now for over $800,000 in initial appropriations, and then another $200,000 or $300,000 in supplemental spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2257.506s">We're</a>  still not getting any satisfaction.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2260.328s">What</a>  information, Councilor Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2262.449s">And</a>  another $500,000 for meters that came out of the ARPA funds.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2268.774s">Now,</a>  we talk about reports, and we talk about committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2271.776s">Forget</a>  the reports, and forget the committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2273.317s">It's</a>  time to use common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2275.577s">When</a>  we talked about taking parking enforcement and doing it in-house, a committee was put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2282.66s">That</a>  committee came before this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2284.74s">And</a>  we spoke to that committee, and we said, please talk to us about resident parking, resident parking enforcement.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2290.743s">And</a>  what did that committee say? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2291.723s">Oh,</a>  we're not tasked to discuss that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2296.905s">But</a>  the recommendation was to take the parking in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2301.307s">How</a>  can we have a recommendation to do something without a full and complete assessment of what's going on?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2309.007s">When</a>  I say stop the bleeding, it's not just the tickets that are getting written. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2311.808s">What</a>  about non-renewals to the registries? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2313.909s">What</a>  about non-renewals for your license? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2315.51s">What</a>  about non-renewals for your registration? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2317.391s">Because</a>  of unpaid tickets that were issued unjustly that you can't get a remedy for here in City Hall.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2329.456s">We</a>  need to put the residents first in this regard.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2332.438s">That's</a>  what the parking program was established for, to put the residents first. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2336.34s">And</a>  we're not doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2338.268s">When</a>  we looked at, as Councilor Scarpelli said, the history of parking enforcement in Medford and why this program came to fruition, it was to turn over spots in the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2347.815s">That's</a>  what it was initially proposed for. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2351.537s">It</a>  wasn't to go into the neighborhoods, to go down Sylvia Road, a dead end street, and give people tickets when they've been able to police themselves and have no parking complaints for 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2364.573s">It</a>  doesn't make sense to me that the Metro parking department is driving down Wellington Road when Wellington Road hasn't complained about a parking issue in 25 years, but the residents of Goldsmith Ave have been going on C-Click fix for the last six months and asking for relief and no avail. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2382.365s">It</a>  just doesn't make sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2384.066s">We</a>  have problem areas that are being identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2386.949s">through</a>  these tools and modules that the mayor has touted as being so effective in the delivery of city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2393.794s">But</a>  then we're not using the data that we're collecting from these modules to make decisions.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2397.797s">There's</a>  no data-driven decision-making at all going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2404.322s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2405.423s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2406.103s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2406.864s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2408.385s">One</a>  thing I find problematic today <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2413.947s">I</a>  don't have it in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2415.108s">Do</a>  we have someone from the city administration here representing the city anymore? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2418.872s">Do</a>  we have someone? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2420.634s">Is</a>  there someone on zoom that just just just to relay these messages to the mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2424.978s">Is</a>  it on that note?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2426.3s">I</a>  know that it's <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2429.733s">Hispanic</a>  Heritage Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2430.694s">It's</a>  also today's national no excuse day. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2434.356s">So</a>  I hope someone from the administration is on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2436.717s">Madam</a>  President, if they can bring that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2438.138s">I</a>  do not see anyone.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2439.138s">I</a>  do know the interim chief of staff is unable to attend council meetings due to just prior just scheduling issues.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2446.603s">So</a>  we so okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2447.703s">So</a>  in essence, right now, we don't have any, any representation to discuss any concerns and issues from our community from from the mayor's office.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2456.193s">I</a>  do not see one. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2458.154s">In</a>  advance I can invite specific people.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2460.656s">If</a>  we can, just because this is our second meeting now after the summer break and we have issues and concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2468.185s">it</a>  could be something that could be answered quickly through someone from the mayor's office and not having someone, I know that the chief of staff isn't here, but there should be someone here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2477.089s">They</a>  have a lot of people in that office, if I'm not mistaken, that could represent that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2482.191s">So</a>  I'd actually put that in the form of a motion that if we can, that we request that someone from the city administration staff represents the city hall in our meetings to answer <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2496.537s">constituent</a>  services concerns or issues in a media basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2499.479s">So</a>  I really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2501.621s">I</a>  mean, considering only meet twice a month now, that I think it's important that we have someone here that it's, you know, I don't think we're scary anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2509.246s">I</a>  think we've all toned it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2510.687s">I</a>  don't think we're bullying anybody anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2512.608s">I</a>  think we're in a good place. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2513.549s">So</a>  if we can do that, Madam President, I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2515.85s">And</a>  it's also chocolate milk. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2518.84s">today</a>  is uh if you look at the it's uh it's a very important day forget about not only hispanic heritage month and it's also we have very it's we went over that this morning that's why i know that director said today's a very important day for chocolate milk believe it or not do you want to make that a beat paper please please that'd be great thank you i'm just sorry a point of information as well on that point um</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2548.297s">I</a>  appreciate President Morell's deference to say, you know, we can always do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2551.46s">I</a>  think that's the attitude we should be having in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2554.103s">We</a>  could, you know, we could ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2556.241s">send</a>  it in, you know, we can send it in embossed and engraved and certified mail letter to have someone come to this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2562.584s">But</a>  this leadership team has gone above and beyond when it comes to getting out a monthly schedule, getting it in front of all the department heads, putting out a regular meeting schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2571.367s">You</a>  know, I work with the clerk on this and President Morell on this on a weekly and monthly basis to say, hey, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2579.37s">you</a>  know, something that we hadn't done before, here's a month's worth. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2583.032s">We're</a>  going to get you four weeks notice on some of these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2585.573s">We're</a>  going to try to get out to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2586.934s">I</a>  know Councilor Collins and myself and other chairs of subcommittees have done equal work to get information in front of people, to talk not just to the solicitor, but directly to people at KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2598.881s">I</a>  mean, you know, I just want to be very clear that it's not a lack of effort on our end <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2605.404s">as</a>  to why we're not seeing people show up here to be part of our deliberations. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2610.868s">And</a>  given what we've experienced really since June, and even before that, obviously, but especially since June, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2618.757s">It</a>  doesn't seem unintentional. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2621.078s">And</a>  I just want to say that, you know, we're not, we haven't stopped any of the things that we do to reach out and invite people to participate in a collaborative way as part of this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2630.162s">It's</a>  just that when we reach out our hand, no one grabs it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2633.644s">No</a>  one shows up and people don't collaborate. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2635.825s">And</a>  sometimes when they do come, they tell us, hey, we can't, we're not, we're not going to collaborate. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2640.087s">That's</a>  been some of the most frustrating piece of this for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2643.288s">is</a>  hearing, well, that's not our charge, or that's not our duty, or, you know, the council's working on too many ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2649.334s">It</a>  used to be only did one ordinance a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2651.416s">That</a>  has been stuck in my head ever since it was said out loud four months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2657.141s">Nothing</a>  changes if nothing changes, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2660.324s">And</a>  we're working on change.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2662.065s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Bears, and thank you for that reminder of all the work we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2664.648s">And</a>  then I have Councilor Collins, I'll go back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2666.229s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2668.056s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2669.117s">I</a>  don't want to belabor this point because we're going to have the whole meeting devoted to parking tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2673.281s">But</a>  I just wanted to say in advance of that, you know, I know we've been fielding so many resident complaints about parking, and we've been hearing indeed from the parking department itself about the challenges that they're perceiving and working through. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2686.872s">And</a>  I know that <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2688.464s">logical</a>  thing that anybody does is when there's a problem, you look, where did this come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2693.365s">Who's</a>  responsible? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2694.025s">Whose</a>  fault is this? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2695.746s">And</a>  I know we're gonna be hearing it directly from the horse's mouth tomorrow, but I just wanna, I feel like we need to lay the foundation for that conversation with, was our parking department, you know, whether it was right or wrong to bring them in house this year when we did, were they set up to succeed or were they set up to fail? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2713.71s">You</a>  know, because that decision was made <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2716.285s">before</a>  anybody got hired. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2718.166s">That</a>  decision is unattached to anybody currently in that department. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2722.107s">And</a>  I'm not saying that the department has done everything perfectly because we all know that's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2726.909s">We've</a>  gotten the phone calls about it, but I think it needs to undergird the conversation that we have with the people in that office directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2734.852s">The</a>  context has to be, what did they know before their work began? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2739.834s">What</a>  did they know about the scope of their work? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2741.515s">What</a>  did they know about the Park Medford that was there before? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2746.795s">Were</a>  they given the true and authentic lay of the land? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2750.398s">Were</a>  they given the resources that they really needed to succeed? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2754.762s">That's</a>  part of the equation too. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2756.043s">I</a>  just want to put that out there.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2757.504s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2757.704s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2758.605s">Councilor</a>  Knight, then we'll go to public comment.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2760.366s">Madam</a>  President, I just, I do want to point out that these failures are really managerial failures. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2765.47s">And,</a>  you know, when we talk about the human resource problems that we have there in our community and the human resource crisis that's going on here in Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2774.428s">In</a>  our packets this evening when we got here, we have charges, additional charges that were brought forward by local 25 who represent our parking enforcement officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2785.253s">And</a>  it appears to me that the administration's not exactly treating them in the kind of fashion as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2792.377s">Tracking</a>  devices and cameras, randomly changing our, randomly changing schedules from night to day and day to night. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2799.54s">I</a>  mean, imagine having a family and having your schedule randomly changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2802.161s">Next</a>  week you're working nights, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2806.653s">I</a>  wonder why the program isn't working. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2810.296s">We</a>  need to invest in the people that are doing the work in order to make the program successful.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2816.621s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Nay. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2817.642s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2819.003s">Discussion</a>  from members of the public, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2823.627s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Anita Nagem]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2830.393s">This</a>  is a parking-related issue, not directly related to this enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2835.935s">it</a>  would lead to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2837.456s">I</a>  wanted to come and speak to you after the last Traffic Commission meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2841.317s">At</a>  that meeting, the Traffic Commission was voting on whether to make permit parking or extend permit parking around the new Green Line station all the way to Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2853.943s">Initially,</a>  they were going to make it a quarter mile radius around the station, then it increased a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2859.813s">Suddenly</a>  at the beginning of September, it was going to be all the way to Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2864.694s">There</a>  was very little notice given. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2867.374s">I</a>  live on Norton Avenue, which is an extremely small private way, which runs between North Street and Lyman Ave, close to Route 16, close to the Whole Foods. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2878.816s">Our</a>  street is, when I say small, whenever I call the DPW about something, they say, oh, Norton Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2889.682s">There's</a>  barely enough room on our street for people to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2892.444s">There's</a>  no room for sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2894.525s">Whenever</a>  we have visitors, they have to park on either Lyman or North Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2899.448s">Whenever</a>  anyone has any renovation work done or any kind of big truck needs to come on the street, at least half the residents have to park on either North Street or Lyman Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2910.435s">If</a>  there was a lot of snow, like the winter of 2015, or any snow that doesn't melt, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2917.751s">some</a>  of us have to usually park there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2920.352s">When</a>  I asked the traffic commission about whether, or actually not the traffic commission, the city engineer about whether if they made permit parking in the area that people on Norton Ave would be able to get variances, he sent me a message back saying that the houses that abut North Street would be able to get variance and the rest of us may in italics be able to get one. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2948.144s">The</a>  discussion at the meeting initially, the traffic commission meeting was about making permit parking, but having it street by street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2955.727s">As</a>  more and more public comments came in, they started discussing, well, maybe we could make it zone parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2961.769s">And</a>  it was very vague and clearly it was not thought through very carefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2968.392s">Not</a>  allowing residents of a street like Norton Avenue to get variances to park if this was all made permit parking would be devastating. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2977.853s">It</a>  would also be devastating for the residents of Walkland Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2981.894s">There</a>  is almost no parking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2983.734s">I</a>  know a number of residents who depend on their vehicles to maintain their independence. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2991.116s">Quite</a>  a few of them park on either North Street or Auburn, sometimes other streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2996.477s">I've</a>  been in that area for 35 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2998.258s">It</a>  has never been an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3002.488s">The</a>  way this situation is developing now, I mean, I have extreme concerns about whether this proposal will be implemented to make the entire area permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3015.914s">It</a>  has been tabled for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3018.395s">They're</a>  gonna wait until the Green Line station opens, but this is not a one size fits all solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3026.719s">People</a>  really need to think about the consequences again, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3031.532s">Norton</a>  have residents would either be trapped in their driveways or prevented from getting home if we could not park on adjacent streets as necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3043.478s">And</a>  I hope that the council will bring up this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3048.0s">There</a>  was no discussion with residents of my area <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3052.097s">before</a>  this proposal was put before the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3055.218s">I</a>  know that a lot of streets have gotten together and gotten petitions together to have the streets made permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3061.439s">None</a>  of that was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3062.419s">It</a>  was just a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3064.259s">We</a>  got a message saying, we're voting on this at the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3069.16s">I</a>  really hope that the council will bring up this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3074.621s">Zone</a>  parking is the minimum that they would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3078.27s">But</a>  if it is made zone parking, and they actually do vote on this and it goes through, residents of private ways, residents of places like Walkland Court need to be able to get variances to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3092.115s">And</a>  there's really no other option for any of us, or the people on my street, people in Walkland Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3102.64s">And</a>  I really hope that the council will press the Traffic Commission on this <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3106.705s">This</a>  is going to come up again for a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3108.267s">They're</a>  going to discuss it again, November,

    <p>[Steven South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3121.158s">Steven</a>  South 106 Damon Road, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3125.263s">Also</a>  the secretary treasurer of Teamsters Local 25 and coincidentally, we represent as one of our groups, the parking department. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3133.354s">So</a>  I want to deal with facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3137.158s">I</a>  often <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3138.6s">speak</a>  to you and give you packets of information because I want you to have the facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3142.382s">So</a>  I want to give you some of those right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3145.183s">Number</a>  one, that when this part department was created, I think the city put the cart before the horse. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3152.966s">So</a>  in January, the city hired a bunch of employees before they even had meters and a plan on how to conduct a parking program within the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3163.09s">Well,</a>  that being said, there was very little, if any, training for a lot of the employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3169.293s">There</a>  was a high turnover. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3170.994s">Several</a>  of the initial employees quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3172.955s">They've</a>  hired new ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3174.575s">Little</a>  to no training again. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3176.096s">And</a>  if you look at the packet that I gave you, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3181.059s">Councilor</a>  Knight was correct that there have been many unfair labor practices charges filed by the union on behalf of the employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3190.348s">So</a>  I just want you to see the climate that they're working in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3194.653s">So</a>  some of the charges are as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3198.083s">Their</a>  schedules can change from day to day, from day to night. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3201.525s">So</a>  if someone calls in sick, they say, Steve, we know your days, but tomorrow you're on nights and the next day you're on days and the next day you're on nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3208.948s">They're</a>  severely short-staffed right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3211.249s">So</a>  they're just bouncing people around. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3213.63s">We</a>  filed another unfair labor practice charge with the state regarding a recent change that were made to their schedules, which as I know it, it's the first in the state <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3226.396s">And</a>  that's where the city unilaterally changed these workers' work schedule to a six-day schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3233.46s">That's</a>  just to get their 40 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3235.521s">They</a>  work eight hours Monday, eight hours Tuesday, eight hours Wednesday, eight hours Thursday, four hours on Friday, four hours on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3245.805s">So</a>  they have six days of work just to get their regular 40-hour shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3250.388s">There's</a>  no overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3252.229s">And</a>  they get one day with their families on Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3256.752s">They</a>  put body cameras, without negotiating with Local 25, they put body cameras on the employees, all the employees in this department. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3265.514s">Did</a>  the police even have body cameras in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3268.255s">I</a>  mean, certainly it's a mandatory subject of collective bargaining, and the city just forgot to talk to us about it, and unilaterally forced these workers to wear body cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3280.348s">The</a>  staff in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3282.471s">Again,</a>  the city unilaterally put up cameras in the office with audio and video without bargaining with the union. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3293.023s">So</a>  the employees on the street have cameras and the employees in the office have cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3303.042s">The</a>  last point that I wanna make, and again, I know it's easy to, you guys are getting a lot of complaints, and I'm sure a lot of them are valid, but it's very easy to blame the low-level rank-and-file employees who, by the way, I talk to on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3319.96s">they're</a>  working as directed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3321.361s">So</a>  I just want to point that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3322.703s">And</a>  I know everybody's upset and people in the, in the chamber here are upset and people on zoom are upset and some of you are upset, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3330.17s">I</a>  understand, but these employees, the parking control officers, the repair people, the clerical people, they're working as directed at the direction of the mayor and her administration, HR, chief staff, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3344.044s">they're</a>  working as directed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3345.465s">So</a>  I just want to point that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3347.106s">The</a>  employees are very low paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3349.087s">They're</a>  lower paid than all the other communities, which we represent several of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3355.09s">They're</a>  very low paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3356.13s">They</a>  have very low benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3357.531s">We're</a>  in negotiations now, of course, like all the other units, the city's offering nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3364.054s">And</a>  it's a common theme throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3366.995s">So</a>  respectfully to all of you, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3370.257s">Madam</a>  Chairman, Councilors, I just want to make sure that everyone sees the complete picture and that the rank and file, the low level people that are just trying to feed their families don't feel the brunt of this when it's managerial decisions that are driving these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3385.741s">I</a>  thank you for your kind attention.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3387.562s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3387.902s">We</a>  do have one person on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3389.862s">Would</a>  you like to go first, President Bears?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3392.303s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3393.143s">And</a>  Mr. South, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3395.044s">I</a>  just want to be clear, and I think all of us were on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3400.782s">should</a>  be at the management level, and it's a coordination problem when we're talking about these permits or these database things. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3407.705s">If</a>  this has happened one time, why isn't the director or whoever it may be saying, we can't let this happen again, let's train our workers with the sufficient training to recognize this problem and not have it happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3423.372s">So</a>  I just wanted to add that to the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3425.813s">I</a>  think we're all in agreement that there's coordination problems at the top levels that are causing <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3430.735s">serious</a>  issues.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3432.776s">Going</a>  to G to Stefano on Zoom and then we'll come back to you Mr. Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3437.898s">G</a>  to Stefano, name and address for the record please. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3440.839s">I</a>  just asked you to unmute.</p>

    <p>[Gary DeStefano]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3442.439s">31</a>  Goldsmith Ave, Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3447.061s">And</a>  I sent out an email to the crew of you and I appreciate the replies I got back. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3454.664s">And</a>  it's interesting, today I was at the parking department and I renewed my permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3461.673s">and</a>  there's this thing that's called a parking permit portal. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3466.798s">I</a>  got it up in front of me and it says from 6-28-2016 to 9-29-2022 that I lived on Granville Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3479.188s">I</a>  have never lived on Granville Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3481.75s">So</a>  now I understand what part of the problems are is yeah okay it truly is a database problem and maybe that's why we're not getting tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3489.817s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3490.593s">The</a>  police department, if they run your license plate, they should be able to tell what street you're on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3495.775s">So</a>  I understand Councilor Caraviello not wanting to give tickets out for permit parking, and I'll accept that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3504.419s">But</a>  if a resident calls the police department non-emergency number, because vehicles are parked in front of your house 36 hours straight, I think the police should still be able to give out the tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3521.055s">until</a>  this problem is fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3524.176s">That's</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3526.857s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3527.157s">Could</a>  you actually repeat your name and address for the record, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3529.358s">We</a>  just couldn't hear it.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3545.343s">and</a>  address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3547.286s">State</a>  Merit 373 Riverside Ave in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3549.449s">I</a>  live on a small, narrow street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3552.093s">Riverside</a>  Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3553.955s">It's</a>  not a side street.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3555.998s">Can</a>  you park on Riverside Ave if you're not in a driveway? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3561.526s">The</a>  answer is no.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3563.757s">So</a>  I think some, I appreciate what some of the Councilors have said tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3568.638s">I</a>  was watching this on TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3570.438s">I</a>  had to come down because my kid didn't want to watch this on TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3572.999s">He'd</a>  rather watch Paw Patrol. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3575.999s">I</a>  don't blame him. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3576.779s">I'm</a>  sure some of all of us would too. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3579.92s">I</a>  think that there's a lot of, I'll call them corner cases that maybe where some of these blanket policies don't address, you know, if you live on Riverside Ave and you're having work done in your house and you can't pull into your driveway, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3593.771s">and</a>  you don't have a permit and you come down to the parking office and they say, no, you can't have a permit to park on this side street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3602.274s">Really?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3602.534s">No,</a>  because you don't live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3604.875s">No,</a>  I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3605.395s">But</a>  if I actually want to go to work so I can pay my mortgage, pay my taxes, pay the salaries of the fine people working in that office, what am I supposed to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3616.499s">So</a>  I think a lot of care and consideration needs to be taken before some blanket policies are put out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3624.126s">I</a>  really appreciate Councilor Knight, something that you brought up, which was, you know, what is the purpose of having parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3632.548s">What's</a>  the scope? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3634.049s">Is</a>  the intent to make money for the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3639.27s">Or</a>  is it instead to keep people from say parking on Governor's Ave and kind of abusing the parking and preventing other people from coming into the city and shopping? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3650.663s">It</a>  feels like the scope has been lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3653.165s">If</a>  you wanna tax your citizens, tax it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3657.248s">If</a>  you're gonna have people pay, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3663.032s">But</a>  at least come out and say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3666.335s">But</a>  at least come out and say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3668.416s">Because</a>  if you're having people pay to come shop and spend money in the city of Medford, and most of those people are your residents, then that's in effect a tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3681.575s">If</a>  it's to keep people from say outside the city, you know, from parking and abusing and using the commuter access that we have, that's a different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3692.606s">And</a>  there's different ways to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3694.387s">So</a>  the city of Arlington, town of Arlington, I think it's a town. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3698.331s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3700.493s">Do</a>  they have a parking department enforcement and stickers? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3703.977s">When</a>  I lived in Arlington, I didn't have a sticker and I was a resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3707.519s">I</a>  could park on the side and all I had to do is like if I had an extenuating circumstances, you call Arlington PD and say, hi, I'd like to park my car on the street because they have no on street parking for the most part, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3718.388s">They</a>  have a, the process is communication and otherwise, okay, we know that plate number. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3725.253s">We're</a>  not going to ticket it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3727.675s">It</a>  works pretty good as far as I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3730.017s">City</a>  of Cambridge, you can have a parking permit, you get a sticker and that sticker is, you know, it's a permanent resident sticker. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3736.125s">and</a>  you can park anywhere in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3738.847s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, how does it work in Sutton-Merville where you work?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3742.311s">Is</a>  it similar? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3743.251s">It's</a>  expensive, but it's pretty well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3744.673s">I</a>  mean, they run their program, if you have a parking sticker, I believe it's increased now to $180 per car, but it's citywide and it's run pretty well.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3757.281s">I</a>  mean, there's a lot of different ideas in here, and I think we need to find something that fits for Medford, but let's keep in mind the scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3763.324s">If</a>  the scope is to raise revenue for the city, that's one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3766.825s">If</a>  the objective is different and it's to keep people from abusing streets and preventing people from coming outside the city to spend money in our city, which is, I think, what everyone wants, that's a whole different objective. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3778.83s">So</a>  I appreciate y'all maybe keeping that in mind as we go forward and maybe trying to refocus the scope.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3788.117s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3789.558s">I</a>  think I'm the only councilor that was here when the other parking program was started. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3794.94s">And</a>  the scope was, as Councilor Scott Feldman I think said, was to stop the people from parking in the business areas and taking train going to Boston and taking the bus and doing all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3807.886s">And</a>  it worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3808.886s">And</a>  it did work and it did what its job was to open up spots in the business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3816.619s">But</a>  what they didn't do was they weren't going into the neighborhoods and tagging people for these little tiki tac things. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3825.764s">And</a>  I think that's where we've gone astray. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3831.847s">And</a>  I can't speak for my other Councilors, I've only gotten <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3837.513s">two</a>  calls from businesses complaining about tagging in the business areas, where when Park Method first came in, the phone rang off the hook. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3845.321s">But,</a>  oh, you know, you're tagging my customers and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3848.825s">But</a>  I say it's changed now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3851.788s">The</a>  only calls I got, I got a call from the Haines Square community, the business group that come down there, because they <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3858.938s">People</a>  were pulling up at the 30-minute signs, and the minute they pulled up, they were getting a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3865.402s">And</a>  I actually videoed the guy one day, and I asked him, I says, why are you giving this person a ticket? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3870.346s">She</a>  was here two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3871.847s">Those</a>  are fake signs up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3874.849s">Because</a>  as I say, it had been going on for weeks at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3878.271s">And</a>  I did bring that to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3881.093s">I</a>  don't know where it's going, but the calls from Haines Square were stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3884.135s">But</a>  as I say, all the calls we're getting now are from the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3889.205s">No</a>  more calls from the business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3892.047s">And</a>  I say, I think we've lost our way on what we're trying to accomplish on this parking program now.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3899.291s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3901.573s">Going</a>  to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3904.234s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3907.156s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Cushing Street Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3914.233s">My</a>  gut feeling says we do have a major problem with the parking department um, I went through it firsthand to get my registration and new license renewed And a very very unfunny thing happened to me on the way to the forum the parking forum um Bottom line is I have too much information. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3937.746s">You</a>  don't want to hear it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3939.507s">However,</a>  it is my understanding <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3942.273s">that</a>  the problem lies supposedly with Park Method, the previous bounty hunter, as Penta would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3952.655s">I</a>  don't know if that's true, but we're in a big mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3956.436s">I</a>  guess Councilor X, what was his name? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3961.636s">Mr.</a>  Caraviello would know, but he used to say, what we have here is a lack of proper communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3970.656s">I</a>  don't know what's going on, but it is terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3973.196s">Good</a>  night.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3975.277s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Mastigati.</p>

    <p>[Anita Nagem]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3979.598s">Anita</a>  Nagum, 9 Norton AF. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3981.598s">There's</a>  just one more thing I would like to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3983.898s">The</a>  previous speaker touched on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3986.259s">The</a>  permits that they are considering in the area of the Green Line station would be in effect 24 hours a day, six days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3994.5s">If</a>  the intent is to prevent people from parking and taking the T in, it would seem that <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4000.495s">maybe</a>  permit parking from eight to five would be sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4004.796s">If</a>  the intent seems to be to raise revenue, by all means put it in 24 hours a day, six days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4013.078s">I'd</a>  like to point out to you that there are a lot of rental apartments in Hillside where tough students live. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4021.08s">They</a>  move in and out frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4024.515s">any</a>  of them moving in, if this were implemented 24 hours a day, six days a week, would almost certainly be in violation as soon as they try to move in or out of their apartments. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4036.664s">I</a>  mean, it does not seem that this has been thought through very carefully at all by the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4043.769s">And</a>  I really strongly suspect that this is a revenue generator. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4048.592s">It</a>  is not because of concerns in the neighborhood about spaces being taken up <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4054.675s">by</a>  outsiders coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4056.457s">That</a>  could change a little with the green line, but even if it does, the remedy cannot be worse than the problem which generated it.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4068.006s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4069.748s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4072.57s">Just</a>  one other point that I wanted to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4075.793s">Councilor</a>  Knight, I thought I heard you correctly, but I want to be sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4078.836s">Did</a>  you say that $500,000 of ARPA funding was spent <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4083.928s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4084.448s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4085.309s">Okay,</a>  so we spent half a million dollars to buy parking meters for infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4091.931s">Instead</a>  of fixing roads, we bought parking meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4094.232s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4095.772s">When</a>  people say generate revenue, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4098.193s">But</a>  there's another side of the coin and that's the expense side. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4101.294s">So</a>  the city's currently looking at a shortfall of at least depending on who's math, Councilor Bears, your math had somewhere around 12 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4108.697s">Mayor</a>  says somewhere around 3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4111.438s">She</a>  said, she said eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4113.75s">Excuse</a>  me, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4114.331s">She</a>  said eight, she only wanted to fix three. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4116.052s">Eight,</a>  oh, okay, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4118.534s">I</a>  guess the point is that even if it's a revenue generator, and I'm sure the gentleman behind me might be disappointed what I'm about to say, I'm sorry, but if we're paying more salaries for a problem that doesn't exist versus if the cost is $0 from the city, if we don't enforce parking, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4135.386s">We</a>  just went back to before, no enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4138.869s">We're</a>  unfortunately probably not gonna pay those people working that office.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4144.077s">That's</a>  an expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4148.801s">I</a>  will say this, that when we implemented the parking program initially, what we saw was an increase in the local meals tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4163.127s">which</a>  showed that there was a problem, and that those spots weren't turning over. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4166.429s">And</a>  with the enforcement, those spots did start to turn over. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4169.291s">And</a>  then what we saw was actually enhanced growth and enhanced revenue in our business districts through the local meals tax, because those parking spots were turning over, those restaurants were selling more product, and in turn, we were getting more money.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4181.277s">Okay,</a>  yeah, as long as it's not just a revenue side, but it's actually net revenue minus expenses, if that's the objective. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4190.805s">And</a>  otherwise, if it's generating revenue, but it actually costs more to do the enforcement, even though you're generating revenue, that's not a good solution either. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4198.11s">So</a>  I want to point out there's a difference between revenue and expenses.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4201.873s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4204.715s">Thank</a>  you, President Burrell. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4208.46s">Just</a>  in light of I think it's really helpful to get all these comments out in the open in light of the fact that we have a meeting on this tomorrow with city staff present. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4217.342s">I</a>  just I just wanted to remind folks about that opportunity, and also to, you know, kind of bringing it back to the conversation on, you know where actual authority and. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4229.098s">decision</a>  making power lies and where it doesn't lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4231.481s">You</a>  know, I think it's really, really important that the council be sort of a filter through which we could hear what do people need from parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4238.531s">What</a>  don't people need from parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4240.554s">At</a>  the end of the day, the question of <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4244.029s">you</a>  know, do we have the capacity to think through parking policies, to contemplate parking policies like a commission did two years ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4252.658s">Do</a>  we have the capacity to implement those? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4255.662s">Those</a>  aren't decisions that this body makes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4257.844s">And</a>  I think we have to keep advocating for citywide capacity to not just think through those questions, but then to follow through on the findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4267.308s">you</a>  know, I see that being a really important role of this council, our ability to take in these comments and use that to fuel our advocacy for, you know, a level of city capacity that can both ask the question and then act on the answers that it's given. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4282.156s">And,</a>  you know, I just sort of wanted to end on that note, you know, in terms of my contribution to this conversation, knowing that we'll have a better format for this conversation tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4294.337s">with</a>  some of our parking department representatives here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4297.838s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4298.998s">Mr.</a>  Paris.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4299.739s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4300.079s">And</a>  just to, we actually got something in our packet tonight that the ARPA Medford Square parking meters was $218,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4306.081s">So</a>  that's what, at least that's what the purchase order says. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4310.022s">I</a>  don't know if there's other meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4316.984s">That</a>  may have been the request and that may be, there may be other, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4320.114s">Yeah,</a>  there may be other projects, but yeah, I mean, there's a purchase order that things were purchased, like 218,000 in ARPA has been spent on the parking meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4328.42s">So</a>  I just, you know, maybe there's future expenses coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4332.302s">Just</a>  to Councilor Collins' point, I think it's really right on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4334.944s">It's,</a>  you know, as of right now, as far as I can tell, when we're talking about net revenue for parking, we're actually worse off under this system than we were under the Park Medford system. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4344.831s">Park</a>  Medford said, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4346.649s">world</a>  raise up to like 1.6 you know we'll do up to 1.6 million and then we keep it and then we start giving you portions above that now they use that and I may not have all the numbers in my head exactly right but you know now as far as I can tell we are <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4361.323s">spending</a>  more than we're collecting, at least so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4364.004s">And</a>  it's a new program and it's getting up to year and there's a lot of reasons why that may be true. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4369.545s">But</a>  I think the point is well taken that Councilor Collins made that when we're talking about scope and goals and why are we making the decisions that we're making. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4378.046s">A,</a>  that fundamentally lies with the mayor and B, there was a parking policy committee that was established and made a bunch of recommendations <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4388.252s">Almost</a>  two years ago now, the recommendations came out, and a lot of those recommendations didn't have follow through. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4394.601s">And</a>  instead of having a comprehensive plan for South Medford and the Green Line extension, we have a last minute proposal at the Traffic Commission that's really negatively impacting folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4403.834s">And</a>  instead of having a piece of this report that came to us tonight, it's for tomorrow, is talking about how when the director, and we were talking about being set up to succeed or set up to fail, even when the director came in, who I'm sure is gonna be the person that is here to answer our questions, that the administration is expecting to take the blame. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4424.063s">The</a>  director puts in this report, when I started in October, 2021, I was shown an office and asked what it needed to be a good working space. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4431.446s">To</a>  date, none of the major things have been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4434.487s">So</a>  the office a year ago that she walked into before she was the parking director, when she said, here's what we need to make this a workplace that's going to work for the functioning of this department, for a year, the request that she's made, I assume to the mayor who runs this building, have gone unheeded. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4452.018s">So,</a>  you know, we can point fingers, we can say, oh, it's the, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4459.827s">We</a>  can try to cast blame, but at the end of the day, the buck stops at one person in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4464.549s">There's</a>  one person who manages everyone else in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4467.451s">We</a>  don't have the authority to tell any department what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4469.972s">We</a>  can talk about things and try to hold people accountable and make suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4474.134s">But</a>  that power, as I've now said in a couple meetings, lies with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4478.896s">That's</a>  what our city charter says. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4480.297s">And</a>  unless, I mean, we can Monday morning quarterback

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4541.009s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4542.67s">The</a>  first item mentioned in here, the Marijuana Equity Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4548.413s">That</a>  changes, what I've gathered from it is that it changes the role of the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission with regards to host community agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4558.778s">It</a>  changes our city's or all municipalities' role in terms of certain <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4568.163s">certain</a>  updates when it comes to marijuana establishments, businesses, changes, how some of the more financial aspects as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4579.57s">And</a>  so I don't have a full picture of what exactly those changes look like, but I do think it would be helpful for our council to get a better picture of what those effects might look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4592.178s">And</a>  it's a similar story for the Supreme Judicial Court's decision, which basically we got a recommendation to review our zoning and normal ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4609.436s">with</a>  regards to marijuana and with regards to making sure that the criteria in that court case serves as a basis for an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4625.097s">for</a>  our own legislation, that's a lot of work for us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4629.978s">And</a>  none of us here are legal experts or zoning experts on these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4635.36s">And</a>  so we really do need specific help in order to understand these two big changes to cannabis in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4644.242s">And</a>  we need the specific help to understand if we as a council have particular work that we need to do in response to these changes.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4908.238s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4910.059s">So</a>  the Community Preservation Plan Ordinance or Community Preservation Ordinance was adopted in 2017 before the Community Preservation Committee was appointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4921.967s">And</a>  since then, we've had more experience about how the community preservation program operates. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4928.209s">And</a>  based on that experience, we're recommending some changes, minor changes to the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4934.851s">Three</a>  items in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4936.492s">The</a>  first item is just to eliminate some, a procedure that's because it's unnecessary, because it would actually be preferable for us not to have <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4947.58s">Any</a>  procedure spelled out in our ordinance gives us more flexibility to be able to collaborate with the council and with stakeholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4957.349s">And</a>  the other two are in order to simplify the process for appointing new members. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4963.896s">One</a>  of them takes away a prohibition about members of other boards and committees that aren't the statutory boards and committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4970.992s">serving</a>  on the CPC. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4972.953s">The</a>  reason for that is because we might in the future have an affordable housing trust and might want to have a member of the affordable housing trust sit on the CPC. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4983.159s">And</a>  there may be other boards and committees whose members would be valuable contributors to the CPC. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4989.442s">And</a>  thirdly, we are eliminating some advertising requirements that were written into the ordinance, which have actually complicated our ability <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4998.348s">to</a>  recruit people to serve on the CPC. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5001.85s">So</a>  we'd like to simplify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5004.753s">So</a>  thank you for your consideration.</p>

    <p>[Anita Nagem]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5181.351s">the</a>  MBTA's bus redesign proposal, which is still on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5186.196s">The</a>  revised draft is going to be released according to an article on boston.com by the end of October. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5193.572s">I</a>  don't know if the City Council has sent any letters in, but I would strongly urge the City Council to weigh in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5201.896s">First,</a>  I saw last week that Mayor Rochelle Wu had just contacted the MBTA about the proposal with strong objections to changes on at least three of their routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5212.362s">I've</a>  been in touch with Representative Sean Gargali from West Medford, who represents part of West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5219.366s">He</a>  sent letters to <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5221.927s">the</a>  governor and to Steve Poftak, the head of the MBTA, general manager of the MBTA, urging them to delay a decision on this until after the election so that the new administration can weigh in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5235.835s">He</a>  urged, he mentioned that he is urging any other elected representatives to do the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5244.259s">The</a>  public comment period did end July 31st, but <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5248.087s">Obviously</a>  since the local government is still weighing in, it is not too late and I would really urge the city council to weigh in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5257.811s">Every</a>  bus in Medford would either be rerouted or eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5262.052s">I</a>  know in Hillside specifically, 96 would be rerouted away from most of Hillside, 94 would be rerouted to Burlington and reduced to the lowest frequency and the 80 would be eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5274.541s">It</a>  would reduce service in Hillside and West Medford substantially. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5280.047s">Many</a>  people in that area want access to the red line and Cambridge, not the access that they would be providing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5287.975s">And</a>  I really urge the city council to put in some comments quickly before this final draft is approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5297.463s">is</a>  made public at the end of October. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5300.724s">I</a>  don't know what the procedure will be, if there will be another public comment period or if the board will just vote on it, but please, please give some support. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5309.806s">I</a>  believe we gave you copies of our 1600 signature petition from residents, but input from city government is invaluable.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5322.688s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5323.348s">And</a>  we have sent comments as a body and that we of course <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5326.594s">do</a>  once more and send individually as well.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5329.316s">I</a>  just want to, Mr. Clerk, can we confirm that they've received the comments that we sent them?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5336.1s">I</a>  can reach out to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5336.9s">I</a>  know that I sent that out to them, and I've had several conversations with them since. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5341.263s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5343.565s">If</a>  you'd like me to follow up again, I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5344.845s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Bruno Overstreet]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5351.009s">Hello</a>  and good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5351.65s">My</a>  name is Bruno Overstreet. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5352.611s">I'm</a>  a student at Tufts University in Miller Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5354.633s">I</a>  do not know the exact address, my apologies, but I would like to say thank you so much for letting us and all the other Tufts students here in the back corner attend your City Council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5362.22s">We</a>  are all members of a class at Tufts called Intro to American Politics taught by Professor Deborah Schulkraut. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5367.805s">And</a>  we are here for an assignment, a civic activism essay. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5370.206s">We</a>  were supposed to go out into the local community here in Boston to learn about our local community and engage. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5375.109s">And</a>  we thought that joining a Medford City Council meeting would be an excellent way for us as students, a lot of us not from Boston, myself from Northern California, to get involved in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5383.273s">So</a>  on behalf of all the tough students here, we would like to say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5385.674s">And</a>  thank you so much for all you do for the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5388.893s">Thank</a>  you for coming up, and thanks for coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5390.434s">Sorry,</a>  sometimes we have way more interesting ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5392.515s">Sorry,</a>  this one was a little. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5394.437s">We're</a>  a little subdued tonight.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5396.158s">If</a>  you've been here in June, you could have stayed till 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5399.3s">But</a>  I just want to add two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5400.501s">Thank</a>  you for coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5401.642s">If</a>  we're not letting you attend, it's a public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5403.223s">Anyone</a>  can attend, and please register to vote.</p>

    <p>[Steven South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5409.047s">Good</a>  evening again. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5410.708s">Steven</a>  South, 106 Damon Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5414.505s">secretary</a>  treasurer of Teamsters Local 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5416.665s">I</a>  wanna talk about, you've heard some talk tonight about the state of the city and some of the things that are going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5426.467s">And</a>  I've heard several words on this side and a couple over here about, I heard the word crisis, I heard the word disaster, I heard unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5435.909s">And</a>  I just wanna talk first about <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5440.243s">all</a>  of the vacancies right here in this building, the most top level positions in the city, department heads and assistant department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5449.428s">And</a>  Councilor Knight talked about it briefly, but I wanna give just a little bit more of a description of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5460.314s">Vacant</a>  positions right now, chief assessor, assistant assessor, IT director who was terminated in January, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5469.205s">The</a>  assistant IT director, who's also known as the network administrator, who was terminated last week while he's on workman's comp waiting for surgery. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5478.973s">And</a>  I just want to point out that he was the only Muslim that works in city hall out of the many dozens of employees terminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5488.18s">The</a>  elections coordinator who was terminated a few weeks ago after 30 years with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5494.164s">And</a>  the IT director that I mentioned earlier was, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5498.407s">24</a>  years with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5500.228s">The</a>  assistant finance director who quit to go work for another community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5505.531s">The</a>  co-directors of the Consumer Advisory Commission and another employee in that department all quit at the same exact time. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5514.375s">They</a>  all retired together. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5517.096s">That</a>  department is dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5519.837s">The</a>  assistant procurement officer, the assistant HR director, the building commissioner, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5527.913s">the</a>  city solicitor and the assistant city solicitor, all top level positions within the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5534.739s">And</a>  when Councilor Knight said this isn't happening in the other communities around here, I can verify that we represent all of the surrounding communities and this is only unique to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5546.108s">So</a>  the question becomes why are all those positions vacant? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5549.211s">And</a>  I certainly can tell you the wages and benefits are unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5554.995s">They're</a>  very, very, very low. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5557.096s">I'll</a>  give you an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5558.056s">The</a>  building commissioner, they've had it posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5561.537s">They're</a>  trying to get even internal candidates to take the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5566.418s">But</a>  the inspectors that work under the building commissioner make more than the building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5571.74s">So</a>  how would any of the inspectors who are qualified take that job and take a pay and benefit cut? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5581.404s">Well,</a>  that's a union position now, the building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5588.478s">There's</a>  a serious lack of respect at City Hall, and the employees here live in fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5594.464s">You</a>  see people walked in on a regular basis with two letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5598.507s">It's</a>  quite a tactic. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5601.05s">They</a>  walk in, they sit down, there's the people in front of them, there's two letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5605.354s">One</a>  says, I resign, one says you're terminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5607.836s">And</a>  they say, choose one. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5609.218s">Today's</a>  your last day. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5610.679s">I</a>  can name scores of employees that have walked into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5615.517s">Talking</a>  about the wages, let's talk about this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5620.478s">The</a>  department heads and assistant department heads in this building haven't had a raise in almost three years since January 1 of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5631.781s">All</a>  of the clerical employees in this building and outside this building and other buildings that work for the city that just joined Local 25 yesterday, they haven't had a raise in almost four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5645.11s">January</a>  will be four years since their last wage increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5648.853s">So</a>  when I met with these employees yesterday, I actually, one of them was crying that she can't pay her bills, physically crying, hasn't had a raise in four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5662.365s">The</a>  next question that comes up is with half the department heads and assistant department heads vacant in this building, who's running the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5673.423s">Who's</a>  running the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5675.244s">And</a>  the answer is it's contractors, it's consultants, it's KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5681.889s">These</a>  are all for profit organizations that are running a large portion of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5688.814s">And</a>  I find it to be unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5690.655s">Something's</a>  got to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5694.458s">Many</a>  in and out of City Hall are talking about the city going into state receivership. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5700.612s">And</a>  I've asked that question at negotiations to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5705.576s">They</a>  just sit there and look at me, no one will answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5708.398s">But</a>  I will say this, that if this city is going into receivership, the council deserves to know, the residents deserve to know, the business owners deserve to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5718.865s">And</a>  it shouldn't be something that we read about in the newspaper after it happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5723.088s">If</a>  that's happening, we should know. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5727.308s">And</a>  the last thing that I'll say is that I know that the wages aren't raising up in the city and the benefits aren't raising up and the city's asking all the workers, not to give them what they deserve, but asking them to give concessions, which is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5744.439s">And</a>  the wages are not rising up, but the employees are. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5749.703s">They're</a>  all rising up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5750.683s">They're</a>  all joining unions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5754.124s">on</a>  my hands and feet of who's not in a union in the city anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5758.192s">We've</a>  organized, I believe, five bargaining units just in the last 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5763.77s">It's</a>  because people have had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5766.471s">People</a>  are desperate. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5767.672s">They</a>  can't take it anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5768.972s">Something</a>  has to give. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5770.393s">I</a>  would encourage everybody in this room, in the chamber, respectfully, behind me, on Zoom, to contact the mayor's office and demand that the employees in the city be treated with dignity and respect, and that they receive a living wage and benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5785.92s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5786.8s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5788.521s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5791.875s">I</a>  had a chance to read over what you gave us. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5793.858s">I'm</a>  reading about the building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5796.583s">It</a>  says within the six months, the city has retained the building commissioner to perform bargaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5804.325s">What</a>  is he bargaining for?</p>

    <p>[Steven South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5805.885s">It's</a>  not bargaining, but performing our work. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5808.406s">We</a>  represent the position of the building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5811.927s">But</a>  since it's been vacant, because the pay is so low, I believe the maximum pay is up to $109,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5817.329s">The</a>  employees that work under that position make more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5823.17s">So</a>  no one's going to take that job. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5825.991s">And</a>  the labor charge that we filed is, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5829.607s">Now</a>  the city has has the building commissioner in Arlington coming over here doing some of the work of the building commissioner, but I believe it while while he's still building commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5841.557s">Well,</a>  that's the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5842.778s">But</a>  what they're doing is they're saying, well, we can't pay him. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5847.953s">because</a>  that would be double dipping. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5849.713s">It</a>  would be a violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5851.914s">So</a>  he's volunteering his time, which again, the city right now has many- Who's volunteering his time? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5860.716s">The</a>  commissioner from Arlington, but just so everybody knows here, right now there's many open wage and hour federal lawsuits against the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5872.919s">And</a>  that's just opening the door for another one because it is a violation <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5878.22s">of</a>  state and federal wage and hour laws to have someone volunteer to work for the city in that capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5885.946s">So</a>  it's just opening up the city to yet another lawsuit, but we have a whole bunch of them, so it probably doesn't matter.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5893.031s">So</a>  the town of Arlington has no problem with him working here in Metro while he's working in Arlington?</p>

    <p>[Steven South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5898.154s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5898.594s">I</a>  don't represent the building commissioner in Arlington.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5900.436s">I'm</a>  in this building two to three days a week, and I've never seen anybody in the building commissioner's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5905.559s">I</a>  don't know when this guy works.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5924.563s">Madam</a>  President, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5930.108s">You</a>  know, a little more, whatever it is, three years ago or so, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5936.365s">something</a>  that I noted was we were forming a lot of volunteer committees, a lot of volunteer task forces, a lot of volunteer beautification days, volunteer beautification projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5948.555s">And</a>  I think at the time, I don't remember if it was in council or not, somebody noted that we have a lot of serious problems and it seems like the solution is to get someone to volunteer. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5957.481s">I</a>  did not realize it was actually to the level of we have a volunteer building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5962.385s">I</a>  just can't believe that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5968.357s">I</a>  can't believe that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5969.779s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. So maybe you could explain to us what the role of the building commissioner is in the community and what role the building commissioner plays because it's my understanding that any zoning question <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5981.752s">and</a>  the city goes to the building commission, and the building commission is the one that makes the determination as to how those zoning decisions are made in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5988.337s">And</a>  we all know what a crucial role zoning plays in our ability to generate new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5993.461s">And</a>  when we're sitting here, beating our chest after $49 million of deficit spending over the last three years, and no revenue generation plan, it might make sense for us to prioritize this position, because ultimately the building commissioner is someone that does help generate revenues through permits and fees, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6011.493s">and</a>  through rulings on zoning, as well as oversight of the code enforcement office, which is something that we all have had talks and discussions about in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6020.076s">Thank</a>  you, Mary.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6321.924s">And</a>  I guess all I'm challenging is that...

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6633.373s">So</a>  through the chair then, I don't know, we have maybe 20, 25 boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6642.917s">So</a>  what you're saying then is that some of them inherently, because the statutory <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6649.711s">do</a>  require residency and some of them do not and if that's the case how does one find out which ones do require a residency requirement and then of the ones that do not how could that be who has the authority to change it to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6671.535s">there</a>  is a residency requirement to sit on boards.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6675.218s">As</a>  the authority through a regulatory action to establish the protocols and criteria for which a member of a board of commission under her purview would be fit, residency can be one of those selective criteria that she uses.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6687.788s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6689.969s">Point</a>  of information if I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6693.112s">Another</a>  avenue would be to contact our city solicitor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6696.294s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6699.517s">Our</a>  city solicitor?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6700.337s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6701.721s">When</a>  we get one. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6703.442s">When</a>  we get one.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6705.162s">Who</a>  is the perfect response to that question? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6707.943s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, the other thing is that the charter gives the mayor near unilateral authority over boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6715.185s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, we talk about making decisions or not making decisions, and it seems to be it's another one where there's just not a decision being made. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6723.537s">by</a>  the person who could.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6724.497s">I</a>  guess I'm sorry to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6726.518s">The</a>  reason I'm confused is that she's bouncing it over to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6729.559s">You</a>  guys are bouncing it over to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6731.059s">I'm</a>  confused.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6733.96s">We</a>  don't have appointing authority on that board. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6735.941s">We</a>  don't have removal authority on that board. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6737.361s">So</a>  I can assure you it's her and not us. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6739.682s">Yes,</a>  there is the ability of the council to write an ordinance around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6742.943s">But</a>  if this is something that bothers you and you want done tomorrow, the mayor can do that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6747.884s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6755.64s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6759.149s">All</a>  those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6759.93s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6760.712s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6762.055s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6762.817s">Meeting</a>  is adjourned.</p>
