Vice President Behrs, how did you find them?

22
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:49,639

This was a meeting on our housing production plan, I believe, that is on the agenda tonight.

31
00:01:09,996 --> 00:01:10,596
For a full vote.

32
00:01:11,297 --> 00:01:12,258

2-0, 0-2-0 and 16-604, September 20th, 2022.

36
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,534
We need a whole report to follow.

37
00:01:23,194 --> 00:01:29,039
This was on the food trucks and we reviewed a draft from 2016 and made some suggestions to move forward.

38
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:34,582
And 19-070, September 21st, 2022, committee of the whole report to follow.

All those opposed?

46
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:55,216
Motion passes.

47
00:01:55,236 --> 00:01:57,378
22-505, offered by Councilor Carviello.

48
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:04,047
Be it so resolved, would you like to combine names?

49
00:02:04,147 --> 00:02:04,907
Yes.

50
00:02:04,927 --> 00:02:07,448
22-505 and 22-506, offered by Councilor Carvalho and offered by Rites and Affairs.

51
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:14,991
Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council send its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of former Medford City Councilor Bill Carr on his recent passing.

52
00:02:15,111 --> 00:02:20,353
Bill, along with being a Medford City Councilor, was a teacher and coach for the Medford Public Schools until his retirement.

53
00:02:20,393 --> 00:02:23,834
His presence and dedication to our community will be missed.

54
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:26,458
Councilor Carvio.

55
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:27,559
Thank you, Mr President.

56
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:31,381
Um, again, I think my resolution speaks for itself.

57
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,942
I did admit that Mr Carr was also a veteran.

58
00:02:34,962 --> 00:02:36,083
He served this country.

59
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:41,725
Um, I think, uh, I had Mr Carr in Lincoln Junior High as a teacher.

60
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:43,206
He was a basketball coach.

61
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:49,469
I mean, he's a guy that, uh, him and his family have dedicated themselves to the city of Medford.

62
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:53,491
Um, he was here as a counselor for a bit.

63
00:02:55,062 --> 00:02:59,024
I don't know if anybody remembers what Mr. Carr is saying was during his election.

64
00:03:00,604 --> 00:03:02,525
Nothing changes if nothing changes.

65
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:03,966
And that was his slogan.

66
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:08,187
That's what cut him off way back in those days.

67
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:11,048
But he was a good man and a good family.

68
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:15,190
And his presence in our community.

69
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,332
And as Councilor Scott plays many times, another icon.

70
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,567
has passed away that won't be replaced.

71
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,237
And Madam President, if I could ask if this meeting be held in his honor.

72
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,161
of course, thank you, Councilor Carviello.

73
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:33,122
Vice President Behrs.

74
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:53,567
I will be brief, but Mr. Carr definitely held a towering presence in the community, and I've been more than lucky to serve on boards with his children and also go to Medford Public Schools with his grandchildren, and I will leave it at that.

75
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:54,507
He will certainly be missed.

76
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:55,928
Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

77
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:56,688
Councilor Carviello.

78
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:00,902
Councillor interjecting.

79
00:04:06,102 --> 00:04:06,422
Thank you.

80
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:11,924
I know that when I saw this, I got a phone call from Bill Jr.

81
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:13,764
that Mr. Carr has passed.

82
00:04:13,904 --> 00:04:22,887
And I know how the family had worked to bless him with the wishes that he live and die like he lived.

83
00:04:23,147 --> 00:04:24,748
And he was just an amazing person.

84
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:27,248
He battled.

85
00:04:27,588 --> 00:04:32,410
He taught his family how to live and how to live for their community.

86
00:04:33,846 --> 00:04:50,224
From South Medford where the Carr family started, to West Medford and Hillside coaching Little League, to the classrooms at Medford High School and the guidance counselor office at Medford High, Mr. Carr touched a lot of people's lives in a very positive way.

87
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:55,047
And again, I've been saying this for the years that I've been on the city council.

88
00:04:55,087 --> 00:05:03,252
We're seeing too many Method legends pass on, and not enough people picking up the torch where people like Mr. Carr have left off.

89
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:09,436
What he did do is he did teach his children to give back to the community.

90
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:16,440
And we know both Bill and Doug have given their lives to Medford, and they're always behind the scenes.

91
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,882
You never see them a lot like Mr. Carr.

92
00:05:21,003 --> 00:05:31,509
you know, a true Mustang, a true legend, a BC, a love of Boston College, and a person that would be missed.

93
00:05:31,609 --> 00:05:45,157
I know that tomorrow's his wake and Thursday's his send off, and I'm sure we'll see a lot of grateful people for knowing Mr. Carr and his family, and someone that will be missed.

94
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:47,558
So my condolences to the family, and

95
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:52,500
If you have a minute, read his obituary, and it speaks volumes.

96
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:04,324
And maybe, maybe if a constituent reads that and says, geez, let me pick up just a little bit of what Mr. Carr has done for our community, you can make such impacts.

97
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:05,264
And that's what he's done.

98
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:06,965
So bless him.

99
00:06:07,265 --> 00:06:09,265
And thank you, Madam President.

100
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:10,166
Thank you, Councilor Pelli.

101
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:12,546
Thank you for the discussion from the council.

102
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:13,287
Councilor Knight.

103
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:15,147
Madam President, thank you very much.

104
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:16,988
Bill Carr was a great Mustang.

105
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:33,983
pillar of the community, father and grandfather, teacher, coach, community activist, good elk, a member of Post 45, American Legion, veteran, served his country and this community well, some that I have fond memories of that will sadly be missed.

106
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:43,249
It's all too often that we're up here celebrating people and the achievements and contributions that they make to our community after their passage.

107
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:59,273
And this is one of those instances where I think we should have taken an opportunity to look at the contributions that Mr. Carr had made to this community and maybe had the chance to honour him while he was still with us because he is someone that certainly has made a difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of families in this community.

108
00:06:59,373 --> 00:07:01,375
Thank you Councillor Knight.

109
00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:02,697
Any further discussion from the Council?

110
00:07:04,372 --> 00:07:17,838
Briefly, I didn't have the pleasure of knowing Mr. Carr, but I have worked with and interacted with his sons, and if his family's dedication to the city is any indication, it's truly a great loss for the city, and he will be sorely missed, and I send my condolences to his family.

111
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:23,661
So on the motion of Councilor Carviello and Vice-President Behr, seconded by- Second.

112
00:07:23,681 --> 00:07:24,622
Councilor Sang, all those in favor?

113
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:24,922
Aye.

114
00:07:25,102 --> 00:07:25,502
Opposed?

115
00:07:25,522 --> 00:07:26,082
Motion passes.

116
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:27,283
Please rise for a moment of silence.

117
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:47,926
22-508 offered by Councilor Sang.

118
00:07:47,946 --> 00:07:53,269
Be it resolved that the City Council recognize and celebrate Hispanic American Heritage Month.

119
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:53,989
Councilor Sang.

120
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:55,090
Thank you.

121
00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:02,513
This month, starting from September 15th to October 15th is Hispanic American Heritage Month, which is a

122
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:07,056
a heritage fund that has been recognized for decades.

123
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:27,830
I wanted to take a moment out of our council agenda to thank the members of the Hispanic American community here in Medford for the contributions to our community, to our business, to our livelihoods, and to celebrate their culture and their worth in our city, especially as

124
00:08:29,213 --> 00:08:39,962
as we're seeing at a national level, oftentimes things like this, things like identity and roots have been used as political toys.

125
00:08:40,983 --> 00:08:52,712
I wanna make sure that in Medford, we affirm that Hispanic Americans are welcome, and not only are they welcome, we celebrate their community here.

126
00:08:54,453 --> 00:08:55,194
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

127
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:56,435
Any further discussion?

Be it resolved that the Medford City Council recognize the Jewish High Holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur and wish a happy and healthy new year and an extremely fast two-fold observed.

Councilor Collins.

137
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,771
Thank you, President Morrell.

138
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:19,952
This speaks for itself.

139
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:22,414
Rosh Hashanah began on Sunday night this year.

140
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:25,676
To all my fellow Jews, I just want to say Shanah Tovah to everybody.

141
00:09:25,696 --> 00:09:28,038
Hope the year ahead is a sweet one.

142
00:09:28,398 --> 00:09:28,698
Thank you.

143
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:30,460
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

144
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,340

00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:35,043
On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

Thank you, President Morrell, and thank you very much for reading those URLs.

160
00:10:42,972 --> 00:10:43,713
My apologies.

161
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:49,897
It's my hope that maybe some of the folks tuning into the meeting or reading the agendas might recognize themselves in the

162
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:55,218
eligible groups and follow those links to state support of their work.

163
00:10:55,618 --> 00:10:57,818
Thank you for reading them out loud.

00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:05,620
I just wanted to flag these two opportunities for fellow members of the Medford Arts community, individuals and organizations alike.

165
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,140
The local cultural council program is annual.

166
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,861
It happens every year.

167
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:17,442
It's a wonderful local program wherein our Medford Arts Council members of our own community get to dole out state resources to support

168
00:11:17,982 --> 00:11:24,904
the arts in Medford, for Medford, by Medford artists, and the cultural sector recovery grants is new this year.

169
00:11:24,924 --> 00:11:27,684
It was part of the state's COVID response.

170
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:41,368
That's a way for both individuals and arts organizations to get a little much needed stimulus in that sector to support the work of the creative industry as we come out of the pandemic.

171
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:42,068
Thank you.

172
00:11:42,648 --> 00:11:43,428
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

173
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:44,789
Any further discussion?

174
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:46,149
Vice President Behrs?

175
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:47,768
Thank you, Madam President.

176
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:56,092
I just want to thank Councilor Collins for putting this forward I think we've really seen the benefits of the local grants coming through the Medford Arts Council and we've seen them all across our city.

177
00:11:57,093 --> 00:12:05,437
Just amazing projects that have brightened sides of buildings and different properties, as well as, you know, a supported important

178
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:19,057
I think really just want to drive home the point that you made that arts and culture has been one of the slowest recovering areas of industry coming out of the pandemic.

179
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:32,406
My family has personal involvement in that, and really any way that we can support arts and culture, because we know it's so essential to vibrant economic development, vibrant community and cultural centers here in the community, we should encourage.

180
00:12:32,446 --> 00:12:35,348
So thank you for putting this forward, and I'd second your motion.

181
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:39,097
On the motion, Councilor Collins, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

182
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:39,817
All those in favor?

183
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:39,897
Aye.

184
00:12:40,077 --> 00:12:41,378
All those opposed?

185
00:12:41,398 --> 00:12:42,259
The motion passes.

186
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,881
22-511, offered by Councilor Collins.

187
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:54,767
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council remind residents that the Board of Health is hosting a COVID-19 Bivalent Booster Clinic on Wednesday, September 28th at the Council on Aging.

188
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:56,528
Appointments are available from 3 to 7 p.m.

189
00:12:56,888 --> 00:12:58,810
and walk-ins are available from 3 p.m.

190
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,490
to 4 p.m.

191
00:12:59,650 --> 00:12:59,850
only.

192
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:00,591
Councilor Collins.

193
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:01,988
Thank you, President Morrell.

194
00:13:02,008 --> 00:13:21,100
I just wanted to help signal boost this latest offering from the Board of Health now that the bivalent boosters are available, you know, as we're heading into the fall months, you know, I think it's especially important for everybody to consider getting the new booster now that it's available so we can keep, you know, all of our

195
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:25,043
community members as safe as possible should they choose to make that choice.

196
00:13:25,644 --> 00:13:36,573
And I also want to thank the Board of Health as they continue to roll out these booster clinics as they've been doing all throughout the past two and a half years, you know, really big expansion of what their work is in the community.

197
00:13:36,593 --> 00:13:38,174
It's so important and it's so appreciated.

198
00:13:38,194 --> 00:13:38,895
Thank you.

199
00:13:44,038 --> 00:13:46,379
On the motion of Councillor Collins, seconded by Councillor Seng.

200
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:47,119
All those in favour?

201
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:47,499
Aye.

202
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:48,540
All those opposed?

203
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,440
Motion passes.

204
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,121
22-512 offered by Councillor Collins.

205
00:13:52,601 --> 00:14:06,745
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and thank Medford City staff and Medford Transit riders for their patience and flexibility during the Orange Line shutdown, and in particular recognize the Medford DPW Engineering Division for their hard work in coordinating with the MBTA during this challenging and unprecedented time.

206
00:14:06,865 --> 00:14:07,525
Councillor Collins.

207
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:09,193
Thank you, President Morrell.

208
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:29,283
I had the opportunity to talk with our Director of Traffic and Transportation, Todd Blake, at some point during the past month on a totally unrelated project, and he was telling me about how the MBTA shutdown has just magnified the workload that him and his colleagues have to already take on.

209
00:14:31,324 --> 00:14:34,786
you know, adding a huge layer onto their already very large workload.

210
00:14:35,387 --> 00:14:52,217
Now that the orange line is running again, I hope that they're able to turn more of their attentions onto their already full plates and extend, you know, ask my counselors to join me in extending our gratitude for their hard work during this really turbulent, deeply unprecedented time in our interactions with the MBTA.

211
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:52,737
Thank you.

212
00:14:53,178 --> 00:14:54,038
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

213
00:14:54,218 --> 00:14:54,879
Any further discussion?

214
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,301
On the motion of Councilor Collins, as seconded by Councilor Carviello.

215
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:00,001
All those in favor?

216
00:15:00,622 --> 00:15:01,402
All those opposed?

217
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:02,303
Motion passes.

218
00:15:02,963 --> 00:15:04,324
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

219
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:07,106
22-513 offered by President Morrell and Councilor Sang.

220
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:13,450
Be it resolved that the administration provide an update on work done to address the noise complaints related to monogram foods and overnight operations.

221
00:15:13,571 --> 00:15:19,454
Be it further resolved that the administration provide any findings related to the special permit for extended hours of use for the building.

222
00:15:19,514 --> 00:15:20,075
Councilor Sang.

223
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,831
Thank you, President Morrell.

224
00:15:23,231 --> 00:15:37,807
This is in regards to an issue brought up to us via email and by a constituent last meeting about overnight noise at Monogram Foods affecting quality of life for their neighbors.

225
00:15:38,948 --> 00:15:39,929
I received an email

226
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:54,112
from the administration stating that the refrigerated delivery trucks that have been parked overnight in their lot will now be required to park across the street in the old Crunch Fitness space.

227
00:15:55,173 --> 00:16:00,657
Monogram Foods is posting signs and will monitor the situation and the deliveries will come from

228
00:16:00,957 --> 00:16:02,018
third parties.

229
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:09,165
The deliveries currently come from third parties, so that's a consideration of how they have to manage the situation.

230
00:16:09,926 --> 00:16:15,351
They're also looking into screening some of the rooftop mechanical units, although that has certain costs of money.

231
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:17,333
This situation is

232
00:16:18,114 --> 00:16:22,099
from what I've learned is slightly complex.

233
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,582
I know the city might be doing more research about that.

234
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:31,190
I don't know if you have more news about it, President Morrell, but this is the most recent update that I have received.

235
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:32,245
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

236
00:16:32,465 --> 00:16:34,547
Yeah, I have that same update that the mayor sent around.

237
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:48,314
It is, I do see them referencing the cost of the screening units as a consideration, considering the rather hefty tax breaks the city allowed them, I would hope that they could find the money to pay for such units to protect the neighbors in the area.

238
00:16:48,814 --> 00:16:54,817
I think particularly because as this came before the council, we had multiple meetings of questions and impact on the neighborhood was

239
00:16:55,544 --> 00:16:56,565
was a large one for us.

240
00:16:56,685 --> 00:16:59,808
So I would hope that this is something that is addressed quickly.

241
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:04,732
I know you'll keep on it, I'll keep on it, but you know, promises are good.

242
00:17:04,752 --> 00:17:07,194
So let's see these things put into action, see how far we can go.

243
00:17:07,974 --> 00:17:10,877
So we stop detrimentally impacting the neighbors in that area.

244
00:17:12,138 --> 00:17:17,962
Is there anyone else, any further discussion on the council from this paper or any members of the public who would like to speak on this paper?

245
00:17:17,982 --> 00:17:24,568
Seeing none, so on the motion of councilor saying seconded by

246
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:28,663
Councilor Carviello, all those in favor?

247
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:29,143
Aye.

248
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:30,264
All those opposed?

249
00:17:30,764 --> 00:17:31,404
Motion passes.

250
00:17:34,906 --> 00:17:37,707
Anyone have any issue with me continuing for the resolution I have next?

251
00:17:38,568 --> 00:17:40,429
I'll go ahead.

252
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:47,692
Seeing none, 22-514, offered by President Morrell, be it resolved that the city council meet in committee of the whole to review and propose updates to the city's outdoor dining ordinance.

253
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:53,415
So this was something that was actually raised to me by our city's economic development director, Victor Schrader.

254
00:17:53,827 --> 00:18:00,908
Just something that we could look at now that this was absolutely transformed temporarily in the early years of the pandemic.

255
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:04,009
And I think it's something that we've seen the benefit to the community.

256
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:10,770
So just taking an ordinance that has existed for a number of years, giving it fresh eyes and looking at it in the situation that we find ourselves in today.

257
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:19,132
And just knowing the increased interest for folks to wanna partake in outdoor dining and also the equity and parity issues that lie there as well.

258
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:22,933
So I would just move for approval and to schedule a future committee to hold.

259
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,021
I can't move approval.

260
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:26,682
I'd request someone to do it.

261
00:18:26,702 --> 00:18:28,643
So do you have a comment or?

262
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:29,684
I'll just second.

263
00:18:29,764 --> 00:18:33,006
So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli is seconded by Vice President Behrs.

264
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:33,746
All those in favor?

265
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:34,146
Aye.

266
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:37,428
All those opposed?

267
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:38,529
Motion passes.

268
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:38,569
22-515.

269
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:40,270
Offered by Councilor Carviello.

270
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:51,717
Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council be provided an update on the status of the reopening of the IT department at City Hall, including who is managing that department, at what cost, and whether our system is safe from hackers.

271
00:18:51,837 --> 00:18:52,558
Councilor Carviello.

272
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:06,893
And something I've asked about in the past, and I see, I think, somebody, the last employee we had at that department is no longer there now.

273
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:10,136
So my concern is, who's managing this department for us?

274
00:19:11,537 --> 00:19:17,702
We're a good-sized city, and do we have a private company doing it?

275
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:19,283
There's nobody in there.

276
00:19:20,003 --> 00:19:21,765
And are we safe from hackers?

277
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:23,078
right now.

278
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:29,743
So I don't know what our status is, but I think we need some kind of update on who's running the department.

279
00:19:30,283 --> 00:19:34,726
And if there is an outside company, at what cost is this being done?

280
00:19:34,747 --> 00:19:36,968
Thank you, Councilor Caravella.

281
00:19:37,068 --> 00:19:37,749
Vice Chair Behrs.

282
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:39,670
Thank you, Madam President.

283
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,891
Thank you, Councilor Caravella, for putting this on the agenda.

284
00:19:43,447 --> 00:19:53,157
you know, in addition to what you said, you know, who is implementing the recommendations that came out of the cyber security analysis that we were told was such a dire issue as well.

285
00:19:53,297 --> 00:19:54,759
So, I mean, that goes right to your point.

286
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:58,963
But, you know, we were told we have a serious cyber security problem.

287
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:02,327
And as far as I can tell, there's nobody in that office

288
00:20:03,648 --> 00:20:03,908
at all.

289
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:10,575
The website was down for a few hours earlier this week, which is a persistent problem.

290
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:19,644
Earlier this year, the website was down for days and weeks at a time, which is not good when folks are looking for essential information and services from the city.

291
00:20:19,664 --> 00:20:19,724
And

292
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:35,708
not to drive home a point that I drive home a little too much, maybe, but not only is there no one working in that office, we don't have any sort of idea what the capital plan is to invest in information technology and technology services across the city.

293
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,550
The more that I learn on a weekly and monthly basis about

294
00:20:40,738 --> 00:20:44,741
the fact that we're purchasing an email contact system, but we're buying multiple accounts.

295
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:49,525
So one department may collect contact information and another department may collect contact information.

296
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:55,470
And when they email folks, you know, updates from the city, not everybody on both those lists gets the information.

297
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:01,715
It's just, you know, really basic coordination problems that could go a long way to solving a major problem that we have in the community, which is

298
00:21:02,872 --> 00:21:07,535
community outreach issues and community education issues about initiatives that are going on in the city.

299
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:18,761
We spoke about it recently about outreach on, I think maybe solid waste task force or something else, but the fact that these systems aren't integrated is a huge problem.

300
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:24,645
We don't have an idea or an amount of money of capital that's gonna be invested in this, and now we don't have any staff that are managing it at all.

301
00:21:25,425 --> 00:21:30,268
So I'll leave it there, but thank you for bringing this up, and I hope that we can

302
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:33,588
start doing better.

303
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,573
Any further discussion.

304
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:42,035
I find this very troubling.

305
00:21:43,196 --> 00:21:48,440
So we have an IT department with no IT director or assistant IT director.

306
00:21:50,502 --> 00:21:54,805
We have a law department with no solicitor or assistant city solicitor.

307
00:21:56,707 --> 00:22:01,691
We have an assessor's department, no assessor or assistant city assessor.

308
00:22:03,217 --> 00:22:04,338
We have a building department.

309
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:06,920
There's no building commissioner.

310
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:12,384
We have an elections office.

311
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,725
I'm not sure if we have an elections coordinator or not.

312
00:22:15,026 --> 00:22:20,269
I've heard various mumblings throughout the community that the moment that Ms.

313
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:25,533
Gale was taken from her office, they had somebody filling her shoes with a higher salary.

314
00:22:27,455 --> 00:22:30,417
I'm not sure what's going on in this community, but it sounds like it's falling apart.

315
00:22:33,794 --> 00:22:35,095
nine months without a budget director.

316
00:22:38,297 --> 00:22:41,320
We got to stop the bleeding somewhere, somewhere.

317
00:22:45,203 --> 00:22:49,106
And we're going to have a great conversation about the failures of our parking department.

318
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:56,532
City is in human resource crisis mode right now.

319
00:22:57,893 --> 00:23:00,395
Human resource crisis.

320
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:02,196
I thank the gentleman for putting the resolution on.

321
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:06,348
the agenda this evening to raise awareness of the issues that are going on here in this community.

322
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:09,431
It's sad.

323
00:23:11,093 --> 00:23:11,854
This isn't normal.

324
00:23:14,617 --> 00:23:15,377
This isn't normal.

325
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:16,919
This doesn't happen in other communities.

326
00:23:20,102 --> 00:23:21,283
We used to hold our head up high.

327
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,604
Medford was the city of firsts.

328
00:23:25,107 --> 00:23:27,389
Now we can't even get people to apply for jobs in this community.

329
00:23:29,971 --> 00:23:35,356
The first community to sign up for the school building assistance program to get a 90% reimbursement on our schools.

330
00:23:36,997 --> 00:23:43,564
The first community to get a transit-based smart growth development in this state of Massachusetts mentioned.

331
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:45,585
Where are our firsts?

332
00:23:46,406 --> 00:23:47,407
What are our firsts now?

333
00:23:48,908 --> 00:23:50,009
The council has some firsts.

334
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,572
The first council to pass a recodified zoning ordinance.

335
00:23:58,729 --> 00:23:59,670
I'm at a loss.

336
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:10,877
It's very frustrating to come here week in and week out and make recommendations on how we can improve the way that we deliver the most basic of city services and have it fall on deaf ears.

337
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:15,580
Right now, we have an IT department.

338
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,821
This network could fail tomorrow.

339
00:24:19,883 --> 00:24:26,227
From the sounds of it, as Councilor Beas said, there was a serious problem going on there that had to result in the termination of an employee.

340
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:28,824
That position was never filled.

341
00:24:29,984 --> 00:24:31,265
So were these problems ever remedied?

342
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:33,547
What is going on?

343
00:24:34,367 --> 00:24:35,728
What is going on here in Metcalfe?

344
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:38,550
Thank you, Madam President.

345
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:39,791
Thank you, Councilor Nye.

346
00:24:40,531 --> 00:24:41,772
Any further discussion from the Council?

347
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:45,654
Members of the public who would like to speak on this?

348
00:24:48,376 --> 00:24:52,599
On the motion of Councilor Carviello, as seconded by... Second.

349
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,580
Councilor Scarpelli, all those in favor?

350
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:54,660
Aye.

351
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,161
All those opposed?

352
00:24:56,201 --> 00:24:56,822
Motion passes.

353
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:00,359
22-516 offered by Councillor Carviello.

354
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:07,662
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council have the Medford parking department stop giving tickets for a permit parking until all issues with the addresses are corrected.

355
00:25:07,742 --> 00:25:08,422
Councillor Carviello.

356
00:25:11,402 --> 00:25:12,023
Thank you, Madam President.

357
00:25:12,683 --> 00:25:16,186
I'm tired of getting these phone calls from people about the tickets.

358
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:18,447
I mean, whole streets are getting tagged.

359
00:25:19,288 --> 00:25:28,835
And I know we're having a meeting with them tomorrow, but I find it hard to believe that the old parking method went in there and changed everybody's address.

360
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:30,476
I don't know.

361
00:25:30,516 --> 00:25:32,938
It doesn't sound like something anybody would ever do.

362
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,562
This is something that's got to stop.

363
00:25:37,922 --> 00:25:42,787
I mean, you're giving 40, 50 tickets a night for streets that don't even exist.

364
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:47,271
So the people of Wellington got tagged last week for Fulbright Street.

365
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:49,492
There isn't a house on Fulbright Street in the same method.

366
00:25:50,493 --> 00:25:52,335
There's a car wash there.

367
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:54,056
And we're giving tickets for that.

368
00:25:56,145 --> 00:26:06,948
Members, I'm going to make the motion that all tickets for Premier Parking cease tonight until this issue of the addresses with Premier Parking are addressed.

369
00:26:07,848 --> 00:26:10,729
These people can't get any tickets, they got to appeal, they got to come back and forth.

370
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:13,510
I mean, it's utterly ridiculous.

371
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:19,051
And I know we're talking about it tomorrow night, but this is something I wanted to get out there tonight.

372
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:20,772
Thank you, Councilor Carvell.

373
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,091
Thank you, Madam President.

374
00:26:23,391 --> 00:26:26,733
I've received similar calls.

375
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:38,241
You would think that if it's truly a database problem, which I have no reason to believe it's not a database problem, but even if it's a database problem, then you have an entire street.

376
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:44,425
And you're enforcement, and you go down the street, and every single car you pass pings as being ticketed.

377
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,914
That should raise a red flag, especially if you already know you have a database problem.

378
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:54,500
It should be practice that goes out to the enforcement officers to say, hey, we have some issues.

379
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,464
There's been a couple of streets when we've gone down for permits that all the data was messed up.

380
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:01,427
If you hit 10 cars in a row on a street,

381
00:27:02,393 --> 00:27:18,605
double no hold off come back and we were going to check if it's a database problem I mean there's kind of a simple check here that you could implement where if you have an issue in your database and suddenly you're ticketing 20 cars on the street which you know is abnormal because it's just not

382
00:27:19,713 --> 00:27:21,234
what your normal practice is going to be.

383
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:28,721
That should, you know, raise a red flag, say we're going to hold off, we're going to come back, we're going to make sure the data is right before we permit the street.

384
00:27:29,121 --> 00:27:32,845
The other thing I want to add is that I've also heard problems on the flip side of this issue.

385
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:44,295
There's some areas of the city where residents fought, you know, got the petition signed, went there, got the permit parking on their street, have had enforcement for months or years where

386
00:27:45,423 --> 00:27:57,406
Now, because the coordination didn't happen at the top level, the Medford police can't go out and enforce permit parking because they've never been trained on the license plate parking system.

387
00:27:58,706 --> 00:28:03,047
And so it's not just on the side of people are getting tickets that they shouldn't be getting.

388
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:11,489
There's also streets that are now filling back up that are permit streets with commuters parking their cars, getting out of the car, walking to the train, walking to the bus.

389
00:28:12,543 --> 00:28:21,146
that should be getting tickets and it can't happen because the coordination between the police department and the parking department by the people who supervise both of those departments never happened.

390
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:24,427
So, you know, again, I'm not disputing your resolution.

391
00:28:24,447 --> 00:28:25,927
I'll vote for it.

392
00:28:26,227 --> 00:28:30,349
You know, at this point, as Councilor Nye said, we know they're not listening to us.

393
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:35,250
So, but there's problems on both ends of this.

394
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:40,132
I think there are obviously solutions that can correct both of those problems.

395
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:45,650
At least on the on the issue of the police have been told now we're going to go train the police on the system.

396
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,330
So that's great.

397
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:54,499
But it's again, there's serious coordination problems across all departments of government that are creating really negative outcomes for people who live here.

398
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:56,100
And it's a management issue.

399
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:58,763
Thank you.

400
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:01,950
Thank you, Madam President.

401
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,471
Thank you, Councilor Cabrera for bringing this forward.

402
00:29:05,032 --> 00:29:26,944
If you remember, the reason why years ago, when I was just a young man watching this council on TV, the biggest issues with parking in Medford is that you saw that people were using the streets, the side streets and main streets of Medford to park so they can hop on commuter buses and take parking for residents all day.

403
00:29:27,384 --> 00:29:28,405
And that was the biggest issue.

404
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:37,565
Now it's turned into something that I believe, during the budget hearings, we talked about new growth.

405
00:29:38,286 --> 00:29:47,732
And I believe the majority of the new growth that is projected is coming from traffic and parking, if maybe someone correct me if I'm wrong, but from fines.

406
00:29:47,872 --> 00:29:55,117
And that's a terrible way to run your community, on the backs and the pocketbooks and the wallets of your constituents.

407
00:29:56,192 --> 00:30:09,677
We're seeing major issues with this parking plan, and it seems like, and we'll talk about this tomorrow with the department head, but it seems like this has turned into just a moneymaker for this community, and it's for the wrong reasons.

408
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:13,318
My recommendation is gonna be the same as Councilor Carviello.

409
00:30:14,598 --> 00:30:23,741
I have constituents call me about this issue in Wellington, where the whole street was tagged, and when people came up to fight it, they said, we'll fix it, you just have to bring up your registration.

410
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:36,296
the constituents said to them, well, if you could see it in your computer and everybody on this street has gotten tickets because it says it's another street, why can't you change that?

411
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:41,280
Because we have residents that are elderly, that find it difficult to get their way to city hall.

412
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:50,827
They want them to come up with their registrations, sit in an office that isn't very friendly from what I gather, and ask them to change this because they made a mistake.

413
00:30:52,423 --> 00:31:04,267
I just don't understand the lack of preparation and the lack of transparency shared by this department and the lack of education that they haven't given our constituents.

414
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:14,530
And again, I hate to harp on the communities that do it right, but whenever they implement any sort of change, it's something done 10 times.

415
00:31:16,284 --> 00:31:23,646
It's put out to the community so everybody in the community understands why these plans and these parking enforcement penalties are in place.

416
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:25,087
So they're educated.

417
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:34,289
I saw one of the biggest increases in fees and fines in a community where I work in that would have made you sick in this community.

418
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:43,272
But the way they unveiled it and the way they educated their constituents, explained to them, do you enjoy your streets getting swept twice a week?

419
00:31:44,273 --> 00:31:54,942
Do you enjoy that we don't ask for any money for our school department, that we can give our teachers full benefits, that we can give them high salaries, that we can look at our paraprofessionals and pay $40,000?

420
00:31:55,643 --> 00:31:56,904
Where do you think that's coming from?

421
00:31:57,444 --> 00:32:05,972
It's coming from fees and fines, but it's understood by the constituents saying, well, if I made a mistake, and at least I know where that money's going.

422
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:11,557
In our community, we don't know why we're getting ticketed, who's giving the tickets, do they understand how they're giving tickets,

423
00:32:13,288 --> 00:32:17,611
And then when someone has an issue, no one is actually talking to a person like a human being.

424
00:32:18,011 --> 00:32:26,517
I've had very calm residents come to me and say, Councilor Scott Pelli, I've gone to the office, I've tried to peacefully just ask a question.

425
00:32:26,597 --> 00:32:29,259
I know it wasn't the wrong, but I just wanted to be educated.

426
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:38,445
And the lack of professionalism in that office, where it was smug people, people looking you right in the eye, raising their arms over their heads and yawning in your face.

427
00:32:39,105 --> 00:32:41,207
I mean, this is customer service at its worst.

428
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:50,398
And this is gonna be something that's gonna be shared tomorrow, but I've welcomed all those people that have contacted me, come to this meeting, share your thoughts.

429
00:32:51,478 --> 00:32:59,240
Because I think we need to put a, sometimes you need to stop everything and reassess so we can educate our constituents, educate the staff that's there.

430
00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:07,303
Because from what I gather, I'm looking at complaints through the union that they're not being treated right either.

431
00:33:07,803 --> 00:33:08,323
It's a mess.

432
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:16,659
And it's disheartening that I know that, you know, constantly very somberly put where we are right now.

433
00:33:16,939 --> 00:33:18,840
And this is disheartening.

434
00:33:20,301 --> 00:33:21,141
This is disheartening.

435
00:33:21,161 --> 00:33:28,105
Now I'm glad we can celebrate a road race and I'm glad we can celebrate trick or treating around the square and that's all fine.

436
00:33:28,405 --> 00:33:30,446
And our constituents deserve that.

437
00:33:31,206 --> 00:33:31,887
We deserve it.

438
00:33:32,687 --> 00:33:34,028
Don't get me wrong, we deserve it.

439
00:33:35,078 --> 00:33:36,260
But that's not what runs the city.

440
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,243
Right now, I'm afraid what the next year's budget's gonna be.

441
00:33:39,664 --> 00:33:42,648
We see the financial climate of this country right now.

442
00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:46,233
I'm petrified to see what we... We saw what we went through last year.

443
00:33:47,588 --> 00:33:54,090
And I think we need to reassess starting tomorrow evening with the Parking Enforcement Office and see where this council's going.

444
00:33:54,310 --> 00:34:05,492
I see, and I'll jump ahead and I apologize, Madam President, but I see resolutions that are coming in front of us tonight that changing of ordinance for great people that have done a lot of work for our community.

445
00:34:05,872 --> 00:34:08,073
But out of all due respect, I was one councilor.

446
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:13,014
How can I vote on something tonight where we don't have any guidance from a city solicitor?

447
00:34:13,374 --> 00:34:16,375
We don't have any legal support from anybody in this community.

448
00:34:17,076 --> 00:34:19,073
whether the intentions of anything that's brought to us.

449
00:34:20,087 --> 00:34:20,747
is good or bad.

450
00:34:20,827 --> 00:34:22,088
We can't do anything about it.

451
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:23,569
So this is very frustrating.

452
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:45,122
I apologize, I digress, but it's been a very frustrating last few days, and I hope people show up tomorrow night and share their concerns, because I tell you what, the phone calls and the emails I've gotten, it's not even anything about just people being kind to each other, just showing respect to each other at a desk, and we can't even do that.

453
00:34:45,222 --> 00:34:46,743
So thank you, and thank you.

454
00:34:46,903 --> 00:34:49,165
I support Councilor Caviello's resolution.

455
00:34:49,205 --> 00:34:49,505
Thank you.

456
00:34:49,747 --> 00:34:50,047
Thank you.

457
00:34:50,207 --> 00:34:50,748
Councilor say.

458
00:34:51,788 --> 00:34:52,148
Thank you.

459
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:54,129
Um.

460
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:56,931
I think Councilor Caravello for putting this on the agenda.

461
00:34:57,531 --> 00:35:10,398
Um I've also gotten these calls and as as as Councilor Barrett has put it, it is a bit ridiculous that you go on to a street notice that everything every car was registered to another street in Medford and

462
00:35:10,738 --> 00:35:12,700
It's not stop ticketing.

463
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:16,502
I think it's a logical step, given where we are.

464
00:35:16,662 --> 00:35:21,906
We need to do a real evaluation of the database and evaluation of the problems.

465
00:35:23,127 --> 00:35:31,513
And we, as Councilor Beres has pointed out, we need better coordination with different departments as well to make sure that our enforcement is there.

466
00:35:31,814 --> 00:35:36,917
And enforcement is going to be an especially important issue as Greenline Extension opens up.

467
00:35:37,818 --> 00:36:05,466
scheduled for November, but as we go through the parking commission's report, old report about South Medford parking, as we respond to what will be resident complaints about parking violations in South Medford as those stops open, we need to make sure that our house is in order and we need to make sure that our parking department and our city is ready

468
00:36:05,566 --> 00:36:07,266
to take on those challenges.

469
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:21,650
Another issue that has been brought to me, and I think Councilor Scarpelli touched on it, is the difficulty of rectifying one's own situation, having to drive to City Hall, having to sit in the parking office.

470
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:30,792
I think we need to develop a process, this is my own opinion, where the parking department handles that autonomously and where

471
00:36:31,632 --> 00:36:34,675
it works easier for residents and we put less strain on them.

472
00:36:35,535 --> 00:36:49,206
And we need to be looking at how we do refunds as well and make sure that people aren't unjustly paying for parking tickets that they didn't deserve in the first place, which is potentially, and I'm sure is a problem.

473
00:36:56,302 --> 00:36:58,784
Um, I think what we need to do is stop the bleeding.

474
00:36:59,464 --> 00:37:00,985
And councilor Cabello is absolutely right.

475
00:37:01,025 --> 00:37:11,272
We need to stop issuing tickets for resident permit parking until mentioned or a mentioned parking department or whatever they go by these days can figure it out.

476
00:37:11,873 --> 00:37:17,136
Um, ultimately this is a department that never should have been absorbed by the city.

477
00:37:18,077 --> 00:37:20,599
You don't have the capacity to run a parking department.

478
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,160
We're proving that daily.

479
00:37:23,221 --> 00:37:25,022
We went from having a vendor that wrote us a check.

480
00:37:26,738 --> 00:37:36,345
to a department that's come here before us now for over $800,000 in initial appropriations, and then another $200,000 or $300,000 in supplemental spending.

481
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:39,107
We're still not getting any satisfaction.

482
00:37:40,328 --> 00:37:41,409
What information, Councilor Knight?

483
00:37:42,449 --> 00:37:45,592
And another $500,000 for meters that came out of the ARPA funds.

484
00:37:48,774 --> 00:37:51,696
Now, we talk about reports, and we talk about committees.

485
00:37:51,776 --> 00:37:53,297
Forget the reports, and forget the committees.

486
00:37:53,317 --> 00:37:54,418
It's time to use common sense.

487
00:37:55,577 --> 00:38:02,480
When we talked about taking parking enforcement and doing it in-house, a committee was put together.

488
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,980
That committee came before this body.

489
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:09,802
And we spoke to that committee, and we said, please talk to us about resident parking, resident parking enforcement.

490
00:38:10,743 --> 00:38:11,623
And what did that committee say?

491
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,264
Oh, we're not tasked to discuss that.

492
00:38:16,905 --> 00:38:19,406
But the recommendation was to take the parking in-house.

493
00:38:21,307 --> 00:38:24,608
How can we have a recommendation to do something without a full and complete assessment of what's going on?

494
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:31,528
When I say stop the bleeding, it's not just the tickets that are getting written.

495
00:38:31,808 --> 00:38:33,429
What about non-renewals to the registries?

496
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:35,350
What about non-renewals for your license?

497
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,031
What about non-renewals for your registration?

498
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:43,314
Because of unpaid tickets that were issued unjustly that you can't get a remedy for here in City Hall.

499
00:38:49,456 --> 00:38:52,318
We need to put the residents first in this regard.

500
00:38:52,438 --> 00:38:55,919
That's what the parking program was established for, to put the residents first.

501
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,040
And we're not doing that.

502
00:38:58,268 --> 00:39:06,494
When we looked at, as Councilor Scott Pelley said, the history of parking enforcement in Medford and why this program came to fruition, it was to turn over spots in the business districts.

503
00:39:07,815 --> 00:39:09,676
That's what it was initially proposed for.

504
00:39:11,537 --> 00:39:21,024
It wasn't to go into the neighborhoods, to go down Sylvia Road, a dead end street, and give people tickets when they've been able to police themselves and have no parking complaints for 50 years.

505
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:40,384
It doesn't make sense to me that the Metro parking department is driving down Wellington Road when Wellington Road hasn't complained about a parking issue in 25 years, but the residents of Goldsmith Ave have been going on C-Click fix for the last six months and asking for relief and no avail.

506
00:39:42,365 --> 00:39:43,426
It just doesn't make sense to me.

507
00:39:44,066 --> 00:39:46,028
We have problem areas that are being identified.

508
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:53,074
through these tools and modules that the mayor has touted as being so effective in the delivery of city services.

509
00:39:53,794 --> 00:39:57,197
But then we're not using the data that we're collecting from these modules to make decisions.

510
00:39:57,797 --> 00:40:00,459
There's no data-driven decision-making at all going on in this community.

511
00:40:04,322 --> 00:40:04,963
Thank you, Madam President.

512
00:40:05,423 --> 00:40:06,063
Thank you, Councilor.

513
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:06,844
Thank you, Councilor.

514
00:40:06,864 --> 00:40:08,325
Councilor Scarbelli.

515
00:40:08,385 --> 00:40:10,867
One thing I find problematic today

516
00:40:13,947 --> 00:40:14,747
I don't have it in front of me.

517
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:18,852
Do we have someone from the city administration here representing the city anymore?

518
00:40:18,872 --> 00:40:19,993
Do we have someone?

519
00:40:20,634 --> 00:40:24,938
Is there someone on zoom that just just just to relay these messages to the mayor?

520
00:40:24,978 --> 00:40:26,240
Is it on that note?

521
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:26,880
I know that it's

522
00:40:29,733 --> 00:40:30,634
Hispanic Heritage Month.

523
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,835
It's also today's national no excuse day.

524
00:40:34,356 --> 00:40:36,657
So I hope someone from the administration is on the call.

525
00:40:36,717 --> 00:40:38,078
Madam President, if they can bring that up.

526
00:40:38,138 --> 00:40:39,058
I do not see anyone.

527
00:40:39,138 --> 00:40:44,241
I do know the interim chief of staff is unable to attend council meetings due to just prior just scheduling issues.

528
00:40:46,603 --> 00:40:47,683
So we so okay.

529
00:40:47,703 --> 00:40:55,448
So in essence, right now, we don't have any, any representation to discuss any concerns and issues from our community from from the mayor's office.

530
00:40:56,193 --> 00:40:57,474
I do not see one.

531
00:40:58,154 --> 00:41:00,336
In advance I can invite specific people.

532
00:41:00,656 --> 00:41:07,600
If we can, just because this is our second meeting now after the summer break and we have issues and concerns.

533
00:41:08,185 --> 00:41:17,049
it could be something that could be answered quickly through someone from the mayor's office and not having someone, I know that the chief of staff isn't here, but there should be someone here.

534
00:41:17,089 --> 00:41:22,171
They have a lot of people in that office, if I'm not mistaken, that could represent that office.

535
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:35,937
So I'd actually put that in the form of a motion that if we can, that we request that someone from the city administration staff represents the city hall in our meetings to answer

536
00:41:36,537 --> 00:41:39,459
constituent services concerns or issues in a media basis.

537
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:41,220
So I really appreciate it.

538
00:41:41,621 --> 00:41:49,226
I mean, considering only meet twice a month now, that I think it's important that we have someone here that it's, you know, I don't think we're scary anymore.

539
00:41:49,246 --> 00:41:50,667
I think we've all toned it down.

540
00:41:50,687 --> 00:41:52,168
I don't think we're bullying anybody anymore.

541
00:41:52,608 --> 00:41:53,509
I think we're in a good place.

542
00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:55,390
So if we can do that, Madam President, I appreciate it.

543
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,371
And it's also chocolate milk.

544
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:27,020
today is uh if you look at the it's uh it's a very important day forget about not only hispanic heritage month and it's also we have very it's we went over that this morning that's why i know that director said today's a very important day for chocolate milk believe it or not do you want to make that a beat paper please please that'd be great thank you i'm just sorry a point of information as well on that point um

545
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:31,440
I appreciate President Morrell's deference to say, you know, we can always do better.

546
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,063
I think that's the attitude we should be having in the community.

547
00:42:34,103 --> 00:42:35,284
We could, you know, we could ask.

548
00:42:36,241 --> 00:42:42,023
send it in, you know, we can send it in embossed and engraved and certified mail letter to have someone come to this meeting.

549
00:42:42,584 --> 00:42:50,907
But this leadership team has gone above and beyond when it comes to getting out a monthly schedule, getting it in front of all the department heads, putting out a regular meeting schedule.

550
00:42:51,367 --> 00:42:58,550
You know, I work with the clerk on this and President Morrell on this on a weekly and monthly basis to say, hey,

551
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:02,492
you know, something that we hadn't done before, here's a month's worth.

552
00:43:03,032 --> 00:43:05,533
We're going to get you four weeks notice on some of these meetings.

553
00:43:05,573 --> 00:43:06,854
We're going to try to get out to you.

554
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:18,861
I know Councillor Collins and myself and other chairs of subcommittees have done equal work to get information in front of people, to talk not just to the solicitor, but directly to people at KP Law.

555
00:43:18,881 --> 00:43:24,484
I mean, you know, I just want to be very clear that it's not a lack of effort on our end

556
00:43:25,404 --> 00:43:29,927
as to why we're not seeing people show up here to be part of our deliberations.

557
00:43:30,868 --> 00:43:37,352
And given what we've experienced really since June, and even before that, obviously, but especially since June,

558
00:43:38,757 --> 00:43:40,498
It doesn't seem unintentional.

559
00:43:41,078 --> 00:43:49,782
And I just want to say that, you know, we're not, we haven't stopped any of the things that we do to reach out and invite people to participate in a collaborative way as part of this process.

560
00:43:50,162 --> 00:43:53,043
It's just that when we reach out our hand, no one grabs it.

561
00:43:53,644 --> 00:43:55,765
No one shows up and people don't collaborate.

562
00:43:55,825 --> 00:43:59,646
And sometimes when they do come, they tell us, hey, we can't, we're not, we're not going to collaborate.

563
00:44:00,087 --> 00:44:02,388
That's been some of the most frustrating piece of this for me.

564
00:44:03,288 --> 00:44:09,294
is hearing, well, that's not our charge, or that's not our duty, or, you know, the council's working on too many ordinances.

565
00:44:09,334 --> 00:44:10,875
It used to be only did one ordinance a year.

566
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:15,760
That has been stuck in my head ever since it was said out loud four months ago.

567
00:44:17,141 --> 00:44:19,483
Nothing changes if nothing changes, right?

568
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,405
And we're working on change.

569
00:44:22,065 --> 00:44:24,608
Thank you, Vice President Behrs, and thank you for that reminder of all the work we do.

570
00:44:24,648 --> 00:44:26,169
And then I have Councilor Collins, I'll go back to you.

571
00:44:26,229 --> 00:44:26,750
Councilor Collins.

572
00:44:28,056 --> 00:44:28,997
Thank you, President Morrell.

573
00:44:29,117 --> 00:44:33,200
I don't want to belabor this point because we're going to have the whole meeting devoted to parking tomorrow.

574
00:44:33,281 --> 00:44:46,832
But I just wanted to say in advance of that, you know, I know we've been fielding so many resident complaints about parking, and we've been hearing indeed from the parking department itself about the challenges that they're perceiving and working through.

575
00:44:46,872 --> 00:44:47,393
And I know that

576
00:44:48,464 --> 00:44:53,085
logical thing that anybody does is when there's a problem, you look, where did this come from?

577
00:44:53,365 --> 00:44:53,985
Who's responsible?

578
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:54,845
Whose fault is this?

579
00:44:55,746 --> 00:45:12,589
And I know we're gonna be hearing it directly from the horse's mouth tomorrow, but I just wanna, I feel like we need to lay the foundation for that conversation with, was our parking department, you know, whether it was right or wrong to bring them in house this year when we did, were they set up to succeed or were they set up to fail?

580
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,250
You know, because that decision was made

581
00:45:16,285 --> 00:45:17,465
before anybody got hired.

582
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:21,467
That decision is unattached to anybody currently in that department.

583
00:45:22,107 --> 00:45:26,429
And I'm not saying that the department has done everything perfectly because we all know that's not true.

584
00:45:26,909 --> 00:45:34,832
We've gotten the phone calls about it, but I think it needs to undergird the conversation that we have with the people in that office directly.

585
00:45:34,852 --> 00:45:39,554
The context has to be, what did they know before their work began?

586
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:41,495
What did they know about the scope of their work?

587
00:45:41,515 --> 00:45:44,796
What did they know about the Park Medford that was there before?

588
00:45:46,795 --> 00:45:50,358
Were they given the true and authentic lay of the land?

589
00:45:50,398 --> 00:45:53,260
Were they given the resources that they really needed to succeed?

590
00:45:54,762 --> 00:45:55,902
That's part of the equation too.

591
00:45:56,043 --> 00:45:56,963
I just want to put that out there.

592
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:57,684
Thank you.

593
00:45:57,704 --> 00:45:58,385
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

594
00:45:58,605 --> 00:46:00,346
Councilor Knight, then we'll go to public comment.

595
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:04,710
Madam President, I just, I do want to point out that these failures are really managerial failures.

596
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:12,956
And, you know, when we talk about the human resource problems that we have there in our community and the human resource crisis that's going on here in Medford,

597
00:46:14,428 --> 00:46:24,533
In our packets this evening when we got here, we have charges, additional charges that were brought forward by local 25 who represent our parking enforcement officers.

598
00:46:25,253 --> 00:46:31,136
And it appears to me that the administration's not exactly treating them in the kind of fashion as well.

599
00:46:32,377 --> 00:46:39,300
Tracking devices and cameras, randomly changing our, randomly changing schedules from night to day and day to night.

600
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,081
I mean, imagine having a family and having your schedule randomly changed.

601
00:46:42,161 --> 00:46:43,342
Next week you're working nights, sorry.

602
00:46:46,653 --> 00:46:47,934
I wonder why the program isn't working.

603
00:46:50,296 --> 00:46:53,719
We need to invest in the people that are doing the work in order to make the program successful.

604
00:46:56,621 --> 00:46:57,302
Thank you, Councilor Nay.

605
00:46:57,642 --> 00:46:58,983
Any further discussion from the council?

606
00:46:59,003 --> 00:47:03,327
Discussion from members of the public, please.

607
00:47:03,627 --> 00:47:04,808
Name and address for the record, please.

608
00:47:10,393 --> 00:47:14,657
This is a parking-related issue, not directly related to this enforcement.

609
00:47:15,935 --> 00:47:16,695
it would lead to that.

610
00:47:17,456 --> 00:47:20,337
I wanted to come and speak to you after the last Traffic Commission meeting.

611
00:47:21,317 --> 00:47:33,322
At that meeting, the Traffic Commission was voting on whether to make permit parking or extend permit parking around the new Green Line station all the way to Route 16.

612
00:47:33,943 --> 00:47:39,105
Initially, they were going to make it a quarter mile radius around the station, then it increased a little bit.

613
00:47:39,813 --> 00:47:44,194
Suddenly at the beginning of September, it was going to be all the way to Route 16.

614
00:47:44,694 --> 00:47:45,934
There was very little notice given.

615
00:47:47,374 --> 00:47:57,376
I live on Norton Avenue, which is an extremely small private way, which runs between North Street and Lyman Ave, close to Route 16, close to the Whole Foods.

616
00:47:58,816 --> 00:48:05,978
Our street is, when I say small, whenever I call the DPW about something, they say, oh, Norton Avenue.

617
00:48:09,682 --> 00:48:12,404
There's barely enough room on our street for people to park.

618
00:48:12,444 --> 00:48:13,805
There's no room for sidewalks.

619
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:18,508
Whenever we have visitors, they have to park on either Lyman or North Street.

620
00:48:19,448 --> 00:48:29,074
Whenever anyone has any renovation work done or any kind of big truck needs to come on the street, at least half the residents have to park on either North Street or Lyman Ave.

621
00:48:30,435 --> 00:48:36,819
If there was a lot of snow, like the winter of 2015, or any snow that doesn't melt,

622
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:39,592
some of us have to usually park there.

623
00:48:40,352 --> 00:49:04,821
When I asked the traffic commission about whether, or actually not the traffic commission, the city engineer about whether if they made permit parking in the area that people on Norton Ave would be able to get variances, he sent me a message back saying that the houses that abut North Street would be able to get variance and the rest of us may in italics be able to get one.

624
00:49:08,144 --> 00:49:14,847
The discussion at the meeting initially, the traffic commission meeting was about making permit parking, but having it street by street.

625
00:49:15,727 --> 00:49:21,729
As more and more public comments came in, they started discussing, well, maybe we could make it zone parking.

626
00:49:21,769 --> 00:49:26,551
And it was very vague and clearly it was not thought through very carefully.

627
00:49:28,392 --> 00:49:36,955
Not allowing residents of a street like Norton Avenue to get variances to park if this was all made permit parking would be devastating.

628
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:40,554
It would also be devastating for the residents of Walkland Court.

629
00:49:41,894 --> 00:49:43,234
There is almost no parking there.

630
00:49:43,734 --> 00:49:49,176
I know a number of residents who depend on their vehicles to maintain their independence.

631
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:55,397
Quite a few of them park on either North Street or Auburn, sometimes other streets.

632
00:49:56,477 --> 00:49:58,238
I've been in that area for 35 years.

633
00:49:58,258 --> 00:49:59,718
It has never been an issue.

634
00:50:02,488 --> 00:50:15,154
The way this situation is developing now, I mean, I have extreme concerns about whether this proposal will be implemented to make the entire area permit parking.

635
00:50:15,914 --> 00:50:17,735
It has been tabled for now.

636
00:50:18,395 --> 00:50:25,999
They're gonna wait until the Green Line station opens, but this is not a one size fits all solution.

637
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:30,601
People really need to think about the consequences again,

638
00:50:31,532 --> 00:50:42,497
Norton have residents would either be trapped in their driveways or prevented from getting home if we could not park on adjacent streets as necessary.

639
00:50:43,478 --> 00:50:46,559
And I hope that the council will bring up this issue.

640
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,421
There was no discussion with residents of my area

641
00:50:52,097 --> 00:50:54,758
before this proposal was put before the traffic commission.

642
00:50:55,218 --> 00:51:00,559
I know that a lot of streets have gotten together and gotten petitions together to have the streets made permit parking.

643
00:51:01,439 --> 00:51:02,339
None of that was done.

644
00:51:02,419 --> 00:51:03,359
It was just a vote.

645
00:51:04,259 --> 00:51:07,480
We got a message saying, we're voting on this at the next meeting.

646
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:13,281
I really hope that the council will bring up this issue.

647
00:51:14,621 --> 00:51:17,722
Zone parking is the minimum that they would do.

648
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:30,915
But if it is made zone parking, and they actually do vote on this and it goes through, residents of private ways, residents of places like Walkland Court need to be able to get variances to park.

649
00:51:32,115 --> 00:51:41,899
And there's really no other option for any of us, or the people on my street, people in Walkland Court.

650
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,281
And I really hope that the council will press the Traffic Commission on this

651
00:51:46,705 --> 00:51:48,207
This is going to come up again for a vote.

652
00:51:48,267 --> 00:51:52,751
They're going to discuss it again, November, December, after the Green Line station opens.

653
00:51:54,413 --> 00:51:54,734
Thank you.

654
00:51:55,114 --> 00:51:55,394
Thank you.

655
00:52:01,158 --> 00:52:04,082
Steven South 106 Damon Road, Medford.

656
00:52:05,263 --> 00:52:13,273
Also the secretary treasurer of Teamsters Local 25 and coincidentally, we represent as one of our groups, the parking department.

657
00:52:13,354 --> 00:52:16,397
So I want to deal with facts.

658
00:52:17,158 --> 00:52:17,539
I often

659
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,302
speak to you and give you packets of information because I want you to have the facts.

660
00:52:22,382 --> 00:52:24,382
So I want to give you some of those right now.

661
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:32,666
Number one, that when this part department was created, I think the city put the cart before the horse.

662
00:52:32,966 --> 00:52:42,330
So in January, the city hired a bunch of employees before they even had meters and a plan on how to conduct a parking program within the city.

663
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:48,533
Well, that being said, there was very little, if any, training for a lot of the employees.

664
00:52:49,293 --> 00:52:50,453
There was a high turnover.

665
00:52:50,994 --> 00:52:52,915
Several of the initial employees quit.

666
00:52:52,955 --> 00:52:53,795
They've hired new ones.

667
00:52:54,575 --> 00:52:56,076
Little to no training again.

668
00:52:56,096 --> 00:52:59,238
And if you look at the packet that I gave you,

669
00:53:01,059 --> 00:53:10,268
Councilor Knight was correct that there have been many unfair labor practices charges filed by the union on behalf of the employees.

670
00:53:10,348 --> 00:53:13,732
So I just want you to see the climate that they're working in.

671
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:16,375
So some of the charges are as follows.

672
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:21,285
Their schedules can change from day to day, from day to night.

673
00:53:21,525 --> 00:53:28,408
So if someone calls in sick, they say, Steve, we know your days, but tomorrow you're on nights and the next day you're on days and the next day you're on nights.

674
00:53:28,948 --> 00:53:30,949
They're severely short-staffed right now.

675
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,910
So they're just bouncing people around.

676
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:45,036
We filed another unfair labor practice charge with the state regarding a recent change that were made to their schedules, which as I know it, it's the first in the state

677
00:53:46,396 --> 00:53:53,219
And that's where the city unilaterally changed these workers' work schedule to a six-day schedule.

678
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,140
That's just to get their 40 hours.

679
00:53:55,521 --> 00:54:05,505
They work eight hours Monday, eight hours Tuesday, eight hours Wednesday, eight hours Thursday, four hours on Friday, four hours on Saturday.

680
00:54:05,805 --> 00:54:10,368
So they have six days of work just to get their regular 40-hour shift.

681
00:54:10,388 --> 00:54:11,288
There's no overtime.

682
00:54:12,229 --> 00:54:14,710
And they get one day with their families on Sunday.

683
00:54:16,752 --> 00:54:25,094
They put body cameras, without negotiating with Local 25, they put body cameras on the employees, all the employees in this department.

684
00:54:25,514 --> 00:54:28,115
Did the police even have body cameras in there?

685
00:54:28,255 --> 00:54:39,137
I mean, certainly it's a mandatory subject of collective bargaining, and the city just forgot to talk to us about it, and unilaterally forced these workers to wear body cameras.

686
00:54:40,348 --> 00:54:41,549
The staff in the office.

687
00:54:42,471 --> 00:54:52,342
Again, the city unilaterally put up cameras in the office with audio and video without bargaining with the union.

688
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:58,970
So the employees on the street have cameras and the employees in the office have cameras.

689
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:19,259
The last point that I wanna make, and again, I know it's easy to, you guys are getting a lot of complaints, and I'm sure a lot of them are valid, but it's very easy to blame the low-level rank-and-file employees who, by the way, I talk to on a regular basis.

690
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,281
they're working as directed.

691
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:22,663
So I just want to point that out.

692
00:55:22,703 --> 00:55:29,770
And I know everybody's upset and people in the, in the chamber here are upset and people on zoom are upset and some of you are upset, right?

693
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:43,423
I understand, but these employees, the parking control officers, the repair people, the clerical people, they're working as directed at the direction of the mayor and her administration, HR, chief staff,

694
00:55:44,044 --> 00:55:45,405
they're working as directed.

695
00:55:45,465 --> 00:55:46,725
So I just want to point that out.

696
00:55:47,106 --> 00:55:48,546
The employees are very low paid.

697
00:55:49,087 --> 00:55:53,829
They're lower paid than all the other communities, which we represent several of them.

698
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:56,070
They're very low paid.

699
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:57,491
They have very low benefits.

700
00:55:57,531 --> 00:56:03,134
We're in negotiations now, of course, like all the other units, the city's offering nothing.

701
00:56:04,054 --> 00:56:06,935
And it's a common theme throughout the city.

702
00:56:06,995 --> 00:56:08,956
So respectfully to all of you,

703
00:56:10,257 --> 00:56:25,461
Madam Chairman, counselors, I just want to make sure that everyone sees the complete picture and that the rank and file, the low level people that are just trying to feed their families don't feel the brunt of this when it's managerial decisions that are driving these things.

704
00:56:25,741 --> 00:56:27,162
I thank you for your kind attention.

705
00:56:27,562 --> 00:56:27,882
Thank you.

706
00:56:27,902 --> 00:56:29,842
We do have one person on Zoom.

707
00:56:29,862 --> 00:56:31,363
Would you like to go first, President Bares?

708
00:56:32,303 --> 00:56:33,083
Thank you, Madam President.

709
00:56:33,143 --> 00:56:34,263
And Mr. South, thank you.

710
00:56:35,044 --> 00:56:37,764
I just want to be clear, and I think all of us were on the same page.

711
00:56:40,782 --> 00:56:47,225
should be at the management level, and it's a coordination problem when we're talking about these permits or these database things.

712
00:56:47,705 --> 00:57:03,012
If this has happened one time, why isn't the director or whoever it may be saying, we can't let this happen again, let's train our workers with the sufficient training to recognize this problem and not have it happen again.

713
00:57:03,372 --> 00:57:05,793
So I just wanted to add that to the record.

714
00:57:05,813 --> 00:57:10,655
I think we're all in agreement that there's coordination problems at the top levels that are causing

715
00:57:10,735 --> 00:57:11,375
serious issues.

716
00:57:12,776 --> 00:57:17,878
Going to G to Stefano on Zoom and then we'll come back to you Mr. Mayor.

717
00:57:17,898 --> 00:57:20,379
G to Stefano, name and address for the record please.

718
00:57:20,839 --> 00:57:22,419
I just asked you to unmute.

719
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,921
31 Goldsmith Ave, Method Mass.

720
00:57:27,061 --> 00:57:33,884
And I sent out an email to the crew of you and I appreciate the replies I got back.

721
00:57:34,664 --> 00:57:40,186
And it's interesting, today I was at the parking department and I renewed my permits.

722
00:57:41,673 --> 00:57:45,797
and there's this thing that's called a parking permit portal.

723
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:58,567
I got it up in front of me and it says from 6-28-2016 to 9-29-2022 that I lived on Granville Ave.

724
00:57:59,188 --> 00:58:00,949
I have never lived on Granville Ave.

725
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:08,415
So now I understand what part of the problems are is yeah okay it truly is a database problem and maybe that's why we're not getting tickets.

726
00:58:09,817 --> 00:58:10,017
But

727
00:58:10,593 --> 00:58:15,295
The police department, if they run your license plate, they should be able to tell what street you're on.

728
00:58:15,775 --> 00:58:24,179
So I understand Councilor Caviello not wanting to give tickets out for permit parking, and I'll accept that.

729
00:58:24,419 --> 00:58:40,005
But if a resident calls the police department non-emergency number, because vehicles are parked in front of your house 36 hours straight, I think the police should still be able to give out the tickets.

730
00:58:41,055 --> 00:58:42,496
until this problem is fixed.

731
00:58:44,176 --> 00:58:44,556
That's it.

732
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:47,137
Thank you.

733
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:49,338
Could you actually repeat your name and address for the record, please?

734
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:50,218
We just couldn't hear it.

735
00:58:50,718 --> 00:58:57,300
Gary DeStefano, D-E-S-T-E-F-A-N-O, 31 Goldsmith Ave.

736
00:58:58,381 --> 00:58:58,701
Thank you.

737
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,266
and address for the record, please.

738
00:59:07,286 --> 00:59:08,928
State Merit 373 Riverside Ave in Medford.

739
00:59:09,449 --> 00:59:10,791
I live on a small, narrow street.

740
00:59:12,093 --> 00:59:12,693
Riverside Ave.

741
00:59:13,955 --> 00:59:14,816
It's not a side street.

742
00:59:15,998 --> 00:59:19,303
Can you park on Riverside Ave if you're not in a driveway?

743
00:59:21,526 --> 00:59:21,987
The answer is no.

744
00:59:23,757 --> 00:59:28,618
So I think some, I appreciate what some of the counselors have said tonight.

745
00:59:28,638 --> 00:59:30,398
I was watching this on TV.

746
00:59:30,438 --> 00:59:32,939
I had to come down because my kid didn't want to watch this on TV.

747
00:59:32,999 --> 00:59:34,219
He'd rather watch Paw Patrol.

748
00:59:35,999 --> 00:59:36,579
I don't blame him.

749
00:59:36,779 --> 00:59:39,160
I'm sure some of all of us would too.

750
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:53,162
I think that there's a lot of, I'll call them corner cases that maybe where some of these blanket policies don't address, you know, if you live on Riverside Ave and you're having work done in your house and you can't pull into your driveway,

751
00:59:53,771 --> 01:00:01,634
and you don't have a permit and you come down to the parking office and they say, no, you can't have a permit to park on this side street.

752
01:00:02,274 --> 01:00:02,514
Really?

753
01:00:02,534 --> 01:00:04,055
No, because you don't live there.

754
01:00:04,875 --> 01:00:05,335
No, I don't.

755
01:00:05,395 --> 01:00:14,999
But if I actually want to go to work so I can pay my mortgage, pay my taxes, pay the salaries of the fine people working in that office, what am I supposed to do?

756
01:00:16,499 --> 01:00:22,982
So I think a lot of care and consideration needs to be taken before some blanket policies are put out.

757
01:00:24,126 --> 01:00:32,488
I really appreciate Councilor Knight, something that you brought up, which was, you know, what is the purpose of having parking?

758
01:00:32,548 --> 01:00:33,209
What's the scope?

759
01:00:34,049 --> 01:00:36,109
Is the intent to make money for the city?

760
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:47,933
Or is it instead to keep people from say parking on Governor's Ave and kind of abusing the parking and preventing other people from coming into the city and shopping?

761
01:00:50,663 --> 01:00:52,705
It feels like the scope has been lost.

762
01:00:53,165 --> 01:00:55,907
If you wanna tax your citizens, tax it.

763
01:00:57,248 --> 01:01:02,692
If you're gonna have people pay, yeah.

764
01:01:03,032 --> 01:01:04,453
But at least come out and say it.

765
01:01:06,335 --> 01:01:07,716
But at least come out and say it.

766
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:19,725
Because if you're having people pay to come shop and spend money in the city of Medford, and most of those people are your residents, then that's in effect a tax.

767
01:01:21,575 --> 01:01:32,185
If it's to keep people from say outside the city, you know, from parking and abusing and using the commuter access that we have, that's a different story.

768
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:34,107
And there's different ways to address that.

769
01:01:34,387 --> 01:01:38,011
So the city of Arlington, town of Arlington, I think it's a town.

770
01:01:38,331 --> 01:01:38,591
Okay.

771
01:01:40,493 --> 01:01:43,636
Do they have a parking department enforcement and stickers?

772
01:01:43,977 --> 01:01:46,299
When I lived in Arlington, I didn't have a sticker and I was a resident.

773
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:58,348
I could park on the side and all I had to do is like if I had an extenuating circumstances, you call Arlington PD and say, hi, I'd like to park my car on the street because they have no on street parking for the most part, right?

774
01:01:58,388 --> 01:02:04,673
They have a, the process is communication and otherwise, okay, we know that plate number.

775
01:02:05,253 --> 01:02:07,595
We're not going to ticket it.

776
01:02:07,675 --> 01:02:09,357
It works pretty good as far as I know.

777
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:15,762
City of Cambridge, you can have a parking permit, you get a sticker and that sticker is, you know, it's a permanent resident sticker.

778
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:17,606
and you can park anywhere in the city.

779
01:02:18,847 --> 01:02:21,550
Councilor Scarpelli, how does it work in Sutton-Merville where you work?

780
01:02:22,311 --> 01:02:22,851
Is it similar?

781
01:02:23,251 --> 01:02:24,653
It's expensive, but it's pretty well.

782
01:02:24,673 --> 01:02:35,502
I mean, they run their program, if you have a parking sticker, I believe it's increased now to $180 per car, but it's citywide and it's run pretty well.

783
01:02:37,281 --> 01:02:43,284
I mean, there's a lot of different ideas in here, and I think we need to find something that fits for Medford, but let's keep in mind the scope.

784
01:02:43,324 --> 01:02:46,225
If the scope is to raise revenue for the city, that's one thing.

785
01:02:46,825 --> 01:02:57,789
If the objective is different and it's to keep people from abusing streets and preventing people from coming outside the city to spend money in our city, which is, I think, what everyone wants, that's a whole different objective.

786
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:04,572
So I appreciate y'all maybe keeping that in mind as we go forward and maybe trying to refocus the scope.

787
01:03:05,213 --> 01:03:05,473
Thank you.

788
01:03:07,037 --> 01:03:08,097
Councilor Carvio.

789
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,118
Thank you, Madam President.

790
01:03:09,558 --> 01:03:14,480
I think I'm the only councilor that was here when the other parking program was started.

791
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:27,506
And the scope was, as Councilor Scott Feldman I think said, was to stop the people from parking in the business areas and taking train going to Boston and taking the bus and doing all that.

792
01:03:27,886 --> 01:03:28,286
And it worked.

793
01:03:28,886 --> 01:03:35,509
And it did work and it did what its job was to open up spots in the business community.

794
01:03:36,619 --> 01:03:44,744
But what they didn't do was they weren't going into the neighborhoods and tagging people for these little tiki tac things.

795
01:03:45,764 --> 01:03:49,726
And I think that's where we've gone astray.

796
01:03:51,847 --> 01:03:55,790
And I can't speak for my other counselors, I've only gotten

797
01:03:57,513 --> 01:04:04,901
two calls from businesses complaining about tagging in the business areas, where when Park Method first came in, the phone rang off the hook.

798
01:04:05,321 --> 01:04:07,904
But, oh, you know, you're tagging my customers and everything.

799
01:04:08,825 --> 01:04:11,748
But I say it's changed now.

800
01:04:11,788 --> 01:04:18,115
The only calls I got, I got a call from the Haines Square community, the business group that come down there, because they

801
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:25,182
People were pulling up at the 30-minute signs, and the minute they pulled up, they were getting a ticket.

802
01:04:25,402 --> 01:04:29,986
And I actually videoed the guy one day, and I asked him, I says, why are you giving this person a ticket?

803
01:04:30,346 --> 01:04:31,186
She was here two minutes.

804
01:04:31,847 --> 01:04:34,829
Those are fake signs up there.

805
01:04:34,849 --> 01:04:37,471
Because as I say, it had been going on for weeks at a time.

806
01:04:38,271 --> 01:04:40,413
And I did bring that to the mayor.

807
01:04:41,093 --> 01:04:44,115
I don't know where it's going, but the calls from Haines Square were stopped.

808
01:04:44,135 --> 01:04:47,818
But as I say, all the calls we're getting now are from the neighborhoods.

809
01:04:49,205 --> 01:04:51,947
No more calls from the business community.

810
01:04:52,047 --> 01:04:57,690
And I say, I think we've lost our way on what we're trying to accomplish on this parking program now.

811
01:04:59,291 --> 01:05:00,292
Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

812
01:05:01,573 --> 01:05:04,174
Going to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.

813
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:06,055
Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record, please.

814
01:05:07,156 --> 01:05:10,178
Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street Method Mass.

815
01:05:14,233 --> 01:05:37,426
My gut feeling says we do have a major problem with the parking department um, I went through it firsthand to get my registration and new license renewed And a very very unfunny thing happened to me on the way to the forum the parking forum um Bottom line is I have too much information.

816
01:05:37,746 --> 01:05:39,047
You don't want to hear it all.

817
01:05:39,507 --> 01:05:41,228
However, it is my understanding

818
01:05:42,273 --> 01:05:51,855
that the problem lies supposedly with Park Method, the previous bounty hunter, as Penta would say.

819
01:05:52,655 --> 01:05:55,735
I don't know if that's true, but we're in a big mess.

820
01:05:56,436 --> 01:06:01,616
I guess Councilor X, what was his name?

821
01:06:01,636 --> 01:06:09,958
Mr. Caviello would know, but he used to say, what we have here is a lack of proper communication.

822
01:06:10,656 --> 01:06:12,916
I don't know what's going on, but it is terrible.

823
01:06:13,196 --> 01:06:13,617
Good night.

824
01:06:15,277 --> 01:06:16,337
Thank you, Mr. Mastigati.

825
01:06:19,598 --> 01:06:21,138
Anita Nagum, 9 Norton AF.

826
01:06:21,598 --> 01:06:23,198
There's just one more thing I would like to add.

827
01:06:23,898 --> 01:06:25,459
The previous speaker touched on it.

828
01:06:26,259 --> 01:06:33,100
The permits that they are considering in the area of the Green Line station would be in effect 24 hours a day, six days a week.

829
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:39,941
If the intent is to prevent people from parking and taking the T in, it would seem that

830
01:06:40,495 --> 01:06:43,756
maybe permit parking from eight to five would be sufficient.

831
01:06:44,796 --> 01:06:52,218
If the intent seems to be to raise revenue, by all means put it in 24 hours a day, six days a week.

832
01:06:53,078 --> 01:07:00,800
I'd like to point out to you that there are a lot of rental apartments in Hillside where tough students live.

833
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,520
They move in and out frequently.

834
01:07:04,515 --> 01:07:15,983
any of them moving in, if this were implemented 24 hours a day, six days a week, would almost certainly be in violation as soon as they try to move in or out of their apartments.

835
01:07:16,664 --> 01:07:22,768
I mean, it does not seem that this has been thought through very carefully at all by the traffic commission.

836
01:07:23,769 --> 01:07:28,492
And I really strongly suspect that this is a revenue generator.

837
01:07:28,592 --> 01:07:33,616
It is not because of concerns in the neighborhood about spaces being taken up

838
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:35,916
by outsiders coming in.

839
01:07:36,457 --> 01:07:46,986
That could change a little with the green line, but even if it does, the remedy cannot be worse than the problem which generated it.

840
01:07:48,006 --> 01:07:48,347
Thank you.

841
01:07:49,748 --> 01:07:50,509
Any further discussion?

842
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:54,732
Just one other point that I wanted to ask.

843
01:07:55,793 --> 01:07:58,495
Councilor Knight, I thought I heard you correctly, but I want to be sure.

844
01:07:58,836 --> 01:08:00,897
Did you say that $500,000 of ARPA funding was spent

845
01:08:03,928 --> 01:08:04,348
I'm sorry.

846
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:04,788
I'm sorry.

847
01:08:05,309 --> 01:08:11,251
Okay, so we spent half a million dollars to buy parking meters for infrastructure.

848
01:08:11,931 --> 01:08:13,871
Instead of fixing roads, we bought parking meters.

849
01:08:14,232 --> 01:08:14,452
Okay.

850
01:08:15,772 --> 01:08:17,773
When people say generate revenue, that's great.

851
01:08:18,193 --> 01:08:20,334
But there's another side of the coin and that's the expense side.

852
01:08:21,294 --> 01:08:28,076
So the city's currently looking at a shortfall of at least depending on who's math, Councilor Behrs, your math had somewhere around 12 million.

853
01:08:28,697 --> 01:08:30,177
Mayor says somewhere around 3 million.

854
01:08:31,438 --> 01:08:32,258
She said, she said eight.

855
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:34,310
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

856
01:08:34,331 --> 01:08:35,872
She said eight, she only wanted to fix three.

857
01:08:36,052 --> 01:08:37,533
Eight, oh, okay, okay.

858
01:08:38,534 --> 01:08:55,366
I guess the point is that even if it's a revenue generator, and I'm sure the gentleman behind me might be disappointed what I'm about to say, I'm sorry, but if we're paying more salaries for a problem that doesn't exist versus if the cost is $0 from the city, if we don't enforce parking, right?

859
01:08:55,386 --> 01:08:58,168
We just went back to before, no enforcement.

860
01:08:58,869 --> 01:09:01,691
We're unfortunately probably not gonna pay those people working that office.

861
01:09:04,077 --> 01:09:08,701
That's an expense.

862
01:09:08,801 --> 01:09:16,628
I will say this, that when we implemented the parking program initially, what we saw was an increase in the local meals tax.

863
01:09:23,127 --> 01:09:26,369
which showed that there was a problem, and that those spots weren't turning over.

864
01:09:26,429 --> 01:09:28,950
And with the enforcement, those spots did start to turn over.

865
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:40,777
And then what we saw was actually enhanced growth and enhanced revenue in our business districts through the local meals tax, because those parking spots were turning over, those restaurants were selling more product, and in turn, we were getting more money.

866
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:49,882
Okay, yeah, as long as it's not just a revenue side, but it's actually net revenue minus expenses, if that's the objective.

867
01:09:50,805 --> 01:09:57,470
And otherwise, if it's generating revenue, but it actually costs more to do the enforcement, even though you're generating revenue, that's not a good solution either.

868
01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:00,492
So I want to point out there's a difference between revenue and expenses.

869
01:10:01,873 --> 01:10:02,534
Thank you.

870
01:10:04,715 --> 01:10:05,636
Thank you, President Burrell.

871
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:15,882
Just in light of I think it's really helpful to get all these comments out in the open in light of the fact that we have a meeting on this tomorrow with city staff present.

872
01:10:17,342 --> 01:10:27,265
I just I just wanted to remind folks about that opportunity, and also to, you know, kind of bringing it back to the conversation on, you know where actual authority and.

873
01:10:29,098 --> 01:10:31,461
decision making power lies and where it doesn't lie.

874
01:10:31,481 --> 01:10:38,491
You know, I think it's really, really important that the council be sort of a filter through which we could hear what do people need from parking?

875
01:10:38,531 --> 01:10:40,014
What don't people need from parking?

876
01:10:40,554 --> 01:10:42,677
At the end of the day, the question of

877
01:10:44,029 --> 01:10:52,238
you know, do we have the capacity to think through parking policies, to contemplate parking policies like a commission did two years ago?

878
01:10:52,658 --> 01:10:54,540
Do we have the capacity to implement those?

879
01:10:55,662 --> 01:10:57,283
Those aren't decisions that this body makes.

880
01:10:57,844 --> 01:11:05,933
And I think we have to keep advocating for citywide capacity to not just think through those questions, but then to follow through on the findings.

881
01:11:07,308 --> 01:11:22,136
you know, I see that being a really important role of this council, our ability to take in these comments and use that to fuel our advocacy for, you know, a level of city capacity that can both ask the question and then act on the answers that it's given.

882
01:11:22,156 --> 01:11:33,882
And, you know, I just sort of wanted to end on that note, you know, in terms of my contribution to this conversation, knowing that we'll have a better format for this conversation tomorrow.

883
01:11:34,337 --> 01:11:37,198
with some of our parking department representatives here as well.

884
01:11:37,838 --> 01:11:38,938
Thank you.

885
01:11:38,998 --> 01:11:39,379
Mr. Paris.

886
01:11:39,739 --> 01:11:40,039
Thank you.

887
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:45,681
And just to, we actually got something in our packet tonight that the ARPA Medford Square parking meters was $218,000.

888
01:11:46,081 --> 01:11:50,002
So that's what, at least that's what the purchase order says.

889
01:11:50,022 --> 01:11:56,924
I don't know if there's other meters.

890
01:11:56,984 --> 01:11:58,905
That may have been the request and that may be, there may be other,

891
01:12:00,114 --> 01:12:08,400
Yeah, there may be other projects, but yeah, I mean, there's a purchase order that things were purchased, like 218,000 in ARPA has been spent on the parking meter.

892
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:10,561
So I just, you know, maybe there's future expenses coming.

893
01:12:12,302 --> 01:12:14,884
Just to Councilor Collins' point, I think it's really right on.

894
01:12:14,944 --> 01:12:24,771
It's, you know, as of right now, as far as I can tell, when we're talking about net revenue for parking, we're actually worse off under this system than we were under the Park Medford system.

895
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,732
Park Medford said,

896
01:12:26,649 --> 01:12:40,259
world raise up to like 1.6 you know we'll do up to 1.6 million and then we keep it and then we start giving you portions above that now they use that and I may not have all the numbers in my head exactly right but you know now as far as I can tell we are

897
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:43,964
spending more than we're collecting, at least so far.

898
01:12:44,004 --> 01:12:48,764
And it's a new program and it's getting up to year and there's a lot of reasons why that may be true.

899
01:12:49,545 --> 01:12:56,726
But I think the point is well taken that Councilor Collins made that when we're talking about scope and goals and why are we making the decisions that we're making.

900
01:12:58,046 --> 01:13:07,068
A, that fundamentally lies with the mayor and B, there was a parking policy committee that was established and made a bunch of recommendations

901
01:13:08,252 --> 01:13:13,800
Almost two years ago now, the recommendations came out, and a lot of those recommendations didn't have follow through.

902
01:13:14,601 --> 01:13:23,093
And instead of having a comprehensive plan for South Medford and the Green Line extension, we have a last minute proposal at the Traffic Commission that's really negatively impacting folks.

903
01:13:23,834 --> 01:13:43,042
And instead of having a piece of this report that came to us tonight, it's for tomorrow, is talking about how when the director, and we were talking about being set up to succeed or set up to fail, even when the director came in, who I'm sure is gonna be the person that is here to answer our questions, that the administration is expecting to take the blame.

904
01:13:44,063 --> 01:13:51,386
The director puts in this report, when I started in October, 2021, I was shown an office and asked what it needed to be a good working space.

905
01:13:51,446 --> 01:13:53,307
To date, none of the major things have been done.

906
01:13:54,487 --> 01:14:11,858
So the office a year ago that she walked into before she was the parking director, when she said, here's what we need to make this a workplace that's going to work for the functioning of this department, for a year, the request that she's made, I assume to the mayor who runs this building, have gone unheeded.

907
01:14:12,018 --> 01:14:18,422
So, you know, we can point fingers, we can say, oh, it's the, you know,

908
01:14:19,827 --> 01:14:24,129
We can try to cast blame, but at the end of the day, the buck stops at one person in the city.

909
01:14:24,549 --> 01:14:26,810
There's one person who manages everyone else in the city.

910
01:14:27,451 --> 01:14:29,912
We don't have the authority to tell any department what to do.

911
01:14:29,972 --> 01:14:33,273
We can talk about things and try to hold people accountable and make suggestions.

912
01:14:34,134 --> 01:14:38,856
But that power, as I've now said in a couple meetings, lies with the mayor.

913
01:14:38,896 --> 01:14:40,197
That's what our city charter says.

914
01:14:40,297 --> 01:14:48,321
And unless, I mean, we can Monday morning quarterback anything, but that's where the decision making happened that brought us to this point.

915
01:14:48,741 --> 01:14:49,041
Thank you.

916
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:51,170
Any further discussion?

917
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:57,373
So we do have a B paper before us from Councilor Scarapelli, who I can see in the hallway.

918
01:14:59,473 --> 01:15:06,236
So Councilor Scarapelli had the B paper to ask that the administration send a representative to our regular meetings, every regular meeting.

919
01:15:06,696 --> 01:15:07,857
Seconded by Councilor Collins.

920
01:15:08,597 --> 01:15:09,437
All those in favor?

921
01:15:10,157 --> 01:15:10,998
All those opposed?

922
01:15:11,558 --> 01:15:12,358
Motion passes.

923
01:15:12,558 --> 01:15:15,760
And on the main paper from Councilor Carviello is seconded by?

924
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,922
have ices and bears all those in favor.

925
01:15:19,602 --> 01:15:40,462
All those opposed motion passes to do dash 517 offered by Councilor saying the result of the city administration update the City Council on how chapter 180 of the acts of 2022 and act relative to equity in the cannabis industry in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's decision in the Haven Center Inc versus town of born might affect Medford Councilor saying.

926
01:15:41,009 --> 01:15:41,990
Thank you, Madam President.

927
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:47,412
The first item mentioned in here, the Marijuana Equity Act.

928
01:15:48,413 --> 01:15:58,318
That changes, what I've gathered from it is that it changes the role of the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission with regards to host community agreements.

929
01:15:58,778 --> 01:16:07,223
It changes our city's or all municipalities' role in terms of certain

930
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:19,090
certain updates when it comes to marijuana establishments, businesses, changes, how some of the more financial aspects as well.

931
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:31,618
And so I don't have a full picture of what exactly those changes look like, but I do think it would be helpful for our council to get a better picture of what those effects might look like.

932
01:16:32,178 --> 01:16:47,576
And it's a similar story for the Supreme Judicial Court's decision, which basically we got a recommendation to review our zoning and normal ordinances.

933
01:16:49,436 --> 01:17:03,406
with regards to marijuana and with regards to making sure that the criteria in that court case serves as a basis for an update.

934
01:17:05,097 --> 01:17:09,198
for our own legislation, that's a lot of work for us to do.

935
01:17:09,978 --> 01:17:14,820
And none of us here are legal experts or zoning experts on these issues.

936
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:23,642
And so we really do need specific help in order to understand these two big changes to cannabis in Massachusetts.

937
01:17:24,242 --> 01:17:31,624
And we need the specific help to understand if we as a council have particular work that we need to do in response to these changes.

938
01:17:31,644 --> 01:17:33,205
Thank you, Councilor Svang.

939
01:17:33,265 --> 01:17:33,965
Any further discussion?

940
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:37,699
on Councilor Collins.

941
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:39,399
Thank you, President Rural.

942
01:17:39,419 --> 01:17:42,321
I just wanted to say, I think this is a prudent and proactive measure.

943
01:17:42,341 --> 01:17:45,222
I thank Councilor Sang for putting it forward.

944
01:17:48,003 --> 01:17:48,464
Discussion.

945
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:53,586
So on the motion of Councilor Sang, seconded by Councilor, Vice President Behrs.

946
01:17:54,787 --> 01:17:55,527
All those in favor?

947
01:17:56,447 --> 01:17:57,388
All those opposed?

948
01:17:57,988 --> 01:17:58,648
Motion passes.

949
01:17:59,869 --> 01:18:01,790
Petitions, presentations and similar papers.

950
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:06,683
Communications from the Mayor, City Officers and employees.

951
01:18:06,703 --> 01:18:11,287
22-507 be electronic delivery to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding food truck permitting.

952
01:18:11,828 --> 01:18:20,075
Dear President Morrell and members of the City Council, on behalf of the below entity, I respectfully submit to the Medford City Council the following request for a food truck permit in the City of Medford.

953
01:18:20,155 --> 01:18:24,819
In addition to City Council approval, vendors are required to adhere to the Health Department food safety requirements.

954
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:40,463
Bonnie food truck dates and time Sunday, October 16th, 2022 from 11am to 4pm location, Brooks Elementary School, Medford, Massachusetts event, Brooks Elementary PTO sponsored fall festival about the event on Sunday, October 16, 2022 from 11am to 4pm.

955
01:18:40,503 --> 01:18:45,765
We will be hosting a fall festival fundraiser that will raise money and provide a memorable day for our community.

956
01:18:45,865 --> 01:18:46,925
Additionally, we will showcase

957
01:18:47,945 --> 01:18:50,246
companies and organizations who are sponsoring our efforts.

958
01:18:50,786 --> 01:18:56,387
This will be our seventh annual fall festival and it is emerging as one of our most significant events, both for fundraising and community building.

959
01:18:56,908 --> 01:19:07,010
Our PTO raises money to provide enrichment activities for our students, support our teachers with supplies and enrichment kids and enhance curriculum, including art, music and educational field trips.

960
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:13,912
Funding for these areas has been significantly reduced or cut out altogether at a district wide level.

961
01:19:13,972 --> 01:19:15,573
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

962
01:19:16,333 --> 01:19:18,134
Sincerely, Brianna Lungelkorn, Mayor.

963
01:19:20,835 --> 01:19:23,497
On the motion of Councilor Carviello to approve.

964
01:19:23,877 --> 01:19:27,739
I just appreciate that the Mayor acknowledged that funding has been cut significantly.

965
01:19:27,919 --> 01:19:31,921
Yes, I do believe that was something that was transferred over, but thank you for pointing that out.

966
01:19:31,981 --> 01:19:33,222
Well, every signature's on it, so.

967
01:19:33,242 --> 01:19:34,202
Yep, fair point.

968
01:19:34,763 --> 01:19:38,845
On the motion of Councilor Carviello to approve, seconded by Councilor Knight.

969
01:19:39,365 --> 01:19:40,145
All those in favor?

970
01:19:40,586 --> 01:19:40,746
Aye.

971
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:41,846
All those opposed?

972
01:19:42,327 --> 01:19:43,027
Motion passes.

973
01:19:46,068 --> 01:19:55,113
22-518, the electronic delivery to President Nicole Morrell and honorable members of the Medford City Council for Mayor Brianna Lingo-Kern and Alicia Hunt, Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

974
01:19:55,733 --> 01:19:58,515
Regarding 22-518, the Medford Housing Production Plan.

975
01:19:58,535 --> 01:20:03,198
Dear President Morrell, thank you for the time and attention that has been paid for the Medford Housing Production Plan.

976
01:20:03,238 --> 01:20:12,383
As you are aware, this is a state recognized planning tool that under certain circumstances permits a municipality to influence the local- Madam President, motion to waive the remainder of the reading and move approval.

977
01:20:13,602 --> 01:20:21,327
On the motion of Councillor Knight to waive the remainder of reading and approval, seconded by... Madam President, roll call, please.

978
01:20:21,367 --> 01:20:23,708
Councillor Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

979
01:20:29,592 --> 01:20:32,934
I'm calling a roll because it's an official document going to the state.

980
01:20:48,275 --> 01:20:48,915
comes to roll call.

981
01:20:50,116 --> 01:20:51,797
And this is to waive further reading and approve.

982
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:52,397
Correct.

983
01:20:53,437 --> 01:20:54,158
Vice President Behrs?

984
01:20:54,178 --> 01:20:54,398
Yes.

985
01:20:55,258 --> 01:20:55,919
Councilor Kerrio?

986
01:20:56,039 --> 01:20:56,259
Yes.

987
01:20:56,819 --> 01:20:57,439
Councilor Collins?

988
01:20:57,659 --> 01:20:57,839
Yes.

989
01:20:58,380 --> 01:20:58,860
Councilor Knight?

990
01:20:59,020 --> 01:20:59,240
Yes.

991
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:00,541
Councilor Scarpelli?

992
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:02,121
Yes.

993
01:21:03,422 --> 01:21:04,963
I can't see him anymore.

994
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:06,664
He had to take a phone call.

995
01:21:06,844 --> 01:21:07,124
OK.

996
01:21:08,384 --> 01:21:08,905
Councilor Sang?

997
01:21:09,385 --> 01:21:09,565
Yes.

998
01:21:10,645 --> 01:21:11,146
President Morrell?

999
01:21:11,406 --> 01:21:11,586
Yes.

1000
01:21:12,366 --> 01:21:14,787
Six in the affirmative, one absent, and zero in the negative.

1001
01:21:14,807 --> 01:21:15,648
The motion passes.

1002
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:27,077
22-519, communication from the chair of the CPC to President Nicole Murrell and honorable members of the City Council, from Roberta Cameron, chair of the Community Preservation Committee.

1003
01:21:27,097 --> 01:21:34,342
Motion to waive the reading of the Committee of the Whole.

1004
01:21:34,482 --> 01:21:36,284
We do have Roberta Cameron with us tonight.

1005
01:21:36,304 --> 01:21:39,426
Would anyone like to hear from her, or do we want to send this right to Committee of the Whole?

1006
01:21:39,446 --> 01:21:40,467
Can we get a short summary?

1007
01:21:40,627 --> 01:21:40,847
Sure.

1008
01:21:42,897 --> 01:21:47,598
over to Cameron from CBC if you could just provide us a short summary of the document that you requested for us.

1009
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:49,159
Thank you very much.

1010
01:21:50,059 --> 01:22:01,342
So the Community Preservation Plan Ordinance or Community Preservation Ordinance was adopted in 2017 before the Community Preservation Committee was appointed.

1011
01:22:01,967 --> 01:22:07,749
And since then, we've had more experience about how the community preservation program operates.

1012
01:22:08,209 --> 01:22:14,351
And based on that experience, we're recommending some changes, minor changes to the ordinance.

1013
01:22:14,851 --> 01:22:16,432
Three items in particular.

1014
01:22:16,492 --> 01:22:26,915
The first item is just to eliminate some, a procedure that's because it's unnecessary, because it would actually be preferable for us not to have

1015
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:36,288
Any procedure spelled out in our ordinance gives us more flexibility to be able to collaborate with the council and with stakeholders.

1016
01:22:37,349 --> 01:22:43,335
And the other two are in order to simplify the process for appointing new members.

1017
01:22:43,896 --> 01:22:50,442
One of them takes away a prohibition about members of other boards and committees that aren't the statutory boards and committees.

1018
01:22:50,992 --> 01:22:52,593
serving on the CPC.

1019
01:22:52,953 --> 01:23:02,859
The reason for that is because we might in the future have an affordable housing trust and might want to have a member of the affordable housing trust sit on the CPC.

1020
01:23:03,159 --> 01:23:08,922
And there may be other boards and committees whose members would be valuable contributors to the CPC.

1021
01:23:09,442 --> 01:23:17,827
And thirdly, we are eliminating some advertising requirements that were written into the ordinance, which have actually complicated our ability

1022
01:23:18,348 --> 01:23:20,970
to recruit people to serve on the CPC.

1023
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:23,352
So we'd like to simplify that.

1024
01:23:24,753 --> 01:23:26,654
So thank you for your consideration.

1025
01:23:27,134 --> 01:23:27,454
Thank you.

1026
01:23:27,554 --> 01:23:27,895
Thank you.

1027
01:23:28,495 --> 01:23:30,016
Any discussion from the councilors at this time?

1028
01:23:30,577 --> 01:23:31,157
Councilor Collins.

1029
01:23:31,898 --> 01:23:34,199
Thank you, President Morrell, and thank you, Roberta, for being here tonight.

1030
01:23:34,219 --> 01:23:39,983
It was helpful to have the recommended changes and the current ordinance language in front of us ahead of the meeting.

1031
01:23:40,023 --> 01:23:42,145
Looking over it, it all looks very common sense to me.

1032
01:23:42,165 --> 01:23:46,748
If it makes more sense to discuss it in detail on Committee of the Whole, I'm certainly happy to do that.

1033
01:23:47,324 --> 01:23:54,886
Um, but you know, I appreciate the thoroughness, you know, getting a chance to see it at a time, and it looks like something I'd be happy to support.

1034
01:23:54,946 --> 01:23:57,047
So looking forward to discussing it further.

1035
01:23:59,607 --> 01:24:00,668
Councilor, Vice Mayor Fares.

1036
01:24:00,848 --> 01:24:06,929
And Madam President, just given the relatively limited scope of the changes, I think it may be, we may even be able to do it to her.

1037
01:24:07,269 --> 01:24:11,130
We'd add this with another meeting on the same night and get two things done at once.

1038
01:24:11,631 --> 01:24:13,271
I appreciate the scheduling recommendation.

1039
01:24:15,732 --> 01:24:16,512
Any further discussion?

1040
01:24:17,559 --> 01:24:22,782
So on the motion of Councilor Knight to refer to a committee of the whole as seconded by.

1041
01:24:23,243 --> 01:24:23,603
Second.

1042
01:24:24,383 --> 01:24:26,465
Councilor Carviello, all those in favor.

1043
01:24:26,825 --> 01:24:27,125
Aye.

1044
01:24:27,365 --> 01:24:28,166
All those opposed.

1045
01:24:29,246 --> 01:24:29,967
Motion passes.

1046
01:24:32,328 --> 01:24:33,369
Moving on to.

1047
01:24:33,389 --> 01:24:37,912
Madam President.

1048
01:24:37,932 --> 01:24:39,333
Councilor Carviello.

1049
01:24:39,353 --> 01:24:42,255
22503, did we waive the three readings for the traffic supervisors?

1050
01:24:42,955 --> 01:24:44,416
I don't recall that, yes.

1051
01:24:45,817 --> 01:24:47,158
The clerk does have an update on that.

1052
01:24:47,792 --> 01:24:48,653
Did we wait three minutes?

1053
01:24:49,013 --> 01:24:51,976
So Councilor Kerrio, we have an excellent question.

1054
01:24:52,877 --> 01:25:00,363
On both the loan order for the water maintenance, which is 22503, it's an update on both of them.

1055
01:25:00,383 --> 01:25:01,564
It's the same answer on both of them.

1056
01:25:02,024 --> 01:25:08,670
For 22466 and 22 and also the traffic supervisors.

1057
01:25:13,192 --> 01:25:27,112
you did waive future readings and then when bond counsel reached out to the treasurer and was putting together the loan documents, bond counsel informed the treasurer that

1058
01:25:28,073 --> 01:25:28,473
process.

1059
01:25:28,493 --> 01:25:28,533
Um.

1060
01:25:28,574 --> 01:25:33,118
Any ordinate any city ordinance and any loan order is required to take three readings.

1061
01:25:33,979 --> 01:25:45,171
Um unless it is advertised in full before the first reading, so, uh, it's going to have to take the normal three reading process and you will treat your votes from the last

1062
01:25:52,007 --> 01:25:52,768
the next next week.

1063
01:25:52,848 --> 01:25:54,629
I believe I believe it's the next meeting.

1064
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:54,769
Yeah.

1065
01:25:54,809 --> 01:25:58,691
Okay, so I just want to make sure I was I was I wasn't sure if that we did that.

1066
01:25:58,731 --> 01:26:01,213
Thank you.

1067
01:26:01,233 --> 01:26:01,933
Thank you.

1068
01:26:01,973 --> 01:26:04,214
So moving on to public participation.

1069
01:26:05,375 --> 01:26:10,138
Anyone who would like to speak on any subject relevant to the City Council.

1070
01:26:21,351 --> 01:26:24,874
the MBTA's bus redesign proposal, which is still on the table.

1071
01:26:26,196 --> 01:26:32,282
The revised draft is going to be released according to an article on boston.com by the end of October.

1072
01:26:33,572 --> 01:26:41,116
I don't know if the City Council has sent any letters in, but I would strongly urge the City Council to weigh in.

1073
01:26:41,896 --> 01:26:51,582
First, I saw last week that Mayor Rochelle Wu had just contacted the MBTA about the proposal with strong objections to changes on at least three of their routes.

1074
01:26:52,362 --> 01:26:57,725
I've been in touch with Representative Sean Gargali from West Medford, who represents part of West Medford.

1075
01:26:59,366 --> 01:27:00,907
He sent letters to

1076
01:27:01,927 --> 01:27:15,094
the governor and to Steve Poftak, the head of the MBTA, general manager of the MBTA, urging them to delay a decision on this until after the election so that the new administration can weigh in.

1077
01:27:15,835 --> 01:27:23,499
He urged, he mentioned that he is urging any other elected representatives to do the same.

1078
01:27:24,259 --> 01:27:26,240
The public comment period did end July 31st, but

1079
01:27:28,087 --> 01:27:36,170
Obviously since the local government is still weighing in, it is not too late and I would really urge the city council to weigh in.

1080
01:27:37,811 --> 01:27:41,372
Every bus in Medford would either be rerouted or eliminated.

1081
01:27:42,052 --> 01:27:53,757
I know in Hillside specifically, 96 would be rerouted away from most of Hillside, 94 would be rerouted to Burlington and reduced to the lowest frequency and the 80 would be eliminated.

1082
01:27:54,541 --> 01:27:59,506
It would reduce service in Hillside and West Medford substantially.

1083
01:28:00,047 --> 01:28:07,875
Many people in that area want access to the red line and Cambridge, not the access that they would be providing.

1084
01:28:07,975 --> 01:28:15,964
And I really urge the city council to put in some comments quickly before this final draft is approved.

1085
01:28:17,463 --> 01:28:20,144
is made public at the end of October.

1086
01:28:20,724 --> 01:28:29,726
I don't know what the procedure will be, if there will be another public comment period or if the board will just vote on it, but please, please give some support.

1087
01:28:29,806 --> 01:28:42,328
I believe we gave you copies of our 1600 signature petition from residents, but input from city government is invaluable.

1088
01:28:42,688 --> 01:28:43,328
Yes, thank you.

1089
01:28:43,348 --> 01:28:45,669
And we have sent comments as a body and that we of course

1090
01:28:46,594 --> 01:28:48,215
do once more and send individually as well.

1091
01:28:49,316 --> 01:28:52,958
I just want to, Mr. Clerk, can we confirm that they've received the comments that we sent them?

1092
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:56,880
I can reach out to them.

1093
01:28:56,900 --> 01:29:00,743
I know that I sent that out to them, and I've had several conversations with them since.

1094
01:29:01,263 --> 01:29:03,525
Thank you.

1095
01:29:03,565 --> 01:29:04,825
If you'd like me to follow up again, I will.

1096
01:29:04,845 --> 01:29:06,006
All right.

1097
01:29:06,026 --> 01:29:10,209
Please come up and name and address for the record, please.

1098
01:29:11,009 --> 01:29:11,610
Hello and good evening.

1099
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:12,571
My name is Bruno Overstreet.

1100
01:29:12,611 --> 01:29:14,592
I'm a student at Tufts University in Miller Hall.

1101
01:29:14,633 --> 01:29:21,739
I do not know the exact address, my apologies, but I would like to say thank you so much for letting us and all the other Tufts students here in the back corner attend your City Council meeting.

1102
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:27,165
We are all members of a class at Tufts called Intro to American Politics taught by Professor Deborah Schulkraut.

1103
01:29:27,805 --> 01:29:30,186
And we are here for an assignment, a civic activism essay.

1104
01:29:30,206 --> 01:29:35,069
We were supposed to go out into the local community here in Boston to learn about our local community and engage.

1105
01:29:35,109 --> 01:29:42,873
And we thought that joining a Medford City Council meeting would be an excellent way for us as students, a lot of us not from Boston, myself from Northern California, to get involved in the community.

1106
01:29:43,273 --> 01:29:45,634
So on behalf of all the tough students here, we would like to say thank you.

1107
01:29:45,674 --> 01:29:47,835
And thank you so much for all you do for the city of Medford.

1108
01:29:48,893 --> 01:29:50,394
Thank you for coming up, and thanks for coming out.

1109
01:29:50,434 --> 01:29:52,495
Sorry, sometimes we have way more interesting ones.

1110
01:29:52,515 --> 01:29:54,217
Sorry, this one was a little.

1111
01:29:54,437 --> 01:29:55,778
We're a little subdued tonight.

1112
01:29:56,158 --> 01:29:58,860
If you've been here in June, you could have stayed till 2 a.m.

1113
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:00,441
But I just want to add two things.

1114
01:30:00,501 --> 01:30:01,261
Thank you for coming out.

1115
01:30:01,642 --> 01:30:03,203
If we're not letting you attend, it's a public meeting.

1116
01:30:03,223 --> 01:30:05,284
Anyone can attend, and please register to vote.

1117
01:30:06,825 --> 01:30:07,125
Thank you.

1118
01:30:09,047 --> 01:30:09,827
Good evening again.

1119
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:12,609
Steven South, 106 Damon Road.

1120
01:30:14,505 --> 01:30:16,185
secretary treasurer of Teamsters Local 25.

1121
01:30:16,665 --> 01:30:26,427
I wanna talk about, you've heard some talk tonight about the state of the city and some of the things that are going on here.

1122
01:30:26,467 --> 01:30:35,889
And I've heard several words on this side and a couple over here about, I heard the word crisis, I heard the word disaster, I heard unacceptable.

1123
01:30:35,909 --> 01:30:39,090
And I just wanna talk first about

1124
01:30:40,243 --> 01:30:49,308
all of the vacancies right here in this building, the most top level positions in the city, department heads and assistant department heads.

1125
01:30:49,428 --> 01:30:59,173
And counselor Knight talked about it briefly, but I wanna give just a little bit more of a description of what's going on.

1126
01:31:00,314 --> 01:31:07,818
Vacant positions right now, chief assessor, assistant assessor, IT director who was terminated in January,

1127
01:31:09,205 --> 01:31:18,372
The assistant IT director, who's also known as the network administrator, who was terminated last week while he's on workman's comp waiting for surgery.

1128
01:31:18,973 --> 01:31:26,959
And I just want to point out that he was the only Muslim that works in city hall out of the many dozens of employees terminated.

1129
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:33,764
The elections coordinator who was terminated a few weeks ago after 30 years with the city.

1130
01:31:34,164 --> 01:31:36,666
And the IT director that I mentioned earlier was,

1131
01:31:38,407 --> 01:31:39,428
24 years with the city.

1132
01:31:40,228 --> 01:31:43,730
The assistant finance director who quit to go work for another community.

1133
01:31:45,531 --> 01:31:53,974
The co-directors of the Consumer Advisory Commission and another employee in that department all quit at the same exact time.

1134
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:55,875
They all retired together.

1135
01:31:57,096 --> 01:31:58,636
That department is dark.

1136
01:31:59,837 --> 01:32:06,200
The assistant procurement officer, the assistant HR director, the building commissioner,

1137
01:32:07,913 --> 01:32:14,679
the city solicitor and the assistant city solicitor, all top level positions within the city.

1138
01:32:14,739 --> 01:32:25,247
And when Councilor Knight said this isn't happening in the other communities around here, I can verify that we represent all of the surrounding communities and this is only unique to Medford.

1139
01:32:26,108 --> 01:32:28,990
So the question becomes why are all those positions vacant?

1140
01:32:29,211 --> 01:32:33,834
And I certainly can tell you the wages and benefits are unacceptable.

1141
01:32:34,995 --> 01:32:36,516
They're very, very, very low.

1142
01:32:37,096 --> 01:32:37,996
I'll give you an example.

1143
01:32:38,056 --> 01:32:41,497
The building commissioner, they've had it posted.

1144
01:32:41,537 --> 01:32:45,258
They're trying to get even internal candidates to take the job.

1145
01:32:46,418 --> 01:32:51,220
But the inspectors that work under the building commissioner make more than the building commissioner.

1146
01:32:51,740 --> 01:32:58,162
So how would any of the inspectors who are qualified take that job and take a pay and benefit cut?

1147
01:33:01,404 --> 01:33:06,213
Well, that's a union position now, the building commissioner.

1148
01:33:08,478 --> 01:33:12,646
There's a serious lack of respect at City Hall, and the employees here live in fear.

1149
01:33:14,464 --> 01:33:17,486
You see people walked in on a regular basis with two letters.

1150
01:33:18,507 --> 01:33:20,710
It's quite a tactic.

1151
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:24,633
They walk in, they sit down, there's the people in front of them, there's two letters.

1152
01:33:25,354 --> 01:33:27,776
One says, I resign, one says you're terminated.

1153
01:33:27,836 --> 01:33:28,877
And they say, choose one.

1154
01:33:29,218 --> 01:33:30,178
Today's your last day.

1155
01:33:30,679 --> 01:33:33,602
I can name scores of employees that have walked into that.

1156
01:33:35,517 --> 01:33:39,518
Talking about the wages, let's talk about this building.

1157
01:33:40,478 --> 01:33:50,941
The department heads and assistant department heads in this building haven't had a raise in almost three years since January 1 of 2020.

1158
01:33:51,781 --> 01:34:03,965
All of the clerical employees in this building and outside this building and other buildings that work for the city that just joined Local 25 yesterday, they haven't had a raise in almost four years.

1159
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:08,273
January will be four years since their last wage increase.

1160
01:34:08,853 --> 01:34:20,243
So when I met with these employees yesterday, I actually, one of them was crying that she can't pay her bills, physically crying, hasn't had a raise in four years.

1161
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:32,133
The next question that comes up is with half the department heads and assistant department heads vacant in this building, who's running the city?

1162
01:34:33,423 --> 01:34:34,384
Who's running the city?

1163
01:34:35,244 --> 01:34:40,948
And the answer is it's contractors, it's consultants, it's KP Law.

1164
01:34:41,889 --> 01:34:48,274
These are all for profit organizations that are running a large portion of this city.

1165
01:34:48,814 --> 01:34:50,435
And I find it to be unacceptable.

1166
01:34:50,655 --> 01:34:51,856
Something's got to change.

1167
01:34:54,458 --> 01:34:59,522
Many in and out of City Hall are talking about the city going into state receivership.

1168
01:35:00,612 --> 01:35:04,715
And I've asked that question at negotiations to the administration.

1169
01:35:05,576 --> 01:35:07,597
They just sit there and look at me, no one will answer.

1170
01:35:08,398 --> 01:35:17,844
But I will say this, that if this city is going into receivership, the council deserves to know, the residents deserve to know, the business owners deserve to know.

1171
01:35:18,865 --> 01:35:22,908
And it shouldn't be something that we read about in the newspaper after it happens.

1172
01:35:23,088 --> 01:35:24,709
If that's happening, we should know.

1173
01:35:27,308 --> 01:35:43,559
And the last thing that I'll say is that I know that the wages aren't raising up in the city and the benefits aren't raising up and the city's asking all the workers, not to give them what they deserve, but asking them to give concessions, which is unacceptable.

1174
01:35:44,439 --> 01:35:49,443
And the wages are not rising up, but the employees are.

1175
01:35:49,703 --> 01:35:50,643
They're all rising up.

1176
01:35:50,683 --> 01:35:51,804
They're all joining unions.

1177
01:35:54,124 --> 01:35:57,571
on my hands and feet of who's not in a union in the city anymore.

1178
01:35:58,192 --> 01:36:01,699
We've organized, I believe, five bargaining units just in the last 12 months.

1179
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:06,411
It's because people have had it.

1180
01:36:06,471 --> 01:36:07,392
People are desperate.

1181
01:36:07,672 --> 01:36:08,852
They can't take it anymore.

1182
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:09,973
Something has to give.

1183
01:36:10,393 --> 01:36:25,620
I would encourage everybody in this room, in the chamber, respectfully, behind me, on Zoom, to contact the mayor's office and demand that the employees in the city be treated with dignity and respect, and that they receive a living wage and benefits.

1184
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:26,280
Thank you.

1185
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:27,120
Thank you.

1186
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:27,941
Mayor President.

1187
01:36:28,521 --> 01:36:30,562
Councilor Carvilla.

1188
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:33,778
I had a chance to read over what you gave us.

1189
01:36:33,858 --> 01:36:36,543
I'm reading about the building commissioner.

1190
01:36:36,583 --> 01:36:42,914
It says within the six months, the city has retained the building commissioner to perform bargaining.

1191
01:36:44,325 --> 01:36:45,245
What is he bargaining for?

1192
01:36:45,885 --> 01:36:48,366
It's not bargaining, but performing our work.

1193
01:36:48,406 --> 01:36:51,307
We represent the position of the building commissioner.

1194
01:36:51,927 --> 01:36:57,289
But since it's been vacant, because the pay is so low, I believe the maximum pay is up to $109,000.

1195
01:36:57,329 --> 01:37:02,630
The employees that work under that position make more than that.

1196
01:37:03,170 --> 01:37:05,171
So no one's going to take that job.

1197
01:37:05,991 --> 01:37:08,552
And the labor charge that we filed is,

1198
01:37:09,607 --> 01:37:21,477
Now the city has has the building commissioner in Arlington coming over here doing some of the work of the building commissioner, but I believe it while while he's still building commission.

1199
01:37:21,557 --> 01:37:22,698
Well, that's the problem.

1200
01:37:22,778 --> 01:37:26,941
But what they're doing is they're saying, well, we can't pay him.

1201
01:37:27,953 --> 01:37:29,653
because that would be double dipping.

1202
01:37:29,713 --> 01:37:31,374
It would be a violation.

1203
01:37:31,914 --> 01:37:40,496
So he's volunteering his time, which again, the city right now has many- Who's volunteering his time?

1204
01:37:40,716 --> 01:37:52,619
The commissioner from Arlington, but just so everybody knows here, right now there's many open wage and hour federal lawsuits against the city of Medford.

1205
01:37:52,919 --> 01:37:57,280
And that's just opening the door for another one because it is a violation

1206
01:37:58,220 --> 01:38:05,866
of state and federal wage and hour laws to have someone volunteer to work for the city in that capacity.

1207
01:38:05,946 --> 01:38:11,810
So it's just opening up the city to yet another lawsuit, but we have a whole bunch of them, so it probably doesn't matter.

1208
01:38:13,031 --> 01:38:17,794
So the town of Arlington has no problem with him working here in Metro while he's working in Arlington?

1209
01:38:18,154 --> 01:38:18,574
I don't know.

1210
01:38:18,594 --> 01:38:20,416
I don't represent the building commissioner in Arlington.

1211
01:38:20,436 --> 01:38:24,619
I'm in this building two to three days a week, and I've never seen anybody in the building commissioner's office.

1212
01:38:25,559 --> 01:38:26,500
I don't know when this guy works.

1213
01:38:28,208 --> 01:38:33,873
Well, he's coming here and signing pertinent documents and doing things that the inspectors are not allowed to do.

1214
01:38:33,953 --> 01:38:38,197
And like I said, I know you can't work with two municipalities at the same time because that's double tipping.

1215
01:38:39,858 --> 01:38:41,780
Geez, he must be a hell of a nice guy to work for nothing.

1216
01:38:42,421 --> 01:38:42,861
I agree.

1217
01:38:44,202 --> 01:38:44,543
Thank you.

1218
01:38:44,563 --> 01:38:46,645
Madam President, if I may.

1219
01:38:50,108 --> 01:38:54,732
You know, a little more, whatever it is, three years ago or so,

1220
01:38:56,365 --> 01:39:08,434
something that I noted was we were forming a lot of volunteer committees, a lot of volunteer task forces, a lot of volunteer beautification days, volunteer beautification projects.

1221
01:39:08,555 --> 01:39:17,141
And I think at the time, I don't remember if it was in council or not, somebody noted that we have a lot of serious problems and it seems like the solution is to get someone to volunteer.

1222
01:39:17,481 --> 01:39:22,045
I did not realize it was actually to the level of we have a volunteer building commissioner.

1223
01:39:22,385 --> 01:39:24,347
I just can't believe that.

1224
01:39:28,357 --> 01:39:29,058
I can't believe that.

1225
01:39:29,779 --> 01:39:40,595
Thank you, Mr. So maybe you could explain to us what the role of the building commissioner is in the community and what role the building commissioner plays because it's my understanding that any zoning question

1226
01:39:41,752 --> 01:39:47,636
and the city goes to the building commission, and the building commission is the one that makes the determination as to how those zoning decisions are made in this community.

1227
01:39:48,337 --> 01:39:53,421
And we all know what a crucial role zoning plays in our ability to generate new growth.

1228
01:39:53,461 --> 01:40:10,033
And when we're sitting here, beating our chest after $49 million of deficit spending over the last three years, and no revenue generation plan, it might make sense for us to prioritize this position, because ultimately the building commissioner is someone that does help generate revenues through permits and fees,

1229
01:40:11,493 --> 01:40:19,436
and through rulings on zoning, as well as oversight of the code enforcement office, which is something that we all have had talks and discussions about in the past.

1230
01:40:20,076 --> 01:40:20,476
Thank you, Mary.

1231
01:40:20,836 --> 01:40:21,136
Thank you.

1232
01:40:21,757 --> 01:40:23,717
Does anyone else would like to speak for public participation?

1233
01:40:29,939 --> 01:40:31,580
Mary Anna Ducey, 2 North Street.

1234
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:36,702
I just want to add a little bit more to what Anita said about the better bus program.

1235
01:40:37,962 --> 01:40:45,444
the consultants said that they collected input from 20,000 people about the buses.

1236
01:40:47,505 --> 01:40:55,627
We, between Medford and Somerville, turned into the T, 2,026 on the petitions.

1237
01:40:56,487 --> 01:41:03,709
In addition to that, we posted notices at all the bus stops and many people called in or emailed in on their own.

1238
01:41:04,409 --> 01:41:07,110
Because I've met a few people that said, oh no, I already emailed in.

1239
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:23,708
So of the 20,000 that they've collected, I estimate that the Medford community probably had maybe 15% of what they submitted are probably related to what the Medford community collected.

1240
01:41:24,808 --> 01:41:30,311
So I think that they should pay attention to what Medford citizens want.

1241
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:36,034
We should strongly, strongly support our Medford buses the way they are.

1242
01:41:36,114 --> 01:41:37,615
We should not change those buses.

1243
01:41:39,357 --> 01:41:50,405
And I think of all the greater metropolitan area, if the Metro community can contribute 15% of the comments that they collected, I think that says something in and of itself.

1244
01:41:51,585 --> 01:41:51,946
Thank you.

1245
01:41:52,426 --> 01:41:52,746
Thank you.

1246
01:41:52,766 --> 01:41:55,868
Any further?

1247
01:42:00,272 --> 01:42:02,753
I say, do I need to do that again?

1248
01:42:02,874 --> 01:42:04,915
Every different item you speak on, you have to give it again.

1249
01:42:04,935 --> 01:42:05,996
Please, Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

1250
01:42:08,177 --> 01:42:16,701
Regarding receivership, Chelsea, is that the closest community that was involved in that recently?

1251
01:42:18,662 --> 01:42:20,382
Chelsea, Lawrence, Springfield.

1252
01:42:20,402 --> 01:42:24,844
So I'm gonna throw wacky idea out here.

1253
01:42:26,245 --> 01:42:27,085
I'm looking at you, Zach.

1254
01:42:27,706 --> 01:42:28,386
You're the money guy.

1255
01:42:28,826 --> 01:42:29,507
You're the numbers guy.

1256
01:42:30,147 --> 01:42:30,327
Okay.

1257
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:41,672
If we can't pay our bills, okay, you go into receivership, there's some sort of restructuring that happens, right?

1258
01:42:42,392 --> 01:42:44,973
Usually when that happens with businesses at least, right?

1259
01:42:45,253 --> 01:42:53,276
Some people, you know, people lose work, people get fired or laid off or so on and so forth because there's, usually there's a plan and part of that plan is painful.

1260
01:42:54,996 --> 01:42:58,218
What if there's no more Medford?

1261
01:42:59,018 --> 01:43:02,359
We take the East side and it goes to Somerville, right?

1262
01:43:02,799 --> 01:43:04,520
And we take the West side and that goes to Arlington.

1263
01:43:05,585 --> 01:43:07,186
or Winchester, and we just carve it up.

1264
01:43:07,826 --> 01:43:10,387
Take the land, dissolve it.

1265
01:43:10,427 --> 01:43:11,067
I'm against it.

1266
01:43:12,228 --> 01:43:13,769
I'm not saying anyone's for it.

1267
01:43:14,009 --> 01:43:14,749
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1268
01:43:15,009 --> 01:43:16,410
Yeah, I mean, just.

1269
01:43:16,930 --> 01:43:23,193
Yeah, where I'm going with this is unfortunately, I just want people to be careful that as far as services.

1270
01:43:23,393 --> 01:43:24,974
We're not going to succeed.

1271
01:43:25,454 --> 01:43:28,415
I'm not suggesting we had, but it also might be out of your hands.

1272
01:43:32,963 --> 01:43:45,672
If I may, Madam President, Mr. Mayor, you know, when I hear today about receivership, it actually mostly doesn't, I mean, we have financial issues to be sure, and I don't want to downplay them at all.

1273
01:43:46,412 --> 01:43:51,716
When I hear the conversation about state receivership or state input, it's not even a financial question.

1274
01:43:52,877 --> 01:43:56,979
When I'm hearing it, it's actually about management and the functioning roles of government.

1275
01:43:57,079 --> 01:44:00,921
It's not even, it's not just, oh, we have a 25% deficit.

1276
01:44:01,621 --> 01:44:03,202
You know, it's not about being bankrupt.

1277
01:44:03,742 --> 01:44:04,723
And again, I don't know.

1278
01:44:04,843 --> 01:44:11,466
I actually haven't heard anything one way or the other, other than the word has been put out there and people have said it may be a possibility.

1279
01:44:11,946 --> 01:44:14,428
Beyond that, I haven't seen a communication from the state.

1280
01:44:14,468 --> 01:44:16,248
I haven't heard that the city has received anything.

1281
01:44:16,268 --> 01:44:18,730
So, you know, I don't know any more facts than anyone else in this situation.

1282
01:44:19,470 --> 01:44:30,896
But when I hear it brought up, it's actually a question of is the basic functioning of government being accomplished by the people currently running the city, not a question of the financial piece.

1283
01:44:30,916 --> 01:44:41,080
Now, I may be, you know, again, I don't have a piece of information in front of me that explains what the conditions would be or why they would come in or what it may be.

1284
01:44:42,261 --> 01:44:45,883
I'd certainly be interested in seeing something like that or hearing more details on it.

1285
01:44:46,641 --> 01:44:50,365
Um, but yeah, I mean, it's I'm not hearing it as the city's bankrupt.

1286
01:44:50,405 --> 01:44:51,286
So that's why they're coming in.

1287
01:44:51,326 --> 01:44:51,887
I'm hearing it as

1288
01:44:53,130 --> 01:44:59,373
you know, we have a labor problem and things aren't being released and we have volunteer building, you know, that's where that's the context I'm hearing.

1289
01:44:59,393 --> 01:45:00,513
So I just want to put that out there.

1290
01:45:01,234 --> 01:45:02,274
We certainly have challenges.

1291
01:45:02,314 --> 01:45:09,557
We certainly have issues short term and long term around the budget, but that's not where I'm hearing any sort of state input in governance.

1292
01:45:09,657 --> 01:45:13,779
I certainly, if I had evidence to the contrary, I would, I would share it.

1293
01:45:14,359 --> 01:45:16,560
And to be clear, we're not hearing it through any official channels.

1294
01:45:16,660 --> 01:45:18,241
It's something that has just been brought up.

1295
01:45:18,281 --> 01:45:20,622
So just for anyone watching, like I don't want people to get

1296
01:45:21,924 --> 01:45:26,268
And I guess all I'm challenging is that... I think it was brought up through an official channel.

1297
01:45:26,288 --> 01:45:33,775
I think the gentleman asked the mayor, right to her face, in negotiations, and she asked the team, right, in negotiations, and they haven't answered the question.

1298
01:45:34,096 --> 01:45:34,316
Sure.

1299
01:45:34,476 --> 01:45:34,936
One way or the other.

1300
01:45:34,956 --> 01:45:40,141
And nothing's getting to us, but I guess to your point, something not getting to us doesn't necessarily mean it's not happening, so.

1301
01:45:40,962 --> 01:45:43,344
I guess I would ask you this, because I know you do a lot of homework, Zach.

1302
01:45:44,605 --> 01:45:46,227
There's other communities that have gone there.

1303
01:45:46,647 --> 01:45:47,308
What's the trigger?

1304
01:45:48,489 --> 01:45:52,771
and maybe we can be proactive and not dig ourselves into that spot.

1305
01:45:55,813 --> 01:45:56,173
Thank you.

1306
01:46:02,916 --> 01:46:04,477
Anita Nagum, Nine North Nav.

1307
01:46:05,457 --> 01:46:09,019
Just one comment on the reliance on volunteer labor.

1308
01:46:09,899 --> 01:46:17,323
It's all well and good to have volunteers doing things, but the problem is that it results in no accountability.

1309
01:46:18,573 --> 01:46:29,655
And I have seen the increased reliance on volunteers, and I really have strong concerns about lack of accountability.

1310
01:46:29,815 --> 01:46:40,537
And I really think city employees or employees of the city should be responsible for many things.

1311
01:46:41,897 --> 01:46:47,058
Volunteers have no accountability, and it leaves the citizens with no recourse.

1312
01:46:48,305 --> 01:46:48,845
Thank you.

1313
01:46:48,885 --> 01:46:49,986
Councilor Knight and Councilor Carviel.

1314
01:46:50,727 --> 01:46:51,307
And I agree with you 100%.

1315
01:46:51,347 --> 01:46:57,472
I mean, ultimately, especially what we're seeing in the committee trend right now is I don't want to make a decision.

1316
01:46:57,512 --> 01:46:59,373
So put a committee together and have them do it for me.

1317
01:46:59,954 --> 01:47:00,174
Right?

1318
01:47:00,294 --> 01:47:01,875
I don't want to make an unpopular decision.

1319
01:47:01,915 --> 01:47:06,078
So I'm going to put a group of people together to make an unpopular decision and say, don't blame me.

1320
01:47:06,138 --> 01:47:07,079
That's what they said to do.

1321
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:09,140
Right?

1322
01:47:09,201 --> 01:47:11,502
It's a leadership issue, really, is what it is.

1323
01:47:11,522 --> 01:47:12,403
It's a leadership issue.

1324
01:47:14,404 --> 01:47:14,925
Councilor Carviel.

1325
01:47:15,498 --> 01:47:15,758
Thank you.

1326
01:47:15,798 --> 01:47:18,180
I think Councilor Knight put it.

1327
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:19,962
Government by committee doesn't work.

1328
01:47:21,123 --> 01:47:22,384
Anything by committee doesn't work.

1329
01:47:23,184 --> 01:47:26,687
And so we have these people here.

1330
01:47:27,788 --> 01:47:32,712
We have KP Law working for us that has no vested interest in this community.

1331
01:47:34,654 --> 01:47:37,997
Well, they work for the city.

1332
01:47:38,357 --> 01:47:39,038
They work for the city.

1333
01:47:39,058 --> 01:47:40,179
They're negotiating for the city.

1334
01:47:40,579 --> 01:47:42,280
They have no vested interest in this community.

1335
01:47:42,641 --> 01:47:43,902
And now we have a building commissioner

1336
01:47:45,063 --> 01:47:48,266
who's volunteering that has no vested interest in our community.

1337
01:47:49,387 --> 01:47:55,952
That's, I mean, we've had people that have worked here, they've been department heads for many years, have lived here.

1338
01:47:56,273 --> 01:47:58,995
They had a vested interest in what goes on in this community.

1339
01:47:59,736 --> 01:48:07,463
This is where this, again, the volunteers, I'm telling you, I'm really baffled with this volunteer building commissioner.

1340
01:48:07,483 --> 01:48:08,784
I really am.

1341
01:48:11,931 --> 01:48:15,099
Going to Eunice on Zoom, name and address for the record, please.

1342
01:48:20,523 --> 01:48:23,606
I'm sorry, Eunice Brown, 48 Greenleaf Ave.

1343
01:48:23,847 --> 01:48:29,272
I'm changing the subject a little bit here regarding boards and commissions.

1344
01:48:31,395 --> 01:48:42,386
I emailed all of you over the past week or so and sadly never got a reply, but we currently have sitting on the historical commission, a Malden resident.

1345
01:48:43,427 --> 01:48:58,727
Um and I've brought this to the attention of the mayor and as I understand it and I was encouraged to see as I read the um uh new ordinance um that you sent to committee of the whole earlier that uh for the

1346
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:06,174
that there was going to be a residency requirement for that.

1347
01:49:06,194 --> 01:49:08,916
Um as I understand it right now.

1348
01:49:09,177 --> 01:49:18,885
Currently there is no residency requirement to sit on any of the Medford boards and commissions and the individual sitting on the historical commission from

1349
01:49:24,530 --> 01:49:26,430
There is no law that says she can't sit there.

1350
01:49:27,531 --> 01:49:30,891
So it'd be something that I would like to see addressed.

1351
01:49:31,091 --> 01:49:41,853
The mayor has told me that the only way for that to be changed and for a residency requirement to be added would be through the city council.

1352
01:49:41,873 --> 01:49:43,733
That's not true.

1353
01:49:43,753 --> 01:49:45,494
The mayor can absolutely remove people.

1354
01:49:46,014 --> 01:49:47,194
Point of information, Madam President?

1355
01:49:48,234 --> 01:49:48,714
Councilor Knight.

1356
01:49:49,774 --> 01:49:52,115
Also, it's important to remember, Ms.

1357
01:49:52,135 --> 01:49:53,675
Brown, that some of these

1358
01:49:54,967 --> 01:50:14,870
committees and boards are statutory and when you not necessarily backed by ordinance but but enabled through state law and in the majority of those circumstances and situations a residency requirement is outlined for example of a malcommissioned Brooks Commission the Brooks the Brooks Bar

1359
01:50:20,888 --> 01:50:21,769
and the like.

1360
01:50:21,869 --> 01:50:32,073
So it's important to remember that there's also state statute that covers and dictates a lot of the stuff that our ordinances support.

1361
01:50:33,373 --> 01:50:42,277
So through the chair then, I don't know, we have maybe 20, 25 boards and commissions.

1362
01:50:42,917 --> 01:50:48,360
So what you're saying then is that some of them inherently, because the statutory

1363
01:50:49,711 --> 01:51:10,403
do require residency and some of them do not and if that's the case how does one find out which ones do require a residency requirement and then of the ones that do not how could that be who has the authority to change it to make sure that

1364
01:51:11,535 --> 01:51:14,397
there is a residency requirement to sit on boards.

1365
01:51:15,218 --> 01:51:26,847
As the authority through a regulatory action to establish the protocols and criteria for which a member of a board of commission under her purview would be fit, residency can be one of those selective criteria that she uses.

1366
01:51:27,788 --> 01:51:28,168
Thank you.

1367
01:51:29,969 --> 01:51:31,931
Point of information if I can.

1368
01:51:33,112 --> 01:51:35,534
Another avenue would be to contact our city solicitor.

1369
01:51:36,294 --> 01:51:37,855
Yes.

1370
01:51:39,517 --> 01:51:40,297
Our city solicitor?

1371
01:51:40,337 --> 01:51:40,758
Exactly.

1372
01:51:41,721 --> 01:51:42,381
When we get one.

1373
01:51:43,442 --> 01:51:45,122
When we get one.

1374
01:51:45,162 --> 01:51:47,223
Who is the perfect response to that question?

1375
01:51:47,943 --> 01:51:53,425
Yeah, I mean, the other thing is that the charter gives the mayor near unilateral authority over boards and commissions.

1376
01:51:55,185 --> 01:52:02,788
Yeah, I mean, we talk about making decisions or not making decisions, and it seems to be it's another one where there's just not a decision being made.

1377
01:52:03,537 --> 01:52:04,437
by the person who could.

1378
01:52:04,497 --> 01:52:06,498
I guess I'm sorry to the chair.

1379
01:52:06,518 --> 01:52:09,259
The reason I'm confused is that she's bouncing it over to you.

1380
01:52:09,559 --> 01:52:11,039
You guys are bouncing it over to her.

1381
01:52:11,059 --> 01:52:13,820
I'm confused.

1382
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:15,921
We don't have appointing authority on that board.

1383
01:52:15,941 --> 01:52:17,341
We don't have removal authority on that board.

1384
01:52:17,361 --> 01:52:19,422
So I can assure you it's her and not us.

1385
01:52:19,682 --> 01:52:22,643
Yes, there is the ability of the council to write an ordinance around it.

1386
01:52:22,943 --> 01:52:26,264
But if this is something that bothers you and you want done tomorrow, the mayor can do that.

1387
01:52:27,884 --> 01:52:28,165
Thank you.

1388
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:39,088
On the motion of Councillor Knight to adjourn, seconded by Councillor Sang.

1389
01:52:39,149 --> 01:52:39,910
All those in favour?

1390
01:52:39,930 --> 01:52:40,632
Aye.

1391
01:52:40,712 --> 01:52:41,634
All those opposed?

1392
01:52:42,055 --> 01:52:42,757
Motion passes.

1393
01:52:42,817 --> 01:52:43,479
Meeting is adjourned.
