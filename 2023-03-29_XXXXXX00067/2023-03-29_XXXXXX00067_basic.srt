Hey, Medford Bites listeners. We've got some bonus content for you. The next couple of episodes were created by students participating in the Medford Public Library's podcast workshop. So I'm excited to present the Stupid Siblings podcast, Freaking Out on Science and Trivia on Air. Over the past month, I've been working with the Medford Public Library with participants in the workshop to create original content. The ideas and recordings were all theirs.

I just offered support in using the library's equipment to record their ideas. So I hope you enjoy.
