00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:01,031
Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:01,131 --> 00:00:05,532
Welcome to the July 25th meeting of the Memphis Zoning Board of Appeals.

3
00:00:08,893 --> 00:00:10,813
Do a quick roll call for attendance.

4
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:13,254
Jim Tirani?

5
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:15,914
Present.

6
00:00:17,135 --> 00:00:17,895
Kristi Evetta?

7
00:00:19,215 --> 00:00:19,595
Present.

8
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:21,636
Andre LaRue?

9
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:22,836
Present.

10
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:24,476
Mary Lee?

11
00:00:25,496 --> 00:00:25,896
Present.

12
00:00:26,737 --> 00:00:27,457
Yvette Velez?

13
00:00:28,337 --> 00:00:28,717
Present.

14
00:00:29,938 --> 00:00:31,258
and Jamie Thompson present.

15
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,941
Dennis, could you read the, I think we can, we don't have to read the open meeting language anymore, we can just go straight to it.

16
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:43,562
We do not, no, correct.

17
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,322
So I can just go straight to the 86 Suffolk Street, case number A-2024-17.

18
00:00:50,823 --> 00:01:03,133
Applicant and owner, Amy and Andrew Weber, to install an addition at 86 Suffolk Street within the front yard setback on Suffolk Street and the rear yard setback, which is not allowed for the City Measures Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, Table B, Table of Dimensional Requirements.

19
00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:10,339
Thank you, Dennis.

20
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,581
Thank you for seeing us tonight.

21
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:14,342
Hey, Amy and Andrew.

22
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:20,347
If you could just introduce yourself, name and addresses, and then go ahead with the presentation.

23
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:23,808
Sure thing.

24
00:01:23,908 --> 00:01:27,970
So I'm Amy Weber at 86 Suffolk Street in Medford.

25
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,951
And Andrew Weber, the same address.

26
00:01:33,272 --> 00:01:33,752
Wonderful.

27
00:01:34,592 --> 00:01:36,233
And do you want us to present in?

28
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:37,233
Yes.

29
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:40,114
OK, perfect.

30
00:01:43,255 --> 00:01:43,776
So we are

31
00:01:45,785 --> 00:01:46,305
Oh, thank you.

32
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:50,287
We're looking to put an addition on our home.

33
00:01:51,207 --> 00:02:01,851
It's about 264 square foot addition to the side and we're looking for appeal because we'll be continuing an existing nonconformity.

34
00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:05,853
We're not making it any worse than currently is.

35
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:09,495
but looking to continue along the same property line.

36
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:14,097
The lot that we live on is an oddly shaped lot.

37
00:02:14,657 --> 00:02:26,163
We actually have two front yards, so dealing with a variety of different setbacks, which really drives us to the specific direction that we're looking to go for this addition.

38
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:32,186
Okay.

39
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:35,288
Do you have any materials that you want to show the plot plan

40
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:36,900
that you want to review?

41
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:41,063
Sure, I'd be happy to walk through.

42
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:57,555
So this is the plot plan.

43
00:02:57,595 --> 00:03:01,839
As you can see, we have the oddly shaped lot here where we're on a corner.

44
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:10,581
Our front is Suffolk Street, but we are also on Wyman Street, and Wyman is also considered a front yard setback for us.

45
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:17,804
And so our existing dwelling in here today is obviously within the black.

46
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:22,747
And then what we're looking to add on here, the proposed addition, would be within the red.

47
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:28,069
And what this proposed addition will afford for our family is

48
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,393
an additional one and a half additional baths.

49
00:03:33,653 --> 00:03:41,619
So today we have only one bath for a family of four, which is interesting, especially as our toddlers are in potty training years.

50
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,765
But obviously will only continue to be a little bit of a hardship as they get older and into teenage years.

51
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:57,213
And then on top of that, I work from home full time, which is nice and allows me to be present for the children.

52
00:03:58,073 --> 00:03:59,735
But I don't have an office today.

53
00:04:00,255 --> 00:04:03,018
You can probably see we're sitting here at the dining room table.

54
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:12,086
When I work right now, I set up in our bedroom upstairs at a desk that we've turned into an office.

55
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:17,870
because the kids are home after school and so obviously can't be at the dining room table for that.

56
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:29,236
This proposed addition would allow us to add an office, add an additional bath and a half, as well as dedicated play space for the kids now, study space as they get older.

57
00:04:30,257 --> 00:04:34,179
The non-conforming, what we're looking for is along this line here.

58
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,181
It's tight, it's quite close, we know it is.

59
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:52,230
It's a 9.3 foot setback, which is, I believe it's 5.6 feet from the current regulation is what it is.

60
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,793
And what we're looking to do is extend and continue that existing nonconformity along here.

61
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:01,114
out an additional 13.9 feet.

62
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:10,918
And again, it's continuing the existing, not making any additional greater hardship.

63
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:13,379
Anything I missed?

64
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:27,613
No, I think the only thing I would add is you can see in the plot plan now, the existing is there is a kind of small mudroom off to the side that will be demolished.

65
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:37,860
And kind of we are just extending the width of our house towards our detached garage on a single story for 12 feet, as Amy mentioned.

66
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:43,168
Great.

67
00:05:44,068 --> 00:05:44,549
Thank you both.

68
00:05:45,609 --> 00:05:48,070
Any questions from the board while we get this up?

69
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,971
Or from the data that you've had to review?

70
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:53,831
Bill, did you mention it?

71
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:54,172
Go ahead.

72
00:05:55,492 --> 00:05:57,713
I do want to ask a question.

73
00:05:57,753 --> 00:06:04,915
I look at that front corner at 14.9 and ask why or should we consider a variance for that corner?

74
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:16,749
down by the front yard on Suffolk Street there, or it's moving from 25.5 to 14.9, that would be a variance in that condition.

75
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:18,830
For the 15 feet, correct.

76
00:06:23,975 --> 00:06:26,096
This would be considered a variance as well?

77
00:06:27,077 --> 00:06:28,698
You're encroaching in the 15-foot setback?

78
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,612
It's not an extension of an existing nonconforming, it's a new encroachment.

79
00:06:35,112 --> 00:06:43,576
So the board would have to consider both a variance for the front and a special permit for the nonconformity extension alteration on the backside.

80
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,719
Thank you, yes, that is correct.

81
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:58,062
I'm realizing now that it would be, that would be an additional

82
00:07:01,808 --> 00:07:04,389
Is that not right?

83
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,913
Is this not the right addition?

84
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:22,374
I apologize.

85
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:27,236
I think this looks like it's widening the house as well.

86
00:07:30,856 --> 00:07:33,497
which is not correct, I'm not sure what we have up there.

87
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:36,198
Yeah, you're right.

88
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:38,799
We're staying on our current property line.

89
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,260
We're not extending out forward here.

90
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:45,581
Apologies.

91
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:46,601
Let me see if I can.

92
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:51,402
You do show a proposed open porch there to some extent.

93
00:07:51,463 --> 00:07:51,943
Yeah.

94
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:56,104
It's exempt, but only if it's less than one-third the width of the house.

95
00:07:56,284 --> 00:07:59,165
I assume it's either structure or

96
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,951
non-exempt porch.

97
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:18,382
OK, let me, can you pull, you have the plans there, but that's not on the, apologies.

98
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:25,507
I don't know why, do you have the, you don't have a different one?

99
00:08:25,947 --> 00:08:26,768
I don't believe so.

100
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:28,169
OK.

101
00:08:29,486 --> 00:08:37,269
I apologize, that shouldn't be going that way.

102
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,151
We had plans initially.

103
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:47,472
We scaled the project back significantly.

104
00:08:48,392 --> 00:08:49,633
Could that be the old plans?

105
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:50,433
Potentially.

106
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:55,755
We met in front of the historical commission last year, or a year and a half ago now.

107
00:08:58,022 --> 00:09:02,585
with a kind of a larger edition.

108
00:09:02,605 --> 00:09:04,146
This is a scaled back version.

109
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:11,150
I think we've just gotten kind of, we're trying to find the, sorry.

110
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:23,178
The discretion of the board, if they were to include a variance and grant that variance and you built lesser, you wouldn't necessarily need to come back to them.

111
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:24,258
So that's just something.

112
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,120
Okay.

113
00:09:27,157 --> 00:09:29,038
I apologize, I think.

114
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:31,560
Right, because this is the current.

115
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,941
Yeah, this is the current.

116
00:09:33,101 --> 00:09:37,064
So when you look at the current plans here.

117
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:44,088
It's it's not changing the front and it's it's continuing the extended.

118
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:53,374
It's continuing the same and it's just a small little so apologies that that I shared was the.

119
00:09:55,924 --> 00:10:06,912
previous one, and I pulled it from your agenda, so apologies, because I thought I must have gotten my files confused and wanted to share, but.

120
00:10:07,612 --> 00:10:10,014
That was the document that was submitted with the application.

121
00:10:11,555 --> 00:10:15,018
Yeah, so the wrong document then was submitted.

122
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:17,039
That is my error, and I apologize.

123
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:21,322
We'll have to get the correct ones.

124
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,813
but to answer the question or to bring up again.

125
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:33,076
So we have our existing front here and then we continue on the same line.

126
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:36,918
So I don't have it within the plot though.

127
00:10:36,978 --> 00:10:39,640
So I'll need to get that and get the correct one for you all.

128
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:59,924
Okay, so I guess we would have 2 options because all of the documents that are part of the application.

129
00:11:01,885 --> 00:11:10,010
Are with the previous design, we can continue right now with the existing.

130
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,231
Documentation and that.

131
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:11,531
Front or.

132
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:21,491
We can continue to the next meeting with the updated documents.

133
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:23,733
Hey, Jamie, your audio is a little low.

134
00:11:23,753 --> 00:11:29,558
Can you see if you can boost it?

135
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:30,839
No, I just went red.

136
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:34,502
It looked like I got disconnected.

137
00:11:37,944 --> 00:11:41,427
If the documents are changing, they would have to resubmit an application, Dennis?

138
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:46,732
I don't think so.

139
00:11:48,550 --> 00:12:02,497
If one of the documents is correct, you can make your decision predicated on that specific document and require, which does presume that it would be fully compliant, and they can submit it if you're comfortable doing that.

140
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:12,421
If you need to see the literal numbers of the setback change so it's no longer a variance, then you would have to continue and ask them to resubmit, correct the document.

141
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:21,175
Do you have an updated plan Amy?

142
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:26,599
We're searching for one frantically.

143
00:12:30,762 --> 00:12:37,027
I don't think it's likely that we'll be able to get one within the time frame.

144
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:48,063
you know, probably if if the board is open to it, if we can take a cycle and make sure we have all of the exact appropriate documents, I apologize and represent at the next meeting.

145
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:51,965
Um, that, um, would likely make sense.

146
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:57,288
We want to make sure you all have your information and feel good and confident in in what we're doing.

147
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:57,388
Okay.

148
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,651
Um, I mean, I'm comfortable with that.

149
00:13:02,311 --> 00:13:04,892
Um, and that gets us all the accurate documentation.

150
00:13:05,373 --> 00:13:07,014
I just wanna ask the commissioner one question.

151
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:07,654
Um,

152
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,684
Commissioner, you mentioned special permit for the extension instead of a variance.

153
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:15,905
Is that correct?

154
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:23,310
I believe under section 94-5 for pre-existing nonconformities, anytime we extend or alter it, I believe it's a special permit.

155
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,751
It used to be a finding.

156
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:25,892
I think it's a special permit.

157
00:13:25,912 --> 00:13:28,854
It would not be a variance because they have not encroached further.

158
00:13:28,894 --> 00:13:32,657
They're simply extending it as I see it.

159
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:33,558
Yep.

160
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:37,928
Unless it creates the need for a new variance.

161
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:50,578
So basically, if it's an existing nonconformity and it's extended without creating an additional dimensional nonconformity, then it's just a special permit.

162
00:13:56,223 --> 00:14:02,628
So in that instance, we would still come back and represent with the request of a special permit instead of

163
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:04,612
Yeah.

164
00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:13,759
In theory, if everything is corrected the way you've described it, you would need just a special permit for the extensure alteration on the rear.

165
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:19,944
The variance up front issue becomes moot, and that's what would be reviewed.

166
00:14:22,686 --> 00:14:23,666
OK, perfect.

167
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:26,789
Can I just sort of throw out something?

168
00:14:26,989 --> 00:14:32,153
If that's the case, could the board tonight vote on the special permit

169
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:42,286
or the rear yard, and if it turns out they don't need the variance for the front yard, they've got what they need.

170
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:53,928
If they show us the changing plans and it's, you know, further than a foot away, it's longer than 15 feet away, moving forward, I think we can do that tonight.

171
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:55,669
I mean, I don't really.

172
00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:00,730
I'm comfortable.

173
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,570
For the board, anybody have any concerns with that?

174
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:15,117
Okay, so what we will focus on is the special permit for the extension of the existing 9.3 foot setback.

175
00:15:15,437 --> 00:15:18,319
So, variants of 5.6 feet in their yard.

176
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:24,603
And we will address the variants if necessary if.

177
00:15:24,803 --> 00:15:31,047
Or would that would that have to go to the building department or do we just continue?

178
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:33,509
That and then.

179
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,951
It was put in the notice like I actually had it in the notice.

180
00:15:36,991 --> 00:15:39,113
So, in theory, we could just.

181
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:48,459
Continue the variance until next month if needed, but if not needed, then we can just, you know, they could, they could withdraw their request for that.

182
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:49,340
Okay.

183
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,521
That works for me.

184
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:56,385
All right, so for the board, we are looking at only.

185
00:15:57,145 --> 00:15:57,325
The.

186
00:16:00,888 --> 00:16:12,534
So we're looking only at the extension of the existing rear yard setback that is 5.6 feet, and that is going to be a special permit.

187
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:29,342
So we're looking at any specific factors that may set forth socioeconomic communities, traffic flow, adequacy, compatibility, impacts the natural environment,

188
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:41,687
So, any questions to the applicant from the boards focused on the special.

189
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:57,218
Okay, we are open for public comment.

190
00:16:58,257 --> 00:17:04,280
Does anybody from the public want to speak on the topic of 86 Suffolk Street?

191
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:20,528
You could raise your hand on Zoom, raise your hand on screen, or you can email Dennis at dmackdougal.

192
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:26,371
If you can put it in the chat, Dennis, thank you.

193
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:27,552
That's dmackdougal.

194
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:31,064
at medford-ma.gov.

195
00:17:38,928 --> 00:17:40,248
I don't see any hands raised.

196
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:41,709
We'll give that a minute.

197
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:51,034
Dennis, do you have any emails?

198
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:54,635
Okay.

199
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:56,156
Do we have a motion to close?

200
00:17:58,508 --> 00:18:00,410
Thank you guys sorry I saw you shake your head.

201
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:10,118
And I do need a motion to close public comment and mention deliberation.

202
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:12,860
Motion.

203
00:18:15,382 --> 00:18:16,503
Thank you Mary do we have a second?

204
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:18,224
Second.

205
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:21,507
Jim?

206
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:25,911
Aye.

207
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:27,452
Chris?

208
00:18:31,738 --> 00:18:36,282
I. I. Mary.

209
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:43,007
Mary.

210
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:50,754
I sorry.

211
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:53,096
Thank you and event.

212
00:18:54,037 --> 00:18:55,618
I thank you.

213
00:18:56,647 --> 00:18:59,309
All right, we are in deliberation.

214
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:04,633
Anybody from the board that would like to make comments or have any feedback on this?

215
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:22,786
I guess I have a question with regard to the two-story structure, and you're extending one story of it.

216
00:19:25,084 --> 00:19:25,364
Correct.

217
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:30,608
We're currently a two-story structure, and the addition will be just one story.

218
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:34,711
That's it.

219
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:38,494
Thank you, Chris.

220
00:19:41,477 --> 00:19:43,919
Any other discussion from the board?

221
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:48,602
It just seems very straightforward to me.

222
00:19:49,183 --> 00:19:49,943
I think that it's

223
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:58,312
you know, meets the criteria, no negative impacts on the community.

224
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:01,574
Thank you, Andre.

225
00:20:05,957 --> 00:20:08,038
Okay, definitely agree with Andre.

226
00:20:08,318 --> 00:20:11,360
It's an existing non-conformity and extension.

227
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:19,085
It'll be an improvement to the property and it's not infringing in any way on anyone else's property or disturbing the community.

228
00:20:24,585 --> 00:20:28,306
So chair awaits a motion on the 6.

229
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:30,007
So the.

230
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:34,648
Motion to approve the special permit for a 6 of it.

231
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:37,889
Thank you all second.

232
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:39,889
Thank you Jim.

233
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,410
Roll call Jim.

234
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,291
I. Chris.

235
00:20:46,191 --> 00:20:46,451
Hi.

236
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:47,932
Mary.

237
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:48,612
I.

238
00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:58,122
Okay, thank you Amy and Andrew for the presentation.

239
00:20:58,142 --> 00:21:00,644
You guys were approved for your special permit.

240
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:06,370
We will continue the conversation with regards to the variants.

241
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:15,279
If you could submit the updated plot plan, if that's no longer an approachment on that front yard, then we do not need to meet on this next meeting.

242
00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:20,398
Wonderful.

243
00:21:20,498 --> 00:21:21,179
Thank you very much.

244
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:22,439
We appreciate it a lot.

245
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,160
Thank you.

246
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,560
You're welcome.

247
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:23,880
All right.

248
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,903
And just as a heads up, so I'll write the decision for you all.

249
00:21:28,963 --> 00:21:36,367
So as soon as I find out, if it turns out you don't need it at all, I can just go right ahead and writing the decision for the special permit.

250
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:42,071
If it's not, then I'll just, instead of having to do two decisions, it will just be one decision next month after that case is needed.

251
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:45,793
But for right now, once we sort of get that sorted out, we can go right ahead.

252
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:49,055
Actually, I think Mike's going to answer the question I was just going to ask.

253
00:21:49,095 --> 00:21:49,495
Mike, go ahead.

254
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:58,908
I wish I was 100% confident, but I do have procedural questions and concerns.

255
00:21:58,928 --> 00:22:09,416
I don't think we can really close the hearing until this issue is resolved.

256
00:22:09,516 --> 00:22:16,242
So we've voted on the special permit as part of the path

257
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:23,715
to granting all the relief, but I think we need to then continue this to the next hearing.

258
00:22:24,516 --> 00:22:36,580
And then in the event that we get something in writing saying, here's the updated plans, no variants being requested anymore, then we could close it in the next hearing.

259
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:42,102
And then at that point, that would be when the earliest opportunity to draft the decision.

260
00:22:42,322 --> 00:22:48,264
I believe well, in that case, maybe what I'll do is I'll draft the decision with just a special permit and then if it.

261
00:22:49,124 --> 00:22:51,825
Needs that we don't do it, then you'll get it right away.

262
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:52,845
So there won't be any.

263
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:57,487
It usually takes about a month for the month for these to get done anyway.

264
00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:57,787
So.

265
00:22:58,847 --> 00:23:03,608
It'll just be your instead of having to wait next, it'll be ready to go right away so that you get that.

266
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:05,729
And then once you get the, once you actually get the permit.

267
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:07,750
It gets filed in the clerk's office.

268
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:18,717
And then there's 20 days appeals period after that, and then once that appeals period is passed, you go to the clerk's office, get a letter from them saying it's not been appealed, then you can go get your building permit, so.

269
00:23:19,918 --> 00:23:25,242
Yeah, and we do have to vote on the continuance for the variance.

270
00:23:25,342 --> 00:23:28,004
So I do need a motion with regards to the variance.

271
00:23:32,927 --> 00:23:33,328
Motion.

272
00:23:35,629 --> 00:23:36,390
With the continuance.

273
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:43,636
For 8,000 so chair which motion to continue the variance for 86.

274
00:23:44,137 --> 00:23:51,761
Sorry.

275
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:57,044
86 suffix 3 to the next scheduled meeting of the zoning board appeals.

276
00:24:01,747 --> 00:24:01,867
2nd.

277
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:05,189
I need someone to move that.

278
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:07,250
Oh.

279
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,734
Motion I motion that.

280
00:24:10,935 --> 00:24:12,616
Thank you.

281
00:24:13,837 --> 00:24:14,438
Thank you.

282
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:16,219
Chris.

283
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:19,662
Hi.

284
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:24,246
Hi, Mary.

285
00:24:24,906 --> 00:24:25,147
Hi.

286
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:25,967
Hi.

287
00:24:26,027 --> 00:24:26,087
Hi.

288
00:24:33,964 --> 00:24:42,629
Thank you everybody so now we do have that we've got the formal continuance for the variance and we'll just need to address that at that meeting with an updated plan.

289
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:46,771
So, that you can see that it's not 1 if it's no longer necessary.

290
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:49,832
Thank you.

291
00:24:49,852 --> 00:24:51,793
We'll make sure we have all the right documents by then.

292
00:24:52,454 --> 00:24:53,554
Appreciate your understanding.

293
00:24:54,655 --> 00:24:55,015
Absolutely.

294
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:02,044
All right, Dennis, could you read the next case?

295
00:25:02,064 --> 00:25:07,285
133 Century Street Extension, case number A-2024-18.

296
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:18,867
Applicant and owner, Patrick and Jennifer LaRoy, to construct a porch at 133 Century Street Extension within the front yard setback, which is not allowed per the City of Medford zoning ordinance, Chapter 94, Table B, Table of Conventional Requirements.

297
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:22,688
Thank you, Dennis.

298
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:24,468
Do we have a representative from the applicant?

299
00:25:28,212 --> 00:25:33,063
I know, but I think they're having connectivity issues.

300
00:26:05,286 --> 00:26:13,148
Pat and Jen, I'm wondering, if you just want to call in and not do the video thing, I can help you out by putting your plans up here so people can see them.

301
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:16,189
If that would be easier, let me get the number for you to call.

302
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:21,070
I don't know if that would work or not.

303
00:27:05,887 --> 00:27:06,207
Hello.

304
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:15,449
Can you hear us?

305
00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:16,050
Can you hear us?

306
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:17,630
Yes.

307
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:19,451
Okay, great.

308
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:22,091
Hi, thanks for having us.

309
00:27:22,991 --> 00:27:24,132
I'm John LaVoie over here.

310
00:27:25,652 --> 00:27:26,712
Century Street Extension.

311
00:27:34,407 --> 00:27:39,492
As a couple of the plot plan, you can hear correct.

312
00:27:43,897 --> 00:27:46,059
Try turning your video off that might help.

313
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,041
Okay.

314
00:27:53,246 --> 00:27:55,068
Okay, we turned the video off.

315
00:27:55,168 --> 00:27:55,829
Can you hear us?

316
00:27:56,619 --> 00:27:57,540
Yep, that sounds better.

317
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,080
Yes.

318
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:58,921
Okay, great.

319
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:00,302
Thanks for having us.

320
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:04,525
Pat and Jen Lavoie, Century Street Extension.

321
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:08,190
Right down here at Playstate Park.

322
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,131
So we're not quite as prepared as the party before us.

323
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:17,153
We don't have documents to show you here.

324
00:28:17,894 --> 00:28:25,376
But when we left the engineer's office a few weeks back, we drove straight to the office and dropped them off.

325
00:28:26,057 --> 00:28:28,278
So I'm hoping you might have some documents there.

326
00:28:28,738 --> 00:28:28,978
I do.

327
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:29,498
I'll bring them up.

328
00:28:29,518 --> 00:28:30,218
Hold on one second.

329
00:28:36,639 --> 00:28:46,908
So we are proposing to put a 21 by eight foot, eight foot deep, uh, porch on the front of our house.

330
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:55,074
Um, I think it would be great addition, um, be able to sit out and enjoy the park.

331
00:28:56,756 --> 00:28:56,856
Um,

332
00:28:59,758 --> 00:29:04,101
We really didn't know that we were encroaching the setbacks.

333
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:10,165
We thought we owned to the curb, but we found out that's not the case.

334
00:29:11,946 --> 00:29:23,875
And so we're encroaching the setback by two and a half feet, and we're hoping that the neighborhood will allow and your board will allow.

335
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,872
Okay, thank you.

336
00:29:33,213 --> 00:29:35,476
Any questions from the board for the applicants?

337
00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:38,559
We've got an extension of a porch.

338
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:43,424
I believe the front yard setback ends up being three feet.

339
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:49,250
A variance for three feet on the front yard setback.

340
00:29:59,638 --> 00:30:00,218
Mike, go ahead.

341
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:06,841
Yeah, so I wanted to make sure I understood that comment correctly.

342
00:30:06,982 --> 00:30:16,446
So it does look like there's a sidewalk on the street.

343
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:20,308
And so if I understood correctly,

344
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:39,440
you own the land all the way to the curb instead of to the sidewalk, then this wouldn't be an encroachment, but because some portion, I don't know if it's the sidewalk itself or some point before the curb is, um, you don't own that.

345
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,242
That's why you need the relief that I understand that correctly.

346
00:30:43,063 --> 00:30:44,604
Yes, exactly.

347
00:30:44,664 --> 00:30:44,904
Mike.

348
00:30:45,184 --> 00:30:47,566
Uh, we, uh, we live on a private way.

349
00:30:47,586 --> 00:30:49,207
I don't know if that made a difference.

350
00:30:49,267 --> 00:30:52,669
We thought that we owned to the curb and, um,

351
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:58,774
As it ends up, that's not the way the rules work.

352
00:30:59,555 --> 00:31:03,457
You still have your, what is it, a 15-foot setback?

353
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:04,498
I'm not sure.

354
00:31:05,338 --> 00:31:19,266
But when our builder came down to the department to get a permit, something red flagged, and they thought that we should go before the Board of Appeals.

355
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:22,328
Okay, got it.

356
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:31,122
The 12.0 is from the front of the house to the sidewalk.

357
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:31,702
Is that right?

358
00:31:34,364 --> 00:31:34,764
Correct.

359
00:31:35,445 --> 00:31:35,725
Okay.

360
00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:36,686
Yes.

361
00:31:38,347 --> 00:31:38,667
Thank you.

362
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:44,211
Oh, and another question while I'm at it.

363
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:46,953
So looks like the property has.

364
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:54,334
two trees currently in proximity to where you're looking to build the porch.

365
00:31:54,354 --> 00:32:00,798
So are you going to have to remove those trees as part of this project?

366
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:03,840
We hope not.

367
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,781
I trimmed those trees back.

368
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:12,145
And I don't think that they're going to be an issue.

369
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:15,627
They don't.

370
00:32:33,008 --> 00:32:33,948
I think we lost you there.

371
00:32:54,738 --> 00:33:01,981
If you want to use the phone number to dial in and call into the Zoom, that should get a better connection.

372
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,008
Guys, can you hear us?

373
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:09,249
Nope.

374
00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:10,190
Yeah, we got you back now.

375
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,631
Yeah.

376
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:14,552
So we were talking about the trees.

377
00:33:18,114 --> 00:33:23,016
We did trim them back on the backside of the trees to the house.

378
00:33:23,056 --> 00:33:26,918
So I don't think that that's going to make any problem with the deck.

379
00:33:29,313 --> 00:33:32,274
and they don't interfere with the sidewalk.

380
00:33:32,974 --> 00:33:35,495
So I think we're gonna try to leave them as they are.

381
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:46,797
We may have to have them professionally trimmed, but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

382
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:53,839
Okay, go ahead, Mike.

383
00:33:54,203 --> 00:33:58,027
Yeah, a couple other questions.

384
00:33:58,047 --> 00:34:04,072
So have you had a chance to talk with your immediate neighbors about the project?

385
00:34:04,153 --> 00:34:06,555
And have they weighed in on it?

386
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:10,659
Yeah, we did speak with each one of our neighbors.

387
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:13,922
And you know what, let me take that back.

388
00:34:14,322 --> 00:34:18,947
We only spoke with the two houses on the right and the two houses on the left.

389
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:20,968
Okay.

390
00:34:21,588 --> 00:34:24,630
Right on my street, they all face the park as well.

391
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:28,092
And I think they're all behind us 100%.

392
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,774
They think it's great.

393
00:34:30,954 --> 00:34:34,817
I mean, we're not gonna be blocking any of their sunlight or anything like that.

394
00:34:35,077 --> 00:34:38,239
And we explained it to them in detail.

395
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:44,063
And from what I gathered from them, their feedback was all positive.

396
00:34:46,797 --> 00:34:52,881
OK, and then my last question, at least for now, it's a little hard for me to tell.

397
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:56,803
I pulled up the property on Google Street View.

398
00:34:57,544 --> 00:35:05,849
Is the front of your house roughly in line with the fronts of the houses to the immediate left and right?

399
00:35:06,009 --> 00:35:08,651
Or are you further forward?

400
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:09,912
Or are you set further back?

401
00:35:10,112 --> 00:35:11,213
It's a little hard for me to tell.

402
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:12,634
I think we're all in a row.

403
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:14,855
I think we're all pretty much in a row, yeah.

404
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:16,056
OK, thank you.

405
00:35:21,363 --> 00:35:22,244
I have a question.

406
00:35:22,444 --> 00:35:27,008
So the part of the land that you said doesn't belong to you?

407
00:35:27,348 --> 00:35:29,030
Does that belong to the city?

408
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:32,793
You know, Mary, that's a good question.

409
00:35:33,153 --> 00:35:41,421
We always thought we owned to the curb, living on a private way, because we all we all have to put in our own sidewalks.

410
00:35:43,523 --> 00:35:47,006
So we always thought that we owned to the curb, but

411
00:35:48,366 --> 00:35:55,452
Again, when we came down for the permit, we were told that, no, that's not the case.

412
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:56,914
We don't own to the street.

413
00:35:58,735 --> 00:36:05,502
So that's why we got the refreshed plot plan down at Medford Engineering.

414
00:36:08,504 --> 00:36:09,185
Commissioner, go ahead.

415
00:36:10,756 --> 00:36:21,823
Typically on a private way, they own what's called the fee in the way, which means they own either out to the center of the way, or they own out to the opposite edge.

416
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:27,066
All that confers upon them is the rights to use it and the responsibilities to maintain it.

417
00:36:27,506 --> 00:36:29,628
Their actual property is behind it.

418
00:36:30,028 --> 00:36:37,553
So while they're replacing the sidewalks, that's because they own the responsibility for fixing the pavement, fixing that, but that,

419
00:36:38,233 --> 00:36:43,857
Fee in the way is not actual property ownership, and they cannot use it as a part of zoning setbacks.

420
00:36:44,297 --> 00:36:45,398
So that's what's different.

421
00:36:45,698 --> 00:36:51,242
If that was a street by the city, then the city would own the sidewalks and replace the street and replace them.

422
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:55,585
But private ways are a funky setup with what they call the fee in the way.

423
00:36:56,406 --> 00:36:56,666
Yeah.

424
00:36:58,492 --> 00:37:03,455
Yeah, we've always enjoyed, I actually have been living here since 1960.

425
00:37:03,575 --> 00:37:08,438
I grew up a few houses down and we've always enjoyed living here.

426
00:37:08,498 --> 00:37:12,081
Kind of thought it was pretty neat living on a private way.

427
00:37:13,521 --> 00:37:15,463
Until the builder fixed the pavement comes.

428
00:37:15,883 --> 00:37:16,503
Right, right.

429
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:24,468
And Pat, how long have you lived in that house?

430
00:37:24,668 --> 00:37:24,949
32 years.

431
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:25,589
Okay.

432
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:26,169
All right.

433
00:37:26,249 --> 00:37:26,530
Thank you.

434
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,391
Thank you, Mary.

435
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:34,593
Anybody else from the board have any questions?

436
00:37:36,274 --> 00:37:47,424
Yeah, Mr. Chair, if I could ask a question of the building commissioner, and it's just a technical definition of what is considered an open porch.

437
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:55,091
What do you, or what is considered by the building department an open porch?

438
00:37:57,306 --> 00:38:02,270
Your typical single layer level porch with handrails.

439
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:10,315
It's a closed porch when you put a roof on it and you just screen it in for a three season room or you put walls in it.

440
00:38:10,896 --> 00:38:13,338
So that's really the difference at that point.

441
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,299
So this will have no roof?

442
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,381
Oh, yes, this will have a roof.

443
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:22,845
It's a farmer's porch with a roof.

444
00:38:23,326 --> 00:38:23,626
Yes.

445
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:24,207
All right.

446
00:38:24,247 --> 00:38:28,349
So it's open on all sides except for the house, obviously.

447
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,931
It's a closed porch.

448
00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:42,339
And if it were under a third of the length, we wouldn't consider it exempt from zoning like an open porch, which we typically view as your typical single level deck with handrails.

449
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:49,244
So this is really much more of an addition, even though he doesn't necessarily put fully enclosing walls around it.

450
00:38:50,004 --> 00:38:51,485
still viewed more as an addition.

451
00:38:52,185 --> 00:38:59,389
So they can have supports, obviously, to keep up the roof, but that's not considered a closed porch.

452
00:39:00,149 --> 00:39:00,609
Well, it is.

453
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:01,490
It's an addition.

454
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:08,073
It just doesn't happen to have fully formed walls, but it now it's now become something different than an open porch.

455
00:39:09,694 --> 00:39:13,756
It's a subtle difference, but it does change the loading characteristics.

456
00:39:13,856 --> 00:39:17,798
It changes some of the code characteristics of it versus a standard deck.

457
00:39:28,447 --> 00:39:29,028
Thank you, Chris.

458
00:39:29,088 --> 00:39:29,349
Thank you.

459
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:29,729
Commissioner.

460
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:31,332
Any questions?

461
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:32,755
Any additional questions from the board?

462
00:39:33,937 --> 00:39:40,789
Just wondering, is there a, uh, any kind of a. Of an architectural rendering or something we can look at.

463
00:39:50,961 --> 00:39:55,343
Dennis, did we leave anything like that with you, Dennis?

464
00:39:56,643 --> 00:40:12,730
I don't believe so, to be honest, because for this instance, because it was just dimensional, so I think that was probably all we just had was what I showed with the... Okay, could I describe it a little bit to you guys?

465
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,511
So again, it's going to be 21 feet long.

466
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,054
Pat, we just lost your audio again.

467
00:40:29,018 --> 00:40:30,582
You still hear me?

468
00:40:31,745 --> 00:40:32,447
Can you still hear me?

469
00:40:32,687 --> 00:40:33,189
You're back now.

470
00:40:33,922 --> 00:40:34,182
Okay.

471
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:41,867
Yeah, so it's going to be 21 feet long, it will not be centered on the front of the house, it's going to be a little bit off to the right.

472
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:48,412
It's going to be about two feet in from the from the far right hand side of the house.

473
00:40:48,932 --> 00:40:50,133
So it's not going to be to the edge.

474
00:40:50,153 --> 00:40:53,595
It's going to be about two feet in from the right hand side of the house.

475
00:40:53,675 --> 00:41:00,360
And then maybe eight, the far end of the other the left hand side of the house.

476
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,760
and it's gonna be eight feet deep.

477
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:09,403
It's gonna be held up by piers, concrete piers under the ground.

478
00:41:10,823 --> 00:41:23,968
And we're gonna have four posts holding up the architectural metal roof there, those nice roofs that everybody's using now, the black roofs.

479
00:41:26,669 --> 00:41:29,490
It's gonna have some electrical outlets on it.

480
00:41:31,549 --> 00:41:33,931
with some lighting on the ceiling.

481
00:41:35,552 --> 00:41:38,514
And I think we're gonna be using some type of Aztec flooring.

482
00:41:39,694 --> 00:41:40,615
It's gonna be really nice.

483
00:41:41,355 --> 00:41:42,436
We've got a great builder.

484
00:41:44,137 --> 00:41:45,958
He's done some great work in the neighborhood.

485
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,801
We've used them on other projects.

486
00:41:51,862 --> 00:41:54,244
And that's about it.

487
00:41:55,264 --> 00:41:56,545
I can't say it again.

488
00:41:57,406 --> 00:41:58,126
Yeah, that's it.

489
00:42:07,668 --> 00:42:10,869
Andrew, is that sufficient for what you were trying to say?

490
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:20,993
Yeah, I mean, I guess that's what we can get right now.

491
00:42:23,594 --> 00:42:34,338
I thought it was going to be an open porch, so I'm just absorbing the fact that this has a roof and it's a little bigger than what I was anticipating.

492
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,760
Mike, go ahead.

493
00:42:46,780 --> 00:43:11,005
Yeah, so one of the things the board is going to have to assess as part of this application is whether owing to circumstances related to the soil conditions, shape, or topography of the land or structures, a literal enforcement of the

494
00:43:12,353 --> 00:43:14,414
zoning ordinance would involve a hardship.

495
00:43:15,255 --> 00:43:21,037
And so I just want to make sure I understand the case there.

496
00:43:21,077 --> 00:43:29,342
So you mentioned that the position of the house is such that there's not really anywhere else you could add a porch.

497
00:43:29,422 --> 00:43:34,444
So is that where the hardship is stemming from?

498
00:43:34,604 --> 00:43:41,708
It's that either the porch would be too narrow or you'd have to move the house.

499
00:43:44,882 --> 00:43:50,924
Right, I mean, yes, in order to stay away from encroaching the boundaries, yes.

500
00:43:55,245 --> 00:44:05,509
To view the park, I mean, we're just about ready to retire and we thought it would be great to have a porch to sit out and take it all in.

501
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:13,832
We wanted to go forward with an eight foot porch.

502
00:44:16,092 --> 00:44:25,662
We've been around the neighborhood and we've checked out what a six foot porch is and what a seven foot porch is and what an eight foot porch is.

503
00:44:25,782 --> 00:44:28,485
And clearly an eight foot porch is comfortable.

504
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:47,075
OK, and then so the other thing we need to establish as part of this is that these conditions don't generally affect the zoning district in which your house is located.

505
00:44:47,195 --> 00:44:55,742
So are your neighbors able to build a porch like this on their properties?

506
00:44:55,802 --> 00:45:00,045
And this is something unique to the position of your house

507
00:45:02,493 --> 00:45:03,675
is preventing you from doing it?

508
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:08,963
Yeah, Mike, I'm sorry.

509
00:45:09,464 --> 00:45:11,166
At the beginning, you were cut off a little bit.

510
00:45:11,447 --> 00:45:12,468
Oh, yeah, sorry.

511
00:45:12,688 --> 00:45:13,209
I'll restate.

512
00:45:13,249 --> 00:45:16,875
So essentially, I already mentioned the

513
00:45:19,025 --> 00:45:25,468
we have to relate the relief to something about, in this case, I guess, the position of the structure.

514
00:45:27,109 --> 00:45:34,753
But then the second part is that something can't generally affect the zoning district in which you're located.

515
00:45:34,873 --> 00:45:37,614
So I'd just like to better understand

516
00:45:39,767 --> 00:45:50,274
Are your neighbors' houses positioned such that they could build similar sized covered porches in the front of their properties?

517
00:45:50,434 --> 00:45:51,995
Or are all the houses?

518
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,738
No, we all face the park.

519
00:45:57,299 --> 00:46:01,161
And I think we all have approximately the same setbacks.

520
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:15,278
I wouldn't be surprised if some other people, this may prompt other people to put a porch on the front of their house.

521
00:46:15,338 --> 00:46:17,500
I mean, I think it's a great street to have a porch.

522
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,542
I mean, the park is beautiful.

523
00:46:19,922 --> 00:46:22,824
And right now I have to sit out on my brick stairs.

524
00:46:24,265 --> 00:46:25,686
And I'd love to have a porch.

525
00:46:27,468 --> 00:46:28,248
OK, thank you.

526
00:46:32,912 --> 00:46:33,352
Thank you, Mike.

527
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:48,429
Hi, so I pull up the picture of the house on my computer and you're talking about the porch built between the first level and the second level and it's extending to the street.

528
00:46:49,169 --> 00:46:49,710
Is that correct?

529
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,771
I'm just, again, I'm just trying to understand.

530
00:46:52,652 --> 00:46:52,992
Yes.

531
00:46:53,272 --> 00:47:00,678
So if you look at the house with the Google search, you'll see that vestibule on the front of the house.

532
00:47:02,312 --> 00:47:11,594
So obviously that vestibule will be demoed and it's going to be that same height.

533
00:47:17,555 --> 00:47:18,755
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

534
00:47:20,935 --> 00:47:24,956
See the four steps lead up to the landing on Mary Lee?

535
00:47:24,996 --> 00:47:26,696
Yes, I see the four steps.

536
00:47:27,576 --> 00:47:27,836
Yes.

537
00:47:28,096 --> 00:47:31,257
So that will be the level of the proposed deck.

538
00:47:32,655 --> 00:47:33,015
porch.

539
00:47:35,836 --> 00:47:38,237
Okay.

540
00:47:38,357 --> 00:47:42,039
So that's where that the porch will extend.

541
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:44,880
I'm trying to figure out where it extends.

542
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,461
It will extend towards the front of the street, right?

543
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:48,281
Correct.

544
00:47:49,342 --> 00:47:49,602
Yes.

545
00:47:49,762 --> 00:47:51,542
It will be from the face of the house.

546
00:47:52,183 --> 00:47:56,604
It will be eight feet off of the face of the house towards the sidewalk.

547
00:47:58,545 --> 00:47:59,205
Towards the sidewalk.

548
00:47:59,306 --> 00:47:59,586
Okay.

549
00:47:59,826 --> 00:47:59,946
And

550
00:48:01,517 --> 00:48:07,882
And the part where you mentioned before that's not owned by you, which part is that?

551
00:48:11,304 --> 00:48:25,594
Basically, from the sidewalk, from what I understand, that full sidewalk that we put in, in that little strip of grass right to the curb, I don't think we own it.

552
00:48:27,649 --> 00:48:30,151
Oh, okay, okay, I see, I see.

553
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:37,997
So between the two plots, the two portions of grass, there is, that looks like a path.

554
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:39,919
Yes.

555
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:43,982
So the porch will not, right?

556
00:48:44,343 --> 00:48:49,307
So the porch will not affect that little path.

557
00:48:49,987 --> 00:48:50,908
Oh no, no.

558
00:48:50,988 --> 00:48:52,969
And it won't, it won't affect the sidewalk either.

559
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:54,991
Okay.

560
00:48:55,011 --> 00:48:55,692
All right.

561
00:48:55,752 --> 00:48:56,032
Thank you.

562
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:04,614
Thank you, Mary.

563
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:05,915
Any other questions from the board?

564
00:49:08,897 --> 00:49:10,118
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

565
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:22,808
To me, this sounds like something that would be great, not only for the applicant, but to encourage people to be out looking at the field.

566
00:49:24,198 --> 00:49:33,062
I've spent many an hour at that field with my kids over the years, and it's nice to have the neighbors involved and able to enjoy that.

567
00:49:33,142 --> 00:49:41,006
So it seems like something that's honestly a no-brainer in some ways.

568
00:49:41,286 --> 00:49:47,989
My only concern, I guess, would be, does the open porch turn into a closed porch?

569
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:59,134
turn into another room in the house eventually, which is what I think happens over the years.

570
00:49:59,174 --> 00:50:03,716
I can tell you from personal experience in my parents' house, that's exactly what happened.

571
00:50:04,296 --> 00:50:17,320
So I'm sure that if anyone were to enclose it, they'd have to then go back to the building department, get the proper permit,

572
00:50:18,777 --> 00:50:21,619
for and possibly be sent back to us.

573
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,762
Hence my question earlier about the open porch versus closed porch.

574
00:50:26,763 --> 00:50:36,170
Other than that, as the application sits before us, I think it's fine.

575
00:50:38,472 --> 00:50:39,272
Thank you, Chris.

576
00:50:40,653 --> 00:50:44,756
The building commissioner, I guess, in a way, a follow-up, if you will.

577
00:50:45,857 --> 00:50:46,738
Mr. Commissioner, if you

578
00:50:47,922 --> 00:50:54,154
could speak on people enclosing their porches eventually from an open porch to a closed porch to a room?

579
00:50:56,659 --> 00:50:58,142
It's certainly very common.

580
00:50:59,697 --> 00:51:07,159
I certainly know of homes that have done that and put another porch on it, closed that, and over time have encroached over space.

581
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:09,299
They would come for a building permit.

582
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:16,561
I don't see that they would need to come back before the board because you've already granted them the dimensional spaces.

583
00:51:17,501 --> 00:51:19,482
They're just filling in the holes between.

584
00:51:31,537 --> 00:51:32,257
Thank you, Commissioner.

585
00:51:32,277 --> 00:51:32,818
Thank you, Chris.

586
00:51:35,139 --> 00:51:37,680
Any other questions from the board for the afternoon?

587
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:44,184
Looks like we're good.

588
00:51:44,524 --> 00:51:46,285
I will open us up for public comment.

589
00:51:47,005 --> 00:51:57,671
Is there anybody on the call that would like to speak with regards to 133 Century Street extension?

590
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:01,113
Please raise your hand on Zoom.

591
00:52:01,903 --> 00:52:06,667
or email Dennis at dmcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

592
00:52:06,687 --> 00:52:23,902
I don't see any hands raised on Zoom.

593
00:52:23,922 --> 00:52:25,263
Dennis, do you have anything in email?

594
00:52:26,645 --> 00:52:27,025
I do not.

595
00:52:28,483 --> 00:52:28,864
Thank you.

596
00:52:29,244 --> 00:52:33,067
I need a motion to close public comment and open deliberation.

597
00:52:37,831 --> 00:52:38,211
Motion.

598
00:52:39,212 --> 00:52:39,512
Second.

599
00:52:39,792 --> 00:52:40,093
Thank you.

600
00:52:40,853 --> 00:52:41,254
Thank you.

601
00:52:44,636 --> 00:52:44,896
Jim?

602
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:52,923
Jim?

603
00:52:59,848 --> 00:53:00,789
Go to Yvette Feliz.

604
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:02,470
Aye.

605
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:04,351
Mary Lee.

606
00:53:05,351 --> 00:53:05,491
Aye.

607
00:53:06,752 --> 00:53:07,272
Andre Leroux.

608
00:53:07,933 --> 00:53:08,153
Aye.

609
00:53:09,473 --> 00:53:10,134
Mike Calderon.

610
00:53:11,174 --> 00:53:11,314
Aye.

611
00:53:12,175 --> 00:53:12,935
And Kustya Venna.

612
00:53:14,056 --> 00:53:14,176
Aye.

613
00:53:15,917 --> 00:53:16,457
Thank you guys.

614
00:53:16,757 --> 00:53:17,838
You guys will be taking the vote.

615
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:25,062
We are in deliberation and again thank you Mike earlier again this is a variant so we're going to be looking at

616
00:53:25,917 --> 00:53:48,405
Owing to the circumstances relating to soil conditions, shape, or topography of such land or structures, literal enforcement of provisions of the ordinance or bylaw would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner, and that relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of the ordinance or bylaw.

617
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:52,986
And I think the, let me go to deliberation.

618
00:53:53,747 --> 00:53:54,907
Does anybody want to start?

619
00:54:06,468 --> 00:54:10,952
I'm a little concerned.

620
00:54:10,972 --> 00:54:25,703
I always get a little concerned when we kind of set a precedent for moving into the front yard, you know, building into the front yard, whether that's a parking space or anything else.

621
00:54:26,624 --> 00:54:27,665
But I think.

622
00:54:29,834 --> 00:54:34,539
In this circumstance, I was looking at the other houses on the street.

623
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:41,247
Many of them have larger side yards where they can put porches.

624
00:54:41,267 --> 00:54:50,277
I think for this purpose and given the fact that it's facing a park, I think it's appropriate.

625
00:54:55,585 --> 00:54:58,627
Andre, just a clarifying question, because I didn't look at that.

626
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:03,649
Does it seem like the other properties have side yards where they could put covered porches?

627
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:16,015
Yeah, there's at least a couple of houses within just a few houses that have covered side yard porches.

628
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:17,456
OK.

629
00:55:27,598 --> 00:55:29,118
Go ahead, Mike.

630
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:30,839
Yeah, I can go next.

631
00:55:30,999 --> 00:55:35,459
So I'm very familiar with the street in the park.

632
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:40,020
I think it sounds like a really nice project.

633
00:55:42,681 --> 00:55:55,483
Where I'm hung up is it seems to me like not having the space for an eight-foot covered porch in the front yard

634
00:55:56,585 --> 00:56:00,347
is an issue that generally affects that whole street.

635
00:56:02,488 --> 00:56:17,776
And if indeed the hardship generally affects the zoning district, then that's the area where a project like this wouldn't maybe not meet the standard for a variance.

636
00:56:18,336 --> 00:56:21,238
I don't see a detriment to the

637
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:36,171
public good, and it would be nice to have something in writing from the neighbors, but I'll, you know, it, it sounds like a perfectly reasonable project, but that's my current hang up.

638
00:56:36,231 --> 00:56:46,979
I don't, I don't know if there's anything really unusual about this property that justifies the variance.

639
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:53,840
Actually, I got a question about that.

640
00:56:54,120 --> 00:57:10,286
The way that I interpret it was that because other properties on the street have enough side yards, they could accommodate a covered porch on the side, but this property can't, which is the hardship.

641
00:57:14,288 --> 00:57:20,350
Through the chair, that was partly why I asked you the question, Andre, because I hadn't noticed that.

642
00:57:21,325 --> 00:57:23,126
So I'm trying to take a look now.

643
00:57:23,146 --> 00:57:34,094
It's a little hard for me to tell which specific houses you were referring to.

644
00:57:34,235 --> 00:57:42,721
But I do see, yeah, I guess I see some houses where they have maybe a covered porch in the back.

645
00:57:44,282 --> 00:57:46,524
But it looks like those are all conforming.

646
00:57:48,945 --> 00:57:50,126
So then, yeah, this house.

647
00:57:55,998 --> 00:57:58,959
It has a deck in the back.

648
00:58:04,002 --> 00:58:18,971
Yeah, so I think if the board were to find, Andre, that there's something about the position of the structures or the shape of the lot on this property that

649
00:58:21,006 --> 00:58:43,640
prevents building a covered porch of this size anywhere where other properties nearby can or especially do have something similar in size and magnitude, that would be an angle to say that the relief doesn't generally affect the zoning district.

650
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:48,883
But then I also think it would be perfectly reasonable to take the interpretation that

651
00:58:50,421 --> 00:58:56,862
not having a covered porch in the front is the criteria.

652
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:02,904
It really just depends on how you want to interpret that part of the standard.

653
00:59:03,204 --> 00:59:13,146
I still am not a 100 percent sure I'm seeing the examples you're referring to about other properties with covered porches.

654
00:59:14,046 --> 00:59:14,966
Yeah, I would look at 151 and 107. 151.

655
00:59:21,529 --> 00:59:24,330
Okay, yeah, covered porch in the side yard there.

656
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:28,493
Looks probably non-conforming.

657
00:59:29,213 --> 00:59:33,135
I believe 119 also.

658
00:59:33,155 --> 00:59:34,516
119, that looks like a garage.

659
00:59:34,836 --> 00:59:35,936
Oh, no, yeah, I see it, yep.

660
00:59:36,016 --> 00:59:36,457
And then 107.

661
00:59:36,757 --> 00:59:39,958
Yeah, okay.

662
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:50,984
Well, I would even say the house next door at some point had, because it looks like their extension, their house has an extension on the left.

663
00:59:52,546 --> 00:59:58,651
And that could have been a porch at some point, but they haven't closed it now because of the way it's set up.

664
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:03,455
It looks like a three seasons space.

665
01:00:03,896 --> 01:00:15,205
And I see that also throughout the block, that those types of things exist, or they have that room, but then there's a porch on the second floor.

666
01:00:22,175 --> 01:00:27,898
I also think the unique thing about this is that they live abutting a park.

667
01:00:28,579 --> 01:00:37,524
So it's, you know, when we talk about not detrimental to the community, you know, it's not encroaching on like public space or taking away park space.

668
01:00:38,564 --> 01:00:46,328
And I think we've heard from other folks in our group saying, you know, looking forward to having an audience, right?

669
01:00:46,989 --> 01:00:48,910
So I think that's like a community benefit too.

670
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:56,174
Yeah, if I may, if I may add another comment, Mr chairman.

671
01:00:56,955 --> 01:01:03,883
Yeah, I think this is I you know it's kind of weird because if you look, literally across the street from the park.

672
01:01:04,845 --> 01:01:05,766
You see all these.

673
01:01:07,105 --> 01:01:11,993
older houses that have large porches and they're just a few feet away from the sidewalk.

674
01:01:13,335 --> 01:01:21,468
So this just happened to be a development that happened, you know, probably of the same builder.

675
01:01:23,087 --> 01:01:26,769
you know, 80 years ago or however many years those houses were built.

676
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:33,374
And the time, the style of the day didn't have porches.

677
01:01:33,674 --> 01:01:48,924
And so I don't really think we can assign zoning per se of the, you know, the area that we're talking about because

678
01:01:50,448 --> 01:02:02,851
Like, you know, literally across the street from the park on the other side, there are these large sort of Victorian and turn-of-the-century houses all with front porches.

679
01:02:03,872 --> 01:02:16,835
It happens to be that these houses on the other side, which were developed later, somehow the style was to omit or, you know, not build the front porch for whatever reason.

680
01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:17,575
We don't really know.

681
01:02:21,902 --> 01:02:38,252
As Yvette just said, my feeling is that it's obviously a benefit to the applicant, but it's a benefit, I think, to the community to have people participate more in the outdoor world.

682
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:42,315
Being across from the park is one of those big benefits.

683
01:02:46,618 --> 01:02:47,138
Thank you, Chris.

684
01:02:47,178 --> 01:02:48,579
I just want to jump over to Dennis.

685
01:02:48,619 --> 01:02:49,540
He's got his hand raised.

686
01:02:51,015 --> 01:02:57,701
This is more just because I was able to call up on our software here, and so I don't know if this will help, but it sort of gives some context.

687
01:02:57,721 --> 01:03:03,526
So 133 is about 55 feet wide, and 139 next door is 65, 143 is 70 feet wide, and then 151 goes to about 60, and then going the other direction,

688
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:15,337
127 is about a little bit the same, but 119 is I think 80 feet wide.

689
01:03:15,397 --> 01:03:17,319
So there's pretty big discrepancy.

690
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:23,242
Like these weren't evenly, like you look in the street behind them, all the lots are exactly the same.

691
01:03:23,802 --> 01:03:28,045
This street has many different widths all up and down it.

692
01:03:28,925 --> 01:03:35,389
So I don't know if that, just because I mean, Mike, you were sort of talking about like the widths and things like that and trying to get context.

693
01:03:35,449 --> 01:03:37,471
And I figured that would sort of help just giving some numbers.

694
01:03:37,991 --> 01:03:38,291
Sure.

695
01:03:38,391 --> 01:03:39,292
Yeah.

696
01:03:39,312 --> 01:03:39,592
Thank you.

697
01:03:42,053 --> 01:03:43,573
Thank you, Dennis, very much.

698
01:03:44,994 --> 01:03:45,594
Mary, go ahead.

699
01:03:55,117 --> 01:03:57,438
Mary, you got your hand raised?

700
01:04:01,959 --> 01:04:02,519
Can you hear me?

701
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:03,940
Yep, we can now.

702
01:04:04,442 --> 01:04:13,627
Okay, so initially, I thought there was going to be an issue with the ownership of that.

703
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:23,292
I think that small portion in front of the house, but I think that Pat indicated that he lived there for 32 years.

704
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:30,976
So I think that eliminated the ownership issue based on adverse possession.

705
01:04:33,113 --> 01:04:42,016
And I think that is why this matter is before the board, right, because of that ownership of that strip of land.

706
01:04:44,136 --> 01:04:45,517
That's why he needed the variance.

707
01:04:46,837 --> 01:04:59,581
He needs the variance because the front yard setback to the private way, which is community owned, where they have the fee of access is a 15-yard setback.

708
01:05:03,281 --> 01:05:12,889
So, so, so I think the fact that he's been there for over 32 years or 32 years that negates that issue.

709
01:05:17,093 --> 01:05:18,694
So, I think no, it's the same.

710
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:21,336
It's the same situation as if it were city property.

711
01:05:22,197 --> 01:05:26,621
If it were the city street, it's still within the 15 foot set back on the.

712
01:05:28,419 --> 01:05:30,480
of communal property.

713
01:05:31,141 --> 01:05:38,266
I think the disputed area, it's the space between the four stairs, right?

714
01:05:38,987 --> 01:05:40,748
And the city sidewalk.

715
01:05:41,468 --> 01:05:46,032
It's from the sidewalk to the front of the house.

716
01:05:46,352 --> 01:05:49,014
Oh, that from the sidewalk to the front of the house.

717
01:05:49,574 --> 01:05:49,934
Okay.

718
01:05:51,315 --> 01:05:57,740
But the fact that he's been there for 32 years, I think based on adverse possession, he owns that.

719
01:06:01,663 --> 01:06:05,965
Oh, yeah, no, Mary, he definitely he owns the his front yard.

720
01:06:06,305 --> 01:06:13,527
I think they he just thought he didn't have a setback issue because he thought he could measure from the from the curb on the street.

721
01:06:13,827 --> 01:06:17,369
But actually, he has to measure from the sidewalk to the front of his house.

722
01:06:17,709 --> 01:06:18,889
And so he needs a variance.

723
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:22,951
OK, does that make sense?

724
01:06:23,651 --> 01:06:23,851
Yeah.

725
01:06:25,792 --> 01:06:25,992
Thanks.

726
01:06:34,647 --> 01:06:36,308
Any other deliberation from the board?

727
01:06:36,428 --> 01:06:36,688
Go ahead.

728
01:06:37,309 --> 01:06:58,443
Yeah, so one other thing I think that's worth bringing up, and before we do anything like this, we should check with the applicant, but if the board were to grant a variance, we could do so with a condition kind of restricting the use of that space.

729
01:06:58,483 --> 01:07:00,985
So maybe, you know, variance,

730
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:07,251
conditional that it remain in open.

731
01:07:07,271 --> 01:07:13,472
Did the porch not be fully enclosed or something like that?

732
01:07:17,292 --> 01:07:18,112
There's downsides.

733
01:07:18,152 --> 01:07:28,114
I'm not necessarily advocating for that, but I just wanted to bring that up since it seems the board had some concerns about the future use of the space.

734
01:07:30,155 --> 01:07:32,815
That mean they couldn't put screens up?

735
01:07:34,359 --> 01:07:36,721
We'd have to be very careful in how we word it.

736
01:07:36,981 --> 01:07:41,245
I'm just pointing out that variances can be granted with conditions.

737
01:07:41,345 --> 01:07:45,408
And if someone was worried about that, that would be one avenue.

738
01:07:50,206 --> 01:07:56,210
Yeah, if I could, Mr. Chair, that is essentially what I was saying earlier.

739
01:07:57,691 --> 01:08:02,475
If we were to become living space, I would have a very different opinion of it.

740
01:08:04,196 --> 01:08:07,398
A porch seems like a great idea.

741
01:08:07,658 --> 01:08:10,140
So that's my opinion of that.

742
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:16,844
And it's not encroaching, I think, on, doesn't seem to be anyway, encroaching on

743
01:08:18,381 --> 01:08:25,665
the neighbors to the point where a detriment to their sightline or anything of that nature.

744
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:35,430
Thank you, Mike.

745
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:36,250
Thank you, Chris.

746
01:08:38,892 --> 01:08:39,932
Mary, did you have something else?

747
01:08:40,452 --> 01:08:41,733
Or is your hand still up?

748
01:08:54,894 --> 01:08:56,061
Any other items from the board?

749
01:08:58,893 --> 01:09:03,697
I'm just going to say that I'm not as worried now as when I was first thinking about this.

750
01:09:03,857 --> 01:09:13,505
I thought, Chris, your point about the other houses on Playstead Road and in looking at them, you're right.

751
01:09:13,545 --> 01:09:22,191
The porches and the steps come almost to the sidewalk, so I think I don't have any concerns.

752
01:09:22,612 --> 01:09:26,635
I wouldn't feel the need to put any restrictive language on it.

753
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:45,237
I would advise you that Chapter 48 in Article 3 explicitly does not allow zoning boards to regulate the interior of a structure.

754
01:09:46,673 --> 01:09:53,478
Um, any walls added to that would have to be considered part of the interior of the structure.

755
01:09:53,558 --> 01:10:00,023
So I don't think it would be advisable to try to put a condition on there to not allow enclosed walls.

756
01:10:00,124 --> 01:10:01,525
I think that's within their rights.

757
01:10:01,565 --> 01:10:02,866
Should they do that down the road?

758
01:10:07,769 --> 01:10:08,430
Thank you, Commissioner.

759
01:10:15,858 --> 01:10:23,261
So, from my perspective, again, I appreciate Dennis looking at the lot widths there.

760
01:10:24,982 --> 01:10:36,826
Now, the opportunity to build this type of structure around the other areas of the house, understanding that the applicant is looking for that position for the front yard, especially because it's on the park.

761
01:10:37,746 --> 01:10:43,569
There's no across the street of Butters, so there's nobody that's going to be looking at the house specifically,

762
01:10:46,085 --> 01:10:51,689
You know, it's not obstructing public way or anybody across the street.

763
01:10:52,690 --> 01:11:00,216
Again, also looking at place head to Chris and Andre's point, you know, those houses are definitely closer to the street.

764
01:11:01,057 --> 01:11:13,707
I can definitely see the hardship for the owner for the development of this anywhere else in the lot in comparison with their neighbors.

765
01:11:18,948 --> 01:11:20,489
Um, anyone else?

766
01:11:22,691 --> 01:11:26,293
Trailway to motion on 133 Century Street extension.

767
01:11:29,195 --> 01:11:33,718
Um, I'll motion to approve the variance for 1 33 Century Street extension.

768
01:11:37,241 --> 01:11:37,621
Thank you, Mike.

769
01:11:37,641 --> 01:11:38,241
Do we have a second?

770
01:11:38,862 --> 01:11:39,382
Seconded.

771
01:11:40,303 --> 01:11:40,903
Thank you, Andrew.

772
01:11:42,204 --> 01:11:42,885
Roll call vote.

773
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:43,465
Yvette?

774
01:11:44,506 --> 01:11:44,626
Aye.

775
01:11:45,947 --> 01:11:46,247
Christy?

776
01:11:46,267 --> 01:11:46,527
Yvette?

777
01:11:47,648 --> 01:11:47,728
Aye.

778
01:11:49,294 --> 01:11:49,894
Mary Lee.

779
01:11:49,914 --> 01:11:57,578
I'll come back around.

780
01:11:57,678 --> 01:11:58,298
Andre Leroux.

781
01:11:59,439 --> 01:11:59,559
Hi.

782
01:12:00,839 --> 01:12:01,439
Mike Calvera.

783
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:02,620
No.

784
01:12:05,501 --> 01:12:05,841
Mary.

785
01:12:05,861 --> 01:12:13,465
Sorry, I'm having problems with my zoom.

786
01:12:13,745 --> 01:12:16,126
So I'm going to say no.

787
01:12:18,255 --> 01:12:21,598
Okay, two votes no, three votes yes.

788
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:25,882
We do have an approval for the variance.

789
01:12:28,645 --> 01:12:31,167
Point of order, it's a four.

790
01:12:31,948 --> 01:12:33,309
Oh, four, you're right.

791
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:34,310
I apologize.

792
01:12:34,611 --> 01:12:35,091
Thank you, Mike.

793
01:12:36,653 --> 01:12:39,195
So three votes yes, two votes no.

794
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:42,298
The variance is not, I think it's four to one.

795
01:12:54,769 --> 01:12:57,111
I'm on mute.

796
01:12:57,131 --> 01:12:58,592
So the variance is not approved.

797
01:12:59,813 --> 01:13:01,335
Dennis, next steps on this one?

798
01:13:03,236 --> 01:13:15,327
I guess I'll write a decision and get it to the boys and I'll try to get that to them as quickly as possible so they can all get next steps.

799
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:25,511
All right, thank you, Dennis.

800
01:13:27,293 --> 01:13:33,160
That is all the items on the agenda for seconds.

801
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,604
Do you have any area technical difficulties?

802
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:54,706
Sorry about that.

803
01:13:54,746 --> 01:13:56,088
I was just having trouble with my computer.

804
01:13:56,128 --> 01:13:56,568
I'm back.

805
01:13:57,849 --> 01:13:59,250
So that is all of the pieces.

806
01:14:00,151 --> 01:14:03,293
Moving to administrative updates.

807
01:14:04,154 --> 01:14:05,455
We do have meeting minutes.

808
01:14:05,555 --> 01:14:08,357
Did everybody have an opportunity to review the meeting minutes for 627?

809
01:14:08,817 --> 01:14:09,318
Mike?

810
01:14:09,338 --> 01:14:17,924
Jamie, I had a chance to review them, and I found them to be in order.

811
01:14:19,665 --> 01:14:20,166
Thank you, Mike.

812
01:14:22,508 --> 01:14:23,148
Do we have a motion?

813
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:30,298
I will motion to approve the meeting minutes for the.

814
01:14:31,659 --> 01:14:33,481
June regular meeting of the.

815
01:14:34,321 --> 01:14:38,225
Thank you Mike do we have a 2nd.

816
01:14:43,489 --> 01:14:46,531
Thank you Mike.

817
01:14:47,672 --> 01:14:50,354
Mary I Andre.

818
01:14:50,374 --> 01:14:52,416
Hi, I.

819
01:15:00,215 --> 01:15:03,416
Dennis, that was the items I had on the agenda.

820
01:15:03,456 --> 01:15:06,456
Do we have any other items from an administrative perspective?

821
01:15:06,476 --> 01:15:14,118
The only other issue is for our next scheduled meeting would be August 29th, which is a few days before the Labor Day weekend.

822
01:15:14,298 --> 01:15:21,779
And so I just wanted to check on member availability for that date, because I haven't sent out notices or anything for that meeting.

823
01:15:21,859 --> 01:15:25,300
But I wanted to check on member availability for August 29th.

824
01:15:28,387 --> 01:15:29,488
Dennis, I'll be away.

825
01:15:29,748 --> 01:15:30,749
I won't be able to attend.

826
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:33,431
Thank you.

827
01:15:33,511 --> 01:15:34,252
I'll be working.

828
01:15:35,413 --> 01:15:37,355
We move in that weekend at the university.

829
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,997
So that's two blocks.

830
01:15:40,097 --> 01:15:42,439
So I will be available, I think.

831
01:15:45,661 --> 01:15:46,462
I'm available.

832
01:15:49,164 --> 01:15:50,285
I should be available as well.

833
01:15:52,627 --> 01:15:53,568
And I'm available.

834
01:15:56,878 --> 01:15:59,140
So we've got five, sorry, so we can go forward.

835
01:16:01,982 --> 01:16:02,782
I'll be available.

836
01:16:03,242 --> 01:16:09,146
Good.

837
01:16:09,206 --> 01:16:09,847
Building Commissioner.

838
01:16:11,796 --> 01:16:29,463
I did want to ask, and I see it briefly mentioned in the agenda post today, Chair, I had sent out an email a couple weeks ago talking about rules and regulations and possibly updating and rewriting your rules and regulations to reflect where we are these days.

839
01:16:29,563 --> 01:16:30,323
Had you received that?

840
01:16:30,343 --> 01:16:35,265
I don't know that I did.

841
01:16:36,767 --> 01:16:41,310
because some of the stuff that's in your current rules and regulations are starting to get a little bit dated.

842
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:45,733
We're not quite using things that way, and it might be a good time to consider doing that.

843
01:16:47,334 --> 01:16:50,917
I suggested so that you could avoid doing it with the whole board at once.

844
01:16:50,937 --> 01:17:05,167
If you're amenable to reviewing your rules and regulations, which I can send some copies over from other communities, you might want to appoint a subcommittee of two folks to sort of start hashing them out a little bit so you don't get into the need to have a quorum stuff.

845
01:17:07,466 --> 01:17:13,491
but in talking to KP law as well, they felt it's time to consider updating the rules and regulations.

846
01:17:14,512 --> 01:17:14,632
Yep.

847
01:17:14,652 --> 01:17:15,092
All right.

848
01:17:15,213 --> 01:17:15,653
I apologize.

849
01:17:15,713 --> 01:17:16,273
I do see that.

850
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:24,060
So I will send over some examples I have, and then you can decide how you want to go from there with that.

851
01:17:25,681 --> 01:17:26,302
That'd be perfect.

852
01:17:26,362 --> 01:17:26,522
Okay.

853
01:17:44,009 --> 01:17:46,890
I think we're at the end of the agenda, so I'll motion to adjourn.

854
01:17:49,871 --> 01:17:50,452
Second.

855
01:17:51,052 --> 01:17:51,312
Second.

856
01:17:52,712 --> 01:17:53,093
Roll call.

857
01:17:53,933 --> 01:17:54,153
Mike?

858
01:17:54,813 --> 01:17:54,973
Aye.

859
01:17:55,894 --> 01:17:56,194
Mary?

860
01:17:56,974 --> 01:17:57,134
Aye.

861
01:17:58,635 --> 01:17:58,975
Andre?

862
01:17:59,575 --> 01:17:59,815
Aye.

863
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:01,096
Jim?

864
01:18:02,276 --> 01:18:02,416
Aye.

865
01:18:03,456 --> 01:18:03,897
Thank you.

866
01:18:05,717 --> 01:18:06,858
That is the end of our meeting.

867
01:18:07,218 --> 01:18:10,339
Next scheduled meeting as discussed will be on August 29th at 6.30pm.

868
01:18:15,716 --> 01:18:17,390
Right, thanks folks.
