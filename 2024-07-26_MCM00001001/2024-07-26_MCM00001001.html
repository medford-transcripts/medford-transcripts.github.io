    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=42.961">We</a>  do not, no, correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=44.002">So</a>  I can just go straight to the 86 Suffolk Street, case number A-2024-17. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=50.823">Applicant</a>  and owner, Amy and Andrew Weber, to install an addition at 86 Suffolk Street within the front yard setback on Suffolk Street and the rear yard setback, which is not allowed for the City Measures Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, Table B, Table of Dimensional Requirements.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=69.698">Thank</a>  you, Dennis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=70.359">Thank</a>  you for seeing us tonight.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=73.581">Hey,</a>  Amy and Andrew. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=74.722">If</a>  you could just introduce yourself, name and addresses, and then go ahead with the presentation.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=83.308">Sure</a>  thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=83.908">So</a>  I'm Amy Weber at 86 Suffolk Street in Medford.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=88.69">And</a>  Andrew Weber, the same address.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=93.272">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=94.592">And</a>  do you want us to present in?</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=97.033">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=98.934">OK,</a>  perfect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=103.255">So</a>  we are <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=105.785">Oh,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=107.306">We're</a>  looking to put an addition on our home. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=111.207">It's</a>  about 264 square foot addition to the side and we're looking for appeal because we'll be continuing an existing nonconformity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=122.452">We're</a>  not making it any worse than currently is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=126.653">but</a>  looking to continue along the same property line. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=130.915">The</a>  lot that we live on is an oddly shaped lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=134.657">We</a>  actually have two front yards, so dealing with a variety of different setbacks, which really drives us to the specific direction that we're looking to go for this addition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=146.183">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=152.306">Do</a>  you have any materials that you want to show the plot plan <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=155.959">that</a>  you want to review?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=159.221">Sure,</a>  I'd be happy to walk through. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=168.108">So</a>  this is the plot plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=177.595">As</a>  you can see, we have the oddly shaped lot here where we're on a corner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=182.817">Our</a>  front is Suffolk Street, but we are also on Wyman Street, and Wyman is also considered a front yard setback for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=191.741">And</a>  so our existing dwelling in here today is obviously within the black. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=197.944">And</a>  then what we're looking to add on here, the proposed addition, would be within the red. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=202.767">And</a>  what this proposed addition will afford for our family is <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=209.95">an</a>  additional one and a half additional baths. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=213.653">So</a>  today we have only one bath for a family of four, which is interesting, especially as our toddlers are in potty training years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=222.98">But</a>  obviously will only continue to be a little bit of a hardship as they get older and into teenage years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=230.046">And</a>  then on top of that, I work from home full time, which is nice and allows me to be present for the children. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=238.073">But</a>  I don't have an office today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=240.255">You</a>  can probably see we're sitting here at the dining room table. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=244.96">When</a>  I work right now, I set up in our bedroom upstairs at a desk that we've turned into an office. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=252.987">because</a>  the kids are home after school and so obviously can't be at the dining room table for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=258.79">This</a>  proposed addition would allow us to add an office, add an additional bath and a half, as well as dedicated play space for the kids now, study space as they get older. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=270.257">The</a>  non-conforming, what we're looking for is along this line here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=275.86">It's</a>  tight, it's quite close, we know it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=280.362">It's</a>  a 9.3 foot setback, which is, I believe it's 5.6 feet from the current regulation is what it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=292.31">And</a>  what we're looking to do is extend and continue that existing nonconformity along here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=298.733">out</a>  an additional 13.9 feet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=301.134">And</a>  again, it's continuing the existing, not making any additional greater hardship. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=312.719">Anything</a>  I missed?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=314.405">No,</a>  I think the only thing I would add is you can see in the plot plan now, the existing is there is a kind of small mudroom off to the side that will be demolished. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=327.834">And</a>  kind of we are just extending the width of our house towards our detached garage on a single story for 12 feet, as Amy mentioned.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=342.968">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=344.068">Thank</a>  you both. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=345.609">Any</a>  questions from the board while we get this up? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=349.07">Or</a>  from the data that you've had to review? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=352.911">Bill,</a>  did you mention it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=353.851">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=355.492">I</a>  do want to ask a question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=357.753">I</a>  look at that front corner at 14.9 and ask why or should we consider a variance for that corner? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=368.382">down</a>  by the front yard on Suffolk Street there, or it's moving from 25.5 to 14.9, that would be a variance in that condition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=377.409">For</a>  the 15 feet, correct.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=383.975">This</a>  would be considered a variance as well?</p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=387.077">You're</a>  encroaching in the 15-foot setback? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=390.97">It's</a>  not an extension of an existing nonconforming, it's a new encroachment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=395.112">So</a>  the board would have to consider both a variance for the front and a special permit for the nonconformity extension alteration on the backside.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=409.618">Thank</a>  you, yes, that is correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=411.759">I'm</a>  realizing now that it would be, that would be an additional <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=421.808">Is</a>  that not right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=436.793">Is</a>  this not the right addition?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=441.654">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=442.454">I</a>  think this looks like it's widening the house as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=450.856">which</a>  is not correct, I'm not sure what we have up there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=455.558">Yeah,</a>  you're right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=456.238">We're</a>  staying on our current property line. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=461.94">We're</a>  not extending out forward here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=465.041">Apologies.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=465.601">Let</a>  me see if I can.</p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=466.901">You</a>  do show a proposed open porch there to some extent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=471.463">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=472.723">It's</a>  exempt, but only if it's less than one-third the width of the house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=476.284">I</a>  assume it's either structure or <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=480.63">non-exempt</a>  porch.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=488.956">OK,</a>  let me, can you pull, you have the plans there, but that's not on the, apologies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=498.402">I</a>  don't know why, do you have the, you don't have a different one?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=505.947">I</a>  don't believe so.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=508.048">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=509.486">I</a>  apologize, that shouldn't be going that way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=521.71">We</a>  had plans initially. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=525.171">We</a>  scaled the project back significantly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=528.392">Could</a>  that be the old plans?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=529.733">Potentially.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=530.653">We</a>  met in front of the historical commission last year, or a year and a half ago now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=538.022">with</a>  a kind of a larger edition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=542.605">This</a>  is a scaled back version. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=544.166">I</a>  think we've just gotten kind of, we're trying to find the, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=551.17">The</a>  discretion of the board, if they were to include a variance and grant that variance and you built lesser, you wouldn't necessarily need to come back to them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=563.258">So</a>  that's just something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=565.88">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=567.157">I</a>  apologize, I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=570.419">Right,</a>  because this is the current. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=571.62">Yeah,</a>  this is the current. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=573.101">So</a>  when you look at the current plans here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=577.084">It's</a>  it's not changing the front and it's it's continuing the extended. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=586.31">It's</a>  continuing the same and it's just a small little so apologies that that I shared was the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=595.924">previous</a>  one, and I pulled it from your agenda, so apologies, because I thought I must have gotten my files confused and wanted to share, but.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=607.612">That</a>  was the document that was submitted with the application.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=611.555">Yeah,</a>  so the wrong document then was submitted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=615.078">That</a>  is my error, and I apologize. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=617.059">We'll</a>  have to get the correct ones. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=623.791">but</a>  to answer the question or to bring up again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=627.433">So</a>  we have our existing front here and then we continue on the same line. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=633.677">So</a>  I don't have it within the plot though. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=636.978">So</a>  I'll need to get that and get the correct one for you all.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=652.34">Okay,</a>  so I guess we would have 2 options because all of the documents that are part of the application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=661.885">Are</a>  with the previous design, we can continue right now with the existing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=670.09">Documentation</a>  and that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=671.271">Front</a>  or. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=678.509">We</a>  can continue to the next meeting with the updated documents.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=682.232">Hey,</a>  Jamie, your audio is a little low. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=683.753">Can</a>  you see if you can boost it?</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=689.578">No,</a>  I just went red. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=690.919">It</a>  looked like I got disconnected. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=697.944">If</a>  the documents are changing, they would have to resubmit an application, Dennis?</p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=706.051">I</a>  don't think so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=708.55">If</a>  one of the documents is correct, you can make your decision predicated on that specific document and require, which does presume that it would be fully compliant, and they can submit it if you're comfortable doing that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=722.617">If</a>  you need to see the literal numbers of the setback change so it's no longer a variance, then you would have to continue and ask them to resubmit, correct the document.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=739.153">Do</a>  you have an updated plan Amy?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=744.037">We're</a>  searching for one frantically. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=750.762">I</a>  don't think it's likely that we'll be able to get one within the time frame.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=758.798">you</a>  know, probably if if the board is open to it, if we can take a cycle and make sure we have all of the exact appropriate documents, I apologize and represent at the next meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=768.844">Um,</a>  that, um, would likely make sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=772.005">We</a>  want to make sure you all have your information and feel good and confident in in what we're doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=777.308">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=779.79">Um,</a>  I mean, I'm comfortable with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=782.311">Um,</a>  and that gets us all the accurate documentation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=785.373">I</a>  just wanna ask the commissioner one question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=787.454">Um,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=788.46">Commissioner,</a>  you mentioned special permit for the extension instead of a variance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=795.245">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=796.426">I</a>  believe under section 94-5 for pre-existing nonconformities, anytime we extend or alter it, I believe it's a special permit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=803.33">It</a>  used to be a finding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=804.771">I</a>  think it's a special permit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=805.912">It</a>  would not be a variance because they have not encroached further. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=808.894">They're</a>  simply extending it as I see it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=813.438">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=815.005">Unless</a>  it creates the need for a new variance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=819.789">So</a>  basically, if it's an existing nonconformity and it's extended without creating an additional dimensional nonconformity, then it's just a special permit.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=836.223">So</a>  in that instance, we would still come back and represent with the request of a special permit instead of <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=844.432">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=845.353">In</a>  theory, if everything is corrected the way you've described it, you would need just a special permit for the extensure alteration on the rear. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=854.379">The</a>  variance up front issue becomes moot, and that's what would be reviewed.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=862.686">OK,</a>  perfect.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=864.347">Can</a>  I just sort of throw out something? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=866.989">If</a>  that's the case, could the board tonight vote on the special permit <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=873.624">or</a>  the rear yard, and if it turns out they don't need the variance for the front yard, they've got what they need. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=884.266">If</a>  they show us the changing plans and it's, you know, further than a foot away, it's longer than 15 feet away, moving forward, I think we can do that tonight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=894.228">I</a>  mean, I don't really. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=896.509">I'm</a>  comfortable.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=900.79">For</a>  the board, anybody have any concerns with that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=907.092">Okay,</a>  so what we will focus on is the special permit for the extension of the existing 9.3 foot setback. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=915.437">So,</a>  variants of 5.6 feet in their yard. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=921.501">And</a>  we will address the variants if necessary if. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=924.803">Or</a>  would that would that have to go to the building department or do we just continue? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=932.488">That</a>  and then.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=934.55">It</a>  was put in the notice like I actually had it in the notice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=936.991">So,</a>  in theory, we could just. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=940.374">Continue</a>  the variance until next month if needed, but if not needed, then we can just, you know, they could, they could withdraw their request for that.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=948.619">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=949.94">That</a>  works for me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=952.042">All</a>  right, so for the board, we are looking at only. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=957.145">The.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=960.888">So</a>  we're looking only at the extension of the existing rear yard setback that is 5.6 feet, and that is going to be a special permit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=974.975">So</a>  we're looking at any specific factors that may set forth socioeconomic communities, traffic flow, adequacy, compatibility, impacts the natural environment, <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=995.242">So,</a>  any questions to the applicant from the boards focused on the special. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1002.007">Okay,</a>  we are open for public comment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1018.257">Does</a>  anybody from the public want to speak on the topic of 86 Suffolk Street? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1027.642">You</a>  could raise your hand on Zoom, raise your hand on screen, or you can email Dennis at dmackdougal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1041.749">If</a>  you can put it in the chat, Dennis, thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1046.391">That's</a>  dmackdougal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1049.523">at</a>  medford-ma.gov. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1058.928">I</a>  don't see any hands raised. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1060.869">We'll</a>  give that a minute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1069.953">Dennis,</a>  do you have any emails? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1073.335">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1074.675">Do</a>  we have a motion to close? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1078.508">Thank</a>  you guys sorry I saw you shake your head. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1086.795">And</a>  I do need a motion to close public comment and mention deliberation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1092.5">Motion.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1095.382">Thank</a>  you Mary do we have a second?</p>

    <p>[Chris D'Aveta]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1152.458">I</a>  guess I have a question with regard to the two-story structure, and you're extending one story of it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1165.084">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1165.765">We're</a>  currently a two-story structure, and the addition will be just one story.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1170.628">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1177.834">Thank</a>  you, Chris. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1181.477">Any</a>  other discussion from the board?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1186.861">It</a>  just seems very straightforward to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1189.183">I</a>  think that it's <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1192.748">you</a>  know, meets the criteria, no negative impacts on the community.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1201.013">Thank</a>  you, Andre. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1205.957">Okay,</a>  definitely agree with Andre. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1208.318">It's</a>  an existing non-conformity and extension. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1212.261">It'll</a>  be an improvement to the property and it's not infringing in any way on anyone else's property or disturbing the community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1224.585">So</a>  chair awaits a motion on the 6. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1229.586">So</a>  the.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1231.367">Motion</a>  to approve the special permit for a 6 of it.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1235.948">Thank</a>  you all second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1239.349">Thank</a>  you Jim. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1241.19">Roll</a>  call Jim.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1254.278">Okay,</a>  thank you Amy and Andrew for the presentation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1258.142">You</a>  guys were approved for your special permit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1262.026">We</a>  will continue the conversation with regards to the variants. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1267.231">If</a>  you could submit the updated plot plan, if that's no longer an approachment on that front yard, then we do not need to meet on this next meeting.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1279.938">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1280.498">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1281.299">We</a>  appreciate it a lot.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1282.86">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1283.2">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1283.58">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1283.9">And</a>  just as a heads up, so I'll write the decision for you all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1288.963">So</a>  as soon as I find out, if it turns out you don't need it at all, I can just go right ahead and writing the decision for the special permit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1296.447">If</a>  it's not, then I'll just, instead of having to do two decisions, it will just be one decision next month after that case is needed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1302.151">But</a>  for right now, once we sort of get that sorted out, we can go right ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1306.053">Actually,</a>  I think Mike's going to answer the question I was just going to ask.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1309.095">Mike,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1310.601">I</a>  wish I was 100% confident, but I do have procedural questions and concerns. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1318.928">I</a>  don't think we can really close the hearing until this issue is resolved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1329.516">So</a>  we've voted on the special permit as part of the path <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1337.533">to</a>  granting all the relief, but I think we need to then continue this to the next hearing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1344.516">And</a>  then in the event that we get something in writing saying, here's the updated plans, no variants being requested anymore, then we could close it in the next hearing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1356.68">And</a>  then at that point, that would be when the earliest opportunity to draft the decision.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1362.322">I</a>  believe well, in that case, maybe what I'll do is I'll draft the decision with just a special permit and then if it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1369.124">Needs</a>  that we don't do it, then you'll get it right away. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1372.205">So</a>  there won't be any. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1372.925">It</a>  usually takes about a month for the month for these to get done anyway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1377.567">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1378.847">It'll</a>  just be your instead of having to wait next, it'll be ready to go right away so that you get that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1383.789">And</a>  then once you get the, once you actually get the permit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1386.429">It</a>  gets filed in the clerk's office. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1388.85">And</a>  then there's 20 days appeals period after that, and then once that appeals period is passed, you go to the clerk's office, get a letter from them saying it's not been appealed, then you can go get your building permit, so.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1399.918">Yeah,</a>  and we do have to vote on the continuance for the variance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1405.342">So</a>  I do need a motion with regards to the variance.</p>

    <p>[Mary Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1412.927">Motion.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1415.629">With</a>  the continuance.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1417.733">For</a>  8,000 so chair which motion to continue the variance for 86. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1424.137">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1432.381">86</a>  suffix 3 to the next scheduled meeting of the zoning board appeals. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1441.747">2nd.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mary Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1443.548">I</a>  need someone to move that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1447.15">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1448.613">Motion</a>  I motion that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1450.935">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1453.837">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1461.203">Hi,</a>  Mary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1464.906">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1465.867">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1466.027">Hi.</a> </p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1473.964">Thank</a>  you everybody so now we do have that we've got the formal continuance for the variance and we'll just need to address that at that meeting with an updated plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1484.009">So,</a>  that you can see that it's not 1 if it's no longer necessary.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1489.132">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1489.852">We'll</a>  make sure we have all the right documents by then. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1492.454">Appreciate</a>  your understanding.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1494.655">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1499.563">All</a>  right, Dennis, could you read the next case? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1502.064">133</a>  Century Street Extension, case number A-2024-18. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1508.085">Applicant</a>  and owner, Patrick and Jennifer LaRoy, to construct a porch at 133 Century Street Extension within the front yard setback, which is not allowed per the City of Medford zoning ordinance, Chapter 94, Table B, Table of Conventional Requirements.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1521.988">Thank</a>  you, Dennis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1522.728">Do</a>  we have a representative from the applicant?</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1528.212">I</a>  know, but I think they're having connectivity issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1565.286">Pat</a>  and Jen, I'm wondering, if you just want to call in and not do the video thing, I can help you out by putting your plans up here so people can see them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1573.688">If</a>  that would be easier, let me get the number for you to call. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1576.269">I</a>  don't know if that would work or not.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1625.887">Hello.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1630.328">Can</a>  you hear us? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1635.489">Can</a>  you hear us? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1637.41">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1638.89">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1639.831">Hi,</a>  thanks for having us.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1642.991">I'm</a>  John LaVoie over here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1645.652">Century</a>  Street Extension. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1654.407">As</a>  a couple of the plot plan, you can hear correct.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1663.897">Try</a>  turning your video off that might help. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1667.62">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1673.246">Okay,</a>  we turned the video off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1675.168">Can</a>  you hear us?</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1676.619">Yep,</a>  that sounds better. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1677.86">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1678.36">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1679.481">Thanks</a>  for having us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1681.443">Pat</a>  and Jen Lavoie, Century Street Extension. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1686.069">Right</a>  down here at Playstate Park. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1689.15">So</a>  we're not quite as prepared as the party before us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1692.792">We</a>  don't have documents to show you here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1697.894">But</a>  when we left the engineer's office a few weeks back, we drove straight to the office and dropped them off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1706.057">So</a>  I'm hoping you might have some documents there.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1708.738">I</a>  do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1708.998">I'll</a>  bring them up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1709.518">Hold</a>  on one second.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1716.639">So</a>  we are proposing to put a 21 by eight foot, eight foot deep, uh, porch on the front of our house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1727.768">Um,</a>  I think it would be great addition, um, be able to sit out and enjoy the park. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1736.756">Um,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1739.758">We</a>  really didn't know that we were encroaching the setbacks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1744.241">We</a>  thought we owned to the curb, but we found out that's not the case. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1751.946">And</a>  so we're encroaching the setback by two and a half feet, and we're hoping that the neighborhood will allow and your board will allow.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1770.11">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1773.213">Any</a>  questions from the board for the applicants? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1776.757">We've</a>  got an extension of a porch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1778.599">I</a>  believe the front yard setback ends up being three feet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1786.787">A</a>  variance for three feet on the front yard setback.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1799.638">Mike,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1801.539">Yeah,</a>  so I wanted to make sure I understood that comment correctly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1806.982">So</a>  it does look like there's a sidewalk on the street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1816.566">And</a>  so if I understood correctly, <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1823.93">you</a>  own the land all the way to the curb instead of to the sidewalk, then this wouldn't be an encroachment, but because some portion, I don't know if it's the sidewalk itself or some point before the curb is, um, you don't own that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1839.48">That's</a>  why you need the relief that I understand that correctly.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1843.063">Yes,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1844.664">Mike.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1845.184">Uh,</a>  we, uh, we live on a private way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1847.586">I</a>  don't know if that made a difference. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1849.267">We</a>  thought that we owned to the curb and, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1854.812">As</a>  it ends up, that's not the way the rules work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1859.555">You</a>  still have your, what is it, a 15-foot setback? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1863.737">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1865.338">But</a>  when our builder came down to the department to get a permit, something red flagged, and they thought that we should go before the Board of Appeals.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1881.767">Okay,</a>  got it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1885.278">The</a>  12.0 is from the front of the house to the sidewalk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1891.222">Is</a>  that right?</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1894.364">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1895.445">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1896.406">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1898.347">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1901.929">Oh,</a>  and another question while I'm at it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1904.291">So</a>  looks like the property has. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1908.35">two</a>  trees currently in proximity to where you're looking to build the porch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1914.354">So</a>  are you going to have to remove those trees as part of this project?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1923.199">We</a>  hope not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1924.06">I</a>  trimmed those trees back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1926.801">And</a>  I don't think that they're going to be an issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1935.067">They</a>  don't.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1953.008">I</a>  think we lost you there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1974.738">If</a>  you want to use the phone number to dial in and call into the Zoom, that should get a better connection.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1987.068">Guys,</a>  can you hear us?</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1989.089">Nope.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1989.389">Yeah,</a>  we got you back now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1991.03">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1992.711">So</a>  we were talking about the trees. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=1998.114">We</a>  did trim them back on the backside of the trees to the house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2003.056">So</a>  I don't think that that's going to make any problem with the deck. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2009.313">and</a>  they don't interfere with the sidewalk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2012.974">So</a>  I think we're gonna try to leave them as they are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2016.975">We</a>  may have to have them professionally trimmed, but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2031.398">Okay,</a>  go ahead, Mike.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2034.203">Yeah,</a>  a couple other questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2038.047">So</a>  have you had a chance to talk with your immediate neighbors about the project? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2044.153">And</a>  have they weighed in on it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2047.656">Yeah,</a>  we did speak with each one of our neighbors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2051.139">And</a>  you know what, let me take that back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2054.322">We</a>  only spoke with the two houses on the right and the two houses on the left. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2059.927">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2061.588">Right</a>  on my street, they all face the park as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2065.311">And</a>  I think they're all behind us 100%. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2068.132">They</a>  think it's great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2070.954">I</a>  mean, we're not gonna be blocking any of their sunlight or anything like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2075.077">And</a>  we explained it to them in detail. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2079.26">And</a>  from what I gathered from them, their feedback was all positive.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2086.797">OK,</a>  and then my last question, at least for now, it's a little hard for me to tell. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2093.301">I</a>  pulled up the property on Google Street View. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2097.544">Is</a>  the front of your house roughly in line with the fronts of the houses to the immediate left and right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2106.009">Or</a>  are you further forward? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2108.671">Or</a>  are you set further back? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2110.112">It's</a>  a little hard for me to tell.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2111.233">I</a>  think we're all in a row. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2113.134">I</a>  think we're all pretty much in a row, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2115.416">OK,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Mary Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2121.363">I</a>  have a question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2122.444">So</a>  the part of the land that you said doesn't belong to you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2127.348">Does</a>  that belong to the city?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2129.05">You</a>  know, Mary, that's a good question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2133.153">We</a>  always thought we owned to the curb, living on a private way, because we all we all have to put in our own sidewalks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2143.523">So</a>  we always thought that we owned to the curb, but <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2148.366">Again,</a>  when we came down for the permit, we were told that, no, that's not the case. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2155.533">We</a>  don't own to the street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2158.735">So</a>  that's why we got the refreshed plot plan down at Medford Engineering.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2168.504">Commissioner,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2170.756">Typically</a>  on a private way, they own what's called the fee in the way, which means they own either out to the center of the way, or they own out to the opposite edge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2182.483">All</a>  that confers upon them is the rights to use it and the responsibilities to maintain it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2187.506">Their</a>  actual property is behind it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2190.028">So</a>  while they're replacing the sidewalks, that's because they own the responsibility for fixing the pavement, fixing that, but that, <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2198.233">Fee</a>  in the way is not actual property ownership, and they cannot use it as a part of zoning setbacks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2204.297">So</a>  that's what's different. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2205.698">If</a>  that was a street by the city, then the city would own the sidewalks and replace the street and replace them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2211.642">But</a>  private ways are a funky setup with what they call the fee in the way.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2216.406">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2218.492">Yeah,</a>  we've always enjoyed, I actually have been living here since 1960. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2223.575">I</a>  grew up a few houses down and we've always enjoyed living here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2228.498">Kind</a>  of thought it was pretty neat living on a private way.</p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2233.521">Until</a>  the builder fixed the pavement comes.</p>

    <p>[Mary Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2235.883">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2238.865">And</a>  Pat, how long have you lived in that house? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2244.668">32</a>  years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2244.969">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2245.609">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2246.249">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2251.21">Thank</a>  you, Mary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2252.431">Anybody</a>  else from the board have any questions?</p>

    <p>[Chris D'Aveta]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2256.274">Yeah,</a>  Mr. Chair, if I could ask a question of the building commissioner, and it's just a technical definition of what is considered an open porch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2269.566">What</a>  do you, or what is considered by the building department an open porch?</p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2277.306">Your</a>  typical single layer level porch with handrails. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2282.67">It's</a>  a closed porch when you put a roof on it and you just screen it in for a three season room or you put walls in it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2290.896">So</a>  that's really the difference at that point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2294.158">So</a>  this will have no roof?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2296.42">Oh,</a>  yes, this will have a roof. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2301.344">It's</a>  a farmer's porch with a roof.</p>

    <p>[Chris D'Aveta]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2303.326">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2303.886">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2304.247">So</a>  it's open on all sides except for the house, obviously.</p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2308.63">It's</a>  a closed porch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2311.211">And</a>  if it were under a third of the length, we wouldn't consider it exempt from zoning like an open porch, which we typically view as your typical single level deck with handrails. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2323.039">So</a>  this is really much more of an addition, even though he doesn't necessarily put fully enclosing walls around it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2330.004">still</a>  viewed more as an addition.</p>

    <p>[Chris D'Aveta]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2332.185">So</a>  they can have supports, obviously, to keep up the roof, but that's not considered a closed porch.</p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2340.149">Well,</a>  it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2340.709">It's</a>  an addition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2341.99">It</a>  just doesn't happen to have fully formed walls, but it now it's now become something different than an open porch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2349.694">It's</a>  a subtle difference, but it does change the loading characteristics. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2353.856">It</a>  changes some of the code characteristics of it versus a standard deck.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2368.447">Thank</a>  you, Chris. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2369.088">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2369.369">Commissioner.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2370.691">Any</a>  questions? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2371.433">Any</a>  additional questions from the board?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2373.937">Just</a>  wondering, is there a, uh, any kind of a. Of an architectural rendering or something we can look at.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2390.961">Dennis,</a>  did we leave anything like that with you, Dennis?</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2396.643">I</a>  don't believe so, to be honest, because for this instance, because it was just dimensional, so I think that was probably all we just had was what I showed with the... Okay, could I describe it a little bit to you guys?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2413.45">So</a>  again, it's going to be 21 feet long.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2425.63">Pat,</a>  we just lost your audio again.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2429.018">You</a>  still hear me? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2431.745">Can</a>  you still hear me? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2432.687">You're</a>  back now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2433.922">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2435.143">Yeah,</a>  so it's going to be 21 feet long, it will not be centered on the front of the house, it's going to be a little bit off to the right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2442.808">It's</a>  going to be about two feet in from the from the far right hand side of the house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2448.932">So</a>  it's not going to be to the edge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2450.153">It's</a>  going to be about two feet in from the right hand side of the house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2453.675">And</a>  then maybe eight, the far end of the other the left hand side of the house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2461.6">and</a>  it's gonna be eight feet deep. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2462.84">It's</a>  gonna be held up by piers, concrete piers under the ground. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2470.823">And</a>  we're gonna have four posts holding up the architectural metal roof there, those nice roofs that everybody's using now, the black roofs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2486.669">It's</a>  gonna have some electrical outlets on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2491.549">with</a>  some lighting on the ceiling. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2495.552">And</a>  I think we're gonna be using some type of Aztec flooring. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2499.694">It's</a>  gonna be really nice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2501.355">We've</a>  got a great builder. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2504.137">He's</a>  done some great work in the neighborhood. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2508.2">We've</a>  used them on other projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2511.862">And</a>  that's about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2515.264">I</a>  can't say it again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2517.406">Yeah,</a>  that's it.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2527.668">Andrew,</a>  is that sufficient for what you were trying to say?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2535.351">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I guess that's what we can get right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2543.594">I</a>  thought it was going to be an open porch, so I'm just absorbing the fact that this has a roof and it's a little bigger than what I was anticipating.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2564.16">Mike,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2566.78">Yeah,</a>  so one of the things the board is going to have to assess as part of this application is whether owing to circumstances related to the soil conditions, shape, or topography of the land or structures, a literal enforcement of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2592.353">zoning</a>  ordinance would involve a hardship. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2595.255">And</a>  so I just want to make sure I understand the case there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2601.077">So</a>  you mentioned that the position of the house is such that there's not really anywhere else you could add a porch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2609.422">So</a>  is that where the hardship is stemming from? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2614.604">It's</a>  that either the porch would be too narrow or you'd have to move the house.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2624.882">Right,</a>  I mean, yes, in order to stay away from encroaching the boundaries, yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2635.245">To</a>  view the park, I mean, we're just about ready to retire and we thought it would be great to have a porch to sit out and take it all in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2649.73">We</a>  wanted to go forward with an eight foot porch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2656.092">We've</a>  been around the neighborhood and we've checked out what a six foot porch is and what a seven foot porch is and what an eight foot porch is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2665.782">And</a>  clearly an eight foot porch is comfortable.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2672.703">OK,</a>  and then so the other thing we need to establish as part of this is that these conditions don't generally affect the zoning district in which your house is located. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2687.195">So</a>  are your neighbors able to build a porch like this on their properties? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2695.802">And</a>  this is something unique to the position of your house <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2702.493">is</a>  preventing you from doing it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2708.041">Yeah,</a>  Mike, I'm sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2709.464">At</a>  the beginning, you were cut off a little bit.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2711.447">Oh,</a>  yeah, sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2712.688">I'll</a>  restate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2713.249">So</a>  essentially, I already mentioned the <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2719.025">we</a>  have to relate the relief to something about, in this case, I guess, the position of the structure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2727.109">But</a>  then the second part is that something can't generally affect the zoning district in which you're located. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2734.873">So</a>  I'd just like to better understand <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2739.767">Are</a>  your neighbors' houses positioned such that they could build similar sized covered porches in the front of their properties? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2750.434">Or</a>  are all the houses?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2752.916">No,</a>  we all face the park. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2757.299">And</a>  I think we all have approximately the same setbacks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2766.792">I</a>  wouldn't be surprised if some other people, this may prompt other people to put a porch on the front of their house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2775.338">I</a>  mean, I think it's a great street to have a porch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2777.58">I</a>  mean, the park is beautiful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2779.922">And</a>  right now I have to sit out on my brick stairs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2784.265">And</a>  I'd love to have a porch.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2787.468">OK,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2792.912">Thank</a>  you, Mike.</p>

    <p>[Mary Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2795.519">Hi,</a>  so I pull up the picture of the house on my computer and you're talking about the porch built between the first level and the second level and it's extending to the street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2809.169">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2809.75">I'm</a>  just, again, I'm just trying to understand.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2812.652">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2813.272">So</a>  if you look at the house with the Google search, you'll see that vestibule on the front of the house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2822.312">So</a>  obviously that vestibule will be demoed and it's going to be that same height.</p>

    <p>[Mary Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2837.555">I'm</a>  sorry, I can't hear you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2840.935">See</a>  the four steps lead up to the landing on Mary Lee?</p>

    <p>[Mary Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2844.996">Yes,</a>  I see the four steps.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2847.576">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2848.096">So</a>  that will be the level of the proposed deck. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2852.655">porch.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mary Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2855.836">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2858.357">So</a>  that's where that the porch will extend. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2862.859">I'm</a>  trying to figure out where it extends. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2865.16">It</a>  will extend towards the front of the street, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2867.801">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2869.342">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2869.762">It</a>  will be from the face of the house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2872.183">It</a>  will be eight feet off of the face of the house towards the sidewalk.</p>

    <p>[Mary Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2878.545">Towards</a>  the sidewalk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2879.306">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2879.826">And</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2881.517">And</a>  the part where you mentioned before that's not owned by you, which part is that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2891.304">Basically,</a>  from the sidewalk, from what I understand, that full sidewalk that we put in, in that little strip of grass right to the curb, I don't think we own it.</p>

    <p>[Mary Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2907.649">Oh,</a>  okay, okay, I see, I see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2910.632">So</a>  between the two plots, the two portions of grass, there is, that looks like a path. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2919.659">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2919.959">So</a>  the porch will not, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2924.343">So</a>  the porch will not affect that little path.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2929.987">Oh</a>  no, no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2930.988">And</a>  it won't, it won't affect the sidewalk either.</p>

    <p>[Mary Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2934.851">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2935.011">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2935.752">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2941.752">Thank</a>  you, Mary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2944.734">Any</a>  other questions from the board?</p>

    <p>[Chris D'Aveta]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2948.897">Yes,</a>  Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2951.839">To</a>  me, this sounds like something that would be great, not only for the applicant, but to encourage people to be out looking at the field. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2964.198">I've</a>  spent many an hour at that field with my kids over the years, and it's nice to have the neighbors involved and able to enjoy that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2973.142">So</a>  it seems like something that's honestly a no-brainer in some ways. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2981.286">My</a>  only concern, I guess, would be, does the open porch turn into a closed porch? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2989.531">turn</a>  into another room in the house eventually, which is what I think happens over the years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=2999.174">I</a>  can tell you from personal experience in my parents' house, that's exactly what happened. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3004.296">So</a>  I'm sure that if anyone were to enclose it, they'd have to then go back to the building department, get the proper permit, <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3018.777">for</a>  and possibly be sent back to us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3022.28">Hence</a>  my question earlier about the open porch versus closed porch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3026.763">Other</a>  than that, as the application sits before us, I think it's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3038.472">Thank</a>  you, Chris. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3040.653">The</a>  building commissioner, I guess, in a way, a follow-up, if you will. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3045.857">Mr.</a>  Commissioner, if you <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3047.922">could</a>  speak on people enclosing their porches eventually from an open porch to a closed porch to a room?</p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3056.659">It's</a>  certainly very common. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3059.697">I</a>  certainly know of homes that have done that and put another porch on it, closed that, and over time have encroached over space. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3067.719">They</a>  would come for a building permit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3069.559">I</a>  don't see that they would need to come back before the board because you've already granted them the dimensional spaces. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3077.501">They're</a>  just filling in the holes between.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3091.537">Thank</a>  you, Commissioner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3092.277">Thank</a>  you, Chris. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3095.139">Any</a>  other questions from the board for the afternoon? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3103.143">Looks</a>  like we're good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3104.524">I</a>  will open us up for public comment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3107.005">Is</a>  there anybody on the call that would like to speak with regards to 133 Century Street extension? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3119.792">Please</a>  raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3121.903">or</a>  email Dennis at dmcdougall at medford-ma.gov. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3126.687">I</a>  don't see any hands raised on Zoom. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3143.922">Dennis,</a>  do you have anything in email?</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3148.483">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3149.244">I</a>  need a motion to close public comment and open deliberation.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3182.33">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3183.89">Mary</a>  Lee.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3185.351">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3186.752">Andre</a>  Leroux. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3187.933">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3189.473">Mike</a>  Calderon. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3191.174">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3192.175">And</a>  Kustya Venna. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3194.056">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3195.917">Thank</a>  you guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3196.757">You</a>  guys will be taking the vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3199.319">We</a>  are in deliberation and again thank you Mike earlier again this is a variant so we're going to be looking at <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3205.917">Owing</a>  to the circumstances relating to soil conditions, shape, or topography of such land or structures, literal enforcement of provisions of the ordinance or bylaw would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner, and that relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of the ordinance or bylaw. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3229.685">And</a>  I think the, let me go to deliberation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3233.747">Does</a>  anybody want to start?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3246.468">I'm</a>  a little concerned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3250.972">I</a>  always get a little concerned when we kind of set a precedent for moving into the front yard, you know, building into the front yard, whether that's a parking space or anything else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3266.624">But</a>  I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3269.834">In</a>  this circumstance, I was looking at the other houses on the street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3275.981">Many</a>  of them have larger side yards where they can put porches. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3281.267">I</a>  think for this purpose and given the fact that it's facing a park, I think it's appropriate.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3295.585">Andre,</a>  just a clarifying question, because I didn't look at that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3299.967">Does</a>  it seem like the other properties have side yards where they could put covered porches?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3307.791">Yeah,</a>  there's at least a couple of houses within just a few houses that have covered side yard porches.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3317.356">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3327.598">Go</a>  ahead, Mike.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3329.618">Yeah,</a>  I can go next. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3330.999">So</a>  I'm very familiar with the street in the park. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3336.3">I</a>  think it sounds like a really nice project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3342.681">Where</a>  I'm hung up is it seems to me like not having the space for an eight-foot covered porch in the front yard <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3356.585">is</a>  an issue that generally affects that whole street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3362.488">And</a>  if indeed the hardship generally affects the zoning district, then that's the area where a project like this wouldn't maybe not meet the standard for a variance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3378.336">I</a>  don't see a detriment to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3382.341">public</a>  good, and it would be nice to have something in writing from the neighbors, but I'll, you know, it, it sounds like a perfectly reasonable project, but that's my current hang up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3396.231">I</a>  don't, I don't know if there's anything really unusual about this property that justifies the variance.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3412.319">Actually,</a>  I got a question about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3414.12">The</a>  way that I interpret it was that because other properties on the street have enough side yards, they could accommodate a covered porch on the side, but this property can't, which is the hardship.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3434.288">Through</a>  the chair, that was partly why I asked you the question, Andre, because I hadn't noticed that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3441.325">So</a>  I'm trying to take a look now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3443.146">It's</a>  a little hard for me to tell which specific houses you were referring to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3454.235">But</a>  I do see, yeah, I guess I see some houses where they have maybe a covered porch in the back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3464.282">But</a>  it looks like those are all conforming. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3468.945">So</a>  then, yeah, this house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3475.998">It</a>  has a deck in the back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3484.002">Yeah,</a>  so I think if the board were to find, Andre, that there's something about the position of the structures or the shape of the lot on this property that <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3501.006">prevents</a>  building a covered porch of this size anywhere where other properties nearby can or especially do have something similar in size and magnitude, that would be an angle to say that the relief doesn't generally affect the zoning district. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3523.7">But</a>  then I also think it would be perfectly reasonable to take the interpretation that <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3530.421">not</a>  having a covered porch in the front is the criteria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3537.242">It</a>  really just depends on how you want to interpret that part of the standard. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3543.204">I</a>  still am not a 100 percent sure I'm seeing the examples you're referring to about other properties with covered porches.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3554.046">Yeah,</a>  I would look at 151 and 107. 151.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3561.529">Okay,</a>  yeah, covered porch in the side yard there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3566.391">Looks</a>  probably non-conforming.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3569.213">I</a>  believe 119 also.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3573.155">119,</a>  that looks like a garage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3574.836">Oh,</a>  no, yeah, I see it, yep. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3576.016">And</a>  then 107. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3576.757">Yeah,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Yvette Velez]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3582.58">Well,</a>  I would even say the house next door at some point had, because it looks like their extension, their house has an extension on the left. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3592.546">And</a>  that could have been a porch at some point, but they haven't closed it now because of the way it's set up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3598.791">It</a>  looks like a three seasons space. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3603.896">And</a>  I see that also throughout the block, that those types of things exist, or they have that room, but then there's a porch on the second floor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3622.175">I</a>  also think the unique thing about this is that they live abutting a park. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3628.579">So</a>  it's, you know, when we talk about not detrimental to the community, you know, it's not encroaching on like public space or taking away park space. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3638.564">And</a>  I think we've heard from other folks in our group saying, you know, looking forward to having an audience, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3646.989">So</a>  I think that's like a community benefit too.</p>

    <p>[Chris D'Aveta]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3651.048">Yeah,</a>  if I may, if I may add another comment, Mr. chairman. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3656.955">Yeah,</a>  I think this is I you know it's kind of weird because if you look, literally across the street from the park. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3664.845">You</a>  see all these. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3667.105">older</a>  houses that have large porches and they're just a few feet away from the sidewalk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3673.335">So</a>  this just happened to be a development that happened, you know, probably of the same builder. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3683.087">you</a>  know, 80 years ago or however many years those houses were built. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3687.73">And</a>  the time, the style of the day didn't have porches. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3693.674">And</a>  so I don't really think we can assign zoning per se of the, you know, the area that we're talking about because <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3710.448">Like,</a>  you know, literally across the street from the park on the other side, there are these large sort of Victorian and turn-of-the-century houses all with front porches. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3723.872">It</a>  happens to be that these houses on the other side, which were developed later, somehow the style was to omit or, you know, not build the front porch for whatever reason. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3736.875">We</a>  don't really know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3741.902">As</a>  Yvette just said, my feeling is that it's obviously a benefit to the applicant, but it's a benefit, I think, to the community to have people participate more in the outdoor world. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3759.333">Being</a>  across from the park is one of those big benefits.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3766.618">Thank</a>  you, Chris. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3767.178">I</a>  just want to jump over to Dennis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3768.619">He's</a>  got his hand raised.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3771.015">This</a>  is more just because I was able to call up on our software here, and so I don't know if this will help, but it sort of gives some context. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3777.721">So</a>  133 is about 55 feet wide, and 139 next door is 65, 143 is 70 feet wide, and then 151 goes to about 60, and then going the other direction, <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3791.855">127</a>  is about a little bit the same, but 119 is I think 80 feet wide. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3795.397">So</a>  there's pretty big discrepancy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3797.519">Like</a>  these weren't evenly, like you look in the street behind them, all the lots are exactly the same. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3803.802">This</a>  street has many different widths all up and down it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3808.925">So</a>  I don't know if that, just because I mean, Mike, you were sort of talking about like the widths and things like that and trying to get context. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3815.449">And</a>  I figured that would sort of help just giving some numbers.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3817.991">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3818.391">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3819.312">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3822.053">Thank</a>  you, Dennis, very much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3824.994">Mary,</a>  go ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3835.117">Mary,</a>  you got your hand raised?</p>

    <p>[Mary Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3841.959">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3843.32">Yep,</a>  we can now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3844.442">Okay,</a>  so initially, I thought there was going to be an issue with the ownership of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3854.067">I</a>  think that small portion in front of the house, but I think that Pat indicated that he lived there for 32 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3864.193">So</a>  I think that eliminated the ownership issue based on adverse possession. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3873.113">And</a>  I think that is why this matter is before the board, right, because of that ownership of that strip of land. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3884.136">That's</a>  why he needed the variance.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3886.837">He</a>  needs the variance because the front yard setback to the private way, which is community owned, where they have the fee of access is a 15-yard setback.</p>

    <p>[Mary Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3903.281">So,</a>  so, so I think the fact that he's been there for over 32 years or 32 years that negates that issue.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3917.093">So,</a>  I think no, it's the same. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3918.814">It's</a>  the same situation as if it were city property. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3922.197">If</a>  it were the city street, it's still within the 15 foot set back on the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3928.419">of</a>  communal property.</p>

    <p>[Mary Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3931.141">I</a>  think the disputed area, it's the space between the four stairs, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3938.987">And</a>  the city sidewalk.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3941.468">It's</a>  from the sidewalk to the front of the house.</p>

    <p>[Mary Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3946.352">Oh,</a>  that from the sidewalk to the front of the house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3949.574">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3951.315">But</a>  the fact that he's been there for 32 years, I think based on adverse possession, he owns that.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3961.663">Oh,</a>  yeah, no, Mary, he definitely he owns the his front yard. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3966.305">I</a>  think they he just thought he didn't have a setback issue because he thought he could measure from the from the curb on the street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3973.827">But</a>  actually, he has to measure from the sidewalk to the front of his house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3977.709">And</a>  so he needs a variance.</p>

    <p>[Mary Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3981.63">OK,</a>  does that make sense? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3983.651">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3985.792">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3994.647">Any</a>  other deliberation from the board? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3996.428">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=3997.309">Yeah,</a>  so one other thing I think that's worth bringing up, and before we do anything like this, we should check with the applicant, but if the board were to grant a variance, we could do so with a condition kind of restricting the use of that space. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4018.483">So</a>  maybe, you know, variance, <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4023.51">conditional</a>  that it remain in open. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4027.271">Did</a>  the porch not be fully enclosed or something like that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4037.292">There's</a>  downsides. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4038.152">I'm</a>  not necessarily advocating for that, but I just wanted to bring that up since it seems the board had some concerns about the future use of the space.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4050.155">That</a>  mean they couldn't put screens up?</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4054.359">We'd</a>  have to be very careful in how we word it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4056.981">I'm</a>  just pointing out that variances can be granted with conditions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4061.345">And</a>  if someone was worried about that, that would be one avenue.</p>

    <p>[Chris D'Aveta]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4070.206">Yeah,</a>  if I could, Mr. Chair, that is essentially what I was saying earlier. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4077.691">If</a>  we were to become living space, I would have a very different opinion of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4084.196">A</a>  porch seems like a great idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4087.658">So</a>  that's my opinion of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4090.78">And</a>  it's not encroaching, I think, on, doesn't seem to be anyway, encroaching on <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4098.381">the</a>  neighbors to the point where a detriment to their sightline or anything of that nature.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4115.01">Thank</a>  you, Mike. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4115.77">Thank</a>  you, Chris. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4118.892">Mary,</a>  did you have something else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4120.452">Or</a>  is your hand still up? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4134.894">Any</a>  other items from the board?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4138.893">I'm</a>  just going to say that I'm not as worried now as when I was first thinking about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4143.857">I</a>  thought, Chris, your point about the other houses on Playstead Road and in looking at them, you're right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4153.545">The</a>  porches and the steps come almost to the sidewalk, so I think I don't have any concerns. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4162.612">I</a>  wouldn't feel the need to put any restrictive language on it.</p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4173.34">I</a>  would advise you that Chapter 48 in Article 3 explicitly does not allow zoning boards to regulate the interior of a structure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4186.673">Um,</a>  any walls added to that would have to be considered part of the interior of the structure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4193.558">So</a>  I don't think it would be advisable to try to put a condition on there to not allow enclosed walls. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4200.124">I</a>  think that's within their rights. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4201.565">Should</a>  they do that down the road?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4207.769">Thank</a>  you, Commissioner.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4215.858">So,</a>  from my perspective, again, I appreciate Dennis looking at the lot widths there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4224.982">Now,</a>  the opportunity to build this type of structure around the other areas of the house, understanding that the applicant is looking for that position for the front yard, especially because it's on the park. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4237.746">There's</a>  no across the street of Butters, so there's nobody that's going to be looking at the house specifically, <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4246.085">You</a>  know, it's not obstructing public way or anybody across the street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4252.69">Again,</a>  also looking at place head to Chris and Andre's point, you know, those houses are definitely closer to the street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4261.057">I</a>  can definitely see the hardship for the owner for the development of this anywhere else in the lot in comparison with their neighbors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4278.948">Um,</a>  anyone else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4282.691">Trailway</a>  to motion on 133 Century Street extension.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4289.195">Um,</a>  I'll motion to approve the variance for 1 33 Century Street extension.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4297.241">Thank</a>  you, Mike. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4297.641">Do</a>  we have a second? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4298.862">Seconded.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4300.303">Thank</a>  you, Andrew. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4302.204">Roll</a>  call vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4303.165">Yvette?</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4322.34">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4325.501">Mary.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mary Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4325.861">Sorry,</a>  I'm having problems with my zoom. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4333.745">So</a>  I'm going to say no.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4338.255">Okay,</a>  two votes no, three votes yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4343.74">We</a>  do have an approval for the variance.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4348.645">Point</a>  of order, it's a four.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4351.948">Oh,</a>  four, you're right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4353.83">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4354.611">Thank</a>  you, Mike. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4356.653">So</a>  three votes yes, two votes no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4359.856">The</a>  variance is not, I think it's four to one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4374.769">I'm</a>  on mute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4377.131">So</a>  the variance is not approved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4379.813">Dennis,</a>  next steps on this one?</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4383.236">I</a>  guess I'll write a decision and get it to the boys and I'll try to get that to them as quickly as possible so they can all get next steps.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4404.71">All</a>  right, thank you, Dennis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4407.293">That</a>  is all the items on the agenda for seconds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4413.52">Do</a>  you have any area technical difficulties? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4434.166">Sorry</a>  about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4434.746">I</a>  was just having trouble with my computer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4436.128">I'm</a>  back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4437.849">So</a>  that is all of the pieces. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4440.151">Moving</a>  to administrative updates. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4444.154">We</a>  do have meeting minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4445.555">Did</a>  everybody have an opportunity to review the meeting minutes for 627? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4448.817">Mike?</a> </p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4506.476">The</a>  only other issue is for our next scheduled meeting would be August 29th, which is a few days before the Labor Day weekend. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4514.298">And</a>  so I just wanted to check on member availability for that date, because I haven't sent out notices or anything for that meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4521.859">But</a>  I wanted to check on member availability for August 29th.</p>

    <p>[Mary Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4528.387">Dennis,</a>  I'll be away. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4529.748">I</a>  won't be able to attend.</p>

    <p>[Yvette Velez]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4531.59">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4533.511">I'll</a>  be working. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4535.413">We</a>  move in that weekend at the university.</p>

    <p>[Chris D'Aveta]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4537.855">So</a>  that's two blocks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4540.097">So</a>  I will be available, I think.</p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4545.661">I'm</a>  available.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4549.164">I</a>  should be available as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4552.627">And</a>  I'm available.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4556.878">So</a>  we've got five, sorry, so we can go forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4561.982">I'll</a>  be available.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4563.242">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4569.206">Building</a>  Commissioner.</p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4571.796">I</a>  did want to ask, and I see it briefly mentioned in the agenda post today, Chair, I had sent out an email a couple weeks ago talking about rules and regulations and possibly updating and rewriting your rules and regulations to reflect where we are these days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4589.563">Had</a>  you received that?</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4590.343">I</a>  don't know that I did.</p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4596.767">because</a>  some of the stuff that's in your current rules and regulations are starting to get a little bit dated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4601.39">We're</a>  not quite using things that way, and it might be a good time to consider doing that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4607.334">I</a>  suggested so that you could avoid doing it with the whole board at once. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4610.937">If</a>  you're amenable to reviewing your rules and regulations, which I can send some copies over from other communities, you might want to appoint a subcommittee of two folks to sort of start hashing them out a little bit so you don't get into the need to have a quorum stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4627.466">but</a>  in talking to KP law as well, they felt it's time to consider updating the rules and regulations.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4634.512">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4634.652">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4635.213">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4635.713">I</a>  do see that.</p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4638.675">So</a>  I will send over some examples I have, and then you can decide how you want to go from there with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4645.681">That'd</a>  be perfect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4646.362">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mike Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4664.009">I</a>  think we're at the end of the agenda, so I'll motion to adjourn.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4683.456">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4685.717">That</a>  is the end of our meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-07-25-24&start=4687.218">Next</a>  scheduled meeting as discussed will be on August 29th at 6.30pm.</p>
