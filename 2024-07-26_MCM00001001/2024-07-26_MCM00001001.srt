00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:01,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, everyone.

[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the July 25th meeting of the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals.

[SPEAKER_05]: and Jamie Thompson present.

15
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis, could you read the, I think we can, we don't have to read the open meeting language anymore, we can just go straight to it.

16
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:43,562
[SPEAKER_11]: We do not, no, correct.

17
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,322
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can just go straight to the 86 Suffolk Street, case number A-2024-17.

18
00:00:50,823 --> 00:01:03,133
[SPEAKER_11]: Applicant and owner, Amy and Andrew Weber, to install an addition at 86 Suffolk Street within the front yard setback on Suffolk Street and the rear yard setback, which is not allowed for the City Measures Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, Table B, Table of Dimensional Requirements.

19
00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:10,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Dennis.

20
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for seeing us tonight.

21
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:14,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Amy and Andrew.

22
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:20,347
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could just introduce yourself, name and addresses, and then go ahead with the presentation.

23
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:23,808
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure thing.

24
00:01:23,908 --> 00:01:27,970
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Amy Weber at 86 Suffolk Street in Medford.

25
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,951
[SPEAKER_15]: And Andrew Weber, the same address.

26
00:01:33,272 --> 00:01:33,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.

27
00:01:34,592 --> 00:01:36,233
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you want us to present in?

28
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:37,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

29
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:40,114
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, perfect.

30
00:01:43,255 --> 00:01:43,776
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are

31
00:01:45,785 --> 00:01:46,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you.

32
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:50,287
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking to put an addition on our home.

33
00:01:51,207 --> 00:02:01,851
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 264 square foot addition to the side and we're looking for appeal because we'll be continuing an existing nonconformity.

34
00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:05,853
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not making it any worse than currently is.

35
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:09,495
[SPEAKER_00]: but looking to continue along the same property line.

36
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:14,097
[SPEAKER_00]: The lot that we live on is an oddly shaped lot.

37
00:02:14,657 --> 00:02:26,163
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have two front yards, so dealing with a variety of different setbacks, which really drives us to the specific direction that we're looking to go for this addition.

38
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:32,186
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

39
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:35,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any materials that you want to show the plot plan

40
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:36,900
[SPEAKER_05]: that you want to review?

41
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:41,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, I'd be happy to walk through.

42
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:57,555
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the plot plan.

43
00:02:57,595 --> 00:03:01,839
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, we have the oddly shaped lot here where we're on a corner.

44
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:10,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Our front is Suffolk Street, but we are also on Wyman Street, and Wyman is also considered a front yard setback for us.

45
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:17,804
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our existing dwelling in here today is obviously within the black.

46
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:22,747
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we're looking to add on here, the proposed addition, would be within the red.

47
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:28,069
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this proposed addition will afford for our family is

48
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,393
[SPEAKER_00]: an additional one and a half additional baths.

49
00:03:33,653 --> 00:03:41,619
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we have only one bath for a family of four, which is interesting, especially as our toddlers are in potty training years.

50
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,765
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously will only continue to be a little bit of a hardship as they get older and into teenage years.

51
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:57,213
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of that, I work from home full time, which is nice and allows me to be present for the children.

52
00:03:58,073 --> 00:03:59,735
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't have an office today.

53
00:04:00,255 --> 00:04:03,018
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably see we're sitting here at the dining room table.

54
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:12,086
[SPEAKER_00]: When I work right now, I set up in our bedroom upstairs at a desk that we've turned into an office.

55
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:17,870
[SPEAKER_00]: because the kids are home after school and so obviously can't be at the dining room table for that.

56
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:29,236
[SPEAKER_00]: This proposed addition would allow us to add an office, add an additional bath and a half, as well as dedicated play space for the kids now, study space as they get older.

57
00:04:30,257 --> 00:04:34,179
[SPEAKER_00]: The non-conforming, what we're looking for is along this line here.

58
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,181
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tight, it's quite close, we know it is.

59
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:52,230
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 9.3 foot setback, which is, I believe it's 5.6 feet from the current regulation is what it is.

60
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,793
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're looking to do is extend and continue that existing nonconformity along here.

61
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:01,114
[SPEAKER_00]: out an additional 13.9 feet.

62
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:10,918
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's continuing the existing, not making any additional greater hardship.

63
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:13,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything I missed?

64
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:27,613
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I think the only thing I would add is you can see in the plot plan now, the existing is there is a kind of small mudroom off to the side that will be demolished.

65
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:37,860
[SPEAKER_15]: And kind of we are just extending the width of our house towards our detached garage on a single story for 12 feet, as Amy mentioned.

66
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:43,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

67
00:05:44,068 --> 00:05:44,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you both.

68
00:05:45,609 --> 00:05:48,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions from the board while we get this up?

69
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Or from the data that you've had to review?

70
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:53,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Bill, did you mention it?

71
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:54,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

72
00:05:55,492 --> 00:05:57,713
[SPEAKER_10]: I do want to ask a question.

73
00:05:57,753 --> 00:06:04,915
[SPEAKER_10]: I look at that front corner at 14.9 and ask why or should we consider a variance for that corner?

74
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:16,749
[SPEAKER_10]: down by the front yard on Suffolk Street there, or it's moving from 25.5 to 14.9, that would be a variance in that condition.

75
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:18,830
[SPEAKER_10]: For the 15 feet, correct.

76
00:06:23,975 --> 00:06:26,096
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be considered a variance as well?

77
00:06:27,077 --> 00:06:28,698
[SPEAKER_10]: You're encroaching in the 15-foot setback?

78
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,612
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not an extension of an existing nonconforming, it's a new encroachment.

79
00:06:35,112 --> 00:06:43,576
[SPEAKER_10]: So the board would have to consider both a variance for the front and a special permit for the nonconformity extension alteration on the backside.

80
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, yes, that is correct.

81
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:58,062
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm realizing now that it would be, that would be an additional

82
00:07:01,808 --> 00:07:04,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that not right?

83
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this not the right addition?

84
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:22,374
[SPEAKER_15]: I apologize.

85
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:27,236
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this looks like it's widening the house as well.

86
00:07:30,856 --> 00:07:33,497
[SPEAKER_15]: which is not correct, I'm not sure what we have up there.

87
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:36,198
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're right.

88
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:38,799
[SPEAKER_00]: We're staying on our current property line.

89
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,260
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not extending out forward here.

90
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:45,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Apologies.

91
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:46,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I can.

92
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:51,402
[SPEAKER_10]: You do show a proposed open porch there to some extent.

93
00:07:51,463 --> 00:07:51,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

94
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:56,104
[SPEAKER_10]: It's exempt, but only if it's less than one-third the width of the house.

95
00:07:56,284 --> 00:07:59,165
[SPEAKER_10]: I assume it's either structure or

96
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,951
[SPEAKER_10]: non-exempt porch.

97
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:18,382
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, let me, can you pull, you have the plans there, but that's not on the, apologies.

98
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:25,507
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why, do you have the, you don't have a different one?

99
00:08:25,947 --> 00:08:26,768
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't believe so.

100
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:28,169
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

101
00:08:29,486 --> 00:08:37,269
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize, that shouldn't be going that way.

102
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,151
[SPEAKER_00]: We had plans initially.

103
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:47,472
[SPEAKER_00]: We scaled the project back significantly.

104
00:08:48,392 --> 00:08:49,633
[SPEAKER_00]: Could that be the old plans?

105
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:50,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Potentially.

106
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:55,755
[SPEAKER_15]: We met in front of the historical commission last year, or a year and a half ago now.

107
00:08:58,022 --> 00:09:02,585
[SPEAKER_15]: with a kind of a larger edition.

108
00:09:02,605 --> 00:09:04,146
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a scaled back version.

109
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:11,150
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we've just gotten kind of, we're trying to find the, sorry.

110
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:23,178
[SPEAKER_10]: The discretion of the board, if they were to include a variance and grant that variance and you built lesser, you wouldn't necessarily need to come back to them.

111
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:24,258
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's just something.

112
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

113
00:09:27,157 --> 00:09:29,038
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize, I think.

114
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:31,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, because this is the current.

115
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is the current.

116
00:09:33,101 --> 00:09:37,064
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look at the current plans here.

117
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:44,088
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's not changing the front and it's it's continuing the extended.

118
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:53,374
[SPEAKER_00]: It's continuing the same and it's just a small little so apologies that that I shared was the.

119
00:09:55,924 --> 00:10:06,912
[SPEAKER_00]: previous one, and I pulled it from your agenda, so apologies, because I thought I must have gotten my files confused and wanted to share, but.

120
00:10:07,612 --> 00:10:10,014
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the document that was submitted with the application.

121
00:10:11,555 --> 00:10:15,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the wrong document then was submitted.

122
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:17,039
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my error, and I apologize.

123
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:21,322
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to get the correct ones.

124
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,813
[SPEAKER_00]: but to answer the question or to bring up again.

125
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:33,076
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our existing front here and then we continue on the same line.

126
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:36,918
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have it within the plot though.

127
00:10:36,978 --> 00:10:39,640
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll need to get that and get the correct one for you all.

128
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:59,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I guess we would have 2 options because all of the documents that are part of the application.

129
00:11:01,885 --> 00:11:10,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Are with the previous design, we can continue right now with the existing.

130
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Documentation and that.

131
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:11,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Front or.

132
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:21,491
[SPEAKER_05]: We can continue to the next meeting with the updated documents.

133
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:23,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Jamie, your audio is a little low.

134
00:11:23,753 --> 00:11:29,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you see if you can boost it?

135
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:30,839
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I just went red.

136
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:34,502
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like I got disconnected.

137
00:11:37,944 --> 00:11:41,427
[SPEAKER_05]: If the documents are changing, they would have to resubmit an application, Dennis?

138
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:46,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.

139
00:11:48,550 --> 00:12:02,497
[SPEAKER_10]: If one of the documents is correct, you can make your decision predicated on that specific document and require, which does presume that it would be fully compliant, and they can submit it if you're comfortable doing that.

140
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:12,421
[SPEAKER_10]: If you need to see the literal numbers of the setback change so it's no longer a variance, then you would have to continue and ask them to resubmit, correct the document.

141
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:21,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have an updated plan Amy?

142
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:26,599
[SPEAKER_15]: We're searching for one frantically.

143
00:12:30,762 --> 00:12:37,027
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it's likely that we'll be able to get one within the time frame.

144
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:48,063
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, probably if if the board is open to it, if we can take a cycle and make sure we have all of the exact appropriate documents, I apologize and represent at the next meeting.

145
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:51,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that, um, would likely make sense.

146
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:57,288
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure you all have your information and feel good and confident in in what we're doing.

147
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:57,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

148
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I mean, I'm comfortable with that.

149
00:13:02,311 --> 00:13:04,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and that gets us all the accurate documentation.

150
00:13:05,373 --> 00:13:07,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanna ask the commissioner one question.

151
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:07,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

152
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Commissioner, you mentioned special permit for the extension instead of a variance.

153
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:15,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that correct?

154
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:23,310
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe under section 94-5 for pre-existing nonconformities, anytime we extend or alter it, I believe it's a special permit.

155
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,751
[SPEAKER_10]: It used to be a finding.

156
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:25,892
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a special permit.

157
00:13:25,912 --> 00:13:28,854
[SPEAKER_10]: It would not be a variance because they have not encroached further.

158
00:13:28,894 --> 00:13:32,657
[SPEAKER_10]: They're simply extending it as I see it.

159
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:33,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

160
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:37,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless it creates the need for a new variance.

161
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:50,578
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically, if it's an existing nonconformity and it's extended without creating an additional dimensional nonconformity, then it's just a special permit.

162
00:13:56,223 --> 00:14:02,628
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that instance, we would still come back and represent with the request of a special permit instead of

163
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:04,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

164
00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:13,759
[SPEAKER_10]: In theory, if everything is corrected the way you've described it, you would need just a special permit for the extensure alteration on the rear.

165
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:19,944
[SPEAKER_10]: The variance up front issue becomes moot, and that's what would be reviewed.

166
00:14:22,686 --> 00:14:23,666
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, perfect.

167
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:26,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I just sort of throw out something?

168
00:14:26,989 --> 00:14:32,153
[SPEAKER_11]: If that's the case, could the board tonight vote on the special permit

169
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:42,286
[SPEAKER_11]: or the rear yard, and if it turns out they don't need the variance for the front yard, they've got what they need.

170
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:53,928
[SPEAKER_11]: If they show us the changing plans and it's, you know, further than a foot away, it's longer than 15 feet away, moving forward, I think we can do that tonight.

171
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:55,669
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't really.

172
00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:00,730
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm comfortable.

173
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,570
[SPEAKER_05]: For the board, anybody have any concerns with that?

174
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:15,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so what we will focus on is the special permit for the extension of the existing 9.3 foot setback.

175
00:15:15,437 --> 00:15:18,319
[SPEAKER_05]: So, variants of 5.6 feet in their yard.

176
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:24,603
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will address the variants if necessary if.

177
00:15:24,803 --> 00:15:31,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Or would that would that have to go to the building department or do we just continue?

178
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:33,509
[SPEAKER_05]: That and then.

179
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,951
[SPEAKER_11]: It was put in the notice like I actually had it in the notice.

180
00:15:36,991 --> 00:15:39,113
[SPEAKER_11]: So, in theory, we could just.

181
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:48,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Continue the variance until next month if needed, but if not needed, then we can just, you know, they could, they could withdraw their request for that.

182
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:49,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

183
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,521
[SPEAKER_05]: That works for me.

184
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:56,385
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so for the board, we are looking at only.

185
00:15:57,145 --> 00:15:57,325
[SPEAKER_05]: The.

186
00:16:00,888 --> 00:16:12,534
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking only at the extension of the existing rear yard setback that is 5.6 feet, and that is going to be a special permit.

187
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:29,342
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking at any specific factors that may set forth socioeconomic communities, traffic flow, adequacy, compatibility, impacts the natural environment,

188
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:41,687
[SPEAKER_05]: So, any questions to the applicant from the boards focused on the special.

189
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:57,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we are open for public comment.

190
00:16:58,257 --> 00:17:04,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody from the public want to speak on the topic of 86 Suffolk Street?

191
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:20,528
[SPEAKER_05]: You could raise your hand on Zoom, raise your hand on screen, or you can email Dennis at dmackdougal.

192
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:26,371
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can put it in the chat, Dennis, thank you.

193
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:27,552
[SPEAKER_05]: That's dmackdougal.

194
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:31,064
[SPEAKER_05]: at medford-ma.gov.

195
00:17:38,928 --> 00:17:40,248
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see any hands raised.

196
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:41,709
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll give that a minute.

197
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:51,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis, do you have any emails?

198
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:54,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

199
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:56,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have a motion to close?

200
00:17:58,508 --> 00:18:00,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys sorry I saw you shake your head.

201
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:10,118
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do need a motion to close public comment and mention deliberation.

202
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:12,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion.

203
00:18:15,382 --> 00:18:16,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Mary do we have a second?

204
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:18,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

205
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:21,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim?

206
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:25,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

207
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:27,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris?

208
00:18:31,738 --> 00:18:36,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I. I. Mary.

209
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:43,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Mary.

210
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:50,754
[SPEAKER_12]: I sorry.

211
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:53,096
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you and event.

212
00:18:54,037 --> 00:18:55,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I thank you.

213
00:18:56,647 --> 00:18:59,309
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we are in deliberation.

214
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:04,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody from the board that would like to make comments or have any feedback on this?

215
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:22,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I have a question with regard to the two-story structure, and you're extending one story of it.

216
00:19:25,084 --> 00:19:25,364
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

217
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:30,608
[SPEAKER_00]: We're currently a two-story structure, and the addition will be just one story.

218
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:34,711
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

219
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:38,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chris.

220
00:19:41,477 --> 00:19:43,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other discussion from the board?

221
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:48,602
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seems very straightforward to me.

222
00:19:49,183 --> 00:19:49,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it's

223
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:58,312
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, meets the criteria, no negative impacts on the community.

224
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:01,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Andre.

225
00:20:05,957 --> 00:20:08,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, definitely agree with Andre.

226
00:20:08,318 --> 00:20:11,360
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an existing non-conformity and extension.

227
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:19,085
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be an improvement to the property and it's not infringing in any way on anyone else's property or disturbing the community.

228
00:20:24,585 --> 00:20:28,306
[SPEAKER_05]: So chair awaits a motion on the 6.

229
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:30,007
[SPEAKER_05]: So the.

230
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:34,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve the special permit for a 6 of it.

231
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:37,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all second.

232
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:39,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Jim.

233
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call Jim.

234
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I. Chris.

235
00:20:46,191 --> 00:20:46,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

236
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:47,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Mary.

237
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:48,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I.

238
00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:58,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you Amy and Andrew for the presentation.

239
00:20:58,142 --> 00:21:00,644
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys were approved for your special permit.

240
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:06,370
[SPEAKER_05]: We will continue the conversation with regards to the variants.

241
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:15,279
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could submit the updated plot plan, if that's no longer an approachment on that front yard, then we do not need to meet on this next meeting.

242
00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:20,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.

243
00:21:20,498 --> 00:21:21,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

244
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:22,439
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate it a lot.

245
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

246
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,560
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.

247
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:23,880
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

248
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,903
[SPEAKER_11]: And just as a heads up, so I'll write the decision for you all.

249
00:21:28,963 --> 00:21:36,367
[SPEAKER_11]: So as soon as I find out, if it turns out you don't need it at all, I can just go right ahead and writing the decision for the special permit.

250
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:42,071
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's not, then I'll just, instead of having to do two decisions, it will just be one decision next month after that case is needed.

251
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:45,793
[SPEAKER_11]: But for right now, once we sort of get that sorted out, we can go right ahead.

252
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:49,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I think Mike's going to answer the question I was just going to ask.

253
00:21:49,095 --> 00:21:49,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike, go ahead.

254
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:58,908
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I was 100% confident, but I do have procedural questions and concerns.

255
00:21:58,928 --> 00:22:09,416
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we can really close the hearing until this issue is resolved.

256
00:22:09,516 --> 00:22:16,242
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've voted on the special permit as part of the path

257
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:23,715
[SPEAKER_09]: to granting all the relief, but I think we need to then continue this to the next hearing.

258
00:22:24,516 --> 00:22:36,580
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in the event that we get something in writing saying, here's the updated plans, no variants being requested anymore, then we could close it in the next hearing.

259
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:42,102
[SPEAKER_09]: And then at that point, that would be when the earliest opportunity to draft the decision.

260
00:22:42,322 --> 00:22:48,264
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe well, in that case, maybe what I'll do is I'll draft the decision with just a special permit and then if it.

261
00:22:49,124 --> 00:22:51,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Needs that we don't do it, then you'll get it right away.

262
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:52,845
[SPEAKER_11]: So there won't be any.

263
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:57,487
[SPEAKER_11]: It usually takes about a month for the month for these to get done anyway.

264
00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:57,787
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

265
00:22:58,847 --> 00:23:03,608
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll just be your instead of having to wait next, it'll be ready to go right away so that you get that.

266
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:05,729
[SPEAKER_11]: And then once you get the, once you actually get the permit.

267
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:07,750
[SPEAKER_11]: It gets filed in the clerk's office.

268
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:18,717
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's 20 days appeals period after that, and then once that appeals period is passed, you go to the clerk's office, get a letter from them saying it's not been appealed, then you can go get your building permit, so.

269
00:23:19,918 --> 00:23:25,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and we do have to vote on the continuance for the variance.

270
00:23:25,342 --> 00:23:28,004
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do need a motion with regards to the variance.

271
00:23:32,927 --> 00:23:33,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion.

272
00:23:35,629 --> 00:23:36,390
[SPEAKER_12]: With the continuance.

273
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:43,636
[SPEAKER_05]: For 8,000 so chair which motion to continue the variance for 86.

274
00:23:44,137 --> 00:23:51,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

275
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:57,044
[SPEAKER_05]: 86 suffix 3 to the next scheduled meeting of the zoning board appeals.

276
00:24:01,747 --> 00:24:01,867
[SPEAKER_05]: 2nd.

277
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:05,189
[SPEAKER_12]: I need someone to move that.

278
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:07,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh.

279
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,734
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion I motion that.

280
00:24:10,935 --> 00:24:12,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

281
00:24:13,837 --> 00:24:14,438
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

282
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:16,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris.

283
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:19,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

284
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:24,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Mary.

285
00:24:24,906 --> 00:24:25,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

286
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:25,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

287
00:24:26,027 --> 00:24:26,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

288
00:24:33,964 --> 00:24:42,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you everybody so now we do have that we've got the formal continuance for the variance and we'll just need to address that at that meeting with an updated plan.

289
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:46,771
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that you can see that it's not 1 if it's no longer necessary.

290
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:49,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

291
00:24:49,852 --> 00:24:51,793
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make sure we have all the right documents by then.

292
00:24:52,454 --> 00:24:53,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate your understanding.

293
00:24:54,655 --> 00:24:55,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

294
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:02,044
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Dennis, could you read the next case?

295
00:25:02,064 --> 00:25:07,285
[SPEAKER_11]: 133 Century Street Extension, case number A-2024-18.

296
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:18,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Applicant and owner, Patrick and Jennifer LaRoy, to construct a porch at 133 Century Street Extension within the front yard setback, which is not allowed per the City of Medford zoning ordinance, Chapter 94, Table B, Table of Conventional Requirements.

297
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:22,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dennis.

298
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:24,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have a representative from the applicant?

299
00:25:28,212 --> 00:25:33,063
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, but I think they're having connectivity issues.

300
00:26:05,286 --> 00:26:13,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Pat and Jen, I'm wondering, if you just want to call in and not do the video thing, I can help you out by putting your plans up here so people can see them.

301
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:16,189
[SPEAKER_11]: If that would be easier, let me get the number for you to call.

302
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:21,070
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if that would work or not.

303
00:27:05,887 --> 00:27:06,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello.

304
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:15,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear us?

305
00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:16,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear us?

306
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:17,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

307
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:19,451
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

308
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:22,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, thanks for having us.

309
00:27:22,991 --> 00:27:24,132
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm John LaVoie over here.

310
00:27:25,652 --> 00:27:26,712
[SPEAKER_13]: Century Street Extension.

311
00:27:34,407 --> 00:27:39,492
[SPEAKER_13]: As a couple of the plot plan, you can hear correct.

312
00:27:43,897 --> 00:27:46,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Try turning your video off that might help.

313
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

314
00:27:53,246 --> 00:27:55,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, we turned the video off.

315
00:27:55,168 --> 00:27:55,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear us?

316
00:27:56,619 --> 00:27:57,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, that sounds better.

317
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

318
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:58,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

319
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:00,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for having us.

320
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:04,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Pat and Jen Lavoie, Century Street Extension.

321
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:08,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Right down here at Playstate Park.

322
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,131
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're not quite as prepared as the party before us.

323
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:17,153
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have documents to show you here.

324
00:28:17,894 --> 00:28:25,376
[SPEAKER_14]: But when we left the engineer's office a few weeks back, we drove straight to the office and dropped them off.

325
00:28:26,057 --> 00:28:28,278
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm hoping you might have some documents there.

326
00:28:28,738 --> 00:28:28,978
[SPEAKER_11]: I do.

327
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:29,498
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll bring them up.

328
00:28:29,518 --> 00:28:30,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on one second.

329
00:28:36,639 --> 00:28:46,908
[SPEAKER_14]: So we are proposing to put a 21 by eight foot, eight foot deep, uh, porch on the front of our house.

330
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:55,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I think it would be great addition, um, be able to sit out and enjoy the park.

331
00:28:56,756 --> 00:28:56,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Um,

332
00:28:59,758 --> 00:29:04,101
[SPEAKER_14]: We really didn't know that we were encroaching the setbacks.

333
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:10,165
[SPEAKER_14]: We thought we owned to the curb, but we found out that's not the case.

334
00:29:11,946 --> 00:29:23,875
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we're encroaching the setback by two and a half feet, and we're hoping that the neighborhood will allow and your board will allow.

335
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

336
00:29:33,213 --> 00:29:35,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions from the board for the applicants?

337
00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:38,559
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got an extension of a porch.

338
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:43,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the front yard setback ends up being three feet.

339
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:49,250
[SPEAKER_05]: A variance for three feet on the front yard setback.

340
00:29:59,638 --> 00:30:00,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, go ahead.

341
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:06,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so I wanted to make sure I understood that comment correctly.

342
00:30:06,982 --> 00:30:16,446
[SPEAKER_09]: So it does look like there's a sidewalk on the street.

343
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:20,308
[SPEAKER_09]: And so if I understood correctly,

344
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:39,440
[SPEAKER_09]: you own the land all the way to the curb instead of to the sidewalk, then this wouldn't be an encroachment, but because some portion, I don't know if it's the sidewalk itself or some point before the curb is, um, you don't own that.

345
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,242
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why you need the relief that I understand that correctly.

346
00:30:43,063 --> 00:30:44,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, exactly.

347
00:30:44,664 --> 00:30:44,904
[SPEAKER_14]: Mike.

348
00:30:45,184 --> 00:30:47,566
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, we, uh, we live on a private way.

349
00:30:47,586 --> 00:30:49,207
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if that made a difference.

350
00:30:49,267 --> 00:30:52,669
[SPEAKER_14]: We thought that we owned to the curb and, um,

351
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:58,774
[SPEAKER_14]: As it ends up, that's not the way the rules work.

352
00:30:59,555 --> 00:31:03,457
[SPEAKER_14]: You still have your, what is it, a 15-foot setback?

353
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:04,498
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure.

354
00:31:05,338 --> 00:31:19,266
[SPEAKER_14]: But when our builder came down to the department to get a permit, something red flagged, and they thought that we should go before the Board of Appeals.

355
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:22,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, got it.

356
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:31,122
[SPEAKER_09]: The 12.0 is from the front of the house to the sidewalk.

357
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:31,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that right?

358
00:31:34,364 --> 00:31:34,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

359
00:31:35,445 --> 00:31:35,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

360
00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:36,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

361
00:31:38,347 --> 00:31:38,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

362
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:44,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and another question while I'm at it.

363
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:46,953
[SPEAKER_09]: So looks like the property has.

364
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:54,334
[SPEAKER_09]: two trees currently in proximity to where you're looking to build the porch.

365
00:31:54,354 --> 00:32:00,798
[SPEAKER_09]: So are you going to have to remove those trees as part of this project?

366
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:03,840
[SPEAKER_14]: We hope not.

367
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,781
[SPEAKER_14]: I trimmed those trees back.

368
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:12,145
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't think that they're going to be an issue.

369
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:15,627
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't.

370
00:32:33,008 --> 00:32:33,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we lost you there.

371
00:32:54,738 --> 00:33:01,981
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to use the phone number to dial in and call into the Zoom, that should get a better connection.

372
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,008
[SPEAKER_14]: Guys, can you hear us?

373
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:09,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

374
00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:10,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we got you back now.

375
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

376
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:14,552
[SPEAKER_14]: So we were talking about the trees.

377
00:33:18,114 --> 00:33:23,016
[SPEAKER_14]: We did trim them back on the backside of the trees to the house.

378
00:33:23,056 --> 00:33:26,918
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't think that that's going to make any problem with the deck.

379
00:33:29,313 --> 00:33:32,274
[SPEAKER_14]: and they don't interfere with the sidewalk.

380
00:33:32,974 --> 00:33:35,495
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think we're gonna try to leave them as they are.

381
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:46,797
[SPEAKER_14]: We may have to have them professionally trimmed, but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

382
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:53,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, go ahead, Mike.

383
00:33:54,203 --> 00:33:58,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, a couple other questions.

384
00:33:58,047 --> 00:34:04,072
[SPEAKER_09]: So have you had a chance to talk with your immediate neighbors about the project?

385
00:34:04,153 --> 00:34:06,555
[SPEAKER_09]: And have they weighed in on it?

386
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:10,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we did speak with each one of our neighbors.

387
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:13,922
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know what, let me take that back.

388
00:34:14,322 --> 00:34:18,947
[SPEAKER_14]: We only spoke with the two houses on the right and the two houses on the left.

389
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:20,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

390
00:34:21,588 --> 00:34:24,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Right on my street, they all face the park as well.

391
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:28,092
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think they're all behind us 100%.

392
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,774
[SPEAKER_14]: They think it's great.

393
00:34:30,954 --> 00:34:34,817
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we're not gonna be blocking any of their sunlight or anything like that.

394
00:34:35,077 --> 00:34:38,239
[SPEAKER_14]: And we explained it to them in detail.

395
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:44,063
[SPEAKER_14]: And from what I gathered from them, their feedback was all positive.

396
00:34:46,797 --> 00:34:52,881
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, and then my last question, at least for now, it's a little hard for me to tell.

397
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:56,803
[SPEAKER_09]: I pulled up the property on Google Street View.

398
00:34:57,544 --> 00:35:05,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the front of your house roughly in line with the fronts of the houses to the immediate left and right?

399
00:35:06,009 --> 00:35:08,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Or are you further forward?

400
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:09,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Or are you set further back?

401
00:35:10,112 --> 00:35:11,213
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little hard for me to tell.

402
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:12,634
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we're all in a row.

403
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:14,855
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we're all pretty much in a row, yeah.

404
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:16,056
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, thank you.

405
00:35:21,363 --> 00:35:22,244
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a question.

406
00:35:22,444 --> 00:35:27,008
[SPEAKER_12]: So the part of the land that you said doesn't belong to you?

407
00:35:27,348 --> 00:35:29,030
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that belong to the city?

408
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:32,793
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, Mary, that's a good question.

409
00:35:33,153 --> 00:35:41,421
[SPEAKER_14]: We always thought we owned to the curb, living on a private way, because we all we all have to put in our own sidewalks.

410
00:35:43,523 --> 00:35:47,006
[SPEAKER_14]: So we always thought that we owned to the curb, but

411
00:35:48,366 --> 00:35:55,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, when we came down for the permit, we were told that, no, that's not the case.

412
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:56,914
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't own to the street.

413
00:35:58,735 --> 00:36:05,502
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's why we got the refreshed plot plan down at Medford Engineering.

414
00:36:08,504 --> 00:36:09,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Commissioner, go ahead.

415
00:36:10,756 --> 00:36:21,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Typically on a private way, they own what's called the fee in the way, which means they own either out to the center of the way, or they own out to the opposite edge.

416
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:27,066
[SPEAKER_10]: All that confers upon them is the rights to use it and the responsibilities to maintain it.

417
00:36:27,506 --> 00:36:29,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Their actual property is behind it.

418
00:36:30,028 --> 00:36:37,553
[SPEAKER_10]: So while they're replacing the sidewalks, that's because they own the responsibility for fixing the pavement, fixing that, but that,

419
00:36:38,233 --> 00:36:43,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Fee in the way is not actual property ownership, and they cannot use it as a part of zoning setbacks.

420
00:36:44,297 --> 00:36:45,398
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what's different.

421
00:36:45,698 --> 00:36:51,242
[SPEAKER_10]: If that was a street by the city, then the city would own the sidewalks and replace the street and replace them.

422
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:55,585
[SPEAKER_10]: But private ways are a funky setup with what they call the fee in the way.

423
00:36:56,406 --> 00:36:56,666
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

424
00:36:58,492 --> 00:37:03,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we've always enjoyed, I actually have been living here since 1960.

425
00:37:03,575 --> 00:37:08,438
[SPEAKER_14]: I grew up a few houses down and we've always enjoyed living here.

426
00:37:08,498 --> 00:37:12,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of thought it was pretty neat living on a private way.

427
00:37:13,521 --> 00:37:15,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Until the builder fixed the pavement comes.

428
00:37:15,883 --> 00:37:16,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, right.

429
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:24,468
[SPEAKER_12]: And Pat, how long have you lived in that house?

430
00:37:24,668 --> 00:37:24,949
[SPEAKER_12]: 32 years.

431
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:25,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

432
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:26,169
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

433
00:37:26,249 --> 00:37:26,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

434
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mary.

435
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:34,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody else from the board have any questions?

436
00:37:36,274 --> 00:37:47,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Mr. Chair, if I could ask a question of the building commissioner, and it's just a technical definition of what is considered an open porch.

437
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:55,091
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you, or what is considered by the building department an open porch?

438
00:37:57,306 --> 00:38:02,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Your typical single layer level porch with handrails.

439
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:10,315
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a closed porch when you put a roof on it and you just screen it in for a three season room or you put walls in it.

440
00:38:10,896 --> 00:38:13,338
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's really the difference at that point.

441
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,299
[SPEAKER_10]: So this will have no roof?

442
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,381
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yes, this will have a roof.

443
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:22,845
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a farmer's porch with a roof.

444
00:38:23,326 --> 00:38:23,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

445
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:24,207
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

446
00:38:24,247 --> 00:38:28,349
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's open on all sides except for the house, obviously.

447
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,931
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a closed porch.

448
00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:42,339
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it were under a third of the length, we wouldn't consider it exempt from zoning like an open porch, which we typically view as your typical single level deck with handrails.

449
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:49,244
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is really much more of an addition, even though he doesn't necessarily put fully enclosing walls around it.

450
00:38:50,004 --> 00:38:51,485
[SPEAKER_10]: still viewed more as an addition.

451
00:38:52,185 --> 00:38:59,389
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can have supports, obviously, to keep up the roof, but that's not considered a closed porch.

452
00:39:00,149 --> 00:39:00,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it is.

453
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:01,490
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an addition.

454
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:08,073
[SPEAKER_10]: It just doesn't happen to have fully formed walls, but it now it's now become something different than an open porch.

455
00:39:09,694 --> 00:39:13,756
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a subtle difference, but it does change the loading characteristics.

456
00:39:13,856 --> 00:39:17,798
[SPEAKER_10]: It changes some of the code characteristics of it versus a standard deck.

457
00:39:28,447 --> 00:39:29,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chris.

458
00:39:29,088 --> 00:39:29,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

459
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:29,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Commissioner.

460
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:31,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions?

461
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:32,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Any additional questions from the board?

462
00:39:33,937 --> 00:39:40,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wondering, is there a, uh, any kind of a. Of an architectural rendering or something we can look at.

463
00:39:50,961 --> 00:39:55,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Dennis, did we leave anything like that with you, Dennis?

464
00:39:56,643 --> 00:40:12,730
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe so, to be honest, because for this instance, because it was just dimensional, so I think that was probably all we just had was what I showed with the... Okay, could I describe it a little bit to you guys?

465
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,511
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, it's going to be 21 feet long.

466
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Pat, we just lost your audio again.

467
00:40:29,018 --> 00:40:30,582
[SPEAKER_14]: You still hear me?

468
00:40:31,745 --> 00:40:32,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you still hear me?

469
00:40:32,687 --> 00:40:33,189
[SPEAKER_14]: You're back now.

470
00:40:33,922 --> 00:40:34,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

471
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:41,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so it's going to be 21 feet long, it will not be centered on the front of the house, it's going to be a little bit off to the right.

472
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:48,412
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be about two feet in from the from the far right hand side of the house.

473
00:40:48,932 --> 00:40:50,133
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not going to be to the edge.

474
00:40:50,153 --> 00:40:53,595
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be about two feet in from the right hand side of the house.

475
00:40:53,675 --> 00:41:00,360
[SPEAKER_14]: And then maybe eight, the far end of the other the left hand side of the house.

476
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,760
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's gonna be eight feet deep.

477
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:09,403
[SPEAKER_14]: It's gonna be held up by piers, concrete piers under the ground.

478
00:41:10,823 --> 00:41:23,968
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're gonna have four posts holding up the architectural metal roof there, those nice roofs that everybody's using now, the black roofs.

479
00:41:26,669 --> 00:41:29,490
[SPEAKER_14]: It's gonna have some electrical outlets on it.

480
00:41:31,549 --> 00:41:33,931
[SPEAKER_14]: with some lighting on the ceiling.

481
00:41:35,552 --> 00:41:38,514
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we're gonna be using some type of Aztec flooring.

482
00:41:39,694 --> 00:41:40,615
[SPEAKER_14]: It's gonna be really nice.

483
00:41:41,355 --> 00:41:42,436
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got a great builder.

484
00:41:44,137 --> 00:41:45,958
[SPEAKER_14]: He's done some great work in the neighborhood.

485
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,801
[SPEAKER_14]: We've used them on other projects.

486
00:41:51,862 --> 00:41:54,244
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's about it.

487
00:41:55,264 --> 00:41:56,545
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't say it again.

488
00:41:57,406 --> 00:41:58,126
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's it.

489
00:42:07,668 --> 00:42:10,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Andrew, is that sufficient for what you were trying to say?

490
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:20,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I guess that's what we can get right now.

491
00:42:23,594 --> 00:42:34,338
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was going to be an open porch, so I'm just absorbing the fact that this has a roof and it's a little bigger than what I was anticipating.

492
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, go ahead.

493
00:42:46,780 --> 00:43:11,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so one of the things the board is going to have to assess as part of this application is whether owing to circumstances related to the soil conditions, shape, or topography of the land or structures, a literal enforcement of the

494
00:43:12,353 --> 00:43:14,414
[SPEAKER_09]: zoning ordinance would involve a hardship.

495
00:43:15,255 --> 00:43:21,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I just want to make sure I understand the case there.

496
00:43:21,077 --> 00:43:29,342
[SPEAKER_09]: So you mentioned that the position of the house is such that there's not really anywhere else you could add a porch.

497
00:43:29,422 --> 00:43:34,444
[SPEAKER_09]: So is that where the hardship is stemming from?

498
00:43:34,604 --> 00:43:41,708
[SPEAKER_09]: It's that either the porch would be too narrow or you'd have to move the house.

499
00:43:44,882 --> 00:43:50,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, I mean, yes, in order to stay away from encroaching the boundaries, yes.

500
00:43:55,245 --> 00:44:05,509
[SPEAKER_14]: To view the park, I mean, we're just about ready to retire and we thought it would be great to have a porch to sit out and take it all in.

501
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:13,832
[SPEAKER_14]: We wanted to go forward with an eight foot porch.

502
00:44:16,092 --> 00:44:25,662
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been around the neighborhood and we've checked out what a six foot porch is and what a seven foot porch is and what an eight foot porch is.

503
00:44:25,782 --> 00:44:28,485
[SPEAKER_14]: And clearly an eight foot porch is comfortable.

504
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:47,075
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, and then so the other thing we need to establish as part of this is that these conditions don't generally affect the zoning district in which your house is located.

505
00:44:47,195 --> 00:44:55,742
[SPEAKER_09]: So are your neighbors able to build a porch like this on their properties?

506
00:44:55,802 --> 00:45:00,045
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is something unique to the position of your house

507
00:45:02,493 --> 00:45:03,675
[SPEAKER_09]: is preventing you from doing it?

508
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:08,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Mike, I'm sorry.

509
00:45:09,464 --> 00:45:11,166
[SPEAKER_14]: At the beginning, you were cut off a little bit.

510
00:45:11,447 --> 00:45:12,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, sorry.

511
00:45:12,688 --> 00:45:13,209
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll restate.

512
00:45:13,249 --> 00:45:16,875
[SPEAKER_09]: So essentially, I already mentioned the

513
00:45:19,025 --> 00:45:25,468
[SPEAKER_09]: we have to relate the relief to something about, in this case, I guess, the position of the structure.

514
00:45:27,109 --> 00:45:34,753
[SPEAKER_09]: But then the second part is that something can't generally affect the zoning district in which you're located.

515
00:45:34,873 --> 00:45:37,614
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd just like to better understand

516
00:45:39,767 --> 00:45:50,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Are your neighbors' houses positioned such that they could build similar sized covered porches in the front of their properties?

517
00:45:50,434 --> 00:45:51,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Or are all the houses?

518
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,738
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we all face the park.

519
00:45:57,299 --> 00:46:01,161
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we all have approximately the same setbacks.

520
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:15,278
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't be surprised if some other people, this may prompt other people to put a porch on the front of their house.

521
00:46:15,338 --> 00:46:17,500
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I think it's a great street to have a porch.

522
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,542
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the park is beautiful.

523
00:46:19,922 --> 00:46:22,824
[SPEAKER_14]: And right now I have to sit out on my brick stairs.

524
00:46:24,265 --> 00:46:25,686
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'd love to have a porch.

525
00:46:27,468 --> 00:46:28,248
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, thank you.

526
00:46:32,912 --> 00:46:33,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mike.

527
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:48,429
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, so I pull up the picture of the house on my computer and you're talking about the porch built between the first level and the second level and it's extending to the street.

528
00:46:49,169 --> 00:46:49,710
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that correct?

529
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,771
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just, again, I'm just trying to understand.

530
00:46:52,652 --> 00:46:52,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

531
00:46:53,272 --> 00:47:00,678
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you look at the house with the Google search, you'll see that vestibule on the front of the house.

532
00:47:02,312 --> 00:47:11,594
[SPEAKER_14]: So obviously that vestibule will be demoed and it's going to be that same height.

533
00:47:17,555 --> 00:47:18,755
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

534
00:47:20,935 --> 00:47:24,956
[SPEAKER_14]: See the four steps lead up to the landing on Mary Lee?

535
00:47:24,996 --> 00:47:26,696
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I see the four steps.

536
00:47:27,576 --> 00:47:27,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

537
00:47:28,096 --> 00:47:31,257
[SPEAKER_14]: So that will be the level of the proposed deck.

538
00:47:32,655 --> 00:47:33,015
[SPEAKER_14]: porch.

539
00:47:35,836 --> 00:47:38,237
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

540
00:47:38,357 --> 00:47:42,039
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's where that the porch will extend.

541
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:44,880
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to figure out where it extends.

542
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,461
[SPEAKER_12]: It will extend towards the front of the street, right?

543
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:48,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

544
00:47:49,342 --> 00:47:49,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

545
00:47:49,762 --> 00:47:51,542
[SPEAKER_14]: It will be from the face of the house.

546
00:47:52,183 --> 00:47:56,604
[SPEAKER_14]: It will be eight feet off of the face of the house towards the sidewalk.

547
00:47:58,545 --> 00:47:59,205
[SPEAKER_12]: Towards the sidewalk.

548
00:47:59,306 --> 00:47:59,586
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

549
00:47:59,826 --> 00:47:59,946
[SPEAKER_12]: And

550
00:48:01,517 --> 00:48:07,882
[SPEAKER_12]: And the part where you mentioned before that's not owned by you, which part is that?

551
00:48:11,304 --> 00:48:25,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, from the sidewalk, from what I understand, that full sidewalk that we put in, in that little strip of grass right to the curb, I don't think we own it.

552
00:48:27,649 --> 00:48:30,151
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay, okay, I see, I see.

553
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:37,997
[SPEAKER_12]: So between the two plots, the two portions of grass, there is, that looks like a path.

554
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:39,919
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

555
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:43,982
[SPEAKER_12]: So the porch will not, right?

556
00:48:44,343 --> 00:48:49,307
[SPEAKER_12]: So the porch will not affect that little path.

557
00:48:49,987 --> 00:48:50,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh no, no.

558
00:48:50,988 --> 00:48:52,969
[SPEAKER_14]: And it won't, it won't affect the sidewalk either.

559
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:54,991
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

560
00:48:55,011 --> 00:48:55,692
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

561
00:48:55,752 --> 00:48:56,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

562
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:04,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mary.

563
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:05,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions from the board?

564
00:49:08,897 --> 00:49:10,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Mr. Chairman.

565
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:22,808
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, this sounds like something that would be great, not only for the applicant, but to encourage people to be out looking at the field.

566
00:49:24,198 --> 00:49:33,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I've spent many an hour at that field with my kids over the years, and it's nice to have the neighbors involved and able to enjoy that.

567
00:49:33,142 --> 00:49:41,006
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like something that's honestly a no-brainer in some ways.

568
00:49:41,286 --> 00:49:47,989
[SPEAKER_02]: My only concern, I guess, would be, does the open porch turn into a closed porch?

569
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:59,134
[SPEAKER_02]: turn into another room in the house eventually, which is what I think happens over the years.

570
00:49:59,174 --> 00:50:03,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you from personal experience in my parents' house, that's exactly what happened.

571
00:50:04,296 --> 00:50:17,320
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure that if anyone were to enclose it, they'd have to then go back to the building department, get the proper permit,

572
00:50:18,777 --> 00:50:21,619
[SPEAKER_02]: for and possibly be sent back to us.

573
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Hence my question earlier about the open porch versus closed porch.

574
00:50:26,763 --> 00:50:36,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, as the application sits before us, I think it's fine.

575
00:50:38,472 --> 00:50:39,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Chris.

576
00:50:40,653 --> 00:50:44,756
[SPEAKER_02]: The building commissioner, I guess, in a way, a follow-up, if you will.

577
00:50:45,857 --> 00:50:46,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Commissioner, if you

578
00:50:47,922 --> 00:50:54,154
[SPEAKER_02]: could speak on people enclosing their porches eventually from an open porch to a closed porch to a room?

579
00:50:56,659 --> 00:50:58,142
[SPEAKER_10]: It's certainly very common.

580
00:50:59,697 --> 00:51:07,159
[SPEAKER_10]: I certainly know of homes that have done that and put another porch on it, closed that, and over time have encroached over space.

581
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:09,299
[SPEAKER_10]: They would come for a building permit.

582
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:16,561
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see that they would need to come back before the board because you've already granted them the dimensional spaces.

583
00:51:17,501 --> 00:51:19,482
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just filling in the holes between.

584
00:51:31,537 --> 00:51:32,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Commissioner.

585
00:51:32,277 --> 00:51:32,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chris.

586
00:51:35,139 --> 00:51:37,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions from the board for the afternoon?

587
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:44,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like we're good.

588
00:51:44,524 --> 00:51:46,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I will open us up for public comment.

589
00:51:47,005 --> 00:51:57,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anybody on the call that would like to speak with regards to 133 Century Street extension?

590
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:01,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Please raise your hand on Zoom.

591
00:52:01,903 --> 00:52:06,667
[SPEAKER_05]: or email Dennis at dmcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

592
00:52:06,687 --> 00:52:23,902
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see any hands raised on Zoom.

593
00:52:23,922 --> 00:52:25,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis, do you have anything in email?

594
00:52:26,645 --> 00:52:27,025
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not.

595
00:52:28,483 --> 00:52:28,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

596
00:52:29,244 --> 00:52:33,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I need a motion to close public comment and open deliberation.

597
00:52:37,831 --> 00:52:38,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion.

598
00:52:39,212 --> 00:52:39,512
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

599
00:52:39,792 --> 00:52:40,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

600
00:52:40,853 --> 00:52:41,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_05]: Go to Yvette Feliz.

604
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:02,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

605
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:04,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary Lee.

606
00:53:05,351 --> 00:53:05,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

607
00:53:06,752 --> 00:53:07,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre Leroux.

608
00:53:07,933 --> 00:53:08,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

609
00:53:09,473 --> 00:53:10,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike Calderon.

610
00:53:11,174 --> 00:53:11,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

611
00:53:12,175 --> 00:53:12,935
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kustya Venna.

612
00:53:14,056 --> 00:53:14,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

613
00:53:15,917 --> 00:53:16,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys.

614
00:53:16,757 --> 00:53:17,838
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys will be taking the vote.

615
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:25,062
[SPEAKER_05]: We are in deliberation and again thank you Mike earlier again this is a variant so we're going to be looking at

616
00:53:25,917 --> 00:53:48,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Owing to the circumstances relating to soil conditions, shape, or topography of such land or structures, literal enforcement of provisions of the ordinance or bylaw would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner, and that relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of the ordinance or bylaw.

617
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:52,986
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the, let me go to deliberation.

618
00:53:53,747 --> 00:53:54,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody want to start?

619
00:54:06,468 --> 00:54:10,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a little concerned.

620
00:54:10,972 --> 00:54:25,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I always get a little concerned when we kind of set a precedent for moving into the front yard, you know, building into the front yard, whether that's a parking space or anything else.

621
00:54:26,624 --> 00:54:27,665
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think.

622
00:54:29,834 --> 00:54:34,539
[SPEAKER_06]: In this circumstance, I was looking at the other houses on the street.

623
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:41,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Many of them have larger side yards where they can put porches.

624
00:54:41,267 --> 00:54:50,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for this purpose and given the fact that it's facing a park, I think it's appropriate.

625
00:54:55,585 --> 00:54:58,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre, just a clarifying question, because I didn't look at that.

626
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:03,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Does it seem like the other properties have side yards where they could put covered porches?

627
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:16,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's at least a couple of houses within just a few houses that have covered side yard porches.

628
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:17,456
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

629
00:55:27,598 --> 00:55:29,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Mike.

630
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:30,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can go next.

631
00:55:30,999 --> 00:55:35,459
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm very familiar with the street in the park.

632
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:40,020
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it sounds like a really nice project.

633
00:55:42,681 --> 00:55:55,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Where I'm hung up is it seems to me like not having the space for an eight-foot covered porch in the front yard

634
00:55:56,585 --> 00:56:00,347
[SPEAKER_09]: is an issue that generally affects that whole street.

635
00:56:02,488 --> 00:56:17,776
[SPEAKER_09]: And if indeed the hardship generally affects the zoning district, then that's the area where a project like this wouldn't maybe not meet the standard for a variance.

636
00:56:18,336 --> 00:56:21,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see a detriment to the

637
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:36,171
[SPEAKER_09]: public good, and it would be nice to have something in writing from the neighbors, but I'll, you know, it, it sounds like a perfectly reasonable project, but that's my current hang up.

638
00:56:36,231 --> 00:56:46,979
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't, I don't know if there's anything really unusual about this property that justifies the variance.

639
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:53,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I got a question about that.

640
00:56:54,120 --> 00:57:10,286
[SPEAKER_06]: The way that I interpret it was that because other properties on the street have enough side yards, they could accommodate a covered porch on the side, but this property can't, which is the hardship.

641
00:57:14,288 --> 00:57:20,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Through the chair, that was partly why I asked you the question, Andre, because I hadn't noticed that.

642
00:57:21,325 --> 00:57:23,126
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm trying to take a look now.

643
00:57:23,146 --> 00:57:34,094
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little hard for me to tell which specific houses you were referring to.

644
00:57:34,235 --> 00:57:42,721
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do see, yeah, I guess I see some houses where they have maybe a covered porch in the back.

645
00:57:44,282 --> 00:57:46,524
[SPEAKER_09]: But it looks like those are all conforming.

646
00:57:48,945 --> 00:57:50,126
[SPEAKER_09]: So then, yeah, this house.

647
00:57:55,998 --> 00:57:58,959
[SPEAKER_09]: It has a deck in the back.

648
00:58:04,002 --> 00:58:18,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so I think if the board were to find, Andre, that there's something about the position of the structures or the shape of the lot on this property that

649
00:58:21,006 --> 00:58:43,640
[SPEAKER_09]: prevents building a covered porch of this size anywhere where other properties nearby can or especially do have something similar in size and magnitude, that would be an angle to say that the relief doesn't generally affect the zoning district.

650
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:48,883
[SPEAKER_09]: But then I also think it would be perfectly reasonable to take the interpretation that

651
00:58:50,421 --> 00:58:56,862
[SPEAKER_09]: not having a covered porch in the front is the criteria.

652
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:02,904
[SPEAKER_09]: It really just depends on how you want to interpret that part of the standard.

653
00:59:03,204 --> 00:59:13,146
[SPEAKER_09]: I still am not a 100 percent sure I'm seeing the examples you're referring to about other properties with covered porches.

654
00:59:14,046 --> 00:59:14,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would look at 151 and 107. 151.

655
00:59:21,529 --> 00:59:24,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, yeah, covered porch in the side yard there.

656
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:28,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks probably non-conforming.

657
00:59:29,213 --> 00:59:33,135
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe 119 also.

658
00:59:33,155 --> 00:59:34,516
[SPEAKER_09]: 119, that looks like a garage.

659
00:59:34,836 --> 00:59:35,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, yeah, I see it, yep.

660
00:59:36,016 --> 00:59:36,457
[SPEAKER_09]: And then 107.

661
00:59:36,757 --> 00:59:39,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, okay.

662
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:50,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I would even say the house next door at some point had, because it looks like their extension, their house has an extension on the left.

663
00:59:52,546 --> 00:59:58,651
[SPEAKER_08]: And that could have been a porch at some point, but they haven't closed it now because of the way it's set up.

664
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:03,455
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like a three seasons space.

665
01:00:03,896 --> 01:00:15,205
[SPEAKER_08]: And I see that also throughout the block, that those types of things exist, or they have that room, but then there's a porch on the second floor.

666
01:00:22,175 --> 01:00:27,898
[SPEAKER_08]: I also think the unique thing about this is that they live abutting a park.

667
01:00:28,579 --> 01:00:37,524
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's, you know, when we talk about not detrimental to the community, you know, it's not encroaching on like public space or taking away park space.

668
01:00:38,564 --> 01:00:46,328
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we've heard from other folks in our group saying, you know, looking forward to having an audience, right?

669
01:00:46,989 --> 01:00:48,910
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's like a community benefit too.

670
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:56,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if I may, if I may add another comment, Mr. chairman.

671
01:00:56,955 --> 01:01:03,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think this is I you know it's kind of weird because if you look, literally across the street from the park.

672
01:01:04,845 --> 01:01:05,766
[SPEAKER_02]: You see all these.

673
01:01:07,105 --> 01:01:11,993
[SPEAKER_02]: older houses that have large porches and they're just a few feet away from the sidewalk.

674
01:01:13,335 --> 01:01:21,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So this just happened to be a development that happened, you know, probably of the same builder.

675
01:01:23,087 --> 01:01:26,769
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 80 years ago or however many years those houses were built.

676
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:33,374
[SPEAKER_02]: And the time, the style of the day didn't have porches.

677
01:01:33,674 --> 01:01:48,924
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't really think we can assign zoning per se of the, you know, the area that we're talking about because

678
01:01:50,448 --> 01:02:02,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, literally across the street from the park on the other side, there are these large sort of Victorian and turn-of-the-century houses all with front porches.

679
01:02:03,872 --> 01:02:16,835
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens to be that these houses on the other side, which were developed later, somehow the style was to omit or, you know, not build the front porch for whatever reason.

680
01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:17,575
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really know.

681
01:02:21,902 --> 01:02:38,252
[SPEAKER_02]: As Yvette just said, my feeling is that it's obviously a benefit to the applicant, but it's a benefit, I think, to the community to have people participate more in the outdoor world.

682
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:42,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Being across from the park is one of those big benefits.

683
01:02:46,618 --> 01:02:47,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chris.

684
01:02:47,178 --> 01:02:48,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to jump over to Dennis.

685
01:02:48,619 --> 01:02:49,540
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got his hand raised.

686
01:02:51,015 --> 01:02:57,701
[SPEAKER_11]: This is more just because I was able to call up on our software here, and so I don't know if this will help, but it sort of gives some context.

687
01:02:57,721 --> 01:03:03,526
[SPEAKER_11]: So 133 is about 55 feet wide, and 139 next door is 65, 143 is 70 feet wide, and then 151 goes to about 60, and then going the other direction,

688
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:15,337
[SPEAKER_11]: 127 is about a little bit the same, but 119 is I think 80 feet wide.

689
01:03:15,397 --> 01:03:17,319
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's pretty big discrepancy.

690
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:23,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Like these weren't evenly, like you look in the street behind them, all the lots are exactly the same.

691
01:03:23,802 --> 01:03:28,045
[SPEAKER_11]: This street has many different widths all up and down it.

692
01:03:28,925 --> 01:03:35,389
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know if that, just because I mean, Mike, you were sort of talking about like the widths and things like that and trying to get context.

693
01:03:35,449 --> 01:03:37,471
[SPEAKER_11]: And I figured that would sort of help just giving some numbers.

694
01:03:37,991 --> 01:03:38,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

695
01:03:38,391 --> 01:03:39,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

696
01:03:39,312 --> 01:03:39,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

697
01:03:42,053 --> 01:03:43,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dennis, very much.

698
01:03:44,994 --> 01:03:45,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary, go ahead.

699
01:03:55,117 --> 01:03:57,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary, you got your hand raised?

700
01:04:01,959 --> 01:04:02,519
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you hear me?

701
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:03,940
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, we can now.

702
01:04:04,442 --> 01:04:13,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so initially, I thought there was going to be an issue with the ownership of that.

703
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:23,292
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that small portion in front of the house, but I think that Pat indicated that he lived there for 32 years.

704
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:30,976
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that eliminated the ownership issue based on adverse possession.

705
01:04:33,113 --> 01:04:42,016
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that is why this matter is before the board, right, because of that ownership of that strip of land.

706
01:04:44,136 --> 01:04:45,517
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why he needed the variance.

707
01:04:46,837 --> 01:04:59,581
[SPEAKER_05]: He needs the variance because the front yard setback to the private way, which is community owned, where they have the fee of access is a 15-yard setback.

708
01:05:03,281 --> 01:05:12,889
[SPEAKER_12]: So, so, so I think the fact that he's been there for over 32 years or 32 years that negates that issue.

709
01:05:17,093 --> 01:05:18,694
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I think no, it's the same.

710
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:21,336
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same situation as if it were city property.

711
01:05:22,197 --> 01:05:26,621
[SPEAKER_05]: If it were the city street, it's still within the 15 foot set back on the.

712
01:05:28,419 --> 01:05:30,480
[SPEAKER_05]: of communal property.

713
01:05:31,141 --> 01:05:38,266
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the disputed area, it's the space between the four stairs, right?

714
01:05:38,987 --> 01:05:40,748
[SPEAKER_12]: And the city sidewalk.

715
01:05:41,468 --> 01:05:46,032
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from the sidewalk to the front of the house.

716
01:05:46,352 --> 01:05:49,014
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that from the sidewalk to the front of the house.

717
01:05:49,574 --> 01:05:49,934
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

718
01:05:51,315 --> 01:05:57,740
[SPEAKER_12]: But the fact that he's been there for 32 years, I think based on adverse possession, he owns that.

719
01:06:01,663 --> 01:06:05,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, no, Mary, he definitely he owns the his front yard.

720
01:06:06,305 --> 01:06:13,527
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they he just thought he didn't have a setback issue because he thought he could measure from the from the curb on the street.

721
01:06:13,827 --> 01:06:17,369
[SPEAKER_06]: But actually, he has to measure from the sidewalk to the front of his house.

722
01:06:17,709 --> 01:06:18,889
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he needs a variance.

723
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:22,951
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, does that make sense?

724
01:06:23,651 --> 01:06:23,851
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

725
01:06:25,792 --> 01:06:25,992
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

726
01:06:34,647 --> 01:06:36,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other deliberation from the board?

727
01:06:36,428 --> 01:06:36,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

728
01:06:37,309 --> 01:06:58,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so one other thing I think that's worth bringing up, and before we do anything like this, we should check with the applicant, but if the board were to grant a variance, we could do so with a condition kind of restricting the use of that space.

729
01:06:58,483 --> 01:07:00,985
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe, you know, variance,

730
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:07,251
[SPEAKER_09]: conditional that it remain in open.

731
01:07:07,271 --> 01:07:13,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Did the porch not be fully enclosed or something like that?

732
01:07:17,292 --> 01:07:18,112
[SPEAKER_09]: There's downsides.

733
01:07:18,152 --> 01:07:28,114
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not necessarily advocating for that, but I just wanted to bring that up since it seems the board had some concerns about the future use of the space.

734
01:07:30,155 --> 01:07:32,815
[SPEAKER_01]: That mean they couldn't put screens up?

735
01:07:34,359 --> 01:07:36,721
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd have to be very careful in how we word it.

736
01:07:36,981 --> 01:07:41,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just pointing out that variances can be granted with conditions.

737
01:07:41,345 --> 01:07:45,408
[SPEAKER_09]: And if someone was worried about that, that would be one avenue.

738
01:07:50,206 --> 01:07:56,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if I could, Mr. Chair, that is essentially what I was saying earlier.

739
01:07:57,691 --> 01:08:02,475
[SPEAKER_02]: If we were to become living space, I would have a very different opinion of it.

740
01:08:04,196 --> 01:08:07,398
[SPEAKER_02]: A porch seems like a great idea.

741
01:08:07,658 --> 01:08:10,140
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my opinion of that.

742
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:16,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not encroaching, I think, on, doesn't seem to be anyway, encroaching on

743
01:08:18,381 --> 01:08:25,665
[SPEAKER_02]: the neighbors to the point where a detriment to their sightline or anything of that nature.

744
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:35,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mike.

745
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:36,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chris.

746
01:08:38,892 --> 01:08:39,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary, did you have something else?

747
01:08:40,452 --> 01:08:41,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is your hand still up?

748
01:08:54,894 --> 01:08:56,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other items from the board?

749
01:08:58,893 --> 01:09:03,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to say that I'm not as worried now as when I was first thinking about this.

750
01:09:03,857 --> 01:09:13,505
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought, Chris, your point about the other houses on Playstead Road and in looking at them, you're right.

751
01:09:13,545 --> 01:09:22,191
[SPEAKER_06]: The porches and the steps come almost to the sidewalk, so I think I don't have any concerns.

752
01:09:22,612 --> 01:09:26,635
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't feel the need to put any restrictive language on it.

753
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:45,237
[SPEAKER_10]: I would advise you that Chapter 48 in Article 3 explicitly does not allow zoning boards to regulate the interior of a structure.

754
01:09:46,673 --> 01:09:53,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, any walls added to that would have to be considered part of the interior of the structure.

755
01:09:53,558 --> 01:10:00,023
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't think it would be advisable to try to put a condition on there to not allow enclosed walls.

756
01:10:00,124 --> 01:10:01,525
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's within their rights.

757
01:10:01,565 --> 01:10:02,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Should they do that down the road?

758
01:10:07,769 --> 01:10:08,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Commissioner.

759
01:10:15,858 --> 01:10:23,261
[SPEAKER_05]: So, from my perspective, again, I appreciate Dennis looking at the lot widths there.

760
01:10:24,982 --> 01:10:36,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the opportunity to build this type of structure around the other areas of the house, understanding that the applicant is looking for that position for the front yard, especially because it's on the park.

761
01:10:37,746 --> 01:10:43,569
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no across the street of Butters, so there's nobody that's going to be looking at the house specifically,

762
01:10:46,085 --> 01:10:51,689
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's not obstructing public way or anybody across the street.

763
01:10:52,690 --> 01:11:00,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, also looking at place head to Chris and Andre's point, you know, those houses are definitely closer to the street.

764
01:11:01,057 --> 01:11:13,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I can definitely see the hardship for the owner for the development of this anywhere else in the lot in comparison with their neighbors.

765
01:11:18,948 --> 01:11:20,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, anyone else?

766
01:11:22,691 --> 01:11:26,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Trailway to motion on 133 Century Street extension.

767
01:11:29,195 --> 01:11:33,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I'll motion to approve the variance for 1 33 Century Street extension.

768
01:11:37,241 --> 01:11:37,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mike.

769
01:11:37,641 --> 01:11:38,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have a second?

770
01:11:38,862 --> 01:11:39,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded.

771
01:11:40,303 --> 01:11:40,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Andrew.

772
01:11:42,204 --> 01:11:42,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote.

773
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:43,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Yvette?

774
01:11:44,506 --> 01:11:44,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

775
01:11:45,947 --> 01:11:46,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Christy?

776
01:11:46,267 --> 01:11:46,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Yvette?

777
01:11:47,648 --> 01:11:47,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

778
01:11:49,294 --> 01:11:49,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary Lee.

779
01:11:49,914 --> 01:11:57,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll come back around.

780
01:11:57,678 --> 01:11:58,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre Leroux.

781
01:11:59,439 --> 01:11:59,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

782
01:12:00,839 --> 01:12:01,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike Calvera.

783
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:02,620
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

784
01:12:05,501 --> 01:12:05,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Mary.

785
01:12:05,861 --> 01:12:13,465
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I'm having problems with my zoom.

786
01:12:13,745 --> 01:12:16,126
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm going to say no.

787
01:12:18,255 --> 01:12:21,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, two votes no, three votes yes.

788
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:25,882
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have an approval for the variance.

789
01:12:28,645 --> 01:12:31,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of order, it's a four.

790
01:12:31,948 --> 01:12:33,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, four, you're right.

791
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:34,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.

792
01:12:34,611 --> 01:12:35,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mike.

793
01:12:36,653 --> 01:12:39,195
[SPEAKER_05]: So three votes yes, two votes no.

794
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:42,298
[SPEAKER_05]: The variance is not, I think it's four to one.

795
01:12:54,769 --> 01:12:57,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on mute.

796
01:12:57,131 --> 01:12:58,592
[SPEAKER_05]: So the variance is not approved.

797
01:12:59,813 --> 01:13:01,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis, next steps on this one?

798
01:13:03,236 --> 01:13:15,327
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I'll write a decision and get it to the boys and I'll try to get that to them as quickly as possible so they can all get next steps.

799
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:25,511
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thank you, Dennis.

800
01:13:27,293 --> 01:13:33,160
[SPEAKER_05]: That is all the items on the agenda for seconds.

801
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any area technical difficulties?

802
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:54,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.

803
01:13:54,746 --> 01:13:56,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just having trouble with my computer.

804
01:13:56,128 --> 01:13:56,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm back.

805
01:13:57,849 --> 01:13:59,250
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is all of the pieces.

806
01:14:00,151 --> 01:14:03,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving to administrative updates.

807
01:14:04,154 --> 01:14:05,455
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have meeting minutes.

808
01:14:05,555 --> 01:14:08,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Did everybody have an opportunity to review the meeting minutes for 627?

809
01:14:08,817 --> 01:14:09,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike?

810
01:14:09,338 --> 01:14:17,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, I had a chance to review them, and I found them to be in order.

811
01:14:19,665 --> 01:14:20,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mike.

812
01:14:22,508 --> 01:14:23,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a motion?

813
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:30,298
[SPEAKER_09]: I will motion to approve the meeting minutes for the.

814
01:14:31,659 --> 01:14:33,481
[SPEAKER_09]: June regular meeting of the.

815
01:14:34,321 --> 01:14:38,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Mike do we have a 2nd.

816
01:14:43,489 --> 01:14:46,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Mike.

817
01:14:47,672 --> 01:14:50,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Mary I Andre.

818
01:14:50,374 --> 01:14:52,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I.

819
01:15:00,215 --> 01:15:03,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis, that was the items I had on the agenda.

820
01:15:03,456 --> 01:15:06,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any other items from an administrative perspective?

821
01:15:06,476 --> 01:15:14,118
[SPEAKER_11]: The only other issue is for our next scheduled meeting would be August 29th, which is a few days before the Labor Day weekend.

822
01:15:14,298 --> 01:15:21,779
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I just wanted to check on member availability for that date, because I haven't sent out notices or anything for that meeting.

823
01:15:21,859 --> 01:15:25,300
[SPEAKER_11]: But I wanted to check on member availability for August 29th.

824
01:15:28,387 --> 01:15:29,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Dennis, I'll be away.

825
01:15:29,748 --> 01:15:30,749
[SPEAKER_12]: I won't be able to attend.

826
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:33,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

827
01:15:33,511 --> 01:15:34,252
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be working.

828
01:15:35,413 --> 01:15:37,355
[SPEAKER_08]: We move in that weekend at the university.

829
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,997
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's two blocks.

830
01:15:40,097 --> 01:15:42,439
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will be available, I think.

831
01:15:45,661 --> 01:15:46,462
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm available.

832
01:15:49,164 --> 01:15:50,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I should be available as well.

833
01:15:52,627 --> 01:15:53,568
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm available.

834
01:15:56,878 --> 01:15:59,140
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've got five, sorry, so we can go forward.

835
01:16:01,982 --> 01:16:02,782
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be available.

836
01:16:03,242 --> 01:16:09,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

837
01:16:09,206 --> 01:16:09,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Building Commissioner.

838
01:16:11,796 --> 01:16:29,463
[SPEAKER_10]: I did want to ask, and I see it briefly mentioned in the agenda post today, Chair, I had sent out an email a couple weeks ago talking about rules and regulations and possibly updating and rewriting your rules and regulations to reflect where we are these days.

839
01:16:29,563 --> 01:16:30,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Had you received that?

840
01:16:30,343 --> 01:16:35,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that I did.

841
01:16:36,767 --> 01:16:41,310
[SPEAKER_10]: because some of the stuff that's in your current rules and regulations are starting to get a little bit dated.

842
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:45,733
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not quite using things that way, and it might be a good time to consider doing that.

843
01:16:47,334 --> 01:16:50,917
[SPEAKER_10]: I suggested so that you could avoid doing it with the whole board at once.

844
01:16:50,937 --> 01:17:05,167
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're amenable to reviewing your rules and regulations, which I can send some copies over from other communities, you might want to appoint a subcommittee of two folks to sort of start hashing them out a little bit so you don't get into the need to have a quorum stuff.

845
01:17:07,466 --> 01:17:13,491
[SPEAKER_10]: but in talking to KP law as well, they felt it's time to consider updating the rules and regulations.

846
01:17:14,512 --> 01:17:14,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

847
01:17:14,652 --> 01:17:15,092
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

848
01:17:15,213 --> 01:17:15,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.

849
01:17:15,713 --> 01:17:16,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I do see that.

850
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:24,060
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will send over some examples I have, and then you can decide how you want to go from there with that.

851
01:17:25,681 --> 01:17:26,302
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be perfect.

852
01:17:26,362 --> 01:17:26,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

853
01:17:44,009 --> 01:17:46,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're at the end of the agenda, so I'll motion to adjourn.

854
01:17:49,871 --> 01:17:50,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

855
01:17:51,052 --> 01:17:51,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

856
01:17:52,712 --> 01:17:53,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call.

857
01:17:53,933 --> 01:17:54,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike?

858
01:17:54,813 --> 01:17:54,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

859
01:17:55,894 --> 01:17:56,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Mary?

860
01:17:56,974 --> 01:17:57,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

861
01:17:58,635 --> 01:17:58,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Andre?

862
01:17:59,575 --> 01:17:59,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

863
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:01,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim?

864
01:18:02,276 --> 01:18:02,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

865
01:18:03,456 --> 01:18:03,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

866
01:18:05,717 --> 01:18:06,858
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the end of our meeting.

867
01:18:07,218 --> 01:18:10,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Next scheduled meeting as discussed will be on August 29th at 6.30pm.

868
01:18:15,716 --> 01:18:17,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, thanks folks.
