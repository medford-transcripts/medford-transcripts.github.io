49
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:45,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, although I don't know the gentleman personally, I have reviewed his resume and it's rather impressive, and I'd ask that the committee move for approval.

50
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,588
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion for approval, Councilor Knight.

51

[SPEAKER_05]: Second?

52
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:51,650

00:02:54,992 --> 00:02:55,732

[SPEAKER_05]: We're glad to have you.

59
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:00,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

60
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:13,397
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to take from unfinished business number 15-734 loan order addition to the DPW facility project fund of $300,000.

61
00:03:14,597 --> 00:03:24,821
[SPEAKER_05]: This motion began its journey with us on November 10th in 2015 after being tabled and referred to committee a number of times.

62
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:36,332
[SPEAKER_05]: It finally passed its first reading this past March, second reading on March 31st, and now is eligible for a third and final reading on today, April 12th.

63
00:03:36,412 --> 00:03:37,992
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

64
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:40,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, yes, thank you very much.

65
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:43,954
[SPEAKER_08]: As noted, this matter has been before the Council a couple of occasions prior.

66
00:03:44,714 --> 00:03:50,116
[SPEAKER_08]: It's relative to some surveying problems that were had with the Winthrop Street drainage project.

67
00:03:50,316 --> 00:03:51,336
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my understanding that

68
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:54,630
[SPEAKER_08]: There is litigation subrogation that's in place relatively.

69
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I looking at the right one?

70
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:56,531
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not looking at the right one.

71
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:56,531
15734.

72
00:03:57,992 --> 00:04:00,033
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the DPW facility.

73
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:01,474
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the DPW facility.

74
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:04,055
[SPEAKER_05]: We just had to tie the up.

75
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:05,556
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an underestimate on some.

76
00:04:05,716 --> 00:04:06,536
[SPEAKER_05]: It was underestimated.

77
00:04:06,616 --> 00:04:09,497
[SPEAKER_08]: It was underestimated on the mitigation for the pollution underground, Mr. President.

78
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:10,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes.

79
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,159
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've passed a couple of readings on this.

80
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,600
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would move for approval on the third reading.

81
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,261
[SPEAKER_08]: It has to get paid one way or the other, Mr. President.

82
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:17,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

83
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:19,002
[SPEAKER_05]: So on a motion for approval by Councilor Knight,

84
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:20,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

85
00:04:20,952 --> 00:04:21,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

86
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

87
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:26,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

88
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:46,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, this, this is the issue that I've had a concern with, uh, for, uh, a number of months now regarding, um, the original estimate that the city hired, uh, an outside consultant to come in and give us an estimate on the contaminants at the DPW yard.

89
00:04:47,857 --> 00:04:48,117
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um,

90
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:53,543
[SPEAKER_03]: The estimate was off by, I believe it was $500,000.

91
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:59,844
[SPEAKER_03]: The estimate was off by $500,000, Mr. President.

92
00:05:00,664 --> 00:05:04,725
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we had many discussions with Louise.

93
00:05:04,745 --> 00:05:05,105
[SPEAKER_05]: The President.

94
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,006
[SPEAKER_05]: We have before us Ms.

95
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:11,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Louise Miller, the Director of Budget and Finance, who can answer any of our questions.

96
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:13,167
[SPEAKER_05]: As she's answered many of them already.

97
00:05:13,227 --> 00:05:14,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, she's answered them all.

98
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,928
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am in opposition of this paper.

99
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:24,860
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to explain why, for the viewing audience, Mr. President, that I feel... If it's too comcastic tonight, it will be viewable.

100
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:26,742
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

101
00:05:27,782 --> 00:05:32,706
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to explain my position, why I'm opposed to this, for the fact that

102
00:05:33,387 --> 00:05:53,357
[SPEAKER_03]: The city went out and hired a consultant to come in and provide the city with facts and figures on what it would cost to remove the contaminants at the DPW yard and to be off by $500,000 on a project that was originally estimated at, what was the amount?

103
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:54,577
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just about $500,000.

104
00:05:54,617 --> 00:05:54,917
[SPEAKER_04]: It was about $500,000.

105
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:55,678
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were off by $500,000.

106
00:05:55,778 --> 00:05:56,778
[SPEAKER_03]: So the project ended up costing us

107
00:06:03,191 --> 00:06:04,792
[SPEAKER_03]: a million dollars, Mr President.

108
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:09,436
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not sure what would we pay this outside consultant.

109
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:12,878
[SPEAKER_04]: It was around $150,000.

110
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:14,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have the exact.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,046
[SPEAKER_03]: So we paid $150,000 to an outside consultant to ask or to let us know what it was gonna cost to remove the contaminants.

112
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:23,746
[SPEAKER_03]: They said 500,000

113
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,625
[SPEAKER_03]: We started the project.

114
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:28,426
[SPEAKER_03]: It was closer to $1 million.

115
00:06:28,886 --> 00:06:35,627
[SPEAKER_03]: So we lost $500,000 on that, and we paid $150,000 for a consultant that gave us bogus information.

116
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:42,429
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's actually $650,000 in net, which I have a real problem with that.

117
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:53,911
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realize that the remedial treatment of what was under there may have differed based on what they found and so forth.

118
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:56,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a tough time thinking.

119
00:06:58,362 --> 00:06:59,963
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like being a meteorologist.

120
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:04,766
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be right 50 percent of the time, and you're doing a good job.

121
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:12,692
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't understand why we'd pay a consultant to come in over $100,000 and be off by 100 percent.

122
00:07:14,053 --> 00:07:17,415
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't sound right to me, Mr. President.

123
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:22,579
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those particular reasons, I cannot support this particular funding.

124
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,845
[SPEAKER_03]: for the cleanup, Mr. President.

125
00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:27,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks, for your frankness.

126
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:34,434
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a motion for a pull by Councilor Knight, a seconded by Councilor Caviello.

127
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:37,157
[SPEAKER_05]: So on that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

128
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:38,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caviello?

129
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:39,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

130
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falcone?

131
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:40,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

132
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:42,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

133
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:42,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

134
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:54,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, with six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes.

135
00:07:55,631 --> 00:07:56,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

136
00:07:56,952 --> 00:07:57,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

137
00:07:57,713 --> 00:07:58,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

138
00:07:58,374 --> 00:07:59,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Loan order passes.

139
00:07:59,698 --> 00:08:00,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, councilors.

140
00:08:00,758 --> 00:08:01,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

141
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:01,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Miller.

142
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:14,344
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to take up item number 16-309, again, an item eligible for third reading, amended ordinance on outdoor dining.

143
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,266
[SPEAKER_05]: After much consideration, we took this up at tonight.

144
00:08:18,686 --> 00:08:23,248
[SPEAKER_05]: It is eligible for its third and final reading tonight, April 12th.

145
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:25,569
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight,

146
00:08:28,545 --> 00:08:29,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

147
00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:37,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Mr. President, it's my understanding that this is just a simple clarification of the existing outdoor dining license ordinance that's in place.

148
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:45,681
[SPEAKER_08]: There was some misinterpretation of the legislative intent that's been addressed through the language in this newly crafted zoning ordinance, and I move for approval.

149
00:08:46,522 --> 00:08:49,545
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion for approval, Councilor Marks.

150
00:08:50,513 --> 00:09:08,160
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to thank the subcommittee that was sent to, Councilor Knight, and under his leadership on that subcommittee, they vetted this even further, the paper that we received from the administration, and I wanted to thank that subcommittee for their due diligence on this.

151
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:10,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

152
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:19,305

[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

00:09:27,552 --> 00:09:29,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_05]: With the vote of 70 affirmative none the negative motion passes on the motion of Council night to while we're in suspension Council night people one five seven eight eight please one five seven eight eight

159
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:45,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to remove this paper from the table and withdraw it, Mr. President.

160
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:46,296
[SPEAKER_08]: This was a paper that I had filed.

161
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:47,177
[SPEAKER_08]: The issue is moot.

162
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:47,797
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been addressed.

163
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:57,623
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion for removing this from the table and returning and putting it back.

164

165
00:09:58,123 --> 00:09:58,383
[SPEAKER_05]: It's done.

[SPEAKER_05]: Withdrawn the paper on that motion.

167
00:10:01,805 --> 00:10:02,565
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

168
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:03,446
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

169
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:05,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to revert back to regular order of business, Mr. President.

170
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:06,748
[SPEAKER_03]: While we're on the suspension.

171
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:08,289
[SPEAKER_05]: While we're on the suspension, Counselor Marks.

172
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:09,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

173
00:10:12,106 --> 00:10:13,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry.

174
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:14,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

175
00:10:16,168 --> 00:10:21,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I received a number of e-mails regarding some of the work that are being done at local parks.

176
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:34,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And I made a phone call and talked to Mike Nesta, the park foreman, and he provided me with a list of parks that are in the process of being rehabbed.

177
00:10:35,098 --> 00:10:39,700
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought it was quite interesting, and I'm not sure maybe other members of the council are aware,

178
00:10:40,368 --> 00:10:47,150
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some linkage money approved last year for the rehab of several parks.

179
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:54,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Morrison Park is undergoing right now new tennis courts, new basketball courts, and fencing.

180
00:10:55,252 --> 00:11:02,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Harris Park, if you go by Harris Park, the old tennis court and the basketball court is totally leveled now.

181
00:11:02,054 --> 00:11:08,336
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just dirt, and they're getting a new basketball court and a new tennis court, as well as fencing around that area.

182
00:11:08,824 --> 00:11:16,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Dugger Park is receiving two new steel basketball backboards in their courts, which appear to be in good shape.

183
00:11:17,648 --> 00:11:28,213
[SPEAKER_03]: And Victory Park had some work done to clean some of the brush and debris along the fencing of Victory Park.

184
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:37,076
[SPEAKER_03]: So that work, from what I understand, is underway and within the next month or two will be completed.

185
00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:38,377
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully for this summer,

186
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:43,216
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have, at least for these parks, updated tennis courts and basketball courts.

187
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:47,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And the tennis courts, we're having a revitalization in Method.

188
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:58,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Tennis is really on the rise in this community, and the demand for tennis courts is really sought after.

189
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,645
[SPEAKER_05]: And the addition of these- The sport of royalty, Councilor.

190
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:04,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe that's why there's such a demand in this community.

191
00:12:05,807 --> 00:12:06,988
[SPEAKER_03]: But the tennis courts,

192
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:13,369
[SPEAKER_03]: that were, I know at Harris Park, were in deplorable shape.

193
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:17,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, there were no nets, so I guess you could say they were worse than deplorable.

194
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:25,554
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's going to add to this community having a lot of other options to play tennis in this community.

195
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:30,196
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to thank the administration, and I know the council president also has a vote on linkage.

196
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:34,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank the council president, because this is well needed.

197
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:36,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for bringing that up, Councilor Maxwell.

198
00:12:37,303 --> 00:12:40,986
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Council Knight to return to the regular order of business, all those in favor?

199
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:44,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, just before we return, if you don't mind.

200
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mind at all.

201
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to congratulate, because it doesn't happen often.

202
00:12:49,713 --> 00:12:58,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Charlotte and Frank Scuderi, they are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary.

203
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,841
[SPEAKER_03]: And you would only think she's 55, Charlotte.

204
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:05,096
[SPEAKER_03]: She actually is celebrating her 50th wedding anniversary.

205
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:08,637
[SPEAKER_03]: And, Charlotte, and I want to congratulate her.

206
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:14,519
[SPEAKER_03]: In this day and age, when you hear 50th, you know, people think a milestone is five years nowadays.

207
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:21,562
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, 50th is quite a — it's quite an accomplishment, Mr. President.

208
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:26,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Both Charlotte and Frank are tremendous people, very active in this community.

209
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:29,765
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to say happy 50th to both of them.

210
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,913
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we can get him a citation, May 1st is the happy day, Mr. Clerk.

211
00:13:36,713 --> 00:13:36,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

212
00:13:37,394 --> 00:13:46,679
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Mox, wishing congratulations to Frank and Charlotte Scuderi on the wonderful occasion of their 50th wedding anniversary.

213
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,619
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

214
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:48,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

215
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,120
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

216
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,221
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion carries.

217
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:54,723
[SPEAKER_05]: And now to return to the regular order of business offered by Councilor Knight.

218
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:55,583
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

219
00:13:56,024 --> 00:13:56,904
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

220
00:13:56,924 --> 00:13:57,745
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion carries.

221
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:01,214
[SPEAKER_05]: 380 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

222
00:14:01,934 --> 00:14:11,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Metro City Council request the Department of Public Works or Park Department to try to clean and polish several war memorial monuments and plaques around the city.

223
00:14:11,858 --> 00:14:18,701
[SPEAKER_05]: With Patriot's Day and Memorial Day approaching, many visitors from around the area come and visit the monuments.

224
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:20,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

225
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:21,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

226
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:27,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, being on the Veterans Committee, I get a lot of calls in regards to some of our memorials.

227
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:36,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if you, in fact, if the one that got me started on this was, uh, the people from, uh, from Pennsylvania will be coming up this year.

228
00:14:36,817 --> 00:14:42,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, her grandfather was a seventh year, seventh generation on the, on the plaque of the library.

229
00:14:43,302 --> 00:14:49,166
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, you know, over the years it's oxidized and it's tarnished and the rock could be cleaned.

230
00:14:49,206 --> 00:14:51,168
[SPEAKER_04]: And at one time there used to be a couple of trees there.

231
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:56,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I had somebody go down that knows about, uh, plaques.

232
00:14:56,572 --> 00:15:04,814
[SPEAKER_04]: and things like that, and they said that the plaques, they're the old plaques, and they need to be actually taken off and refinished, because they can't be cleaned.

233
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:08,215
[SPEAKER_04]: But he says, if you set up your power washer, you might get a little bit cleaner.

234
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:26,099
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could maybe have the parks and departments go around them and do some of the, I know we have multiple memorials around the city, different parks and plaques, and maybe the mayor may have some funding to get these plaques refinished over the next couple of years, to bring them up to life again.

235
00:15:27,065 --> 00:15:38,631
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's something that if the mayor could maybe have the parks department or the public works, maybe they can power wash the area and maybe get some of the oxidation off to make them look nice for the holidays coming up.

236
00:15:39,211 --> 00:15:39,852
[SPEAKER_04]: On that motion.

237
00:15:40,252 --> 00:15:42,813
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was a novice monk up at St.

238
00:15:42,853 --> 00:15:51,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Anselm's College, there were two bronze statues on campus and we used to have to go out twice a year and polish them with bowling alley wax.

239
00:15:51,798 --> 00:15:53,339
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what protected the bronze.

240
00:15:53,933 --> 00:16:03,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, we thought, I was talking with Mr. Lindsey at the veteran's office, and we thought it might have been a project that the vocational school kids might have been able to do.

241
00:16:04,676 --> 00:16:12,918
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm informed that those plaques won't come clean even with acid or anything like that.

242
00:16:13,298 --> 00:16:13,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

243
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:15,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

244
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:19,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, first of all, I'd like to thank Councilor Caviello for bringing this resolution forward.

245
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:22,880
[SPEAKER_08]: He's done a great job on behalf of the veterans here in the community since this election.

246
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:26,670
[SPEAKER_08]: He served diligently as the Chairman of the Veterans Services Subcommittee.

247
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:37,181
[SPEAKER_08]: With that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper and ask that the Director of Veterans Service provide us with a list of all veteran, war, and military monuments, memorials, and plaques in the city.

248
00:16:37,722 --> 00:16:45,150
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd also like to ask the Director of Veterans Services if he can establish a maintenance schedule for said war, memorial,

249
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:48,946
[SPEAKER_08]: monuments and plaques that are across the city, Mr. President.

250
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:52,148
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that this is something that should fall within the purview of our Director of Veteran Services.

251
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:56,971
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that he should be the one that's really taking the lead on this, and that he's the one that's helping coordinate this.

252
00:16:57,051 --> 00:16:59,633
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I move for approval as amended.

253
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:05,857
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Caviello, as seconded and amended by Councilor Knight.

254
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:06,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

255
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:07,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caviello.

256
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:14,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, if I could also amend my motion, I forgot to, but the war memorial that is at Winthrop Street,

257
00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:17,245
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been brought to my attention there's a couple of lights out there.

258
00:17:19,627 --> 00:17:25,570
[SPEAKER_04]: If someone could take care of the couple of lights that are out there, it would be appreciated.

259
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:36,116
[SPEAKER_05]: So further amended by Councilor Caviello that the electrical department examine and replace any defective and or out lights.

260
00:17:36,777 --> 00:17:38,658
[SPEAKER_05]: So on that motion, all those in favor?

261
00:17:39,198 --> 00:17:39,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

262
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,099
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

263
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:42,300
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion carries.

264
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,061
[SPEAKER_05]: 16-381 offered by Councilor Caviello.

265
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:54,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council commended and congratulate Century Bank's Marshal Sloan on the celebration of his 90th birthday.

266
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:56,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy birthday, Marshal, Councilor Caffiello.

267
00:17:56,603 --> 00:17:57,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

268
00:17:57,903 --> 00:18:06,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the honor of being Mr. Sloan's presence this weekend, and his son let me know that it was his birthday.

269
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:10,669
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mr. Sloan has been a great member of this community for many years.

270
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:20,356
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sloan family is very generous with many organizations throughout the city, along with the use of their building for any organization.

271
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:25,419
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would just like to salute the man on his celebration of his 90th birthday.

272
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,783
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, all those in favor, Councilor Knight.

273
00:18:30,803 --> 00:18:33,365
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering if I could ask Councilor Caviello a question.

274
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:34,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

275
00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:36,447
[SPEAKER_07]: At 90 years of age, is Mr. Sloan still working?

276
00:18:36,855 --> 00:18:37,996
[SPEAKER_04]: He is still working every day.

277
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:37,996
90.

278
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,337
[SPEAKER_07]: 90.

279
00:18:40,877 --> 00:18:41,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 90.

280
00:18:41,377 --> 00:18:44,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Works every single day and he approves every single loan that goes through that bank.

281
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:45,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.

282
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:45,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.

283
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:45,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

284
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:47,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Get on his good side.

285
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval.

286
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:50,181
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor.

287
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:52,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

288
00:18:52,942 --> 00:18:54,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday Marshal.

289
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, citizen of the year three or four years ago.

290
00:18:57,264 --> 00:19:01,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

291
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:04,087
[SPEAKER_05]: 16-382 offered by vice-president Ango Kern.

292
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:05,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved.

293
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:09,224
[SPEAKER_05]: that the fifth and sixth grade boys basketball team from St.

294
00:19:09,284 --> 00:19:18,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Raphael's be congratulated on becoming the Northeast Regional CBO champions, CYO champions, Catholic Youth Organization.

295
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:26,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Their hard work and dedication paid off and led them to the title and to an undefeated season.

296
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:33,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it further resolved that they join us to accept accommodations at a future city council meeting.

297
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Vice President.

298
00:19:35,226 --> 00:19:36,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

299
00:19:36,907 --> 00:19:45,813
[SPEAKER_01]: This was brought to my attention that the fifth and sixth grade boys team had won the Northeast Regional CYO Championship down in Connecticut.

300
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,195
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were a travel team, obviously pretty far.

301
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:57,960
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've obviously had a great season, worked very hard, from what I understand, extra practices every week to accomplish such a wonderful goal.

302
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,323
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will get the city clerk a list of names.

303
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:11,116
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we can ask them to a future meeting, hopefully within the next several weeks, to give them accommodations for their accomplishments.

304
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:12,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

305
00:20:12,476 --> 00:20:12,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

306
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:14,397
[SPEAKER_05]: On that motion, all those in favour?

307
00:20:14,617 --> 00:20:14,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

308
00:20:15,017 --> 00:20:15,738
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

309
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:16,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

310
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:21,180
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion, Councillor Knight to suspend the rules.

311
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,961
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favour?

312
00:20:22,361 --> 00:20:23,081
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

313
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:25,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to take the papers in the hands of the clerk.

314
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,883
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion to take the papers in the hand of the clerk.

315
00:20:28,404 --> 00:20:29,244
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favour?

316
00:20:29,624 --> 00:20:30,384
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

317
00:20:30,444 --> 00:20:31,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are many.

318
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:36,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will start off, randomly, more to come.

319
00:20:37,415 --> 00:20:38,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.

320
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:43,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, from our vice president, Brianna Lungo Kern.

321
00:20:44,700 --> 00:21:00,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Metro City Council hold a committee of the whole meeting or a discussion on the council floor, or maybe a visit to a subcommittee, with regards to the Meadow Glen Mall redevelopment.

322
00:21:00,912 --> 00:21:01,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it further resolved.

323
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:07,999
[SPEAKER_05]: a representative from the city administration and the developer be invited to be present.

324
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:09,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Vice President.

325
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

326
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:23,090
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important that the city council gets involved to a point, even if it's just an update meeting, a meeting with regards to getting updates, having questions answered, having concerned citizens speak out.

327
00:21:23,731 --> 00:21:29,155
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very large development that's going to take approximately a year and a half.

328
00:21:30,237 --> 00:21:37,320
[SPEAKER_01]: We have homeowners, obviously, in the condos that abut the mall that have, obviously, questions and concerns.

329
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:49,404
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've done this in the past with regards to developments, asked them to come before the city council meeting to meet, whether it be a half hour to an hour, to just have a discussion and answer any questions that we may have.

330
00:21:49,544 --> 00:21:59,027
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like somebody, obviously, from the development be present and somebody from the city administration to help answer some questions, also be a contact person,

331
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:08,882
[SPEAKER_01]: point person within the city hall so that our recommendations obviously are followed through, such as, you know, what is going to be there for green space?

332
00:22:09,883 --> 00:22:11,363
[SPEAKER_01]: How long is the project going to take?

333
00:22:11,403 --> 00:22:12,504
[SPEAKER_01]: When is it going to be finished?

334
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:18,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Construction-wise, is it going to be disruptive to the residents that live very, very close by?

335
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:22,988
[SPEAKER_01]: A number of questions that probably we should start being on top of now and getting involved in.

336
00:22:23,368 --> 00:22:26,469
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure the administration is in contact with the developer,

337
00:22:27,357 --> 00:22:33,218
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't know who to contact from the development team.

338
00:22:33,238 --> 00:22:41,420
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be good to get a point person from both the city side and the development side so that we can answer questions if residents have them or concerns as they come.

339
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,840
[SPEAKER_01]: I know all of us have got an email recently.

340
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,941
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the reasons why I put this on.

341
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:53,502
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think it's just a massive development in an area where we do have a lot of residents that is a concern to me.

342
00:22:54,443 --> 00:23:00,266
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to make sure everything goes smoothly, and we get the answers that we want from the questions that we have.

343
00:23:01,307 --> 00:23:01,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

344
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:04,408
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion for approval by Vice President Langel-Kern, all those in favor?

345
00:23:04,428 --> 00:23:04,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call.

346
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:07,230
[SPEAKER_05]: A roll call vote has been requested.

347
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, if you would, please call the roll.

348
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:13,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caviello?

349
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:13,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

350
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:14,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

351
00:23:14,634 --> 00:23:15,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

352
00:23:15,514 --> 00:23:15,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Danks?

353
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:16,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

354
00:23:16,455 --> 00:23:18,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Langel-Kern?

355
00:23:18,616 --> 00:23:18,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

356
00:23:20,952 --> 00:23:21,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop voting?

357
00:23:21,452 --> 00:23:21,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

358
00:23:22,273 --> 00:23:22,934
[SPEAKER_06]: President DelaRusso.

359
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:23,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

360
00:23:23,794 --> 00:23:25,836
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll put a seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

361
00:23:25,856 --> 00:23:29,019
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes unanimously.

362
00:23:31,381 --> 00:23:41,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Vice President Lillie Kern, be it resolved that the pothole type street depression at the Brooks School drop-off location be addressed in the interest of public safety.

363
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:41,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Vice President.

364
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

365
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:45,372
[SPEAKER_01]: If we could ask our DPW

366
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,834
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they're filling a ton of potholes.

367
00:23:48,854 --> 00:23:51,355
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it all around the city, and I thank them for that.

368
00:23:51,895 --> 00:23:55,356
[SPEAKER_01]: But from what I understand, somebody recently did get injured at this.

369
00:23:56,316 --> 00:23:59,458
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily a pothole, but it's almost like a depression.

370
00:23:59,518 --> 00:24:10,481
[SPEAKER_01]: And right from the street to the sidewalk, there's a large depression and needs to be filled in the interest of public safety so nobody else gets injured at that location.

371
00:24:11,402 --> 00:24:11,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

372
00:24:11,862 --> 00:24:14,843
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion approved by, oh, Council Member Marks.

373
00:24:15,276 --> 00:24:19,598
[SPEAKER_03]: If Councilor Longo doesn't mind, I'd like to amend it to add on Salem Street.

374
00:24:20,098 --> 00:24:31,504
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a portion of Salem Street where you can see the old railroad car tracks underneath the road from 100 years ago.

375
00:24:32,065 --> 00:24:33,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Roughly where?

376
00:24:33,945 --> 00:24:35,646
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in front of Ronnie's place.

377
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:37,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that still on the corner over there?

378
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:38,348
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

379
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:40,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right on Salem Street.

380
00:24:40,593 --> 00:24:42,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Spring and Salem is Ronnie's.

381
00:24:42,255 --> 00:24:43,036
[SPEAKER_01]: It moved a little bit.

382
00:24:43,296 --> 00:24:45,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, no, where they used to be.

383
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Park and Salem.

384
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:49,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Park and Salem.

385
00:24:49,842 --> 00:24:50,143
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

386
00:24:50,543 --> 00:24:51,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Right in that area.

387
00:24:51,244 --> 00:24:52,405
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the tire tracks.

388
00:24:52,925 --> 00:25:01,874
[SPEAKER_03]: And on Riverside Ave, there are a number of manhole covers that have some real giant holes right next to the manhole covers.

389
00:25:02,275 --> 00:25:03,756
[SPEAKER_03]: They look like they appear to be sinking.

390
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:11,412
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's at roughly Riverside and Locusts and Riverside and Spring Street.

391
00:25:11,432 --> 00:25:13,752
[SPEAKER_03]: So further down from where that whole stretch was repaved.

392
00:25:13,832 --> 00:25:14,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

393
00:25:14,332 --> 00:25:15,192
[SPEAKER_03]: And that stretch there.

394
00:25:15,412 --> 00:25:15,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

395
00:25:16,093 --> 00:25:23,154
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion for approval by Lungo, Councilor, Vice President Lungo Kern, as amended by Councilor Marks.

396
00:25:23,214 --> 00:25:23,914
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

397
00:25:24,454 --> 00:25:25,035
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

398
00:25:25,075 --> 00:25:25,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

399
00:25:26,455 --> 00:25:29,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Councilor... No, I didn't do that one yet.

400
00:25:30,356 --> 00:25:31,756
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one I had in my hand to read.

401
00:25:32,412 --> 00:25:43,416
[SPEAKER_05]: offered by Vice President Longo Kern, be it resolved that any notices such as street sleeping be posted on the city website as well as through other methods of communication and notification.

402
00:25:43,456 --> 00:25:44,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Vice President.

403
00:25:44,637 --> 00:25:47,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

404
00:25:48,018 --> 00:25:50,399
[SPEAKER_01]: I received a call from somebody who was upset.

405
00:25:50,439 --> 00:26:01,483
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like they made a call and asked what streets were getting swept when, and they were told they can find that information only on the website, and it didn't seem like it was posted anywhere else.

406
00:26:02,217 --> 00:26:03,998
[SPEAKER_01]: This person was upset, didn't have a computer.

407
00:26:04,618 --> 00:26:08,479
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree with the complaint.

408
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:18,302
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to just make sure that when we do have any notices that need to go out to the public, I think it's wonderful that we are utilizing our website.

409
00:26:18,483 --> 00:26:22,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the transparency is so much better than it ever has been.

410
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:30,787
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would just also request that we be posting things in the paper, making actual posts, whether it be at City Hall.

411
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:37,011
[SPEAKER_01]: on documents, on billboards, at the library, and any other means of communication.

412
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:49,501
[SPEAKER_01]: And that if there is a certain post that needs to be made on the website, that certain departments know that if somebody calls and asks questions, that they can be answered that way, too, verbally.

413
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:52,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some people don't have a computer, some people don't have phones.

414
00:26:52,503 --> 00:26:57,347
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to make sure information is getting out by many means of communication rather than just

415
00:26:58,272 --> 00:27:04,938
[SPEAKER_01]: directing everybody to the website, because some people actually do go to the library to do all their computer work, and you can't get there all the time.

416
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:10,042
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's very important just to bring up, because the resident that did call me was very, very upset.

417
00:27:10,122 --> 00:27:14,426
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure we're accommodating to, you know, everybody.

418
00:27:15,507 --> 00:27:16,948
[SPEAKER_05]: On that motion, all those in favor?

419
00:27:17,449 --> 00:27:17,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

420
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:18,470
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

421
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

422
00:27:20,091 --> 00:27:25,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Councilors Caraviello, Vice President Lungo-Kern, and Councilor Scappelli.

423
00:27:26,474 --> 00:27:32,779
[SPEAKER_05]: be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request a report from the mayor regarding the Veterans Advisory Committee Council.

424
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:33,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair Viello?

425
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,723
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that committee is underway because of your good efforts.

426
00:27:36,803 --> 00:27:37,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Mr. President.

427
00:27:37,744 --> 00:27:39,245
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know the mayor has adopted it.

428
00:27:39,765 --> 00:27:41,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know many people have sent in applications.

429
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:49,714
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just wanted to know if we could have a report on where it is in the mayor's calendar of selecting members.

430
00:27:50,134 --> 00:27:50,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

431
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,536
[SPEAKER_04]: So on that motion, Madam Vice President.

432
00:27:52,677 --> 00:27:53,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

433
00:27:54,543 --> 00:28:01,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank Councilor Carviel for bringing this resolution forward a few months ago, and I thank the mayor's office for moving forward with it.

434
00:28:01,867 --> 00:28:11,573
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know there were a number of people that have contacted me and submitted applications, so if we could maybe find out how many people applied, how many people are intended to be on the board.

435
00:28:11,613 --> 00:28:13,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if we got clarification of that 100%.

436
00:28:13,815 --> 00:28:19,658
[SPEAKER_01]: And I too would like to find out when that's going to come to fruition.

437
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:21,980
[SPEAKER_05]: So on that motion, all those in favor?

438
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,500
[SPEAKER_01]: As amended.

439
00:28:22,997 --> 00:28:30,783
[SPEAKER_05]: As amended by Councilor Mice, Vice-President Long and Kern.

440
00:28:33,986 --> 00:28:35,367
[SPEAKER_05]: On that motion, all those in favor?

441
00:28:35,827 --> 00:28:36,468
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

442
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:37,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

443
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Be resolved by Councilor Knight.

444
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:48,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Be resolved that the plated catch basin at Winthrop and Rural Labs be adjusted to ensure public safety.

445
00:28:48,578 --> 00:28:49,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

446
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

447
00:28:50,901 --> 00:28:57,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caviello actually brought this very issue up several weeks ago asking what was going on with that steel plate.

448
00:28:57,907 --> 00:29:04,212
[SPEAKER_08]: And the response that we received back from the DPW was that it's a catch basin that has been plated because it has collapsed and is scheduled to be repaired.

449
00:29:04,872 --> 00:29:08,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, today as I was driving home from the office, I did notice that the

450
00:29:08,536 --> 00:29:11,638
[SPEAKER_08]: steel plate is about six to eight inches off the ground.

451
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:19,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Puddles pooling, Mr. President, due to the weather conditions, and it just needs a little bit of an adjustment so that it makes the situation a little bit safer there.

452
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:28,806
[SPEAKER_08]: I think part of the problem is the fact that it's very close to a bus stop, and when the bus pulls over, it stops right next to the plate and then drives over the plate and adjusts it due to the weight of the vehicle.

453
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:33,348
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I'd ask that this matter be approved by the Council and forwarded to the DPW.

454
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:36,453
[SPEAKER_05]: All the motion approved by Councillor Knight, all those in favour?

455
00:29:36,694 --> 00:29:37,294
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

456
00:29:37,594 --> 00:29:37,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Carries.

457
00:29:38,335 --> 00:29:39,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Councillor Marks.

458
00:29:39,896 --> 00:29:43,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that speeding cars on Forest Street be discussed.

459
00:29:43,358 --> 00:29:44,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Marks.

460
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Speeding cars.

461
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

462
00:29:48,601 --> 00:30:00,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I received an email from a resident on Roosevelt Road, which we all know is the road when you're coming right off of Roosevelt Circle, the first road on the right-hand side.

463
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And residents are very concerned

464
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:11,298
[SPEAKER_03]: that cars coming off of Roosevelt Circle are coming down Forest Street and they're really coming at a great clip.

465
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:30,767
[SPEAKER_03]: And residents are concerned that have children in the area and want some additional signage along that portion of Forest Street and possibly to look at maybe a raised crosswalk in the area to slow down some of the traffic coming off that particular area.

466
00:30:31,231 --> 00:30:58,352
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would want to offer that as a resolution tonight asking that the Traffic Commission look into increased speeding signage at Roosevelt Road and Forest Street and also Roosevelt Circle and that the possibility of a raised crosswalk or any other traffic calming approaches in that particular area, which is posing a real safety concern for area residents.

467
00:31:00,248 --> 00:31:01,869
[SPEAKER_03]: be discussed by the Traffic Commission.

468
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:04,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

469
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:06,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your efforts in public safety on that matter.

470
00:31:06,753 --> 00:31:08,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

471
00:31:08,514 --> 00:31:09,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

472
00:31:09,295 --> 00:31:13,438
[SPEAKER_04]: If Councilor Marks wouldn't object, if we could add Governors Avenue onto that list also.

473
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:17,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I've received numerous calls from many residents on Governors Avenue.

474
00:31:18,141 --> 00:31:20,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Same problem, cars speeding on both sides of the road.

475
00:31:21,243 --> 00:31:24,085
[SPEAKER_04]: As amended by Councilor Caviello, Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

476
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:27,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I'd like to thank Councilman Knox for bringing this resolution forward.

477
00:31:28,944 --> 00:31:42,835
[SPEAKER_08]: On two occasions, this council has approved resolutions to put a crosswalk at Forest Street between King Ave and Cedar Road to allow safe crossing of Forest Street to the newly renovated McNally Playground.

478
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:47,638
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd ask that we amend the paper to receive an update on the status thereof, Mr. President.

479
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:54,203
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion to, on the amendment of Councilor Knight, Madam Vice President.

480
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

481
00:31:56,211 --> 00:32:04,519
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could also amend this paper with regards to the traffic calming approaches, we always ask that the speedometer be placed at different locations.

482
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:13,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the last update we got, I don't know if I personally got it or if the entire council got it, was that the speedometer machine was out of service.

483
00:32:13,827 --> 00:32:20,493
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we could just get an update on that and a cost estimate to fix that machine.

484
00:32:21,526 --> 00:32:24,888
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we can maybe evaluate it at budget time, because I think that's really important.

485
00:32:25,008 --> 00:32:29,811
[SPEAKER_01]: I know enforcement is, you know, it's hard to enforce every road.

486
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:31,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I've complained about Harvard, Forest.

487
00:32:31,753 --> 00:32:34,334
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we each are complaining about different streets at different times.

488
00:32:34,735 --> 00:32:39,598
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a huge speed calming approach that I think is necessary.

489
00:32:39,638 --> 00:32:42,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And we only had one, and from what I understand, it's broken.

490
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,982
[SPEAKER_05]: And where it's been used, it's been very effective.

491
00:32:46,082 --> 00:32:47,423
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very effective, yes.

492
00:32:47,863 --> 00:32:48,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

493
00:32:48,723 --> 00:32:50,965
[SPEAKER_05]: So on that main motion as amended,

494
00:32:51,435 --> 00:32:52,196
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

495
00:32:52,856 --> 00:32:53,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Those opposed?

496
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

497
00:32:54,997 --> 00:32:56,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Councilor Marks.

498
00:32:56,718 --> 00:33:09,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Right Honorable Representative Paul J. Denau to provide the City Council with an update on the current status of the Charter Review Home Rule Petition approved by the Mayor and the City Council.

499
00:33:09,986 --> 00:33:10,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

500
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:12,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

501
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:16,830
[SPEAKER_03]: This was approved several weeks back by this body and signed by the Mayor.

502
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,412
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my understanding that it's currently before the state legislature.

503
00:33:21,257 --> 00:33:41,785
[SPEAKER_03]: And whereas, there is some time sensitivity on having this go through the state legislature, I would ask that representative Donato provide this council with an update on the current status and what else maybe we as a community can do to shepherd this along through the house and the senate.

504
00:33:42,285 --> 00:33:42,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

505
00:33:42,965 --> 00:33:43,825
[SPEAKER_07]: So on that motion.

506
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:48,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, it has to be recorded in opposition on this matter, Mr. President.

507
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:50,268
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel as though the process

508
00:33:51,514 --> 00:33:53,595
[SPEAKER_08]: could have been handled a little differently, and I'm not supportive of it.

509
00:33:54,196 --> 00:33:54,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

510
00:33:55,717 --> 00:33:58,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Read the resolve one more time, please, before the vote is taken.

511
00:33:58,659 --> 00:34:00,880
[SPEAKER_05]: It just got folded up and put away.

512
00:34:01,461 --> 00:34:05,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Councilor Marks.

513
00:34:05,484 --> 00:34:14,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that Representative Donato provide the City Council with an update on the current status of the Charter Review Home Rule Petition approved by the Mayor and the City Council.

514
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:18,713
[SPEAKER_05]: On that motion, all those in favor?

515
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:22,578
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed, Mr. Clerk, please mark as requested.

516
00:34:23,018 --> 00:34:26,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor Knight as in opposition.

517
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

518
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one more.

519
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:39,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved, offered by Counselor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council hold a moment of silence in memory of late State Senator Charlie Shannon.

520
00:34:40,523 --> 00:34:47,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it further resolved, whereas April 10th, 2016 marked the 11th annual anniversary of his passing

521
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,703
[SPEAKER_05]: this evening's meeting be dedicated in his honor, Counselor Knight.

522
00:34:53,584 --> 00:34:54,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

523
00:34:55,145 --> 00:35:01,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I had the distinct honor and pleasure of working for Senator Shannon, as did Counselor Marks, as well as Counselor Carvio's son, Richard.

524
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:16,380
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just think that it would be fitting and quite a tribute to the service and dedication that this gentleman gave the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the citizens of this district over his 20 plus years as a state senator and his 20 years before that as a law enforcement officer.

525
00:35:17,371 --> 00:35:20,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Senator Shannon died of cancer back in 2005.

526
00:35:22,072 --> 00:35:29,333
[SPEAKER_08]: He gave me a shot right out of college as an intern, and I ended up becoming a member of his staff and worked with him from 1999 until his untimely passing.

527
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:30,894
[SPEAKER_08]: He's sadly missed.

528
00:35:30,914 --> 00:35:37,675
[SPEAKER_08]: He's made a great deal of change and effectuated the number of people's lives in a positive way in this community, Mr. President.

529
00:35:37,715 --> 00:35:42,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's only fitting that we remember and reflect upon the contributions that he's made to the citizens of Medford.

530
00:35:44,832 --> 00:35:48,734
[SPEAKER_05]: On that motion, if you would all rise and join us in a moment of silence.

531
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we return to the regular order of business, two items.

532
00:36:06,263 --> 00:36:13,667
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, next week on Monday, April 18th, is Memorial Day, Patriot's Day.

533
00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:34,001
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, so the annual celebrations will take place starting this year at 10 o'clock at the, uh, old burial ground on Salem street, uh, at 10 45, we'll gather in front of the Gaffey funeral home, the Isaac Hall house at the corner of, um, uh, high and Bradley.

534
00:36:34,281 --> 00:36:34,461
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

535
00:36:34,621 --> 00:36:34,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

536
00:36:35,842 --> 00:36:42,166
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, wait to welcome Paul Revere, all the welcome plenty of activities, plenty of music,

537
00:36:42,696 --> 00:36:44,297
[SPEAKER_05]: song activities for the kids.

538
00:36:44,957 --> 00:36:47,859
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we hope to have everybody there.

539
00:36:48,299 --> 00:36:54,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Secondly, Barbara Kerr has been appointed as a librarian for the city of Medford.

540
00:36:54,422 --> 00:37:04,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations to Barbara and thanks to her and all the many, uh, dedications that she's given to the improvement of the Medford public library.

541
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we go back to the regular order of business, did councilor Caviello want to speak?

542
00:37:08,308 --> 00:37:09,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Did madam vice president want to speak?

543
00:37:11,385 --> 00:37:16,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Just want to also wish good luck to all the Medford residents running the Boston Marathon.

544
00:37:16,447 --> 00:37:22,270
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that you'll either be watching the Boston Marathon, or you'll be in Medford Square on Monday.

545
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:22,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you running?

546
00:37:23,751 --> 00:37:26,232
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not running, but a good friend of mine, Meg Richard, is running.

547
00:37:26,472 --> 00:37:29,413
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's, I think, 86 Medford residents running.

548
00:37:30,254 --> 00:37:31,334
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been there, done that.

549
00:37:32,175 --> 00:37:34,136
[SPEAKER_01]: So just want to wish everybody good luck.

550
00:37:34,156 --> 00:37:35,716
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a great day.

551
00:37:35,736 --> 00:37:37,077
[SPEAKER_05]: But Council Box is running again this year?

552
00:37:38,073 --> 00:37:39,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations, too.

553
00:37:39,474 --> 00:37:44,538
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going back out to Halston?

554
00:37:44,998 --> 00:37:46,839
[SPEAKER_05]: All righty.

555
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,103
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to return to the regular order of business, all those in favor?

556
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:53,243
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

557
00:37:53,283 --> 00:37:54,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

558
00:37:55,124 --> 00:37:59,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

559
00:37:59,327 --> 00:38:03,550
[SPEAKER_05]: 16-383, petition by Jean M. Martin of 10 Cumming Street, Bedford, Massachusetts,

560
00:38:03,944 --> 00:38:16,567
[SPEAKER_05]: to address the council on Chevalier Theater, the library, community access, and the community preservation fund, we welcome to the podium Citizen Martin to state her name and address for the record.

561
00:38:16,768 --> 00:38:17,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

562
00:38:17,368 --> 00:38:18,628
[SPEAKER_00]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

563
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:24,410
[SPEAKER_00]: This city needs to formulate a cohesive plan for the resources we already own.

564
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:33,012
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a group of committed people devoted to the arts, but lack a concept of how the current institutions can be linked together.

565
00:38:34,272 --> 00:38:36,133
[SPEAKER_00]: We have everything backwards.

566
00:38:36,633 --> 00:38:38,414
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chevalier is built for the arts.

567
00:38:39,054 --> 00:38:42,316
[SPEAKER_00]: While it started out as a school theater, it is now an adult theater.

568
00:38:42,976 --> 00:38:51,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet we have a boys and girls club in the adult theater basement and adults meeting in schools, buildings designed for kids.

569
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:59,465
[SPEAKER_00]: To state the obvious, schools are built for kids, but not for adult meeting spaces to be purchased to pay for school programs.

570
00:39:00,085 --> 00:39:03,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Taxes are paid to pay for school programs.

571
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:11,286
[SPEAKER_00]: For money, we have turned our public theater into a church and our schools into community centers for adults.

572
00:39:12,447 --> 00:39:15,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if we said it out loud, it will sink in.

573
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:17,848
[SPEAKER_00]: When does it stop?

574
00:39:18,508 --> 00:39:23,589
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we make $500 off of one rental for the theater.

575
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:28,690
[SPEAKER_00]: Two rentals at $500 even starts to sound better.

576
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,471
[SPEAKER_00]: The same could be said for the schools.

577
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:33,551
[SPEAKER_00]: When does it stop?

578
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,080
[SPEAKER_00]: then the infighting of who gets what time and for what price.

579
00:39:40,201 --> 00:39:45,383
[SPEAKER_00]: These buildings are not businesses, and they were not designed to be businesses.

580
00:39:46,383 --> 00:39:57,187
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a breach of the Constitution with the Chevalier by renting it to religious groups, and we have a breach of security by renting a child-rich environment to strange adults in the schools.

581
00:39:58,468 --> 00:40:03,970
[SPEAKER_00]: The library needs to become fresh with a new concept for the millennial generation and the generation that is following.

582
00:40:04,992 --> 00:40:13,157
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chevalier is a gift from heaven that most communities would die for, yet we have to rent it to religious groups to keep the doors open.

583
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:19,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if those two buildings aren't enough, we have money available through the community access station.

584
00:40:19,861 --> 00:40:21,662
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the goose that lays the golden eggs.

585
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:33,329
[SPEAKER_00]: The money is not produced through the tax base, but our cable bills, but gives generously towards both the general fund and the arts community.

586
00:40:34,408 --> 00:40:40,032
[SPEAKER_00]: The city apparently still has a bad taste in its mouth from the last community access station.

587
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:44,735
[SPEAKER_00]: But this city's arts community is going to have to step up and do something with it.

588
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:59,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask for money when money is sitting in unused accounts just because it is hard to work out the details.

589
00:41:00,366 --> 00:41:01,186
[SPEAKER_00]: I have news for you.

590
00:41:01,527 --> 00:41:02,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Life is hard.

591
00:41:03,733 --> 00:41:07,796
[SPEAKER_00]: This city is missing out on recording its history, sports, arts, news, and culture.

592
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:17,223
[SPEAKER_00]: You, the arts community, with your infighting, are not stepping up to the plate you have been assigned to by virtue of your talents and status in the city.

593
00:41:18,284 --> 00:41:20,286
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be popular, but it needs to be said.

594
00:41:21,006 --> 00:41:24,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you enjoy the Boys and Girls Club in the basement of the Chevalier.

595
00:41:24,729 --> 00:41:32,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not put the Boys and Girls Club in a school, a designated kid's space, and release that basement for a community space

596
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:34,405
[SPEAKER_00]: or the community access station.

597
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:42,652
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, you have the community preservation fund, which many of you thought was a good idea.

598
00:41:43,912 --> 00:41:46,274
[SPEAKER_00]: I now count that on your ledger for the arts.

599
00:41:47,515 --> 00:41:51,198
[SPEAKER_00]: You have three existing entities to express yourselves through.

600
00:41:51,819 --> 00:41:54,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Come together and maximize what we already have.

601
00:41:54,881 --> 00:41:58,704
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask for yet another building when we are neglecting the ones we have now.

602
00:41:59,722 --> 00:42:04,846
[SPEAKER_00]: The West Medford Community Center and the South Medford Fire Station have community space available for meetings.

603
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:11,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Point of fact, Springstep, a non-profit in this city designed for the arts, went out of business.

604
00:42:12,152 --> 00:42:12,652
[SPEAKER_00]: It folded.

605
00:42:13,973 --> 00:42:20,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should we create yet another building for the arts when we have two already, and three with a TV station in the square?

606
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, the pot of money you just created through the CPA.

607
00:42:26,332 --> 00:42:30,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Use what we have, build on them, and be grateful you have what you do.

608
00:42:31,034 --> 00:42:31,274
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.

609
00:42:32,914 --> 00:42:36,976
[SPEAKER_00]: And for my blue-collar and pink-collar fellow citizens, you're not off the hook either.

610
00:42:37,916 --> 00:42:42,177
[SPEAKER_00]: You all were up here demanding bonding for new sports arenas and got every one of them.

611
00:42:42,898 --> 00:42:47,119
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the swimming pool, Hormel, and the Field of Dreams by borrowing into your kids' future.

612
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,281
[SPEAKER_00]: While it is easy to pick on the new primarily white-collar class moving in,

613
00:42:53,897 --> 00:43:02,663
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see you all asking for bonding for police cruisers, asphalt for the roads, or demanding the water sewer money be spent on water pipe replacement right under our feet.

614
00:43:03,624 --> 00:43:10,849
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue and pink collar people in this city have been looking out for what they value too, which are sports and recreational facilities.

615
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:17,594
[SPEAKER_00]: While everyone can get behind kids, these facilities are also luxuries, though you may not see it that way.

616
00:43:18,414 --> 00:43:20,556
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to focus on building maintenance in this city.

617
00:43:21,196 --> 00:43:23,378
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I know, it's a deep sleeper.

618
00:43:23,827 --> 00:43:24,768
[SPEAKER_00]: but it has to get done.

619
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,972
[SPEAKER_00]: This city is not making the mayor's job any easier.

620
00:43:32,973 --> 00:43:42,158
[SPEAKER_00]: She knows full well what needs to be done in Medford and where the financial resources need to go, but she hears from you with your hands out, we want more, please.

621
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:48,802
[SPEAKER_00]: We all need to accept that government money is not a part of endless cash.

622
00:43:49,603 --> 00:43:52,805
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it all, but I have news for everyone, you can't have it all.

623
00:43:53,643 --> 00:44:03,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Start applying pressure on the mayor to take care of the buildings we currently own, including the schools, which I know you all care about, blue-collar, no-collar, and white-collar alike.

624
00:44:04,271 --> 00:44:18,762
[SPEAKER_00]: To the white-collar newcomer, please realize you have more disposable income than others in this city, and those without your excess dollars become resentful of you because you are increasing their standard of living, actually pushing them out of this city.

625
00:44:19,835 --> 00:44:25,017
[SPEAKER_00]: They resent you because you have the luxury of being able to think beyond the necessities of life.

626
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:32,239
[SPEAKER_00]: And for you blue-collar guys, I don't see you protesting in the streets for systematic reform of the way business is done here.

627
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,820
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time you, too, step up.

628
00:44:35,661 --> 00:44:39,422
[SPEAKER_00]: Stand out in Medford Square with a sign for scheduled systematic street sweeping.

629
00:44:40,522 --> 00:44:41,403
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't, can you?

630
00:44:41,923 --> 00:44:42,183
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

631
00:44:42,903 --> 00:44:47,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Because how can the DPW do its job if the streets are littered with cars?

632
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:54,677
[SPEAKER_00]: The working class has priorities, too, that do not always coincide with the city's ability to take care of itself.

633
00:44:55,697 --> 00:45:01,138
[SPEAKER_00]: It is easy for everyone to get behind kids, and parks are important, but they are not the only need in the city.

634
00:45:01,778 --> 00:45:04,839
[SPEAKER_00]: Start thinking about what doesn't automatically pop into your head.

635
00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:10,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Sports facilities are not mandated by government, and you, too, should appreciate what we have.

636
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:17,242
[SPEAKER_00]: I know many of you want to tell me to go pound sand right now, but someone has to speak truth to power.

637
00:45:17,955 --> 00:45:22,016
[SPEAKER_00]: The city is slowly receding, in spite of the spike in property values.

638
00:45:22,896 --> 00:45:26,897
[SPEAKER_00]: The city's diagnosis is in, but the remedy is painful to all.

639
00:45:27,237 --> 00:45:27,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

640
00:45:30,017 --> 00:45:30,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

641
00:45:30,537 --> 00:45:30,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Maher.

642
00:45:31,497 --> 00:45:35,158
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councillor Knight to receive and place on file, Councillor Marx.

643
00:45:35,638 --> 00:45:42,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Just if I could, I want to thank Jean for her comments, and many of them hit home because they're true.

644
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,900
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing I do want to mention, I think it was two weeks ago,

645
00:45:46,671 --> 00:46:01,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lungo-Kern offered a resolution to find out from the administration how people can apply for the exemption for the Community Preservation Act, and we didn't receive a response, as I know from that.

646
00:46:02,438 --> 00:46:14,923
[SPEAKER_03]: And last week I offered something very similar that the administration, because a letter went out in the tax bill alerting people of the Community Preservation Act, but there was never any discussion

647
00:46:15,387 --> 00:46:17,248
[SPEAKER_03]: about how to apply for an exemption.

648
00:46:18,169 --> 00:46:28,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And to date, we have not received on two separate — dating now 14 days — two separate resolves dealing with the exemption for residents.

649
00:46:29,717 --> 00:46:37,663
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one thing, Mr. President, that this was voted on, and, you know, the people are going to have to pay the additional 1.5 percent surcharge.

650
00:46:38,104 --> 00:46:42,767
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's another thing not to alert people that may be eligible for an exemption

651
00:46:43,645 --> 00:46:48,569
[SPEAKER_03]: that could surely use it, that this is available, and how to apply for it.

652
00:46:49,510 --> 00:47:11,067
[SPEAKER_03]: So, again, I would ask, Mr. President, that we receive a correspondence from the mayor and that the citizenry be notified on how to apply for an exemption for the Community Preservation Act and what are the eligibility requirements based on state law.

653
00:47:11,938 --> 00:47:21,066
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, to receive the paper from the petitioner and place it on file.

654
00:47:21,086 --> 00:47:21,787
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

655
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:22,787
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

656
00:47:23,228 --> 00:47:28,733
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, I'm to suspension for an update.

657
00:47:28,953 --> 00:47:34,217
[SPEAKER_05]: And with those fine points, Mr. Clerk, to hear a report back from the administrator.

658
00:47:34,417 --> 00:47:35,498
[SPEAKER_05]: On those two resolutions.

659
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,220
[SPEAKER_05]: On those two resolutions as well.

660
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:40,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Vice President Longo-Kerr.

661
00:47:40,337 --> 00:47:41,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

662
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:50,384
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to second that because when I brought it up two weeks ago, from what I understood, there was only about one more week to apply for an exemption.

663
00:47:50,485 --> 00:47:54,768
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that was the case, then it's almost too late to apply for an exemption.

664
00:47:54,828 --> 00:48:06,937
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think one of my points, and I think the council agreed with the resolution, is that we extend that time for an exemption because I wholeheartedly agree that there's an exemption portion in this law for a reason.

665
00:48:07,293 --> 00:48:13,238
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people out there that need an exemption, financially, obviously, for financial reasons.

666
00:48:13,598 --> 00:48:15,580
[SPEAKER_01]: So they should be aware of it.

667
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:27,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said earlier in tonight's meeting, we should be not only posting information on the exemption online, we should be posting it at the library and in the paper so that people who need an exemption can apply for it.

668
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:33,555
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really pray that the administration extends that time frame if for some reason it has passed.

669
00:48:33,978 --> 00:48:44,002
[SPEAKER_01]: to give the residents that have no idea about the exemption or how to apply for it the time they need to research it and figure out if they can apply for it and get the exemption.

670
00:48:44,022 --> 00:48:52,246
[SPEAKER_01]: I found out from a resident I had no idea with regards to any timelines for exemptions and that they would be coming up so soon.

671
00:48:52,646 --> 00:48:56,648
[SPEAKER_01]: So if us counselors didn't know, obviously the general public does not know.

672
00:48:56,788 --> 00:49:00,550
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have a senior citizen or somebody who can apply for this exemption,

673
00:49:01,866 --> 00:49:02,726
[SPEAKER_01]: had no idea.

674
00:49:02,746 --> 00:49:04,487
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's highly unfair.

675
00:49:04,907 --> 00:49:17,951
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just truly believe and really hope that the administration will do the right thing and extend that time frame and give it at least another month with advertisement and with notification to our residents.

676
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:19,832
[SPEAKER_01]: We use the 911 system.

677
00:49:20,032 --> 00:49:23,833
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's now a Facebook page or Where's Barry Clemente?

678
00:49:23,873 --> 00:49:26,474
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people are used to hearing from them.

679
00:49:26,554 --> 00:49:31,255
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think a reverse call needs to go out with regards to when this exemption

680
00:49:31,806 --> 00:49:37,170
[SPEAKER_01]: date is coming and what they need to do to apply for it and get more information on it.

681
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,272
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really hope that that happens.

682
00:49:39,912 --> 00:49:45,136
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Vice President Longo Kern.

683
00:49:45,196 --> 00:49:45,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

684
00:49:46,357 --> 00:49:47,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Mr. President.

685
00:49:47,098 --> 00:49:47,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

686
00:49:47,898 --> 00:49:58,126
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my understanding of the language that was adopted here in the city of Medford that there are a number of exemptions, but there's one big exemption and that's the automatic exemption for the $100,000 off your

687
00:50:00,728 --> 00:50:02,889
[SPEAKER_08]: And that, I believe, is an exemption that you don't need to apply for.

688
00:50:02,909 --> 00:50:04,090
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an automatic exemption.

689
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:12,856
[SPEAKER_08]: So if your home is valued at $300,000, you have an automatic exemption on the first $100,000, and then the assessment will be leveled on to the $200,000 figure.

690
00:50:13,456 --> 00:50:19,380
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wanted to be clear that there's no application process for the initial $100,000 exemption.

691
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,361
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an automatic exemption that's applicable to everybody.

692
00:50:21,922 --> 00:50:22,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

693
00:50:22,542 --> 00:50:26,945
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion for approval by Councillor Marx, seconded by

694
00:50:27,905 --> 00:50:29,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice president low current.

695
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:29,906
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor.

696
00:50:31,187 --> 00:50:35,390
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed on the motion of council Falco for a German.

697
00:50:36,211 --> 00:50:36,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the records.

698
00:50:36,991 --> 00:50:38,352
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Mr. Counselor.

699
00:50:38,392 --> 00:50:38,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

700
00:50:39,152 --> 00:50:39,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor marks.

701
00:50:40,653 --> 00:50:42,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to present some good news.

702
00:50:42,955 --> 00:50:48,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, last night, uh, the method dog park committee met, uh, they've had a number of meetings.

703
00:50:48,939 --> 00:50:56,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, the grant application was submitted, uh, for a future dog park just recently to the

704
00:50:56,983 --> 00:51:04,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Stanton Foundation for a request of $250,000 to get this dog park underway.

705
00:51:04,744 --> 00:51:24,448
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to recognize there have been five members of this dog park committee who have set up a website, who have done yeoman's work keeping this issue up on behalf of the thousands of dog owners in this community that have really no place to walk their dog or exercise their dog or have their dog

706
00:51:24,901 --> 00:51:27,443
[SPEAKER_03]: mingle with other dogs, which is very important.

707

[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to thank Patty Flynn, Jim Silva, Gary DeStefano, Diane Savoni, and Britt Fitch for their work and their countless hours in moving this forward steadily.

708
00:51:40,551 --> 00:51:48,836
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also want to thank Mayor McGlynn and also Mayor Burke, who now is on board with moving this park forward.

709
00:51:49,536 --> 00:51:52,258
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm hoping that this grant goes through, Mr. President.

710
00:51:53,123 --> 00:52:00,325
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, it's going to be a real plus for method residents to finally have a place they can exercise and walk their dog.

711
00:52:00,745 --> 00:52:01,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, counselor.

712
00:52:01,445 --> 00:52:03,125
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you for your leadership on that committee.

713
00:52:03,945 --> 00:52:07,226

714
00:52:07,606 --> 00:52:09,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Counselor, how do you find those records?

715
00:52:11,087 --> 00:52:13,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I see that counselor, counselor Falco.

716
00:52:14,068 --> 00:52:15,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, how do you find those records?

717
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:20,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I reviewed the records, found them to be in order and move approval.

718
00:52:21,196 --> 00:52:27,140
[SPEAKER_05]: on the motion for approval of the records of the meeting of April 5th by Councilor Falco.

719
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:28,420
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

720
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:29,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

721
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:30,282
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

722
00:52:30,762 --> 00:52:31,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

723
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:35,124
[SPEAKER_05]: The chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

724
00:52:35,204 --> 00:52:37,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Please state your name and address for the record.

725
00:52:37,586 --> 00:52:40,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

726
00:52:41,348 --> 00:52:47,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor DelaRosso, all of the councilors, and for your public service, and the mayor, hopefully,

727
00:52:48,403 --> 00:52:53,205
[SPEAKER_02]: make some betterments to our city, at least keep the status quo from deteriorating any further.

728
00:52:54,006 --> 00:52:55,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish you all success.

729
00:52:58,348 --> 00:53:14,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And knowing at times that you offer condolences for deceased citizens, if I may, I'd like to mention the passing of Barbara Anderson and

730
00:53:14,738 --> 00:53:17,320
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in the Boston Globe, front page of the Sunday Globe.

731
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:17,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it here.

732
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,462
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just read the headline because it's a long story.

733
00:53:21,343 --> 00:53:31,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Barbara Anderson, the force of nature who took down Texas dies, shook up the state, reveling in her controversial role.

734
00:53:33,872 --> 00:53:43,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say, uh, she brought us prop two and a half, as most of you know, for all Massachusetts homeowners.

735
00:53:45,499 --> 00:53:52,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And she is our only hero to try to limit real estate tax increases.

736
00:53:53,142 --> 00:53:55,143
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a perfect Prop 2.5.

737
00:53:56,923 --> 00:54:06,907
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can get off my notation area, Prop 2.5 implies that although the levy can only go up 2.5%, and what about the new growth?

738
00:54:07,227 --> 00:54:08,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not that smart.

739
00:54:09,308 --> 00:54:09,748
[SPEAKER_02]: However,

740
00:54:12,292 --> 00:54:21,759
[SPEAKER_02]: My real estate tax in the past five years have gone up from four to six to 8% in real tax dollars on the tax bill.

741
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,381
[SPEAKER_02]: So prop two and a half.

742
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,343
[SPEAKER_02]: In my limited education, it is a fallacy.

743
00:54:26,983 --> 00:54:29,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we can improve upon her legacy.

744
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:38,212
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm allowed, I'll take my own moment of silence, and I wish her the best, because she's a anti-tax hero.

745
00:54:38,432 --> 00:54:40,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for listening, good luck.

746
00:55:04,854 --> 00:55:06,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Knight, all those in favour?

747
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:08,098
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

748
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:08,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
