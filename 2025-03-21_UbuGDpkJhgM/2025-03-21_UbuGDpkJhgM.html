    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=166.767s">On</a>  the motion for approval, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=168.608s">Second?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=169.508s">Second,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=171.67s">By</a>  Councilor Caraviello on that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=173.391s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=174.992s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=176.33s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=176.93s">Congratulations</a>  and welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=178.431s">We're</a>  glad to have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=179.991s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=181.732s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to take from unfinished business number 15-734 loan order addition to the DPW facility project fund of $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=194.597s">This</a>  motion began its journey with us on November 10th in 2015 after being tabled and referred to committee a number of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=205.689s">It</a>  finally passed its first reading this past March, second reading on March 31st, and now is eligible for a third and final reading on today, April 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=216.412s">So</a>  the Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=218.613s">Mr.</a>  President, yes, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=220.633s">As</a>  noted, this matter has been before the Council a couple of occasions prior. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=224.714s">It's</a>  relative to some surveying problems that were had with the Winthrop Street drainage project. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=230.316s">It's</a>  my understanding that <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=231.829s">There</a>  is litigation subrogation that's in place relatively. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=234.65s">Am</a>  I looking at the right one? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=235.611s">No,</a>  I'm not looking at the right one.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=237.992s">This</a>  is the DPW facility.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=240.053s">This</a>  is the DPW facility.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=242.334s">We</a>  just had to tie the up. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=244.075s">There</a>  was an underestimate on some. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=245.716s">It</a>  was underestimated.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=246.616s">It</a>  was underestimated on the mitigation for the pollution underground, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=249.577s">Yes,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=250.958s">And</a>  we've passed a couple of readings on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=253.199s">And</a>  I would move for approval on the third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=254.64s">It</a>  has to get paid one way or the other, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=256.301s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=257.381s">So</a>  on a motion for approval by Councilor Knight, <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=259.452s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=260.952s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=262.553s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=264.753s">Uh,</a>  thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=266.633s">Uh,</a>  this, this is the issue that I've had a concern with, uh, for, uh, a number of months now regarding, um, the original estimate that the city hired, uh, an outside consultant to come in and give us an estimate on the contaminants at the DPW yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=287.857s">And,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=289.562s">The</a>  estimate was off by, I believe it was $500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=294.203s">The</a>  estimate was off by $500,000, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=300.664s">And</a>  I know we had many discussions with Louise.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=304.745s">The</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=305.125s">We</a>  have before us Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=306.026s">Louise</a>  Miller, the Director of Budget and Finance, who can answer any of our questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=311.747s">As</a>  she's answered many of them already.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=313.227s">Oh,</a>  she's answered them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=314.347s">And</a>  I am in opposition of this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=317.355s">And</a>  I want to explain why, for the viewing audience, Mr. President, that I feel... If it's too comcastic tonight, it will be viewable.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=325.861s">That's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=327.782s">And</a>  I want to explain my position, why I'm opposed to this, for the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=333.387s">The</a>  city went out and hired a consultant to come in and provide the city with facts and figures on what it would cost to remove the contaminants at the DPW yard and to be off by $500,000 on a project that was originally estimated at, what was the amount?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=353.877s">It</a>  was just about $500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=354.617s">It</a>  was about $500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=354.957s">So</a>  they were off by $500,000.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=355.778s">So</a>  the project ended up costing us <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=363.191s">a</a>  million dollars, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=365.573s">And</a>  I'm not sure what would we pay this outside consultant.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=372.118s">It</a>  was around $150,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=373.098s">I</a>  don't have the exact.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=375.0s">So</a>  we paid $150,000 to an outside consultant to ask or to let us know what it was gonna cost to remove the contaminants. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=383.406s">They</a>  said 500,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=385.125s">We</a>  started the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=386.925s">It</a>  was closer to $1 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=388.886s">So</a>  we lost $500,000 on that, and we paid $150,000 for a consultant that gave us bogus information. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=396.127s">So</a>  it's actually $650,000 in net, which I have a real problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=403.149s">And</a>  I realize that the remedial treatment of what was under there may have differed based on what they found and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=414.819s">I</a>  have a tough time thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=418.362s">It's</a>  almost like being a meteorologist. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=420.463s">You</a>  can be right 50 percent of the time, and you're doing a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=425.387s">And</a>  I don't understand why we'd pay a consultant to come in over $100,000 and be off by 100 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=434.053s">It</a>  just doesn't sound right to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=437.515s">And</a>  for those particular reasons, I cannot support this particular funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=443.443s">for</a>  the cleanup, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=445.726s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks, for your frankness. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=448.428s">So</a>  we have a motion for a pull by Councilor Knight, a seconded by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=454.995s">So</a>  on that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=458.038s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=458.858s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=459.599s">Councilor</a>  Falco? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=460.34s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=461.181s">Councilor</a>  Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=462.622s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=469.123s">Yes,</a>  with six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=475.631s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=476.952s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=477.713s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=478.374s">Loan</a>  order passes.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=479.698s">Thank</a>  you, councilors.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=480.758s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=481.239s">Miller.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=482.159s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to take up item number 16-309, again, an item eligible for third reading, amended ordinance on outdoor dining. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=495.244s">After</a>  much consideration, we took this up at tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=498.686s">It</a>  is eligible for its third and final reading tonight, April 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=503.308s">So</a>  on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=508.545s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=509.366s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President, it's my understanding that this is just a simple clarification of the existing outdoor dining license ordinance that's in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=517.233s">There</a>  was some misinterpretation of the legislative intent that's been addressed through the language in this newly crafted zoning ordinance, and I move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=526.522s">On</a>  the motion for approval, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=530.513s">I</a>  just wanted to thank the subcommittee that was sent to, Councilor Knight, and under his leadership on that subcommittee, they vetted this even further, the paper that we received from the administration, and I wanted to thank that subcommittee for their due diligence on this.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=606.768s">While</a>  we're on the suspension, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=608.789s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=612.106s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=613.687s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=616.168s">I</a>  received a number of e-mails regarding some of the work that are being done at local parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=622.171s">And</a>  I made a phone call and talked to Mike Nesta, the park foreman, and he provided me with a list of parks that are in the process of being rehabbed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=635.098s">And</a>  I thought it was quite interesting, and I'm not sure maybe other members of the council are aware, <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=640.368s">There</a>  was some linkage money approved last year for the rehab of several parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=647.87s">Morrison</a>  Park is undergoing right now new tennis courts, new basketball courts, and fencing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=655.252s">Harris</a>  Park, if you go by Harris Park, the old tennis court and the basketball court is totally leveled now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=662.054s">It's</a>  just dirt, and they're getting a new basketball court and a new tennis court, as well as fencing around that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=668.824s">Dugger</a>  Park is receiving two new steel basketball backboards in their courts, which appear to be in good shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=677.648s">And</a>  Victory Park had some work done to clean some of the brush and debris along the fencing of Victory Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=688.673s">So</a>  that work, from what I understand, is underway and within the next month or two will be completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=697.136s">So</a>  hopefully for this summer, <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=699.074s">We'll</a>  have, at least for these parks, updated tennis courts and basketball courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=703.937s">And</a>  the tennis courts, we're having a revitalization in Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=707.999s">Tennis</a>  is really on the rise in this community, and the demand for tennis courts is really sought after.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=718.384s">And</a>  the addition of these- The sport of royalty, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=721.705s">Well,</a>  maybe that's why there's such a demand in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=725.807s">But</a>  the tennis courts, <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=729.567s">that</a>  were, I know at Harris Park, were in deplorable shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=733.829s">Actually,</a>  there were no nets, so I guess you could say they were worse than deplorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=737.53s">But</a>  it's going to add to this community having a lot of other options to play tennis in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=745.614s">So</a>  I want to thank the administration, and I know the council president also has a vote on linkage. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=750.596s">Thank</a>  the council president, because this is well needed.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=755.198s">Thank</a>  you for bringing that up, Councilor Markswell. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=757.303s">So</a>  on the motion of Council Knight to return to the regular order of business, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=816.713s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=817.394s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Marks, wishing congratulations to Frank and Charlotte Scuderi on the wonderful occasion of their 50th wedding anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=826.759s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=828.199s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=828.34s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=829.14s">The</a>  motion carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=830.261s">And</a>  now to return to the regular order of business offered by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=834.783s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=836.024s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=836.924s">The</a>  motion carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=839.633s">380</a>  offered by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=841.934s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Metro City Council request the Department of Public Works or Park Department to try to clean and polish several war memorial monuments and plaques around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=851.858s">With</a>  Patriot's Day and Memorial Day approaching, many visitors from around the area come and visit the monuments.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=858.841s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=860.562s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=861.662s">Mr.</a>  President, being on the Veterans Committee, I get a lot of calls in regards to some of our memorials. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=868.79s">Um,</a>  if you, in fact, if the one that got me started on this was, uh, the people from, uh, from Pennsylvania will be coming up this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=876.817s">Uh,</a>  her grandfather was a seventh year, seventh generation on the, on the plaque of the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=883.302s">And</a>  it's, you know, over the years it's oxidized and it's tarnished and the rock could be cleaned. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=889.206s">And</a>  at one time there used to be a couple of trees there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=891.788s">Um,</a>  I had somebody go down that knows about, uh, plaques. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=896.572s">and</a>  things like that, and they said that the plaques, they're the old plaques, and they need to be actually taken off and refinished, because they can't be cleaned. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=905.314s">But</a>  he says, if you set up your power washer, you might get a little bit cleaner. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=908.675s">If</a>  we could maybe have the parks and departments go around them and do some of the, I know we have multiple memorials around the city, different parks and plaques, and maybe the mayor may have some funding to get these plaques refinished over the next couple of years, to bring them up to life again. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=927.065s">So</a>  it's something that if the mayor could maybe have the parks department or the public works, maybe they can power wash the area and maybe get some of the oxidation off to make them look nice for the holidays coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=939.211s">On</a>  that motion.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=940.252s">When</a>  I was a novice monk up at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=942.853s">Anselm's</a>  College, there were two bronze statues on campus and we used to have to go out twice a year and polish them with bowling alley wax.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=951.798s">And</a>  that's what protected the bronze. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=953.933s">Mr.</a>  President, we thought, I was talking with Mr. Lindsey at the veteran's office, and we thought it might have been a project that the vocational school kids might have been able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=964.676s">But</a>  I'm informed that those plaques won't come clean even with acid or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=973.298s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=974.518s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=975.418s">Mr.</a>  President, first of all, I'd like to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=979.259s">He's</a>  done a great job on behalf of the veterans here in the community since this election. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=983.647s">He</a>  served diligently as the Chairman of the Veterans Services Subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=987.531s">With</a>  that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper and ask that the Director of Veterans Service provide us with a list of all veteran, war, and military monuments, memorials, and plaques in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=997.722s">And</a>  I'd also like to ask the Director of Veterans Services if he can establish a maintenance schedule for said war, memorial, <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1006.384s">monuments</a>  and plaques that are across the city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1008.966s">I</a>  think that this is something that should fall within the purview of our Director of Veteran Services. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1012.208s">I</a>  think that he should be the one that's really taking the lead on this, and that he's the one that's helping coordinate this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1017.051s">So</a>  with that being said, I move for approval as amended.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1020.153s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as seconded and amended by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1026.137s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1026.578s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1027.418s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could also amend my motion, I forgot to, but the war memorial that is at Winthrop Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1034.964s">It's</a>  been brought to my attention there's a couple of lights out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1039.627s">If</a>  someone could take care of the couple of lights that are out there, it would be appreciated.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1045.85s">So</a>  further amended by Councilor Caraviello that the electrical department examine and replace any defective and or out lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1056.777s">So</a>  on that motion, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1059.198s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1059.358s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1060.119s">The</a>  motion carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1062.32s">16-381</a>  offered by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1064.56s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council commended and congratulate Century Bank's Marshal Sloan on the celebration of his 90th birthday.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1544.637s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1548.018s">I</a>  received a call from somebody who was upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1550.439s">It</a>  sounds like they made a call and asked what streets were getting swept when, and they were told they can find that information only on the website, and it didn't seem like it was posted anywhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1562.217s">This</a>  person was upset, didn't have a computer. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1564.618s">And</a>  I agree with the complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1568.559s">So</a>  I wanted to just make sure that when we do have any notices that need to go out to the public, I think it's wonderful that we are utilizing our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1578.483s">And</a>  I think the transparency is so much better than it ever has been. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1582.544s">But</a>  I would just also request that we be posting things in the paper, making actual posts, whether it be at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1591.967s">on</a>  documents, on billboards, at the library, and any other means of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1597.031s">And</a>  that if there is a certain post that needs to be made on the website, that certain departments know that if somebody calls and asks questions, that they can be answered that way, too, verbally. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1609.861s">Because</a>  some people don't have a computer, some people don't have phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1612.503s">So</a>  I just want to make sure information is getting out by many means of communication rather than just <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1618.272s">directing</a>  everybody to the website, because some people actually do go to the library to do all their computer work, and you can't get there all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1625.038s">So</a>  I think that's very important just to bring up, because the resident that did call me was very, very upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1630.122s">And</a>  I just want to make sure we're accommodating to, you know, everybody.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1729.62s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1730.901s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello actually brought this very issue up several weeks ago asking what was going on with that steel plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1737.907s">And</a>  the response that we received back from the DPW was that it's a catch basin that has been plated because it has collapsed and is scheduled to be repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1744.872s">Well,</a>  today as I was driving home from the office, I did notice that the <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1748.536s">steel</a>  plate is about six to eight inches off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1752.918s">Puddles</a>  pooling, Mr. President, due to the weather conditions, and it just needs a little bit of an adjustment so that it makes the situation a little bit safer there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1759.941s">I</a>  think part of the problem is the fact that it's very close to a bus stop, and when the bus pulls over, it stops right next to the plate and then drives over the plate and adjusts it due to the weight of the vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1769.506s">So</a>  with that being said, I'd ask that this matter be approved by the Council and forwarded to the DPW.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1774.252s">All</a>  the motion approved by Councilor Knight, all those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1776.694s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1777.594s">Carries.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1778.335s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1779.896s">Be</a>  it resolved that speeding cars on Forest Street be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1783.358s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1785.679s">Speeding</a>  cars.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1787.2s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1788.601s">I</a>  received an email from a resident on Roosevelt Road, which we all know is the road when you're coming right off of Roosevelt Circle, the first road on the right-hand side. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1801.549s">And</a>  residents are very concerned <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1804.235s">that</a>  cars coming off of Roosevelt Circle are coming down Forest Street and they're really coming at a great clip. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1812.039s">And</a>  residents are concerned that have children in the area and want some additional signage along that portion of Forest Street and possibly to look at maybe a raised crosswalk in the area to slow down some of the traffic coming off that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1831.231s">So</a>  I would want to offer that as a resolution tonight asking that the Traffic Commission look into increased speeding signage at Roosevelt Road and Forest Street and also Roosevelt Circle and that the possibility of a raised crosswalk or any other traffic calming approaches in that particular area, which is posing a real safety concern for area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1860.248s">be</a>  discussed by the Traffic Commission.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1863.631s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1864.211s">Thank</a>  you for your efforts in public safety on that matter.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1866.753s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1868.514s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1869.295s">If</a>  Councilor Marks wouldn't object, if we could add Governors Avenue onto that list also. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1873.838s">I've</a>  received numerous calls from many residents on Governors Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1878.141s">Same</a>  problem, cars speeding on both sides of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1881.243s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Caraviello, Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1884.701s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd like to thank Councilman Knox for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1888.944s">On</a>  two occasions, this council has approved resolutions to put a crosswalk at Forest Street between King Ave and Cedar Road to allow safe crossing of Forest Street to the newly renovated McNally Playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1903.695s">And</a>  I'd ask that we amend the paper to receive an update on the status thereof, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1908.399s">On</a>  the motion to, on the amendment of Councilor Knight, Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1914.57s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1916.211s">If</a>  I could also amend this paper with regards to the traffic calming approaches, we always ask that the speedometer be placed at different locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1924.619s">And</a>  I think the last update we got, I don't know if I personally got it or if the entire council got it, was that the speedometer machine was out of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1933.827s">So</a>  if we could just get an update on that and a cost estimate to fix that machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1941.526s">so</a>  that we can maybe evaluate it at budget time, because I think that's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1945.008s">I</a>  know enforcement is, you know, it's hard to enforce every road. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1949.851s">I've</a>  complained about Harvard, Forest. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1951.753s">I</a>  mean, we each are complaining about different streets at different times. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1954.735s">So</a>  that's a huge speed calming approach that I think is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1959.638s">And</a>  we only had one, and from what I understand, it's broken.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1963.14s">And</a>  where it's been used, it's been very effective.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=1966.082s">It</a>  is very effective, yes.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2093.584s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2095.145s">I</a>  had the distinct honor and pleasure of working for Senator Shannon, as did Councilor Marks, as well as Councilor Caraviello's son, Richard. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2102.29s">And</a>  I just think that it would be fitting and quite a tribute to the service and dedication that this gentleman gave the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the citizens of this district over his 20 plus years as a state senator and his 20 years before that as a law enforcement officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2117.371s">Senator</a>  Shannon died of cancer back in 2005. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2122.072s">He</a>  gave me a shot right out of college as an intern, and I ended up becoming a member of his staff and worked with him from 1999 until his untimely passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2130.094s">He's</a>  sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2130.914s">He's</a>  made a great deal of change and effectuated the number of people's lives in a positive way in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2137.715s">I</a>  think it's only fitting that we remember and reflect upon the contributions that he's made to the citizens of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2144.832s">On</a>  that motion, if you would all rise and join us in a moment of silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2160.64s">Before</a>  we return to the regular order of business, two items. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2166.263s">First</a>  of all, next week on Monday, April 18th, is Memorial Day, Patriot's Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2174.588s">And,</a>  uh, so the annual celebrations will take place starting this year at 10 o'clock at the, uh, old burial ground on Salem street, uh, at 10 45, we'll gather in front of the Gaffey funeral home, the Isaac Hall house at the corner of, um, uh, high and Bradley. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2194.281s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2194.621s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2195.842s">And,</a>  uh, wait to welcome Paul Revere, all the welcome plenty of activities, plenty of music, <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2202.696s">song</a>  activities for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2204.957s">And</a>  so we hope to have everybody there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2208.299s">Secondly,</a>  Barbara Kerr has been appointed as a librarian for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2214.422s">Congratulations</a>  to Barbara and thanks to her and all the many, uh, dedications that she's given to the improvement of the Medford public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2224.847s">Before</a>  we go back to the regular order of business, did councilor Caraviello want to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2228.308s">Did</a>  madam vice president want to speak?</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2358.508s">For</a>  example, we make $500 off of one rental for the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2364.729s">Two</a>  rentals at $500 even starts to sound better. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2370.89s">The</a>  same could be said for the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2372.831s">When</a>  does it stop? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2375.359s">then</a>  the infighting of who gets what time and for what price. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2380.201s">These</a>  buildings are not businesses, and they were not designed to be businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2386.383s">We</a>  have a breach of the Constitution with the Chevalier by renting it to religious groups, and we have a breach of security by renting a child-rich environment to strange adults in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2398.468s">The</a>  library needs to become fresh with a new concept for the millennial generation and the generation that is following. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2404.992s">The</a>  Chevalier is a gift from heaven that most communities would die for, yet we have to rent it to religious groups to keep the doors open. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2414.077s">Well,</a>  if those two buildings aren't enough, we have money available through the community access station. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2419.861s">It's</a>  the goose that lays the golden eggs. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2422.943s">The</a>  money is not produced through the tax base, but our cable bills, but gives generously towards both the general fund and the arts community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2434.408s">The</a>  city apparently still has a bad taste in its mouth from the last community access station. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2440.572s">But</a>  this city's arts community is going to have to step up and do something with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2446.917s">Don't</a>  ask for money when money is sitting in unused accounts just because it is hard to work out the details. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2460.366s">I</a>  have news for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2461.527s">Life</a>  is hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2463.733s">This</a>  city is missing out on recording its history, sports, arts, news, and culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2468.757s">You,</a>  the arts community, with your infighting, are not stepping up to the plate you have been assigned to by virtue of your talents and status in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2478.284s">It</a>  may not be popular, but it needs to be said. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2481.006s">Many</a>  of you enjoy the Boys and Girls Club in the basement of the Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2484.729s">Why</a>  not put the Boys and Girls Club in a school, a designated kid's space, and release that basement for a community space <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2493.004s">or</a>  the community access station. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2496.167s">And</a>  now, you have the community preservation fund, which many of you thought was a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2503.912s">I</a>  now count that on your ledger for the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2507.515s">You</a>  have three existing entities to express yourselves through. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2511.819s">Come</a>  together and maximize what we already have. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2514.881s">Don't</a>  ask for yet another building when we are neglecting the ones we have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2519.722s">The</a>  West Medford Community Center and the South Medford Fire Station have community space available for meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2526.407s">Point</a>  of fact, Springstep, a non-profit in this city designed for the arts, went out of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2532.152s">It</a>  folded. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2533.973s">Why</a>  should we create yet another building for the arts when we have two already, and three with a TV station in the square? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2542.54s">Plus,</a>  the pot of money you just created through the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2546.332s">Use</a>  what we have, build on them, and be grateful you have what you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2551.034s">I</a>  am. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2552.914s">And</a>  for my blue-collar and pink-collar fellow citizens, you're not off the hook either. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2557.916s">You</a>  all were up here demanding bonding for new sports arenas and got every one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2562.898s">You</a>  got the swimming pool, Hormel, and the Field of Dreams by borrowing into your kids' future. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2569.5s">While</a>  it is easy to pick on the new primarily white-collar class moving in, <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2573.897s">I</a>  don't see you all asking for bonding for police cruisers, asphalt for the roads, or demanding the water sewer money be spent on water pipe replacement right under our feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2583.624s">The</a>  blue and pink collar people in this city have been looking out for what they value too, which are sports and recreational facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2592.03s">While</a>  everyone can get behind kids, these facilities are also luxuries, though you may not see it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2598.414s">We</a>  need to focus on building maintenance in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2601.196s">I</a>  know, I know, it's a deep sleeper. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2603.827s">but</a>  it has to get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2608.95s">This</a>  city is not making the mayor's job any easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2612.973s">She</a>  knows full well what needs to be done in Medford and where the financial resources need to go, but she hears from you with your hands out, we want more, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2623.999s">We</a>  all need to accept that government money is not a part of endless cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2629.603s">You</a>  want it all, but I have news for everyone, you can't have it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2633.643s">Start</a>  applying pressure on the mayor to take care of the buildings we currently own, including the schools, which I know you all care about, blue-collar, no-collar, and white-collar alike. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2644.271s">To</a>  the white-collar newcomer, please realize you have more disposable income than others in this city, and those without your excess dollars become resentful of you because you are increasing their standard of living, actually pushing them out of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2659.835s">They</a>  resent you because you have the luxury of being able to think beyond the necessities of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2666.297s">And</a>  for you blue-collar guys, I don't see you protesting in the streets for systematic reform of the way business is done here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2673.08s">It</a>  is time you, too, step up. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2675.661s">Stand</a>  out in Medford Square with a sign for scheduled systematic street sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2680.522s">You</a>  can't, can you? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2681.923s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2682.903s">Because</a>  how can the DPW do its job if the streets are littered with cars? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2688.255s">The</a>  working class has priorities, too, that do not always coincide with the city's ability to take care of itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2695.697s">It</a>  is easy for everyone to get behind kids, and parks are important, but they are not the only need in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2701.778s">Start</a>  thinking about what doesn't automatically pop into your head. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2705.699s">Sports</a>  facilities are not mandated by government, and you, too, should appreciate what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2711.581s">I</a>  know many of you want to tell me to go pound sand right now, but someone has to speak truth to power. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2717.955s">The</a>  city is slowly receding, in spite of the spike in property values. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2722.896s">The</a>  city's diagnosis is in, but the remedy is painful to all. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2727.237s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2730.017s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2730.537s">Maher.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2731.497s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to receive and place on file, Councilor Marx.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2735.638s">Just</a>  if I could, I want to thank Jean for her comments, and many of them hit home because they're true. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2743.6s">The</a>  one thing I do want to mention, I think it was two weeks ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2746.671s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn offered a resolution to find out from the administration how people can apply for the exemption for the Community Preservation Act, and we didn't receive a response, as I know from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2762.438s">And</a>  last week I offered something very similar that the administration, because a letter went out in the tax bill alerting people of the Community Preservation Act, but there was never any discussion <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2775.387s">about</a>  how to apply for an exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2778.169s">And</a>  to date, we have not received on two separate — dating now 14 days — two separate resolves dealing with the exemption for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2789.717s">And</a>  it's one thing, Mr. President, that this was voted on, and, you know, the people are going to have to pay the additional 1.5 percent surcharge. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2798.104s">But</a>  it's another thing not to alert people that may be eligible for an exemption <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2803.645s">that</a>  could surely use it, that this is available, and how to apply for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2809.51s">So,</a>  again, I would ask, Mr. President, that we receive a correspondence from the mayor and that the citizenry be notified on how to apply for an exemption for the Community Preservation Act and what are the eligibility requirements based on state law.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2831.938s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight, to receive the paper from the petitioner and place it on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2841.086s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2842.167s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2843.228s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Marks, I'm to suspension for an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2848.953s">And</a>  with those fine points, Mr. Clerk, to hear a report back from the administrator. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2854.417s">On</a>  those two resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2855.679s">On</a>  those two resolutions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2858.155s">Council</a>  Vice President Longo-Kerr.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2860.337s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2861.958s">I</a>  just want to second that because when I brought it up two weeks ago, from what I understood, there was only about one more week to apply for an exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2870.485s">So</a>  if that was the case, then it's almost too late to apply for an exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2874.828s">So</a>  I think one of my points, and I think the council agreed with the resolution, is that we extend that time for an exemption because I wholeheartedly agree that there's an exemption portion in this law for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2887.293s">There</a>  are people out there that need an exemption, financially, obviously, for financial reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2893.598s">So</a>  they should be aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2896.22s">Like</a>  I said earlier in tonight's meeting, we should be not only posting information on the exemption online, we should be posting it at the library and in the paper so that people who need an exemption can apply for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2907.77s">And</a>  I really pray that the administration extends that time frame if for some reason it has passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2913.978s">to</a>  give the residents that have no idea about the exemption or how to apply for it the time they need to research it and figure out if they can apply for it and get the exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2924.022s">I</a>  found out from a resident I had no idea with regards to any timelines for exemptions and that they would be coming up so soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2932.646s">So</a>  if us Councilors didn't know, obviously the general public does not know. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2936.788s">And</a>  if you have a senior citizen or somebody who can apply for this exemption, <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2941.866s">had</a>  no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2942.746s">I</a>  think that's highly unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2944.907s">And</a>  I just truly believe and really hope that the administration will do the right thing and extend that time frame and give it at least another month with advertisement and with notification to our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2958.331s">We</a>  use the 911 system. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2960.032s">I</a>  think there's now a Facebook page or Where's Barry Clemente? <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2963.873s">You</a>  know, people are used to hearing from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2966.554s">So</a>  I think a reverse call needs to go out with regards to when this exemption <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2971.806s">date</a>  is coming and what they need to do to apply for it and get more information on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2977.25s">So</a>  I really hope that that happens.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2986.357s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2987.098s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=2987.898s">It's</a>  my understanding of the language that was adopted here in the city of Medford that there are a number of exemptions, but there's one big exemption and that's the automatic exemption for the $100,000 off your <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=3000.728s">And</a>  that, I believe, is an exemption that you don't need to apply for. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=3002.909s">That's</a>  an automatic exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=3004.13s">So</a>  if your home is valued at $300,000, you have an automatic exemption on the first $100,000, and then the assessment will be leveled on to the $200,000 figure. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=3013.456s">So</a>  I wanted to be clear that there's no application process for the initial $100,000 exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbuGDpkJhgM&t=3019.4s">That's</a>  an automatic exemption that's applicable to everybody.</p>
