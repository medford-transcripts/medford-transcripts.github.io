00:00:22,137 --> 00:00:26,521
Hello, everyone, and welcome to your show, MedFed Happenings.

2
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:28,262
I am John Petrella.

3
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:48,260
Today's show features Roy Belson and Danielle Marcelino, who will be addressing truth, facts, and information about the upcoming override questions in MedFed, which are questions six, seven, and eight.

4
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:57,629
Tonight we have video presentations by Roy and Danielle from an all-Meffitt meeting that I attended.

5
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:07,693
This was recorded and produced by Joe DiMaio at Joe DiMaio Creative, and I want to thank you, Joe, for helping us out with those.

6
00:01:09,434 --> 00:01:17,498
Roy Belson is a professional with decades of experience as the superintendent of the Meffitt public school system.

7
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:26,026
He is highly regarded at the Statehouse, providing guidance for educational strategy and programs.

8
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:33,472
Roy explains the current state and solutions for Medford and our children.

9
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:38,455
He does not support the educational ballot overrides.

10
00:01:40,157 --> 00:01:47,362
Danielle Marcellino is the Medford Firefighters Union Secretary and a firefighter.

11
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,992
She is speaking for the Meffitt Firemen's Union.

12
00:01:52,212 --> 00:02:02,599
Danielle explains the lack of engagement with the firefighters organization in the design and needs for a new fire headquarters.

13
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:11,724
She is going to put Meffitt citizens first and is taking a position to not support the debt exclusion.

14
00:02:13,405 --> 00:02:15,727
We'll show you Roy's presentation first.

15
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:39,187
Followed by Danielle's and let's get right to the videos Tonight

16
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:44,103
We have to thank my team, there's so many of them, but I want to thank everybody that's here.

17
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:45,908
If you're from All-Method, if you could just raise your hand.

18
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:48,534
Just thanking you for being here tonight and helping.

19
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:49,817
Thank you so much.

20
00:02:53,998 --> 00:02:55,018
We've had a few events.

21
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:56,659
I know tonight's a tough, tough night.

22
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:05,121
I know that we had about three different events tonight, but we said we need to do something because things are happening really quick.

23
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:11,602
And the reason that we're here is because we wanted to talk about the Proposition 2.5 override and the debt exclusion.

24
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:14,883
So there are three questions that will be on the ballot.

25
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:20,726
I'll give you some more information later on after a few people speak.

26
00:03:21,346 --> 00:03:28,589
But one is the debt exclusion, which is for a new fire headquarters.

27
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:33,731
I'm very fortunate that we have one of our union leaders from the fire department.

28
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:35,511
Danielle Masolino is going to be here.

29
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:36,632
She's going to speak in a little while.

30
00:03:37,252 --> 00:03:44,855
And proud to say someone that I called and asked his opinion because I think he is probably the

31
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:50,277
the smartest educational mind, at least in Massachusetts.

32
00:03:50,558 --> 00:03:51,698
He's someone that I respect.

33
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:57,001
And sad to say, I don't think people respect him enough until that person's gone.

34
00:03:57,601 --> 00:04:01,283
But I called this gentleman and I asked him some questions.

35
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:08,687
And within five minutes, you just feel better because he just educates you with his knowledge.

36
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:13,270
And I asked him if he can come out and spend a Friday night to come out and speak and

37
00:04:14,327 --> 00:04:37,212
give his opinion and what, you know, his perspective as an educational leader, someone that ran our school system for many, many years, still works at the state level, high level at the state, and he's gonna share some of his knowledge, and then we'll fill in some gaps that people had that had some questions, and we can help educate everybody so they understand what this means on November 7th.

38
00:04:37,252 --> 00:04:40,813
So right now, I'd like to introduce my friend Roy Belson.

39
00:04:42,612 --> 00:04:43,633
Nice to see everybody.

40
00:04:43,713 --> 00:04:46,656
Thank you for giving me an opportunity to say a few things.

41
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:54,543
And hopefully, what I express will help you understand what's going on.

42
00:04:56,364 --> 00:05:06,573
Obviously, I'm here to share my perspectives and my thoughts about the upcoming questions on the November ballot, especially those that affect public education.

43
00:05:07,756 --> 00:05:26,082
So while I'm no longer the superintendent of schools, I'm in my seventh year of retirement or semi-retirement, I still stay very aware of education items, both in the community, the state, nation, and it's very enlightening to see what people are doing around the commonwealth.

44
00:05:26,922 --> 00:05:32,624
I spent 50 years in Medford public education, 23 years as superintendent,

45
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:41,332
And I also served at different times as the budget director, the curriculum director, and the personnel administrator, as well as a teacher.

46
00:05:42,453 --> 00:05:45,575
So I care deeply about what happens in our schools and our community.

47
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:49,538
I'm not here tonight to criticize the school administration.

48
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:50,979
I know how hard they work.

49
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,721
I know the challenges that they face.

50
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:58,164
And I know that some of the things are beyond their control.

51
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:14,462
I have always believed, and I still do, that schools deserve solid levels of funding and that the budget process must promote and support quality programming, stability, and predictability.

52
00:06:15,523 --> 00:06:19,083
Budget development must be resourceful and creative.

53
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:25,564
It should not be a destabilizing force, exercise, and create uncertainty and conflict.

54
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:28,025
And I think that's what's happened in the last couple of years.

55
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:45,505
Yes, there will be from time to time differences among officials, educators, constituents, but at all times, they should be based on the facts, on available resources, best practices, and the needs of students and their families, as well as the community at large.

56
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:55,547
The current override ballot questions, initiatives, and two of them in education, and one, a debt exclusion for the fire department,

57
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,824
Call for, if you will, in the school department, a $7 million hike.

58
00:07:01,364 --> 00:07:04,945
You had a half a million dollars for the DPW at 7.5.

59
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,186
This is a property tax levy.

60
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:17,889
This request is based upon the argument that the school system has been perpetually in a structural deficit, and it's not true.

61
00:07:19,282 --> 00:07:20,764
The pertinent questions are these.

62
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:23,826
Is it true that we're in a deficit?

63
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:26,989
How does Medford compare with other communities around us?

64
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:32,254
Are there good alternatives available to meet our needs?

65
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:38,621
Is this a one-time request or will there be another one, a larger request in the near future?

66
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:40,002
And I think you know the answer to that.

67
00:07:41,143 --> 00:07:44,205
What is the real impact on the Medford taxpayer?

68
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:48,427
And does the voting public truly understand the pros and cons?

69
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:54,451
And has there been sufficient information and time for the public to make an informed decision?

70
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:58,253
So let's take a look and let's consider the following.

71
00:08:00,294 --> 00:08:06,498
The last two years relied heavily on the use of federal ARPA and ESSER funds.

72
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:09,580
They were put out there because of the COVID crisis.

73
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:19,725
It was well known that when these funds were used up, there would be a need for the city to sustain staff and programs with local and state revenues.

74
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:26,809
Otherwise, there would be undesirable cuts to program and personnel.

75
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:30,350
So was this necessary?

76
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:38,274
When the budget process took place in the last year, everybody knew that those funds had to be replaced.

77
00:08:39,264 --> 00:08:48,209
And those funds enabled the city to build up a free cash reserve that is three times what has ever been in place.

78
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,212
Almost at this point in time, $35 million.

79
00:08:52,472 --> 00:08:59,296
And if that was the case, was it necessary?

80
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:06,140
And did the mayor really fail to provide full funding consistent with the school committee's request?

81
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:14,577
when there's a significant amount of free cash available to the city, much higher than the amount available in previous years.

82
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:26,324
The school administration, by law, is required to ask, and the school committee as well, for an amount sufficient to support the schools under Proposition 2 1⁄2.

83
00:09:27,505 --> 00:09:29,166
It's their legal request to do that.

84
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:37,111
The mayor or the city manager in the past, when 2 1⁄2 passed, had the bottom line, and the city council

85
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:41,700
can only approve or cut what the mayor provides.

86
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,360
So it's not simple.

87
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:53,742
The amount of money reported to DOR of free cash was $25 million in 2004.

88
00:09:54,262 --> 00:10:00,824
And as I indicated, they added another $9 million or thereabouts in the current fiscal year.

89
00:10:03,624 --> 00:10:06,425
Why, given the often repeated

90
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,740
mantra of the mayor, transparency.

91
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:14,601
Interesting word.

92
00:10:16,862 --> 00:10:27,765
And the city's financial director, did they fail to provide a clean and complete report on the city's financial position to the city council and the school committee?

93
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:29,565
I think the answer's simple.

94
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:35,627
The answer is that they wanted to leverage a crisis to create

95
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:49,591
a need for an override, because you're in a situation where you don't have it, you're threatening cuts to important services, and if you don't give me the money, we're gonna have to do drastic measures.

96
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:51,771
This is not Proposition 2 1⁄2.

97
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:56,532
In 1981, 1982, I was in the school system.

98
00:10:57,253 --> 00:11:02,694
I was working with the superintendent's office, and the budget of the city of Medford for the schools was $19.4 million.

99
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,749
That year, we had to cut $3.2 million.

100
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:12,270
That's a cut.

101
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,111
150 people got laid off.

102
00:11:15,752 --> 00:11:18,453
That was difficult, very difficult.

103
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,335
We are not in that situation right now.

104
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,256
We are not in that situation.

105
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:30,700
When the 2024 DOR, Department of Revenue Tax Recap Report is studied, and I did that,

106
00:11:31,555 --> 00:11:39,582
There are clear underestimates of revenue amounts when compared with 2023, specifically by almost 15%.

107
00:11:39,622 --> 00:11:53,473
So in other words saying, if investment income was X, it was 14% less when they were projecting their revenue, almost $18 million.

108
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:57,857
Why create a crisis?

109
00:11:59,837 --> 00:12:07,899
Before you ask the public for an override, should you not first use the obvious resources available?

110
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:15,701
You can always go back later on and say, you know, we used up our resources.

111
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,701
But when you have them, why won't you use them?

112
00:12:20,202 --> 00:12:21,442
Let's talk about the tax rate.

113
00:12:23,037 --> 00:12:24,417
The Medford tax rate is low.

114
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:28,979
The residential tax rate is low comparatively to area communities.

115
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:30,339
Nothing wrong with that.

116
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:35,961
I don't think anyone feels like it has to be number one, the highest tax rate in the Commonwealth.

117
00:12:36,661 --> 00:12:41,283
So it's not a bad thing when affordability for housing and other needs is challenging.

118
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:48,765
If the overrides and debt exclusion pass, taxes will increase, I think, by at least 10%.

119
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:57,174
especially when you include the 2.5% statutory increase that happens virtually every year.

120
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:01,457
And what about the impact of re-evaluation?

121
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:03,078
You know what's going on right now.

122
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:04,299
They're checking your houses out.

123
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:10,383
And by the way, if you haven't noticed, your house is worth more than it was when you bought it, in most cases.

124
00:13:11,484 --> 00:13:15,887
And when they reassess it, they're going to reassess it and the taxes are going to go up.

125
00:13:17,668 --> 00:13:20,871
And on top of that, you're probably going to pay a little bit more for water and sewer.

126
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:28,160
And when you add it all together, if you have to take an equity loan, you're gonna pay a hell of a lot more interest than you might like.

127
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:41,608
And if you're a new person wanting to buy a home, the mortgage rates are still at 6.2%, and even if it goes down to 5%, it's a hell of a lot higher than it was when people refinanced a few years ago.

128
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:44,389
And what about renters?

129
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,771
Some of these people will never have a chance.

130
00:13:49,392 --> 00:13:50,473
They just won't be able to

131
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:57,640
to get in and the landlords are going to pass on the rent to their tenants.

132
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:00,361
So, that affects people too.

133
00:14:01,222 --> 00:14:06,425
When you think about it, there's also a deduction, tax deduction limit.

134
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:11,908
You used to be able to take your income tax and your house property tax and interest.

135
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:14,049
You can't do that anymore in the current rule.

136
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:19,112
So, you can't even deduct some of the stuff that you used to be able to do before.

137
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:21,213
Some people can get around it for various reasons,

138
00:14:21,998 --> 00:14:22,658
Not everybody.

139
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:30,741
If you look at the age factor in the community, 22% of Medford residents are over the age of 60.

140
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:36,663
14% are 70 or more.

141
00:14:36,803 --> 00:14:39,124
A lot of these people are on fixed incomes.

142
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:42,686
They don't have another alternative to go to.

143
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:47,968
And they're probably supporting their children, their grandchildren, and everything else like that as well.

144
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:50,929
So a hit like this is really significant.

145
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:08,513
By the way, as the high school project moves forward, and it's in a planning stage right now, undoubtedly there will be another override request, which isn't out there right now.

146
00:15:09,073 --> 00:15:12,114
That'll make three override requests.

147
00:15:12,594 --> 00:15:19,276
The two that are there now, and the one that might come up, plus the debt exclusion, in the very near future.

148
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:22,737
Given the cost of a rebuild,

149
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:29,245
or renovation, this will be the biggest number that you've ever seen.

150
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:35,407
The SBA reimbursement rate is not known at this time.

151
00:15:36,307 --> 00:15:37,827
It will only cover certain costs.

152
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:38,988
Not everything is eligible.

153
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:51,972
If you look at high schools that have been built or renovated in recent times, you're talking somewhere in the vicinity of $200 million to $400 million to redo the high school.

154
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:57,192
We've got vocational shops and other things like that that have to be preserved.

155
00:15:59,114 --> 00:16:00,394
That's an expensive thing.

156
00:16:00,454 --> 00:16:13,103
And if you maybe get 35, 40%, not getting the 90% that we got for the schools, the K through 12 schools that we got several years ago with Rick as the chairperson of the building committee at that time.

157
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:18,566
And we, by the way, sold the old schools so that we actually made money.

158
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:19,807
Don't tell anybody.

159
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,971
You don't get that now.

160
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:34,378
So you're gonna be talking about potentially 100 to $200 million of local assessment over and above.

161
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:42,785
That will impact taxes on top of the early override assessments.

162
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:48,429
And by the way, if the override passes in November,

163
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:54,564
you will see the increase on your January 2025 tax bill.

164
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:58,326
You're not gonna wait a year to build it up.

165
00:16:58,386 --> 00:16:59,527
You're gonna see it in January.

166
00:17:00,307 --> 00:17:01,368
It's only a few months away.

167
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:10,033
Now one of the arguments that comes around is that somehow Medford salaries and cost per pupil are not competitive.

168
00:17:11,054 --> 00:17:16,737
Now as a educator, I think I started off with this, I want every nickel I can get for the schools.

169
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:25,324
I mean, I'd be less than honest if I didn't tell you that I think the schools deserve every nickel we can give them, and we have plenty of needs.

170
00:17:26,565 --> 00:17:32,567
But no one gets everything they want, and no school system is able to do that, and no community is able to do that.

171
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:36,288
Well, let's take a look at the Medford Public Schools financials.

172
00:17:37,268 --> 00:17:42,110
And this is according to the latest Department of Elementary and Secondary Education statistics.

173
00:17:43,243 --> 00:17:45,665
The state average per pupil is $19,714.

174
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:47,666
Medford is currently spending $21,372.

175
00:17:47,706 --> 00:17:48,347
Arlington is spending $18,615.

176
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:50,488
Malden is spending $17,428.

177
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:51,989
Melrose is spending $15,540.

178
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:15,150
Peabody is spending $16,996, and I can go on and on.

179
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:24,999
Now, someone can say, well, there are, Mystic Valley, by the way, one of the charter schools that sucks away dollars from our budget, is paying, is spending $14,167.

180
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,162
Now, there are places, Somerville 23958, we just built a building so you can see where,

181
00:18:37,277 --> 00:18:37,837
that's involved.

182
00:18:38,237 --> 00:18:41,278
And by the way, if you want to chase Cambridge, Cambridge is spending $36,712.

183
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:47,980
Of course, Cambridge has got a property base that's incredible.

184
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:49,721
And Burlington is $25,297.

185
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:58,323
And by the way, if we were still sending kids to Minuteman, the cost would be $34,176.

186
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:12,712
And if we continued to send 50 kids there like we did when we cut it off, we'd be pushing $2 million a year of money out of our pocket.

187
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:15,574
And that's why we rebuilt the vocational school.

188
00:19:15,594 --> 00:19:18,615
And people argued about, why are you not sending the kids to Minuteman?

189
00:19:19,476 --> 00:19:21,217
Because they're sucking dollars out of Medford.

190
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:27,400
And we had a right to rebuild our own school and run our own programs at a far less cost.

191
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:31,748
So, then the question comes about teacher salaries.

192
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:32,668
Where's Charlene?

193
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:33,249
Charlene?

194
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:35,911
All right, Charlene, don't take offense.

195
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:38,854
Okay.

196
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:47,843
If you look at the average salary for the Medford teachers, average salary, and this is latest numbers, you know, obviously it's gone up a little bit.

197
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,664
The average salary is $88,179.

198
00:19:49,704 --> 00:19:50,305
That's the statistic.

199
00:19:54,743 --> 00:20:01,247
If you're on the top step, 10 years, a master's plus 60, this year fiscal 25, you're going to make $111,000.

200
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:07,628
In Arlington, the top salary is $83,466.

201
00:20:07,668 --> 00:20:08,789
I mean the average salary.

202
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:09,409
Melrose is $76,369.

203
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:09,910
Beverly is $84,765.

204
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:10,230
Malden is $83,366.

205
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,270
Marblehead is $84,365.

206
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,691
Mystic Valley, the charter school, is at $73,823.

207
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:14,412
Prospect Hill at $78, another charter school.

208
00:20:14,612 --> 00:20:15,653
And so on and so forth.

209
00:20:34,497 --> 00:20:42,760
Our teachers deserve good pay, but they don't leave because they can make $2,000 or $3,000 more in another community.

210
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,541
They leave because they're afraid they might get their job cut.

211
00:20:47,302 --> 00:20:49,202
They leave because they don't have good benefits.

212
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:54,384
And in Medford, health benefits and other benefits contractually are outstanding.

213
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:59,666
There are a lot of reasons why people stay in the Medford public schools or come to us.

214
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,747
Because our benefits are good.

215
00:21:02,848 --> 00:21:03,948
They're very good, by the way.

216
00:21:04,951 --> 00:21:07,473
and our salary is competitive.

217
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:11,937
There is a teacher shortage in the country, so, you know, Medford's gonna be affected by that.

218
00:21:11,957 --> 00:21:16,921
There are a lot of people not going into education right now because they're feeling that it's too challenging.

219
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,684
But people will stay with us for stability.

220
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:25,868
So the argument that somehow we're not competitive is not real.

221
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:30,391
Now, what are the alternatives besides free cash?

222
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:33,554
Well, first of all, Medford's new growth is in the tank.

223
00:21:34,546 --> 00:21:39,831
We're on any building permits currently in place at City Hall right now.

224
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:45,976
And unless you're really big on a beer haul, that's the only thing that I know about.

225
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,940
How much are we leaving on the table?

226
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:55,365
How can we grow the tax base rather than increase taxes on residents?

227
00:21:56,286 --> 00:21:56,927
We're not doing it.

228
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:58,448
We're not doing it.

229
00:21:59,794 --> 00:22:06,316
Don't penalize the school system operations by building up huge reserves in free cash.

230
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:09,317
Don't underestimate revenues.

231
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,978
Let's strive for affordability.

232
00:22:13,138 --> 00:22:20,620
And in the request for the override, there's these general categories, teacher salaries, this, that, and the other thing.

233
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:23,361
Be specific.

234
00:22:24,181 --> 00:22:25,862
The people who are voting for this

235
00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:30,003
are voting against it, need to know where every dollar is going.

236
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:37,584
They don't want to just hear it's going into a tank someplace that hopefully will support the kinds of things that we consider to be important.

237
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,565
General categories don't cut it.

238
00:22:42,465 --> 00:22:45,026
The override vote is less than two months away.

239
00:22:46,526 --> 00:22:51,447
And residents, citizens, are already voting or are going to start voting very soon.

240
00:22:52,627 --> 00:22:55,868
So besides the general information on the web, so the city's web,

241
00:22:57,037 --> 00:23:00,940
What does the average citizen know about the need and the impact?

242
00:23:01,341 --> 00:23:02,182
Probably not a lot.

243
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:15,093
Many of you will vote by mail at the general election for the president and senator, and local races are at a minimum.

244
00:23:16,034 --> 00:23:21,038
So there aren't a lot of people who might even come out because, you know, they'll vote for the president and that's it.

245
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,722
The Secretary of State, I'm going to pull this out.

246
00:23:25,463 --> 00:23:26,543
Most of you probably got this.

247
00:23:26,844 --> 00:23:30,647
Secretary of State sends out this every year, every year there's an election.

248
00:23:31,348 --> 00:23:38,474
And in it, not only are the candidates identified, but the ballot issues, there's five ballot issues statewide.

249
00:23:39,782 --> 00:23:55,453
They're identified with pros and cons and research so that you as a voter can actually decide based on some information based on partisans born against and research whether to vote for a particular item.

250
00:23:57,034 --> 00:24:00,636
I haven't seen anything in this city that would even comes close to that.

251
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:09,382
You have a lot of people who will go in there that day and they will not know the impact of what they're doing.

252
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:14,520
Some of them will think they're voting for $7 million for a new high school.

253
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,400
They're gonna be surprised.

254
00:24:18,961 --> 00:24:20,221
Many will vote by mail.

255
00:24:23,782 --> 00:24:31,303
So, is this the right way to request an override from our taxpayers?

256
00:24:33,164 --> 00:24:38,065
Our city deserves, our citizens deserve more transparency than we're currently seeing.

257
00:24:39,157 --> 00:24:42,920
Our citizens need more information on the city's finances.

258
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,843
The city council needs more information on the city's finances.

259
00:24:47,303 --> 00:24:48,043
They don't have it.

260
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:58,151
How many times, and we go to Rick or to anyone else, George, how many times have you asked the city's finance director, is he still reconciling some previous year?

261
00:24:59,272 --> 00:25:00,292
Well, they're working on it.

262
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,855
No one wants to tell anybody what's really there.

263
00:25:05,135 --> 00:25:05,956
And that's a problem.

264
00:25:06,456 --> 00:25:08,898
So people will vote without really knowing.

265
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:20,347
Our citizens need to know that there will be a likely third override coming to them in the future for that high school.

266
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:25,871
Now, whether it's a rebuild or it's a renovation, it's going to be expensive.

267
00:25:26,847 --> 00:25:27,707
It's gonna be expensive.

268
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:33,089
And SBA will not give us 90 cents on the dollar like they did way back when.

269
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:37,811
And we will not have buildings to sell off to pick up the rest and make money.

270
00:25:39,992 --> 00:25:47,315
Our citizens need to be assured, need to be assured that the school budget will not be shortchanged.

271
00:25:48,515 --> 00:25:51,556
That any municipal service will not be shortchanged.

272
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:56,278
When legitimate resources are available without an override.

273
00:25:57,808 --> 00:25:59,929
Let's not leverage the override.

274
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:04,590
Let's not create a crisis in order to get an override through.

275
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:19,954
If there's a need for more money down the road for operations, after the high school project becomes known and the reimbursement rate, well, okay, put it out there and people can talk about it.

276
00:26:20,615 --> 00:26:23,715
But right now, you haven't got all the information.

277
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:25,616
Right now, you don't know

278
00:26:26,321 --> 00:26:28,182
the big ticket item coming down the road.

279
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:30,004
You haven't got any idea.

280
00:26:30,024 --> 00:26:32,445
At least you don't, many of you don't.

281
00:26:33,706 --> 00:26:35,047
And it's important that you do.

282
00:26:36,068 --> 00:26:39,830
Because too many people out there are going to be pushed out of their homes.

283
00:26:40,711 --> 00:26:43,613
Too many people are going to not be able to afford to come to Medford.

284
00:26:44,774 --> 00:26:46,515
And our school system will be played with.

285
00:26:47,715 --> 00:26:49,796
You don't leverage the school system.

286
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:53,197
You make sure, you don't leverage the fire department, the police department.

287
00:26:53,497 --> 00:26:57,038
You don't leverage the, you make sure they have what they need to do the job.

288
00:26:57,978 --> 00:27:00,919
And if you've got the resources available, then do it.

289
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:05,381
And if you really, really need something, then you make the case for it.

290
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:08,422
And in my opinion, the case hasn't been made.

291
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:10,522
The case hasn't been made.

292
00:27:11,403 --> 00:27:12,183
Thank you for listening.

293
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:31,429
I'm honored that a friend of ours who's worked so hard for firefighters to capture grants and take the pressure off our citizens in our tax base, Secretary for our union, Danielle Masolino is here.

294
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:32,630
Welcome, Danielle.

295
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:38,083
Um, like George said, I am the union secretary for the firefighters.

296
00:28:38,203 --> 00:28:40,966
I'm also, um, I'm not just a secretary.

297
00:28:41,046 --> 00:28:42,207
I actually have a firefighter.

298
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:46,011
I work up at, um, um, I'm up at the heights now, actually.

299
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:46,291
Sorry.

300
00:28:47,012 --> 00:28:47,332
So, um,

301
00:28:48,838 --> 00:28:52,441
I am here representing our union on behalf of this subject.

302
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:58,865
Obviously, I'm sure many of you know that, like George said, we've had a lot of trials and tribulations in the city recently.

303
00:29:00,327 --> 00:29:05,490
And I've been hearing from some citizens, you know, we've had discussions.

304
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:21,596
with people I've come across that they think that we may just not want this headquarters or we don't like whatever is coming out of City Hall that with regard to us because we are at odds with the mayor currently and that is 100% not true.

305
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:34,318
We wouldn't like nothing more than a new headquarters because if anybody has either walked into our current headquarters or if you've seen any of our media that we post online is in bad shape and we would

306
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:36,860
We are in desperate need of the headquarters.

307
00:29:38,722 --> 00:30:00,040
That being said, we do not stand behind the debt exclusion that is being brought to the citizens because, for several reasons, mostly because what is being rolled out and what the debt exclusion would be paying for is a severely inadequate design plan for our headquarters, for our department.

308
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:12,484
We feel as a union that we can't, in good conscience, ask citizens to pay for a $30 million building that doesn't even meet basic needs of our department.

309
00:30:14,264 --> 00:30:23,447
And sadly, it doesn't meet our needs, mostly because we were completely excluded from the process to design the building.

310
00:30:26,414 --> 00:30:32,962
Actually, they specifically said that we were not allowed to be involved in the process.

311
00:30:33,563 --> 00:30:43,215
Even though within the department, the people that are living in the building, we came together, we formed a committee, we discussed the needs of the department and what we needed as a department going forward.

312
00:30:43,803 --> 00:30:49,046
to be able to grow and support the citizens as the city grows around us.

313
00:30:49,826 --> 00:30:53,889
And like I said, they completely disregarded anything we had to say.

314
00:30:54,469 --> 00:31:04,434
They never asked for our opinion and they actually told the old chief, the former chief Friedman, that he was not to let us know any information that he had about this building.

315
00:31:06,553 --> 00:31:18,382
When we did finally get a seat with the chief of staff back last summer to discuss what was going on, we were told that they were getting ready to green light a project because they thought it was wonderful.

316
00:31:18,882 --> 00:31:27,528
So we got a chance to take a peek at what was going on and we found a building that it wasn't capable of

317
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:31,216
supporting any growth within our department at all.

318
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:39,902
Like I said, we weren't going to be able to add any more companies that, you know, could do extra, you know, with extra skills or anything like that.

319
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:41,363
It was only what was currently there.

320
00:31:42,604 --> 00:31:47,227
We also found a building that was going to have rooms that were

321
00:31:49,213 --> 00:31:50,414
we call them dual occupancy.

322
00:31:50,454 --> 00:31:55,076
So currently we live in rooms that I, we sleep in bunk rooms with multiple people.

323
00:31:55,337 --> 00:31:56,817
Like it's, you know, like summer camp.

324
00:31:57,678 --> 00:32:02,221
Um, so this building was getting built and we were actually going to be sleeping in rooms together again.

325
00:32:02,241 --> 00:32:07,564
I don't know if any of you go home with your coworkers and sleep with them, but it's, it's a little strange.

326
00:32:08,164 --> 00:32:10,465
Um, I know.

327
00:32:11,646 --> 00:32:11,726
Um,

328
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,211
But that's just been the way that it's been at the fire service.

329
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:20,992
And that's fire service nationwide.

330
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:22,473
It was always like that in the past.

331
00:32:23,334 --> 00:32:24,414
But obviously, times are changing.

332
00:32:24,454 --> 00:32:25,175
Things are changing.

333
00:32:25,335 --> 00:32:26,075
We have women.

334
00:32:26,115 --> 00:32:30,417
We have all walks of life want to be firefighters now, which is great.

335
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:32,679
And it's nice to see departments diversifying.

336
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,820
So that being said, we need to be able to accommodate that.

337
00:32:36,061 --> 00:32:40,143
And the building design that we had been shown last summer actually didn't accommodate that.

338
00:32:40,363 --> 00:32:45,706
And it was actually, to me personally, it was a little upsetting.

339
00:32:47,106 --> 00:32:51,849
And that was down to bathrooms, bunk rooms, showers, locker rooms, everything.

340
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:54,190
So everything was going to be like a shared space.

341
00:32:55,091 --> 00:33:02,235
So one of the other big concerns that we had is, you know, the fire union had was when the police station went up.

342
00:33:03,496 --> 00:33:09,140
I'm sure all of you know that all that ended up going in a space that was where our former training tower was in.

343
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,581
We were very upset about losing our training tower.

344
00:33:14,022 --> 00:33:17,303
I mean, we posted about it everywhere, and I think we'd pick it in and everything.

345
00:33:18,324 --> 00:33:24,466
So we were promised, especially by this mayor, and we were promised by the former mayor, that we were going to get a training tower.

346
00:33:25,146 --> 00:33:32,929
And when we saw the design plan for the new headquarters, what we found was it was nothing more than a stairwell, and they were calling it a training tower.

347
00:33:33,569 --> 00:33:36,850
For us, training tower, our old training tower, we could actually burn.

348
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:43,072
We could light things on fire in it and put it out like the way we would do in regular homes.

349
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:49,563
This training tower was, like I said, it was just a stairwell, and it was actually a means of egress.

350
00:33:49,723 --> 00:33:53,246
So the rest of the building would be using that to enter and exit the building.

351
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:57,828
And that is actually, you can't call that training grounds if it's a means of egress.

352
00:33:57,908 --> 00:33:58,689
They have to be separate.

353
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,611
So we were rather upset when we saw the design.

354
00:34:03,051 --> 00:34:07,094
We brought these concerns up with the chief of staff.

355
00:34:07,134 --> 00:34:08,174
She brought them to the mayor.

356
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:12,377
They seemed surprised, and then they

357
00:34:13,157 --> 00:34:14,518
kind of went back to the drawing board.

358
00:34:14,738 --> 00:34:20,703
And from then on, we actually were not allowed again, not allowed to do any, any planning.

359
00:34:20,743 --> 00:34:22,244
We weren't allowed to talk about our needs.

360
00:34:22,364 --> 00:34:32,592
So when we got another plan that was kind of brought to us by Chief Friedman in early or late last year, it again, fell very short.

361
00:34:32,952 --> 00:34:35,434
So we're missing space for, um,

362
00:34:37,768 --> 00:34:38,948
We're missing storage space.

363
00:34:39,028 --> 00:34:44,150
We're missing space to be able to add more pieces of apparatus so that the department could grow.

364
00:34:44,671 --> 00:34:48,352
We're missing space to add more members of the department.

365
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:55,875
And again, there were other shortcomings as far as bathroom space, locker space, things like that.

366
00:34:56,595 --> 00:35:02,077
And so, you know, we obviously are not happy with this plan.

367
00:35:02,787 --> 00:35:15,211
aside from not being happy with the plan, we were told the reason why this plan couldn't be any better than it was was because the budget that the city had set aside was $30 million and that they couldn't spend another dime more than the $30 million that they had.

368
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:20,633
So we were like, okay, if that's it, well, we'll try to work with this.

369
00:35:20,893 --> 00:35:25,434
And we walked around with the contractor, we tried to make it work.

370
00:35:26,034 --> 00:35:28,035
And then we found out that this debt exclusion was coming out.

371
00:35:28,906 --> 00:35:36,428
And now we're finding out that the debt exclusion is actually for the entire $30 million project.

372
00:35:37,248 --> 00:35:43,730
So our question for the city was, what happened to the money that you budgeted originally?

373
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:56,934
And if there were shortcomings in the budget that you had, if there was going to be a debt exclusion, why weren't you asking for extra money to be able to maybe make that happen, maybe meet the needs of the department?

374
00:35:57,514 --> 00:36:02,176
We're not asking for luxuries, we're just asking for basics within the headquarters.

375
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:13,302
And it's actually shocking to us to see that the city is not planning to spend a single dollar on this building, and they're asking all of our citizens to foot the whole bill.

376
00:36:14,362 --> 00:36:17,764
And so because of all of these things, we 100% don't want to see

377
00:36:20,452 --> 00:36:29,658
our citizens be impacted by this, and then to turn around and actually know that the project's also going to have some severe shortcomings and it's not going to fit the needs of the department.

378
00:36:30,178 --> 00:36:34,401
So, you know, we're asking people to vote no on this.

379
00:36:43,862 --> 00:36:48,784
We obviously, like George said, we've had a tough year.

380
00:36:49,005 --> 00:36:51,486
We don't have a lot of communication with the city.

381
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:59,450
And so, you know, these questions really, we don't really have an opportunity to ask these questions, sit down and talk to them.

382
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,731
We did have conversations.

383
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:03,812
We did talk about things that were going to be changed.

384
00:37:03,892 --> 00:37:07,794
And then we were told that we were to be excluded from then on.

385
00:37:07,954 --> 00:37:13,377
Our former chief told us that he was specifically told that we were not supposed to be told about these things.

386
00:37:14,577 --> 00:37:17,360
Unfortunately, we can't even help try to make this better.

387
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:27,289
So other than just the fact that there's just so many shortcomings, we really, we do not stand behind this tax increase at all.

388
00:37:28,591 --> 00:37:31,013
And we're asking all of you to vote no on it.

389
00:37:35,877 --> 00:37:42,980
We've had, I've had a couple of people reach out asking us to come in support of the tax increase, and I've emailed back.

390
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,902
I'm a little better when I have a little bit of head start and be able to write it all down and edit what I have to say.

391
00:37:49,022 --> 00:37:58,505
So I had emailed back a couple of people, one woman specifically at one of the schools, and explained why we couldn't, you know, we weren't in support of this.

392
00:37:58,645 --> 00:38:02,646
And I didn't even get so much of a thank you for your time.

393
00:38:04,608 --> 00:38:06,389
because we weren't supporting it.

394
00:38:06,509 --> 00:38:09,290
Nobody was interested in why we aren't supporting it.

395
00:38:09,471 --> 00:38:10,111
I shouldn't say nobody.

396
00:38:10,531 --> 00:38:13,152
That specific person was not interested in why we weren't supporting it.

397
00:38:13,973 --> 00:38:17,795
So we feel like it's necessary that we want to get out there as to why we don't support it.

398
00:38:17,855 --> 00:38:25,859
But at the same time, it's a little difficult just because of the current climate to do so without sounding like we're just a bunch of angry people and we just don't like anything.

399
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,620
So if anybody does have any questions,

400
00:38:31,624 --> 00:38:34,425
I'm available, the other union officials are available.

401
00:38:34,465 --> 00:38:37,885
If you ever have any questions, feel free to reach out to us.

402
00:38:38,346 --> 00:38:41,026
If you need our email addresses or anything, you can ask me now.

403
00:38:41,906 --> 00:38:43,827
Yep, George Scarpelli can also get it out to you.

404
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:46,007
We would be happy to talk about any of these things.

405
00:38:46,447 --> 00:38:53,729
We greatly appreciate everybody's support throughout everything that we've been going through this year.

406
00:38:54,789 --> 00:38:57,630
Everybody's been wonderful about that.

407
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:58,730
Thank you.
