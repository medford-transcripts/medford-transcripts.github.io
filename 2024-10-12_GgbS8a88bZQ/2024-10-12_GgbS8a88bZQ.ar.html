    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=282.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>:  Nice to see everybody.
 Thank you for giving me an opportunity to say a few things.
 And hopefully, what I express will help you understand what's going on.
 Obviously, I'm here to share my perspectives and my thoughts about the upcoming questions on the November ballot, especially those that affect public education.
 So while I'm no longer the superintendent of schools, I'm in my seventh year of retirement or semi-retirement, I still stay very aware of education items, both in the community, the state, nation, and it's very enlightening to see what people are doing around the commonwealth.
 I spent 50 years in Medford public education, 23 years as superintendent,
 And I also served at different times as the budget director, the curriculum director, and the personnel administrator, as well as a teacher.
 So I care deeply about what happens in our schools and our community.
 I'm not here tonight to criticize the school administration.
 I know how hard they work.
 I know the challenges that they face.
 And I know that some of the things are beyond their control.
 I have always believed, and I still do, that schools deserve solid levels of funding and that the budget process must promote and support quality programming, stability, and predictability.
 Budget development must be resourceful and creative.
 It should not be a destabilizing force, exercise, and create uncertainty and conflict.
 And I think that's what's happened in the last couple of years.
 Yes, there will be from time to time differences among officials, educators, constituents, but at all times, they should be based on the facts, on available resources, best practices, and the needs of students and their families, as well as the community at large.
 The current override ballot questions, initiatives, and two of them in education, and one, a debt exclusion for the fire department,
 Call for, if you will, in the school department, a $7 million hike.
 You had a half a million dollars for the DPW at 7.5.
 This is a property tax levy.
 This request is based upon the argument that the school system has been perpetually in a structural deficit, and it's not true.
 The pertinent questions are these.
 Is it true that we're in a deficit?
 How does Medford compare with other communities around us?
 Are there good alternatives available to meet our needs?
 Is this a one-time request or will there be another one, a larger request in the near future?
 And I think you know the answer to that.
 What is the real impact on the Medford taxpayer?
 And does the voting public truly understand the pros and cons?
 And has there been sufficient information and time for the public to make an informed decision?
 So let's take a look and let's consider the following.
 The last two years relied heavily on the use of federal ARPA and ESSER funds.
 They were put out there because of the COVID crisis.
 It was well known that when these funds were used up, there would be a need for the city to sustain staff and programs with local and state revenues.
 Otherwise, there would be undesirable cuts to program and personnel.
 So was this necessary?
 When the budget process took place in the last year, everybody knew that those funds had to be replaced.
 And those funds enabled the city to build up a free cash reserve that is three times what has ever been in place.
 Almost at this point in time, $35 million.
 And if that was the case, was it necessary?
 And did the mayor really fail to provide full funding consistent with the school committee's request?
 when there's a significant amount of free cash available to the city, much higher than the amount available in previous years.
 The school administration, by law, is required to ask, and the school committee as well, for an amount sufficient to support the schools under Proposition 2 1⁄2.
 It's their legal request to do that.
 The mayor or the city manager in the past, when 2 1⁄2 passed, had the bottom line, and the city council
 can only approve or cut what the mayor provides.
 So it's not simple.
 The amount of money reported to DOR of free cash was $25 million in 2004.
 And as I indicated, they added another $9 million or thereabouts in the current fiscal year.
 Why, given the often repeated
 mantra of the mayor, transparency.
 Interesting word.
 And the city's financial director, did they fail to provide a clean and complete report on the city's financial position to the city council and the school committee?
 I think the answer's simple.
 The answer is that they wanted to leverage a crisis to create
 a need for an override, because you're in a situation where you don't have it, you're threatening cuts to important services, and if you don't give me the money, we're gonna have to do drastic measures.
 This is not Proposition 2 1⁄2.
 In 1981, 1982, I was in the school system.
 I was working with the superintendent's office, and the budget of the city of Medford for the schools was $19.4 million.
 That year, we had to cut $3.2 million.
 That's a cut.
 150 people got laid off.
 That was difficult, very difficult.
 We are not in that situation right now.
 We are not in that situation.
 When the 2024 DOR, Department of Revenue Tax Recap Report is studied, and I did that,
 There are clear underestimates of revenue amounts when compared with 2023, specifically by almost 15%.
 So in other words saying, if investment income was X, it was 14% less when they were projecting their revenue, almost $18 million.
 Why create a crisis?
 Before you ask the public for an override, should you not first use the obvious resources available?
 You can always go back later on and say, you know, we used up our resources.
 But when you have them, why won't you use them?
 Let's talk about the tax rate.
 The Medford tax rate is low.
 The residential tax rate is low comparatively to area communities.
 Nothing wrong with that.
 I don't think anyone feels like it has to be number one, the highest tax rate in the Commonwealth.
 So it's not a bad thing when affordability for housing and other needs is challenging.
 If the overrides and debt exclusion pass, taxes will increase, I think, by at least 10%.
 especially when you include the 2.5% statutory increase that happens virtually every year.
 And what about the impact of re-evaluation?
 You know what's going on right now.
 They're checking your houses out.
 And by the way, if you haven't noticed, your house is worth more than it was when you bought it, in most cases.
 And when they reassess it, they're going to reassess it and the taxes are going to go up.
 And on top of that, you're probably going to pay a little bit more for water and sewer.
 And when you add it all together, if you have to take an equity loan, you're gonna pay a hell of a lot more interest than you might like.
 And if you're a new person wanting to buy a home, the mortgage rates are still at 6.2%, and even if it goes down to 5%, it's a hell of a lot higher than it was when people refinanced a few years ago.
 And what about renters?
 Some of these people will never have a chance.
 They just won't be able to
 to get in and the landlords are going to pass on the rent to their tenants.
 So, that affects people too.
 When you think about it, there's also a deduction, tax deduction limit.
 You used to be able to take your income tax and your house property tax and interest.
 You can't do that anymore in the current rule.
 So, you can't even deduct some of the stuff that you used to be able to do before.
 Some people can get around it for various reasons,
 Not everybody.
 If you look at the age factor in the community, 22% of Medford residents are over the age of 60.
 14% are 70 or more.
 A lot of these people are on fixed incomes.
 They don't have another alternative to go to.
 And they're probably supporting their children, their grandchildren, and everything else like that as well.
 So a hit like this is really significant.
 By the way, as the high school project moves forward, and it's in a planning stage right now, undoubtedly there will be another override request, which isn't out there right now.
 That'll make three override requests.
 The two that are there now, and the one that might come up, plus the debt exclusion, in the very near future.
 Given the cost of a rebuild,
 or renovation, this will be the biggest number that you've ever seen.
 The SBA reimbursement rate is not known at this time.
 It will only cover certain costs.
 Not everything is eligible.
 If you look at high schools that have been built or renovated in recent times, you're talking somewhere in the vicinity of $200 million to $400 million to redo the high school.
 We've got vocational shops and other things like that that have to be preserved.
 That's an expensive thing.
 And if you maybe get 35, 40%, not getting the 90% that we got for the schools, the K through 12 schools that we got several years ago with Rick as the chairperson of the building committee at that time.
 And we, by the way, sold the old schools so that we actually made money.
 Don't tell anybody.
 You don't get that now.
 So you're gonna be talking about potentially 100 to $200 million of local assessment over and above.
 That will impact taxes on top of the early override assessments.
 And by the way, if the override passes in November,
 you will see the increase on your January 2025 tax bill.
 You're not gonna wait a year to build it up.
 You're gonna see it in January.
 It's only a few months away.
 Now one of the arguments that comes around is that somehow Medford salaries and cost per pupil are not competitive.
 Now as a educator, I think I started off with this, I want every nickel I can get for the schools.
 I mean, I'd be less than honest if I didn't tell you that I think the schools deserve every nickel we can give them, and we have plenty of needs.
 But no one gets everything they want, and no school system is able to do that, and no community is able to do that.
 Well, let's take a look at the Medford Public Schools financials.
 And this is according to the latest Department of Elementary and Secondary Education statistics.
 The state average per pupil is $19,714.
 Medford is currently spending $21,372.
 Arlington is spending $18,615.
 Malden is spending $17,428.
 Melrose is spending $15,540.
 Peabody is spending $16,996, and I can go on and on.
 Now, someone can say, well, there are, Mystic Valley, by the way, one of the charter schools that sucks away dollars from our budget, is paying, is spending $14,167.
 Now, there are places, Somerville 23958, we just built a building so you can see where,
 that's involved.
 And by the way, if you want to chase Cambridge, Cambridge is spending $36,712.
 Of course, Cambridge has got a property base that's incredible.
 And Burlington is $25,297.
 And by the way, if we were still sending kids to Minuteman, the cost would be $34,176.
 And if we continued to send 50 kids there like we did when we cut it off, we'd be pushing $2 million a year of money out of our pocket.
 And that's why we rebuilt the vocational school.
 And people argued about, why are you not sending the kids to Minuteman?
 Because they're sucking dollars out of Medford.
 And we had a right to rebuild our own school and run our own programs at a far less cost.
 So, then the question comes about teacher salaries.
 Where's Charlene?
 Charlene?
 All right, Charlene, don't take offense.
 Okay.
 If you look at the average salary for the Medford teachers, average salary, and this is latest numbers, you know, obviously it's gone up a little bit.
 The average salary is $88,179.
 That's the statistic.
 If you're on the top step, 10 years, a master's plus 60, this year fiscal 25, you're going to make $111,000.
 In Arlington, the top salary is $83,466.
 I mean the average salary.
 Melrose is $76,369.
 Beverly is $84,765.
 Malden is $83,366.
 Marblehead is $84,365.
 Mystic Valley, the charter school, is at $73,823.
 Prospect Hill at $78, another charter school.
 And so on and so forth.
 Our teachers deserve good pay, but they don't leave because they can make $2,000 or $3,000 more in another community.
 They leave because they're afraid they might get their job cut.
 They leave because they don't have good benefits.
 And in Medford, health benefits and other benefits contractually are outstanding.
 There are a lot of reasons why people stay in the Medford public schools or come to us.
 Because our benefits are good.
 They're very good, by the way.
 and our salary is competitive.
 There is a teacher shortage in the country, so, you know, Medford's gonna be affected by that.
 There are a lot of people not going into education right now because they're feeling that it's too challenging.
 But people will stay with us for stability.
 So the argument that somehow we're not competitive is not real.
 Now, what are the alternatives besides free cash?
 Well, first of all, Medford's new growth is in the tank.
 We're on any building permits currently in place at City Hall right now.
 And unless you're really big on a beer haul, that's the only thing that I know about.
 How much are we leaving on the table?
 How can we grow the tax base rather than increase taxes on residents?
 We're not doing it.
 We're not doing it.
 Don't penalize the school system operations by building up huge reserves in free cash.
 Don't underestimate revenues.
 Let's strive for affordability.
 And in the request for the override, there's these general categories, teacher salaries, this, that, and the other thing.
 Be specific.
 The people who are voting for this
 are voting against it, need to know where every dollar is going.
 They don't want to just hear it's going into a tank someplace that hopefully will support the kinds of things that we consider to be important.
 General categories don't cut it.
 The override vote is less than two months away.
 And residents, citizens, are already voting or are going to start voting very soon.
 So besides the general information on the web, so the city's web,
 What does the average citizen know about the need and the impact?
 Probably not a lot.
 Many of you will vote by mail at the general election for the president and senator, and local races are at a minimum.
 So there aren't a lot of people who might even come out because, you know, they'll vote for the president and that's it.
 The Secretary of State, I'm going to pull this out.
 Most of you probably got this.
 Secretary of State sends out this every year, every year there's an election.
 And in it, not only are the candidates identified, but the ballot issues, there's five ballot issues statewide.
 They're identified with pros and cons and research so that you as a voter can actually decide based on some information based on partisans born against and research whether to vote for a particular item.
 I haven't seen anything in this city that would even comes close to that.
 You have a lot of people who will go in there that day and they will not know the impact of what they're doing.
 Some of them will think they're voting for $7 million for a new high school.
 They're gonna be surprised.
 Many will vote by mail.
 So, is this the right way to request an override from our taxpayers?
 Our city deserves, our citizens deserve more transparency than we're currently seeing.
 Our citizens need more information on the city's finances.
 The city council needs more information on the city's finances.
 They don't have it.
 How many times, and we go to Rick or to anyone else, George, how many times have you asked the city's finance director, is he still reconciling some previous year?
 Well, they're working on it.
 No one wants to tell anybody what's really there.
 And that's a problem.
 So people will vote without really knowing.
 Our citizens need to know that there will be a likely third override coming to them in the future for that high school.
 Now, whether it's a rebuild or it's a renovation, it's going to be expensive.
 It's gonna be expensive.
 And SBA will not give us 90 cents on the dollar like they did way back when.
 And we will not have buildings to sell off to pick up the rest and make money.
 Our citizens need to be assured, need to be assured that the school budget will not be shortchanged.
 That any municipal service will not be shortchanged.
 When legitimate resources are available without an override.
 Let's not leverage the override.
 Let's not create a crisis in order to get an override through.
 If there's a need for more money down the road for operations, after the high school project becomes known and the reimbursement rate, well, okay, put it out there and people can talk about it.
 But right now, you haven't got all the information.
 Right now, you don't know
 the big ticket item coming down the road.
 You haven't got any idea.
 At least you don't, many of you don't.
 And it's important that you do.
 Because too many people out there are going to be pushed out of their homes.
 Too many people are going to not be able to afford to come to Medford.
 And our school system will be played with.
 You don't leverage the school system.
 You make sure, you don't leverage the fire department, the police department.
 You don't leverage the, you make sure they have what they need to do the job.
 And if you've got the resources available, then do it.
 And if you really, really need something, then you make the case for it.
 And in my opinion, the case hasn't been made.
 The case hasn't been made.
 Thank you for listening.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1714.059s">[Danielle Marcellino]</a>: 嗯，正如乔治所说，我是消防员联盟的秘书。
 我也是，哼，我不仅是秘书。
 实际上，我有一名消防员。
 我工作，嗯，哼，现在我身高了。
 对不起。
 所以，嗯，
 我在这里以这个话题的名义代表我们的联盟。
 显然，我敢肯定，你们中的许多人都知道，正如乔治所说，我们最近在这座城市有很多证据和磨难。
 我已经听到了一些公民，我们进行了讨论。
 与我发现的人在一起，他们认为您可能不想要这种渴求，或者我们不喜欢城市的建议，因为我们今天不同意市长，这不是100％不是真的。
 我们不希望只有一个新的总部，因为如果有人来到我们当前的总部，或者如果您看到我们发布的任何媒体，我们的线路都处于不良状态，并且会做到这一点
 我们迫切需要总部。
 也就是说，我们不支持将被带给公民带来的债务的排除，因为出于各种原因，主要是因为正在实施的是什么以及将债务的排除在内，这是我们总部的严重不适当的设计计划。
 我们认为作为一个联盟，我们不能要求公民支付一座耗资3000万美元的建筑，甚至不满足我们部门的基本需求。
 而且，不幸的是，它不能满足我们的需求，主要是因为我们被完全排除在设计建筑物的过程之外。
 实际上，他们特别说我们不允许参加这一过程。
 尽管在该部门内，我们居住在建筑物中的人们，我们加入了一个委员会，讨论了该部门的需求以及我们将来作为部门所需要的东西。
 随着城市在我们周围的成长，能够成长和支持公民。
 正如我所说，他们完全忽略了我们必须说的一切。
 他们从未提出过我们的意见，并真正告诉前老板，前首席弗里德曼，他不应该告知我们有关这座建筑物的任何信息。
 去年夏天，当我们终于与参谋长坐着讨论发生了什么事时，他们告诉我们他们正在准备照亮一个项目，因为他们认为这很棒。
 因此，我们有机会看看正在发生的事情，发现一栋无法
 支持我们部门的任何增长。
 就像我说的那样，它将无法添加更多的公司，您知道，他们可以通过其他技能或其他工作来做更多的事情。
 这正是今天那里的东西。
 我们还找到了一栋房间的建筑物
 我们称它们为双重职业。
 因此，我们目前住在我和几个人一起睡在文学中的房间里。
 您知道，就像夏令营一样。
 嗯，所以这座建筑是正在建造的，我们真的会再次一起睡在房间里。
 我不知道你们是否有任何人要和您的工人一起回家并与他们一起睡觉，但是这有点奇怪。
 嗯，我知道。
 哼，
 但这就是消防部门的方式。
 这是全国各地的消防员服务。
 过去一直如此。
 但是显然时代正在改变。
 事情正在发生变化。
 我们有女人。
 我们拥有现在想要成为消防员的生活的所有领域，这很棒。
 很高兴看到部门多元化。
 也就是说，我们需要适应这个。
 去年夏天向我们展示的建​​筑物的设计并不适合。
 就我个人而言，这确实有点烦人。
 这简化为浴室，文学，淋浴，更衣室等。
 因此，一切都像一个共享空间。
 因此，您遇到的其他巨大担忧之一是，消防员工会是警察局上升的时候。
 我相信每个人都知道，在我们旧训练塔所在的空间中结束的一切。
 我们对失去训练塔感到非常沮丧。
 我的意思是，我们到处都发表了有关它的信息，我认为我们会选择和一切。
 因此，这位前市长特别向我们保证，尤其是将要获得训练塔的前市长。
 当我们看到新总部的设计计划时，我们发现它不过是梯子，他们称之为训练塔。
 对我们来说，训练塔，我们的旧训练塔真的可以燃烧。
 我们可以照亮事物，并像普通房屋一样将其关闭。
 正如我所说，这座训练塔只是一个楼梯，实际上是一种出发方式。
 因此，建筑物的其余部分是使用它进入并离开建筑物。
 确实，如果这是一种出发方式，您将无法称呼这个训练领域。
 他们需要分开。
 因此，当我们看到设计时，我们很烦人。
 我们与参谋长联系了这些关注。
 她把他们带到市长。
 他们似乎很惊讶，然后他们
 这样的东西又回到了剪贴板上。
 从那时起，我们再也没有被允许，不允许计划。
 我们不允许谈论我们的需求。
 因此，当我们在去年年初或年底之前获得了另一个计划时，他很短。
 所以我们没有空间，哼
 我们没有存储空间。
 我们没有添加更多设备的空间，以便该部门可以增长。
 我们没有添加更多部门成员的空间。
 再说一次，浴室的空间中还有其他残疾，壁橱中的空间，类似的东西。
 因此，您知道，显然我们对这个计划不满意。
 除了对该计划不满意外，他们还告诉我们，该计划再也没有比这更好的了，因为该市保留的预算是3000万美元，而且他们再花费的一分钱超出了他们拥有的3000万美元。
 因此，我们认为，好的，如果是全部，那么，我们将尝试与之合作。
 我们和承包商一起行走，我们试图工作。
 然后我们发现这种债务排除正在释放。
 现在，我们发现债务排除实际上是整个3000万美元的项目。
 因此，我们对这座城市的问题是：您最初带来的钱怎么了？
 如果预算中有残疾，如果排除了债务，为什么我不要求额外的钱发生，也许可以满足部门的需求？
 我们不是在要求奢侈品，我们只是在要求总部的基本概念。
 看到这座城市不打算在这座建筑物上花一美元，他们要求我们所有的公民支付整个账单，这真令人震惊。
 因此，对于所有这些事情，100％不想看到
 我们的公民将受到这一影响，然后将成为并知道该项目还会有一些严重的缺陷，并且将不满足部门的需求。
 因此，您知道，我们要求人们对此投票。
 显然，正如乔治所说，我们度过了艰难的一年。
 我们与这座城市没有太多沟通。
 因此，您知道，这些问题确实没有机会提出这些问题，坐下并与他们交谈。
 我们进行了对话。
 我们谈论了会改变的事情。
 然后他们告诉我们，我们稍后应该被排除在外。
 我们的前任负责人告诉我们，他被明确告知他们不应该告诉我们有关这些事情的信息。
 不幸的是，我们甚至无法尝试改进它。
 因此，除了有很多缺点之外，我们确实不支持这种税收增加。
 我们要求每个人不要投票。
 我们有，我有一些人要求我们相信增加税收并发送电子邮件和电子邮件。
 当我有一些优势时，我会好一些，并且可以编写所有内容并编辑我必须说的话。
 因此，我向两个人发送了一封电子邮件，并向其中一所学校发送了一位女性，并解释了为什么我们不能，我们不支持它。
 而且我什至没有非常感谢您的时间。
 因为我们不支持它。
 没有人对我们不支持的原因感兴趣。
 我不应该说任何人。
 这个特定的人对我们为什么不支持她不感兴趣。
 因此，我们觉得我们需要出去，因为我们不支持他。
 但是，与此同时，这有点困难，因为当前的天气使它看起来不像许多人感到烦恼，我们只是不喜欢任何东西。
 因此，如果有人有任何疑问，
