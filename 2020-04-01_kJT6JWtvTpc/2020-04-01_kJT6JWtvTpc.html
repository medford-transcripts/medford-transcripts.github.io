    <p>[Gayle McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=1.148s">Hello</a>  to all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=2.749s">My</a>  name is Gail McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=4.93s">I'm</a>  the former two-term mayor of Richmond, California. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=8.652s">Richmond</a>  is a diverse city in the San Francisco Bay Area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=13.795s">I'm</a>  also a co-founder of the Richmond Progressive Alliance, otherwise known as the RPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=20.438s">And</a>  through our joint efforts in Richmond as an alliance and with progressive electives sitting on the city council, my work as mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=29.363s">we</a>  were able to make a transformative change in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=33.531s">we</a>  were able to beat back a giant oil refinery, the Chevron Richmond oil refinery in our city, who spent over $3 million in 2014 to try and defeat me and other progressives. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=48.418s">But</a>  we all prevailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=49.899s">We</a>  prevailed because we worked side by side with the community and educated the community and uplifted the community and stood for the important, bold issues of our city, <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=62.94s">and</a>  of our time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=64.761s">Now</a>  today, I'm here to support Anna Callahan as your state representative in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=72.044s">Now,</a>  I met Anna when she was living in the Bay Area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=76.086s">She</a>  came to Richmond and had heard about our model of organizing and wanted to know more about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=81.888s">She</a>  helped us make a video about the RPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=84.99s">And</a>  she also created an organization called the Incorruptibles. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=90.512s">That</a>  organization trains <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=93.808s">candidates</a>  and groups in terms of building a local movement and running candidates for office without any corporate money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=103.791s">So</a>  she has taken the RPA model and spread it to other places, exactly what we wanted to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=110.372s">So</a>  I thank Anna for her work in spreading the model of organizing that RPA spearheaded. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=117.114s">It's</a>  an important model and everyone should learn it, become part of it, <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=123.119s">and</a>  as a result, be able to transform your communities as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=128.963s">Now,</a>  when I heard that Anna was running to be your representative in Massachusetts, I was thrilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=136.827s">There</a>  is no better candidate, no more knowledgeable candidate of the organizing that needs to be done, as well as the issues that need to be lifted up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=148.034s">So</a>  I 100% endorse her efforts, <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=151.638s">I</a>  know that she will build the kind of organizing effort through her campaign that is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=158.28s">And</a>  when elected, she'll keep that organizing work going, which is what needs to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=164.582s">Too</a>  many candidates get elected and then they forget about organizing and the movement that they may have had just becomes inactive and ineffective. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=176.006s">There</a>  has to be that side-by-side relationship with <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=179.766s">corporate-free</a>  progressive electeds and the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=185.09s">Now,</a>  Anna has the kind of understanding of issues that are so essential for transformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=195.276s">Issues</a>  that she stands for are things like Medicare for All, housing for all in Massachusetts, a Massachusetts Green New Deal, <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=204.973s">She</a>  stands for a living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=207.314s">She</a>  stands for free public college. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=210.095s">She</a>  stands for the kind of Massachusetts Green New Deal that will bring about the kind of jobs that you need in Massachusetts while bringing about a sustainable planet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=225.12s">So</a>  I encourage you all to become active in Anna's campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=231.982s">She</a>  not only wants people that are <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=234.104s">currently</a>  part of the civic process who have already been active in standing up in their communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=240.368s">She</a>  wants your support for sure, but she wants to expand on that and get those who have not been active to participate in the civic process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=250.315s">She</a>  knows there are marginalized communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=252.973s">that</a>  have not been empowered, that do not know the steps they need to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=258.256s">She</a>  will help them learn those steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=260.317s">She</a>  will stand side by side with them and all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=264.2s">So</a>  I encourage you all to go to AnnaCallahan.com and volunteer for her campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=270.163s">Donate</a>  whatever you can to her campaign because <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=273.745s">She</a>  doesn't take corporate money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=275.466s">She</a>  doesn't take corporate super PAC money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=278.008s">She</a>  depends on all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=280.07s">So</a>  please give her your 100% support as I am giving her. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=286.094s">We</a>  need the kind of elected officials that we know Anna Callahan will be and the kind of movement builder that Anna Callahan has been and will continue to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=302.055s">So</a>  enjoy the kickoff today, the launch of her wonderful campaign, and I'll be rooting for all of you in Massachusetts, for Anna, for state representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=312.383s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=313.584s">Wish</a>  I could be with you, but hope this video shares some of my enthusiasm. <a href="https://youtu.be/kJT6JWtvTpc&t=318.328s">Thanks</a>  again.</p>
