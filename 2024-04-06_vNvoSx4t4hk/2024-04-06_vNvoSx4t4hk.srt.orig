1
00:00:00,129 --> 00:00:01,551
Okay, alright.

2
00:00:44,935 --> 00:00:45,456
Yeah.

3
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,976
♪ The moment I wake up ♪

4
00:02:52,099 --> 00:03:03,196
[SPEAKER_09]: To live without you will only mean heartbreak for me.

5
00:03:03,737 --> 00:03:07,763
I'm good, I'm good right now.

6
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:34,837
[SPEAKER_09]: ♪ I just take time ♪ ♪ And all through my coffee break time ♪ ♪ I feel around for you

7
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:29,693
[SPEAKER_04]: They're meant to be walking through the Game of Thrones landscape, but I freak out if I get a drop of rain on them.

8
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:31,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, no, you have to carry me.

9
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:32,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I know how it is.

10
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,677
[SPEAKER_05]: I do, being a bit of a closed horse myself.

11
00:04:35,897 --> 00:04:37,918
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

12
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Lovely, lovely, lovely.

13
00:04:42,352 --> 00:04:46,098
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got water, you've got water.

14
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:46,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

15
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:47,480
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

16
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:49,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we, is this it?

17
00:04:50,185 --> 00:04:50,886
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be soon.

18
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:52,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see.

19
00:04:52,488 --> 00:04:53,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we're good to go.

20
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Quick break.

21
00:05:14,853 --> 00:05:40,554
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, boots fly, yeah.

22
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:41,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Becky's a good friend of mine.

23
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,021
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going crazy, you know, with the Italian prisoner, you know.

24
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:47,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she's all over the place.

25
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:09,467
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I love it.

26
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:15,810
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we're back and forth all the time, you know, talking all the time.

27
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you talk about a good time?

28
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:23,133
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't gone yet, but we know because, you know.

29
00:06:23,153 --> 00:06:23,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

30
00:06:24,054 --> 00:06:26,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody ready?

31
00:06:26,475 --> 00:06:26,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

32
00:06:36,923 --> 00:06:38,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, friends and neighbors.

33
00:06:38,504 --> 00:06:44,388
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Terry E. Carter, and I direct elder services here at our beloved West Medford Community Center.

34
00:06:44,929 --> 00:06:50,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to another live monthly presentation of First Friday's Words and Music.

35
00:06:51,754 --> 00:07:04,943
[SPEAKER_06]: It is indeed the first Friday of April, and thanks to a generous grant from the Medford Arts Council, a member of the Massachusetts Cultural Council, we are back on the block at 111 Arlington Street.

36
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:26,375
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have truly hit our programming stride over the last few months, featuring a fabulous trio of authors during Black History Month in February, and an engaging portrait of Pan Am's groundbreaking blackbird stewardesses during Women's History Month in March.

37
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:35,724
[SPEAKER_06]: So tonight, as we continue to monitor the reliable advisories for COVID-19 concerns, we welcome but don't require masks.

38
00:07:36,084 --> 00:07:40,047
[SPEAKER_06]: We simply ask that you be courteous to your neighbors as we move through the evening.

39
00:07:41,068 --> 00:07:45,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Please turn your cell phones off or run them on the silent setting.

40
00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:54,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's try to avoid hip-hop ringtones, buzzers, bells, and whistles as best we can.

41
00:07:55,561 --> 00:08:13,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so thanks also to my main man Kevin Harrington from Medford Community Media for guiding us as we broadcast to you via Facebook live stream on MCM's YouTube and on local public assets channels 9 for Comcast and 47 for Verizon.

42
00:08:13,788 --> 00:08:19,710
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're out there watching on your electronic devices or your television, welcome to the show.

43
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:25,778
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's April, and that means it's National Poetry Month.

44
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Purveyors of the, yeah.

45
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:50,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Purveyors of the written verse and spoken word all over America are hitting the schools, the libraries, the corner cafes, the little theaters, and the major stages to extol the virtues of one of our oldest art forms, for the informed, the interested, the curious, and the just plain confused.

46
00:08:51,221 --> 00:08:56,564
[SPEAKER_06]: And as the first and former Poet Laureate of the City of Medford, I am excited.

47
00:08:57,165 --> 00:09:02,548
[SPEAKER_06]: And you probably knew that the written and spoken word would be the main order of the evening.

48
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:09,393
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have partners in high verbal crimes and literary misdemeanors tonight.

49
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:11,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me introduce them both to you.

50
00:09:13,235 --> 00:09:13,575
[SPEAKER_06]: C.D.

51
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:17,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Collins is the City of Malden's inaugural Poet Laureate.

52
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:32,963
[SPEAKER_06]: She was named to the post in late June and has already transformed the literary landscape with workshops, commissioned pieces, and dozens of appearances across that municipality.

53
00:09:33,603 --> 00:09:44,326
[SPEAKER_06]: She holds a BA and an MA in English literature for the University of Kentucky and has also pursued graduate studies at Harvard University's Extension Program in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

54
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:53,512
[SPEAKER_06]: where she studied under author Pamela Painter, who encouraged her to submit her stories for publication and became a mentor.

55
00:09:54,173 --> 00:10:11,645
[SPEAKER_06]: She has published a collection of short stories called Blue Land on Polio Press, and a collection of poetry, Self-Portrait with Severed Head, yes, Ibbotson Street Press, and a novel, After Heat, on Empty City Press.

56
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:25,772
[SPEAKER_06]: As one of the originators of the resurgence of spoken word with live music in Boston in the early 1990s, Collins' work is represented in five compact discs.

57
00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:33,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Her first album, Kentucky Stories, won Best Spoken Word Album at the Boston Poetry Awards, and her most recent album,

58
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:48,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Night Animals is comprised of songs and stories with her musical partner, Santone, a blind, autistic musical savant and summa cum laude graduate of the Berklee College of Music in Boston.

59
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:55,895
[SPEAKER_06]: CD's current projects include a limited edition book centered on her hometown, Mount Sterling, Kentucky.

60
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:57,956
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll hear the Kentucky come out in a minute.

61
00:10:58,556 --> 00:11:06,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Titled The Little Big Town, and her sixth compact disc of spoken word with music is entitled Camargo Rain.

62
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:16,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Her literary and musical accomplishments comprise a very long list, but suffice it to say that she is a dynamic force in contemporary poetry.

63
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:18,624
[SPEAKER_06]: CD, welcome to West Medford.

64
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:29,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Next, we have my friend and the second poet laureate of this city, Vijaya Sundaram.

65
00:11:30,634 --> 00:11:35,958
[SPEAKER_06]: She has been with us on several occasions, and we're thrilled to have her back in the building.

66
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:41,582
[SPEAKER_06]: A native of India, Vijaya has lived in Medford, Massachusetts for a number of years.

67
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:46,926
[SPEAKER_06]: She is a singer, songwriter, guitarist, poet, and writer who spent 17 years?

68
00:11:49,393 --> 00:11:53,216
[SPEAKER_06]: as an eighth grade English teacher in the Massachusetts Public Schools.

69
00:11:53,856 --> 00:11:59,360
[SPEAKER_06]: She is now a full professor of English Lit at Bunker Hill Community College.

70
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:06,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Her literary exploits are also extensive, and Medford is quickly discovering her many talents.

71
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:12,924
[SPEAKER_06]: She's been published in a number of literary magazines, such as Calliope and the Phoenix Rising Review.

72
00:12:13,464 --> 00:12:23,766
[SPEAKER_06]: She has also released her first collection of poetry, entitled Fractured Lens, on Savannah Bonnevard Press.

73
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:24,786
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it.

74
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:25,786
[SPEAKER_06]: It's wonderful.

75
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:26,767
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get it.

76
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,107
[SPEAKER_06]: We got it right here.

77
00:12:29,327 --> 00:12:44,343
[SPEAKER_06]: So in addition to her teaching duties, Vijaya has also been busy presenting workshops, sharing her songs and poems, writing for special occasions here in Medford, and continuing to bring poetry into the city's public spaces.

78
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:47,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Please welcome back Vijaya Sundaram.

79
00:12:51,627 --> 00:13:04,038
[SPEAKER_06]: So the bottom line in all of this, I believe that the visual artist, the sculptor, the craftsperson, the singer-songwriter, the poet, the playwright, the musician, the designer, the actor, the grid, all of us,

80
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:14,092
[SPEAKER_06]: are simply trying to tell our story in the best way we know how, with the humble gifts we possess in a good and charitable universe.

81
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:22,800
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the most optimistic and forward-looking way that I can state it, but it's not always that hopeful and bright.

82
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:31,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Nonetheless, let me begin our conversation tonight with a bit of poetic bite, and we'll see where it lands.

83
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:32,508
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to read a piece.

84
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:41,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Kill the poets first.

85
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:47,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Kill the poets first, for they will tell the truth and shame the devil in all of us.

86
00:13:47,897 --> 00:13:53,579
[SPEAKER_06]: They will highlight the lack of honor among thieves with assonance, alliteration, and clever metaphor.

87
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Put them in shackles and parade them through the public square.

88
00:13:57,561 --> 00:13:59,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Strip them naked, if you dare.

89
00:14:00,302 --> 00:14:08,385
[SPEAKER_06]: They will expose the libertarian as a libertine amid the piles of gluttony, hubris, pride, and prejudice that lie at his gout-ridden feet.

90
00:14:09,185 --> 00:14:18,927
[SPEAKER_06]: They will rightly divide the gospel in ways that the jackleg and the profligate and the snake oil purveyor conflate, confuse, and contradict at every pulpit and podium.

91
00:14:19,747 --> 00:14:31,330
[SPEAKER_06]: They will measure with meter the length of the bigot's bloodline, the strength of the captor's confine, the mark of the beastly revenant, the lies who prove most fraudulent, the truth that they seek to circumvent.

92
00:14:32,475 --> 00:14:33,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Kill the poets first.

93
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:48,832
[SPEAKER_06]: For their lyrics, like fine opera, will peel away the lie and tear down the malice and point out the mayhem in rhyming couplets and pecan haiku and epic odes and hip hop for the homeboys.

94
00:14:49,272 --> 00:14:54,997
[SPEAKER_06]: with their black lives matter and their save the planet and their no justice, no peace.

95
00:14:55,337 --> 00:15:07,128
[SPEAKER_06]: They will roll the bedrocks of the right wing of the rabbit racist and the reluctant witness back down the mountains we've scaled like the Sisyphus stone over and over and over again.

96
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:19,718
[SPEAKER_06]: killed the poets first, by the bullet in the ballot, by the garret in the glock and the guillotine in the gas chamber, by a thousand disappearing acts and a hundred hidden dungeons, by the noose from the bow of an ancient oak.

97
00:15:20,358 --> 00:15:29,765
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the ultimate attention getter, a foolproof message sender, greater in gore than any artist can render, crucifixion for the commoner and the crusader.

98
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:32,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Own no allegiance to the song.

99
00:15:32,628 --> 00:15:34,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Vow not to the charming verses.

100
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Smile not at the fragrant lyric.

101
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:39,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Hide not the pretty sonnet in the bowels of your heart of darkness.

102
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:41,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Kill them first.

103
00:15:42,155 --> 00:15:43,115
[SPEAKER_06]: They will trick you.

104
00:15:43,696 --> 00:15:47,379
[SPEAKER_06]: You will feel the pangs of your lost humanity welling up in your bosom.

105
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:54,103
[SPEAKER_06]: They will convict you, make you want to buy back your soul from the long-departed demons who made you crave sin.

106
00:15:54,904 --> 00:16:01,970
[SPEAKER_06]: They will be the straw that breaks your camel's loyal back and causes your beast of burden to spur in the desert of your depravity.

107
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't let them hold a mirror to your faces.

108
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:10,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't let them shine on shameful, don't let their light shine on shameful places.

109
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:14,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't let them put your hounds through their paces.

110
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:17,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't let their judges handle your cases.

111
00:16:18,402 --> 00:16:19,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Kill the poets.

112
00:16:19,823 --> 00:16:20,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Kill the poets.

113
00:16:21,124 --> 00:16:22,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Kill the poets first.

114
00:16:32,749 --> 00:16:34,931
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's go.

115
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:37,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do this.

116
00:16:38,794 --> 00:16:40,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Arcee, I'm going to start with you.

117
00:16:41,177 --> 00:16:46,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you tell us a bit about your journey from Kentucky to Malden, Massachusetts?

118
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:50,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, OK, so I was running away from home.

119
00:16:51,505 --> 00:16:59,112
[SPEAKER_04]: And I needed to get about 1,000 miles away to get perspective on Kentucky.

120
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:15,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I became an ambassador from the South not knowing I was even Southern before I moved up here and was taking a class at Harvard and I opened my mouth and everybody was like, be quiet.

121
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:17,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think she's going to be able to make a sentence.

122
00:17:18,601 --> 00:17:20,102
[SPEAKER_04]: There's unbelievable

123
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:22,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Prejudice still.

124
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:31,365
[SPEAKER_04]: And people think, well, I flew from New York to Los Angeles, and I looked out the plane window, and I saw what was going on down there.

125
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:36,089
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all solid red, and it's a lot more complicated than that.

126
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:45,357
[SPEAKER_04]: So I ended up being an ambassador for Kentucky, representing the multiple voices there, the people that don't have voices there.

127
00:17:46,017 --> 00:17:49,840
[SPEAKER_04]: and I found Malden, and Malden adopted me.

128
00:17:49,860 --> 00:18:09,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I was available for adoption, and they adopted me, and they have affordable housing, Artist Lofts, it was a convent, and I don't know where the nuns are, they're like, we're tired, so they renovated it into Artist Lofts, and that's where it is, it's beautiful, Sacred Heart Parish.

129
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:13,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, fantastic, fantastic.

130
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:14,275
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get back to that.

131
00:18:14,355 --> 00:18:19,141
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to give Vijaya the same opportunity in a different way.

132
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:21,404
[SPEAKER_06]: What brought you here from India?

133
00:18:21,424 --> 00:18:28,813
[SPEAKER_06]: And how was it settling into the greater Boston area for you?

134
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:48,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember we talked about this in a previous incarnation here, but for this audience, I came to India in 1988, in December of that year, and with my husband, Warren Sanders, and the two of us were broke and young and newly married.

135
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:52,911
[SPEAKER_02]: We came here because we'd just gotten married in India and his parents wanted to see us.

136
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,833
[SPEAKER_02]: So we came to visit.

137
00:18:55,253 --> 00:19:00,798
[SPEAKER_02]: But his father very quickly convinced us to get me a green card.

138
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that time, I had no plan to stay.

139
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:04,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I had my job.

140
00:19:04,622 --> 00:19:06,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on leave of absence from my job in India.

141
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:08,526
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had promised to hold it for me.

142
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:12,430
[SPEAKER_02]: But my father-in-law said, nonsense, in his characteristic way.

143
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,472
[SPEAKER_02]: And he kept me here.

144
00:19:14,552 --> 00:19:15,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he didn't keep me here.

145
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:17,635
[SPEAKER_02]: My husband and I made a lovely life here.

146
00:19:18,295 --> 00:19:29,357
[SPEAKER_02]: And both of us are musicians, and we toiled through the temp jobs and the warehouse working jobs that I did at Rounder Records and all sorts of other things.

147
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:33,258
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember my father said, you have a master's in literature.

148
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:34,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you teach?

149
00:19:34,218 --> 00:19:35,798
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, oh, this is America.

150
00:19:35,818 --> 00:19:36,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know anything.

151
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:39,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to start right at the bottom, as most immigrants do.

152
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:40,259
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did.

153
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,120
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I picked, packed, and shipped records on the floor

154
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,941
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely hard floor of Rounder Records.

155
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:51,483
[SPEAKER_02]: And that I did for about a year and a half.

156
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:55,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I became crew chief and then I became production assistant and legal assistant.

157
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:58,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew nothing about the law, but I became a legal assistant because they wanted one.

158
00:19:59,387 --> 00:20:03,429
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I became all kinds of assistants and I said, I'm tired of this business.

159
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:04,949
[SPEAKER_02]: And I loved Rounder.

160
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:05,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved working there.

161
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,070
[SPEAKER_02]: We were all

162
00:20:07,211 --> 00:20:09,512
[SPEAKER_02]: wannabe music stars.

163
00:20:09,672 --> 00:20:11,894
[SPEAKER_02]: None of us became music stars.

164
00:20:11,954 --> 00:20:14,896
[SPEAKER_02]: We just loved music, and we served the cause.

165
00:20:15,036 --> 00:20:17,098
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really an eccentric place.

166
00:20:17,158 --> 00:20:21,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I had my education there, my first education of this country there.

167
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:25,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember coming home, crying, saying, I hate this country.

168
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's using swear words.

169
00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:33,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I had grown up in a convent, not in a convent, but I went to a day school, convent school in India.

170
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know the F word.

171
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:36,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never heard it.

172
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:38,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in my 20s.

173
00:20:38,953 --> 00:20:39,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never heard it.

174
00:20:40,474 --> 00:20:43,596
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was an innocent, and I quickly became depraved.

175
00:20:45,618 --> 00:20:52,662
[SPEAKER_02]: But so, you know, I got tired of it after a while and went to Lesley University.

176
00:20:53,283 --> 00:20:56,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it was Lesley College, and I got my master's in education, and then

177
00:20:57,245 --> 00:21:02,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Immediately after that, I got a job teaching in the public school where I stayed for 17 years.

178
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:05,270
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the people here is from that place.

179
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Becky.

180
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:08,712
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was something.

181
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:10,594
[SPEAKER_02]: But that job was exhausting.

182
00:21:10,654 --> 00:21:12,955
[SPEAKER_02]: After 17 years, you just give, give, give, give, give.

183
00:21:12,975 --> 00:21:13,796
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have no time.

184
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:15,437
[SPEAKER_02]: You're dying of exhaustion.

185
00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:16,557
[SPEAKER_02]: So I stopped.

186
00:21:16,637 --> 00:21:18,278
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, that is enough.

187
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:20,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And I homeschooled my daughter.

188
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I had been doing it from the beginning.

189
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:23,562
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did it full time.

190
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:25,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the urge to teach.

191
00:21:25,623 --> 00:21:28,406
[SPEAKER_02]: came again and I joined Bunker Hill Community College.

192
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:30,348
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my entire life story here.

193
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:35,572
[SPEAKER_02]: As an adjunct and then became full-time.

194
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an actual assistant professor, that's the low rung.

195
00:21:38,435 --> 00:21:40,217
[SPEAKER_02]: And you become full professor after six years.

196
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:43,160
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm on the lower rungs of that.

197
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,601
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, full-time.

198
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:46,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on the tenure track, so that's good.

199
00:21:47,003 --> 00:21:58,406
[SPEAKER_02]: So my husband and I moved from Arlington to Medford in the year 2001, just a month before 9-11 happened.

200
00:21:58,466 --> 00:21:59,466
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've lived there ever since.

201
00:22:00,226 --> 00:22:01,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember thinking, what a big house.

202
00:22:02,347 --> 00:22:05,268
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very normal, ordinary, middle-income house.

203
00:22:05,528 --> 00:22:06,488
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, that was huge.

204
00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:11,689
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, maybe I can hide a refugee family in the Attica and another refugee family up there.

205
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:14,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I was heartbroken when the Afghan war began.

206
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,411
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a different story.

207
00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:16,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

208
00:22:16,991 --> 00:22:17,992
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lived there for a long time.

209
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:18,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

210
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:19,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Long story short.

211
00:22:19,073 --> 00:22:19,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

212
00:22:19,453 --> 00:22:19,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

213
00:22:19,853 --> 00:22:20,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

214
00:22:20,514 --> 00:22:20,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

215
00:22:21,054 --> 00:22:21,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Fantastic.

216
00:22:22,635 --> 00:22:23,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Fantastic.

217
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:29,720
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have former and current three Poet Laureates in the room.

218
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,962
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to get this anyplace else.

219
00:22:32,022 --> 00:22:33,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just telling you right now.

220
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:40,888
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to ask you, Sidi, how are you enjoying your new role as Malden's first Poet Laureate?

221
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:50,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Gary Christensen, the mayor, he called me, he said, okay, we have selected you as the Poet Laureate.

222
00:22:51,427 --> 00:22:55,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Your first assignment is due in two days, and you're going to

223
00:22:57,017 --> 00:23:00,540
[SPEAKER_04]: write a poem for the Malden High School graduating class.

224
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,223
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has to be very specific about them.

225
00:23:03,943 --> 00:23:07,126
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, I need like five months for an occasional poem.

226
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, I'll see you Sunday.

227
00:23:09,408 --> 00:23:14,152
[SPEAKER_04]: So we, can you die of writing a poem, you know, like 48 hours later?

228
00:23:15,453 --> 00:23:18,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I go in and deliver the poem, and they're incredible.

229
00:23:18,495 --> 00:23:26,499
[SPEAKER_04]: The graduating class, just unbelievable, huge class, and I felt a very warm welcome from them.

230
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,341
[SPEAKER_04]: One idea that I had was to teach workshops.

231
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:35,303
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very diverse town, as you know, and to go to different

232
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:55,920
[SPEAKER_04]: organizations and offer my services to teach workshops and then I gave a Presentation for City Council you guys want me to do a poem for you call me and I'll do a poem and I did a poem this morning because we had a grand opening of the bike kitchen and

233
00:23:56,781 --> 00:24:00,725
[SPEAKER_04]: And the bike kitchen is, you can go, you can take your bike.

234
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:02,987
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's a, what are those things called?

235
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:05,469
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a, it's like a tin box.

236
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:08,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's kind of like a, a trailer in context.

237
00:24:09,613 --> 00:24:15,498
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is, they, you can go there and they, they fix your bike for next to nothing.

238
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:17,079
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, I did a poem there.

239
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Wherever they want me, I shall go.

240
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:19,641
[SPEAKER_04]: This is it.

241
00:24:19,742 --> 00:24:20,162
[SPEAKER_04]: This is it.

242
00:24:20,402 --> 00:24:36,316
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did want to say that I taught high school also, and at one point, one of my students came up, and she looked like Carrie Fisher in Star Wars, and she just had this look, and she goes, it's time for you to go be a writer.

243
00:24:37,377 --> 00:24:40,760
[SPEAKER_04]: We've loved having you go be a writer.

244
00:24:41,441 --> 00:24:46,005
[SPEAKER_04]: So I took a year's leave of absence from Kentucky, from teaching, and then I stayed.

245
00:24:47,006 --> 00:24:50,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, wow, fantastic, fantastic.

246
00:24:51,387 --> 00:25:07,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Quick story, so I have been, you know, snooping around in Malden for a couple years now, you know, and, you know, they have asked me to come and do a couple of things, and so I've gotten to be, you know, if not friends, at least good acquaintances with Gary, and he says to me, we're getting one of you.

247
00:25:09,142 --> 00:25:14,787
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, well, I don't know if you can get one of me per se, but you can definitely get a Poet Laureate.

248
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:21,332
[SPEAKER_06]: And I told him, I said, and if you need any help in terms of process or anything like that, I'll help you.

249
00:25:21,412 --> 00:25:28,978
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I had anything to do at all with you becoming the Poet Laureate of Malden, I'm better for it.

250
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,582
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, and you are highly regarded in Malden.

251
00:25:32,923 --> 00:25:33,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I stay out of trouble there.

252
00:25:34,024 --> 00:25:36,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, your name is on everyone's lips, you know, it really is.

253
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:38,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, thank you very much.

254
00:25:38,589 --> 00:25:40,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Vijaya, so... And you too, coming up.

255
00:25:40,852 --> 00:25:41,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

256
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:47,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Your first year as the second Poet Laureate of Medford, what's it been like for you so far?

257
00:25:48,945 --> 00:25:49,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

258
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:51,347
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

259
00:25:52,728 --> 00:25:53,849
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been great.

260
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:55,931
[SPEAKER_02]: The first few months, I didn't have much to do.

261
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:59,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, except you called me, and you interviewed me, and a couple of people interviewed me.

262
00:26:00,675 --> 00:26:02,676
[SPEAKER_02]: But then in January, everything took off.

263
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:03,277
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

264
00:26:03,297 --> 00:26:07,941
[SPEAKER_02]: So the mayoral inauguration, I had to write an occasion poem.

265
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:10,962
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had never done poetry on demand.

266
00:26:11,843 --> 00:26:13,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had the same panic.

267
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:17,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I literally wrote it three days before it was meant to be read.

268
00:26:17,265 --> 00:26:18,826
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was really happy with it.

269
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:19,406
[SPEAKER_07]: It was beautiful.

270
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:20,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed writing it.

271
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:22,788
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought, OK, because you have to write.

272
00:26:23,846 --> 00:26:27,088
[SPEAKER_02]: and be true to your voice, you cannot fake it.

273
00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:34,593
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to connect it to what's happening and you want to inspire along the way and feel inspired.

274
00:26:35,133 --> 00:26:36,534
[SPEAKER_02]: It should not be a drudgery.

275
00:26:36,634 --> 00:26:38,075
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be something lovely for you.

276
00:26:38,755 --> 00:26:40,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything you look back on, anything you produce,

277
00:26:41,437 --> 00:26:42,557
[SPEAKER_02]: you should feel happy about.

278
00:26:42,617 --> 00:26:43,818
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to do that.

279
00:26:44,018 --> 00:26:46,218
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a really great lesson.

280
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:49,499
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had to write a poem for the Martin Luther King Jr.

281
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:50,039
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.

282
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,001
[SPEAKER_02]: And that too, I had so much fun writing for the occasion, had not done that.

283
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:56,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one for the Community Preservation Act.

284
00:26:56,661 --> 00:27:00,142
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my college called me and asked me to do one for Black History Month.

285
00:27:00,502 --> 00:27:01,323
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wrote one for that.

286
00:27:02,463 --> 00:27:09,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I read the one that I wrote for your occasion on that occasion.

287
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,752
[SPEAKER_02]: But mostly I wrote everything on demand.

288
00:27:11,812 --> 00:27:12,673
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.

289
00:27:13,354 --> 00:27:15,155
[SPEAKER_02]: And recently I started a workshop

290
00:27:18,493 --> 00:27:21,475
[SPEAKER_02]: call it Poetry Club for adults and for teens.

291
00:27:21,735 --> 00:27:23,636
[SPEAKER_02]: The teens have not shown up, and it's my fault.

292
00:27:23,716 --> 00:27:24,917
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Friday, who's going to come?

293
00:27:25,297 --> 00:27:27,298
[SPEAKER_02]: But the grown-ups are starting to come in.

294
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:30,400
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had three or four at each point, and they're coming.

295
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:34,762
[SPEAKER_02]: And next time I do this, next semester, I might change the day.

296
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:36,583
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that'll be good.

297
00:27:36,944 --> 00:27:37,604
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's been fun.

298
00:27:37,644 --> 00:27:38,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I've really enjoyed it.

299
00:27:38,304 --> 00:27:38,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.

300
00:27:38,565 --> 00:27:39,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you're enjoying it.

301
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:40,606
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you're enjoying it.

302
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:43,908
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard nothing but good things about your tenure thus far.

303
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:47,632
[SPEAKER_06]: CD, so I am going to prevail upon you.

304
00:27:49,615 --> 00:27:57,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk a little bit first about your focus, you know, what you're focused on writing these days, and then will you read a few pieces for us?

305
00:28:00,874 --> 00:28:08,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I write like a, like a crazy person and just it comes out and I don't know what it's gonna be.

306
00:28:08,724 --> 00:28:16,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I write like that and then it comes out this big mess and then I bring in the critic and I revise it.

307
00:28:17,254 --> 00:28:33,186
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I, I write on many subjects, but I, I did realize that, that I am, even though I ran away, I'm a child of, of my hometown and of Kentucky, and I do want to represent it.

308
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:39,371
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I want to say also, we found out we could write occasional poems.

309
00:28:39,671 --> 00:28:40,232
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't know.

310
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:42,653
[SPEAKER_04]: We found out.

311
00:28:43,194 --> 00:28:43,734
[SPEAKER_04]: So shall I?

312
00:28:43,754 --> 00:28:44,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

313
00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:50,492
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I think I need to take off my, I need to get ready for this.

314
00:28:57,859 --> 00:29:12,672
[SPEAKER_04]: A decade from now, when everyone works either for Starbucks or Amazon, when Jeff Bezos has been coronated king, I'll be down south in a compound like Jim Jones or David Koresh.

315
00:29:13,522 --> 00:29:22,391
[SPEAKER_04]: except my followers will be nomadic cats who smoke burly wood pipes and tattered dogs who never get dental checkups.

316
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:30,880
[SPEAKER_04]: And my religion will be horticulture, carrots, sweet corn, and bush beans called Kentucky Wonders.

317
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:46,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I will sit cross-legged and watch the sunset flare unnatural but gorgeous colors like a deer flame log which burns for hours, consumes itself without an ash, and I'll talk to my father.

318
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:53,011
[SPEAKER_04]: What I really want to say is that I miss my father's vegetable beef soup.

319
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Always a pot full.

320
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:59,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Or brown beans and cornbread fried in a cast iron skillet.

321
00:29:59,997 --> 00:30:00,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Plenty.

322
00:30:00,957 --> 00:30:03,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Always made sure we had something good to eat.

323
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:04,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Not mom.

324
00:30:05,341 --> 00:30:15,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Her basic food groups, Sara Lee's cinnamon wedges, drip grind coffee, Jack Daniels and Kent's cigarettes, gathering in ashes as long as a philosopher's forefinger.

325
00:30:16,997 --> 00:30:20,580
[SPEAKER_04]: My dad ate his soup in the den, listening to Rush Limbaugh.

326
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,823
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't like the look of his dentures that student at the medical center made.

327
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:29,567
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd been so handsome, strong, built half the houses in town.

328
00:30:30,447 --> 00:30:40,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Dined privately now, then came out to where my mother and I talked at the cherry dining room table and repeated everything Rush said, wheezing with laughter.

329
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:43,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Rush's jokes hit him like a two-by-four.

330
00:30:44,103 --> 00:30:47,285
[SPEAKER_04]: My mother would fire rebuttals as she scanned the seed catalog.

331
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:52,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Black tulips from Holland, purple string beans and blue potatoes.

332
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:57,293
[SPEAKER_04]: She could defeat Rush Limbaugh without a pause in her page-turning, and that was the reason he did it.

333
00:30:58,073 --> 00:31:03,437
[SPEAKER_04]: To hear that back talk, to Rilas, to him, this was a good time.

334
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:05,439
[SPEAKER_04]: This was conversation.

335
00:31:06,636 --> 00:31:11,642
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no malicious intent when he said, I got to go meet one of my secretaries now.

336
00:31:12,323 --> 00:31:16,928
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to a militia meeting over at Ruby Ridge, and I'm expecting Stormy Daniels at 3.

337
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Just tell her to wait in the den.

338
00:31:20,393 --> 00:31:25,760
[SPEAKER_04]: What I really want to say is that I shopped for bones in Star Market in Cambridge.

339
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:32,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Beef bones sawed with a sharp blade on a January day so cold spit froze in the air.

340
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:37,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Wind boomerang words back into my mouth and burned my skin like a flat iron.

341
00:31:38,902 --> 00:31:47,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Though I'm vegetarian, I bought four bones, which I roasted in a pan while sautéing onions, carrots, mushrooms in the big Dutch oven.

342
00:31:48,591 --> 00:32:02,524
[SPEAKER_04]: I deglazed the bones with good red wine from Italy, added to the soup lime with the herbs, chopped tomatoes, barley, simmered it for a few hours to let the flavors blend, carried it to the new house, and fed the carpenters.

343
00:32:04,161 --> 00:32:09,144
[SPEAKER_04]: What I really want to say is that I don't know who I am anymore.

344
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:17,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I have reabsorbed like mist into the ocean, shattered like the window in the witch's house, the one made of purple candy.

345
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I never knew how fragile, how brittle, how easily lost.

346
00:32:23,773 --> 00:32:33,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I carry this loss like cotton candy spun with pink light inside my chest, insubstantial instead of heart meat, lungs like bagpipes.

347
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel the hollow on a trail after someone leaving in the snow.

348
00:32:37,642 --> 00:32:39,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't go.

349
00:32:39,563 --> 00:32:45,147
[SPEAKER_04]: A hole like a hollow nose bullet through the third chakra, the sun, the self.

350
00:32:45,948 --> 00:32:47,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Hollow nose, small at the entrance.

351
00:32:47,949 --> 00:32:49,650
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to blow your whole back.

352
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:55,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I fall into the deep, cold skies searching for my father in a blue star.

353
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I will ask him questions.

354
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,050
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you do, dad?

355
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,791
[SPEAKER_04]: And he'll say, stand up for yourself.

356
00:33:00,191 --> 00:33:01,651
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to take any crap.

357
00:33:01,971 --> 00:33:03,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell them all where to go.

358
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen my father crawl up a man like a panther.

359
00:33:09,152 --> 00:33:12,333
[SPEAKER_04]: My 5'7 father up a 6'3 man because he's stuck by the man.

360
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:15,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Bailed him out of jail, giving him a job, seeing him through.

361
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:18,714
[SPEAKER_04]: And he didn't like to be betrayed the way the man done him.

362
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:23,270
[SPEAKER_04]: My father's absence is a betrayal, too.

363
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Death is an absence I'm bound to forgive.

364
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:50,095
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd always been remote, seemed closer now in the bone marrow, in the recipes written in blue ballpoint on yellow legal pads, in the seed packets that arrive in February, square, colorful, spread across the cherry dining room table like candy promised to a little girl.

365
00:34:02,978 --> 00:34:07,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really know what to say, but I feel like I'm supposed to say something.

366
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:27,764
[SPEAKER_06]: The imagery, your cadence, the way that you, you know, marry the poem as you're speaking it is wonderful, and I'm speechless.

367
00:34:27,844 --> 00:34:28,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Malden got a good one.

368
00:34:29,858 --> 00:34:30,218
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

369
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:32,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Malden got a good one.

370
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who else was out there, but they got a good one.

371
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:37,062
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, very good.

372
00:34:37,102 --> 00:34:40,164
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to come back to you, Vijaya.

373
00:34:40,184 --> 00:34:45,567
[SPEAKER_06]: How can I follow it up?

374
00:34:45,647 --> 00:34:46,028
[SPEAKER_06]: You can.

375
00:34:46,088 --> 00:34:46,448
[SPEAKER_06]: You can.

376
00:34:46,508 --> 00:34:46,888
[SPEAKER_06]: You can.

377
00:34:46,988 --> 00:34:47,388
[SPEAKER_06]: You can.

378
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:54,252
[SPEAKER_06]: First, what do you have on the horizon?

379
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:58,475
[SPEAKER_06]: What kinds of things are you looking to do, wanting to do, hoping to do?

380
00:35:01,423 --> 00:35:02,464
[SPEAKER_06]: In poetry, yeah.

381
00:35:03,324 --> 00:35:04,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in life, it's the same.

382
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:19,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I've recently become a part of Mothers Out Front, and I attended one of their meetings today, and they said, do you have any ideas?

383
00:35:19,814 --> 00:35:37,542
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, why can't we have an open mic at the New Arts Collaborative place and find out if I can, you know, get the space, and have young people and old and middle-aged come and perform poems and songs, any number of things, speeches, relating to but not

384
00:35:38,702 --> 00:35:45,270
[SPEAKER_02]: not exclusively, to climate change and climate change awareness.

385
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:53,339
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to somehow bring in my various selves into this, the activist self, the poet self, the teacher, the...

386
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:54,920
[SPEAKER_02]: all of these.

387
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,701
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to figure out what the next step is.

388
00:35:58,221 --> 00:36:02,002
[SPEAKER_02]: And today when I had that idea on that Zoom call, they were thrilled with it.

389
00:36:02,082 --> 00:36:16,987
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought, okay, I'm going to start approaching various places in Medford and elsewhere and see whether they'll hold open mics and maybe infiltrate colleges and, you know, and do stuff with poetry and the spoken word and speeches relating to

390
00:36:19,433 --> 00:36:20,634
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, not exclusively.

391
00:36:20,714 --> 00:36:21,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Exclusively.

392
00:36:21,534 --> 00:36:23,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Exclusive to climate change.

393
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:23,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.

394
00:36:23,635 --> 00:36:24,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Awareness, yeah.

395
00:36:24,235 --> 00:36:25,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful, sounds like a great idea.

396
00:36:25,815 --> 00:36:26,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

397
00:36:26,195 --> 00:36:26,696
[SPEAKER_06]: A great idea.

398
00:36:26,756 --> 00:36:28,636
[SPEAKER_06]: So can I prevail upon you to read for us?

399
00:36:28,876 --> 00:36:30,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let me see.

400
00:36:30,657 --> 00:36:33,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I have here a book of mine.

401
00:36:34,298 --> 00:36:36,339
[SPEAKER_02]: My only book, I should be specific.

402
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:44,582
[SPEAKER_02]: The only book I've got so far, and you'd think at this age I would have many, but I was kinda shy and didn't push myself very much.

403
00:36:45,482 --> 00:36:48,707
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't think I'm shy listening to the way I talk, but I am actually.

404
00:36:48,727 --> 00:36:51,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I hold myself back, but I'm not doing that anymore.

405
00:36:51,551 --> 00:36:52,472
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

406
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:53,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, thank you.

407
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:54,575
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

408
00:36:55,557 --> 00:36:56,358
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have...

409
00:36:58,908 --> 00:37:00,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had memorized my poems.

410
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,069
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I used to do that when I was young, but I haven't done that.

411
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:03,889
[SPEAKER_02]: You're inspiring me.

412
00:37:04,729 --> 00:37:05,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

413
00:37:05,249 --> 00:37:07,249
[SPEAKER_05]: God bless you both, because I ain't even trying it.

414
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:08,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.

415
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,510
[SPEAKER_05]: If it ain't written in the book, I can't do it.

416
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:12,430
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

417
00:37:14,511 --> 00:37:20,432
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is titled On Listening to Dido's or Dido's Lament for the Nth Time.

418
00:37:22,452 --> 00:37:25,493
[SPEAKER_02]: It's by Henry Purcell, the piece.

419
00:37:25,753 --> 00:37:27,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And the poem is, of course, my homage to him.

420
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:39,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does hearing a song about a story in Greek and Latin mythosphere then retold in English make me, an Indian woman, weep?

421
00:37:40,318 --> 00:37:44,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Purcell makes my pulse dissolve in a sea of sadness.

422
00:37:45,603 --> 00:37:47,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I come from the land of loss and suffering.

423
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:50,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I come from the land of mythology and dreams.

424
00:37:51,428 --> 00:38:03,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I come from the land where mythological princes went into exile, lost their loves, learned about suffering, found God in the midst of it all, returned to their love, or had their love returned to them.

425
00:38:04,438 --> 00:38:05,659
[SPEAKER_02]: There was hope there.

426
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:10,823
[SPEAKER_02]: This song is pure sorrow, and pure sorrow is hard to bear.

427
00:38:12,216 --> 00:38:18,348
[SPEAKER_02]: We hide behind hope, tremble behind tropes, cliches, happy endings to stories that we seek.

428
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:20,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Hungry for something we know not what.

429
00:38:22,102 --> 00:38:28,126
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that in the end, such endings are scant, for everything ends in death, even love.

430
00:38:29,187 --> 00:38:40,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet Dido sings, broken, burning with love and betrayal, giving up all for one who deserves nothing, a narcissistic, uncaring ass.

431
00:38:41,776 --> 00:38:48,581
[SPEAKER_02]: There is something beautiful, something unjust, something absurd, unfair, unbearable about such love.

432
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:53,924
[SPEAKER_02]: It has nothing to do with the man she loves and everything to do with Dido.

433
00:38:54,944 --> 00:38:56,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's your dignity, woman?

434
00:38:56,705 --> 00:38:59,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to cry out to her across time and mythos.

435
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:05,389
[SPEAKER_02]: You undo all that women should be, I want to tell her, my voice stern and accusing.

436
00:39:08,134 --> 00:39:10,656
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another part, though, where I admire her.

437
00:39:11,657 --> 00:39:20,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I will never emulate her, but I ask myself often, what must it be like to turn to ashes with lust to die for love?

438
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:22,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic.

439
00:39:23,526 --> 00:39:24,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic, really.

440
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:29,199
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is good.

441
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:29,840
[SPEAKER_06]: This is good.

442
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have to do much.

443
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have to sit here and direct.

444
00:39:33,342 --> 00:39:33,702
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

445
00:39:34,143 --> 00:39:40,067
[SPEAKER_06]: So this question, and I want you both to read again, but I want to ask a couple of other questions.

446
00:39:41,808 --> 00:39:43,689
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll ask you both the same question here.

447
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:53,696
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you most want our younger generations, particularly those that want to be and grow artistically, to recognize?

448
00:39:56,417 --> 00:39:57,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I want them to read.

449
00:39:59,563 --> 00:39:59,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

450
00:40:01,283 --> 00:40:05,346
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want them to, as we all want, them to go outside.

451
00:40:06,426 --> 00:40:11,830
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like right now I'm trying to save my farm.

452
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:19,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a farm in Kentucky and I'm trying to save it from chemical agriculture and getting that out of it.

453
00:40:19,775 --> 00:40:29,942
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I went to, in the city we don't always, we sometimes forget that when it rains it's not a bad thing.

454
00:40:30,062 --> 00:40:31,003
[SPEAKER_04]: It's why we're alive.

455
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:43,148
[SPEAKER_04]: and that we need to keep water in the land, we need to save our planet in such a strong, urgent way, and to feel that.

456
00:40:43,168 --> 00:40:44,809
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a couple of things.

457
00:40:44,949 --> 00:40:46,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, they're good things, good things.

458
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Vijaya, young people.

459
00:40:49,351 --> 00:40:51,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I echo everything that you said.

460
00:40:51,091 --> 00:40:54,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel the same way, to read and to care about the planet.

461
00:40:55,503 --> 00:40:57,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want them to be kinder.

462
00:40:58,384 --> 00:41:00,745
[SPEAKER_02]: They are very judgmental, am I wrong?

463
00:41:01,346 --> 00:41:06,808
[SPEAKER_02]: They seem more judgmental, but you know when I think back on when I was young, I too was judgmental.

464
00:41:07,128 --> 00:41:13,911
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it changes as we get older, and I want them to forgive those whom they disagree with.

465
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:22,334
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are a lot of people they cancel because of some view they hold or some other view they hold, and they never seem to want to

466
00:41:23,866 --> 00:41:28,471
[SPEAKER_02]: accommodate the wholeness of a person, at least the certain age group that I have seen.

467
00:41:28,491 --> 00:41:33,758
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want them to understand that a human is complex, and that there's a lot to us.

468
00:41:34,218 --> 00:41:39,404
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are some bad parts, and there are some good parts, and learn to not be so unforgiving.

469
00:41:40,586 --> 00:41:43,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm sounding really stern about this, but am I?

470
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:44,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it ring a bell?

471
00:41:45,427 --> 00:41:46,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.

472
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:47,728
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like Oscar Wilde said, right?

473
00:41:47,908 --> 00:41:49,468
[SPEAKER_02]: When children are young, what is it?

474
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:56,530
[SPEAKER_02]: They love their parents, then they something, and then rarely do they forgive them.

475
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they understand them, rarely, if ever, do they forgive them.

476
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:01,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm misquoting, but that's the gist of it.

477
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:09,393
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what we need to do is to learn to help them to, I'm not being,

478
00:42:10,477 --> 00:42:10,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Articulate.

479
00:42:11,964 --> 00:42:13,451
[SPEAKER_02]: To teach them how to be.

480
00:42:15,071 --> 00:42:18,473
[SPEAKER_02]: complete human beings, and I think maybe we don't even need to do that.

481
00:42:18,513 --> 00:42:23,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they'll come to it on their own, but I wanna keep reiterating it for my young students, and I've had to do that a little.

482
00:42:24,815 --> 00:42:38,621
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of information that's very dividing, and I think that we're all vulnerable to it, and especially young people, and to realize we're humans, we're all humans, we're together.

483
00:42:38,781 --> 00:42:41,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, it was beautiful what you said.

484
00:42:41,463 --> 00:42:44,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we're still at a place,

485
00:42:45,044 --> 00:42:58,204
[SPEAKER_06]: where, you know, our kids or the young people that we come into contact have not wholly formed yet, you know, intellectually, spiritually, psychologically.

486
00:42:58,812 --> 00:43:14,726
[SPEAKER_06]: and where, you know, they're so overstimulated and over-programmed, and not always well, that it's very, very difficult for them to get out of their own way when it regards things like compassion,

487
00:43:15,547 --> 00:43:21,916
[SPEAKER_06]: and tenderness, the fruit of the spirit, the Bible would call it, forgiveness, all of those things.

488
00:43:22,156 --> 00:43:31,208
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I really, what you have both said really resonates with me because as I see young people around us, I'm always thinking,

489
00:43:32,489 --> 00:43:48,437
[SPEAKER_06]: if there was just a way, I mean, if there was just a way to introduce you to some of the virtues that I grew up with and that I hope became a part of who I am as an adult now, I just think it would be so nice, you know, so nice.

490
00:43:48,977 --> 00:43:52,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Nuclear neighborhoods like West Medford were really, really good at that.

491
00:43:53,479 --> 00:44:03,503
[SPEAKER_06]: So growing up in this neighborhood made it possible for me to kind of develop the perspective that I think you're both talking about.

492
00:44:04,825 --> 00:44:09,828
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that would have happened had I grown up anywhere else.

493
00:44:10,188 --> 00:44:10,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly don't.

494
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:13,271
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for that.

495
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:19,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so another question, and this one again is for both of you before I have you read again.

496
00:44:20,776 --> 00:44:31,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the greatest lessons you've learned from your work in the literary arts, either being a writer or collaborating with other artists or writers.

497
00:44:32,546 --> 00:44:37,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to where it is a friendly environment for you.

498
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:43,814
[SPEAKER_04]: And where you are going to be welcomed, listened to, and where they want the best for you.

499
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's not true in every circle.

500
00:44:47,556 --> 00:44:50,358
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can feel it, and it's not you.

501
00:44:50,498 --> 00:44:52,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to a different place.

502
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:53,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot what your question was.

503
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,221
[SPEAKER_04]: What was your question?

504
00:44:54,981 --> 00:45:02,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how you answered it, but one of the greatest lessons, and that's a great lesson, absolutely, absolutely.

505
00:45:02,228 --> 00:45:13,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Vijay, the greatest lesson you feel like you've learned from the things that you've done, kind of in literature, around literature, with artists, and by yourself as well?

506
00:45:19,326 --> 00:45:21,088
[SPEAKER_02]: You would not think I'd be at a loss for words.

507
00:45:22,329 --> 00:45:23,310
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what I do to people.

508
00:45:25,813 --> 00:45:31,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I think engaging with other poets, for one thing, has been exceedingly inspiring for me.

509
00:45:32,601 --> 00:45:33,622
[SPEAKER_02]: It's lovely.

510
00:45:34,062 --> 00:45:36,805
[SPEAKER_02]: The community of poets is a different one from

511
00:45:37,466 --> 00:45:38,607
[SPEAKER_02]: other kinds of communities.

512
00:45:38,847 --> 00:45:43,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I'm an expert on other communities, but my sense of poets is that we love each other.

513
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:44,970
[SPEAKER_02]: We love our poetry.

514
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:46,971
[SPEAKER_02]: We love hearing different voices.

515
00:45:47,572 --> 00:45:49,212
[SPEAKER_02]: We inspire each other.

516
00:45:49,232 --> 00:45:51,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm inspired today by both of you.

517
00:45:51,994 --> 00:45:54,615
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that that's what poetry can do.

518
00:45:54,776 --> 00:45:58,958
[SPEAKER_02]: And literature, when I teach literature, I teach empathy.

519
00:45:59,158 --> 00:46:01,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, again, going back to forgiveness and understanding.

520
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I tell my students, and myself,

521
00:46:05,121 --> 00:46:06,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I ask us, why do we do this?

522
00:46:07,844 --> 00:46:10,085
[SPEAKER_02]: And through fiction, you can find the truth.

523
00:46:10,706 --> 00:46:13,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Through poetry, you can come to the spirit of things.

524
00:46:14,169 --> 00:46:17,332
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I learned that lesson over and over again.

525
00:46:17,472 --> 00:46:19,954
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the great lessons that I've learned from literature.

526
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:24,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's the they teach you as much as you teach them.

527
00:46:24,593 --> 00:46:25,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely, I love it.

528
00:46:26,194 --> 00:46:27,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I just add this?

529
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:27,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

530
00:46:27,494 --> 00:46:35,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was Malcolm Gladwell that said, the whole system is a broken system, publishing, et cetera.

531
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go 10 by 10 by 10.

532
00:46:40,322 --> 00:46:46,366
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to be on the national stage to have an impact.

533
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,227
[SPEAKER_04]: You can be talking to one person.

534
00:46:49,366 --> 00:46:50,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely, absolutely.

535
00:46:51,007 --> 00:46:54,529
[SPEAKER_06]: So while I have your attention, will you read another piece for us?

536
00:46:57,351 --> 00:46:59,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Or don't even read, just say it.

537
00:47:00,473 --> 00:47:01,554
[SPEAKER_05]: However it works for you.

538
00:47:01,874 --> 00:47:03,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to read this.

539
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:05,676
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Death by Salad.

540
00:47:07,818 --> 00:47:13,721
[SPEAKER_04]: At Kathy's Country Kitchen in Stanton, Kentucky, you start your meal with a salad.

541
00:47:14,642 --> 00:47:17,564
[SPEAKER_04]: You can choose tossed, pear,

542
00:47:19,122 --> 00:47:29,277
[SPEAKER_04]: macaroni salad, potato salad, deviled egg salad, cornbread salad, strawberry pretzel salad.

543
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:35,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Strawberry pretzel salad is a local favorite and here's how you make it.

544
00:47:36,045 --> 00:47:38,626
[SPEAKER_04]: You break up a large package of pretzels.

545
00:47:39,227 --> 00:47:44,129
[SPEAKER_04]: You melt in a stick of butter and you mix that in with your crushed pretzels.

546
00:47:44,269 --> 00:47:47,550
[SPEAKER_04]: You add a cup of nuts and a few tablespoons of sugar.

547
00:47:48,231 --> 00:47:52,813
[SPEAKER_04]: You punch all that down in a Pyrex pan and bake it for 10 minutes at 350 degrees.

548
00:47:54,413 --> 00:48:01,994
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, you make two packages of strawberry jello with as much sugar as you can possibly dissolve.

549
00:48:03,155 --> 00:48:06,475
[SPEAKER_04]: You add your frozen strawberries and you refrigerate that.

550
00:48:07,515 --> 00:48:17,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you mix a container of Cool Whip with an 8-ounce package of cream cheese and a half a cup of confectioner's sugar.

551
00:48:17,997 --> 00:48:22,238
[SPEAKER_04]: You spread that mixture evenly on top of your cooled crushed pretzels.

552
00:48:23,298 --> 00:48:29,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you pour your half-gelled jello over top of that and put it in the refrigerator to set till dinnertime.

553
00:48:30,342 --> 00:48:34,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Now people, this is not a salad.

554
00:48:35,405 --> 00:48:39,848
[SPEAKER_04]: But at Kathy's, it's on the salad list, so you might order it anyway.

555
00:48:40,869 --> 00:48:51,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you have your catfish dinner with yeast rolls or Johnny cakes, mashed potatoes with brown or white gravy, corn, pudding, and of course fried green tomatoes.

556
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:53,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's time for desserts.

557
00:48:54,132 --> 00:49:03,895
[SPEAKER_04]: There is the usual list, butterscotch cream pie, chocolate cream pie, banana pudding, and at the bottom, the actual dessert that you will choose.

558
00:49:05,196 --> 00:49:08,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Yellow cake with warm caramel sauce.

559
00:49:09,417 --> 00:49:20,920
[SPEAKER_04]: The yellow cake of Kathy's Country Kitchen has the same density and longevity as the uranium yellow cake used to make fuel for nuclear reactors

560
00:49:22,378 --> 00:49:33,110
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a half-life of about a thousand years, except that instead of being used to make a bomb or nuclear fuel, this yellow cake goes in your stomach.

561
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:37,274
[SPEAKER_04]: And once you eat it, your bliss is short-lived.

562
00:49:38,095 --> 00:49:41,279
[SPEAKER_04]: On your way back down Levee Road, you want to die.

563
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,062
[SPEAKER_04]: You swear you will never eat again.

564
00:49:44,683 --> 00:49:52,451
[SPEAKER_04]: But the next time, when your waiter says, yellow cake with caramel sauce, it's like a cat charming a bird.

565
00:49:53,392 --> 00:49:54,073
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll want it.

566
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,277
[SPEAKER_04]: And as soon as you get better, you're going to order it again.

567
00:50:05,123 --> 00:50:07,924
[SPEAKER_06]: So blissfully irreverent, absolutely.

568
00:50:07,944 --> 00:50:10,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.

569
00:50:11,946 --> 00:50:14,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Vijay, please favor us with another piece of poetry.

570
00:50:16,809 --> 00:50:22,292
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like it's going from serious to lighthearted seems to be the case here as well.

571
00:50:23,152 --> 00:50:24,193
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not in my book.

572
00:50:24,273 --> 00:50:25,994
[SPEAKER_02]: This is called How to Clean Your House.

573
00:50:28,706 --> 00:50:29,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Want a clean home?

574
00:50:30,267 --> 00:50:33,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Snatch a dustpan and brush before the thought recedes.

575
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:34,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Start the Beatles?

576
00:50:34,971 --> 00:50:35,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Rush to it.

577
00:50:35,812 --> 00:50:37,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Revolver, a white album will do.

578
00:50:37,973 --> 00:50:39,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Start at the kitchen, then stop.

579
00:50:40,155 --> 00:50:40,996
[SPEAKER_02]: A thought strikes.

580
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Dishwasher needs emptying.

581
00:50:43,198 --> 00:50:44,599
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'd do for some magic.

582
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Put dishes away.

583
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:46,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Sigh.

584
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:51,924
[SPEAKER_02]: After, while my guitar gently weeps, switch to Captain Beefheart.

585
00:50:52,384 --> 00:51:00,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden birdie swoopin' enters your sound space, all crooked, fly irregularly around like slashes of sun on steel.

586
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:08,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Midway through dishes, remember to gaze at the birds you love so much, fluttering magically, hungrily outside the kitchen window.

587
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop everything.

588
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:10,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop.

589
00:51:11,471 --> 00:51:12,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Write a poem about birds.

590
00:51:13,132 --> 00:51:16,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you include the words magical and delicate.

591
00:51:16,293 --> 00:51:17,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and don't forget exquisite.

592
00:51:18,174 --> 00:51:18,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Scratch that.

593
00:51:18,815 --> 00:51:19,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Too overdone.

594
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:28,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the hungry chickadees open up your bird feed box, scoop a couple of cupfuls, fill up that bird feeder.

595
00:51:28,282 --> 00:51:29,602
[SPEAKER_02]: There, a duty done, see?

596
00:51:30,282 --> 00:51:40,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Steal a moment to watch morning sun filter in through your circle of deep blue glass, like still waters of a tropical sea flowing still on your windowsill.

597
00:51:41,425 --> 00:51:47,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue glass with crackling lines so fine you see through to it to the other side of perfection.

598
00:51:47,947 --> 00:51:51,528
[SPEAKER_02]: You see how the flaw is perfection, frail passing?

599
00:51:52,168 --> 00:51:55,989
[SPEAKER_02]: The flaw sings beauty, opens wide like a chasm.

600
00:51:56,469 --> 00:51:58,609
[SPEAKER_02]: You fall in, enspelled.

601
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:02,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Focus for a few moments on nothing at all, so restful.

602
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:04,430
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, something too.

603
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:12,112
[SPEAKER_02]: That swings hanging from a pine branch out in the yard, which your daughter and her best friend made with a plank of wood and ropes.

604
00:52:12,592 --> 00:52:15,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Childhood has no end, save age.

605
00:52:15,653 --> 00:52:17,413
[SPEAKER_02]: And nothing's impossible in the now.

606
00:52:19,232 --> 00:52:20,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Let your eyes rest on the swing.

607
00:52:20,974 --> 00:52:23,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Go side to side, back and forth.

608
00:52:23,617 --> 00:52:26,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Will your body onto it while you watch from within your house.

609
00:52:27,341 --> 00:52:29,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel your legs push through the air.

610
00:52:29,603 --> 00:52:31,445
[SPEAKER_02]: You're free, a child for now.

611
00:52:32,266 --> 00:52:33,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, your dog needs her walk.

612
00:52:34,028 --> 00:52:35,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Remind your spouse to take her.

613
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:38,973
[SPEAKER_02]: In mid-mid-age, we or he can use the exercise.

614
00:52:40,034 --> 00:52:40,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take her out later.

615
00:52:41,636 --> 00:52:44,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Having sent away spouse and dog, remember you got cleaning to do.

616
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:53,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Sit down, bang out your poem, your meditation, a moral calling, a daily practice like breathing or playing music or eating calls you.

617
00:52:53,747 --> 00:52:56,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Make music, make poetry, stay alive.

618
00:52:56,609 --> 00:53:00,873
[SPEAKER_02]: And if someone reads, sing to her or him of what makes you dream.

619
00:53:01,353 --> 00:53:02,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Offer them some of it.

620
00:53:02,514 --> 00:53:04,056
[SPEAKER_02]: If they go away, be not sad.

621
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:06,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and yes, fold that laundry.

622
00:53:07,097 --> 00:53:08,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Start a new pile.

623
00:53:08,077 --> 00:53:10,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Clothes are so important and so annoying.

624
00:53:11,179 --> 00:53:19,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I would love to run naked through tall green grass, a slim young dryad attended by butterflies in the sunlight and mischievous fairies at night.

625
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:24,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd collect pollen on my sun-musked body, help the dying bees.

626
00:53:24,384 --> 00:53:25,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I would enrich my earth.

627
00:53:25,604 --> 00:53:32,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd sing songs to the sun and sky and shout in joy as I fall headlong into silver streams in the rain-glutted woods.

628
00:53:33,587 --> 00:53:34,587
[SPEAKER_02]: But you wouldn't.

629
00:53:35,108 --> 00:53:40,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Too shy, too self-conscious, too aware of widening middle age, too aware of what's proper.

630
00:53:40,669 --> 00:53:41,030
Damn.

631
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:43,290
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, back to the present.

632
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:45,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick up brush and dustpan.

633
00:53:45,831 --> 00:53:46,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Sigh.

634
00:53:46,691 --> 00:53:48,732
[SPEAKER_02]: But oh wait, you have to sweep first.

635
00:53:48,832 --> 00:53:50,433
[SPEAKER_02]: No vacuum for the likes of you.

636
00:53:50,733 --> 00:53:54,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Too noisy, too cumbersome, too electrical, too grey.

637
00:53:54,634 --> 00:53:56,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweep away dust from corners.

638
00:53:56,195 --> 00:53:57,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweep the floors, the stairs.

639
00:53:58,295 --> 00:53:59,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweep away chaos.

640
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:01,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Make a pile of dust and fluff.

641
00:54:01,456 --> 00:54:04,177
[SPEAKER_02]: In the living room sits a neat, shapeless sculpture.

642
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:05,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Circle it.

643
00:54:05,698 --> 00:54:06,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Admire it.

644
00:54:06,738 --> 00:54:07,598
[SPEAKER_02]: The telephone rings.

645
00:54:07,718 --> 00:54:08,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Always answer the telephone.

646
00:54:08,859 --> 00:54:10,339
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be fortune or misfortune.

647
00:54:10,579 --> 00:54:12,840
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to have a machine deliver that kind of news.

648
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,281
[SPEAKER_02]: On second thoughts, don't.

649
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:16,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be a robocall.

650
00:54:16,601 --> 00:54:16,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget it.

651
00:54:17,021 --> 00:54:17,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it ring.

652
00:54:18,042 --> 00:54:22,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Add a few more lines, cut a few, then rush out to the garden before morning wanes.

653
00:54:22,904 --> 00:54:27,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Gaze your fill on brave daffodils surviving wild weather, defiant.

654
00:54:27,685 --> 00:54:29,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Recall Wordsworth as you do.

655
00:54:29,706 --> 00:54:30,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Pleasure fills you.

656
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:35,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I awoke this morning from a dream of dancing alone.

657
00:54:35,929 --> 00:54:39,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so young, so light, and life was so free of dust.

658
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:46,394
[SPEAKER_02]: That reminds you, come back in, collect that pile, leave no speck behind, and drop it all with a sigh into the dustbin.

659
00:54:47,014 --> 00:54:47,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

660
00:54:47,554 --> 00:54:48,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Put the broom away.

661
00:54:48,655 --> 00:54:49,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Wash your hands.

662
00:54:49,775 --> 00:54:50,236
[SPEAKER_02]: You're done.

663
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:51,316
Wow.

664
00:54:52,617 --> 00:54:52,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

665
00:54:53,117 --> 00:54:53,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

666
00:54:53,818 --> 00:54:54,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

667
00:54:54,058 --> 00:55:08,746
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I decided, marvelous, marvelous, in bringing you both tonight is that I was neither going to be jealous,

668
00:55:10,772 --> 00:55:12,953
[SPEAKER_06]: or lacking confidence.

669
00:55:13,854 --> 00:55:14,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I am both right now.

670
00:55:16,655 --> 00:55:21,237
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is marvelous to behold.

671
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:23,799
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the circle of poets know.

672
00:55:24,019 --> 00:55:26,260
[SPEAKER_06]: We could literally, we could do this all night.

673
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:34,604
[SPEAKER_06]: We could do this all night, but we only have them for a couple of hours, so we've got one more bit of business to go.

674
00:55:34,644 --> 00:55:38,086
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to ask you both this closing question.

675
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:41,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Vijay, I'll start with you.

676
00:55:41,113 --> 00:55:46,389
[SPEAKER_06]: What excites you most about Medford's future as a great place for poetry?

677
00:55:52,659 --> 00:55:59,021
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Medford, as I said in one of those interviews, I think with Judy Harrington, she said, what do you like about Medford?

678
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:01,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, it's a hidden gem.

679
00:56:01,742 --> 00:56:05,543
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many artists and writers and poets.

680
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:09,425
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some of them come to my poetry workshop, but they're already accomplished writers.

681
00:56:09,985 --> 00:56:12,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really nice to see who emerges

682
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:24,490
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're not yet connected as much as we need to be, and that's why places like the Medford Arts Collaborative are doing what they're doing, and there are places coming together, people coming together in places.

683
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:32,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Medford, because of its weird geography, because of random, tacked-on, suburban,

684
00:56:33,613 --> 00:56:37,974
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't, you know, it feels like it doesn't feel connected yet.

685
00:56:38,454 --> 00:56:43,095
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel that it's coming now with so many voices and so many musicians and artists.

686
00:56:43,355 --> 00:56:44,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm amazed at what we have.

687
00:56:45,035 --> 00:56:46,035
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, I'm hopeful.

688
00:56:46,535 --> 00:56:52,596
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think more workshops would be nice, more open mics would be nice and things like that.

689
00:56:52,796 --> 00:56:53,236
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, thanks.

690
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:53,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Fantastic.

691
00:56:53,976 --> 00:56:54,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

692
00:56:54,517 --> 00:56:54,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

693
00:56:55,257 --> 00:57:02,698
[SPEAKER_06]: So our sister city, Malden, what excites you most about Malden's future as a great place for poetry?

694
00:57:03,436 --> 00:57:11,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Malden, there are so many people in Malden who really care about the city and who invest their time.

695
00:57:11,941 --> 00:57:20,265
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many projects going on and I feel very grateful, very fortunate that they've included me before the Poet Laureateship.

696
00:57:20,365 --> 00:57:23,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt very included and they welcome the voices.

697
00:57:25,528 --> 00:57:33,474
[SPEAKER_04]: and there's, there's a real, there's a real friendliness about the town, and I haven't found the friendliness to be in every town.

698
00:57:33,654 --> 00:57:40,219
[SPEAKER_04]: When I, when I first moved here, I thought it was, was rather rough, and I was in a different area of town.

699
00:57:40,259 --> 00:57:43,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I've lived in several areas, but Malden, it really has a soul.

700
00:57:43,722 --> 00:57:45,003
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really got things going.

701
00:57:45,103 --> 00:57:45,423
[SPEAKER_04]: We have

702
00:57:45,783 --> 00:57:50,947
[SPEAKER_04]: We had MATV, now we have Urban Media Arts, and it's really a pulse of the town.

703
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:52,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So, come on over.

704
00:57:52,768 --> 00:57:54,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna come over here, y'all come over there.

705
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:55,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

706
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:55,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

707
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:57,011
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you.

708
00:57:57,892 --> 00:57:58,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, thank you.

709
00:57:59,473 --> 00:58:00,894
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, very good.

710
00:58:02,383 --> 00:58:03,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Vijaya Sundaram, C.D.

711
00:58:03,964 --> 00:58:04,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Collins.

712
00:58:06,627 --> 00:58:15,575
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have thoroughly enjoyed hosting this conversation about your work in our, as I call them, sister cities.

713
00:58:16,055 --> 00:58:23,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the future for poetry indeed is bright and exciting in Middlesex County, hired by the Mystic River.

714
00:58:23,562 --> 00:58:29,285
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to thank you for spending a little of your Friday night me time with the city of Medford.

715
00:58:29,685 --> 00:58:33,147
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a great pleasure sharing this community space with you.

716
00:58:33,247 --> 00:58:42,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Please keep on doing all the little things you're doing to stay engaged and bless the neighborhoods that you become such a vital part of.

717
00:58:43,012 --> 00:58:50,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that your time, your talent, and your treasure is highly admired, if by nobody else, certainly by me.

718
00:58:51,727 --> 00:58:56,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And to everyone watching, thank you so much for your attentiveness and your interest in our discussion.

719
00:58:57,491 --> 00:59:03,395
[SPEAKER_06]: So get ready for something a little bit different, but a little bit similar on the musical side of the coin.

720
00:59:03,675 --> 00:59:08,318
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna take a break for some special announcements and to reset the room.

721
00:59:08,458 --> 00:59:09,659
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've got a few minutes.

722
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:15,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I know both Vijaya and CD both have books over at that small table over there.

723
00:59:15,763 --> 00:59:17,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got some stuff over there too.

724
00:59:17,484 --> 00:59:21,427
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're interested, now's the chance to talk to them about their

725
00:59:21,888 --> 00:59:24,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Product okay, okay, all right.

726
00:59:24,415 --> 00:59:24,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

727
00:59:24,956 --> 00:59:26,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you hallelujah

728
01:04:23,271 --> 01:04:24,312
I think I'm okay.

729
01:04:52,988 --> 01:04:53,090
you

730
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:16,672
[SPEAKER_08]: actually, well, I was going to say maybe I can move my speaker back so that I can hear it a little bit better.

731
01:05:16,692 --> 01:05:17,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Not great.

732
01:05:17,173 --> 01:05:19,594
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to turn it towards me a little bit.

733
01:05:29,998 --> 01:05:34,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Or actually, you know, what if we lie it down and then it can... Oh, that's true, you can kind of wedge it up.

734
01:05:34,661 --> 01:05:37,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's already wedge-shaped for a reason.

735
01:05:37,382 --> 01:05:37,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that?

736
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:41,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's better for me.

737
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:42,144
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a lot better.

738
01:05:42,164 --> 01:05:42,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that good?

739
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:43,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, cool.

740
01:05:43,605 --> 01:05:44,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that okay with the mic?

741
01:06:10,763 --> 01:06:12,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Mic check, one, two.

742
01:06:12,564 --> 01:06:13,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Can this?

743
01:06:13,165 --> 01:06:16,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the vocals come over the piano?

744
01:06:16,987 --> 01:06:17,807
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like they do.

745
01:06:17,827 --> 01:06:17,988
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

746
01:06:18,048 --> 01:06:18,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, OK.

747
01:06:18,428 --> 01:06:20,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I turn down a little bit?

748
01:06:20,729 --> 01:06:21,210
Or don't?

749
01:06:23,751 --> 01:06:23,951
OK.

750
01:06:23,971 --> 01:06:28,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure that you can hear yourself.

751
01:06:28,894 --> 01:06:29,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, I can hear myself fine.

752
01:06:32,096 --> 01:06:34,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just don't want to overpower him.

753
01:06:34,097 --> 01:06:37,279
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're going to keep going for a minute?

754
01:07:00,632 --> 01:07:00,974
It's okay.

755
01:07:05,782 --> 01:07:14,727
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I almost have everything in the order that you want to.

756
01:07:15,767 --> 01:07:21,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and if something comes up that you never heard of, I'm just gonna do that.

757
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:22,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what I figured.

758
01:07:22,311 --> 01:07:24,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I don't know nothing about that.

759
01:07:37,063 --> 01:07:37,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

760
01:07:52,348 --> 01:07:53,708
[SPEAKER_06]: All right ladies and gentlemen.

761
01:08:17,044 --> 01:08:23,029
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's been a busy time for us here at the West Medford Community Center.

762
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:34,871
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a bunch of stuff coming up that I do want to make note of.

763
01:08:37,491 --> 01:08:58,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Tentatively, on April 27th, we will be hosting here the West Memphis Community Center's annual legislative breakfast forum, where we will have elected officials from across the city, some of our state representatives as well, that will be here in a moderated forum.

764
01:09:00,456 --> 01:09:01,837
[SPEAKER_06]: available and open to the public.

765
01:09:02,497 --> 01:09:18,228
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also will be having our annual fundraiser, it's called Hoops and Hope, and that takes place between here and Duggar Park across the way and in

766
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:31,416
[SPEAKER_06]: conjunction with the Beck family, a basketball tournament, clinics, and a bunch of other stuff is held across the way.

767
01:09:31,476 --> 01:09:34,457
[SPEAKER_06]: There are food trucks, there's music, lots of excitement.

768
01:09:35,618 --> 01:09:41,201
[SPEAKER_06]: We usually have professional athletes that come as well to help the kids with basketball drills and such.

769
01:09:41,521 --> 01:09:45,944
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really a good time, and so that is set for June 9th.

770
01:09:47,264 --> 01:09:48,505
[SPEAKER_06]: and goes from 11 a.m.

771
01:09:48,745 --> 01:09:50,066
[SPEAKER_06]: in the morning to 6 p.m.

772
01:09:50,226 --> 01:09:56,431
[SPEAKER_06]: in the evening, so we hope you'll come down and check out Hoops and Hope.

773
01:09:57,912 --> 01:10:15,704
[SPEAKER_06]: We're also, again, working on, and you've heard some about this, but you'll hear more over the next several weeks, about the Black Veterans Project, which we've gotten a rather insizable grant from Mass Humanities,

774
01:10:16,244 --> 01:10:23,073
[SPEAKER_06]: So I personally will be looking for conversation and volunteers to help with some tasks.

775
01:10:23,133 --> 01:10:27,920
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're interested in that project, please get in touch with me.

776
01:10:30,521 --> 01:10:39,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, in terms of the West Medford Community Center itself, we're a true non-profit.

777
01:10:40,484 --> 01:10:57,128
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't get a whole lot of big grant funding from, I was thinking about all of the money that, is it Mrs. Bezos, the former Mrs. Bezos has given away?

778
01:10:57,955 --> 01:11:01,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, she's giving millions of dollars to a whole lot of places, right?

779
01:11:01,697 --> 01:11:11,283
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you know her, and you can give her a call and say, we could use a little bit of that lodges down here in the West Memphis community, that would be really, really wonderful.

780
01:11:11,403 --> 01:11:15,886
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you don't know her, but you know somebody who does know her, you can do it that way too.

781
01:11:16,466 --> 01:11:35,523
[SPEAKER_06]: In any case, if you want to donate to the West Memphis Community Center, if you want to become a member, you can always get in touch with us, Lisa Crossman, our executive director, at 781-483-3042 for more information about donating to the community center or membership.

782
01:11:36,684 --> 01:11:48,008
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're gonna turn now, we're gonna pivot a little bit to, I always like to call it the lyrical miracle we've engaged for this evening's musical side of The Ledger.

783
01:11:48,788 --> 01:11:53,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I have to admit, this has been one of my favorite things in the last few years.

784
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:57,991
[SPEAKER_06]: So this man right here, Jonathan Fagan, okay?

785
01:12:00,723 --> 01:12:12,858
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a local pianist, he's a piano teacher, he's got serious musical credentials, and significant experience writing, composing, and erasing jazz and other forms of music.

786
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:16,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he can play anything, play the phone book and make it sound really, really good.

787
01:12:17,665 --> 01:12:27,335
[SPEAKER_06]: We got together in 2020, a few months prior to his launching and convening the first Medford Jazz Festival, which is now in its fourth year?

788
01:12:27,855 --> 01:12:28,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Fourth, yeah.

789
01:12:28,897 --> 01:12:39,808
[SPEAKER_06]: So, long story short, he wrote some music with the intention of exploring themes of social justice and equity, and he asked me, after hearing some stuff that I had done, can't remember what it was,

790
01:12:40,969 --> 01:12:45,412
[SPEAKER_06]: if I'd be interested in adding poetic expression to his melodies.

791
01:12:46,193 --> 01:12:49,976
[SPEAKER_06]: And people believe me, when I tell you, I was all over that.

792
01:12:50,677 --> 01:12:59,264
[SPEAKER_06]: So since that time, we've been blending jazz and poetry in a number of different venues under the umbrella of our Ally Project.

793
01:12:59,824 --> 01:13:01,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we are allies.

794
01:13:01,666 --> 01:13:11,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Ordinarily, we'd be with John Dalton on drums and Greg Toro on the stand-up bass, but they have other assignments this evening.

795
01:13:11,519 --> 01:13:16,426
[SPEAKER_06]: So as Bill Withers used to croon back in the day, it's just the two of us.

796
01:13:17,987 --> 01:13:22,870
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the first day of National Poetry Month, no April fools, no tricks, just treats.

797
01:13:23,851 --> 01:13:24,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

798
01:13:25,111 --> 01:13:31,875
[SPEAKER_06]: The Ally Project featuring Jonathan Fagan on keys, on me, Terry C. on the verbal vocals.

799
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:38,899
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to start out with a tune poem called Hard by the Mystic.

800
01:13:44,212 --> 01:13:50,036
[SPEAKER_06]: They gave my people the lowlands, and not much of it, just a few streets hard by the river.

801
01:13:51,077 --> 01:13:54,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Banks turned a blind eye behind the red lines, and it wasn't about the money.

802
01:13:56,081 --> 01:13:58,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Class was an irresistible force.

803
01:13:58,822 --> 01:14:00,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Race was a movable object.

804
01:14:01,636 --> 01:14:17,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps it wasn't a written rule, but white folks knew the legal to to keep us in our place in this mystic valley space where slaves and rum and ships had built some mansions, made some millionaires, and hid some old money.

805
01:14:18,379 --> 01:14:20,320
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was hard by the mystic we went.

806
01:14:21,001 --> 01:14:22,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Muddy and a bit turned down.

807
01:14:23,302 --> 01:14:27,685
[SPEAKER_06]: The only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town.

808
01:14:28,505 --> 01:14:29,566
[SPEAKER_06]: But we named it.

809
01:14:30,186 --> 01:14:31,047
[SPEAKER_06]: We claimed it.

810
01:14:31,587 --> 01:14:32,948
[SPEAKER_06]: We made it our own.

811
01:14:34,729 --> 01:14:42,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Even in the heat of summer when the shores were parched and the soil was rank with the decay of aquatic alchemy, we were one with the river.

812
01:14:43,094 --> 01:14:46,096
[SPEAKER_06]: We followed its flow to the lakes and the sandy beach front.

813
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:52,299
[SPEAKER_06]: On our own Jordan shore, we baptized and blessed our brothers and sisters in Christ.

814
01:14:52,600 --> 01:15:01,785
[SPEAKER_06]: We caught the little fishes to go with our loaves of bread and became the teeming multitude who our Lord Jesus fed, hired by the mystic.

815
01:15:05,027 --> 01:15:06,308
[SPEAKER_06]: We became community.

816
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:08,369
[SPEAKER_06]: We commanded unity.

817
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:13,513
[SPEAKER_06]: We embraced the village and raised up our children in the way they should go.

818
01:15:28,181 --> 01:15:33,283
[SPEAKER_06]: As the river ebbs and flows, the tides will turn and our fortune grows.

819
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:35,723
[SPEAKER_06]: A few more streets become our home.

820
01:15:36,283 --> 01:15:39,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Houses on Sharon join Kin on Jerome.

821
01:15:39,864 --> 01:15:45,246
[SPEAKER_06]: From Duggar Park to the railroad tracks, the white folks make more room for blacks.

822
01:15:45,786 --> 01:15:47,707
[SPEAKER_06]: The color line recedes a bit.

823
01:15:48,207 --> 01:15:50,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Church and school and center fit.

824
01:15:50,988 --> 01:15:55,109
[SPEAKER_06]: The ville becomes the heart of it, hard by the mystic shore.

825
01:16:06,095 --> 01:16:12,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the worm has surely turned, and folks who left have surely learned things couldn't stay the same.

826
01:16:13,739 --> 01:16:16,300
[SPEAKER_06]: That muddy mystic most days is clean.

827
01:16:16,861 --> 01:16:19,002
[SPEAKER_06]: The banks are freshly cut and green.

828
01:16:19,722 --> 01:16:24,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Faces once distinctly brown are not the only ones in town.

829
01:16:26,158 --> 01:16:41,033
[SPEAKER_06]: These streets that once were our confines must now embrace what gentry defines, condominium culture, bedroom convenience, university sprawl, access, egress, invest, and dispossess.

830
01:16:49,358 --> 01:16:52,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Now those lowlands have become the highlights of a trending city.

831
01:16:53,384 --> 01:17:00,094
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes success isn't pretty when it's at the expense of your black and brown and tan friends.

832
01:17:06,326 --> 01:17:12,489
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet, the river still turns and bends from where it begins to where it ends.

833
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:26,336
[SPEAKER_06]: The only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town, where we named it and claimed it and made it our own.

834
01:17:30,999 --> 01:17:31,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

835
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:33,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

836
01:17:35,239 --> 01:18:00,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so that's the beginning of the story, but the story continues, and it continues as the neighborhood has evolved, and the evolution is stark and pretty dramatic, and we have kind of quantified it with a piece called Gentrified.

837
01:18:20,104 --> 01:18:23,728
[SPEAKER_06]: They talk about renovating, reimagining, and rehabilitating.

838
01:18:24,389 --> 01:18:28,234
[SPEAKER_06]: They rave about new visions, new horizons, and new perspectives.

839
01:18:28,835 --> 01:18:32,579
[SPEAKER_06]: They revel in bistros, boutiques, and boulangeries.

840
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:35,492
[SPEAKER_06]: They fairly skip to the subway stations.

841
01:18:35,552 --> 01:18:37,234
[SPEAKER_06]: They bike on the painted pathways.

842
01:18:37,294 --> 01:18:39,756
[SPEAKER_06]: They Uber and Lyft religiously.

843
01:18:39,896 --> 01:18:43,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's on trend and on point and au pair.

844
01:18:45,521 --> 01:18:55,070
[SPEAKER_06]: They've codified the way they speak about what used to be urban blight, eyesores, drug dens, crack houses, tenements, and slums, the ghetto.

845
01:18:56,155 --> 01:18:59,116
[SPEAKER_06]: They've modified the way they speak about what we now see.

846
01:18:59,676 --> 01:19:06,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Makeovers, investment properties, B&Bs, brownstones, townhouses, condos, and co-ops.

847
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:16,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's vintage, bohemian, artsy, and retro, with creative green spaces and lofted open places.

848
01:19:19,235 --> 01:19:32,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Speculators bought lower than low, patiently waiting for the change, waiting for the junkies to move on, waiting for the squatters to give up, waiting for the black and brown and tan to fade.

849
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:36,688
[SPEAKER_06]: They waited for the graffiti to erode.

850
01:19:37,249 --> 01:19:39,390
[SPEAKER_06]: They waited for the chain link to corrode.

851
01:19:39,911 --> 01:19:41,992
[SPEAKER_06]: They waited for the families to implode.

852
01:19:42,032 --> 01:19:44,414
[SPEAKER_06]: They waited for the prices to explode.

853
01:19:46,256 --> 01:19:47,877
[SPEAKER_06]: They waited as they calculated.

854
01:19:48,922 --> 01:19:50,702
[SPEAKER_06]: They waited as folks capitulated.

855
01:19:51,363 --> 01:19:53,083
[SPEAKER_06]: They waited as folks migrated.

856
01:19:53,783 --> 01:19:56,124
[SPEAKER_06]: They waited as folks evacuated.

857
01:19:57,724 --> 01:20:01,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the realtors came and dispelled white folks' fears.

858
01:20:01,885 --> 01:20:03,966
[SPEAKER_06]: The architects came and re-engineered.

859
01:20:04,026 --> 01:20:06,406
[SPEAKER_06]: The designers came and changed the veneers.

860
01:20:06,466 --> 01:20:09,927
[SPEAKER_06]: The builders came and the new folk cheered.

861
01:20:11,733 --> 01:20:33,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they've moved closer to work in the city, to quartz countertops that made kitchens pretty, to charter schools, nannies, and drivers, and bike frames made with carbon fibers, to Starbucks lattes, artisanal breads, and articulated sleep number beds, to million dollar urban show places, and fewer and fewer black and brown faces.

862
01:20:40,578 --> 01:20:46,621
[SPEAKER_06]: They showed us their heels when they took the white flight, then they crept back in in the dead of night.

863
01:20:47,021 --> 01:20:50,143
[SPEAKER_06]: With fat bank accounts, they were IPO wealthy.

864
01:20:50,223 --> 01:20:53,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Their move to displace was measured and stealthy.

865
01:20:54,305 --> 01:20:57,326
[SPEAKER_06]: All the potholes smoothly paved over.

866
01:20:57,647 --> 01:21:00,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Brown folks got schooled like a curry crossover.

867
01:21:00,508 --> 01:21:06,251
[SPEAKER_06]: White folks doing a long-term sleepover, exclusive, obtrusive, extreme home makeover.

868
01:21:06,991 --> 01:21:09,873
[SPEAKER_06]: With a spoonful of sugar, they took all the clover.

869
01:21:11,232 --> 01:21:15,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Changing the context of neighborhood with subway tile and exotic wood.

870
01:21:15,856 --> 01:21:21,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Harlem, Detroit, and Chicago's south side, Boston's south end surely gentrified.

871
01:21:22,901 --> 01:21:27,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Emptied the church, emptied the steeple, now it's a spot for the chai drinking people.

872
01:21:28,526 --> 01:21:33,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Took down the poles and the basketball hoops, now it's a park for the dog walking troops.

873
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:39,415
[SPEAKER_06]: No more rec and community center, but a new parking lot for the monthly renter.

874
01:21:40,959 --> 01:21:43,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Some folks hank on, but the die is cast.

875
01:21:44,305 --> 01:21:46,509
[SPEAKER_06]: The fire consumes and the torch is passed.

876
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:52,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Invisible lines are drawn again and the banks can't buy when the banks won't lend.

877
01:21:55,131 --> 01:22:00,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Some folks keep their roots in the ground, but the waiting game is deep and profound.

878
01:22:01,318 --> 01:22:04,982
[SPEAKER_06]: They tour the streets noting history, yet what they want is no mystery.

879
01:22:05,602 --> 01:22:15,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Harlem, Detroit, and Chicago's South Side, a reoccupation is being applied to model cities that trickle down, no longer suited to black and brown.

880
01:22:16,909 --> 01:22:26,885
[SPEAKER_06]: The urban sprawl that used to be the only homes we got to see is now the place for a growing infusion, is now the space that the gentry is choosing.

881
01:22:34,952 --> 01:22:50,773
[SPEAKER_06]: low-rise projects slowly yield to equity building leases sealed to folks who came from far afield who won the fight when the poor folk appealed to lawyers and doctors and high-tech heroes with trust fund ones and hedge fund zeros.

882
01:22:52,122 --> 01:23:01,350
[SPEAKER_06]: no preserving community, no real thought of legacy, a small plaque here, a street sign there, nothing that bronzes the atmosphere.

883
01:23:02,331 --> 01:23:07,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Oakland, Brooklyn, and New Orleans, all made targets by whites with means.

884
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:13,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Even in venerable Chocolate City, the news in the district inspires some pity.

885
01:23:15,273 --> 01:23:19,476
[SPEAKER_06]: killing the concept of neighborhood in ways they never understood.

886
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:31,184
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we witness the slow, painful slide as the village we built becomes gentrified.

887
01:23:46,295 --> 01:24:09,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Neighborhood is a lovely thing and one of the things that we wanted to do with the Ally Project is we wanted to, while we were trying to tell the truth about some of the things that we're seeing with regard to social justice and equity and change, we wanted to make sure that we were

888
01:24:10,618 --> 01:24:20,665
[SPEAKER_06]: saying some of the things that were lovely and beautiful and desirable about the neighborhoods that we have enjoyed.

889
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:26,468
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm hoping I can find this piece of poetry to share with you because it does just that.

890
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:29,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I?

891
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:30,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I can't find it.

892
01:24:30,771 --> 01:24:31,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it?

893
01:24:38,979 --> 01:24:39,439
[SPEAKER_06]: She's right.

894
01:24:39,539 --> 01:24:41,480
[SPEAKER_06]: It's right here, and I just can't see it.

895
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,961
[SPEAKER_06]: It's right here, and I just can't see it.

896
01:24:42,981 --> 01:24:44,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

897
01:24:44,321 --> 01:24:44,701
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

898
01:24:46,262 --> 01:24:46,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

899
01:24:47,042 --> 01:24:48,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's fine.

900
01:24:48,403 --> 01:24:48,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

901
01:24:49,923 --> 01:24:50,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll figure it out.

902
01:24:50,984 --> 01:24:54,505
[SPEAKER_08]: You just have to tap it to turn the page.

903
01:24:54,525 --> 01:24:54,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

904
01:24:54,645 --> 01:24:56,726
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay.

905
01:24:56,766 --> 01:24:57,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

906
01:24:57,607 --> 01:25:00,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

907
01:25:00,348 --> 01:25:00,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

908
01:25:03,229 --> 01:25:03,509
[SPEAKER_06]: So I,

909
01:25:06,798 --> 01:25:14,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I did a program out in, it's not Wayland.

910
01:25:16,687 --> 01:25:18,248
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's something like that.

911
01:25:20,030 --> 01:25:22,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was Ashland, not too long ago.

912
01:25:22,772 --> 01:25:25,855
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was for elementary schoolers.

913
01:25:26,635 --> 01:25:31,440
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanted to make sure that I had poems that would resonate with elementary schoolers.

914
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:38,244
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I took a bunch of stuff, because I've written stuff for the kids upstairs.

915
01:25:38,284 --> 01:25:47,730
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a resident preschool called General Dragon, so I wrote a piece for the kids upstairs, and I've written, you know, a bunch of stuff for little kids.

916
01:25:48,131 --> 01:25:56,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try and do a children's book at some point in time, but I've got to find an artist that, you know, that where our styles blend.

917
01:25:56,872 --> 01:26:02,355
[SPEAKER_06]: But in any case, growing up in this neighborhood was a really, really rich experience.

918
01:26:02,435 --> 01:26:05,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I was talking with CD about it earlier.

919
01:26:05,717 --> 01:26:16,524
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lovely nuclear neighborhood where all of the people that you see on that top row, it's called the West Medford Elder Photo Project.

920
01:26:16,544 --> 01:26:20,306
[SPEAKER_06]: 17 and 16 are my aunt and uncle, Bill and Rachel Tanner.

921
01:26:20,806 --> 01:26:25,509
[SPEAKER_06]: And number four, as you come in the doors, my father, God rest his gentle soul, Vonnie Cotter,

922
01:26:26,338 --> 01:26:30,183
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I had, let's see, there's 28 pictures.

923
01:26:30,403 --> 01:26:31,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I had 28 parents.

924
01:26:32,786 --> 01:26:34,729
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a conservative estimate.

925
01:26:37,521 --> 01:26:39,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody knew you.

926
01:26:39,882 --> 01:26:55,955
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you got into any, what they referred to as devilishness or devilishment, the last thing you wanted to have happen was to have a call go to, you know, at that time I think the number was 483, you know, whatever it was, right?

927
01:26:55,975 --> 01:26:56,576
[SPEAKER_06]: It was 48 something.

928
01:26:57,996 --> 01:27:04,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Because then, and I came from the generation where corporal punishment was not frowned upon.

929
01:27:05,399 --> 01:27:07,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I came from the switch and belt generation.

930
01:27:08,601 --> 01:27:10,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Cut my own switches, and C.D.

931
01:27:10,382 --> 01:27:12,563
[SPEAKER_05]: and I have this in common.

932
01:27:12,603 --> 01:27:14,423
[SPEAKER_05]: She's from Kentucky, so go figure.

933
01:27:14,904 --> 01:27:15,564
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways,

934
01:27:17,355 --> 01:27:25,626
[SPEAKER_06]: The last thing you wanted to have happen to you was your parents get called, you go home, you've already gotten a tum lashing in the street, then you get the real lashing when you get home.

935
01:27:26,067 --> 01:27:31,774
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you get the, just wait until your father gets home, nothing but dread.

936
01:27:32,795 --> 01:27:33,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolute dread.

937
01:27:33,716 --> 01:27:36,637
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, we had some favorite places.

938
01:27:36,917 --> 01:27:45,541
[SPEAKER_06]: The West Memphis Community Center, an old Quonset hut that was toted up here from Charlestown and built on the site was the first community center.

939
01:27:45,561 --> 01:27:47,861
[SPEAKER_06]: This lovely building is the second community center.

940
01:27:48,962 --> 01:27:50,583
[SPEAKER_06]: But this was our second home.

941
01:27:50,803 --> 01:27:52,183
[SPEAKER_06]: We spent a lot of time here.

942
01:27:52,764 --> 01:28:00,947
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the other institutions for children, okay, aside from the church where our parents raised us, was called The Little Store.

943
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:06,289
[SPEAKER_06]: You about to get it all.

944
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:07,494
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

945
01:28:07,715 --> 01:28:08,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm coming.

946
01:28:08,698 --> 01:28:09,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm coming.

947
01:28:09,481 --> 01:28:09,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

948
01:28:13,283 --> 01:28:18,444
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a tiny red hovel on Upper Jerome, a bit run down and rough around the edges.

949
01:28:19,264 --> 01:28:27,626
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mr. Henry seemed so old to us, even then, with a lot of whiskers, impatient and a little scary.

950
01:28:28,706 --> 01:28:38,728
[SPEAKER_06]: One would suspect that he didn't even like kids, but he really must have loved us, or else where did all that penny candy come from?

951
01:28:40,168 --> 01:28:42,148
[SPEAKER_06]: He had all of it, no seriously.

952
01:28:43,009 --> 01:28:48,890
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd bust in there with a few nickels or a handful of pennies, all loud and unruly.

953
01:28:50,951 --> 01:28:54,231
[SPEAKER_06]: He'd hush us up while he finished with grown folks' business.

954
01:28:55,512 --> 01:28:59,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Then he'd be back, like a black Willy Wonka up in that old shack.

955
01:28:59,913 --> 01:29:05,034
[SPEAKER_06]: He'd peer over those old horn-rimmed glasses and tell us, he didn't have all day.

956
01:29:05,814 --> 01:29:09,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Then he'd blow open one of those small brown craft paper bags,

957
01:29:10,891 --> 01:29:15,802
[SPEAKER_06]: and get to stuffin' while we were ooin' and ironin', huffin' and puffin'.

958
01:29:16,667 --> 01:29:23,472
[SPEAKER_06]: See, Mr. Henry had all the treats, all of our favorites, a hundred great sweets.

959
01:29:24,733 --> 01:29:33,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Root beer barrels and pixie sticks, squirrel nut zippers and banana splits, green mint juleps and button strips, red licorice ropes and bottle nips.

960
01:29:34,101 --> 01:29:44,509
[SPEAKER_06]: He had bazooka Joe bubble gum and a tiny sucker called a dum-dum, jawbreakers and Tootsie Rolls, sugary love for little kids' souls.

961
01:29:45,109 --> 01:29:49,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Candy necklaces to wear and bite and waxy red lips were such a sight.

962
01:29:50,372 --> 01:29:55,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Fat gum cigars and kids cigarettes right beside the crunchy six lets.

963
01:29:56,056 --> 01:30:00,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Mary Jane chewies and BB bats, hot fireballs and Mexican hats.

964
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:03,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the genuine Hersey's kisses.

965
01:30:04,221 --> 01:30:06,502
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the hits and none of the misses.

966
01:30:07,102 --> 01:30:09,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Kit, taffy squares and Necco wafers.

967
01:30:10,424 --> 01:30:12,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Liquor made and Boston baked beans.

968
01:30:13,106 --> 01:30:14,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Gold rocks.

969
01:30:15,336 --> 01:30:21,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Nuggets of gum in a bag, a kid's idea of sweet to swag.

970
01:30:23,678 --> 01:30:29,879
[SPEAKER_06]: From cold January to chilly December, more kinds of candy than I can remember.

971
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:36,241
[SPEAKER_06]: At the Ville storefront on Upper Jerome, I knew I had to write this poem.

972
01:30:36,961 --> 01:30:44,583
[SPEAKER_06]: See, Mr. Henry had all the treats, all of our favorites, a hundred great sweets.

973
01:30:50,063 --> 01:30:50,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.

974
01:30:51,584 --> 01:30:52,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

975
01:30:52,785 --> 01:30:53,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

976
01:30:53,185 --> 01:30:53,365
[SPEAKER_05]: See?

977
01:30:54,606 --> 01:30:54,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

978
01:30:56,448 --> 01:30:58,669
[SPEAKER_05]: See, Janelle, you think back and remember, don't you?

979
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:00,010
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

980
01:31:00,131 --> 01:31:00,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that's right.

981
01:31:00,991 --> 01:31:01,972
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that's right.

982
01:31:02,172 --> 01:31:02,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

983
01:31:02,652 --> 01:31:03,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, see, now.

984
01:31:09,851 --> 01:31:19,756
[SPEAKER_06]: You probably were here more so when Frank Hedden owned the store, because he basically got it after Mr. Henry kind of went by the wayside.

985
01:31:20,256 --> 01:31:23,657
[SPEAKER_06]: But he called it Hedden's Variety, but it was the same store.

986
01:31:24,778 --> 01:31:25,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

987
01:31:25,998 --> 01:31:27,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you might, you might.

988
01:31:28,259 --> 01:31:30,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Hedden's Variety, yeah.

989
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:32,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go get it right now.

990
01:31:33,621 --> 01:31:37,043
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in my, I got a bowl in my office.

991
01:31:38,024 --> 01:31:40,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do, I meant to bring it out, I forgot.

992
01:31:41,207 --> 01:31:46,973
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we finish, I'm gonna bring the bowl of candy out and you can get some tootsie rolls, all right?

993
01:31:48,034 --> 01:32:00,586
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so we're gonna play, it's kind of the title cut from our album project, our CD project, which is called The Ally Project.

994
01:32:00,986 --> 01:32:02,468
[SPEAKER_06]: This piece is called The Ally.

995
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:21,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Friends become distant and strange, as if you have some creeping mange.

996
01:32:22,547 --> 01:32:25,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Family wonders why and wrings their hands.

997
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:27,632
[SPEAKER_06]: How could you choose them over us?

998
01:32:27,913 --> 01:32:31,376
[SPEAKER_06]: We're your blood, bone of your bone and flesh of your flesh.

999
01:32:32,477 --> 01:32:33,779
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not like us.

1000
01:32:34,259 --> 01:32:38,184
[SPEAKER_06]: They're so different, less than, not equal to, beneath.

1001
01:32:39,522 --> 01:32:41,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Declarations have been made.

1002
01:32:41,563 --> 01:32:42,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Arrangements are in place.

1003
01:32:43,305 --> 01:32:45,666
[SPEAKER_06]: These are matters of our kin.

1004
01:32:46,647 --> 01:32:47,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Signs have been painted.

1005
01:32:47,868 --> 01:32:49,048
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to be cast out.

1006
01:32:49,609 --> 01:32:50,749
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to be shunned.

1007
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:54,252
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to stick with your own kind.

1008
01:32:57,454 --> 01:32:58,294
[SPEAKER_06]: An ally?

1009
01:32:59,015 --> 01:33:00,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what they're calling you?

1010
01:33:01,377 --> 01:33:03,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's a hard road to hoe.

1011
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,822
[SPEAKER_06]: You're making strange bedfellows.

1012
01:33:05,842 --> 01:33:08,365
[SPEAKER_06]: You're casting your white pearls before swine.

1013
01:33:08,705 --> 01:33:11,288
[SPEAKER_06]: You weren't raised to behave like this.

1014
01:33:12,429 --> 01:33:14,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Our family is a proud and honored clan.

1015
01:33:15,132 --> 01:33:17,535
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll never be lower than any black man.

1016
01:33:18,527 --> 01:33:20,968
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no room for them at the table.

1017
01:33:21,608 --> 01:33:31,393
[SPEAKER_06]: There's always been two sides of the track, a right and a wrong side of town, our kind and their kind, your people and those folk.

1018
01:33:31,733 --> 01:33:35,455
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to kill your mother and your daddy's turning over in his grave.

1019
01:33:36,435 --> 01:33:44,659
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to shout out Black Lives Matter, but the master plan is to make them scatter to serve them pain on a silver platter.

1020
01:33:45,871 --> 01:33:47,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Our people owned them.

1021
01:33:47,713 --> 01:33:50,236
[SPEAKER_06]: They worked this land for 200 years.

1022
01:33:50,296 --> 01:33:51,697
[SPEAKER_06]: They were our property.

1023
01:33:52,458 --> 01:33:55,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Our Negroes, hell, our Negroes to make it plain.

1024
01:33:56,443 --> 01:33:58,625
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't be out there with them.

1025
01:33:59,186 --> 01:34:07,735
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't be shoulder to shoulder with the ones we need to dominate, relegate, subjugate, eliminate.

1026
01:34:10,452 --> 01:34:11,773
[SPEAKER_06]: They want reparations?

1027
01:34:12,634 --> 01:34:17,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're making preparations to give them 40 acres of hell and a mule kick to the gut.

1028
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:20,062
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't seem to get it, son.

1029
01:34:20,582 --> 01:34:22,164
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the way the races run.

1030
01:34:22,184 --> 01:34:24,366
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not enough room for everyone.

1031
01:34:24,386 --> 01:34:28,150
[SPEAKER_06]: The time for black and brown is done.

1032
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:31,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Show your pride and pick up your gun.

1033
01:34:31,873 --> 01:34:34,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Pick the side that has always won.

1034
01:34:35,742 --> 01:34:38,045
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't be out there with them.

1035
01:34:38,606 --> 01:34:47,439
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't be shoulder to shoulder with the ones we need to dominate, relegate, subjugate, eliminate.

1036
01:34:56,494 --> 01:34:58,696
[SPEAKER_06]: My father used to say, life is hard, but fair.

1037
01:34:58,736 --> 01:35:00,818
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a good home, but you didn't stay there.

1038
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:03,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

1039
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:06,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's lighten up the mood a little bit.

1040
01:35:06,863 --> 01:35:08,864
[SPEAKER_06]: This is called Kitchen Table Poem.

1041
01:35:09,145 --> 01:35:11,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And the one thing about this piece is,

1042
01:35:15,425 --> 01:35:20,847
[SPEAKER_06]: One of Sidi's pieces was earlier when she read, it's universal.

1043
01:35:21,747 --> 01:35:25,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if the ingredients aren't the same, everybody's in the kitchen.

1044
01:35:26,969 --> 01:35:28,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so this is that poem.

1045
01:35:33,931 --> 01:35:35,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody ever wants to leave.

1046
01:35:37,287 --> 01:35:43,032
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like the blueberry stains on mama's apron, settled and satisfied.

1047
01:35:43,873 --> 01:35:52,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Good food has been eaten, fresh corn and collard greens, fried chicken and potato salad, bellies are fat and full.

1048
01:35:54,643 --> 01:35:55,824
[SPEAKER_06]: This is that room.

1049
01:35:57,125 --> 01:36:00,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God, and girl, and are you serious right now?

1050
01:36:02,188 --> 01:36:02,968
[SPEAKER_06]: It's real talk.

1051
01:36:03,749 --> 01:36:04,689
[SPEAKER_06]: We're real people.

1052
01:36:05,389 --> 01:36:06,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Family, you know what I'm saying?

1053
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:08,250
[SPEAKER_06]: We're family.

1054
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:11,751
[SPEAKER_06]: You can smell the love long before the door opens.

1055
01:36:11,791 --> 01:36:17,933
[SPEAKER_06]: You know there's gonna be pecan pie and the sweet tea will be ice cold.

1056
01:36:19,113 --> 01:36:21,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Southern folk will slip out of their northerness.

1057
01:36:22,234 --> 01:36:26,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Accents will thicken and a country shade will feel closer to the city sun.

1058
01:36:28,487 --> 01:36:32,610
[SPEAKER_06]: and they'll stay at that table long after the crumbs are cleared.

1059
01:36:32,670 --> 01:36:34,551
[SPEAKER_06]: The dishes will be all washed.

1060
01:36:34,931 --> 01:36:39,114
[SPEAKER_06]: The food will be put away or packed in Tupperware and Ziploc bags.

1061
01:36:40,135 --> 01:36:43,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone will have a doggie bag and a story to tell.

1062
01:36:45,178 --> 01:36:52,623
[SPEAKER_06]: The men will be playing bitter, slapping down some Donham notes, sipping on a little something and talking big trash.

1063
01:36:53,784 --> 01:36:58,047
[SPEAKER_06]: The smiles will be broad and the laughter will be contagious.

1064
01:36:58,953 --> 01:37:01,535
[SPEAKER_06]: The women will be fanning and fussing.

1065
01:37:02,196 --> 01:37:04,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Good lord, she know she too big for that dress.

1066
01:37:05,438 --> 01:37:07,380
[SPEAKER_06]: That ain't no Sunday saved outfit.

1067
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,562
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for Saturday night sinning.

1068
01:37:10,142 --> 01:37:10,883
[SPEAKER_06]: You know I'm right.

1069
01:37:11,563 --> 01:37:12,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Girl, you know I'm right.

1070
01:37:14,146 --> 01:37:16,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody ever wants to leave.

1071
01:37:17,335 --> 01:37:20,397
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like black Jesus's eyes on that old print.

1072
01:37:21,238 --> 01:37:22,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Loving and insistent.

1073
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:24,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Soul food has been shared.

1074
01:37:25,522 --> 01:37:29,745
[SPEAKER_06]: My gene has prayed down heaven and the babies sang their song.

1075
01:37:30,806 --> 01:37:33,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's tickled and tranquil.

1076
01:37:34,589 --> 01:37:36,370
[SPEAKER_06]: This is that room.

1077
01:37:38,492 --> 01:37:39,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I really miss pap.

1078
01:37:41,074 --> 01:37:42,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Mom's holding her own.

1079
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:44,737
[SPEAKER_06]: And baby boy's cancer's in remission.

1080
01:37:46,058 --> 01:37:50,202
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you coming back to church, it's real talk.

1081
01:37:51,223 --> 01:37:53,705
[SPEAKER_06]: We're real people, family.

1082
01:37:54,346 --> 01:37:55,326
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?

1083
01:37:55,987 --> 01:37:57,889
[SPEAKER_06]: We're family.

1084
01:38:04,475 --> 01:38:06,476
[SPEAKER_06]: So Jonathan Fagan on the keyboards.

1085
01:38:11,141 --> 01:38:11,301
[SPEAKER_06]: So

1086
01:38:13,411 --> 01:38:29,860
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to deviate from the program just a bit because I think one of the things we wanted to do is we wanted to feature as many cuts as we could from the CD so that perhaps you'll be of a mind to pick up a copy.

1087
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:33,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Beyond that, I mean, we poets, and C.D.

1088
01:38:33,743 --> 01:38:36,745
[SPEAKER_06]: knows it, and Vijaya certainly knows it, we just keep on writing, you know?

1089
01:38:37,285 --> 01:38:41,809
[SPEAKER_06]: We write a book, and, you know, the book is the book, and, you know, we're off to the next thing.

1090
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:42,990
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we're writing.

1091
01:38:43,491 --> 01:38:50,576
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wrote this piece, and Jonathan and I haven't had a chance to talk about it or play together or anything, but I really want to share it with you tonight.

1092
01:38:51,037 --> 01:38:54,340
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Place, Race, and Remembrance, okay?

1093
01:38:56,341 --> 01:38:59,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Lamenting the loss of my touchstones and my high altars,

1094
01:39:00,356 --> 01:39:06,203
[SPEAKER_06]: The grade school where I learned to read and write as a condo for the first wave of bedroom community occupants.

1095
01:39:06,924 --> 01:39:11,609
[SPEAKER_06]: A co-op for the early adopters of IPO dividends and biotech windfalls.

1096
01:39:12,611 --> 01:39:15,954
[SPEAKER_06]: The place where I first heard of JFK's assassination.

1097
01:39:17,056 --> 01:39:20,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody was crying, and we didn't even understand why.

1098
01:39:21,328 --> 01:39:22,388
[SPEAKER_06]: We understand now.

1099
01:39:23,229 --> 01:39:26,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Martin and Medgar and Malcolm gave us the lesson.

1100
01:39:27,511 --> 01:39:28,731
[SPEAKER_06]: But did it really take?

1101
01:39:30,012 --> 01:39:32,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Old Henry's Little Store has been gone for 50 years.

1102
01:39:33,053 --> 01:39:35,674
[SPEAKER_06]: All the penny candy is in trendy boutiques now.

1103
01:39:36,315 --> 01:39:41,717
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sold by the pound these days and dispensed from plexiglass tubes.

1104
01:39:42,097 --> 01:39:47,920
[SPEAKER_06]: High-end jelly beans come in 100 flavors, weird flavors like popcorn and Pepsi Cola.

1105
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Cost a whole lot more than any penny, a whole lot more.

1106
01:39:53,246 --> 01:39:56,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember needing to be off the street before the street lights came on.

1107
01:39:57,269 --> 01:40:04,513
[SPEAKER_06]: We were all still doing fake karate, acting like Bruce Lee, and playing run the bases near the corner of Houghton and Monument Streets.

1108
01:40:05,294 --> 01:40:07,935
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to keep an eye out for the Braxton dogs.

1109
01:40:08,516 --> 01:40:14,039
[SPEAKER_06]: There weren't any Pitbulls or Wartwilers yet, but Butch was pretty ornery and he liked to bite folks.

1110
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:20,283
[SPEAKER_06]: If you'd done something cool or been at all remarkable, you had a nickname.

1111
01:40:21,004 --> 01:40:25,670
[SPEAKER_06]: The roll call is still pretty long, but the absent far outweigh the present.

1112
01:40:26,491 --> 01:40:27,973
[SPEAKER_06]: We knew all of these cats.

1113
01:40:28,737 --> 01:40:58,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Fruitman, Spud, Wood, Hollywood, Smidlap, Walk, Hive, Craze, Lace, Jordash, JC, Tip, Baff, Puddin', TC, Top Cat, Junior, Lenz, Brax, Spizz, Sparrow, Wiz, Zoom, Burton, J, Willie, Wit, Walt, Fives, Wolf, Wolfie, Gogg, Sputnik, Oak, Coke, Coco, Rog, Flash, Ice, Doc, Von Eric, Gib, Bullet, Jed, Jab, Butchy, Buddy, Spanky, Ike, AD, Nelly, Wing, Monk, Snake, Lammy, Richie Rich, Hulk, Stutzy, Foot, Humpty, Rock,

1114
01:40:59,077 --> 01:41:01,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Mervy, Turtle, Zeke, Puka, B.A.

1115
01:41:01,859 --> 01:41:15,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Farm, Abu, Bruno, Bunky, Squirrel, Stoney, Barron, Skipper, Putney, Sonny, Old Henry, the General, Chinky, Stoney, Kainsey, O.G., Earl, Java, Little Charlie, Rabbit, Scooch, Turtle, and Creek.

1116
01:41:16,408 --> 01:41:18,849
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just the brothers.

1117
01:41:19,690 --> 01:41:20,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the brothers.

1118
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:24,844
[SPEAKER_06]: The place where we wed is a different kind of sanctuary now.

1119
01:41:26,126 --> 01:41:29,931
[SPEAKER_06]: The pools have become padded settees in a glitz and glass lobby.

1120
01:41:30,872 --> 01:41:34,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Sacred vows have been replaced by lawyers' lease agreements and HOA fees.

1121
01:41:35,558 --> 01:41:39,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Realtors and developers ran off the pastors, deacons, and elders.

1122
01:41:40,049 --> 01:41:42,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Bought off the next generation and the next and the next.

1123
01:41:43,335 --> 01:41:45,199
[SPEAKER_06]: The choir loft is a coffee counter.

1124
01:41:45,239 --> 01:41:46,782
[SPEAKER_06]: The parish is a dog park.

1125
01:41:46,842 --> 01:41:48,765
[SPEAKER_06]: The temple is a bohemian tea house.

1126
01:41:49,327 --> 01:41:51,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Dim sum through the front door, tapas through the back.

1127
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:59,286
[SPEAKER_06]: My touchstones and my high altars are little more than fond memories and sad truths of loss and surrender.

1128
01:42:00,066 --> 01:42:03,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Occasional reunions call out to the scattered and departed.

1129
01:42:03,469 --> 01:42:12,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Homegoing celebrations gather the long gone and the still standing for lamentations, testimonies, collard greens, and fried chicken communions.

1130
01:42:13,478 --> 01:42:16,519
[SPEAKER_06]: We won't have this place for too much longer.

1131
01:42:17,559 --> 01:42:24,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Place, race, and remembrance are more for picture books and archives than safe harbor and inheritance.

1132
01:42:24,802 --> 01:42:37,946
[SPEAKER_06]: The cats with all those nicknames will surely become footnotes in a set of encyclopedias that has become every bit as obsolete in this brave new world of Siri, AI, Google, and Amazon.

1133
01:42:38,999 --> 01:42:42,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Song poets sang, time rewriting every line.

1134
01:42:43,287 --> 01:42:44,870
[SPEAKER_06]: My lyric is not a rewrite.

1135
01:42:45,391 --> 01:42:48,176
[SPEAKER_06]: We may not have a chance to do it all again.

1136
01:42:49,008 --> 01:43:02,701
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is just me waiting for the last move on the Ville's chessboard, waiting for the brothers to play that last game at the park Colonel Duggar built or the courts Cleedy Rome built.

1137
01:43:03,422 --> 01:43:14,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I am lamenting the loss of my touchstones and my high altars, lamenting the loss of my memories of the village, memories of the Ville.

1138
01:43:37,028 --> 01:43:44,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Jonathan and I, I say it all the time, Jonathan and I met at the intersection or confluence of jazz and social justice.

1139
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:55,270
[SPEAKER_06]: But we make sure that we do as much jazz as possible because jazz is very cool, jazz is very cool.

1140
01:43:56,452 --> 01:44:11,062
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're gonna do a piece that is a kind of a paean to a jazz piece that was done by, I'm sure Herbie Hancock did it, I know Quincy Jones did it, and that piece was called, Tell Me a Bedtime Story.

1141
01:44:11,522 --> 01:44:14,564
[SPEAKER_06]: So this piece is called, Tell Me Another Bedtime Story.

1142
01:44:51,752 --> 01:44:57,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this where the Sandman picks up each grain, restoring the beauty, reducing the pain?

1143
01:44:58,277 --> 01:45:03,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this where we fly to Never Never Land like a troop of lost boys with Peter Pan?

1144
01:45:05,022 --> 01:45:09,526
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the mystery of hidden dreams, nothing now is as it seems.

1145
01:45:09,866 --> 01:45:16,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell a sweet tale that sugars and creams with flashes of stardust and shining moonbeams.

1146
01:45:17,779 --> 01:45:22,526
[SPEAKER_06]: As I lay down to my slumber, paint a landscape of ochre and umber.

1147
01:45:23,047 --> 01:45:25,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Let there be a hint of romance.

1148
01:45:26,151 --> 01:45:27,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn up the quiet.

1149
01:45:27,693 --> 01:45:29,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Love wants to dance.

1150
01:45:57,458 --> 01:46:14,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me a bedtime story, please, of secret gardens and pecan trees, of babbling brooks and waterfalls, of gentle breezes that summer calls, of hidden hadens and wondrous spaces, of astral planes and mystical places.

1151
01:46:18,390 --> 01:46:22,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Let there be a melody that sings in four-part harmony.

1152
01:46:23,172 --> 01:46:28,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Let it resound in symphony, then fold into dreamland's reverie.

1153
01:46:29,575 --> 01:46:41,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me a fable of Arabian nights, spread on a table of earthly delights, free from the labels of anger and fights, willing and able to scale higher heights.

1154
01:46:50,191 --> 01:47:12,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me a bedtime story now, as the baby rocks in the maple bough, as the blue ox puts his nose to the plow, as the sweaty farmer wipes his brow, as each green seedling happily vows to yield each fruit that the ground allows, and seven dwarves whistle a happy tune, and sleeping beauty awakens soon.

1155
01:47:17,085 --> 01:47:21,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Let there be a melody that sings in four-part harmony.

1156
01:47:22,374 --> 01:47:28,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Let it resound in symphony, then fold into dreamland's reverie.

1157
01:47:40,359 --> 01:47:52,887
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the time when the sandman whispers, and seven grooms meet seven sisters, and the prairie sings an ode to love as angels release the turtle dove.

1158
01:47:53,668 --> 01:48:01,213
[SPEAKER_06]: For now, I lay me down to sleep and pray to God my soul to keep.

1159
01:48:05,276 --> 01:48:05,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1160
01:48:06,431 --> 01:48:06,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1161
01:48:08,032 --> 01:48:11,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Jonathan, faking on the keys.

1162
01:48:12,956 --> 01:48:14,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Truly, truly wonderful.

1163
01:48:15,899 --> 01:48:17,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Truly, truly, truly wonderful.

1164
01:48:21,723 --> 01:48:22,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

1165
01:48:23,484 --> 01:48:24,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you got skills.

1166
01:48:24,986 --> 01:48:25,426
[SPEAKER_06]: No doubt.

1167
01:48:27,608 --> 01:48:27,728
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1168
01:48:31,238 --> 01:48:43,904
[SPEAKER_06]: If you listen to the news, sometimes you do, sometimes you don't, we're in a crisis, you know, with our immigrant situation.

1169
01:48:45,685 --> 01:48:46,486
[SPEAKER_06]: But unless you

1170
01:48:48,849 --> 01:48:56,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheyenne, Cherokee, Shoshone, Arapaho, Iroquois, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1171
01:48:57,898 --> 01:48:58,859
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all immigrants.

1172
01:48:59,359 --> 01:49:01,101
[SPEAKER_05]: We all came here from someplace else.

1173
01:49:01,161 --> 01:49:03,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I know my people came here from someplace else.

1174
01:49:04,224 --> 01:49:05,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to say anything more about that.

1175
01:49:07,367 --> 01:49:17,953
[SPEAKER_06]: But that does not preclude our ability to have the wonder and the splendor of this country resonate with us in very real ways.

1176
01:49:18,614 --> 01:49:20,315
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is called Beloved Country.

1177
01:49:47,179 --> 01:49:48,541
[SPEAKER_06]: I can love this country, too.

1178
01:49:49,722 --> 01:49:52,224
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have to be born on these barney shores.

1179
01:49:52,725 --> 01:49:56,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have to be a son of the Pentacook, Quinnipiac, or Mohican.

1180
01:49:56,829 --> 01:50:01,394
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have to have a pilgrim pedigree or be a Connecticut Yankee from King Arthur's Court.

1181
01:50:02,134 --> 01:50:07,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I can be the Dahomian, the Pole, or the child of Caribbean suns and Amazon shades.

1182
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:10,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I can love this country too.

1183
01:50:10,622 --> 01:50:14,806
[SPEAKER_06]: My green card was a welcome ticket to a new life in a new land.

1184
01:50:15,187 --> 01:50:18,129
[SPEAKER_06]: My passport was stamped with new hopes and new dreams.

1185
01:50:18,510 --> 01:50:23,995
[SPEAKER_06]: My suitcases were packed full with new aspirations and some apprehensions too.

1186
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:33,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps I didn't see the harbor sign that said, give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuge of your teeming shore.

1187
01:50:34,048 --> 01:50:36,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me.

1188
01:50:37,331 --> 01:50:39,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I lift my lamp beside the golden door.

1189
01:50:40,754 --> 01:50:48,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps I didn't see the lady in the lamp, but I did see the gleaming city on a hill that couldn't be hid, and my soul responded.

1190
01:50:49,561 --> 01:50:51,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I can love this country too.

1191
01:50:52,017 --> 01:50:55,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I can love its rolling meadows and its gospel songs.

1192
01:50:55,521 --> 01:50:59,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I can love its asphalt highways and its born-to-run boss.

1193
01:50:59,925 --> 01:51:03,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I can love its teeming ghetto and its urban sprawl.

1194
01:51:03,849 --> 01:51:09,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I can love its old spires, new minarets, and golden menorahs.

1195
01:51:26,781 --> 01:51:28,622
[SPEAKER_06]: But can America love me too?

1196
01:51:29,742 --> 01:51:32,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Can she love my hijab and henna tattoos?

1197
01:51:33,644 --> 01:51:36,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Can she love my Hajj, my Mecca, my Medina?

1198
01:51:37,485 --> 01:51:40,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Can she love my Cinco de Mayo and Dia de los Muertos?

1199
01:51:41,447 --> 01:51:44,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Can she love my kente cloth, dreads, twists, and locks?

1200
01:51:45,309 --> 01:51:52,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Can she love the skin I'm in, be it ebony, ivory, dulce de leche, or cafe au lait?

1201
01:51:53,872 --> 01:51:55,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Can she love me by name?

1202
01:51:56,275 --> 01:52:06,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Shekinah Glory, Muhammad bin Said, Anastasia Khozov, Cleophis Dorcio, Claudia Gonzalez, can she love me by name?

1203
01:52:07,964 --> 01:52:16,251
[SPEAKER_06]: And what if I am among those huddled masses in their wretched refuge or that homeless tempest-tossed?

1204
01:52:16,631 --> 01:52:18,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Will she continue to lift her lamp?

1205
01:52:20,314 --> 01:52:22,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do war and rumors of war,

1206
01:52:23,055 --> 01:52:35,827
[SPEAKER_06]: IEDs, sleeper cells, and faith distortions make me a pariah to be eliminated, a scourge to be annihilated, and a plague to be exterminated.

1207
01:52:39,390 --> 01:52:40,251
[SPEAKER_06]: I come in peace.

1208
01:52:44,995 --> 01:52:46,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I love this country, too.

1209
01:52:47,176 --> 01:52:48,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I love its boundless opportunity.

1210
01:52:48,897 --> 01:52:50,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I love its generosity of spirit.

1211
01:52:51,298 --> 01:52:53,640
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the audacity of its hope.

1212
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:56,561
[SPEAKER_06]: I love its rolling meadows and its joyful songs.

1213
01:52:57,022 --> 01:53:00,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I love its asphalt highways and its little red Corvette.

1214
01:53:01,424 --> 01:53:03,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I love its teeming ghetto and its urban sprawl.

1215
01:53:03,905 --> 01:53:08,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I love its old spires, new minarets, and golden menorahs.

1216
01:53:13,118 --> 01:53:16,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I come in peace, and I love America, too.

1217
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:23,903
[SPEAKER_06]: I come in peace, and I love America, too.

1218
01:53:31,526 --> 01:53:31,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1219
01:53:32,286 --> 01:53:32,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1220
01:53:32,687 --> 01:53:33,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

1221
01:53:33,367 --> 01:53:34,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

1222
01:53:35,228 --> 01:53:35,548
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1223
01:53:38,553 --> 01:53:40,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we're going to do one piece, one more piece.

1224
01:53:40,854 --> 01:53:42,075
[SPEAKER_06]: We got time for one more piece.

1225
01:53:44,396 --> 01:53:46,117
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do another jazz piece.

1226
01:53:46,157 --> 01:53:47,597
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to end with a jazz piece.

1227
01:53:53,081 --> 01:54:02,747
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're into jazz, and perhaps even if you're not, the jazz canon is really full of signature songs.

1228
01:54:03,968 --> 01:54:10,852
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Miles Davis, Blue Miles, and there's John Coltrane, Naima, and there's...

1229
01:54:12,233 --> 01:54:15,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Thelonious Monk, Epistrophe.

1230
01:54:15,855 --> 01:54:17,676
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many of them.

1231
01:54:18,116 --> 01:54:29,962
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my favorites is a track that was made famous pretty much by, it wasn't by him originally, but it was made famous by Ahmed Jamal and it's called Poenciana.

1232
01:54:30,522 --> 01:54:33,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, really beautiful, beautiful piano piece.

1233
01:54:34,704 --> 01:54:43,546
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a riff on that, it's called Reprise for Poinciana, and I think it's one of our favorite things to play together, so.

1234
01:54:53,028 --> 01:54:59,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect a fantasy in black and tan, between a Savoy ballroom and a Paris can-can.

1235
01:55:01,553 --> 01:55:03,674
[SPEAKER_06]: The kind of blue that doesn't get you down.

1236
01:55:03,754 --> 01:55:07,535
[SPEAKER_06]: It rather has you twirling round and round and round.

1237
01:55:07,855 --> 01:55:10,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of blue, but not really.

1238
01:55:11,416 --> 01:55:19,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a conversation between Miles and Q in a smoke-filled corner, just those two, talking about the music round midnight.

1239
01:55:20,379 --> 01:55:28,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Miles in that miraculous horn, all gravel-voiced and full of scorn, asking Q, what made you feel like doing stuff like that?

1240
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:34,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Jazz finds justice in the majesty of the blues.

1241
01:55:35,052 --> 01:55:38,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Take five to wonder and you'll know that this is true.

1242
01:55:39,234 --> 01:55:45,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Deep and delicious all over, pondered passionately in pianissimo, keeping standard time.

1243
01:55:48,191 --> 01:56:05,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Duke's Mood Indigo, Joe Sample's Rainbow Seeker, Errol Garner's Misty, Worshipping in Harmony, you know the melody, songs you just can't get out of your head, kind of blue, but not really.

1244
01:56:08,044 --> 01:56:19,934
[SPEAKER_06]: just like the woman whose name you call as the autumn leaves begin to fall, or maybe like the melody by Ahmad Jamal, Potency Ana.

1245
01:56:22,677 --> 01:56:28,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Last days of sun and sand and sea, you and your love and the music made three.

1246
01:56:29,381 --> 01:56:43,583
[SPEAKER_06]: A lyric so familiar, a song so sweet, ebony notes on an ivory sheet, new tear stains on every page, a bit of your heart in a crystal cage, kind of blue, but not really.

1247
01:56:45,478 --> 01:56:47,721
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll remember her most round midnight.

1248
01:56:48,742 --> 01:56:55,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Poinciana, fragrant, fresh wind recollections, a song reprised.

1249
01:56:56,172 --> 01:57:02,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Summer breeze makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.

1250
01:57:03,163 --> 01:57:09,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Miles and Q in that smoke-filled corner, talking about taking the A train, going up to Smalls Paradise.

1251
01:57:09,667 --> 01:57:13,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Sassy's going to be scatting, and Hawk's band is in town doing jazz.

1252
01:57:13,769 --> 01:57:22,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Some real justice, marvelous, majestic, and kind of blue, but not really.

1253
01:57:23,875 --> 01:57:26,416
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll remember her most around midnight.

1254
01:57:27,077 --> 01:57:31,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Poinciana, pungent, rose-petaled pictures.

1255
01:57:33,982 --> 01:57:34,983
[SPEAKER_06]: A song reprise.

1256
01:57:35,883 --> 01:57:43,108
[SPEAKER_06]: The first time ever I saw your face, I thought the sun rose in your eyes.

1257
01:57:45,249 --> 01:57:47,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Fantasy perfected in cocoa and cream.

1258
01:57:47,830 --> 01:57:50,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Harlem nights in a Moulin Rouge daydream.

1259
01:57:50,232 --> 01:57:57,596
[SPEAKER_06]: The kind of blue that fills your soul and gulps your spirit and makes you whole.

1260
01:57:58,797 --> 01:58:01,198
[SPEAKER_06]: My Poinciana.

1261
01:58:02,811 --> 01:58:12,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll remember you most round midnight, frail fragments of love's fulfillment, kind of blue, but not really.

1262
01:58:14,494 --> 01:58:17,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Your song reprised.

1263
01:58:17,935 --> 01:58:22,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Till you come back to me, that's all I'm going to do.

1264
01:58:23,637 --> 01:58:27,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Poinciana, my poency.

1265
01:58:32,887 --> 01:58:33,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Jonathan Fagan.

1266
01:58:33,868 --> 01:58:36,812
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm Terry Cotter.

1267
01:58:41,598 --> 01:58:42,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

1268
01:58:44,562 --> 01:58:45,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

1269
01:58:49,922 --> 01:58:53,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, there's some of our CDs over there, the Ally Project.

1270
01:58:53,645 --> 01:59:02,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a few books, an anthology that I'm in with 21 other American poet laureates of African-American descent.

1271
01:59:03,254 --> 01:59:05,135
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the first time one's ever been done.

1272
01:59:06,997 --> 01:59:10,278
[SPEAKER_06]: And then my fifth and sixth book are over there as well.
