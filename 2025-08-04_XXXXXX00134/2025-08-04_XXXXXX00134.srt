[SPEAKER_00]: And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:22,598 --> 00:00:29,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:33,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:35,885
[SPEAKER_03]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:40,962
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thank you both for meeting with me this afternoon.

10
00:00:40,982 --> 00:00:45,093
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could just start out by introducing yourself, so your name pronouns and who you are.

11
00:00:48,677 --> 00:00:49,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, I'll go first.

12
00:00:49,718 --> 00:00:54,980
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am Micah Shalom Kesselman is usually how I go about go by when I'm talking about this particular topic.

13
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:56,661
[SPEAKER_04]: My pronouns are he, him.

14
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:58,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been a Medford resident for a good bit.

15
00:00:58,863 --> 00:01:03,445
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am here with sort of representing Medford for Palestine, actually.

16
00:01:03,825 --> 00:01:04,906
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Josh Eckert-Lee.

17
00:01:05,626 --> 00:01:06,907
[SPEAKER_01]: I use he, him pronouns.

18
00:01:07,227 --> 00:01:09,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived in Medford for just over a year now.

19
00:01:09,949 --> 00:01:16,092
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm an organizer in part with Medford for Palestine, but also involved with other relevant groups across the city.

20
00:01:17,774 --> 00:01:18,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

21
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:20,176
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we're just going to get right into it.

22
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:26,540
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I know you both are here to talk a little bit about the ordinance in front of the city council.

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,123
[SPEAKER_03]: That's called Medford values aligned local investment ordinance.

24
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:38,108
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about maybe a little bit about Medford for Palestine, but then also kind of what you want us to know about all the work that you're doing.

25
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:41,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

26
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:41,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

27
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:42,051
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

28
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:55,148
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've been working on for the last few months has been working to make sure that our tax dollars as Medford residents aren't going to harmful industries.

29
00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:06,515
[SPEAKER_01]: While we organize as a group for Medford for Palestine, we bring a multiplicity of perspectives and a recognition of the intersectionality of a lot of these harmful industries.

30
00:02:07,116 --> 00:02:10,478
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's in front of the city council is a proposal to

31
00:02:11,643 --> 00:02:15,846
[SPEAKER_01]: not allow the city to invest in the fossil fuel industry.

32
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:22,411
[SPEAKER_01]: I come from a background as a climate organizer, so this is really important to me and an effort that I know has been long running in the city.

33
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:35,121
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also a lack of investment in a prison industrial complex, in weapons manufacturing, and in companies that are profiting off of a wide range of human rights violations.

34
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:38,724
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the sort of key elements that we're trying to make sure that

35
00:02:39,204 --> 00:02:47,110
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the money that we provide to the city isn't invested in ways that hurt residents in Medford and residents like those of us in Medford.

36
00:02:49,392 --> 00:02:49,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

37
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:56,238
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I may, I just want to sort of like jump in there and add a little additional clarification too.

38
00:02:56,278 --> 00:03:05,107
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, you know, like Josh, I'm also involved in a number of different groups and organizations, both within Medford and elsewhere.

39
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:13,915
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, even though this ordinance is really being spearheaded by Medford for Palestine,

40
00:03:14,668 --> 00:03:24,410
[SPEAKER_04]: It does arise out of the extensive effort of a coalition of different groups and demographics within Medford as well.

41
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:37,492
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to make sure to mention that because I know that will get brought up and that has tripped up some people in the past that we've talked to, but this really is sort of a coalition effort, not just a coalition effort.

42
00:03:37,532 --> 00:03:39,452
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Medford coalition effort.

43
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:42,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

44
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, you know, I'm wondering, I know that this is something that is the city council is working on as well.

45
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:55,058
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder what you want us to know about that sort of what support you've gotten around this.

46
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:56,339
[SPEAKER_03]: What resistance you've gotten.

47
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:56,539
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I.

48
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:06,500
[SPEAKER_04]: So this ordinance entered drafting, I think, Josh, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think 2024 actually.

49
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,883
[SPEAKER_04]: It started really last year.

50
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:14,411
[SPEAKER_04]: At the beginning of the year, I think Zach picked it up, Zach Bares picked it up to really

51
00:04:15,112 --> 00:04:21,333
[SPEAKER_04]: put a lot of effort and focus on it in, you know, collaboration with us.

52
00:04:22,434 --> 00:04:36,497
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been going through review and iterations and drafts and redrafts and discussions for, you know, it went through months and months of that up to the City Council meeting back in June.

53
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:42,378
[SPEAKER_04]: And even since then has been going through its own sort of, you know, back and forth conversation and talking about it.

54
00:04:43,095 --> 00:05:07,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and this is part of a long history of work, you know, Medford, you know, environmental organizers and Medford folks who care about, you know, the way our money is spent have been working for like a well over a decade on trying to recapture some of these, you know, investments in ways that align with our values and align with the sort of thriving future that we all want to see.

55
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:22,011
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is very much a continuation of those efforts and an expansion from, you know, what we see already passed in Boston, which was a fossil fuel divestment ordinance, and expands it to recognize that interconnection between these various harmful industries.

56
00:05:25,334 --> 00:05:30,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe just want to like drive the point home, like, how is this important to Medford for Palestine?

57
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:35,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

58
00:05:36,163 --> 00:06:03,648
[SPEAKER_01]: So Medford for Palestine is a group of Medford residents, some of whom are Palestinian, who are organizing consistently to try and provide direct aid to families and friends in Gaza and in Palestine, as well as to bring greater awareness to our neighbors and friends about the critical nature of the genocide that's happening, the active and critical levels of starvation that have been really amplified in the last few weeks.

59
00:06:04,428 --> 00:06:19,746
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that awareness is a recognition of part of the complicity that we as generally American citizens and particularly as Medford residents have in propping up some of the destruction that happens in Palestine.

60
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:25,352
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that is through investment of tax dollars into industries that are profiting off of that.

61
00:06:26,008 --> 00:06:39,771
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we see in the city's public budget is there's a $12 million portfolio that's invested in Lockheed Martin and Chevron, world's largest weapons manufacturer, world's largest fossil fuel emitter.

62
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:50,573
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something that is taking your tax dollars as a Metro resident and putting them towards the creation of bombs and the destruction of our livable planet.

63
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:55,376
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Medford residents do care, should care where their money goes.

64
00:06:55,977 --> 00:06:59,279
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw that with the Invest in Medford campaign last fall.

65
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:09,347
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is another chance to reclaim those tax dollars and spend them more responsibly, more reasonably, and more justly.

66
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:29,968
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way the ordinance is drafted and what it's aiming for, it absolutely, and of course, is targeting the ongoing genocide and apartheid happening in occupied Palestine.

67
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:39,433
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it is broad because this is a value that a lot, like I want to say this is a value.

68
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:43,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the idea that genocide is bad and

69
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:48,033
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, murder is a bad thing, and apartheid is bad.

70
00:07:48,273 --> 00:07:49,454
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the value that I'm talking about.

71
00:07:49,494 --> 00:07:58,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we can all agree, no matter where you are on this ordinance, that, you know, those of us who live in the city of Medford agree that that's at least not a good thing that we should be facilitating in any way.

72
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:02,041
[SPEAKER_04]: And in any way we can stop facilitating it, we want to do that.

73
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:11,627
[SPEAKER_04]: But sort of back to my starting point, the phrasing of it captures more than just what's happening in Palestine.

74
00:08:13,915 --> 00:08:22,986
[SPEAKER_04]: does go after any human rights abusers, anyone engaged in, there's a long list of examples

75
00:08:24,106 --> 00:08:47,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's non-exhaustive, but the one that has put it into the amended ordinance is that, you know, killings, physical abuse, displacement, or other rights violations, confinement, forced labor, human rights violations based on racial, gender, or LGBTQ plus identity, war crimes, crimes against humanity, apartheid, genocide, ethnic cleansing, illegal occupation, and complicity with such actions by governments or other parties.

76
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:58,718
[SPEAKER_04]: So it isn't just Palestine, though that is unquestionably the biggest example of it in...

77
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,956
[SPEAKER_04]: right now and really in living memory, I would say.

78
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:16,542
[SPEAKER_04]: But you do, I mean, this would bring into review relationships with other countries like, you know, Myanmar had a genocide, still has it, arguably.

79
00:09:17,903 --> 00:09:26,168
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on in Yemen and the complicity of Saudi Arabia in Yemeni genocide

80
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:29,250
[SPEAKER_04]: also falls directly within the scope of this.

81
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Sudan falls within the scope of this.

82
00:09:31,932 --> 00:09:35,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Increasingly, what's going on in India falls within the scope of this.

83
00:09:35,995 --> 00:09:44,000
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not just about so-called, and I just use this phrasing because I know that this is what we have run into and this is what we're going to see.

84
00:09:44,301 --> 00:09:53,047
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't just about Israel and Israel's actions, not picking on Israel, but it is absolutely trying to decouple any

85
00:09:54,028 --> 00:10:03,055
[SPEAKER_04]: support that we are giving these horrific, egregious actions that are being done by state actors and companies that are facilitating it as much as possible.

86
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:06,317
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just so happens that right now, I would say Israel is getting special protection.

87
00:10:07,518 --> 00:10:07,718
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

88
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:21,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and so the question that I've heard, you know, posed to like city councilors is, you know, and I think to me, it's like sort of clear in how you're saying this, but why is this something that

89
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:27,104
[SPEAKER_03]: A city council should be involved in, like, why, why is this a, why is this an issue for local government?

90
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:38,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I can take the 1st bite of this 1. so, yeah, this is something that I've spoken to a couple of times in past council meetings to.

91
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:53,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Fundamentally, at the very base of it, all politics is local, especially in a nation and city where we come from all over the globe, have family members everywhere.

92
00:10:54,091 --> 00:11:02,574
[SPEAKER_04]: There is not, unless there's a large cohort of, you know, original Missittook

93
00:11:03,434 --> 00:11:12,439
[SPEAKER_04]: people's living in Medford, which maybe there are, I don't know, but the overwhelming majority of us in Medford come from, you know, somewhere else in our history.

94
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:18,102
[SPEAKER_04]: But beyond that, our values apply globally.

95
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:22,305
[SPEAKER_04]: We live in a global world, we live in a global economy, we live in a global society.

96
00:11:22,905 --> 00:11:31,270
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, anything we do, even at the local level, that has global repercussions, global impacts, you know, we should

97
00:11:32,203 --> 00:11:38,989
[SPEAKER_04]: It is my opinion that we should do what we can to make those impacts match what our values are.

98
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:49,137
[SPEAKER_04]: We wouldn't be okay with the city of Everett engaging in a genocide.

99
00:11:49,853 --> 00:11:50,153
[SPEAKER_04]: right?

100
00:11:50,414 --> 00:11:58,941
[SPEAKER_04]: And we would probably say, hey, we don't want any company supporting Everett engaging in a genocide to be getting any of our tax dollar investment.

101
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:07,328
[SPEAKER_04]: So why is it any different if it's, you know, instead of Everett, it's Israel or anywhere else?

102
00:12:08,088 --> 00:12:11,431
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're all part of our common shared humanity.

103
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,780
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not picking on Everett.

104
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Everett's a lovely place.

105
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:16,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Everett is a lovely place.

106
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:21,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't mean to get them catching strays, but it's not just like a platitude that we are all like citizens of the world.

107
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:36,350
[SPEAKER_01]: By the very nature of our current investments that city council has a jurisdiction over, we are currently investing Medford tax dollars into these global businesses causing global harms, right?

108
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:50,600
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not this ordinance is seen as the right path for folks, city council already has a complicit stake in the fiduciary responsibility of the city and its tax dollars.

109
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,586
[SPEAKER_01]: So this isn't us dragging the city into a global issue.

110
00:12:56,647 --> 00:12:59,770
[SPEAKER_01]: The city by nature of its global investments is already there.

111
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:12,894
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we are like responding to that reality with a similar, you know, very realistic and hopefully responsible approach that recognizes that and tries to steer our tax dollars to things that matter.

112
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:24,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to make one more addition to that is, you know, this is like a pet peeve of mine, too, because we've gotten this question a lot and it drives me kind of crazy.

113
00:13:24,878 --> 00:13:28,319
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a lot of opinions, but I'll keep it to this one last one.

114
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:36,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Josh said, our finances are invested globally to one degree or another.

115
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,975
[SPEAKER_04]: They have an international impact and footprint.

116
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:43,498
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they are an expression of our sort of international reach as much as that is.

117
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:52,544
[SPEAKER_04]: If there are others in the city who agree that this isn't enough, great, mazel tov, we agree.

118
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:54,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to do more.

119
00:13:56,375 --> 00:14:00,617
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, help sponsor an ordinance to send a flotilla to Palestine.

120
00:14:00,877 --> 00:14:01,677
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be dope.

121
00:14:01,837 --> 00:14:02,838
[SPEAKER_04]: We would be in support of that.

122
00:14:02,938 --> 00:14:04,679
[SPEAKER_04]: There is absolutely more we can do.

123
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:13,583
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we can't do is nothing, because doing nothing would be an awful crime and unconscionable.

124
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:19,986
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is at least the little something we can do with the little amount of power that we are given in our local governance.

125
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:27,124
[SPEAKER_03]: So for folks who are just like sort of making this connection by listening to this, like, how can they be involved?

126
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:28,184
[SPEAKER_03]: How can they express support?

127
00:14:28,204 --> 00:14:30,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

128
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:48,254
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they are interested specifically in like realigning the, you know, city's investments with their like values of shared humanity and sustainability, and hopefully like being anti-weapons as so many of us are, they can show up and support this ordinance.

129
00:14:48,494 --> 00:14:50,915
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being heard on Tuesday, August 5th.

130
00:14:51,603 --> 00:14:58,591
[SPEAKER_01]: at the city council, that will be its official first reading, where there will be plenty of opportunities for public comment.

131
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:09,943
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that'll be a great space for anyone who cares about any of these specific industries, you know I serve the city as a volunteer on the Medford Energy and Environment Committee.

132
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:25,431
[SPEAKER_01]: that committee, you know, is guided by the city's Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, which really highlights the linkages between our financial systems and our natural environment and the way that those financial systems have destroyed that environment.

133
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:33,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are a lot of environmental activists and people who just care about sustainability who have already come out and shown support for an ordinance like this.

134
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,777
[SPEAKER_01]: So if, you know, you think

135
00:15:36,798 --> 00:15:51,449
[SPEAKER_01]: as you generally, that the issue of human rights and genocide feels too thorny and too complex, but you are seeing, you know, the really real and on the ground impact that we're seeing by climate destruction.

136
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,572
[SPEAKER_01]: I would support this because it divests us from fossil fuels.

137
00:15:54,672 --> 00:15:59,536
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're seeing the impact of, you know, ice raids in Medford, right?

138
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:04,540
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw those Domino's delivery guys get taken just blocks from my house on Main Street, like,

139
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,531
[SPEAKER_01]: That is propping up the private prison industry.

140
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:19,075
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think that's shitty and we shouldn't be supporting that industry, you should come out and vote and speak your mind positively about this ordinance because we want to divest from prisons.

141
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:30,339
[SPEAKER_01]: If you or someone you love has been a victim of gun violence, I don't know anyone who I grew up with who hasn't personally been affected by that because that's such a critical and unresolved issue in this country.

142
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:40,006
[SPEAKER_01]: the opportunities to reclaim our small bit of responsibility in trying to shift towards a more sustainable world.

143
00:16:42,488 --> 00:16:42,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

144
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:44,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'm wondering if there's anything else.

145
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:51,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've talked about sort of the content of the ordinance that the meeting is happening on Tuesday to discuss this.

146
00:16:51,752 --> 00:16:53,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else that you want people to know about it?

147
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:53,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

148
00:16:58,302 --> 00:17:02,726
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few things that I think that, you know, in the, in the past city council meetings.

149
00:17:03,787 --> 00:17:13,135
[SPEAKER_04]: A few things have been brought up and some of them actually legitimate concerns and in good faith, which I think it's important that we sort of get a chance to address here.

150
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:14,236
[SPEAKER_04]: The other ones.

151
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:20,816
[SPEAKER_04]: not so much legitimate, not so much in good faith, but I still think we should be sure to address them.

152
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:26,680
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we talked a little bit about how this is coming from within Medford.

153
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,622
[SPEAKER_04]: This arises out of a coalition of residents and groups.

154
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:31,983
[SPEAKER_04]: within the city.

155
00:17:32,543 --> 00:17:48,328
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked a little bit about, you know, how each of the things that are covered in the ordinance, even though they don't directly affect us and we don't directly engage with them, are nevertheless things that we are tacitly supporting by allowing our money to be invested into them.

156
00:17:48,828 --> 00:18:00,271
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, one of the other things I just want to make sure that we do talk about, though, is that from my fiduciary perspective, because this has come up quite a bit with varying degrees of faith, I would say, this

157
00:18:01,898 --> 00:18:13,504
[SPEAKER_04]: The ordinance, the draft on it was is modeled on ordinances, similar ordinances in other cities across the country that have actually gone into effect.

158
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:23,430
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've seen the outcome of having this values aligned restriction on tax money investment.

159
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:30,594
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the end of the day, it doesn't have any real

160
00:18:32,324 --> 00:18:36,747
[SPEAKER_04]: negative impact on the city's portfolios and the portfolio's performance.

161
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:43,793
[SPEAKER_04]: The cities that have put this into effect, Dearborn, Michigan, I think Portland is another one, Portland, Oregon.

162
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:45,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

163
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:59,685
[SPEAKER_04]: And Boston's implementation of the fossil fuels component, either it hasn't been shown to underperform compared to its non-restricted cohort, or in some cases,

164
00:19:00,522 --> 00:19:03,845
[SPEAKER_04]: not the usual, so don't expect it, but in some cases it has outperformed.

165
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:14,012
[SPEAKER_04]: So from a fiduciary duty as regards, you know, performance of our municipal accounts, this is kind of a no-brainer because it's not an issue.

166
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:27,041
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, for those people who are still concerned about it, because I'm sure we will still get these comments in City Council on Tuesday, I invite them to provide

167
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:43,218
[SPEAKER_04]: concrete, discrete data points of where this type of ordinance has resulted in a city being financially harmed in any measurable way.

168
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,861
[SPEAKER_04]: If they can provide that, great.

169
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:47,482
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know what?

170
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:54,497
[SPEAKER_04]: we can go ahead and look at ways to amend to avoid those particular issues.

171
00:19:54,557 --> 00:20:06,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Because keep in mind, when this gets voted in on Tuesday, it is going through multiple readings, and every single reading provides another opportunity to put an amendment.

172
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:09,891
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just how our process works in the city of Bedford.

173
00:20:09,911 --> 00:20:11,112
[SPEAKER_04]: There's three more readings.

174
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:17,593
[SPEAKER_04]: So there will be months of time to discuss and further if you think that's the case.

175
00:20:18,313 --> 00:20:37,036
[SPEAKER_04]: So that sort of gets to another point that I just wanted to make is, again, like if you see issues with it, but you agree with the intent and you agree with the spirit of the ordinance, the multiple reading process is there just for that sort of situation where it can be amended and adjusted and tweaked.

176
00:20:37,677 --> 00:20:39,837
[SPEAKER_04]: So you should

177
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:50,727
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, if you agree with the intent, then you should support its passing and then support amending it so that we can make it as strong as it possibly can be.

178
00:20:51,347 --> 00:21:06,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say that, you know, personally right now, I, I will fully admit, I was very unhappy with some specific Councilors when this was first introduced and they brought a what I at that time would have considered an unnecessary delay.

179
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:08,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Nevertheless, I am

180
00:21:09,637 --> 00:21:31,563
[SPEAKER_04]: very impressed with Zach and my fellows in the Medford for Palestine group that's working on this and how they have used the time to strengthen and really tighten up the ordinance and make it into what I consider to be one of the stronger ordinances I've actually seen presented at city council for a vote.

181
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,304
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's in a really good state right now, but it can still be changed and improved.

182
00:21:34,484 --> 00:21:35,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything can be improved.

183
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:38,765
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it for me.

184
00:21:40,712 --> 00:21:41,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Micah.

185
00:21:41,672 --> 00:21:49,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the message boils down to we are your neighbors trying to do something that feels right and good.

186
00:21:49,894 --> 00:21:54,594
[SPEAKER_01]: We are trying to engage with this in a good faith and well-spirited way.

187
00:21:54,674 --> 00:22:03,056
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would really encourage everyone who has whatever range of views on this issue to do the same.

188
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:08,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone who goes to these city council meetings where thornier geopolitical subjects

189
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:16,730
[SPEAKER_01]: comes up knows to expect it to be a long meeting and often like quite a contentious one and that is like not the intention.

190
00:22:19,053 --> 00:22:24,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Get past and trying to see our city do a pretty small

191
00:22:25,682 --> 00:22:33,286
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty early stage step towards trying to align the way the city acts with the values that we uphold.

192
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:41,991
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a request to engage in this in good faith and with the spirit of collaboratively trying to build a better ordinance.

193
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:46,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what we've been doing in the month since this was first heard at city council.

194
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:51,877
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not necessarily what's been seen by some other folks.

195
00:22:52,197 --> 00:22:53,798
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to emphasize how

196
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:57,267
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, excellent and disciplined.

197
00:22:57,728 --> 00:23:15,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Our city council members have been, even as they've been flooded with thousands of emails from outside groups from across the country, from across the world saying like, no, no, no, this is tantamount to, you know, major anti-Semitism, which, which like, we really don't believe that to be the case.

198
00:23:15,371 --> 00:23:19,011
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we are trying to go and talk to our neighbors.

199
00:23:19,051 --> 00:23:23,652
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been really trying to engage actively and, and with, with intention here.

200
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:31,126
[SPEAKER_01]: and want to make sure that everyone involved is safe and, you know, engaging with this in an open and honest way.

201
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:38,893
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to just circle back to what your mic has said and to kind of explain it maybe a little bit more simply for people.

202
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:49,103
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sounds like you, what you're saying is to divest from these like Chevron Lockheed Martin that are facilitating awfulness all across the world would have

203
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,763
[SPEAKER_03]: No negative impact to the city financially we wouldn't lose money.

204
00:23:54,323 --> 00:24:05,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering what the timing would be so like let's say this ordinance pass like what's the timing of like divesting from these from these certain companies and investing in ones that maybe are more responsible.

205
00:24:09,923 --> 00:24:17,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Assuming that the mayor signs off on it, but even if she doesn't, that just basically means that there's like a 10-day lag on it going into effect.

206
00:24:18,346 --> 00:24:24,829
[SPEAKER_04]: But as soon as it gets entered into the city's laws, it should go into operation.

207
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:33,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually really glad you brought this up because that does segue into another point that I wanted really to make sure that we talked about, and that is

208
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:37,691
[SPEAKER_04]: the feasibility and the practicality of this.

209
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:41,571
[SPEAKER_04]: And that sort of goes hand in hand with the financial impact.

210
00:24:41,591 --> 00:24:48,052
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not going to be a huge deleterious financial impact if any real noticeable impact whatsoever.

211
00:24:48,552 --> 00:24:59,814
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also been this ongoing concern, I'll say, of is our treasurer competent enough to put this ordinance into effect?

212
00:25:00,635 --> 00:25:03,115
[SPEAKER_04]: And the answer is,

213
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Unequivocally, yes.

214
00:25:06,352 --> 00:25:08,233
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very straightforward to put into effect.

215
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:26,185
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, because of that conversation and some follow-up conversations that Zach had with the administration, the current draft of the ordinance includes guidelines and a model to follow.

216
00:25:27,174 --> 00:25:32,858
[SPEAKER_04]: for investing as well that targets the specific issues that we're concerned about.

217
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:42,345
[SPEAKER_04]: And the ordinance also has a way of updating that guidance and guidelines going forward on an annual basis and also within the initial period.

218
00:25:42,926 --> 00:25:48,390
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also did see Josh's comment, and I will quickly correct that, that it will go into effect at the end of the calendar year.

219
00:25:49,493 --> 00:26:05,501
[SPEAKER_01]: is when so the ordinance language as written asks for like a report given to city council 120 days after it passes just to like give a sense of where the treasurer is in her process and the intention set forth in the ordinance is

220
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:11,104
[SPEAKER_01]: for these funds to be divested from these industries and to be following this like sustainable investment guide.

221
00:26:11,564 --> 00:26:16,766
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a nationally known financial sort of sustainable investing model by the end of this year.

222
00:26:16,946 --> 00:26:25,591
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we can really reasonably see a pretty fast turnaround because this is like, this is a financial transaction or like issue.

223
00:26:25,631 --> 00:26:30,193
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, there's not a deep, long, necessary review process.

224
00:26:30,393 --> 00:26:32,094
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's pretty actionable.

225
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:34,675
[SPEAKER_01]: And to highlight Mike's point, like

226
00:26:35,297 --> 00:26:36,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Treasurer is excellent.

227
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:37,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a public employee.

228
00:26:38,018 --> 00:26:40,578
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of the public employees in Medford.

229
00:26:40,818 --> 00:26:44,599
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all trying to do their jobs well, and they're all super competent at them.

230
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:54,802
[SPEAKER_01]: The updates to this ordinance that give that model make their jobs a little bit easier, even as this ordinance adds one additional step to their already pretty intense workload.

231
00:26:55,831 --> 00:27:00,034
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone in all departments is overworked and understaffed.

232
00:27:00,094 --> 00:27:12,743
[SPEAKER_01]: And we recognize that, which is why it's really important to us that we have the data and there is tons and tons of empirical studies showing that sustainable investment is not a financial risk.

233
00:27:13,183 --> 00:27:14,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Portfolios perform

234
00:27:15,532 --> 00:27:17,594
[SPEAKER_01]: just as good as or slightly better.

235
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:33,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, if you take a longer time view, as so many investment firms and insurance firms do, investing in fossil fuels that are actively destroying our communities is not in line with our fiduciary responsibility.

236
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:36,413
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see these longer term investments already

237
00:27:37,457 --> 00:27:40,079
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally divesting themselves from these disruptive industries.

238
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:43,762
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just like being early adopters on that train.

239
00:27:44,182 --> 00:27:54,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm wondering, so for people listening who maybe have their own investments in some of these companies that maybe are doing more harm than good at this point, are there, where, how do we find this guy?

240
00:27:55,031 --> 00:27:57,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, how can you, what can you suggest for like individual investors?

241
00:27:58,575 --> 00:27:59,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

242
00:27:59,315 --> 00:28:00,116
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, that's great.

243
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:00,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

244
00:28:00,456 --> 00:28:02,697
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of us have retirement funds.

245
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:04,978
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us have our own, you know, our stocks.

246
00:28:05,258 --> 00:28:15,163
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use the MSCI ESG fund, which is a lot of letters, but ESG is going to be your key kind of acronym that stands for environmental social governance.

247
00:28:15,803 --> 00:28:19,845
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the kind of social impact type funds that you'll see.

248
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:23,287
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big ones is a Vanguard social index fund.

249
00:28:23,805 --> 00:28:30,962
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that is a large index fund that has been specifically screened to remove these deleterious industries.

250
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:51,609
[SPEAKER_01]: can also, if you're specifically concerned about your investments going and supporting the active genocide, you can go to the American Friends Service Committee and their work specifically targeting and identifying organizations that are profiting off of genocide worldwide, specifically happening in Palestine.

251
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:56,111
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some really useful and very user-friendly tools.

252
00:28:57,832 --> 00:28:58,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

253
00:28:58,199 --> 00:29:11,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and if your retirement savings are invested through like Empower, which I think almost like everyone I know has their... Empower is the manager or whatever it's called.

254
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:18,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not like an investment guy, so I don't know too much about like the specific terminology, but if it's through them, like I do know that they keep

255
00:29:20,203 --> 00:29:25,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Advisors investment advisors on staff specifically to help you navigate this and.

256
00:29:25,726 --> 00:29:30,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that they could help you figure out a specific vehicle that they offer that could let you.

257
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:35,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Do at least what you can to divest where you think it's important to.

258
00:29:37,052 --> 00:29:37,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

259
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:41,194
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all been really helpful information and I don't know how many people.

260
00:29:41,835 --> 00:29:45,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Already knew about this ordinance, so I'm glad to have all this clarification.

261
00:29:45,637 --> 00:29:47,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other things that you want us to know about before we wrap up?

262
00:29:50,247 --> 00:30:08,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think, you know, I do want to make one quick additional point that we sort of lost over, but I do think that, you know, as a Jewish person that's been very involved in this and having seen how this

263
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:28,438
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation around this ordinance has been reframed as this anti-semitism adjacent sort of concern, even though I fundamentally, axiomatically do not think that this in any way is related to anti-semitism.

264
00:30:28,998 --> 00:30:32,680
[SPEAKER_04]: But nevertheless, the reality of the

265
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:40,382
[SPEAKER_04]: discussions around it is that certain groups have have sort of forced it into this conversation.

266
00:30:40,983 --> 00:30:42,664
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do want to make a, you know, a point to that.

267
00:30:42,744 --> 00:30:45,686
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll say that, you know, one again, I am Jewish.

268
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:52,450
[SPEAKER_04]: If you if you couldn't tell by the fact that my first name is Misha Shalom, and my last name is Kesselman, I am very Jewish.

269
00:30:53,035 --> 00:31:06,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been involved in the Jewish community and my family has, to a significant degree, literally my entire life and the lives of my forebears for generations before I moved out here to Boston or Medford.

270
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:14,862
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the first reading, when this first was introduced to city council for a vote,

271
00:31:16,783 --> 00:31:18,664
[SPEAKER_04]: back in June, I entered comments.

272
00:31:19,064 --> 00:31:30,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Some comments I entered on behalf of myself, but I also read in a comment on behalf of the New England chapter of the International Jewish Labor Bund, which fully supports this ordinance.

273
00:31:31,372 --> 00:31:40,417
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only way to, you know, from our perception, and my own perception, and the only way to tie this

274
00:31:43,148 --> 00:32:01,732
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of activity, this idea of divesting from genocidal countries, tie it to a question of antisemitism or concern over antisemitism, is to inextricably link Jewishness to Zionism.

275
00:32:02,612 --> 00:32:03,632
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is dangerous.

276
00:32:04,432 --> 00:32:06,253
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really, really, really dangerous.

277
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:11,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kit's spoken on this more than a few times, too, because they are not the same thing.

278
00:32:12,118 --> 00:32:29,104
[SPEAKER_04]: And by claiming that they are the same thing and engaging in that narrative and developing that narrative, you are in fact engaging in actual antisemitism that puts people's lives in danger, perhaps, because

279
00:32:30,338 --> 00:32:48,087
[SPEAKER_04]: You are normalizing the idea that Jewish people are loyal to Israel first, loyal and unquestioningly loyal to Israel first and foremost before anywhere else, which is crazy and dangerous.

280
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're seeing that even now happening where

281
00:32:53,543 --> 00:33:11,639
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, where national sentiment is finally shifting away from blind subservience to the Israeli government and what's going on in Israel, as it should, because it's terrible what they're doing now, what they have been doing for half a century or more.

282
00:33:14,144 --> 00:33:23,948
[SPEAKER_04]: if all of a sudden, you know, public sentiment shifts away from that, but nevertheless, everyone is now thinking that Zionism and Jewishness are the same thing, where does that put those of us?

283
00:33:24,928 --> 00:33:30,410
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, most Jews are very progressive, except for a large cohort who are progressive except for Palestine.

284
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:34,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Hap is a common term to refer to some of these people.

285
00:33:35,372 --> 00:33:37,513
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, where does that put us, right?

286
00:33:37,773 --> 00:33:41,074
[SPEAKER_04]: If all of a sudden, you know, a bunch of

287
00:33:41,851 --> 00:33:48,556
[SPEAKER_04]: people that are loyal first to a country that we're no longer happy with on the other side of the political issue for a bunch of other things.

288
00:33:49,377 --> 00:33:50,397
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a dangerous spot to be in.

289
00:33:50,778 --> 00:34:02,126
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, aside from the moral imperative of it is my belief that every Jew to honor your the sacrifice and

290
00:34:06,025 --> 00:34:11,568
[SPEAKER_04]: lives of your forebears and to honor our culture and religious values.

291
00:34:12,088 --> 00:34:23,855
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to stand in solidarity with any oppressed people, no matter where they are, especially when those oppressors are claiming to do it in our name.

292
00:34:25,275 --> 00:34:28,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Beyond that imperative,

293
00:34:30,117 --> 00:34:44,500
[SPEAKER_04]: from a purely self-interested perspective, we need to stop having this conversation of linking anti-Zionism to anti-Semitism and making them the same, because it is, from a purely self-interested perspective, very dangerous.

294
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:57,683
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to make sure I talked about that too, because it is something that's been very frustrating to deal with, and it's really hard to get that out in a three-minute or often one-minute time frame at the meeting comment section.

295
00:34:58,801 --> 00:35:00,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.

296
00:35:00,142 --> 00:35:00,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

297
00:35:00,322 --> 00:35:17,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and we see that across the Boston area, like the most ardent and active organizers that we are working with and we're in solidarity with are Jewish Bostonians, Medfordites, who recognize that like this is being done in their name.

298
00:35:18,255 --> 00:35:23,759
[SPEAKER_01]: They're being kind of labeled as this one monolith that people are not.

299
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:26,521
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this is about

300
00:35:28,698 --> 00:35:34,059
[SPEAKER_01]: stripping us away from that kind of dehumanizing language that turns us into one massive people.

301
00:35:34,439 --> 00:35:38,000
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the same theory that we've got here with this ordinance, right?

302
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:51,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've got, you know, these funds that are our Medford tax dollars representing, you know, our investments in the world, going and supporting these industries that I know so many Medfordians like do not support.

303
00:35:52,142 --> 00:35:55,003
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is reclaiming that narrative back for us.

304
00:35:55,343 --> 00:35:57,563
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll also say like practically,

305
00:35:58,747 --> 00:36:09,829
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to learn more about the work we do as local organizers with Medford for Palestine, we're really active on Instagram at Medford for Palestine, but this is also a super interdisciplinary and like intersectional issue.

306
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:24,711
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're interested in, you know, fighting against violence, we are like totally in solidarity with the folks over at Safe Medford who are working and doing work to keep us safe because we know that like it's us as the community to keep ourselves safe.

307
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:27,712
[SPEAKER_01]: They are working, you know, to put certain, you know,

308
00:36:28,332 --> 00:36:31,393
[SPEAKER_01]: barriers and safeguards in place so that we can all thrive and live.

309
00:36:31,633 --> 00:36:51,800
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are concerned about prisons and about the ICE kidnappings that are happening, the Luce Network locally, there's an ICE watch hotline that you can call, you can volunteer and then get verified to be a local neighborhood watch type person looking out very literally to try and protect your neighbors from the scourge on their streets.

310
00:36:52,401 --> 00:36:56,082
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, like me, are a climate activist and environmental organizer,

311
00:36:56,642 --> 00:37:04,684
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many groups doing that work locally 350 mass is working on a statewide like making polluters pay campaign really aligning.

312
00:37:05,248 --> 00:37:14,171
[SPEAKER_01]: know, the big financial impact that Americans have across the globe with these major like climate risks and trying to make us more sustainable.

313
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:22,733
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I want to highlight just how intersectional this specific ordinances and how intersectional the work is because there's so many things one can do to be more involved.

314
00:37:23,293 --> 00:37:29,515
[SPEAKER_01]: And this ordinance tries to capture some of those key, key industries that have these overlapping impacts.

315
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:39,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Medford has some great community groups to work towards all of these things, and thank you for the other resources as well.

316
00:37:39,652 --> 00:37:51,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I think even for people who have no time or energy to dedicate to any of those groups, supporting this ordinance is also a really helpful way to have an impact.

317
00:37:53,630 --> 00:38:17,752
[SPEAKER_04]: supporting and also just being, you know, even just being aware of those other groups and just being a, I can't think of the word, but being an amplifier for their message, even if it's just passively re-skeeting, I believe it's called now for blue sky, I don't know, whatever, but re-blue sky posting, Instagram, liking, I'm not a social media guy, doing all these whatever things, you know, that,

318
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:21,082
[SPEAKER_04]: even just that is super helpful and important.

319
00:38:21,182 --> 00:38:27,046
[SPEAKER_04]: And it takes no more time than for you to hit a little button in between doom scrolling.

320
00:38:29,187 --> 00:38:34,490
[SPEAKER_01]: And we totally recognize the massive pulse on people's time.

321
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:41,133
[SPEAKER_01]: And so part of that is why we've tried to make it really easy for folks to be engaged and supportive of this work.

322
00:38:41,393 --> 00:38:42,334
[SPEAKER_01]: So if folks go to

323
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:45,595
[SPEAKER_01]: tinyurl.com slash invest in Medford.

324
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:57,801
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a whole toolkit that explains, you know, why investing in these industries is bad gives you a call script if you want to call your, you know, local city Councilors or an email template that you can

325
00:38:58,442 --> 00:39:07,588
[SPEAKER_01]: used to get started and put your own story into, but trying to make it as easy and straightforward for folks, because we know this impacts everyone's pockets and everyone's books.

326
00:39:07,788 --> 00:39:12,872
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to, trying to respect their time, respect their agency and give them as many tools as we can.

327
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:15,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you guys.

328
00:39:16,014 --> 00:39:19,596

336

[SPEAKER_04]: If you have criticism, give those comments to a guest, but do it constructively and maybe get a talk with one of us before, and we can maybe figure out, you know, where that comes from, but if you have, but please, yeah.

337
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:44,432
