[SPEAKER_25]: Andre, I haven't had a chance to read those.

21
00:02:44,526 --> 00:02:52,372
[SPEAKER_25]: It looks like they're long and detailed, which is great, but my motion would be to

22
00:02:53,135 --> 00:02:57,117
[SPEAKER_25]: I will wait and vote on accepting them at the next meeting so we have a chance to review them.

[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, David.

44
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:10,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Next item on the agenda is a public hearing on the proposed marijuana ordinance.

45
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:15,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on a moment.

46
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:26,151
[SPEAKER_14]: So public hearing on the proposed amendment to chapter 94, zoning to allow for and regulate adult use marijuana establishments.

47
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:33,457
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to read the public hearing notice now.

48
00:04:35,282 --> 00:04:41,064
[SPEAKER_14]: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on Thursday, July 16, 2020 at 6 p.m.

49
00:04:41,104 --> 00:04:59,732
[SPEAKER_14]: via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to a petition by the Medford City Council to amend chapter 94 zoning revised ordinance of the city of Medford to allow for and regulate adult use marijuana establishments in the city of Medford with an aim to minimize any adverse impacts that marijuana establishments may have on adjacent or nearby properties

50
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:11,594
[SPEAKER_14]: and to provide standards for the placement, design, siting, safety, security, modification, and discontinuance of such establishments subject to reasonable conditions that protect public health, safety, and welfare.

51
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:22,136
[SPEAKER_14]: The full text of the amendment may be viewed in the office of the city clerk, room 103, or on the city's website at http://www.medfordma.org

52
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:32,780
[SPEAKER_14]: by clicking on current CD board filings.

53
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:42,127
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, the governor's order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law are in effect for this public hearing.

54
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:59,600
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd like to call the public hearing to order and ask acting community development or community development office director, Alicia Hunt to present the ordinance proposal.

55
00:06:03,098 --> 00:06:04,280
[SPEAKER_15]: So good evening.

56
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,402
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

57
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:07,644
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome, everybody.

58
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:18,097
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure how much background this needs based on how much advertising this has had over the last many years.

59
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:29,800
[SPEAKER_15]: But I have a couple of slides that were actually put together for a department head meeting that just touches on the background of where this came from.

60
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:37,502
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you'll just indulge me for like three minutes to like just make sure that everybody understands why we are

61
00:06:40,183 --> 00:06:40,523
[SPEAKER_15]: councilmembers.

62
00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:42,244
[SPEAKER_15]: Why are we talking about this at all?

63
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:55,273
[SPEAKER_15]: So, first of all, just to be clear, anything that is a zoning ordinance must go to the community development board for comment before the city

64
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:14,316
[SPEAKER_15]: And all right.

65
00:07:15,256 --> 00:07:19,638
[SPEAKER_15]: If somebody, I'm going to just do that again, just because I don't want to accidentally show the wrong thing.

66
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:25,001
[SPEAKER_15]: So you should be seeing the, yes, now it's got the right thing highlighted in green.

67
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:29,122
[SPEAKER_15]: So as you know, I did not prepare this and this is, I'm not going to go through the whole thing.

68
00:07:29,202 --> 00:07:34,224
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to give you a few little background pieces.

69
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:36,765
[SPEAKER_15]: In 2008, marijuana was decriminalized in Massachusetts.

70
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:40,107
[SPEAKER_15]: 2012, medical marijuana was legalized.

71
00:07:41,521 --> 00:07:49,624
[SPEAKER_15]: And in 2016, there was a vote to legalize, regulate, and tax marijuana for this is the recreational marijuana.

72
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:54,026
[SPEAKER_15]: So the voters in Massachusetts approved it.

73
00:07:55,447 --> 00:07:57,928
[SPEAKER_15]: And the voters in Medford approved it.

74
00:07:58,148 --> 00:08:02,070
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is actually key that the voters in Medford voted for it.

75
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,030
[SPEAKER_15]: The vote was 38,528.

76
00:08:16,316 --> 00:08:25,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, if your community voted for it in 2016, then your community must pass an ordinance as to how it will be allowed in your community.

77
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:31,580
[SPEAKER_15]: If you then wanted to not allow it, you would have to have another referendum in your community to not allow it.

78
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:51,911
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so this ordinance that is before you tonight has been touched by many departments in Medford, including our prevention and outreach, our director of diversity inclusion to the Board of Health, the police so many people have been involved in this, including the zoning Board of Appeals liaison.

79
00:08:52,912 --> 00:09:01,519
[SPEAKER_15]: But I do just want, for all clarity, when this says that the director of community and development was involved, that was not actually me personally.

80
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,121
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was not involved in the development.

81
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:08,505
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's just so much that I can actually speak to in the big picture here.

82
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:12,108
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just wanted to be clear about that.

83
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:16,612
[SPEAKER_15]: In my other role of energy and environment, I was not involved in the development of this.

84
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:21,050
[SPEAKER_15]: And so there's a general flow.

85
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:34,700
[SPEAKER_15]: The plan that is being put forward is to have, this is the plan that the city council has put together, and they have decided that the Zoning Board of Appeals would issue provisional special permits.

86
00:09:37,422 --> 00:09:37,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Um,

87
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:43,601
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there's also a place where the host community agreement has to be negotiated with the city.

88
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:53,794
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand they've put together a representative board that would be the negotiators for the city, it is not the mayor by herself it is three representatives of the city.

89
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,729
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think those are the pieces.

90
00:09:57,849 --> 00:10:09,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of these things here have also been changed since this presentation was put together, but those were the kind of the key facts that I just wanted to make sure everybody understood.

91
00:10:09,897 --> 00:10:12,118
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't the whim of somebody to do this.

92
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:22,285
[SPEAKER_15]: So before you tonight is the marijuana ordinance as the Medford City Council has drafted it.

93
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:33,213
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, some of you, hopefully most, all of you have read this and I think some of you are actually more familiar with marijuana ordinances than I am.

94
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:40,716
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so I do not feel that it's a great idea of our time for me to walk you through this entire document.

95
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:52,360
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, let me know if you would like me to do that or if you would like to take this forward and have your discussion.

96
00:10:59,514 --> 00:11:04,479
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me open the floor up to comments and questions from the board members.

97
00:11:12,848 --> 00:11:13,168
[SPEAKER_17]: Cless.

98
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:19,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Alicia, can you say a little bit about what specifically we are being asked to comment on today?

99
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:30,750
[SPEAKER_15]: So anything that is zoning related goes to the community development board for comment.

100
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:36,238
[SPEAKER_15]: So, this is a zoning amendment in, in and of itself.

101
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,101
[SPEAKER_15]: It's in.

102
00:11:40,302 --> 00:12:01,919
[SPEAKER_15]: ordinance and it's an amendment to the medford zoning and so the community development board is Asked to comment on all of this any and all of this By by statute like that's actually the law That it's transferred to you it is not coming to you because it can because the city council has said we want the community development board to weigh in on x and

103
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,525
[SPEAKER_15]: it is coming to you because they legally must refer it to you.

104
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:15,116
[SPEAKER_15]: So they have not actually stated if there's any portions or parts that they would like this board to weigh in on.

105
00:12:16,622 --> 00:12:29,751
[SPEAKER_14]: There has been a lot of conversation at the City Council level on this, and this is really coming to us for any additional recommendations or comments that we might want to make to them.

106
00:12:30,351 --> 00:12:43,140
[SPEAKER_14]: The City Council is under no requirement to listen to anything we say, and they can take action, but generally they do, you know,

107
00:12:44,107 --> 00:12:48,090
[SPEAKER_14]: take the community development board's comments very seriously into account.

108
00:12:52,653 --> 00:12:58,837
[SPEAKER_14]: It's also an opportunity, obviously, for another opportunity for the public to weigh in if they so choose.

109
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:08,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'll just say then that I didn't have any comments on what I read that was provided.

110
00:13:12,173 --> 00:13:16,198
[SPEAKER_28]: I second that I have no comments based on what I've read as is.

111
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:27,754
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know of any issues I don't see any issues, and not that I would need someone to point them out for me but without having heard from the public or any kind of opposition elsewhere, I have nothing to add.

112
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:33,936
[SPEAKER_14]: David, would you like to speak?

113
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:39,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Before David speaks, I will just say that technically this is also a public hearing.

114
00:13:39,997 --> 00:13:44,259
[SPEAKER_15]: So it is appropriate to open it up to public comment and then have additional discussion.

115
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:48,220
[SPEAKER_15]: But David, I believe you may have actually knowledge of this more than I do.

116
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,961
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I really, I'm not a pro in this area.

117
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:59,563
[SPEAKER_25]: I really didn't know anything about it going into it anymore, at least than what the general public knows about the issue in the Commonwealth.

118
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:01,524
[SPEAKER_25]: I did read

119
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:05,863
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, the proposed ordinance pretty closely and try to understand it.

120
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:10,984
[SPEAKER_25]: And I realized my brain probably works a little differently on these kinds of things, because it's kind of what I do all day.

121
00:14:12,024 --> 00:14:18,245
[SPEAKER_25]: And I had a lot of sort of things that I couldn't really reconcile in the drafting of it.

122
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:25,407
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think that that's really the right thing to talk about at our meeting and public meeting.

123
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:27,107
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like not a good use of everyone's time.

124
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:42,382
[SPEAKER_25]: But I do feel like the city needs to be very careful about what it's doing and can't just put a rubber stamp on this but really needs to think through how this thing is drafted what the pieces are how it works the regulations just little things like define terms not being consistent through it.

125
00:14:44,143 --> 00:14:49,426
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm, I'm happy to offer, you know, help on the side if that's something that somebody wants.

126
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:57,472
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought most relevant to our board is I found curious, I didn't see at least in the draft.

127
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:14,445
[SPEAKER_25]: sort of the idea of where, where would these different marijuana establishments land in our zoning, so you know what districts, would you allow these things to operate, what are the hours they would be allowed to operate that sort of detail.

128
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:19,489
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought would be most relevant to to us and the sorts of things that we talked about.

129
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,771
[SPEAKER_25]: I didn't see that in here.

130
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:45,054
[SPEAKER_25]: So I mean I have a whole bunch of very specific questions but I don't, I just don't feel like this is even ready for that discussion I feel like these are questions that are best posed to whoever is actually drafting this I guess the city, the city council which would be voting on ultimately.

131
00:15:48,836 --> 00:15:50,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you able to speak to that Alicia.

132
00:15:55,216 --> 00:16:04,320
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm actually going to ask our city solicitor some questions and she also was not the lawyer that drafted this it was drafted by our former city solicitor.

133
00:16:05,341 --> 00:16:09,963
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, but I'm just gonna ask her.

134
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:24,390
[SPEAKER_25]: Andre I did, I did have a communication with KP law in the between meetings here and I, I don't know how much I want, I should be sharing about that but just

135
00:16:25,172 --> 00:16:30,138
[SPEAKER_25]: I was told that, you know, their involvement was focused, you know they have a client, I guess the city.

136
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:40,011
[SPEAKER_25]: And so it seems like there would be some more drafting work that would need to be done on this thing before it's all squared away and ready to go.

137
00:16:46,702 --> 00:16:51,323
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to wait for the city solicitor to respond to Alicia.

138
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:55,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there any other comments or questions from other board members?

139
00:16:56,145 --> 00:17:01,226
[SPEAKER_14]: And if not, I can open up the hearing to public comment.

140
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:10,049
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, seeing none, let me open up the public hearing component.

141
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:13,690
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Alicia.

142
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:30,564
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just gonna say that I had been told that they had separated out from the zoning, some other regulations and all, but I actually haven't been privy to that at all.

143
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:42,373
[SPEAKER_17]: Could you say that one more time, just so I?

144
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:53,935
[SPEAKER_15]: I had been told that they had separated out a zoning piece and then more of rules and regulations.

145
00:17:53,955 --> 00:18:00,201
[SPEAKER_15]: I have not seen the other document that talks about rules and regulations.

146
00:18:00,261 --> 00:18:03,003
[SPEAKER_15]: They were working on passing the zoning piece first.

147
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see if there's, are there any members of the public who wish to speak on this matter?

148
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:28,863
[SPEAKER_17]: Annie, are you going to handle that?

149
00:18:34,564 --> 00:18:39,825
[SPEAKER_15]: So if members of the public want to speak, they should.

150
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:48,977
[SPEAKER_15]: go to the participants button and click the raise hand function, and then we can call on you.

151
00:18:49,197 --> 00:18:53,580
[SPEAKER_15]: If you raise your hand to your camera, it might be hard for us to see you.

152
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,862
[SPEAKER_15]: And actually, most people have their cameras off.

153
00:18:55,882 --> 00:19:02,406
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a feeling most people are here maybe for other issues.

154
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:06,889
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Annie, we have one person at least wants to raise their hand.

155
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,070
[SPEAKER_17]: Cyan.

156
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:17,974
[SPEAKER_30]: Hi, sorry, I was getting unmuted.

157
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:23,438
[SPEAKER_30]: So this is public comments for the marijuana change, right, to allow recreational?

158
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:24,239
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes.

159
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:24,359
[SPEAKER_30]: OK.

160
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,361
[SPEAKER_30]: I just want to say, first of all, I support this initiative.

161
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:30,063
[SPEAKER_30]: I think that Medford needs the tax revenue, and this is a good thing to do.

162
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:37,328
[SPEAKER_30]: I also want to point out that the original Massachusetts ballot initiative was to tax and regulate marijuana alcohol.

163
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,990
[SPEAKER_30]: So I hope that Medford will keep that in mind.

164
00:19:41,151 --> 00:20:07,732
[SPEAKER_30]: Also, my third comment was, I heard, I don't know the nature of the ordinance, but I heard something about adverse impacts, and I assume that relates to traffic and stuff, but I hope it doesn't relate to undesirable persons, because I feel that that's a racialized kind of term, because as you may know, marijuana prohibition has been racialized throughout history, and when it first started, it was a way to keep black people down and put them in prison, so.

165
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:17,281
[SPEAKER_30]: I just hope that Medford City Council is keeping that in mind when they discuss adverse impacts, that it's not going to be having people hanging around or something like that.

166
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:18,402
[SPEAKER_30]: So that's it.

167
00:20:20,504 --> 00:20:21,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Cyan.

168
00:20:21,124 --> 00:20:25,808
[SPEAKER_17]: I see Jason Zub.

169
00:20:25,828 --> 00:20:33,115
[SPEAKER_17]: You're unmuted, Jason.

170
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:37,466
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello?

171
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,046
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead, Jason.

172
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:39,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, we can hear you.

173
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:40,308
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

174
00:20:40,668 --> 00:20:47,972
[SPEAKER_24]: I was just wondering who would be deciding the zoning, if it's separated between what the rules are and what the zoning is, who decides where it goes?

175
00:20:55,056 --> 00:21:00,980
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good question, and I think that's what we're looking for some guidance from the city on the administration.

176
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:08,552
[SPEAKER_14]: That was my only question.

177
00:21:09,253 --> 00:21:09,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Jason.

178
00:21:09,953 --> 00:21:24,499
[SPEAKER_14]: So while we work on getting the answer to that question, which was also what David had raised, Lumberg, any other comments?

179
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:29,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Raise your hand in the chat box or send an email.

180
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:36,084
[SPEAKER_20]: Andre, I've unmuted John Witten from KP Law at his request.

181
00:21:36,743 --> 00:21:37,364
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, thank you.

182
00:21:38,785 --> 00:21:39,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, John?

183
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:44,970
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Chairman, can you hear me?

184
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:46,244
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I can.

185
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:48,685
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good evening, members of the board.

186
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:52,286
[SPEAKER_22]: Just a response to a couple comments so far.

187
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:58,608
[SPEAKER_22]: The way the draft appears to be written is there are no district divisions.

188
00:21:59,248 --> 00:22:06,651
[SPEAKER_22]: I think member Bloomberg had mentioned where these proposed facilities could occur and take place.

189
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:10,732
[SPEAKER_22]: So the current draft of the ordinance does not provide that kind of

190
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,441
[SPEAKER_22]: of segregation in terms of districts.

191
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:17,962
[SPEAKER_22]: And certainly the CD board could recommend that to the city Council.

192
00:22:17,982 --> 00:22:20,983
[SPEAKER_22]: And the city Council could revise the draft to include that.

193
00:22:21,743 --> 00:22:28,466
[SPEAKER_22]: In terms of the approval of new adult use marijuana facilities, they would all be by special permit.

194
00:22:29,126 --> 00:22:40,470
[SPEAKER_22]: And they would all be governed by what's called a community host agreement, sometimes called a host community agreement, which would be a contract entered into between the applicant and the city Council.

195
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:48,431
[SPEAKER_22]: and that becomes a governing document that really overarches what the special permit could allow.

196
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:56,313
[SPEAKER_22]: The special permit can include conditions on time of use, operation, parking, and so on, security, and related matters.

197
00:22:56,793 --> 00:23:00,494
[SPEAKER_22]: But the host agreement is more of a macro document.

198
00:23:00,994 --> 00:23:03,254
[SPEAKER_22]: It includes payments of fees.

199
00:23:03,454 --> 00:23:06,575
[SPEAKER_22]: It includes requirements that the city council wants to impose.

200
00:23:07,015 --> 00:23:09,417
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's really a belt-and-suspender approach.

201
00:23:09,858 --> 00:23:16,723
[SPEAKER_22]: The zoning ordinance itself controls many things, but the host community agreement controls even more.

202
00:23:17,144 --> 00:23:22,829
[SPEAKER_22]: So the two really are looked at together, and they're very fact-specific and very location-specific.

203
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:32,837
[SPEAKER_22]: So in one instance, the council might want to impose conditions of hours of operation that are more restrictive if it's closer to a residential neighborhood.

204
00:23:33,517 --> 00:23:38,701
[SPEAKER_22]: and or less restrictive if it's, for example, predominantly commercial in use.

205
00:23:39,322 --> 00:23:47,828
[SPEAKER_22]: So the ordinance sets out one track, and then the host community agreement sets out another track, and they're designed to work in tandem.

206
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:49,550
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

207
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,371
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, thank you, John.

208
00:23:51,451 --> 00:23:53,252
[SPEAKER_14]: That helps clarify things.

209
00:23:57,716 --> 00:24:02,600
[SPEAKER_14]: So David, your question, getting back to it, though, are you

210
00:24:04,223 --> 00:24:13,189
[SPEAKER_14]: would you like to make a recommendation that the Council designate certain zones in the city for this?

211
00:24:16,711 --> 00:24:27,317
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess, John, maybe before you get muted, I'm wondering whether, you know, this use needs to be incorporated into the zoning use table of the city.

212
00:24:27,337 --> 00:24:29,239
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems like it would be, so.

213
00:24:31,844 --> 00:24:33,946
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not clear about why that wouldn't be.

214
00:24:33,966 --> 00:24:34,507
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

215
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:39,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this a special permits allowed essentially anywhere?

216
00:24:39,412 --> 00:24:42,135
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's a great question, Mr. Chairman.

217
00:24:42,295 --> 00:24:47,500
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, you know, we are all kind of coming to this fairly new because this was drafted by others.

218
00:24:48,221 --> 00:24:54,047
[SPEAKER_22]: Generally speaking, especially with adult use marijuana, there are districts where it is not allowed at all.

219
00:24:54,727 --> 00:25:00,972
[SPEAKER_22]: And then there are those districts where the city wants to encourage the use or at least suggest an encouragement.

220
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:08,658
[SPEAKER_22]: So yeah, that would be done through the table of dimensional use provisions, as well as in the text itself.

221
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:16,304
[SPEAKER_22]: And that could be a recommendation from the CD board to kind of elaborate on those missing elements.

222
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:19,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Seems like something we would want to recommend.

223
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,171
[SPEAKER_14]: David, did you want to jump in on that further?

224
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:40,843
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't want to say too much because I feel like I won't be able to stop myself, but there are, I think, seven different categories of marijuana establishments, and each one could call for some different considerations in your zoning.

225
00:25:40,883 --> 00:25:51,692
[SPEAKER_25]: So you have the retailers, well, are retailers going to be, will they fit within the category of retail citywide without any sort of special notation and just a regular retailer?

226
00:25:52,163 --> 00:26:06,257
[SPEAKER_25]: What's a cultivator what's a, I mean, if there's a fair amount of work, I guess I feel like if, if this visit to our board is really just perfunctory it's something that has to happen along the way and the real work is going to happen later.

227
00:26:07,536 --> 00:26:10,680
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if anyone would say that, but that's one thing.

228
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:23,053
[SPEAKER_25]: If it's something that they really want us to vote on and we can feel comfortable that in endorsing something we've thought through it and we feel like it is something that can be implemented citywide.

229
00:26:23,754 --> 00:26:26,437
[SPEAKER_25]: Then I think we need to see something else.

230
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:29,140
[SPEAKER_25]: We need to see a revised updated draft to do that.

231
00:26:33,637 --> 00:26:36,618
[SPEAKER_22]: I would like to make a comment.

232
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,118
[SPEAKER_22]: I totally agree.

233
00:26:38,178 --> 00:26:41,659
[SPEAKER_22]: I have worked with a lot of communities on marijuana bylaws.

234
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:47,220
[SPEAKER_22]: And they almost always have the support and or the endorsement of the planning board.

235
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,121
[SPEAKER_22]: And in your case the community development board.

236
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:06,215
[SPEAKER_22]: you know, I'm speaking as an outsider here, of course, but I think I would recommend to the city council and certainly to the mayor that the CD boards approval and support is important here.

237
00:27:07,516 --> 00:27:10,418
[SPEAKER_22]: You're the planning board and this is a planning function.

238
00:27:11,158 --> 00:27:19,503
[SPEAKER_22]: So with respect to the multitude of uses that are allowed, kind of whether it's cultivation or retail sales, for example,

239
00:27:20,503 --> 00:27:22,364
[SPEAKER_22]: different communities have dealt with that differently.

240
00:27:22,584 --> 00:27:24,706
[SPEAKER_22]: In some communities, only retail is allowed.

241
00:27:24,926 --> 00:27:26,627
[SPEAKER_22]: In some communities, everything is allowed.

242
00:27:27,047 --> 00:27:35,512
[SPEAKER_22]: So you do, under the statutory scheme, you do get to pick and choose what the city of Medford believes is most appropriate for Medford.

243
00:27:36,012 --> 00:27:43,716
[SPEAKER_22]: And it may be just retail, it may be cultivation and retail, it may be whatever you and the city council feel is appropriate, but you do have quite a bit of flexibility there.

244
00:27:44,617 --> 00:27:47,498
[SPEAKER_22]: You're not stuck with, you have to accept all or nothing.

245
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:48,839
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not the case.

246
00:27:52,123 --> 00:27:58,907
[SPEAKER_21]: I did want to point out that I was just reading the specific requirements for marijuana retailers.

247
00:27:59,688 --> 00:28:10,395
[SPEAKER_21]: And it does say marijuana retailers shall only be permitted in the C2 and industrial zoning district as specified in the table of uses.

248
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:25,144
[SPEAKER_21]: Marijuana retailers shall not exceed 10,000 square feet in retail floor space That's as specific as it gets for the marijuana retailers, but it doesn't get any more specific on the other Types facilities.

249
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:29,405
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and and you could mr. Chairman fight if I could yes, please.

250
00:28:29,425 --> 00:28:29,445
[SPEAKER_22]: I

251
00:28:29,772 --> 00:28:29,932
[SPEAKER_22]: that.

252
00:28:30,092 --> 00:28:33,013
[SPEAKER_22]: And the board, I think both board members have commented on that.

253
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:38,636
[SPEAKER_22]: You could have higher standards for some things and lower standards for others.

254
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:42,217
[SPEAKER_22]: It is a menu of options and it gets complex.

255
00:28:42,317 --> 00:28:46,499
[SPEAKER_22]: But it is a good opportunity to plan for adult use

256
00:28:52,537 --> 00:29:01,520
[SPEAKER_15]: So as I look through the document, sort of again, it's very 17 pages, it's very dense to get through.

257
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:13,604
[SPEAKER_15]: On page nine, it mentions that there's a setback that it shunned.

258
00:29:14,064 --> 00:29:17,345
[SPEAKER_15]: Providing education in kindergarten or any grade

259
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,324
[SPEAKER_14]: Alicia, you're coming in and out.

260
00:29:20,785 --> 00:29:22,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you repeat that please?

261
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:24,052
[SPEAKER_14]: You're coming in and out on your sound a little bit.

262
00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:29,452
[SPEAKER_15]: apologize, the earbuds I had tested died.

263
00:29:31,173 --> 00:29:50,051
[SPEAKER_15]: So on page nine of the document, it says number four, sorry, I can't tell if it's a subsection, that a marijuana establishment shall not be located within 500 feet of a pre-existing public or private school providing education in kindergarten or

264
00:29:54,525 --> 00:30:03,587
[SPEAKER_15]: It talks about how the chamber, and then just number five is that marijuana establishments shall be conducted at a fixed location.

265
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:20,130
[SPEAKER_15]: Overall, my impression is that this gives a huge amount of power to the host community agreement to establish almost everything about what would be allowed and not allowed.

266
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:35,730
[SPEAKER_15]: that I had expected earlier drafts of this included specific zoning locations like things in our table of zoning, but those seem to no longer be part of this draft.

267
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:55,017
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, well, we don't necessarily know why that's been taken out, but again, since our role is as an advisory role, I think we can decide as a board what recommendations we might want to make and then move this along.

268
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:14,792
[SPEAKER_14]: So far, I think I've heard a desire to see specifically which marijuana establishments can be allowed in which uses and how it will be incorporated into the zoning use table of the city.

269
00:31:15,312 --> 00:31:21,657
[SPEAKER_14]: And also David had some, I think, comments about some drafting suggestions.

270
00:31:21,717 --> 00:31:27,642
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would say that those suggestions could be sent along under separate cover

271
00:31:28,362 --> 00:31:29,242
[SPEAKER_14]: to the city council.

272
00:31:35,444 --> 00:31:39,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there other things we might want to incorporate as a recommendation?

273
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:56,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Andre, the only other thing that I might add is I always like to see what some of our neighboring communities are doing on this and how we're either differing

274
00:31:57,685 --> 00:31:58,386
[SPEAKER_07]: following course.

275
00:32:04,412 --> 00:32:05,894
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't speak to that issue.

276
00:32:05,914 --> 00:32:12,181
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if anybody from the city can, or if John, you have any familiarity with that, John Witten.

277
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:19,684
[SPEAKER_22]: I do, Mr. Chairman, and I'd be happy to provide Alicia some examples of nearby cities.

278
00:32:19,724 --> 00:32:21,746
[SPEAKER_22]: Somerville is a good example.

279
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:24,789
[SPEAKER_22]: Some other smaller cities as well on the South Coast.

280
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:31,155
[SPEAKER_22]: And even some, you know, apples and oranges, smaller towns have some really good bylaws out there.

281
00:32:31,395 --> 00:32:34,198
[SPEAKER_22]: Of course, you know, it's apples and oranges.

282
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:37,139
[SPEAKER_22]: I would be happy to provide the board with some examples.

283
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,041
[SPEAKER_22]: There is no fixed model.

284
00:32:41,242 --> 00:32:45,164
[SPEAKER_22]: You really want to kind of tailor it to what Medford wants.

285
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:53,108
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think Alicia, what Alicia was saying earlier, I very much agree with, which is the host community agreement is very important.

286
00:32:53,748 --> 00:32:57,170
[SPEAKER_22]: But if I could, Mr. Chairman, just add, that's a political contract.

287
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,021
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, it's a contract entered into with the city council.

288
00:33:00,421 --> 00:33:04,723
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's not necessarily a land use protective device.

289
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:08,064
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's why I use the phrase belt and suspenders.

290
00:33:08,124 --> 00:33:09,084
[SPEAKER_22]: You really want both.

291
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:13,866
[SPEAKER_22]: You want the city council to do their thing, and then you want the regulatory boards to do their thing.

292
00:33:13,966 --> 00:33:17,908
[SPEAKER_22]: So the two go hand in hand, but one does not replace the other.

293
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:21,369
[SPEAKER_22]: And one can be more protective than the other, for example.

294
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:27,403
[SPEAKER_15]: So John, can you answer one question for me?

295
00:33:27,783 --> 00:33:39,632
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I've seen several versions of this, and I've sat in on a few of the more recent discussions, and I thought that the- Alicia, you froze.

296
00:33:39,692 --> 00:33:52,761
[SPEAKER_15]: Who were the people who, what, sorry, I thought this ordinance laid out who the committee was that was gonna negotiate that host community agreement, because that was being debated at one of the,

297
00:33:54,183 --> 00:33:58,724
[SPEAKER_15]: committee of the whole meetings, but I no longer see that section in here.

298
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:09,388
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if anybody, because it was several department heads who were going to be the body that negotiates that.

299
00:34:09,408 --> 00:34:12,329
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, Alicia, that I don't know.

300
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:14,990
[SPEAKER_22]: I wouldn't have that information.

301
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:19,771
[SPEAKER_22]: I can certainly try to find out if anybody in-house knows, but I think that preceded us.

302
00:34:22,682 --> 00:34:23,423
[SPEAKER_22]: the mayor and or the council.

303
00:34:23,443 --> 00:34:27,845
[SPEAKER_22]: By statute, it has to be the chief elected officials.

304
00:34:27,905 --> 00:34:29,326
[SPEAKER_22]: They can delegate it to a committee.

305
00:34:29,446 --> 00:34:32,388
[SPEAKER_22]: Alicia, that might be what you are recalling.

306
00:34:32,468 --> 00:34:33,509
[SPEAKER_22]: That is perfectly fine.

307
00:34:34,009 --> 00:34:38,152
[SPEAKER_22]: But it has to be executed by the mayor and or the council at the end of the day.

308
00:34:50,569 --> 00:35:15,165
[SPEAKER_14]: The board members be comfortable making a recommendation to the city council to include information about where the different uses are going to go in the Medford zoning land use table and also under separate cover to receive some drafting suggestions from David Blumberg.

309
00:35:19,037 --> 00:35:39,602
[SPEAKER_25]: Is there Andre is that maybe this is unprecedented in the way municipalities operate but the zoning board of appeals of course is set up here as the special permit granting authority is, is it appropriate for us to collaborate with the ZBA in some way and providing comments.

310
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:42,668
[SPEAKER_22]: question.

311
00:35:42,728 --> 00:35:45,830
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Chairman, another excellent question.

312
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:54,574
[SPEAKER_22]: The statute allows three special permit granting authorities, the city Council, the planning board, community development board or the ZBA.

313
00:35:55,274 --> 00:35:59,016
[SPEAKER_22]: It is not a preordained decision to be the ZBA.

314
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:03,918
[SPEAKER_22]: That becomes a political decision as to who is going to be issuing special

315
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:21,465
[SPEAKER_22]: which might work in Medford, the ZBA could be the special permit granting authority for some things, let's say cultivation for argument's sake, and the CD board could be the special permit granting authority for retail, just for argument's sake.

316
00:36:21,865 --> 00:36:23,326
[SPEAKER_22]: There could be a mix and match.

317
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:29,271
[SPEAKER_22]: and so there is no definitive right answer.

318
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:30,532
[SPEAKER_22]: It really depends.

319
00:36:30,852 --> 00:36:35,797
[SPEAKER_22]: Workload, planning issues, whatever you believe and the city council believes is appropriate.

320
00:36:35,877 --> 00:36:45,366
[SPEAKER_14]: And John, I think what David might have been suggesting is, is there a precedent for a collaborative process with the ZBA and the planning board?

321
00:36:45,626 --> 00:36:46,567
[SPEAKER_14]: To draft the ordinance?

322
00:36:48,766 --> 00:36:51,047
[SPEAKER_25]: to share comments on it, was what I had in mind.

323
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:52,708
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure, absolutely.

324
00:36:52,808 --> 00:37:07,757
[SPEAKER_22]: And David, if you were referring to once the special permit has been applied for, 48 section nine, which is the special permit provision, does require referral to all relevant city boards and commissions.

325
00:37:07,837 --> 00:37:10,739
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's already included in the statute.

326
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:16,243
[SPEAKER_22]: So if the ZBA is the special permit granting authority, they are supposed to send to you, the CD board,

327
00:37:16,963 --> 00:37:22,705
[SPEAKER_22]: the application for your comments and for every other special permit, and vice versa.

328
00:37:22,966 --> 00:37:31,169
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're issuing a special permit, you're required under 48 section 9 to send that application to other relevant city boards for their comments.

329
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,591
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure that's current practice.

330
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:43,834
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think we may want to make a specific recommendation to that effect if we want to make sure the ZBA

331
00:37:46,637 --> 00:37:47,498
[SPEAKER_14]: public comment on this item.

332
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:50,179
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to ask the city clerk to send a special permit application to us for comments.

333
00:37:57,344 --> 00:37:58,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we turn this into a motion?

334
00:38:16,722 --> 00:38:17,062
[SPEAKER_29]: That's all.

335
00:38:18,402 --> 00:38:18,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

336
00:38:21,443 --> 00:38:23,963
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll just give you one additional piece of information.

337
00:38:24,003 --> 00:38:28,024
[SPEAKER_15]: I apologize that some things are trickling into me.

338
00:38:29,204 --> 00:38:39,986
[SPEAKER_15]: So the City Council is planning to do a separate ordinance regarding a Cannabis Advisory Commission, and that that is going to be done separately from this ordinance.

339
00:38:41,326 --> 00:38:46,067
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe that that is who is going to negotiate the HCA that I heard.

340
00:38:50,236 --> 00:38:51,838
[SPEAKER_17]: HCA's host community agreement.

341
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:12,997
[SPEAKER_14]: So just to respond to the gentleman's comment that was read by the city staff, as Alicia Hunt mentioned at the beginning, we do not have the authority to not create one.

342
00:39:13,037 --> 00:39:22,339
[SPEAKER_14]: First of all, the community development board only has an advisory role to send recommendations to the city council.

343
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:25,920
[SPEAKER_14]: And even the city council itself cannot

344
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:33,373
[SPEAKER_14]: prohibit marijuana establishments in the city because of the public vote that was held.

345
00:39:35,253 --> 00:39:39,694
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to be clear on that for everyone.

346
00:39:42,535 --> 00:39:49,416
[SPEAKER_14]: I would entertain a motion now from the board on the items that we have discussed.

347
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:55,477
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe, David, can I ask you to take a stab at it?

348
00:39:55,497 --> 00:39:57,137
[SPEAKER_25]: I can try, sure.

349
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:19,744
[SPEAKER_25]: I think our motion is to recommend to the city council that more specificity is added in this ordinance as to locations table of use zoning details into the ordinance itself.

350
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:27,346
[SPEAKER_25]: And that this board would separately provide.

351
00:40:28,117 --> 00:40:36,445
[SPEAKER_25]: comments for the city council's consideration in connection with the draft ordinance presented to us today.

352
00:40:39,048 --> 00:40:46,916
[SPEAKER_15]: For those of us who are not lawyers, could you just clarify that by drafting, you're talking about copy editing?

353
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:53,893
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, anything that's substantive changes ought to be heard by the board, considered by the board.

354
00:40:54,293 --> 00:41:11,185
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think from an email exchange, I saw earlier that what you're thinking of is sort of more in line with details, lining up the language, making sure that there's no conflicting language in the document.

355
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:19,579
[SPEAKER_25]: That's, that's, that's my intent is not to change the substance that really should be for the city council.

356
00:41:23,763 --> 00:41:33,554
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe the separate comments should be shared among the board and it's something that we should consider next month or something so that people can see what we're talking about.

357
00:41:35,446 --> 00:41:40,708
[SPEAKER_14]: I do know that the city council is meeting on July 28th, and they are hoping to take this matter up.

358
00:41:40,868 --> 00:41:59,152
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd like to at least give them some, give them our recommendations now, and maybe within the next week, David, provide them with any kind of cleanup suggestions about the drafting that you might have.

359
00:41:59,172 --> 00:42:01,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that possible?

360
00:42:03,211 --> 00:42:05,394
[SPEAKER_25]: I can do that, sure.

361
00:42:07,738 --> 00:42:09,520
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a motion on the table from David.

362
00:42:11,892 --> 00:42:24,775
[SPEAKER_14]: to the city council to incorporate more details about where the different marijuana establishments would go in terms of the land use table and the zones of the city.

363
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:30,277
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was also, and David, I don't want to put words in your mouth.

364
00:42:30,397 --> 00:42:33,378
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think you actually said this part of it, but we had talked about the,

365
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:37,553
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

366
00:42:37,693 --> 00:42:44,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you asking the ZBA to send its special permit applications to the community development board?

367
00:42:44,515 --> 00:42:47,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that something you wanted to include?

368
00:42:47,476 --> 00:42:51,097
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm okay with or without that.

369
00:43:07,768 --> 00:43:12,289
[SPEAKER_25]: Correct, or to, I don't know who the addressee should be on that, but yes, I'll put something together.

370
00:43:13,029 --> 00:43:14,709
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

371
00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:16,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a second to that motion?

372
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:21,890
[SPEAKER_28]: I second the motion, Andre.

373
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:22,911
[SPEAKER_28]: This is Jackie Furtado.

374
00:43:23,651 --> 00:43:24,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Jackie.

375
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:26,791
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we'll have a roll call vote now.

376
00:43:28,712 --> 00:43:29,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Deanna Peabody?

377
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:30,552
[SPEAKER_29]: Aye.

378
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:32,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Katie McHugh?

379
00:43:32,912 --> 00:43:33,052
[SPEAKER_29]: Aye.

380
00:43:34,052 --> 00:43:34,773
[SPEAKER_14]: David Blumberg?

381
00:43:35,353 --> 00:43:35,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

382
00:43:36,893 --> 00:43:37,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Christy Dowd?

383
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:43,690
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, we could not hear you.

384
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:47,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Jackie Furtado.

385
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:49,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I miss any board members?

386
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:19,838
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, the next part of the agenda is a public hearing on a definitive subdivision plan and special permit for site plan review from Winthrop Estates, 541 and 551 Winthrop Street.

387
00:44:23,248 --> 00:44:26,171
[SPEAKER_14]: I will now read the public hearing notice.

388
00:44:26,752 --> 00:44:32,698
[SPEAKER_14]: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a combined public hearing on Thursday, July 16, 2020 at 6.30 p.m.

389
00:44:32,758 --> 00:44:43,249
[SPEAKER_14]: via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to a revised definitive subdivision plan and special permit for site plan review application submitted by Waypoint Development.

390
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:59,785
[SPEAKER_14]: The project includes the creation of a roadway and 10 lot subdivision, as shown on plans entitled Winthrop Estate Subdivision, 541 and 551 Winthrop Street, Medford, Massachusetts, prepared by Design Consultants, Inc., dated February 8, 2019, and revised June 24, 2019.

391
00:45:03,938 --> 00:45:06,862
[SPEAKER_14]: September 5th, 2019 and March 20th, 2020.

392
00:45:06,902 --> 00:45:22,201
[SPEAKER_14]: An earlier version of this application was denied by the Medford Community Development Board at a hearing on September 11th, 2019, but upon appeal has been remanded to the Community Development Board in light of additional information submitted by the applicant.

393
00:45:23,403 --> 00:45:41,898
[SPEAKER_14]: plans may be viewed in the office of the city clerk, room 103, the office of community development, room 308, or on the city's website at www.medfordma.org slash departments slash community hyphen development by clicking on current CD board filings.

394
00:45:43,299 --> 00:45:52,004
[SPEAKER_14]: As mentioned earlier, Governor Baker's order spending certain provisions of the open meeting law is in effect for this public hearing.

395
00:45:52,184 --> 00:46:10,735
[SPEAKER_14]: So I open the public hearing now and the order that we'll do this is that I'll invite Annie Streetman, our planner, to bring us all up to speed on what's happened because we have some new members of the board and also for the public.

396
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:16,615
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I will invite the applicant to present their proposal.

397
00:46:16,955 --> 00:46:23,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, since we have new board members, it will be helpful for them to explain what the project is.

398
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:29,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Then there'll be some discussion by the board, questions by the board, and we'll open it up to members of the public.

399
00:46:31,907 --> 00:46:36,531
[SPEAKER_14]: So Annie, could I ask you to bring us up to speed?

400
00:46:36,551 --> 00:46:38,052
[SPEAKER_20]: Sounds good.

401
00:46:38,092 --> 00:46:38,613
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Andre.

402
00:46:40,585 --> 00:46:49,370
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to reiterate because, again, we do have three new board members, so I think it will be helpful for the applicant to present and sort of give a summary of this as well.

403
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:51,611
[SPEAKER_20]: But I just wanted to give the high-level overview.

404
00:46:52,512 --> 00:47:00,857
[SPEAKER_20]: A lot of it Andre just mentioned, but I'll highlight that the petitioner is seeking both an approval of a definitive subdivision plan and a special permit for site plan review.

405
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:05,579
[SPEAKER_20]: And both of those are for the 10-lot subdivision at 541 and 551 Winthrop Street.

406
00:47:07,474 --> 00:47:20,565
[SPEAKER_20]: The original hearing was opened on May 15th, 2019 and was continued to September 11th, 2019 at the request of the applicant so that he could respond to questions by several department heads in their review of the project.

407
00:47:21,445 --> 00:47:36,017
[SPEAKER_20]: At the September hearing, the board found that information necessary to ensure the access for public safety vehicles and the provision of proper utilities to ensure adequate water for domestic and firefighting purposes, sewage and storm drainage was deficient and thus the definitive subdivision plan was denied.

408
00:47:36,516 --> 00:47:51,648
[SPEAKER_20]: The board also found that the site plan review application did not meet site plan review standards relative to imposing undue burden on sewers, sanitary, storm drains, water distribution systems, or similar public facilities that could have been avoided by modification to the plans and the special permit for site plan review was denied.

409
00:47:52,348 --> 00:48:00,595
[SPEAKER_20]: This decision was appealed by the applicant and the project was remanded back to the community development board to hold a new public hearing in light of additional information submitted

410
00:48:01,052 --> 00:48:02,313
[SPEAKER_20]: for consideration by the board.

411
00:48:02,934 --> 00:48:05,316
[SPEAKER_20]: And so revised materials were submitted to the board in June.

412
00:48:07,297 --> 00:48:09,860
[SPEAKER_20]: City departments reviewed and made some comments on that.

413
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:21,530
[SPEAKER_20]: And as a few materials were submitted today as well, given that many of you may not have had a chance to review that, and same with the city staff as well, I think I would ask that the

414
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:32,886
[SPEAKER_20]: to go over those items, what has been done since the September hearing, what was submitted as additional information today, and kind of discuss where that stands in that regard.

415
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:39,251
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Annie.

416
00:48:41,773 --> 00:48:46,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Could I ask the applicant now to present the proposal?

417
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:48,791
[SPEAKER_14]: And Annie, who do we have here?

418
00:48:48,851 --> 00:48:50,032
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I'll find you.

419
00:48:50,092 --> 00:48:52,814
[SPEAKER_20]: So Ed Champey and JJ Richa.

420
00:48:52,834 --> 00:48:55,096
[SPEAKER_20]: Here we go.

421
00:48:55,116 --> 00:48:55,857
[SPEAKER_20]: Unmute.

422
00:48:56,717 --> 00:48:57,658
[SPEAKER_20]: Ed, you are unmuted.

423
00:48:58,098 --> 00:48:58,399
[SPEAKER_31]: Great.

424
00:48:58,439 --> 00:48:58,799
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

425
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,842
[SPEAKER_14]: So Ed, if you could also just present your team.

426
00:49:02,902 --> 00:49:04,704
[SPEAKER_14]: If there's anybody else who's going to speak, that would be great.

427
00:49:05,384 --> 00:49:06,165
[SPEAKER_31]: OK, terrific.

428
00:49:06,185 --> 00:49:07,326
[SPEAKER_31]: So my name is Ed Champey.

429
00:49:07,346 --> 00:49:08,507
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm with Waypoint Development.

430
00:49:09,107 --> 00:49:12,050
[SPEAKER_31]: We're the owners of the project at 541 550 5 Winthrop Street.

431
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:21,200
[SPEAKER_31]: actually runs from 541 to 551 in Winthrop Street.

432
00:49:22,221 --> 00:49:24,843
[SPEAKER_31]: Also along the call with me is JJ Lariccia.

433
00:49:24,983 --> 00:49:26,864
[SPEAKER_31]: He's a project engineer with Waypoint.

434
00:49:27,884 --> 00:49:30,026
[SPEAKER_31]: Wayne of DCI is on the line.

435
00:49:30,506 --> 00:49:36,890
[SPEAKER_31]: Frank Leathers from GEI should be on the call as well, along with Michael Radner.

436
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:39,491
[SPEAKER_31]: Michael Radner being the landscape architect.

437
00:49:39,632 --> 00:49:41,873
[SPEAKER_31]: Frank Leathers, GEI, being the geotech engineer.

438
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:54,004
[SPEAKER_31]: civil engineering is Wayne at DCI, and again, myself, Ed Champy, one of the principals at White Point Development, and JJ Leriche, one of our project engineers.

439
00:49:55,524 --> 00:49:59,626
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'd like to start by saying thank you for having us tonight, Mr. Chairman, members of the board.

440
00:50:01,647 --> 00:50:10,930
[SPEAKER_31]: On our last hearing on September 11th, as Annie just mentioned, the project was denied, and it was based on a couple of items.

441
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:18,891
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, and I'll say my comments will be including but not limited to the items, and I think it will be appropriate for, um.

442
00:50:19,532 --> 00:50:22,033
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr Tim McGivern from the engineering department.

443
00:50:23,152 --> 00:50:24,173
[SPEAKER_31]: to go into more detail.

444
00:50:24,193 --> 00:50:42,004
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'll focus on the things that rather than go through the entire list, knowing that he'll probably go through his comments, I'll focus on the items that we believed, and that after going to the land court, that was stated as being the most pertinent, and we're open to discussion on other items as well.

445
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,882
[SPEAKER_31]: First and foremost was the drainage testing.

446
00:50:46,463 --> 00:50:53,109
[SPEAKER_31]: And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna explain what I think the biggest concerns were, and then we'll talk about what the project is.

447
00:50:53,429 --> 00:51:01,016
[SPEAKER_31]: And my gut would be that everybody has an inkling of what the project is, and we can describe it in further detail.

448
00:51:01,196 --> 00:51:08,783
[SPEAKER_31]: And maybe perhaps we can ask that the plans be put up on the screen, Annie, if you have that accessible.

449
00:51:10,477 --> 00:51:16,179
[SPEAKER_31]: We don't need to write this down, but I just think it'll be beneficial when we're trying to describe what the project actually is.

450
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,801
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I can share permission for that with a member of your team if they would like to do that.

451
00:51:21,281 --> 00:51:22,582
[SPEAKER_31]: Terrific, terrific, thank you.

452
00:51:23,282 --> 00:51:27,344
[SPEAKER_31]: So for now, one of the major issues was the drainage.

453
00:51:27,424 --> 00:51:30,425
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, the site is heavily concentrated with ledge.

454
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:38,528
[SPEAKER_31]: And the concern was that our original testing was 125 feet away from where the stormwater infiltration system will be going.

455
00:51:39,452 --> 00:51:49,222
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, so with multiple iterations, we came up with a testing plan that was, that was, um, that was not only

456
00:51:50,767 --> 00:51:58,031
[SPEAKER_31]: Our team, as well as Mr. McGibbon at the City of Method Engineering, agreed that it would be appropriate and it would be a proper way to test the site.

457
00:51:58,571 --> 00:52:07,396
[SPEAKER_31]: So through multiple, we had mentioned and we had sent out multiple times to the neighbors and the abutters because this required drilling and blasting.

458
00:52:08,256 --> 00:52:13,118
[SPEAKER_31]: We did drill and blast the area, prepped the area, and we completed the test on April 17th of 2020.

459
00:52:14,439 --> 00:52:19,602
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. Gibbon was on site that day and witnessed the tests, and the supporting data was sent to him after that.

460
00:52:21,364 --> 00:52:40,598
[SPEAKER_31]: So that was our primary goal on the definitive subdivision plan was testing that, also getting the high water table, and then coming up with a plan and a design that used all that data and came up with a reasonable solution for the project, and we've done that.

461
00:52:41,298 --> 00:52:49,064
[SPEAKER_31]: In addition to that, which is part of the site plan review, or the denial for the site plan review, would be that the project

462
00:52:50,006 --> 00:52:57,510
[SPEAKER_31]: you know, it was it was proposed that it that it was determined to create an undue burden and the special permit for the site plan review was denied.

463
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:06,014
[SPEAKER_31]: So through the process, we had tested the water flow from the hydrants, and the water flow was sufficient.

464
00:53:07,154 --> 00:53:12,017
[SPEAKER_31]: At that point, we were requested by the city of Medford Water Department to actually calibrate

465
00:53:12,637 --> 00:53:21,763
[SPEAKER_31]: the gauges, which was UTS, Underground Testing Services, perform the testing, calibrate the gauges, and then test again.

466
00:53:22,043 --> 00:53:25,446
[SPEAKER_31]: On the second test, David Proctor from the Water Department was on site.

467
00:53:25,466 --> 00:53:26,306
[SPEAKER_31]: He witnessed the test.

468
00:53:26,867 --> 00:53:29,889
[SPEAKER_31]: And again, we found the flow rate to be appropriate.

469
00:53:30,549 --> 00:53:32,290
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think Tim will talk to that a bit as well.

470
00:53:32,851 --> 00:53:37,334
[SPEAKER_31]: So we believe that that solved the concern with regard to the flow rate.

471
00:53:37,874 --> 00:53:41,677
[SPEAKER_31]: There will likely be a test which will involve

472
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:55,915
[SPEAKER_31]: the hydrant, which we are going to install, should we get approved, at the top of Winthrop Street Estates, which will be likely named other than Winthrop Street Estates, but for today's discussion, that's what it is.

473
00:53:57,456 --> 00:54:06,099
[SPEAKER_31]: And again, proving that the, showing that there's sufficient water pressure to, pretty much for the fire prevention.

474
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,581
[SPEAKER_31]: The flow rate is

475
00:54:11,035 --> 00:54:14,917
[SPEAKER_31]: is primarily governed by the requirements for fire prevention.

476
00:54:15,137 --> 00:54:18,278
[SPEAKER_31]: It is not governed by domestic water use.

477
00:54:18,478 --> 00:54:20,339
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a significant difference between the two.

478
00:54:22,539 --> 00:54:28,122
[SPEAKER_31]: An example, and again, Tim can comment on these facts or opinions as you'd like.

479
00:54:29,542 --> 00:54:31,423
[SPEAKER_31]: At a 500 gallon per minute flow rate,

480
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:37,906
[SPEAKER_31]: The stats say that you can fight two host fires at the same time.

481
00:54:39,507 --> 00:54:41,708
[SPEAKER_31]: Our testing shows that we're going to have 1,000 gallons a minute.

482
00:54:42,588 --> 00:54:46,969
[SPEAKER_31]: And so think of 1,000 gallons a minute out of a fire main or water main, rather.

483
00:54:47,689 --> 00:54:52,511
[SPEAKER_31]: And the general water requirement per person in a house is about 94 gallons a day.

484
00:54:53,231 --> 00:55:00,653
[SPEAKER_31]: So clearly, the domestic water use is not governing the requirement for the water main.

485
00:55:00,693 --> 00:55:02,394
[SPEAKER_31]: It's governed by the fire prevention.

486
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:12,595
[SPEAKER_31]: So, J.J., do you have the site plan itself, the plan view that you can put on the screen, or that you can ask Annie to let you share the screen?

487
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,080
[SPEAKER_17]: Annie, can you see J.J.

488
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:24,340
[SPEAKER_17]: on?

489
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:24,940
[SPEAKER_17]: I see.

490
00:55:27,302 --> 00:55:27,782
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm here.

491
00:55:27,802 --> 00:55:29,363
[SPEAKER_20]: J.J., you are now a co-host.

492
00:55:29,523 --> 00:55:29,823
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm here.

493
00:55:30,811 --> 00:55:33,152
[SPEAKER_20]: JJ, can you... And you should be able to share now, JJ.

494
00:55:38,413 --> 00:55:40,894
[SPEAKER_31]: What we're gonna show is the site itself.

495
00:55:42,034 --> 00:55:53,997
[SPEAKER_31]: The site is 350 feet wide and another... It's not a rectangle, but give or take it's 300 feet deep, 100 and some odd thousand square feet of land.

496
00:55:55,729 --> 00:56:02,156
[SPEAKER_31]: And this process this process has been going on for quite some time I'm not sure how many of the board members know, I think we bought this land in 2014.

497
00:56:04,258 --> 00:56:07,381
[SPEAKER_31]: We had an original plan, which was 11 house lots.

498
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:16,051
[SPEAKER_31]: And we had three additional houses on winter street under agreement and we were going to the road was going to was going to enter down by where the fells way.

499
00:56:19,836 --> 00:56:22,998
[SPEAKER_31]: was going to enter the end was going to run up around the backside.

500
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,420
[SPEAKER_31]: We spent about a year and a half planning it.

501
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,283
[SPEAKER_31]: The road grade was at 8% the requirement in methods at seven.

502
00:56:31,104 --> 00:56:31,804
[SPEAKER_31]: And we were denied.

503
00:56:33,425 --> 00:56:40,450
[SPEAKER_31]: At that time, we the next we thought we'd try and just go for seven house lots facing the front of Winthrop Street.

504
00:56:41,251 --> 00:56:43,212
[SPEAKER_31]: With the right of way that's running across the site.

505
00:56:44,373 --> 00:56:45,734
[SPEAKER_31]: That was that was going to be a

506
00:56:48,496 --> 00:56:57,849
[SPEAKER_31]: to start working, and we met with the planning director at the time, and we were told that we weren't going to get the additional three, and we stopped work and started replanning again.

507
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:04,778
[SPEAKER_31]: And that's what brings us to the plan that we have now, which is 10 house laws coming straight in off Winthrop Street.

508
00:57:06,877 --> 00:57:11,740
[SPEAKER_31]: There are a couple of things that the project's doing while we're waiting for the screen to come up.

509
00:57:13,261 --> 00:57:19,125
[SPEAKER_31]: We've added a few items that we think are beneficial to the neighbors and the community.

510
00:57:20,005 --> 00:57:31,173
[SPEAKER_31]: One of which is, there was a water line for 555 Winthrop Street, which was running across the property.

511
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:34,895
[SPEAKER_31]: We actually recently,

512
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:44,472
[SPEAKER_31]: connected a new waterline for them and ran it up the right away so that it would no longer be an encroachment, which essentially gave them a new waterline.

513
00:57:44,492 --> 00:57:49,953
[SPEAKER_31]: We're also, for 553 and 555 Winthrop Street, we are extending the right of way.

514
00:57:51,013 --> 00:58:03,015
[SPEAKER_31]: We still need to do the paperwork on that, but we've offered to extend the right of way so that the right of way would no longer enter off of an incredibly steep slope off of Winthrop Street, and it'll actually run into our new road

515
00:58:05,005 --> 00:58:06,225
[SPEAKER_31]: you know, adjacent to lot one.

516
00:58:06,786 --> 00:58:10,527
[SPEAKER_31]: In doing that, we're also planning on paving that road so that there'll be a new surface on it.

517
00:58:10,547 --> 00:58:14,288
[SPEAKER_31]: It probably hasn't been paved since it was originally built.

518
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:34,455
[SPEAKER_31]: Additionally, and we did this a couple of years ago, and we're gonna do it again, assuming that things are moving forward, which is we installed barriers on the opposite side of the street so that Lorraine Road would have a soft shoulder to walk on that was protected from traffic.

519
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:42,159
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, we did that with the expectation, or at least we were told that the DPW was going to pave that area.

520
00:58:42,179 --> 00:58:45,825
[SPEAKER_31]: So, but it didn't get paved and it ended up.

521
00:58:47,022 --> 00:58:52,424
[SPEAKER_31]: Most of the people walking around the barrier on Winthrop Street instead of walking on the soft shoulder.

522
00:58:52,464 --> 00:59:10,770
[SPEAKER_31]: So our goal now is to put up the barriers again, and only this time either add crushed stone on the far side so that the walking traffic would be dry and out of the soft shoulder, or if it would be allowed by the city, we're amicable to putting a temporary asphalt sidewalk walkway in there.

523
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:14,932
[SPEAKER_31]: On the other side of Lorain Road, which is

524
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:18,771
[SPEAKER_31]: we are planning with over towards where the bus stop is.

525
00:59:18,791 --> 00:59:33,061
[SPEAKER_31]: We're planning on putting a cement sidewalk around the corner with a handicap ramp and a crosswalk which leads across Winthrop Street and on to across from Lorain Road to Winthrop Street.

526
00:59:33,101 --> 00:59:36,924
[SPEAKER_31]: You can see it in the bottom left hand section of the plan.

527
00:59:36,964 --> 00:59:39,466
[SPEAKER_31]: If you go down to the bottom, you can see where the crossroads comes across.

528
00:59:41,917 --> 00:59:49,343
[SPEAKER_31]: So, JJ, could you please roll your cursor across where the right-of-way is now gonna, is dead-ending into Winthrop Street?

529
00:59:49,984 --> 00:59:51,946
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, so you can see where the cursor is right now.

530
00:59:52,406 --> 01:00:06,478
[SPEAKER_31]: That's where the traffic, or there's two houses, going to 553 and 555 Winthrop Street will enter there, and it will run up that right-of-way, which goes up across the backside of the property.

531
01:00:07,859 --> 01:00:09,080
[SPEAKER_31]: If we zoom out a little, JJ,

532
01:00:10,558 --> 01:00:21,890
[SPEAKER_31]: The project itself right now has a significant elevation, so other than the area that's already been drilled and blasted, we will be blasting the site, getting the elevation down.

533
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:29,397
[SPEAKER_31]: The main reason for it is to reach the 7% grade that Medford has for a standard in its rules and regulations for subdivision.

534
01:00:30,238 --> 01:00:33,979
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, so with that, that's that's a large reason for the cut.

535
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:38,641
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, and that's why the road is where it is and design the way it is.

536
01:00:39,301 --> 01:00:40,302
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, there's.

537
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:43,703
[SPEAKER_31]: Within that there's a substantial, um.

538
01:00:45,021 --> 01:01:03,026
[SPEAKER_31]: area which which is which we are stabilizing the Blasted ledge afterwards with a with a dowel system and it'll be essentially faced with with shot Creek and along with some one-to-one graded areas for for For plantings and whatnot.

539
01:01:03,846 --> 01:01:08,347
[SPEAKER_31]: So if you can JJ, could you please roll the cursor from the left side of the site?

540
01:01:09,767 --> 01:01:11,428
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah from the from the edge a lot three

541
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:19,148
[SPEAKER_31]: That's where the wall starts and then JJ run it around the site and show and I'll and stop it.

542
01:01:19,488 --> 01:01:20,529
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll stop you when it stops.

543
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:24,191
[SPEAKER_31]: And the wall runs around and it stops on the far side.

544
01:01:25,171 --> 01:01:28,293
[SPEAKER_31]: That has been engineered carefully.

545
01:01:28,934 --> 01:01:30,695
[SPEAKER_31]: It's gone through the process, both with.

546
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:40,879
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. McGivern, as well as Frank Leathers from GEI, with the wall itself, how it strains, there's a maintenance plan for it.

547
01:01:40,979 --> 01:01:44,981
[SPEAKER_31]: The requirement for the maintenance on that wall is the Homeowners Association.

548
01:01:46,801 --> 01:01:54,505
[SPEAKER_31]: And there's also a plateau at the top where it flattens off or has a slight incline before it reaches a fence.

549
01:01:54,545 --> 01:01:59,187
[SPEAKER_31]: And that fence, the fenced area is also maintained by the HOA.

550
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:04,994
[SPEAKER_31]: When you get past that wall is where you get to on the far right, if you move down a bit.

551
01:02:05,374 --> 01:02:07,797
[SPEAKER_31]: That's a one-to-one slope where it's a vegetated area.

552
01:02:08,278 --> 01:02:12,843
[SPEAKER_31]: And when you go further down towards Winthrop Street, it becomes more of a two-to-one slope.

553
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:18,405
[SPEAKER_31]: When you get down towards Winthrop Street, you'll notice that rectangle that's there with multiple chambers in it.

554
01:02:19,046 --> 01:02:22,009
[SPEAKER_31]: That is the stormwater infiltration system.

555
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:28,836
[SPEAKER_31]: So as it sits now, it's designed for the capacity of the road as well, and I think it's for 100-year storm plus.

556
01:02:29,737 --> 01:02:33,522
[SPEAKER_31]: And it also is set up in the HOA for the maintenance.

557
01:02:35,136 --> 01:02:52,490
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. McGiven and I have discussed this at length, and the goal being that the maintenance of the walls and the fencing and the stormwater infiltration system does not reside within the requirements for Medford, but the city of Medford, it requires for the Homeowners Association.

558
01:02:53,051 --> 01:03:04,280
[SPEAKER_31]: The Homeowners Association is set up, we have a draft of it, and all the operational maintenance that goes along with these items that I'm discussing

559
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:05,761
[SPEAKER_31]: are in there.

560
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:23,714
[SPEAKER_31]: If you go to the far left-hand side, JJ, and if we start walking up the right-of-way a little bit, so there's not only a fence, but there's a guardrail, and that is to make sure that that right-of-way is protected and traffic is protected that's running up there.

561
01:03:23,754 --> 01:03:30,299
[SPEAKER_31]: So that is also part of the HOA association as far as the maintenance on the guardrail and the fence.

562
01:03:32,102 --> 01:03:35,303
[SPEAKER_31]: The smallest lot is around 7,500 square feet.

563
01:03:36,163 --> 01:03:38,984
[SPEAKER_31]: And the largest lot is just over 10,000 square feet.

564
01:03:39,664 --> 01:03:45,205
[SPEAKER_31]: The city of Medford requirement is, I believe it's 7,000 or 7,500 square feet.

565
01:03:45,285 --> 01:03:47,845
[SPEAKER_31]: So none of the lots are requesting any relief.

566
01:03:48,426 --> 01:03:50,006
[SPEAKER_31]: The road is not requesting any relief.

567
01:03:50,866 --> 01:03:58,688
[SPEAKER_31]: And from what we gathered over the past six years, the project itself is not requiring zoning relief.

568
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:07,202
[SPEAKER_31]: With that said, I'll leave it to questions, and Mr. McGiven's comments were lengthy, but we did discuss them.

569
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:15,982
[SPEAKER_31]: and Mr. McGiven, and we've sent him back today the discussion that we had in writing.

570
01:04:17,222 --> 01:04:23,764
[SPEAKER_31]: And with it, we submitted documents and concerns that would help just paper some of the discussions.

571
01:04:23,824 --> 01:04:28,505
[SPEAKER_31]: So it was a discussion that we had a couple of days ago, and then the information was sent today.

572
01:04:29,425 --> 01:04:33,626
[SPEAKER_31]: We've sent information on the right of way and the easements.

573
01:04:33,926 --> 01:04:36,627
[SPEAKER_31]: It's a fairly complicated right of way.

574
01:04:37,587 --> 01:04:42,531
[SPEAKER_31]: where 553 and 555 Winthrop Street have a right of way to get in and a right of way to get out.

575
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:46,013
[SPEAKER_31]: Essentially, the two housing lots are landlocked.

576
01:04:48,155 --> 01:04:51,677
[SPEAKER_31]: So again, with that, I'm open to answering questions or open discussion.

577
01:04:57,081 --> 01:05:02,445
[SPEAKER_31]: We also have some renderings if you're not used to reading plans, and it might make more sense to see that.

578
01:05:02,938 --> 01:05:06,139
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think if you could throw the renderings up, that would be great.

579
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,601
[SPEAKER_14]: These are not new renderings, though, are they?

580
01:05:09,641 --> 01:05:11,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Are these the ones from like 18 months ago?

581
01:05:11,682 --> 01:05:13,283
[SPEAKER_31]: Correct.

582
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:15,524
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, but it would be good to see them.

583
01:05:16,064 --> 01:05:18,125
[SPEAKER_31]: Sure, yeah, the project hasn't changed.

584
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,227
[SPEAKER_17]: Underground testing has changed for the project.

585
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:47,641
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's happening.

586
01:05:47,681 --> 01:06:01,191
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to remind everybody that members of the public can submit comments via email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

587
01:06:01,491 --> 01:06:10,418
[SPEAKER_14]: That's OCD, the Office of Community Development, OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

588
01:06:10,999 --> 01:06:13,901
[SPEAKER_14]: Or you can also weigh in via phone, just 781-393.

589
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:20,636
[SPEAKER_14]: 24807813932480 Thank you city staff is monitoring both of those methods of weighing in.

590
01:06:20,656 --> 01:06:21,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr Chairman, may I. Yes.

591
01:06:21,717 --> 01:06:21,997
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

592
01:06:31,885 --> 01:06:35,107
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, what we're looking at now is a is a is a mark of you.

593
01:06:35,147 --> 01:06:36,047
[SPEAKER_31]: It is drawn to scale.

594
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:39,949
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, and it's showing what the view will look like.

595
01:06:40,369 --> 01:06:44,031
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, this is between the gas station and Lorraine Road.

596
01:06:44,071 --> 01:06:48,413
[SPEAKER_31]: If you were looking across the street, JJ, can you go to the ghost view next, please?

597
01:06:50,559 --> 01:07:06,062
[SPEAKER_31]: So what we did here was we had, we had a mock up done where you can see where the, where the, the wall surfaces are going to be that are behind the houses, so you can see in some cases there's green scape, and there's a one to one or two to one slope.

598
01:07:06,955 --> 01:07:21,581
[SPEAKER_31]: And then as you go further up into the cul-de-sac, you can see that it starts becoming the Jip Crete, or in this case, it's gonna be Shaw Crete, will be, again, it's behind the houses, but it does exist.

599
01:07:21,721 --> 01:07:29,764
[SPEAKER_31]: And there are some plans with, and Mr. Radner's on the call here, if we wanna discuss landscaping and how this is all gonna play out.

600
01:07:30,804 --> 01:07:31,725
[SPEAKER_31]: JJ, could you go to,

601
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,501
[SPEAKER_31]: Just any any of the views and I'll discuss them as we go through.

602
01:07:36,581 --> 01:07:39,262
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, this is this this view is is heading west.

603
01:07:40,243 --> 01:07:53,789
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, so it's probably more from from where the from where the gas station is and you can see the um, the the right away Which is ramp which is extended which then becomes part of the entrance to Winthrop street estates.

604
01:07:54,469 --> 01:08:00,492
[SPEAKER_17]: Um JJ next slide, please And one more we already discussed this one

605
01:08:02,815 --> 01:08:03,796
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

606
01:08:03,876 --> 01:08:12,642
[SPEAKER_31]: The crosswalk is shown here, which runs from the corner of Lorain Road over to the corner of Winthrop Street Estates where the ADA compliant ramps will be installed.

607
01:08:13,482 --> 01:08:14,883
[SPEAKER_31]: That's something I discussed earlier.

608
01:08:15,404 --> 01:08:25,190
[SPEAKER_31]: So this is the idea behind the project is that the houses will, you know, front door garage facing the street, you know, two, you know, three story, three and a half story.

609
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:28,453
[SPEAKER_31]: I think the zoning requirements are within 35 feet of the meaning of the roof.

610
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:31,795
[SPEAKER_31]: Of course, we plan on adhering to all those requirements.

611
01:08:35,667 --> 01:08:36,568
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm open for questions.

612
01:08:37,269 --> 01:08:43,454
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you just go back to the mock up that's the straight on into the subdivision?

613
01:08:44,515 --> 01:08:45,056
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that one.

614
01:08:45,656 --> 01:08:45,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

615
01:08:56,086 --> 01:08:59,609
[SPEAKER_14]: And can you, given the fact that there's this, the wall, uh,

616
01:09:01,652 --> 01:09:09,774
[SPEAKER_14]: behind a number of the homes, can you just go over what you're doing in terms of safety of fencing behind area.

617
01:09:10,314 --> 01:09:13,135
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, so at the top of the wall around the perimeter of the site.

618
01:09:13,535 --> 01:09:16,876
[SPEAKER_31]: There is a six foot fence that's running around the entire perimeter of the site.

619
01:09:17,576 --> 01:09:21,097
[SPEAKER_31]: And once you on on both sides of the set of the fence.

620
01:09:21,718 --> 01:09:24,859
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a, there's a slightly sloped area.

621
01:09:25,239 --> 01:09:29,220
[SPEAKER_31]: So two things are happening there one is none of the water from our property is.

622
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:34,161
[SPEAKER_31]: is, is flowing to the adjacent properties.

623
01:09:34,661 --> 01:09:42,684
[SPEAKER_31]: And at the same time, once you're, you know, if you were to be on either side of the fence, you wouldn't be at risk of falling down the embankment.

624
01:09:45,725 --> 01:09:49,866
[SPEAKER_14]: What kind of fences are you planning there?

625
01:09:49,906 --> 01:09:54,448
[SPEAKER_31]: My expectation would be especially around the backside of the property that would be a black chain link.

626
01:10:00,893 --> 01:10:08,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, let me open up for comments and questions by board members before we get to members of the public.

627
01:10:18,744 --> 01:10:22,907
[SPEAKER_14]: Any board members want to speak up or should we go to the public?

628
01:10:23,387 --> 01:10:24,067
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Klaus.

629
01:10:24,688 --> 01:10:25,328
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thanks Klaus.

630
01:10:27,908 --> 01:10:31,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is Tim McGibbon gonna speak tonight?

631
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:34,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, thank you actually for reminding me.

632
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's throw it to Tim before we do that.

633
01:10:40,218 --> 01:10:48,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Tim, so I know the big issues that were in front of the court were the drainage issues.

634
01:10:48,164 --> 01:10:54,408
[SPEAKER_14]: We had asked them for some more information and to address concerns that we had.

635
01:10:55,789 --> 01:11:00,472
[SPEAKER_14]: You've gotten some additional information, had some more conversations with the developer.

636
01:11:01,233 --> 01:11:03,054
[SPEAKER_14]: What's your take on things right now?

637
01:11:04,155 --> 01:11:09,499
[SPEAKER_11]: They've actually, since the remand, they've come quite far.

638
01:11:10,093 --> 01:11:14,955
[SPEAKER_11]: even since the review letter from July 9th.

639
01:11:15,296 --> 01:11:19,197
[SPEAKER_11]: They've come quite far, submitted quite an amount of additional information.

640
01:11:19,217 --> 01:11:22,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Right before this meeting, I actually finished going through it all.

641
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:29,002
[SPEAKER_11]: So they've addressed many of the concerns.

642
01:11:29,042 --> 01:11:37,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'm at the point where just sorting through what conditions come out of my comments for an approval.

643
01:11:40,047 --> 01:11:56,962
[SPEAKER_11]: The big issue, just to give my summary, was the definitive plan was submitted without empirical data to demonstrate that the stormwater could be infiltrated into the ledge beneath the project.

644
01:11:59,825 --> 01:12:02,107
[SPEAKER_11]: And not only that, but their drainage design

645
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:04,281
[SPEAKER_11]: hinges on that.

646
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:05,942
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a critical piece of their design.

647
01:12:06,022 --> 01:12:15,752
[SPEAKER_11]: So I recommended denial based off of the lack of that information as well as the completion of the rest of the information as well.

648
01:12:17,053 --> 01:12:23,259
[SPEAKER_11]: The testing was done to appropriate standards, ASTM methods.

649
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:34,226
[SPEAKER_11]: From what I could tell, everything was done properly, and the capacity of that ledge is very, very high as far as stormwater goes and infiltrated stormwater.

650
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:39,009
[SPEAKER_11]: So they satisfied that concern that I had.

651
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:46,714
[SPEAKER_11]: than as far, most of the other things were information that needed to come in.

652
01:12:48,595 --> 01:12:56,017
[SPEAKER_11]: The other sort of utility issue that still needs a little bit of work, but I think we're close, is the fire flows.

653
01:12:56,137 --> 01:13:10,060
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just, the subdivision control law basically says that the project needs to create a way that has proper infrastructure in it to service the, whatever, the homes and the buildings

654
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,502
[SPEAKER_11]: in the development.

655
01:13:12,802 --> 01:13:19,087
[SPEAKER_11]: So they have an eight-inch cement line duct line pipe that will provide water to the development, the water supply.

656
01:13:19,107 --> 01:13:22,130
[SPEAKER_11]: The proposal is the line in Winthrop Street.

657
01:13:22,851 --> 01:13:24,752
[SPEAKER_11]: That line in Winthrop Street is old.

658
01:13:25,313 --> 01:13:30,557
[SPEAKER_11]: It does have issues with capacity and water quality.

659
01:13:31,538 --> 01:13:34,661
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we did talk about that quite at length.

660
01:13:35,762 --> 01:13:40,788
[SPEAKER_11]: as far as what is the project responsibility, what is the city responsibility there.

661
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:46,775
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, one of the project responsibilities is obviously the meeting fire code.

662
01:13:47,075 --> 01:13:51,360
[SPEAKER_11]: So as Mr. Champion described, the, the, the, the,

663
01:13:54,010 --> 01:14:05,919
[SPEAKER_11]: model that they provided for the flow shows, you know, somewhere in between 980 to 1020 gallons per minute at 20 psi, which is the standard.

664
01:14:06,539 --> 01:14:18,648
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, in the last just 48 hours, one of the things that just remains a concern for me is making sure that the code requirement for a building

665
01:14:19,403 --> 01:14:24,149
[SPEAKER_11]: up on this development meets the actual flow rate coming out of the pipe.

666
01:14:24,189 --> 01:14:30,096
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's something you can't really demonstrate until the pipe is actually in the ground and the hydrant is installed.

667
01:14:31,378 --> 01:14:36,004
[SPEAKER_11]: The model shows that it will meet that 1,000 gallons per minute benchmark.

668
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:43,647
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it becomes a question for the fire prevention team here in Medford as to what code number they're using.

669
01:14:44,547 --> 01:14:49,429
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that there was discussion about having the building sprinkled.

670
01:14:49,889 --> 01:14:52,490
[SPEAKER_11]: That reduces that fire flow code requirement.

671
01:14:53,830 --> 01:15:08,010
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know that that's still out there but as far as the capacity of the system that they're that they're proposing that is sufficient eight inch line for the way is is sufficient and what they're using materials is sufficient.

672
01:15:10,222 --> 01:15:28,088
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there has to be some sort of discussion about what's the condition if, you know, if they don't meet code, for whatever reason, if the fire prevention officer wants to see a higher number or whatever, it is their purview.

673
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:31,689
[SPEAKER_11]: There are things that can be done for the project to sort of remedy that.

674
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:38,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, you know, 1,000 gallons per minute is one benchmark that folks talk about.

675
01:15:38,051 --> 01:15:38,512
[SPEAKER_11]: 500 is another.

676
01:15:40,107 --> 01:15:43,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Calculating fire flow and requirements is its own science.

677
01:15:43,989 --> 01:15:48,712
[SPEAKER_11]: The NFPA publishes a book on it and how to do it.

678
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:51,474
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's dozens of ways to calculate required fire flow.

679
01:15:51,834 --> 01:15:57,118
[SPEAKER_11]: It's what does the fire prevention officer want to see, and then can the project meet that.

680
01:15:57,558 --> 01:16:04,422
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a concern on the table, but I don't think it's definitely not a showstopper what the project is providing.

681
01:16:07,078 --> 01:16:15,047
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, is appropriate for the size of the development, basically, an eight-inch ductile iron pipe bringing water to the site.

682
01:16:16,328 --> 01:16:17,249
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's that.

683
01:16:17,749 --> 01:16:20,953
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, you know, there's a couple of things that are conditions.

684
01:16:21,093 --> 01:16:23,796
[SPEAKER_11]: I counted about 13 conditions that I would recommend.

685
01:16:24,263 --> 01:16:25,624
[SPEAKER_11]: for this project to the board.

686
01:16:26,425 --> 01:16:32,950
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there was a couple of board opinions that I'm looking to have discussed by the board, three of those.

687
01:16:33,711 --> 01:16:37,394
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's, I was aware of one waiver, but it looks like there might be a couple of more waivers.

688
01:16:38,455 --> 01:16:39,996
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I'm also requiring plan revisions.

689
01:16:40,797 --> 01:16:47,022
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's about 10 or 11 plan revisions that need to be on a new set of plans.

690
01:16:48,887 --> 01:17:02,753
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's a provision, and this is the subdivision regs, and it's a process protocol issue as far as the Board of Water and Sewer Commission would need to vote an approval on this project as well.

691
01:17:03,594 --> 01:17:12,218
[SPEAKER_11]: And my understanding of that, reading the regs, would be once I approve the plan, or recommend approval with conditions in this case,

692
01:17:12,798 --> 01:17:15,161
[SPEAKER_11]: then it would go to Board of Water and Sewer Commissions.

693
01:17:15,941 --> 01:17:16,782
[SPEAKER_11]: They would need to vote on it.

694
01:17:16,862 --> 01:17:26,612
[SPEAKER_11]: And my understanding of the regs, I think that has to happen actually before the planning board can vote on approval or approve the documents.

695
01:17:26,772 --> 01:17:31,557
[SPEAKER_11]: So, but I am, you know, I feel much better about this project than I did on September 11, 2019.

696
01:17:33,717 --> 01:17:35,539
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that they've come a long way.

697
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:44,086
[SPEAKER_11]: And at this point, I'm headed towards the direction of recommending approval with conditions.

698
01:17:44,747 --> 01:17:48,971
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm in that process now with all this new information compiling those conditions.

699
01:17:49,411 --> 01:17:51,753
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've gone through everything they submitted today.

700
01:17:51,773 --> 01:17:56,317
[SPEAKER_11]: It addresses the vast majority of things.

701
01:17:56,377 --> 01:17:58,399
[SPEAKER_11]: I probably have some clarifying questions here and there.

702
01:18:01,086 --> 01:18:04,367
[SPEAKER_11]: They've come quite a long way in the last few days for sure.

703
01:18:05,668 --> 01:18:05,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

704
01:18:05,968 --> 01:18:10,210
[SPEAKER_14]: And Tim, you said that there were a few things that you wanted board input on in particular.

705
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:11,911
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to mention those right now?

706
01:18:12,631 --> 01:18:13,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I will.

707
01:18:13,251 --> 01:18:13,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

708
01:18:13,471 --> 01:18:15,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me just give me one second.

709
01:18:16,673 --> 01:18:20,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Board opinion on the right-of-way layout adjacent to lot one.

710
01:18:21,355 --> 01:18:24,456
[SPEAKER_11]: It is my belief that is an improvement over the current conditions.

711
01:18:24,856 --> 01:18:32,159
[SPEAKER_11]: However, as Mr. Champy mentioned, there are two grantees associated with that easement, and so they have to sort of be involved in that conversation.

712
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:37,441
[SPEAKER_11]: So, also there was talk about improvements to that right-of-way.

713
01:18:37,461 --> 01:18:41,802
[SPEAKER_11]: I know in various letters, Mr. Champey mentioned, you know, paving it.

714
01:18:42,502 --> 01:18:45,403
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd probably be a good discussion point, probably for a condition.

715
01:18:45,423 --> 01:18:54,065
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there was talk about widening it too, but again, that goes back to the grantees and the fact that it's a 12-foot granted easement.

716
01:18:55,846 --> 01:18:59,787
[SPEAKER_11]: To widen that would have to be some sort of discussion

717
01:19:00,307 --> 01:19:01,369
[SPEAKER_11]: with the grantees.

718
01:19:01,629 --> 01:19:03,431
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not even sure if they would want that.

719
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:06,976
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that comment may have come from the fire department.

720
01:19:08,278 --> 01:19:10,060
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's access to those buildings behind.

721
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:13,144
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, that's fire access to those buildings.

722
01:19:13,164 --> 01:19:14,787
[SPEAKER_11]: So that might need to be fleshed out a little bit.

723
01:19:16,925 --> 01:19:18,727
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, not a showstopper.

724
01:19:18,807 --> 01:19:23,011
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something that could be conditioned if that's pushed.

725
01:19:23,031 --> 01:19:27,535
[SPEAKER_11]: The next one would be comment 5B, board opinion on walking path connection to the high school.

726
01:19:27,555 --> 01:19:29,817
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't have a strong opinion on this.

727
01:19:29,857 --> 01:19:31,498
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that Walk Medford did.

728
01:19:31,518 --> 01:19:32,760
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a good idea.

729
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:39,526
[SPEAKER_11]: And the gist of it is that if a family moves in here and a child is going to the high school, they have to walk all the way around.

730
01:19:40,046 --> 01:19:44,849
[SPEAKER_11]: and then up the high school hill, whereas this project abuts the high school site.

731
01:19:45,189 --> 01:19:50,212
[SPEAKER_11]: So chances are kids are gonna be walking up the hill and through the woods anyway to get to school.

732
01:19:50,812 --> 01:19:56,935
[SPEAKER_11]: So is there an opportunity to sort of flesh out a path of some sort up to the high school?

733
01:19:56,955 --> 01:20:00,077
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was a board opinion that should be discussed.

734
01:20:00,137 --> 01:20:01,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, it's not an engineering thing.

735
01:20:01,958 --> 01:20:04,619
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something that the board should discuss.

736
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:07,841
[SPEAKER_11]: The next one, one second here.

737
01:20:09,836 --> 01:20:13,718
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a small retaining wall, and this is probably more of a site plan type issue.

738
01:20:13,738 --> 01:20:16,039
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a small retaining wall along Winthrop Street.

739
01:20:16,619 --> 01:20:19,301
[SPEAKER_11]: And Ed can correct me, I think it's probably about four or five feet.

740
01:20:19,441 --> 01:20:20,361
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not huge.

741
01:20:20,921 --> 01:20:23,323
[SPEAKER_11]: And that wall, and they did submit a rendering.

742
01:20:25,355 --> 01:20:30,416
[SPEAKER_11]: That wall has a face that is right up against Winthrop Street right-of-way.

743
01:20:30,476 --> 01:20:35,117
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's something that if you're walking by, driving by, it's something that you see and it's going to be in the public view.

744
01:20:35,918 --> 01:20:44,260
[SPEAKER_11]: My concern and the reason I brought it up is because the board probably doesn't want that to be some sort of a large, heavy block wall that looks ugly.

745
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:46,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably wants to be something that looks pretty nice.

746
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:51,782
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got a nice facade on it that the community will enjoy.

747
01:20:54,530 --> 01:21:02,554
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe that was it, those were the opinions that could be discussed by your body.

748
01:21:02,574 --> 01:21:05,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you, Tim.

749
01:21:05,655 --> 01:21:08,096
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome.

750
01:21:08,837 --> 01:21:12,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Klaus, did you wanna jump in, having heard all that?

751
01:21:18,962 --> 01:21:23,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's good to hear from Tim and good to hear that they've come a long way on this.

752
01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:39,533
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'm just sort of wondering, sounds like Tim, you're in the process of putting together a recommendation with some conditions.

753
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:50,322
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know exactly what we're being asked to contemplate today, but I think generally,

754
01:21:52,395 --> 01:21:55,596
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like this project's on the right path, finally.

755
01:21:56,056 --> 01:22:04,118
[SPEAKER_07]: But generally, I think I would want to wait to make any kind of decision until Tim is satisfied.

756
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:06,519
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

757
01:22:06,579 --> 01:22:21,243
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that given the fact that there was a lot of information that arrived just this afternoon, updating and providing data that Tim had been looking for, I don't think there's going to be the opportunity for us to make a definitive decision

758
01:22:22,359 --> 01:22:24,403
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is a public hearing.

759
01:22:33,761 --> 01:22:38,603
[SPEAKER_14]: and also hear from members of the public about what they're thinking about the project.

760
01:22:38,903 --> 01:22:52,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Two things that I would add to what Tim has talked about is I'd like to hear more about the landscaping plan, and I'd like to also hear more about the blasting plan and mitigation of that.

761
01:22:55,751 --> 01:23:03,315
[SPEAKER_07]: I did see a comment somewhere in the submission about, and I know there's some work going on with them,

762
01:23:04,068 --> 01:23:12,651
[SPEAKER_07]: right now that potentially the plans that we were seeing weren't necessarily in line with what was being built right now.

763
01:23:14,571 --> 01:23:18,192
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know exactly how different that may or may not be.

764
01:23:20,533 --> 01:23:28,576
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was, and Tim mentioned this, there was a comment by the fire chief that he liked the right of way to be a little bit wider.

765
01:23:31,895 --> 01:23:44,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I would be interested in understanding maybe from him directly whether, based on the fact that the right of way is legally 12 feet, whether he can live with that dimension.

766
01:23:46,894 --> 01:23:56,338
[SPEAKER_28]: And in addition to that, I would definitely want to hear from the grantees themselves that are behind that, that actually have rights to that.

767
01:23:57,559 --> 01:24:01,780
[SPEAKER_28]: The property behind the project, have they put something in writing?

768
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:07,743
[SPEAKER_28]: How would we know that they're okay with the way the right-of-way is designed?

769
01:24:08,467 --> 01:24:19,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, Mr. Champion, I think you've indicated at one point that you've had conversations with the grantees and that they see this as an improvement.

770
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:21,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there anything in writing you have to that effect?

771
01:24:23,652 --> 01:24:24,432
[SPEAKER_14]: You're muted right now.

772
01:24:24,452 --> 01:24:29,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, Ed, you're muted.

773
01:24:35,975 --> 01:24:36,456
[SPEAKER_31]: There we go.

774
01:24:36,816 --> 01:24:37,696
[SPEAKER_31]: Is that better?

775
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:38,380
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

776
01:24:38,901 --> 01:24:39,541
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, terrific.

777
01:24:41,382 --> 01:24:45,425
[SPEAKER_31]: Shreya is on the call, and I apologize Shreya I can't pronounce your last name.

778
01:24:46,606 --> 01:24:52,230
[SPEAKER_31]: And she's at 553 Winthrop Street, and we've had discussions and I allow her to speak for herself.

779
01:24:52,831 --> 01:24:55,693
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm not sure if the models are on the call which is 555 Winthrop Street.

780
01:24:58,557 --> 01:25:16,070
[SPEAKER_31]: But we, with 555 Winthrop Street, the agreement that we had, and it was, it actually started off in court, and where the waterline for 555 Winthrop Street was traversing across the property.

781
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:19,313
[SPEAKER_31]: This land was registered land, so there's no adverse possession.

782
01:25:20,734 --> 01:25:25,537
[SPEAKER_31]: We wanted Mr. Amato to move the waterline, and he didn't want to.

783
01:25:27,087 --> 01:25:36,723
[SPEAKER_31]: With that, after going to court and prior to getting to any decisions, but there was some documentation when the information was added to the docket.

784
01:25:38,745 --> 01:25:52,212
[SPEAKER_31]: We sat with the prior solicitor and Mr. Amato and his attorney, and we openly discussed that if our project was approved and Mr. Amato supported it, we would replace his waterline for him.

785
01:25:53,693 --> 01:25:56,094
[SPEAKER_31]: We completed that May 29th of this year.

786
01:25:56,534 --> 01:26:02,037
[SPEAKER_31]: So the waterline, the new waterline was run up the right away from Mr. Amato at no cost to him.

787
01:26:02,597 --> 01:26:05,839
[SPEAKER_31]: So although I haven't got it in writing from his attorney yet,

788
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:12,675
[SPEAKER_31]: it would be shocking if that did not come to fruition.

789
01:26:14,137 --> 01:26:23,265
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'll let, I don't know if you can see Shreya on the call, but I saw her earlier.

790
01:26:23,285 --> 01:26:26,408
[SPEAKER_31]: I can't see her.

791
01:26:26,428 --> 01:26:27,569
[SPEAKER_28]: She's still a participant.

792
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:32,093
[SPEAKER_31]: Perhaps we can, I don't want to speak for her.

793
01:26:32,133 --> 01:26:33,594
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd prefer that she spoke for herself.

794
01:26:34,878 --> 01:26:37,019
[SPEAKER_14]: If you unmute her, could you let us know?

795
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:39,161
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

796
01:26:40,501 --> 01:26:41,602
[SPEAKER_20]: Could you repeat her name again?

797
01:26:42,762 --> 01:26:47,605
[SPEAKER_31]: Shreya, S-H-R-E-Y-A, and her last name is spelled B-H-A-T.

798
01:26:47,885 --> 01:26:49,606
[SPEAKER_31]: Don't worry about it.

799
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:50,526
[SPEAKER_00]: I unmuted there.

800
01:26:50,786 --> 01:26:51,087
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

801
01:26:53,765 --> 01:27:02,951
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, we we did speak, um, Ed and I we spoke once today and once like I think maybe like six months ago when we just moved in.

802
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:12,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and um, Ed did mention that, you know, the paving of the road and putting the guardrail and the guardrail is going to be maintained by the HOA.

803
01:27:14,693 --> 01:27:23,398
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as maintenance of the road goes, the right of way, that would be the responsibility of us and 553, right?

804
01:27:23,438 --> 01:27:25,779
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are actually 555 and the motto is 553.

805
01:27:25,879 --> 01:27:29,281
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the opposite.

806
01:27:29,341 --> 01:27:35,064
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we've had that conversation over the phone, but not so much in writing.

807
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:38,085
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know where 553 stands on this.

808
01:27:42,273 --> 01:27:49,879
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is another piece of road that goes, like, kind of wraps around our property, so it goes behind.

809
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:59,727
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, Ed, you said that you were going to give up right away for that, because that belongs to Mr. Connor, and he does not want that paved at all.

810
01:28:00,368 --> 01:28:06,953
[SPEAKER_00]: But if Mr. Connor agrees to it, then you can put in some gravel and stuff to kind of even it out.

811
01:28:07,253 --> 01:28:09,335
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the extent of the conversation we've had.

812
01:28:14,163 --> 01:28:16,324
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, that's very helpful, Tria.

813
01:28:19,626 --> 01:28:34,353
[SPEAKER_14]: Ed, I mean, I think it would be great for us just to be able to, just to make sure all the I's are dotted, T's are crossed, to kind of see all this in writing, make sure that there is a solid agreement there with everybody.

814
01:28:34,373 --> 01:28:35,334
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd be helpful.

815
01:28:36,094 --> 01:28:38,496
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like you're well on your way.

816
01:28:39,896 --> 01:28:41,557
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, I believe we're there.

817
01:28:41,857 --> 01:28:42,738
[SPEAKER_31]: I should say well on our way.

818
01:28:42,778 --> 01:28:43,358
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, I agree.

819
01:28:48,228 --> 01:28:50,390
[SPEAKER_14]: Before I open it up to the other members of the public.

820
01:28:50,430 --> 01:28:57,316
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there any major issues that board members want to want to highlight that they'd like to hear more about.

821
01:28:58,017 --> 01:29:10,668
[SPEAKER_28]: Not so much to hear more Andre my biggest concern that Tim has already brought up is we need new renderings and I believe places already said that this is a whole new project it sounds like and it seems like sounds like there was plan revisions.

822
01:29:11,128 --> 01:29:15,672
[SPEAKER_28]: So before we can even get to the next step, if we can at least see new renderings.

823
01:29:17,673 --> 01:29:19,354
[SPEAKER_14]: of what- Yeah, Mr. Champy.

824
01:29:20,614 --> 01:29:25,176
[SPEAKER_31]: So the only changes to the project have been subterranean.

825
01:29:30,218 --> 01:29:39,142
[SPEAKER_15]: I think perhaps the board would like to see, and perhaps has always wanted to see, what does it actually look like with this

826
01:29:40,248 --> 01:29:42,809
[SPEAKER_15]: 30 or 40 foot wall behind these houses.

827
01:29:43,730 --> 01:29:46,791
[SPEAKER_15]: What does it look like where the property meets another property?

828
01:29:46,851 --> 01:29:57,316
[SPEAKER_15]: We can look at the plans, but to visualize what these very steep grades look like in real life is very difficult.

829
01:29:59,597 --> 01:30:02,658
[SPEAKER_15]: And members of the board, please correct me if I'm misspeaking for you.

830
01:30:02,679 --> 01:30:03,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't intend to.

831
01:30:04,019 --> 01:30:05,360
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Alicia, I think, you know,

832
01:30:06,565 --> 01:30:20,692
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jackie, thank you, and Alicia, thank you, because I'm just remembering now that I had asked for something very much like this the last time we spoke, or the last time we met on this subject.

833
01:30:21,933 --> 01:30:27,575
[SPEAKER_07]: But to me, I think these renderings are nice, but they're artist interpretations.

834
01:30:28,136 --> 01:30:34,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what maybe we're more interested in is some sort of graphic that illustrates

835
01:30:36,942 --> 01:30:45,086
[SPEAKER_07]: the impact that this is going to have on not only this little piece of land, but the area around it.

836
01:30:49,269 --> 01:30:57,834
[SPEAKER_07]: And to me, it seems like an aerial view that shows how everything is laid out, where the neighbors are, how the hill works, that kind of thing.

837
01:30:57,854 --> 01:31:04,338
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, to me, that's the interesting information that we're, I don't think anybody here

838
01:31:05,057 --> 01:31:10,519
[SPEAKER_07]: can visualize and will only really understand when everything is in place.

839
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:29,167
[SPEAKER_14]: But you're suggesting class something along the lines of a 20 foot above the street view looking at the entire subdivision with butters around it.

840
01:31:29,957 --> 01:31:43,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, I think it would be, I'll leave that up to Mr. Champy, but I don't think anybody here truly understands the impact of what is gonna happen here.

841
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:47,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Cuz we drive by that road, that hole every day now.

842
01:31:47,852 --> 01:31:53,156
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think if we took a careful look at the drawings, we'd find that the hole is gonna be two to three times bigger than it already is.

843
01:31:53,236 --> 01:31:55,718
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think anybody's really getting that.

844
01:31:56,719 --> 01:32:00,684
[SPEAKER_07]: getting how this is going to impact the way that area is going to look.

845
01:32:01,845 --> 01:32:07,411
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, you know, and I'm a building professional, so maybe I have a little more ability to see this.

846
01:32:07,811 --> 01:32:12,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to look nice, but I think you have to show us.

847
01:32:12,116 --> 01:32:16,461
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, would it make sense if there's like a

848
01:32:18,105 --> 01:32:28,951
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, a floor plan that extends out to, you know, right and left where the other areas may be impacted and you just pick points of perspective views.

849
01:32:29,071 --> 01:32:42,559
[SPEAKER_21]: So you can see like what the abutting house sees and then, you know, where on the right side, I'm sorry, I'm looking at the mock-up view trying to imagine what's on right and left.

850
01:32:43,299 --> 01:32:45,241
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Christy, the reason that I said,

851
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:55,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, honestly, I think this is on Mr. Champy and the proponent to find a way to illustrate.

852
01:32:56,542 --> 01:33:01,583
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not our job to show him how to show us what he's doing.

853
01:33:02,103 --> 01:33:03,083
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

854
01:33:03,143 --> 01:33:03,924
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I'm just saying.

855
01:33:04,084 --> 01:33:05,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it a plan or is it a diagram?

856
01:33:05,964 --> 01:33:06,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it a section?

857
01:33:08,045 --> 01:33:13,966
[SPEAKER_07]: All these kinds of drawings would help us understand and get a better feeling for what is being proposed here.

858
01:33:18,845 --> 01:33:34,885
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, well, let me open up the public portion of this hearing so that we can hear from some of the neighbors that might be interested in speaking.

859
01:33:36,337 --> 01:33:39,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Annie, can you help me figure out?

860
01:33:39,338 --> 01:33:47,859
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you, again, if you are on the Zoom meeting, you can raise your hand in the participant section.

861
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:51,380
[SPEAKER_14]: There should be a button, and then there's a little hand button.

862
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:57,901
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, there's also the email and the phone number that was read a couple of times earlier in the meeting.

863
01:33:59,141 --> 01:34:01,462
[SPEAKER_20]: Andre, we have Renata Doros who would like to speak.

864
01:34:02,282 --> 01:34:02,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

865
01:34:02,662 --> 01:34:03,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Renata.

866
01:34:05,501 --> 01:34:15,066
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's actually Anthony Duros, Renata's husband, and the resident and owner of 568 Winthrop Street, a bit down the road.

867
01:34:16,766 --> 01:34:23,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for acknowledging, Mr. Chairman, members of the board, Tim for your review.

868
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:27,141
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pleased to see graphics.

869
01:34:28,382 --> 01:34:32,725
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my first time looking at the graphics that have been presented.

870
01:34:32,745 --> 01:34:36,488
[SPEAKER_10]: I've come late to an understanding of this project.

871
01:34:37,889 --> 01:34:46,896
[SPEAKER_10]: I've lived down the street for more than a decade, and what we've seen has been a terraforming, if you will,

872
01:34:47,637 --> 01:34:56,127
[SPEAKER_10]: of what I would call a beautiful landscape prior, reduced to what looks like kind of an abandoned quarry at this stage.

873
01:34:56,868 --> 01:35:04,498
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm pleased to see that something ultimately in terms of betterment will happen to the property, but we do have concerns.

874
01:35:06,672 --> 01:35:22,281
[SPEAKER_10]: As one of the neighboring properties, one of the concerns has to do with stormwater management and the drainage from, as was stated, basically a 10,000 square foot area across the road.

875
01:35:22,981 --> 01:35:29,905
[SPEAKER_10]: So one question, and I'm pleased to see that there's a stormwater infiltration system that is proposed.

876
01:35:30,905 --> 01:35:49,238
[SPEAKER_10]: The first question is whether that system will be connected to the public drainage system, sewer or sanitary for the area, or is it entirely meant to hold its own runoff?

877
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:57,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Doros, do you want to go through all of your questions and points and then maybe they can respond all at once?

878
01:35:57,933 --> 01:36:20,366
[SPEAKER_10]: So the questions will proceed based basically on what the answers are, because if they are to be connected to the public system, then I would want to see the detail for how they're to be connected, an understanding as to whether our existing public infrastructure is gravity-fed versus mechanically driven.

879
01:36:22,628 --> 01:36:36,540
[SPEAKER_10]: The main concern being that should there be substantial runoff during a rainwater event, we don't want to see a surge to the adjacent properties because of the distribution system.

880
01:36:37,501 --> 01:36:39,442
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want flooding in our basements.

881
01:36:40,002 --> 01:36:43,782
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want to see water coming up through the toilets due to a surge.

882
01:36:44,723 --> 01:36:46,943
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a major change to the area.

883
01:36:47,603 --> 01:36:58,506
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm uncertain as to what the capacity is for the stormwater infiltration system that's proposed, even if it is to be divorced from the public infrastructure.

884
01:36:59,286 --> 01:37:13,475
[SPEAKER_10]: The expectation would be that given the grade, you're gonna see stormwater runoff down that main street there, the 12 foot wide roadway at, I believe what was stated as a 7% grade.

885
01:37:15,576 --> 01:37:17,097
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the first concern.

886
01:37:17,117 --> 01:37:21,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Mr. Champion, do you wanna respond to that or have one of your team members do that?

887
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:25,322
[SPEAKER_14]: And then maybe Tim McGivern, if you wanna comment, please feel free.

888
01:37:27,123 --> 01:37:28,224
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.

889
01:37:28,824 --> 01:37:33,288
[SPEAKER_31]: Wayne Kiefner, who's on the call from DCI, designed the stormwater system.

890
01:37:33,308 --> 01:37:34,208
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'll ask Wayne to come.

891
01:37:34,228 --> 01:37:38,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me?

892
01:37:38,912 --> 01:37:39,873
[SPEAKER_14]: And he will unmute him.

893
01:37:39,933 --> 01:37:40,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Just let us know.

894
01:37:41,834 --> 01:37:42,995
[SPEAKER_14]: You should be unmuted now.

895
01:37:43,355 --> 01:37:43,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

896
01:37:43,696 --> 01:37:44,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me OK?

897
01:37:44,757 --> 01:37:44,957
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

898
01:37:45,497 --> 01:37:45,997
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, perfect.

899
01:37:46,038 --> 01:37:49,720
[SPEAKER_05]: So the system is not connected to the municipal system.

900
01:37:50,161 --> 01:37:53,683
[SPEAKER_05]: It is sized, I believe, to hold the entirety of a 100-year storm.

901
01:37:57,141 --> 01:37:58,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know that capacity?

902
01:37:59,722 --> 01:38:01,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Not off the top of my head, I do not.

903
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:12,189
[SPEAKER_05]: There are two catch basins right at the property line of where the new road connects with Winthrop Street.

904
01:38:12,409 --> 01:38:23,815
[SPEAKER_05]: So there'll be no runoff from the new road that goes into Winthrop Street because it's intercepted by those catch basins, which then go to a particle separator for treatment and then into the subsurface system.

905
01:38:27,488 --> 01:38:30,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Quick question about the subsurface system, if you're ready.

906
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:31,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

907
01:38:32,351 --> 01:38:39,115
[SPEAKER_10]: So I heard that it was stated that the ledge or the rock formation does have capacity.

908
01:38:41,136 --> 01:38:42,197
[SPEAKER_10]: What does that mean?

909
01:38:42,217 --> 01:38:46,239
[SPEAKER_10]: So the thought being, we know that there is a groundwater table.

910
01:38:48,341 --> 01:38:51,082
[SPEAKER_10]: There may or may not be fissures within the rock.

911
01:38:51,142 --> 01:38:54,504
[SPEAKER_10]: And is that what you're going to use for some capacity?

912
01:38:54,664 --> 01:38:55,465
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand.

913
01:38:56,851 --> 01:39:02,196
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what was meant by that, and Frank, the geotech, can certainly explain this better than I can.

914
01:39:02,256 --> 01:39:09,382
[SPEAKER_05]: But normally, when we design systems, there's an infiltration rate that is associated with certain soil types.

915
01:39:10,343 --> 01:39:14,767
[SPEAKER_05]: That could range from 1 to, just to use numbers, 1 to 10.

916
01:39:15,627 --> 01:39:21,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say that out here, that number is probably closer to 50, just to give you a sense of scale.

917
01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:29,077
[SPEAKER_05]: in my understanding is there's a large amount of fissures in the ledge that allow that really high infiltration rate.

918
01:39:29,177 --> 01:39:32,079
[SPEAKER_05]: But Frank is better to answer than I can.

919
01:39:34,861 --> 01:39:40,784
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. Chair, and I'm not sure, Annie, if you can see Frank Leathers, is he on the call?

920
01:39:41,224 --> 01:39:42,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I can see him.

921
01:39:43,185 --> 01:39:43,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Annie, do you see him?

922
01:39:45,747 --> 01:39:48,989
[SPEAKER_14]: F. Leathers is the name.

923
01:39:55,296 --> 01:39:56,357
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, this is Frank.

924
01:39:59,519 --> 01:40:17,031
[SPEAKER_27]: The basic design of the system is to provide capacity to temporarily hold and then infiltrate into the ground, in this case into the ledge, the runoff from the street.

925
01:40:18,552 --> 01:40:21,674
[SPEAKER_27]: The testing we did out there,

926
01:40:23,785 --> 01:40:37,733
[SPEAKER_27]: demonstrated that the rock is moderately fractured and has capacity to infiltrate substantial quantities of water.

927
01:40:38,494 --> 01:40:51,441
[SPEAKER_27]: When we did the test, we were basically able, the rock was able to take water as fast as we could put it in.

928
01:40:54,415 --> 01:41:02,338
[SPEAKER_27]: So we are based on the criteria in the Massachusetts stormwater manual.

929
01:41:04,418 --> 01:41:18,783
[SPEAKER_27]: We exceed the minimum requirements substantially and are not expecting there to be any up to the design storm, any

930
01:41:20,419 --> 01:41:30,764
[SPEAKER_27]: overflow, if you will, from the system, that the ground is able to take the flow in accordance with the mass stormwater regulations.

931
01:41:33,846 --> 01:41:46,212
[SPEAKER_10]: The two catch basins that are mentioned at the base of the road, the side street where it meets Winthrop Street, are those to be connected to the stormwater drainage system, which is public?

932
01:41:53,289 --> 01:41:58,373
[SPEAKER_27]: I believe they're connected to this on-site stormwater.

933
01:41:58,973 --> 01:42:04,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so they connect back to behind the house on lot 10?

934
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:07,701
[SPEAKER_27]: I believe so.

935
01:42:08,702 --> 01:42:11,444
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Wayne Keefer is nodding his head yes.

936
01:42:12,085 --> 01:42:12,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

937
01:42:14,959 --> 01:42:23,982
[SPEAKER_10]: elevation of the stormwater infiltration, I'll call it storage, behind the house on lot 10.

938
01:42:25,123 --> 01:42:34,946
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's a high elevation, how is that going to be expected to retain any or capture any water that's introduced at those catch basins?

939
01:42:34,966 --> 01:42:37,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm wondering, is it buried awful deep?

940
01:42:41,949 --> 01:42:42,149
[SPEAKER_27]: Well,

941
01:42:43,697 --> 01:42:44,998
[SPEAKER_27]: This is Frank Leathers again.

942
01:42:46,458 --> 01:43:02,624
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, the bottom of the stormwater infiltration system is above the groundwater level by the minimum amount required by the Massachusetts regulations.

943
01:43:04,345 --> 01:43:11,488
[SPEAKER_27]: And far enough below the level of Winthrop Street and the sidewalk,

944
01:43:13,093 --> 01:43:29,458
[SPEAKER_27]: so that when the water comes down the new road gets to those catch basins, drops into the catch basins, and then flows through an appropriately pitched pipe to the stormwater infiltration system.

945
01:43:29,498 --> 01:43:34,560
[SPEAKER_27]: In other words, the levels all work together.

946
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:38,041
[SPEAKER_27]: That's been part of the design of the system.

947
01:43:38,771 --> 01:43:40,012
[SPEAKER_10]: I see, thank you.

948
01:43:41,112 --> 01:43:45,574
[SPEAKER_10]: The first fellow couldn't answer as to the capacity of that system.

949
01:43:46,214 --> 01:43:47,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know that number?

950
01:43:48,876 --> 01:43:51,957
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know it as I sit here today.

951
01:43:51,977 --> 01:44:07,884
[SPEAKER_27]: I do know that the quantity and the capacity of the system has been designed to meet the Massachusetts stormwater requirements.

952
01:44:09,090 --> 01:44:10,331
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know that number.

953
01:44:11,952 --> 01:44:12,933
[SPEAKER_31]: Excuse me, Mr. Chair.

954
01:44:13,574 --> 01:44:14,434
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, Mr. Chairman.

955
01:44:14,995 --> 01:44:17,817
[SPEAKER_31]: I believe Tim McGivern is looking it up right now.

956
01:44:22,241 --> 01:44:22,821
[SPEAKER_17]: Ed, you're good.

957
01:44:22,881 --> 01:44:23,221
[SPEAKER_17]: I am.

958
01:44:30,127 --> 01:44:30,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, guys.

959
01:44:33,550 --> 01:44:34,270
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got 400.

960
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:35,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

961
01:44:36,032 --> 01:44:36,472
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, no.

962
01:44:37,098 --> 01:44:38,539
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys keep talking.

963
01:44:38,739 --> 01:44:39,860
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll take me a second.

964
01:44:41,021 --> 01:45:05,780
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess the follow-up question would be, are any modifications proposed to the existing area public sanitary or stormwater infrastructure, backflow devices, backflow preventer devices, check valves, other kinds of mechanical protection for the neighbors?

965
01:45:08,779 --> 01:45:25,607
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, so there are none planned because normally if you were going to put a backflow in, from my experience, you would put it at the entrance to a house.

966
01:45:25,647 --> 01:45:37,113
[SPEAKER_31]: So if the sewerage is flowing downhill in the street and we put a backflow preventer in, it would prevent the backflow up the subdivision, but it wouldn't prevent the flow anywhere else.

967
01:45:38,543 --> 01:45:50,631
[SPEAKER_31]: So if a neighbor was concerned about flow coming back up into their house, the backflow preventer would go, usually on a house, it would go internally at the house.

968
01:45:51,271 --> 01:45:51,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, true.

969
01:45:53,173 --> 01:46:04,580
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know if other devices exist to prevent flow, like a check valve, counter what's intended, counter flow to what's intended.

970
01:46:07,973 --> 01:46:16,460
[SPEAKER_31]: I know this is a gravity system and a pressurized system, there would be check valves all over the place, but this is gravity, sir, I don't know.

971
01:46:17,981 --> 01:46:19,162
[SPEAKER_31]: I think Tim is raising his hand.

972
01:46:19,602 --> 01:46:20,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I get an answer.

973
01:46:20,763 --> 01:46:21,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Tim, over to you.

974
01:46:22,465 --> 01:46:24,086
[SPEAKER_11]: It's approximately 4,800 cubic feet.

975
01:46:29,030 --> 01:46:30,150
[SPEAKER_11]: So 40 cubic feet.

976
01:46:30,370 --> 01:46:39,293
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I, and, and some I should mention too is so because this particular system, Tony, uh, is able to take on so much water.

977
01:46:39,313 --> 01:46:43,634
[SPEAKER_11]: And I witnessed the test, uh, the groundwater level stayed level.

978
01:46:43,994 --> 01:46:47,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, the, the ground, the ledge just took, took on water.

979
01:46:48,196 --> 01:46:52,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, the first test that they did, that was about 125 feet away, demonstrated the same thing.

980
01:46:52,457 --> 01:46:54,017
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a little bit more rough around the edges.

981
01:46:54,037 --> 01:46:56,458
[SPEAKER_11]: The, the, it wasn't an ASTM test or anything.

982
01:46:56,798 --> 01:46:58,119
[SPEAKER_11]: the second round of testing was.

983
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:00,562
[SPEAKER_11]: So very high infiltration rates.

984
01:47:01,382 --> 01:47:06,907
[SPEAKER_11]: So that 4,800 cubic feet is probably going to remain empty most of the time.

985
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:15,075
[SPEAKER_11]: And just to mention, so like for example, there's a huge reduction of the volume of water entering the public system.

986
01:47:15,455 --> 01:47:17,876
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just going to pick one storm, the 25-year storm.

987
01:47:18,936 --> 01:47:26,699
[SPEAKER_11]: At the precondition levels, the site before development, 4,988 cubic feet of water entering the system.

988
01:47:27,119 --> 01:47:30,520
[SPEAKER_11]: The proposed development with the systems that they have in place, 2,368 cubic feet.

989
01:47:33,111 --> 01:47:40,856
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're actually reducing the amount of volume of water and amount of water entering the public system than the site today.

990
01:47:42,057 --> 01:47:45,760
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's something that we look for.

991
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:48,001
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's increased, then that's a problem.

992
01:47:48,262 --> 01:47:54,886
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's the same, sometimes that can be seen as a problem, too, especially if there's issues with the public system.

993
01:47:55,527 --> 01:47:58,829
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is seen as a significant improvement.

994
01:47:59,290 --> 01:48:04,863
[SPEAKER_11]: to the existing conditions in regards to stormwater rate and stormwater volume.

995
01:48:06,089 --> 01:48:06,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Tim.

996
01:48:07,010 --> 01:48:08,050
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate that.

997
01:48:08,130 --> 01:48:11,233
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're comfortable with it, then I'm comfortable as well.

998
01:48:11,253 --> 01:48:16,256
[SPEAKER_10]: I have only two things that I'll offer as potential things to look at.

999
01:48:17,137 --> 01:48:26,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Number one, the size of the catch basins and the size of the lines feeding back into that stormwater infiltration unit, and perhaps upgrading those.

1000
01:48:27,805 --> 01:48:28,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Secondly,

1001
01:48:31,184 --> 01:48:55,741
[SPEAKER_10]: If the stormwater infiltration unit does at some point fully charge and it's monitored, so it should be monitored, if it fully charges and then doesn't dissipate as intended into the rock formation, then accommodation should be made for it to be pumped out in future.

1002
01:48:56,581 --> 01:49:04,728
[SPEAKER_10]: So the thought being that should be part of the original design and it probably already is, but I figured I'd, I'd raise it as something to think about.

1003
01:49:04,748 --> 01:49:04,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1004
01:49:06,690 --> 01:49:07,370
[SPEAKER_11]: I come back quickly.

1005
01:49:07,390 --> 01:49:09,372
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a concern I had as well, Tony, early on.

1006
01:49:09,815 --> 01:49:11,756
[SPEAKER_11]: with accessing the system because of the depth.

1007
01:49:12,977 --> 01:49:23,121
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was very concerned about the city taking this on from a maintenance standpoint and doing things like that, like if it gets clogged, pumping it out and providing that maintenance.

1008
01:49:24,142 --> 01:49:26,323
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was a concern.

1009
01:49:26,923 --> 01:49:34,951
[SPEAKER_11]: And since then, it's going to be on a, and I have the document here, a regular maintenance schedule with the HOA.

1010
01:49:35,092 --> 01:49:47,704
[SPEAKER_11]: So, in the conditions, I'm probably going to recommend some sort of annual submission of maintenance logs to the city, something like that, so a record can be kept because it is significant and it is,

1011
01:49:49,666 --> 01:49:53,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Just so you know, too, there is an overflow connected to the city system.

1012
01:49:53,409 --> 01:50:02,534
[SPEAKER_11]: So one of the stormwater standards that has to be met is what happens to water in a catastrophic event, and where does that water go?

1013
01:50:03,315 --> 01:50:07,237
[SPEAKER_11]: So you look at huge amounts of rainfall, and where does that water go?

1014
01:50:08,678 --> 01:50:13,501
[SPEAKER_11]: And to a reasonable extent, if this system were to fill up, it would go into the city system.

1015
01:50:13,741 --> 01:50:16,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Catastrophic event, the city system is probably full already.

1016
01:50:17,064 --> 01:50:19,065
[SPEAKER_11]: and then it starts running down the street.

1017
01:50:19,106 --> 01:50:24,971
[SPEAKER_11]: But we're in a lot of trouble if something like that happens.

1018
01:50:24,991 --> 01:50:27,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Duros, for your comments and questions.

1019
01:50:28,074 --> 01:50:30,536
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there other comments, Annie, that we have?

1020
01:50:30,596 --> 01:50:31,577
[SPEAKER_14]: People have raised their hands.

1021
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:38,643
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I'm going to unmute Peter now.

1022
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:42,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a quick question.

1023
01:50:42,660 --> 01:50:43,901
[SPEAKER_09]: I live on Lorain.

1024
01:50:44,541 --> 01:50:53,205
[SPEAKER_09]: And over the years, I've heard something about an underground water travel way or something that goes between Smith Lane and parts of Lorain.

1025
01:50:53,225 --> 01:50:56,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that still in effect still there?

1026
01:50:57,347 --> 01:51:01,229
[SPEAKER_09]: And how will that be affected if that's still running underneath all these houses?

1027
01:51:02,010 --> 01:51:07,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Will all that stormwater get caught up with that, I guess is my question.

1028
01:51:08,293 --> 01:51:10,934
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter, can I ask you to state your name and address for the record as well?

1029
01:51:11,977 --> 01:51:16,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, my name is Peter, my last name is Moisan, and it's 7 Lorraine Road.

1030
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:23,765
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, I've been hearing about underwater, like underwater travel way in our area.

1031
01:51:24,585 --> 01:51:34,011
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just wondering if that stormwater, if that ever gets into that, well, that starts seeping into my basement or my neighbor's basements or down the line.

1032
01:51:38,214 --> 01:51:41,056
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Champy, you or your team know anything about that?

1033
01:51:41,623 --> 01:51:49,089
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, so so I I have heard that there's there's that there's been some undermining of foundations on Lorraine Road due to due to water.

1034
01:51:49,590 --> 01:51:51,051
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, that's that's.

1035
01:51:52,092 --> 01:52:04,522
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, without being overly critical, it's got more to do with who built the houses than it than it and the water table may have been rising over time, you know, so it could be no one's fault if the water table wasn't there and it's and it's gone up six inches since.

1036
01:52:05,282 --> 01:52:08,545
[SPEAKER_31]: However, um, I don't have the I don't know.

1037
01:52:08,605 --> 01:52:09,246
[SPEAKER_31]: Frank Leathers.

1038
01:52:09,326 --> 01:52:09,906
[SPEAKER_31]: Frank, can you.

1039
01:52:10,927 --> 01:52:15,168
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, I don't think we're not, the water is not flowing across the street from our site.

1040
01:52:15,248 --> 01:52:23,270
[SPEAKER_31]: It's, it's, it's flowing back into the water table and I would, but I really don't know how to answer the question unless Frank or someone has more to add.

1041
01:52:25,070 --> 01:52:26,611
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, this, this is Frank.

1042
01:52:26,671 --> 01:52:26,931
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1043
01:52:27,691 --> 01:52:39,594
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, I'm, I have not heard before of, of so-called, um, underground groundwater flow paths or channels, uh,

1044
01:52:40,486 --> 01:53:09,183
[SPEAKER_27]: in that area, but I think the more important piece of information is that the stormwater infiltration system is intended and designed to intercept the increase in rate of flow coming from the site and to put that into a detention

1045
01:53:10,723 --> 01:53:27,589
[SPEAKER_27]: underground buried detention vault, maybe you would call it, and then infiltrate that into the ground, into the groundwater at a rate that is controlled.

1046
01:53:28,529 --> 01:53:37,492
[SPEAKER_27]: And so I'm not expecting that over time, this development to have any

1047
01:53:38,789 --> 01:53:42,873
[SPEAKER_27]: impact on the groundwater level in the area.

1048
01:53:47,016 --> 01:53:52,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Tim, I don't know if you heard Peter's question or want to comment on it.

1049
01:53:53,261 --> 01:53:53,681
[SPEAKER_11]: I did.

1050
01:53:53,701 --> 01:53:55,222
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm familiar.

1051
01:53:55,242 --> 01:53:56,183
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard things.

1052
01:53:56,663 --> 01:53:58,044
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that there are some records.

1053
01:53:58,064 --> 01:53:59,666
[SPEAKER_11]: The groundwater

1054
01:54:05,818 --> 01:54:17,783
[SPEAKER_11]: level at this site is probably about, I don't know the exact, maybe, I don't know if you guys know, 10, 12 feet below about the road elevation, something like that.

1055
01:54:18,483 --> 01:54:19,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Not exactly.

1056
01:54:19,184 --> 01:54:21,845
[SPEAKER_27]: No, Tim, I think it's a little less than that.

1057
01:54:22,025 --> 01:54:25,086
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it's about seven or eight feet below the road surface.

1058
01:54:27,882 --> 01:54:28,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1059
01:54:28,322 --> 01:54:29,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1060
01:54:29,783 --> 01:54:35,005
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're talking about putting water, there probably will be some sort of groundwater mound after a storm with the system.

1061
01:54:35,365 --> 01:54:40,148
[SPEAKER_11]: That mound is going to dissipate incredibly quickly because of the permeability of the underlying ledge.

1062
01:54:40,708 --> 01:54:45,190
[SPEAKER_11]: So imagine a rainstorm, it rains, it goes into the system.

1063
01:54:45,610 --> 01:54:47,311
[SPEAKER_11]: It is going to create a groundwater mound.

1064
01:54:47,351 --> 01:54:51,533
[SPEAKER_11]: In other words, locally raise the level of the groundwater for a few minutes.

1065
01:54:51,693 --> 01:54:55,995
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know exactly what time it would be, but then that would eventually dissipate and the groundwater level would be back.

1066
01:54:56,555 --> 01:54:59,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Across the street, the groundwater level is going to stay the same.

1067
01:55:00,477 --> 01:55:04,359
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's sort of like adding a glass of water to the ocean.

1068
01:55:05,140 --> 01:55:19,747
[SPEAKER_11]: So the groundwater level is not really going to change across the street based off of my understanding of the system and just general knowledge about the hydrology of this sort of thing.

1069
01:55:21,308 --> 01:55:24,170
[SPEAKER_11]: So I mean, I understand the concerns.

1070
01:55:24,210 --> 01:55:25,291
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard about them before.

1071
01:55:26,012 --> 01:55:29,694
[SPEAKER_11]: I also believe that this project wouldn't exacerbate those.

1072
01:55:30,515 --> 01:55:38,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, for the real reason that they've demonstrated that there's a very high permeability rate of that ledge underneath.

1073
01:55:38,661 --> 01:55:40,542
[SPEAKER_11]: So groundwater is moving pretty quickly through there.

1074
01:55:42,524 --> 01:55:47,067
[SPEAKER_11]: And usually, groundwater flows involve a whole study of their own.

1075
01:55:49,218 --> 01:55:51,120
[SPEAKER_11]: to try to determine what that problem is.

1076
01:55:51,300 --> 01:56:01,027
[SPEAKER_11]: So there wouldn't be any way for anybody at this meeting to know really why that's happening, what the cause of it is, if it's groundwater, without doing a full groundwater study.

1077
01:56:01,688 --> 01:56:05,651
[SPEAKER_11]: And that wouldn't be under the purview of this project or this board.

1078
01:56:05,671 --> 01:56:08,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Tim.

1079
01:56:08,933 --> 01:56:10,794
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1080
01:56:11,035 --> 01:56:12,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Other questions, Annie?

1081
01:56:12,436 --> 01:56:15,098
[SPEAKER_14]: People who have their hand raised?

1082
01:56:15,178 --> 01:56:15,378
[SPEAKER_20]: Len?

1083
01:56:18,072 --> 01:56:21,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, Len, state your name and address, please, for the record.

1084
01:56:22,015 --> 01:56:22,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear me?

1085
01:56:23,276 --> 01:56:23,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we can.

1086
01:56:24,037 --> 01:56:24,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1087
01:56:26,158 --> 01:56:27,259
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Len Levin.

1088
01:56:27,639 --> 01:56:38,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't live anywhere near this development, but I have recently been involved in a development close to where I live, over on Clark Street, dealing with the same kind of issue, which is a water retention system.

1089
01:56:39,368 --> 01:56:44,452
[SPEAKER_06]: And so my question is, in general, to provide my experience and ask is,

1090
01:56:45,345 --> 01:56:47,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So who's responsible for this in the case that it fails?

1091
01:56:49,846 --> 01:56:54,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Is these 10 homeowners gonna eventually be responsible if this thing fails?

1092
01:56:55,207 --> 01:56:58,248
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be designed, I'm an engineer, it can be designed the best it can.

1093
01:56:58,948 --> 01:57:01,729
[SPEAKER_06]: But we know, we know.

1094
01:57:02,409 --> 01:57:04,569
[SPEAKER_06]: So who's responsible for this if it fails?

1095
01:57:09,297 --> 01:57:17,647
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. Chair, in the event that the system fails, it is the homeowners association responsibility to repair it or replace it.

1096
01:57:19,869 --> 01:57:26,257
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. Levine, being an electrical engineer by trade, and I left that career 25 years ago,

1097
01:57:28,514 --> 01:57:39,064
[SPEAKER_31]: The tolerances for the stormwater system and its capacity is substantially larger than the expectation of water flowing through it.

1098
01:57:40,925 --> 01:57:44,228
[SPEAKER_31]: It's not an engineering problem where you have an extra 10% capacity.

1099
01:57:45,209 --> 01:57:51,455
[SPEAKER_31]: The flow rate and the infiltration rates that we witnessed during the tests, they were so fast it was hard to measure.

1100
01:57:53,497 --> 01:57:59,638
[SPEAKER_31]: and using standards that didn't even reach the capacity that we're reaching to do the calculations was the way we came up with it.

1101
01:57:59,678 --> 01:58:00,798
[SPEAKER_31]: So we couldn't even find it.

1102
01:58:01,238 --> 01:58:06,019
[SPEAKER_31]: We were infiltrating faster than any standard that we could use in the calculations.

1103
01:58:06,359 --> 01:58:11,080
[SPEAKER_31]: So you're looking at a system that's got substantially more capacity.

1104
01:58:11,580 --> 01:58:14,261
[SPEAKER_31]: We don't know the limits of it, but we know it far exceeds what we need.

1105
01:58:17,521 --> 01:58:17,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1106
01:58:18,241 --> 01:58:22,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Annie, do we need the street address, Mr. Levine?

1107
01:58:23,096 --> 01:58:23,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Or did you get that?

1108
01:58:28,259 --> 01:58:28,800
[SPEAKER_20]: That would be great.

1109
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:30,641
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me unmute you again, Mr. Libby.

1110
01:58:30,661 --> 01:58:33,323
[SPEAKER_20]: Your street address, please.

1111
01:58:34,003 --> 01:58:36,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I live on Clark Street, which is nowhere near this.

1112
01:58:36,945 --> 01:58:39,286
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, Annie may know who I am.

1113
01:58:39,907 --> 01:58:45,310
[SPEAKER_06]: We dealt with these same kind of issues on a subdivision behind our property, and the same kind of issues.

1114
01:58:45,410 --> 01:58:51,234
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I don't disagree that you can design something as best you can.

1115
01:58:51,274 --> 01:58:52,575
[SPEAKER_06]: All I was asking is that

1116
01:58:54,487 --> 01:58:57,649
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to, as the old saying, you prepare for the worst and hope for the best.

1117
01:58:57,949 --> 01:58:59,770
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can design until the cows come home.

1118
01:59:00,891 --> 01:59:03,112
[SPEAKER_06]: But that doesn't help you when it fails.

1119
01:59:04,513 --> 01:59:08,975
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we know in life, everything has the possibility to fail.

1120
01:59:09,536 --> 01:59:10,096
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's all.

1121
01:59:10,396 --> 01:59:10,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks a lot.

1122
01:59:11,797 --> 01:59:12,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1123
01:59:13,398 --> 01:59:15,919
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Shreya raised her hand.

1124
01:59:15,959 --> 01:59:17,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Andre, we have a few.

1125
01:59:18,101 --> 01:59:18,221
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1126
01:59:18,301 --> 01:59:18,421
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

1127
01:59:18,581 --> 01:59:20,242
[SPEAKER_20]: No, go ahead.

1128
01:59:20,262 --> 01:59:21,583
[SPEAKER_14]: No, why don't you call on them?

1129
01:59:21,603 --> 01:59:22,083
[SPEAKER_14]: That's easier.

1130
01:59:23,738 --> 01:59:24,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that works.

1131
01:59:24,198 --> 01:59:24,678
[SPEAKER_00]: That's perfect.

1132
01:59:25,639 --> 01:59:26,139
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1133
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:30,341
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one last question, and this was regarding the pyrotechnics.

1134
01:59:30,581 --> 01:59:37,944
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe, Mr. Leathers, you mentioned how there are fissures in the bedrock.

1135
01:59:38,445 --> 01:59:45,888
[SPEAKER_00]: So has there been any calculations done to show the rate of propagation of the fissures if you're blasting?

1136
01:59:45,908 --> 01:59:48,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, Ed, you talked about 60 days of blasting.

1137
01:59:50,210 --> 01:59:59,094
[SPEAKER_00]: So how will it accelerate these fissures, and will it propagate to, for example, our bedrock, the ones that were on the hill?

1138
01:59:59,214 --> 02:00:03,016
[SPEAKER_00]: And forgive me, my background is not in construction.

1139
02:00:03,816 --> 02:00:11,920
[SPEAKER_00]: So I might not be using the right terms, but the house is settling from cracks and fissures in the bedrock.

1140
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that be a possibility?

1141
02:00:13,521 --> 02:00:15,361
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, I think, one of our concerns.

1142
02:00:17,863 --> 02:00:18,603
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, first off,

1143
02:00:19,047 --> 02:00:22,509
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, that's a very important and appropriate concern.

1144
02:00:23,509 --> 02:00:40,937
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think it's based on both experience and engineering design that the effect of the blasting would propagate as far as your house or your property.

1145
02:00:43,138 --> 02:01:03,685
[SPEAKER_27]: Basically what we are planning to do is do what we call line drilling, very closely spaced holes along the perimeter of the excavation that was shown in an earlier discussion where that rock wall, rock face excavation is going to be made.

1146
02:01:04,925 --> 02:01:09,707
[SPEAKER_27]: And those closely spaced holes do two things.

1147
02:01:09,847 --> 02:01:12,328
[SPEAKER_27]: They create a more, a smoother,

1148
02:01:13,393 --> 02:01:16,535
[SPEAKER_27]: uh, rock face in the excavation.

1149
02:01:16,555 --> 02:01:31,725
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, but they also tend to, um, intercept the energy from the blasting on the site and, and keep it from propagating, um, outside the site.

1150
02:01:32,526 --> 02:01:41,952
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, typically we space drill holes on the order of, of, uh, five to eight feet.

1151
02:01:42,490 --> 02:01:52,016
[SPEAKER_27]: on center because that's about as far as the blasting is able to impact the rock and break it up.

1152
02:01:54,577 --> 02:02:10,847
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think the distance you are away, there won't be impact on the fracturing in the rock and therefore the potential for settlement or

1153
02:02:11,708 --> 02:02:13,468
[SPEAKER_27]: any other deformation of the rock.

1154
02:02:14,288 --> 02:02:18,449
[SPEAKER_27]: We will be having strict requirements about vibrations.

1155
02:02:18,789 --> 02:02:22,890
[SPEAKER_27]: That's usually the impact on adjacent properties that's of concern.

1156
02:02:24,610 --> 02:02:41,313
[SPEAKER_27]: And there'll be very strict requirements for both controlling the size of the blast and the vibrations that are caused by the blast and requirements for monitoring at adjacent properties.

1157
02:02:41,834 --> 02:02:42,955
[SPEAKER_27]: during the blasting.

1158
02:02:45,297 --> 02:02:45,698
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1159
02:02:49,521 --> 02:02:49,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1160
02:02:49,862 --> 02:02:50,923
[SPEAKER_20]: Annie, do we have others?

1161
02:02:51,183 --> 02:02:58,150
[SPEAKER_20]: We have some comments that have come in via email and phone, so I'm going to turn it over to Ali to read those into the record.

1162
02:02:59,384 --> 02:02:59,604
[SPEAKER_20]: great.

1163
02:02:59,764 --> 02:03:00,024
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

1164
02:03:00,364 --> 02:03:01,224
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Annie.

1165
02:03:01,864 --> 02:03:07,566
[SPEAKER_29]: I'll start with a comment received by phone from Claudia Rocco Budo at two Lorraine Road.

1166
02:03:08,726 --> 02:03:14,407
[SPEAKER_29]: She asked about what traffic calming measures would be initiated for the crosswalk area near this project.

1167
02:03:15,407 --> 02:03:29,070
[SPEAKER_29]: She suggested lights like on high street near the school and her concern being that living on Lorraine Road, she walks a lot and sees that traffic is still very fast, is very fast in this area and so has safety concerns.

1168
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:35,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Champy, do you want to address that issue at all?

1169
02:03:38,763 --> 02:03:39,544
[SPEAKER_14]: You're muted.

1170
02:03:40,604 --> 02:03:41,264
[SPEAKER_31]: My bad, thank you.

1171
02:03:42,045 --> 02:03:44,966
[SPEAKER_31]: Currently, the plan is, you know, the crosswalk.

1172
02:03:45,827 --> 02:03:48,608
[SPEAKER_31]: And there's also, I think there's a bus station right near that.

1173
02:03:48,628 --> 02:03:55,031
[SPEAKER_31]: So, you know, the expectation is that the crosswalk, while waiting at the crosswalk, will give the pedestrian a chance to have traffic see them and stop.

1174
02:03:58,696 --> 02:04:01,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Tim, does the city have any plans in that area?

1175
02:04:03,961 --> 02:04:04,401
[SPEAKER_17]: You're muted.

1176
02:04:08,485 --> 02:04:09,486
[SPEAKER_17]: Tim, you're muted, sorry.

1177
02:04:12,349 --> 02:04:12,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we do.

1178
02:04:13,170 --> 02:04:14,952
[SPEAKER_11]: We're re-striping the whole corridor.

1179
02:04:15,773 --> 02:04:17,735
[SPEAKER_11]: We requested that the project

1180
02:04:19,512 --> 02:04:33,585
[SPEAKER_11]: improve the geometry of this spot, which there are multiple intersections, so Lorraine Road being one of them, obviously, Winthrop Estates, whatever the road ends up being named, then the existing right-of-way.

1181
02:04:34,926 --> 02:04:38,990
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we recommended some changes in geometry.

1182
02:04:39,190 --> 02:04:42,433
[SPEAKER_11]: One was to get that right-of-way off of Winthrop Street.

1183
02:04:43,057 --> 02:05:03,469
[SPEAKER_11]: bring it to the smaller road, the new road, tighten up the radius on Lorain Road, put a stop sign on Lorain Road, and then have a pedestrian crossing from the Lorain Road to the, you know, as you can see on the plan, close to the other side of the road, basically, one of the ones from the states is.

1184
02:05:04,350 --> 02:05:12,115
[SPEAKER_11]: So, but there are other improvements that the city's working on, some sidewalk improvements in this vicinity, and then, like I said, the re-striping,

1185
02:05:13,627 --> 02:05:15,008
[SPEAKER_11]: of the whole Winthrop Street corridor.

1186
02:05:15,588 --> 02:05:24,432
[SPEAKER_11]: So these 10 units didn't warrant further mitigation.

1187
02:05:24,452 --> 02:05:35,797
[SPEAKER_11]: It was really the geometry and the movements of vehicles that we saw as needed some improvements, which is why we asked for those ones.

1188
02:05:38,198 --> 02:05:38,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Tim.

1189
02:05:39,138 --> 02:05:40,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim, can I just follow up on that, Andrew?

1190
02:05:41,620 --> 02:05:42,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, please.

1191
02:05:43,267 --> 02:05:56,066
[SPEAKER_07]: I made a comment before about there was I think I saw something in the report about your report about the new alignment of the road and is that what you just talked about or is it something else?

1192
02:05:56,710 --> 02:05:57,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's one of them.

1193
02:05:57,591 --> 02:06:04,155
[SPEAKER_11]: So the original plan had the road a little bit more askew to Lorraine.

1194
02:06:04,615 --> 02:06:07,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Ideally, you want roads to line up as best you can.

1195
02:06:08,158 --> 02:06:13,661
[SPEAKER_11]: So I figure what the original number was is probably 20 feet, but now it's down to 10 feet, which is acceptable.

1196
02:06:13,781 --> 02:06:19,725
[SPEAKER_11]: So the two center lines lining up, that's within regulation and appropriate.

1197
02:06:21,506 --> 02:06:23,187
[SPEAKER_11]: But the existing condition,

1198
02:06:25,066 --> 02:06:41,843
[SPEAKER_11]: With that right-of-way, which is a terrible turning angle, and then Lorraine, and then if you were to add a new street right there, you're creating a whole host of conflicts just based off of the geometry of the curbing and how vehicles move.

1199
02:06:42,463 --> 02:06:46,347
[SPEAKER_11]: So with the proposal now, it's significantly improved.

1200
02:06:47,528 --> 02:06:51,031
[SPEAKER_11]: So could something be added traffic calming wise?

1201
02:06:51,652 --> 02:07:11,487
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, certainly so the city's always we're always looking at what intersections and what crosswalks warrant some sort of light or some sort of actuator or Right now we're trying to identify crosswalks for Pedestrian warning bollards things like that.

1202
02:07:12,347 --> 02:07:15,590
[SPEAKER_11]: So those aren't in this particular proposal

1203
02:07:16,498 --> 02:07:18,260
[SPEAKER_07]: And can I ask one follow-up on that?

1204
02:07:18,620 --> 02:07:20,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there parking along this stretch?

1205
02:07:20,442 --> 02:07:23,444
[SPEAKER_07]: And we may have talked about this previously, but I forgot.

1206
02:07:25,887 --> 02:07:26,407
[SPEAKER_07]: On Winthrop.

1207
02:07:27,168 --> 02:07:28,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there is.

1208
02:07:28,489 --> 02:07:29,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1209
02:07:30,331 --> 02:07:33,834
[SPEAKER_11]: So there is.

1210
02:07:34,575 --> 02:07:36,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Along this stretch of Winthrop, yeah.

1211
02:07:36,637 --> 02:07:37,177
[SPEAKER_11]: The answer is yes.

1212
02:07:38,939 --> 02:07:41,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it would be incredibly helpful to understand

1213
02:07:42,607 --> 02:08:08,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially with like these cars coming off of this new road like pulling out potentially a Left turn across you know across a lane of traffic on Winthrop understanding like where You know like what the sight lines are for cars, I mean typically this is done by traffic engineers Yeah, there was um

1214
02:08:09,350 --> 02:08:10,530
[SPEAKER_11]: And Ed, you remind me, it's been a while.

1215
02:08:10,771 --> 02:08:18,894
[SPEAKER_11]: The original traffic study did discuss this and we did review it, sight lines and how it was gonna work.

1216
02:08:18,994 --> 02:08:25,976
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was reviewed and we did discuss it and that was- And the traffic study is updated to the latest geometry?

1217
02:08:27,477 --> 02:08:34,059
[SPEAKER_11]: No, because the traffic study is not necessarily concerned with the safety of the movements themselves.

1218
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:38,441
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more the numbers and the impacts with the numbers.

1219
02:08:40,310 --> 02:08:49,934
[SPEAKER_27]: This is this is Frank and I am not a traffic engineer, but I recall that that side of Winthrop street is posted for no parking.

1220
02:08:52,075 --> 02:08:54,656
[SPEAKER_27]: Because whenever we're out there at the site.

1221
02:08:55,777 --> 02:09:00,639
[SPEAKER_27]: We park on the other side of the street on the gas station side of the street.

1222
02:09:01,308 --> 02:09:06,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm trying to confirm that Frank you are right in general parking there it's limited in some spots.

1223
02:09:07,575 --> 02:09:07,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1224
02:09:07,815 --> 02:09:10,499
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to figure out exactly where it is limited.

1225
02:09:11,119 --> 02:09:11,319
[SPEAKER_31]: Right.

1226
02:09:13,622 --> 02:09:17,927
[SPEAKER_31]: Even if it was allowed you'd have a lot of guts to park on that street and get out of your car on that side.

1227
02:09:26,631 --> 02:09:33,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Annie or Allie, are there other comments that you would like to read from the public?

1228
02:09:33,893 --> 02:09:34,953
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, I have a couple.

1229
02:09:35,353 --> 02:09:39,614
[SPEAKER_29]: I have another phone comment from Joe Bruno at 11 Franklin Ave.

1230
02:09:40,394 --> 02:09:51,456
[SPEAKER_29]: And he wanted to know if there was a plan potentially for an exterminator because blasting and digging activity can disturb and stir up rodents.

1231
02:09:52,756 --> 02:09:55,477
[SPEAKER_29]: And so he wanted to know if there was a plan to address that.

1232
02:09:58,005 --> 02:09:58,905
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Mr. Champy.

1233
02:09:59,706 --> 02:10:04,368
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. Chair, members of the board, yes, we have a rodent control plan.

1234
02:10:04,428 --> 02:10:08,631
[SPEAKER_31]: Actually, it's in place now and the traps abated regularly.

1235
02:10:10,912 --> 02:10:11,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1236
02:10:13,725 --> 02:10:16,947
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, I have a couple more that came in from email.

1237
02:10:19,668 --> 02:10:38,858
[SPEAKER_29]: One comment from Jeff Oppenheimer, who is at 29 Wildwood Road, and he wanted to, he said, from what I understand, Waypoint will build a few models, and then it will be up to other individuals to design and build the homes.

1238
02:10:39,378 --> 02:10:42,800
[SPEAKER_29]: Where does the responsibility lie regarding the design of the other homes?

1239
02:10:43,380 --> 02:10:46,901
[SPEAKER_29]: the renderings are just a possibility and not actually how the houses will look.

1240
02:10:49,202 --> 02:10:49,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Mr. Champy.

1241
02:10:50,803 --> 02:10:51,483
[SPEAKER_31]: He is correct.

1242
02:10:56,565 --> 02:11:05,068
[SPEAKER_31]: The zoning will be the zoning itself is what's going to demand.

1243
02:11:05,108 --> 02:11:11,330
[SPEAKER_31]: Now we have, and we've done it in the past, we have some oversight as developers.

1244
02:11:12,698 --> 02:11:21,681
[SPEAKER_31]: But as long as it's architecturally within something that we don't think will hurt the value of the project, we would let a homeowner design their own structure.

1245
02:11:23,762 --> 02:11:27,923
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you going to be designing and building any of them?

1246
02:11:29,049 --> 02:11:37,873
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, we believe we're gonna, you know, I think if we don't build, our expectation is we are at least two, maybe four.

1247
02:11:38,994 --> 02:11:42,836
[SPEAKER_31]: We could build all 10 in one year if the demand is there.

1248
02:11:43,456 --> 02:11:51,660
[SPEAKER_31]: So selling lots is the, we recapture less expenses selling lots.

1249
02:11:51,700 --> 02:11:55,502
[SPEAKER_31]: So we're motivated to actually build the houses and sell them as a complete structure.

1250
02:11:59,228 --> 02:12:00,828
[SPEAKER_31]: it's better for us if we build the houses.

1251
02:12:01,908 --> 02:12:03,148
[SPEAKER_31]: We have some we've had.

1252
02:12:03,168 --> 02:12:04,269
[SPEAKER_31]: We've been asked this.

1253
02:12:04,869 --> 02:12:11,250
[SPEAKER_31]: I think there's like three particular, uh, neighbors who are already asking about which last they can try and buy.

1254
02:12:11,330 --> 02:12:13,190
[SPEAKER_31]: So not not director butters.

1255
02:12:13,391 --> 02:12:16,471
[SPEAKER_31]: Not anybody that's talked today, but it's come up a couple of times.

1256
02:12:19,952 --> 02:12:20,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Tim.

1257
02:12:21,155 --> 02:12:24,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to correct the record, so Frank is right, Ms.

1258
02:12:24,476 --> 02:12:28,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Leathers is right, there's no parking along the stretch that the development is on.

1259
02:12:28,417 --> 02:12:29,597
[SPEAKER_11]: The other side is a little bit unclear.

1260
02:12:30,197 --> 02:12:37,859
[SPEAKER_11]: I think some people probably parked there, but it is not necessarily, there's probably some posted signage up and down the street.

1261
02:12:38,519 --> 02:12:47,161
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that we wanted to restripe the bike lane on the north side of Winthrop Street at some point too, which means no parking there too.

1262
02:12:47,281 --> 02:12:50,082
[SPEAKER_11]: So just to clear the record, go on, thanks.

1263
02:12:54,112 --> 02:12:55,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Allie, is there other comments?

1264
02:12:56,193 --> 02:12:56,453
[SPEAKER_29]: Yep.

1265
02:12:57,093 --> 02:13:02,836
[SPEAKER_29]: I've got a comment from Heather Davidson at 29 Wildwood Road, and she actually has a couple questions.

1266
02:13:02,916 --> 02:13:06,938
[SPEAKER_29]: I guess I can read them all and then let me know if you need me to read others out again.

1267
02:13:06,958 --> 02:13:09,339
[SPEAKER_29]: Her email says,

1268
02:13:10,659 --> 02:13:16,946
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not sure if these are appropriate for this group, but these are the questions we currently have as residents who live very near this development.

1269
02:13:17,727 --> 02:13:21,511
[SPEAKER_29]: One pedestrian safety is already a major concern in this area.

1270
02:13:22,091 --> 02:13:25,214
[SPEAKER_29]: Without the extra traffic from 10 new homes and a new roadway.

1271
02:13:25,955 --> 02:13:34,599
[SPEAKER_29]: Sidewalks with a curb are desperately needed here, and the proposed crosswalk location is in an area where drivers coming from the playstate end are coming out of a curb.

1272
02:13:35,220 --> 02:13:37,161
[SPEAKER_29]: How is the crosswalk location determined?

1273
02:13:37,661 --> 02:13:41,863
[SPEAKER_29]: What else can be done to keep pedestrians safe on both sides of Winthrop Street?

1274
02:13:43,044 --> 02:13:45,085
[SPEAKER_29]: Two, what is the proposed blasting plan?

1275
02:13:46,490 --> 02:13:50,673
[SPEAKER_29]: Three, there are many houses just outside of the 300 foot abutter line.

1276
02:13:51,333 --> 02:13:55,136
[SPEAKER_29]: What can be done to survey and ensure that blasting will not damage those homes?

1277
02:13:55,836 --> 02:13:59,479
[SPEAKER_29]: Can smaller blasts be mandated even if it makes them a bit more frequent?

1278
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:03,862
[SPEAKER_29]: Four, what does the developer propose for the street facing wall?

1279
02:14:03,982 --> 02:14:05,423
[SPEAKER_29]: What is the landscaping approach?

1280
02:14:06,104 --> 02:14:09,546
[SPEAKER_29]: Five, how do the grantees indicate they are okay with this plan?

1281
02:14:10,326 --> 02:14:15,350
[SPEAKER_29]: And six, how will the developer support the care and preservation of the fells in an ongoing way?

1282
02:14:19,706 --> 02:14:20,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Champy, did you get all that?

1283
02:14:21,487 --> 02:14:22,268
[SPEAKER_31]: I did, I did.

1284
02:14:22,568 --> 02:14:22,908
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1285
02:14:23,669 --> 02:14:24,269
[SPEAKER_31]: I think I did.

1286
02:14:27,851 --> 02:14:37,898
[SPEAKER_31]: So I have to be honest, I don't recall how, why the crosswalk, it wasn't me who picked where the crosswalk was.

1287
02:14:37,918 --> 02:14:40,420
[SPEAKER_31]: I think it was near the bus stop.

1288
02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:41,320
[SPEAKER_31]: Tim's raising his hand.

1289
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:42,341
[SPEAKER_31]: He may know better on that.

1290
02:14:42,605 --> 02:14:57,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, I know that in the previous board discussions on this project, we, you know, discussed the alignment and wanted to make sure that Lorain Road was that, you know, the exit to Winthrop Estates was aligned with Lorain Road as much as possible.

1291
02:14:58,125 --> 02:15:00,168
[SPEAKER_14]: So you didn't have multiple intersections.

1292
02:15:02,348 --> 02:15:30,873
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, um And what we've done on our what we what we'd like to do is and it was we did it via the guidance of the dpw the last time When we were we're preparing some work was to set up barriers on the far side of the street with an extra additional pedestrian walkway, which is between lorraine road and um and the gas station and um At that time there was no gravel or asphalt put down for a temporary walking space

1293
02:15:31,603 --> 02:15:40,366
[SPEAKER_31]: So our intent would be to create additional walking space on that side, which I think it'll certainly help in the short term.

1294
02:15:40,386 --> 02:15:51,170
[SPEAKER_31]: And what happens in the long term, I'd have to look at what the plan is when not only do they restripe Winthrop Street, but I'm assuming after the trenching that went on that someone's going to pave it as well.

1295
02:15:51,210 --> 02:15:52,190
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'll leave that to Tim.

1296
02:15:54,842 --> 02:16:16,333
[SPEAKER_31]: Um the the blast and survey what we've been telling neighbors and and um is to we've been putting neighbors on a list Um the last time we did blasting we had a couple of neighbors ask us and we had additional surveys done So if people are concerned we'd ask that they get on the list and we'll survey the additional houses We haven't had anybody ask us to survey a house.

1297
02:16:16,373 --> 02:16:23,537
[SPEAKER_31]: That's a quarter mile away But everything's been reasonable thus far and any reasonable request will certainly take care of um

1298
02:16:24,492 --> 02:16:25,333
[SPEAKER_31]: Smaller blasting.

1299
02:16:25,893 --> 02:16:27,274
[SPEAKER_31]: We've talked to the blasting company.

1300
02:16:27,314 --> 02:16:29,576
[SPEAKER_31]: It's main drilling and blasting, you know, 400 rigs.

1301
02:16:29,596 --> 02:16:32,298
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't know how many employees, you know, five, 600 employees.

1302
02:16:34,495 --> 02:16:37,397
[SPEAKER_31]: And we talked about doing a tighter pattern or a smaller blasting.

1303
02:16:38,117 --> 02:16:43,000
[SPEAKER_31]: Instead of doing one a day, the original plan was 75% of the time we'd have one blast per day.

1304
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:46,922
[SPEAKER_31]: And that after that, and the other 25% would be two blasts per day.

1305
02:16:47,483 --> 02:16:52,345
[SPEAKER_31]: So we're comfortable with having more blasts and having them be smaller.

1306
02:16:54,086 --> 02:16:58,689
[SPEAKER_31]: And with that, we've also talked to neighbors about trying to pick particular times to do the blasting.

1307
02:16:59,629 --> 02:17:03,852
[SPEAKER_31]: Knowing that, for instance, like we're doing a Zoom call right now and I had to beg my kids to be quiet.

1308
02:17:04,683 --> 02:17:27,058
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, I'd imagine the neighbors are going to want us to be blasting a specific time so that You know, um, for instance with with with sharia, you know, she's she's lecturing online and our goal isn't to be blasting while she's in the middle of a lecture uh, so, uh, we'd ask that that um, Whether it's us giving out our information or or or the planning department giving out our information

1309
02:17:28,492 --> 02:17:37,555
[SPEAKER_31]: JJ Lericia, the project architect, excuse me, project engineer in our office will update and send people out.

1310
02:17:37,595 --> 02:17:47,579
[SPEAKER_31]: What we've been doing lately is when we're having, we've been taking out our butters list and sending out flyers through the mail every time we're going to be on site, knowing that everybody's wondering what's going on.

1311
02:17:47,739 --> 02:17:56,402
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'd say the past four or five or six, maybe five or six times that we've been out there, we've given notice and we've offered our email address and phone number.

1312
02:17:57,082 --> 02:18:15,514
[SPEAKER_31]: We've only gotten two people that have gone on the email list Um, so that's why we continue to do their flyers because we don't have that many email addresses as of now We probably have 10 because we had a neighborhood meeting, uh two nights ago And we gathered six or seven more email addresses from that meeting So that's the smaller blast regarding the walls.

1313
02:18:15,834 --> 02:18:21,318
[SPEAKER_31]: Um Yeah, we're on the the wall that tim talked about which is the runs parallel to Winthrop street

1314
02:18:22,365 --> 02:18:24,586
[SPEAKER_31]: you know, our intent is that we want the wall to look good too.

1315
02:18:24,666 --> 02:18:26,647
[SPEAKER_31]: So it's four or five feet high.

1316
02:18:26,787 --> 02:18:32,910
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think using a smaller block makes a lot of sense.

1317
02:18:33,370 --> 02:18:40,253
[SPEAKER_31]: We've used ready rock larger concrete wall block in the past, but we don't think it's appropriate either.

1318
02:18:40,753 --> 02:18:44,175
[SPEAKER_31]: So Michael Radner has a whole list of things from tonight.

1319
02:18:44,355 --> 02:18:50,538
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'm not gonna torture him to, I think he's gonna submit some drawings that will show a lot more architecture.

1320
02:18:51,138 --> 02:18:54,279
[SPEAKER_31]: on the landscaping, and I think that that can be part of it.

1321
02:18:55,799 --> 02:18:58,620
[SPEAKER_31]: With regard to the grantees, we totally agree, as we discussed earlier.

1322
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:03,240
[SPEAKER_31]: The preservation of the fells.

1323
02:19:04,841 --> 02:19:15,303
[SPEAKER_31]: The land to the right of us is 525 Winthrop Street, and our land reaches back up to the fence for the high school fields.

1324
02:19:16,263 --> 02:19:20,444
[SPEAKER_31]: So I don't believe the fells doesn't reach behind us from what I understand.

1325
02:19:23,939 --> 02:19:24,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1326
02:19:28,233 --> 02:19:29,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Ali, do you have other comments or questions?

1327
02:19:31,102 --> 02:19:33,664
[SPEAKER_29]: from the public?

1328
02:19:33,724 --> 02:19:43,670
[SPEAKER_29]: I have a comment submitted by Jayaram Srivallasan, and they are at 1 Lorraine Road.

1329
02:19:43,690 --> 02:19:48,274
[SPEAKER_29]: The comment is, I bought this property about a month ago.

1330
02:19:49,054 --> 02:19:59,341
[SPEAKER_29]: My home was built in the 1930s, and I am concerned for the stability of my home and specifically the impact of blasting on the foundation of my home as well as others in the area.

1331
02:19:59,940 --> 02:20:02,723
[SPEAKER_29]: I'd like to know what plans are in place to mitigate these risks.

1332
02:20:05,985 --> 02:20:09,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and Mr. Champy, one question based on the last comment that I wanted to mention.

1333
02:20:10,089 --> 02:20:19,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want to give an email address right now, since we have over 60 people here, and maybe if they could email you directly, and then you could build your email list?

1334
02:20:19,778 --> 02:20:21,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Might be a good way of doing it.

1335
02:20:21,119 --> 02:20:21,940
[SPEAKER_31]: That sounds great.

1336
02:20:22,340 --> 02:20:25,543
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm going to include JJ's as well.

1337
02:20:27,580 --> 02:20:37,188
[SPEAKER_31]: So my email address is Echampy, that's E-C-H-A-M-P-Y at waypointcompanies.com.

1338
02:20:37,388 --> 02:20:38,048
[SPEAKER_31]: It's one word.

1339
02:20:38,328 --> 02:20:44,413
[SPEAKER_31]: It's W-A-Y-P-O-I-N-T-C-O-M-P-A-N-I-E-S.com.

1340
02:20:46,955 --> 02:20:55,602
[SPEAKER_31]: And JJ's email address is J-L-A-R-I-C-C-I-A at waypointcompanies.com.

1341
02:20:58,393 --> 02:21:00,935
[SPEAKER_31]: And people are welcome to call, too, if they want.

1342
02:21:05,518 --> 02:21:06,339
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

1343
02:21:06,439 --> 02:21:14,925
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, you know, if you want to respond to this recent question about from one Lorraine Road on about the foundation concern.

1344
02:21:15,545 --> 02:21:16,066
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, please.

1345
02:21:16,086 --> 02:21:22,751
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, so I guess you know the early on blasting, which, um.

1346
02:21:23,623 --> 02:21:31,489
[SPEAKER_31]: gave us the ability to do the infiltration testing is probably the closest blasting to their house.

1347
02:21:31,549 --> 02:21:41,156
[SPEAKER_31]: So the good news is that they've been as close as they're gonna get, and I'm assuming they had a home inspection and they bought the home.

1348
02:21:41,716 --> 02:21:45,539
[SPEAKER_31]: So I think that's the proof's in the pudding, so to speak.

1349
02:21:46,360 --> 02:21:47,361
[SPEAKER_31]: And then secondly is,

1350
02:21:48,817 --> 02:21:50,077
[SPEAKER_31]: there will be a pre blast survey.

1351
02:21:50,117 --> 02:21:51,938
[SPEAKER_31]: There's certainly going to be on it where they're located.

1352
02:21:52,778 --> 02:21:56,578
[SPEAKER_31]: And we won't be doing any blasting without the pre blast surveys done.

1353
02:21:56,599 --> 02:22:10,741
[SPEAKER_31]: We were asked by one person at one time, they said, Well, geez, you know, us having to sue you to, to have something fixed, because it gets damaged during the blasting the blasting survey doesn't, they didn't feel it helped that much.

1354
02:22:10,781 --> 02:22:13,562
[SPEAKER_31]: And what I explained was, is the blasting survey is insurance.

1355
02:22:13,822 --> 02:22:14,162
[SPEAKER_31]: It's not

1356
02:22:15,095 --> 02:22:18,499
[SPEAKER_31]: It's not me doing it, it's we're buying insurance and the insurance company is doing it.

1357
02:22:18,639 --> 02:22:23,163
[SPEAKER_31]: So it's third party and they're not gonna have to sue us if there's a damage.

1358
02:22:23,664 --> 02:22:31,912
[SPEAKER_31]: We've never had in the times I've been drilling and blasting, I've only done about seven sites, but we've never had a claim.

1359
02:22:32,253 --> 02:22:37,398
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think that if main drilling and blasting was damaging houses, they wouldn't be able to get the insurance.

1360
02:22:39,813 --> 02:22:49,159
[SPEAKER_14]: I do think it would be great, given all the comments that we've heard, Ed, and I know our own concerns on the board would be to have a written lasting plan that we could review.

1361
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:50,540
[SPEAKER_31]: We do have one, yes.

1362
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:51,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1363
02:22:52,782 --> 02:22:54,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Andre, can I say one more thing?

1364
02:22:54,543 --> 02:22:54,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1365
02:22:55,303 --> 02:22:57,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry to circle back on another comment.

1366
02:22:58,105 --> 02:23:04,989
[SPEAKER_07]: On our project over by Davis Square that we've been reviewing over the past couple of...

1367
02:23:07,893 --> 02:23:30,313
[SPEAKER_07]: think if I'm remembering correctly, we did add a flashing crossing signal to that project, which I'm sort of maybe would like to ask Tim his opinion on that because it feels like it might be a good solution here to do some traffic calming, but would certainly want his opinion.

1368
02:23:31,834 --> 02:23:33,836
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that any crossing that

1369
02:23:35,551 --> 02:23:40,333
[SPEAKER_11]: If the board feels like that should be looked at, I think we can look at that.

1370
02:23:40,433 --> 02:23:46,535
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a traffic folks can take a look to see if it's warranted.

1371
02:23:47,035 --> 02:23:47,936
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be the only thing.

1372
02:23:48,496 --> 02:23:56,319
[SPEAKER_11]: If the board wanted to talk to the proponent about that, then I'd want to make sure that my office looked at it.

1373
02:23:57,159 --> 02:24:00,160
[SPEAKER_11]: It's probably OK, like some sort of like an actuator signal, something like that.

1374
02:24:02,481 --> 02:24:03,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Those don't usually hurt.

1375
02:24:06,840 --> 02:24:15,702
[SPEAKER_14]: If your office could take a look, Tim, at that and see, you know, check out the feasibility and desirability of it and come back to us with a recommendation, that would be great.

1376
02:24:16,682 --> 02:24:16,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1377
02:24:17,142 --> 02:24:17,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1378
02:24:17,302 --> 02:24:22,463
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we didn't originally have anything like that because we were primarily concerned with the geometry of that whole area.

1379
02:24:22,603 --> 02:24:27,424
[SPEAKER_11]: So, but again, I mean, if that's something that the board wants to pursue, I don't see any issues with it.

1380
02:24:27,665 --> 02:24:33,746
[SPEAKER_11]: We would just want to check the box to make sure that we sort of took a look at it and make sure it wasn't going to cause any impacts that we're not thinking about right now.

1381
02:24:34,426 --> 02:24:34,666
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all.

1382
02:24:36,585 --> 02:24:36,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Tim.

1383
02:24:37,445 --> 02:24:37,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

1384
02:24:40,026 --> 02:24:41,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Ali, over to you again.

1385
02:24:41,806 --> 02:24:42,787
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, one more.

1386
02:24:43,107 --> 02:24:47,748
[SPEAKER_29]: This is the last comment that I have right now, but it's got a couple of questions involved as well.

1387
02:24:48,448 --> 02:24:53,870
[SPEAKER_29]: So this is from Robert at 572 Winthrop Street.

1388
02:24:55,170 --> 02:25:02,332
[SPEAKER_29]: And the questions are, one, this development will change the landscape on Winthrop Street and all the surrounding neighbors.

1389
02:25:03,092 --> 02:25:05,353
[SPEAKER_29]: Why should the neighborhood be changed so drastically?

1390
02:25:06,273 --> 02:25:09,334
[SPEAKER_29]: Two, the neighbors are concerned that this development will stick out.

1391
02:25:10,155 --> 02:25:14,476
[SPEAKER_29]: Three, blasting is unacceptable for the neighborhood, 30 to 90 days.

1392
02:25:15,617 --> 02:25:18,098
[SPEAKER_29]: Four, where is the open space in this project?

1393
02:25:18,918 --> 02:25:25,641
[SPEAKER_29]: Five, obviously if they are cramming 10 homes, that means more cars, more traffic, and more taxing on the infrastructure.

1394
02:25:26,761 --> 02:25:28,922
[SPEAKER_29]: Six, is there pest control for the area?

1395
02:25:29,957 --> 02:25:32,479
[SPEAKER_29]: Seven, what is the developer doing for the neighborhood?

1396
02:25:33,260 --> 02:25:35,923
[SPEAKER_29]: Eight, we would like to see a maximum of four homes.

1397
02:25:36,823 --> 02:25:43,770
[SPEAKER_29]: Nine, during the, and this is the final question, number nine, during the last blasting, it did affect my home heating system.

1398
02:25:44,250 --> 02:25:46,032
[SPEAKER_29]: What are they going to do to prevent damage?

1399
02:25:49,135 --> 02:25:54,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, let me just say a couple questions before turning it over to Mr. Champy again.

1400
02:25:55,833 --> 02:26:05,081
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we on the community development board in reviewing subdivision proposals, we are limited by the bounds of state law.

1401
02:26:05,801 --> 02:26:22,815
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, as long as a developer comes in with a proposal that meets the zoning requirements and, you know, all of the kind of safety and infrastructure requirements,

1402
02:26:23,835 --> 02:26:29,017
[SPEAKER_14]: supports for that project, then that's something that we must approve.

1403
02:26:29,417 --> 02:26:40,561
[SPEAKER_14]: So just to keep that in mind, we can't arbitrarily tell them to do four homes instead of 10 homes if the zoning allows 10.

1404
02:26:41,642 --> 02:26:47,484
[SPEAKER_14]: So Mr. Champion, I don't know, maybe that last question is one that is most.

1405
02:26:50,488 --> 02:26:51,229
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, thank you.

1406
02:26:51,389 --> 02:26:52,130
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr Chair.

1407
02:26:52,710 --> 02:26:58,035
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, again on the blasting, um, the pre blast survey and the post, um.

1408
02:26:59,516 --> 02:27:04,821
[SPEAKER_31]: I would say that, you know, Robert has to have gotten a flyer from us once over the past 6 years.

1409
02:27:04,961 --> 02:27:07,604
[SPEAKER_31]: Just call us our phone numbers on our emails on it.

1410
02:27:07,664 --> 02:27:08,044
[SPEAKER_31]: My number is 617.

1411
02:27:08,084 --> 02:27:08,324
[SPEAKER_31]: 2014780 text me.

1412
02:27:08,344 --> 02:27:11,107
[SPEAKER_31]: Call me trying to, you know, within reasonable hours and.

1413
02:27:17,258 --> 02:27:20,181
[SPEAKER_31]: We'll talk to him, we'll come by and we'll help if we can.

1414
02:27:21,622 --> 02:27:30,531
[SPEAKER_31]: We're not so hung up on rules that if he needed a boiler fixed and there was any chance at all that we had something to do with it, we would fix it.

1415
02:27:32,232 --> 02:27:37,698
[SPEAKER_31]: We've been to houses where they blamed us for cracks in foundations and we saw weeds growing out of them.

1416
02:27:37,718 --> 02:27:40,600
[SPEAKER_31]: So there are times when we're asked to look at things that are a little far-fetched, but

1417
02:27:41,342 --> 02:27:45,565
[SPEAKER_31]: In this case, my suggestion, Robert, will you just reach out to us?

1418
02:27:45,625 --> 02:27:46,686
[SPEAKER_31]: We're easily accessible.

1419
02:27:46,806 --> 02:27:51,790
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't think there's any neighbor that's ever tried to contact us that can say that we didn't return their call or email.

1420
02:27:52,331 --> 02:27:56,074
[SPEAKER_31]: So we ask that they just come on over, say hello.

1421
02:27:56,094 --> 02:28:04,100
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so I think that would be, for the person who submitted those questions, I think that would be the first step to go.

1422
02:28:04,260 --> 02:28:09,904
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're not kind of satisfied about the responsiveness, you can always contact the city's

1423
02:28:11,400 --> 02:28:18,685
[SPEAKER_14]: office of community development, and they can help liaise with the developer.

1424
02:28:22,588 --> 02:28:25,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other other members of the public with their hands raised?

1425
02:28:26,931 --> 02:28:27,692
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1426
02:28:27,732 --> 02:28:30,174
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter, I believe, already spoke, so I'm going to go to Lev now.

1427
02:28:36,058 --> 02:28:38,720
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, Mr. Patel, you're unmuted right now.

1428
02:28:40,508 --> 02:28:41,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, everyone.

1429
02:28:41,588 --> 02:28:42,448
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Love Patel.

1430
02:28:42,589 --> 02:28:44,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I live at 536 Winthrop Street.

1431
02:28:45,989 --> 02:28:48,510
[SPEAKER_04]: My main concern is again about the blasting.

1432
02:28:49,890 --> 02:28:52,871
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do want to say like, you know, this is this is a great project.

1433
02:28:52,891 --> 02:28:58,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I would love to see the homes come in and you know, whatever you've done the planning, you've already done it.

1434
02:28:58,832 --> 02:29:01,733
[SPEAKER_04]: You've done your homework, you've made the plots and everything looks great.

1435
02:29:02,633 --> 02:29:08,460
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do want to see it done as soon as possible, just because every time you drive by, it just looks like a big ditch.

1436
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,463
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just, it doesn't look great in the community.

1437
02:29:12,004 --> 02:29:14,366
[SPEAKER_04]: So either way, if you're going to do it, let's get it done.

1438
02:29:14,426 --> 02:29:16,649
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not, let's, you know, put a stop to it.

1439
02:29:17,229 --> 02:29:20,433
[SPEAKER_04]: My biggest concern is with the blasting.

1440
02:29:20,913 --> 02:29:23,756
[SPEAKER_04]: So when the pre blasting did happen, it did affect my house.

1441
02:29:24,958 --> 02:29:32,624
[SPEAKER_04]: It did cause water to come into my house ever since any sort of rain or any storm comes in.

1442
02:29:33,364 --> 02:29:40,991
[SPEAKER_04]: When I did have one of your fellow colleagues, I'm not really sure who it was because I was not home personally, but my parents were.

1443
02:29:41,911 --> 02:29:46,595
[SPEAKER_04]: We did invite them into our house and to have them evaluate it.

1444
02:29:46,855 --> 02:29:52,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, when they did come in, my parents, again, translated for me because I was not there personally.

1445
02:29:53,322 --> 02:29:59,744
[SPEAKER_04]: They came in and they started recording into the house and started saying, there's already a free crack here.

1446
02:30:00,144 --> 02:30:05,986
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a crack there when, you know, when we're looking at it or bear eyes and you can, you're more than welcome to come in.

1447
02:30:06,346 --> 02:30:16,450
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm more than happy to show you where they were recording and saying that there's a crack there when there's no crack to be seen where the water is coming in from the complete opposite side.

1448
02:30:17,130 --> 02:30:18,891
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, I have no problem.

1449
02:30:19,731 --> 02:30:21,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Do your work, but just do it safely.

1450
02:30:21,752 --> 02:30:23,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So no one's affected by it.

1451
02:30:25,591 --> 02:30:25,891
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1452
02:30:26,111 --> 02:30:26,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1453
02:30:26,812 --> 02:30:29,535
[SPEAKER_31]: So you have my reach out to me.

1454
02:30:29,615 --> 02:30:36,601
[SPEAKER_31]: The surveys are done by a third party, so I don't know who the person was that did it, but we'd be happy to come over and take a look.

1455
02:30:37,242 --> 02:30:37,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1456
02:30:37,762 --> 02:30:40,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I have your email as well as your phone number, so I'll reach out.

1457
02:30:41,085 --> 02:30:41,746
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, feel free.

1458
02:30:42,306 --> 02:30:50,634
[SPEAKER_31]: As far as the build soon goes, and this is not touting who or what we are, but our ability to build the project is

1459
02:30:51,699 --> 02:30:54,682
[SPEAKER_31]: is, we absolutely have the ability to build this project.

1460
02:30:55,863 --> 02:31:03,448
[SPEAKER_31]: From a size perspective, it would probably be, it's one of the smallest projects we have on our, on our pipeline.

1461
02:31:04,029 --> 02:31:10,034
[SPEAKER_31]: So, generally buildings that we're building are between 75 and probably between 45 and 100 units.

1462
02:31:11,855 --> 02:31:13,616
[SPEAKER_31]: And I don't see this being a challenge at all.

1463
02:31:15,057 --> 02:31:25,082
[SPEAKER_31]: for getting through the approval process is one process, but the build process for us won't be overly difficult and it won't be a financial strain.

1464
02:31:28,604 --> 02:31:28,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1465
02:31:30,024 --> 02:31:30,805
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, both of you.

1466
02:31:33,806 --> 02:31:34,787
[SPEAKER_17]: Christopher Donovan.

1467
02:31:34,807 --> 02:31:39,909
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, can you hear me?

1468
02:31:40,810 --> 02:31:41,530
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we can, sir.

1469
02:31:43,546 --> 02:31:45,853
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, no, you're just muted yourself, I think.

1470
02:31:47,806 --> 02:31:48,206
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

1471
02:31:48,606 --> 02:31:50,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, my name is Chris Donovan from 4 Lorraine Road.

1472
02:31:51,047 --> 02:32:02,111
[SPEAKER_12]: And just for the board members that are new to the Community Development Board, we were in front of this body last year, and it helped us to lead a charge to push back on this project.

1473
02:32:02,151 --> 02:32:03,112
[SPEAKER_12]: We thought it was too much.

1474
02:32:03,292 --> 02:32:04,872
[SPEAKER_12]: We thought it was a hostile developer.

1475
02:32:05,593 --> 02:32:06,653
[SPEAKER_12]: The plans were too big.

1476
02:32:06,773 --> 02:32:07,973
[SPEAKER_12]: We were concerned.

1477
02:32:08,654 --> 02:32:16,897
[SPEAKER_12]: We haven't seen really good effort from them in the past to do beautification and make our neighborhood look nice.

1478
02:32:17,802 --> 02:32:18,823
[SPEAKER_12]: waiting and waiting.

1479
02:32:19,463 --> 02:32:28,431
[SPEAKER_12]: And only recently with these new plans that come out and an opportunity to speak with Ed directly, we had a little neighborhood meeting and we're ready to push back.

1480
02:32:28,491 --> 02:32:34,956
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a lot of people who are on cable TV and I've spoken to that want to push back and they want to minimize it, they want it stopped.

1481
02:32:35,516 --> 02:32:41,941
[SPEAKER_12]: But speaking with Ed, and we stopped it last year, but stopping it created what we have now, which is the hole in the ground.

1482
02:32:43,394 --> 02:32:52,717
[SPEAKER_12]: So we wanted to push back and and try and get some beautification and turn our neighborhood into what we, you know, we want we want it want to be beautiful and safe.

1483
02:32:53,197 --> 02:33:03,540
[SPEAKER_12]: And you've heard some of those comments and there's a lot of neighbors who asking the same questions because we're nervous, but the meeting that we had with Ed opened up a great communication for the neighborhood.

1484
02:33:04,180 --> 02:33:11,024
[SPEAKER_12]: and we feel like we have communication now and we're going to see new benefits from this.

1485
02:33:12,284 --> 02:33:19,068
[SPEAKER_12]: We didn't like where the original road was, the city pushed back, there's some very intelligent professionals involved now.

1486
02:33:19,748 --> 02:33:24,412
[SPEAKER_12]: looking at the neighborhood issues where we felt unrepresented before.

1487
02:33:25,313 --> 02:33:33,519
[SPEAKER_12]: And this meeting with Ed, it opened up a whole new door for us to have the mediation that we were looking for.

1488
02:33:33,599 --> 02:33:38,643
[SPEAKER_12]: So he was very open to some of the things that I wanted to describe and was told to maybe get it on.

1489
02:33:39,383 --> 02:33:44,707
[SPEAKER_12]: on paper, and Ed, as you can see, just keeps opening himself up for, what can I do?

1490
02:33:45,227 --> 02:33:46,628
[SPEAKER_12]: We haven't really seen that in the past.

1491
02:33:46,728 --> 02:33:50,170
[SPEAKER_12]: It seemed like, again, a hostile developer come in, and we didn't have the communication.

1492
02:33:50,210 --> 02:33:51,111
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't look good.

1493
02:33:51,411 --> 02:33:53,112
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no expectation of what's coming.

1494
02:33:53,552 --> 02:33:56,394
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was deterred in the punch bowl.

1495
02:33:56,434 --> 02:33:57,595
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't want the project.

1496
02:33:57,635 --> 02:33:58,655
[SPEAKER_12]: Neighbors don't want the project.

1497
02:33:58,675 --> 02:33:59,716
[SPEAKER_12]: They're terrified of the

1498
02:34:00,116 --> 02:34:02,418
[SPEAKER_12]: of the blasting, which is still a major issue.

1499
02:34:02,458 --> 02:34:04,659
[SPEAKER_12]: So Frank, we'd love to speak with you more.

1500
02:34:04,699 --> 02:34:09,583
[SPEAKER_12]: But Ed has opened up a communication dialogue that we love, that we love.

1501
02:34:09,663 --> 02:34:10,904
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, people are still concerned.

1502
02:34:10,964 --> 02:34:12,045
[SPEAKER_12]: It's our biggest investment.

1503
02:34:12,125 --> 02:34:13,065
[SPEAKER_12]: It's our sanctuary.

1504
02:34:13,105 --> 02:34:13,806
[SPEAKER_12]: We're conflicted.

1505
02:34:14,406 --> 02:34:15,487
[SPEAKER_12]: Houses are fine now.

1506
02:34:15,547 --> 02:34:16,708
[SPEAKER_12]: What happens afterwards?

1507
02:34:17,208 --> 02:34:18,209
[SPEAKER_12]: City infrastructure.

1508
02:34:18,709 --> 02:34:27,236
[SPEAKER_12]: our own foundations, size and scale, but little by little Ed picked off the different problems that we were addressing.

1509
02:34:27,636 --> 02:34:29,618
[SPEAKER_12]: One of them keeping some of the trucks off Lorraine Road.

1510
02:34:32,704 --> 02:34:37,307
[SPEAKER_12]: maybe off Winthrop Street, because it just causes traffic jams.

1511
02:34:37,327 --> 02:34:46,995
[SPEAKER_12]: The gas station has really created a different environment in this neighborhood in the last year, and it impacts this new project, but they're separate issues, but we need the communication.

1512
02:34:47,555 --> 02:34:53,840
[SPEAKER_12]: And I spoke with Tim McGivern earlier, I spoke to Todd, and it sounds like they're in compliance.

1513
02:34:53,880 --> 02:34:56,802
[SPEAKER_12]: We wanna push back, we don't really want it this big, but it's zoning.

1514
02:34:57,543 --> 02:35:03,709
[SPEAKER_12]: Libertarian they can do what they want on their property, you know, the neighbors want to speak the neighbors want to talk about this.

1515
02:35:04,370 --> 02:35:14,762
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're given this communication with Ed right now sounds like the plans are a little bit more succinct or Tim, you know, looking over for us looking out for us.

1516
02:35:15,582 --> 02:35:16,743
[SPEAKER_12]: We're counting on him.

1517
02:35:16,763 --> 02:35:18,043
[SPEAKER_12]: We're counting on this board.

1518
02:35:18,103 --> 02:35:19,544
[SPEAKER_12]: It may be the last time you deal with it.

1519
02:35:19,944 --> 02:35:20,344
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe not.

1520
02:35:20,364 --> 02:35:21,865
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like it may continue.

1521
02:35:21,905 --> 02:35:25,486
[SPEAKER_12]: But I want to cut to the chase and say, support this project.

1522
02:35:25,686 --> 02:35:28,507
[SPEAKER_12]: I was the one that wanted to squash it.

1523
02:35:28,527 --> 02:35:34,530
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think at this point, the neighborhood, and I can only speak for some or speak for myself, that we want this moving forward.

1524
02:35:34,550 --> 02:35:35,770
[SPEAKER_12]: But we want it done safely.

1525
02:35:36,190 --> 02:35:37,951
[SPEAKER_12]: But we want a new neighborhood.

1526
02:35:38,071 --> 02:35:40,692
[SPEAKER_12]: And so some of the things that Ed and I mentioned, and Ed can

1527
02:35:42,653 --> 02:36:06,368
[SPEAKER_12]: talk about them but the crosswalk is a major major traffic calming a major benefit to this community and it's something that we hope to be on the early side of this project but to create that crosswalk creates a a point that people can focus in on as that's where you you cross there's even a bus stop there may have been moved to the to the Lorraine and gas station side but it was all unkempt I've moated a dozen times

1528
02:36:06,948 --> 02:36:12,433
[SPEAKER_12]: Ed said when he said the crosswalk we talked about extending the sidewalk from Lorraine to Smith Lane.

1529
02:36:12,814 --> 02:36:15,856
[SPEAKER_12]: Chris it's just crushed stone.

1530
02:36:16,617 --> 02:36:24,084
[SPEAKER_12]: We could do that, but does he have to dovetail with Tim and the city and DPW, but it's coming from Ed, it's coming from Ed so

1531
02:36:24,684 --> 02:36:30,589
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll continue but I want to cut a little to the chase where I think in a year from now we're going to have a beautiful neighborhood.

1532
02:36:30,829 --> 02:36:41,759
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we're going to have some beautiful streetscape that's going to come from this project and that's what turned the tide for me to see it completed and to get some benefits to this.

1533
02:36:42,379 --> 02:36:45,602
[SPEAKER_12]: So the sidewalk on Lorain to Smith Lane

1534
02:36:46,162 --> 02:37:03,179
[SPEAKER_12]: With the crosswalk on that side would create a new I see mothers today with it with the baby carriages, and they said that was this would be the one of the biggest changes we've seen in this area on the opposite side between Lorraine and the gas station same thing they mentioned dropping in Jersey barriers for the safety of the blasting on the opposite side so

1535
02:37:03,639 --> 02:37:14,201
[SPEAKER_12]: the Jersey barriers create a walking path on the inside, but no one used that on the inside because the city or someone didn't put crushed stone on the inside, so people walked on the outside, which is even more detrimental.

1536
02:37:14,261 --> 02:37:23,843
[SPEAKER_12]: So if he could clear up those kind of projects in the early stages of this, that is a major benefit to this neighborhood that we haven't seen and begged for for years.

1537
02:37:24,323 --> 02:37:26,844
[SPEAKER_12]: Later on, Eversource is supposed to come down and Tim

1538
02:37:27,344 --> 02:37:33,226
[SPEAKER_12]: And Todd have a larger plan that's all in the works, but it's a little down the line.

1539
02:37:33,266 --> 02:37:47,372
[SPEAKER_12]: But restriping the road, I think that may have said, I don't want to specifically quote, but pushing the line to the winter states side creates more space on this side for the parking that will go from Lorraine to Osborne.

1540
02:37:47,772 --> 02:37:56,705
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's the legal parking from Lorraine to Osborne, and, and a couple of the people you spoke to live on that, and that's a messed up sidewalk you don't know where to sit.

1541
02:37:58,170 --> 02:38:22,740
[SPEAKER_12]: know in in that so um that's will be redefined with with this project as well some divinity on that corner so we thank you know ed for reaching out and saying that so we're also talking about some beautification things like maybe putting up on on the fencing some kind of wrap on there that they see i want to show you a picture just greenscape ed if you could do something like that for the neighborhood versus just a chain link fence and the jersey barrier

1542
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:25,843
[SPEAKER_12]: It makes it look nice when the plans are settled.

1543
02:38:26,403 --> 02:38:30,587
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I first saw the plans of how these buildings would look, I was in love.

1544
02:38:30,888 --> 02:38:32,589
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it looked like a beautiful thing.

1545
02:38:32,629 --> 02:38:37,054
[SPEAKER_12]: They solved the problem of that private right of way to come into this new roadway.

1546
02:38:37,074 --> 02:38:40,517
[SPEAKER_12]: That solved the problem because we have so many roads in that thing.

1547
02:38:40,597 --> 02:38:46,503
[SPEAKER_12]: So this project may clean up some of the issues that this neighborhood has been begging for for a long time.

1548
02:38:47,163 --> 02:38:54,669
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm an advocate for moving forward on this and dovetailing the development with City for that.

1549
02:38:54,769 --> 02:39:09,719
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the short term, we may benefit from Ed's project and being able to use his resources to help the other side of the street in the short term and wait for Eversource to finish theirs and put some beautiful curbing in, bike lanes, striping, that kind of thing.

1550
02:39:10,959 --> 02:39:13,821
[SPEAKER_12]: Ed's project stuff could happen within the next couple of months.

1551
02:39:14,101 --> 02:39:15,462
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope we could do that in the front end.

1552
02:39:15,863 --> 02:39:20,086
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the final stuff, we could wait for a year or two for Eversource to finish.

1553
02:39:20,126 --> 02:39:26,270
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wanna be a proponent of this and thank Ed for reaching out.

1554
02:39:26,351 --> 02:39:38,339
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hope we can do more because as I talk to more people, because I put some things on Facebook and out into the social media world, there's a lot of people that aren't online and they may be listening on public access TV.

1555
02:39:39,803 --> 02:39:43,184
[SPEAKER_12]: But they want to say something and they still want it to have these conversations.

1556
02:39:43,224 --> 02:39:58,010
[SPEAKER_12]: So if Ed you're amenable to another, you know, city meeting because people just want to hear it from the horse's mouth and strangely want to bypass Ed and go to Frank, the geologist, and explain to us again how you have to do that now but Frank, we're putting our faith in you.

1557
02:39:58,590 --> 02:40:00,331
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, strange, but we're putting our faith in you.

1558
02:40:00,371 --> 02:40:09,194
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're the guy who's going to be blasting these rocks, because the rest of it's just construction and there's all details, but the blasting is what concerns everyone for a quarter mile around.

1559
02:40:09,234 --> 02:40:10,214
[SPEAKER_12]: And you don't have to answer now.

1560
02:40:10,234 --> 02:40:21,017
[SPEAKER_12]: You've done something in the past, but Ed, if you could set up a meeting, we'll do another sort of social gathering and try and create some, uh, good, um, uh, feeling good tidying from the neighborhood and push that in.

1561
02:40:21,378 --> 02:40:25,719
[SPEAKER_12]: We're also talking about some kind of beautification, you know, in the area that may extend.

1562
02:40:26,119 --> 02:40:43,634
[SPEAKER_12]: from high school to there and and get some kids involved but ed's open to these ideas including maybe renaming the street to uh identify one of our historic um uh people that lived in that area and we'll release that maybe another time but ed's whatever you want whatever you want it's the first time we hear that we

1563
02:40:44,014 --> 02:40:53,236
[SPEAKER_12]: haven't really seen it in action, but he's given the open door for it, and if we log that today and have that on the books, and Ed, you're amenable to that kind of stuff, I feel good about it.

1564
02:40:53,256 --> 02:40:56,877
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have two or three, you know, minor points, but that's what I want to get out.

1565
02:40:56,897 --> 02:41:00,478
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of people still opposed to it, and they think it should be squashed down.

1566
02:41:00,498 --> 02:41:13,441
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if you could put that genie back in the bottle, but hearing someone say he's done the requirements, it's within zoning, he's followed all the rules, I don't know how much more we can push back with any positive

1567
02:41:15,402 --> 02:41:16,082
[SPEAKER_12]: moving forward.

1568
02:41:17,022 --> 02:41:18,583
[SPEAKER_12]: So I thank you for that.

1569
02:41:18,603 --> 02:41:24,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me see if I have a note.

1570
02:41:24,525 --> 02:41:35,009
[SPEAKER_12]: The yellow line on the other side, Todd is from, I forget Todd's last name, from the traffic study, it has a lot of this mapped out, but it just seems like it's coming down for a while.

1571
02:41:35,330 --> 02:41:37,350
[SPEAKER_12]: The meeting of school time, there may be blasting.

1572
02:41:37,370 --> 02:41:41,072
[SPEAKER_12]: I heard maybe the school only allows blasting within a certain time frame.

1573
02:41:41,652 --> 02:41:44,594
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something to be aware of 9 to 1, but I may be wrong.

1574
02:41:45,074 --> 02:41:51,938
[SPEAKER_12]: So just a couple of notes, but basically, I want to support the project that some people in the neighborhood want to see this move forward and get finished.

1575
02:41:51,958 --> 02:41:53,720
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're looking forward to that.

1576
02:41:53,780 --> 02:42:02,745
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you can sign on to some of those neighborhood beautification projects that we sort of talked about, I think we have a lot of people that are going to love what this looks like in a year from now.

1577
02:42:03,225 --> 02:42:03,766
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

1578
02:42:04,526 --> 02:42:05,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Donovan.

1579
02:42:05,467 --> 02:42:06,527
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate that.

1580
02:42:06,547 --> 02:42:09,629
[SPEAKER_14]: It's good to hear that from your perspective, there's been progress made.

1581
02:42:11,090 --> 02:42:32,735
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do want to clarify for any members of the public who are wondering, our denial of the project in September was based on kind of inadequate data, and we couldn't determine whether there was proper water sewer drainage plans that could support the site.

1582
02:42:34,196 --> 02:42:35,036
[SPEAKER_14]: That has been

1583
02:42:35,676 --> 02:42:40,119
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems that Tim McGivern has reported that there's been a lot of progress on that.

1584
02:42:40,159 --> 02:42:42,480
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems like that has been addressed.

1585
02:42:42,520 --> 02:42:45,542
[SPEAKER_14]: The court has sent the project back to us.

1586
02:42:46,082 --> 02:42:48,684
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's really where things stand right now.

1587
02:42:48,724 --> 02:42:53,667
[SPEAKER_14]: At this point, it's trying to make sure that the project

1588
02:42:55,654 --> 02:43:06,677
[SPEAKER_14]: proponent addresses the neighborhood concerns as best that we can, and then that the design is really as good as we can possibly make it.

1589
02:43:07,237 --> 02:43:18,940
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Chair, if I could add, Ed, is there a possible time that we can do another meeting, but really let it sort of out as, because there's a little history to it, I think if people understood a little of the history and what's coming down

1590
02:43:19,420 --> 02:43:35,126
[SPEAKER_12]: We would get good again, people are angry over it and we're still learning is just so many people that don't do the zoom I don't haven't really had this say, but it looks like we're moving forward with all the logistics but if there's a possibility edge, whether it be from the board here officially or unofficially directly

1591
02:43:35,986 --> 02:43:41,910
[SPEAKER_12]: if we could have another sort of neighborhood meeting that's a kind of a little flowchart of what happened to get people, you know, on board.

1592
02:43:41,930 --> 02:43:47,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I feel like the communication is still, you know, difficult in the city to get, you know, all this information out.

1593
02:43:47,373 --> 02:43:49,454
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a little history that brings us where we are today.

1594
02:43:52,084 --> 02:43:53,105
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Mr. Champion.

1595
02:43:53,445 --> 02:43:56,926
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, Mr. Donovan, you have my I gave my cell number out earlier.

1596
02:43:58,527 --> 02:44:00,248
[SPEAKER_31]: So I mean, I'd be happy to do it.

1597
02:44:00,288 --> 02:44:01,769
[SPEAKER_31]: We did the last one at Victory Park.

1598
02:44:02,189 --> 02:44:09,292
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm happy to, you know, I'll go there with a couple of storyboards and I presented, we can go over the history of the project and where we are.

1599
02:44:11,233 --> 02:44:12,374
[SPEAKER_31]: Related to the other ideas.

1600
02:44:12,394 --> 02:44:14,295
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, and we talked about it two nights ago.

1601
02:44:15,635 --> 02:44:17,977
[SPEAKER_31]: We do community benefits and communities that we don't even work.

1602
02:44:18,037 --> 02:44:18,797
[SPEAKER_31]: So why not do one?

1603
02:44:19,577 --> 02:44:20,818
[SPEAKER_31]: where our project is on the street.

1604
02:44:22,019 --> 02:44:29,584
[SPEAKER_31]: We've contributed to other things in Medford, but it wasn't, we weren't putting it on our website and we don't advertise it in the newspaper.

1605
02:44:30,925 --> 02:44:32,386
[SPEAKER_31]: When we rebuilt the St.

1606
02:44:32,406 --> 02:44:36,809
[SPEAKER_31]: Francis school, the parking lot was an absolute disaster.

1607
02:44:38,510 --> 02:44:45,215
[SPEAKER_31]: And one of the neighbors was at odds with the church because the trash was blowing all over his yard for I don't know how many years.

1608
02:44:46,138 --> 02:44:51,300
[SPEAKER_31]: When we rebuilt the walls around it, which in that case, it is ready walk, but it's a large wall.

1609
02:44:52,900 --> 02:44:59,542
[SPEAKER_31]: The neighbor next door, we finished the site and we finished his driveway because it was affected by the wall.

1610
02:44:59,582 --> 02:45:05,744
[SPEAKER_31]: And we put the wall in his proper spot when the prior wall was four feet on his property, so that he could drive in and out of his property.

1611
02:45:05,764 --> 02:45:07,985
[SPEAKER_31]: And at the end of the project, he had a cookout for all of our guys.

1612
02:45:08,962 --> 02:45:12,044
[SPEAKER_31]: So, this project started off intense.

1613
02:45:13,666 --> 02:45:18,629
[SPEAKER_31]: The negotiation with the planning department on St Francis was intense.

1614
02:45:19,870 --> 02:45:23,593
[SPEAKER_31]: And we own this before we knew that one was going to be intense.

1615
02:45:24,794 --> 02:45:30,318
[SPEAKER_31]: So I have to say that, you know, it's been a great experience over the past seven months.

1616
02:45:32,955 --> 02:45:36,638
[SPEAKER_31]: And I wish we didn't have the track record we had to get this where it is, but I know we can make it right.

1617
02:45:37,019 --> 02:45:41,563
[SPEAKER_12]: But we're not going to put a crown on you until it's finished, but we're looking forward to these changes.

1618
02:45:42,023 --> 02:45:43,345
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't need a crown.

1619
02:45:44,065 --> 02:45:45,006
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm just going to do a good job.

1620
02:45:46,808 --> 02:45:49,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Annie, are there other members of the public who wish to speak?

1621
02:45:50,431 --> 02:45:52,753
[SPEAKER_29]: I have one more comment that just came in by email.

1622
02:45:56,082 --> 02:45:59,845
[SPEAKER_29]: This is from Dennis Carone at 578 Winthrop Street.

1623
02:46:00,105 --> 02:46:05,969
[SPEAKER_29]: He said, I'm writing in to express my deep concern for the negative impact this development will have on our neighborhood.

1624
02:46:06,790 --> 02:46:09,772
[SPEAKER_29]: This is an ongoing embarrassment to the city and should be shut down.

1625
02:46:10,452 --> 02:46:13,614
[SPEAKER_29]: No blasting, no blasting, no blasting, plant trees.

1626
02:46:14,095 --> 02:46:17,317
[SPEAKER_29]: Winthrop Street has suffered enough in recent years, just take a ride by.

1627
02:46:17,337 --> 02:46:21,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1628
02:46:22,763 --> 02:46:25,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Annie, anybody else on the call, the meeting?

1629
02:46:26,011 --> 02:46:29,098
[SPEAKER_20]: Looks like the last one is Peter, who would like to speak again.

1630
02:46:32,805 --> 02:46:35,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, I'm actually speaking for my wife who's not here.

1631
02:46:35,767 --> 02:46:37,028
[SPEAKER_09]: She had some questions.

1632
02:46:37,548 --> 02:46:40,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I'm touching on what Chris said.

1633
02:46:40,971 --> 02:46:42,252
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a hole in the street.

1634
02:46:42,672 --> 02:46:46,375
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd rather see houses and people living in Medford than a hole.

1635
02:46:46,395 --> 02:46:52,379
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't think we're out there to shut you guys down and try to make it so things don't happen.

1636
02:46:52,419 --> 02:46:57,383
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think what we're just looking for is that, you know, we work hard too and we need to make a living.

1637
02:46:57,983 --> 02:46:59,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Just respect our area.

1638
02:47:01,172 --> 02:47:03,953
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, right now, we have a water project going on.

1639
02:47:04,553 --> 02:47:07,113
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a mass mayhem with trucks backing up.

1640
02:47:07,633 --> 02:47:10,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's just a little taste of what could possibly happen.

1641
02:47:10,654 --> 02:47:19,155
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess what I'm just asking is if you guys could just, you know, keep the trucks off Lorraine Road, because we got little kids, we have newborns, we have elderly, we have a big mix.

1642
02:47:19,576 --> 02:47:21,736
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, having big trucks are gonna be a pain in the butt.

1643
02:47:22,216 --> 02:47:25,717
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, we're not out there to say, shut you down.

1644
02:47:26,137 --> 02:47:26,717
[SPEAKER_09]: We invite,

1645
02:47:27,537 --> 02:47:28,817
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, growth.

1646
02:47:29,197 --> 02:47:31,738
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, all it's going to do is make our houses worth more money.

1647
02:47:32,118 --> 02:47:34,358
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to make living in Medford a lot more desirable.

1648
02:47:34,939 --> 02:47:38,139
[SPEAKER_09]: We just want it, if it's going to be done, to be done with respect.

1649
02:47:38,699 --> 02:47:43,860
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's, that's all I guess we're asking for is to respect what we own and respect what we have.

1650
02:47:44,401 --> 02:47:46,661
[SPEAKER_09]: And just, you know, like I said, everyone's going to get something done.

1651
02:47:47,441 --> 02:47:50,002
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

1652
02:47:50,762 --> 02:47:51,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Peter.

1653
02:47:54,179 --> 02:47:59,545
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's go back to the board members for some discussion.

1654
02:47:59,985 --> 02:48:03,549
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that we've seen that there's been a lot of progress made.

1655
02:48:04,610 --> 02:48:10,656
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that we still need to be able to digest the materials that we received today.

1656
02:48:11,096 --> 02:48:14,920
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've identified some areas that we might want a little bit more information on.

1657
02:48:17,220 --> 02:48:28,506
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would be inclined to continue this to our August 20th meeting, where hopefully we can make a final determination.

1658
02:48:30,948 --> 02:48:33,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Champey, does that sound, are you amenable to that?

1659
02:48:35,971 --> 02:48:38,072
[SPEAKER_31]: So, thank you, Mr. Chair.

1660
02:48:41,412 --> 02:48:45,673
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, first off, the call is going great, and we appreciate all the contribution.

1661
02:48:46,774 --> 02:48:54,296
[SPEAKER_31]: Normally, when we would appeal a decision that has a specific group of concerns, we would limit the discussion to the concerns.

1662
02:48:55,677 --> 02:49:04,620
[SPEAKER_31]: In this case, we didn't, because we're eager to hear, and we wanna make changes that benefit us and the neighbors.

1663
02:49:05,020 --> 02:49:06,881
[SPEAKER_31]: So we're open in that respect.

1664
02:49:08,141 --> 02:49:10,062
[SPEAKER_31]: There are a lot of items discussed tonight,

1665
02:49:12,096 --> 02:49:13,297
[SPEAKER_31]: that we're not part of the denial.

1666
02:49:15,280 --> 02:49:18,684
[SPEAKER_31]: And I have a slight concern in that respect.

1667
02:49:20,746 --> 02:49:21,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Understood.

1668
02:49:21,267 --> 02:49:30,538
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that some of these issues, sorry, Alicia.

1669
02:49:31,757 --> 02:49:40,383
[SPEAKER_15]: Andre, I might, cause it sounds like Mr. Champion has some concerns about, pardon me, I'm turning off my video because of my internet connection.

1670
02:49:40,403 --> 02:49:41,724
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can hear me better.

1671
02:49:41,744 --> 02:49:51,570
[SPEAKER_15]: Has some concerns about continuing, but we also have a few legal concerns about having the board vote tonight.

1672
02:49:52,151 --> 02:49:57,134
[SPEAKER_15]: One is that it hasn't gone to our water and sewer commission and that our, um, uh,

1673
02:49:59,246 --> 02:50:06,007
[SPEAKER_15]: ordinances, our subdivision rules and regulations say that it has to go to our water and sewer commission.

1674
02:50:09,088 --> 02:50:12,529
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I believe that my internet may have pulled out on that.

1675
02:50:14,009 --> 02:50:15,049
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we heard you, fine.

1676
02:50:16,470 --> 02:50:17,230
[SPEAKER_15]: Is my internet back?

1677
02:50:17,270 --> 02:50:20,530
[SPEAKER_15]: The other is that they've asked for a waiver.

1678
02:50:20,570 --> 02:50:28,592
[SPEAKER_15]: We got a number of things today from them, including the waiver that we just have to have our legal counsel weigh in on.

1679
02:50:29,343 --> 02:50:36,266
[SPEAKER_15]: in order to make sure that we're handling correctly as part of this.

1680
02:50:36,526 --> 02:50:45,210
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to sort of put that out there that there's both, the board wants to digest things, but we wanna be careful about the legal issues as well.

1681
02:50:48,391 --> 02:50:56,635
[SPEAKER_07]: And Lisa just to reiterate, I very much wanna see the final report from Tim as well.

1682
02:51:01,789 --> 02:51:10,012
[SPEAKER_31]: So regarding the waiver, Mr. Chair, Alicia, there's a waiver for the radius of the curb, is that correct?

1683
02:51:11,293 --> 02:51:11,533
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1684
02:51:11,933 --> 02:51:29,980
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, and then additionally, and this is just for open conversation, the neighbors have expressed concerns of timing and normally when you build a subdivision, you can't put a foundation in the ground until the binder is in place.

1685
02:51:30,962 --> 02:51:37,866
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm not sure if that's something that's granted by the planning board, the building department, the DPW, or whoever.

1686
02:51:38,647 --> 02:51:40,128
[SPEAKER_31]: And if we can't get it, we're fine with it.

1687
02:51:40,568 --> 02:51:42,509
[SPEAKER_31]: But if we can get it, it speeds up.

1688
02:51:43,229 --> 02:51:48,853
[SPEAKER_31]: Because if you go to put a binder in in early December and it's a cold year, you can't put it in until probably April.

1689
02:51:48,893 --> 02:51:52,215
[SPEAKER_31]: So it creates a five-month lag in construction, which

1690
02:51:53,290 --> 02:52:01,199
[SPEAKER_31]: The only reason we requested the waiver for the foundations going in was to eliminate the five-month lag from the neighbor's perspective.

1691
02:52:01,640 --> 02:52:03,862
[SPEAKER_31]: For us personally, we're used to it.

1692
02:52:05,064 --> 02:52:14,134
[SPEAKER_31]: The other waiver was a waiver that was requested by Tim, and us being the proponent, we have to put it in writing and request it.

1693
02:52:15,087 --> 02:52:26,235
[SPEAKER_31]: So it was requested where there was a 30-foot radius for the curbing, cornering going into Winthrop Street Estates, or whatever it ends up being named.

1694
02:52:26,775 --> 02:52:34,961
[SPEAKER_31]: And the request was to reduce it to a 20-foot radius, and Tim can talk better to this than me, which allows handicap ramps to be better.

1695
02:52:36,902 --> 02:52:44,387
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm running out of batteries here, so I'm gonna have to, I'll stop the comment at that and try and move to an outlet that's working.

1696
02:52:45,725 --> 02:53:11,044
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I did actually speak to Tim about the waiver for the narrowed street But I do just want to make sure that we're getting these all of these issues procedurally Correct and because they have shown up some of them showed up as late as noon today that well, I guess some Some of the additional information was we asked for this afternoon.

1697
02:53:11,064 --> 02:53:12,466
[SPEAKER_15]: We received this afternoon.

1698
02:53:12,506 --> 02:53:13,226
[SPEAKER_15]: That was great.

1699
02:53:14,047 --> 02:53:14,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Um

1700
02:53:14,980 --> 02:53:23,202
[SPEAKER_15]: but I just am concerned about us not crossing all the T's and dotting all the I's on this one.

1701
02:53:23,743 --> 02:53:25,163
[SPEAKER_31]: And we don't disagree.

1702
02:53:26,083 --> 02:53:36,286
[SPEAKER_31]: So what I'd like to do is dotting the I's and crossing the T's I'm comfortable with.

1703
02:53:36,706 --> 02:53:42,128
[SPEAKER_31]: Increasing the scope beyond the denial letter, I'd like to discuss further.

1704
02:53:43,347 --> 02:53:52,674
[SPEAKER_15]: So there are a number of things that the board didn't ever weigh in on such as the walls and stuff you presented stuff today verbally.

1705
02:53:52,694 --> 02:53:56,397
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that I might actually go back to the board that they want.

1706
02:53:56,957 --> 02:54:01,041
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nice to hear these things verbally, but the plans need to be correct.

1707
02:54:01,101 --> 02:54:10,488
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of the things that the board has to sign off on in a subdivision is they have to sign the plans and they have to vote on the plans they're going to sign.

1708
02:54:11,521 --> 02:54:23,265
[SPEAKER_15]: and the plans still need some amendment that you've agreed to, but the board can't vote on those plans until they've actually received them.

1709
02:54:23,906 --> 02:54:40,772
[SPEAKER_15]: And my impression, and perhaps we might poll the board and see how they feel, is whether we're asking for a continuance here because we think that this is going to get denied, but rather we think that this is gonna go forward smoothly

1710
02:54:41,640 --> 02:54:48,781
[SPEAKER_15]: but we just can't vote and sign off on these plans until we have the actual final plans in front of us.

1711
02:54:50,642 --> 02:54:56,703
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I just think that there's been some, I think that the progress has been good.

1712
02:54:57,863 --> 02:55:04,785
[SPEAKER_14]: There have just been some loose ends that have been identified and I feel like we, uh,

1713
02:55:06,391 --> 02:55:14,860
[SPEAKER_14]: need to be, I mean, I think the board members, probably many of the board members haven't even had the chance to read the materials that were sent today.

1714
02:55:14,880 --> 02:55:26,212
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just think that in terms of doing our duty, we probably need to be able to finalize this at the August meeting.

1715
02:55:27,282 --> 02:55:30,585
[SPEAKER_31]: So not, not Mr. Chair, not, not agreeing with that.

1716
02:55:30,866 --> 02:55:42,036
[SPEAKER_31]: It's, it's the, so the digesting of the information and the completeness of the plans, Alicia, I guess would, would, will be, it will be a further discussion.

1717
02:55:43,758 --> 02:55:47,762
[SPEAKER_31]: It's for us, we're somewhat sensitive to, to, you know,

1718
02:55:50,656 --> 02:55:53,297
[SPEAKER_31]: And we've worked with legal counsel extensively on this.

1719
02:55:53,957 --> 02:56:02,299
[SPEAKER_31]: So we'll seek the advice of legal counsel on making sure that I'm not doing something on this call that's going to be to the detriment of the company.

1720
02:56:03,239 --> 02:56:13,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there particular issues that you heard tonight that you would be concerned about that go beyond the scope of what you feel you might be willing to do?

1721
02:56:18,202 --> 02:56:23,183
[SPEAKER_31]: I have five pages of notes from the meeting.

1722
02:56:24,424 --> 02:56:32,605
[SPEAKER_31]: When we start discussing the cross sections and understanding the walls, the walls have been in place in this plan for two years now.

1723
02:56:33,446 --> 02:56:39,147
[SPEAKER_31]: So it raises some concern that we're vetting information that we've already vetted.

1724
02:56:41,415 --> 02:56:54,564
[SPEAKER_31]: When we talk about cross sections and, and, and how we discussed the fencing where it is the, the pitch of the soils, the runoff, the drainage, the maintenance.

1725
02:56:55,165 --> 02:57:05,592
[SPEAKER_31]: And I understand that there are new board members, but, you know, it's, it's a concern of ours when a denial letter is written, and then the scope of the denial letter changes.

1726
02:57:07,825 --> 02:57:15,990
[SPEAKER_14]: So from my opinion, what I've heard, I think that we want to see a blasting plan in place.

1727
02:57:16,450 --> 02:57:22,133
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to see the written sign off from the grantees on the right of way.

1728
02:57:22,153 --> 02:57:30,438
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like more detail about the wall that's fronting the street.

1729
02:57:33,219 --> 02:57:34,080
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, you know,

1730
02:57:36,184 --> 02:57:45,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I think there'd be, we wanna just get some advice from and review about the pedestrian issues to see if there's anything that could be done.

1731
02:57:45,628 --> 02:57:51,791
[SPEAKER_14]: And that would be, I agree that's a little, that's a bit of an add on.

1732
02:57:51,971 --> 02:57:55,172
[SPEAKER_14]: So that would have to be a discussion negotiation with you.

1733
02:57:56,113 --> 02:58:03,056
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd like the opportunity at least to think about that and have Tim's office think about it and maybe

1734
02:58:03,471 --> 02:58:04,712
[SPEAKER_14]: talk to you about that.

1735
02:58:05,973 --> 02:58:11,597
[SPEAKER_14]: There's the neighbors have asked for a meeting, which could be done in the next few weeks.

1736
02:58:12,338 --> 02:58:15,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are the things that really I'm focused on.

1737
02:58:17,001 --> 02:58:23,406
[SPEAKER_17]: Do any of the board members think that there are other items that I didn't capture there?

1738
02:58:30,150 --> 02:58:32,351
[SPEAKER_28]: I can definitely see the proponents apprehension.

1739
02:58:33,571 --> 02:58:41,315
[SPEAKER_28]: Andre on this one but one of the things Alicia asked earlier was pretty much pulling the board and see what we thought about this.

1740
02:58:41,755 --> 02:58:49,598
[SPEAKER_28]: I was part of the board previous to the denial, and the information that I've seen so far, and from what I'm hearing from the public.

1741
02:58:50,519 --> 02:58:52,960
[SPEAKER_28]: This project has turned around, I don't see.

1742
02:58:54,100 --> 02:59:16,656
[SPEAKER_28]: uh any reason for um it to be denied in the future, but I mean i'm just i'm We just have to literally follow procedure at this point as alicia has said we don't have the proper renderings We have to make sure that we're doing our due justice for uh due diligence for the for the community and making sure that we are cross dotting all i's and crossing all t's uh, we can pretty much jump the gun here and say that but

1743
02:59:17,336 --> 02:59:20,198
[SPEAKER_28]: And then what will we be at once we did that?

1744
02:59:20,278 --> 02:59:24,001
[SPEAKER_28]: So pretty much this is just all procedural for me.

1745
02:59:24,081 --> 02:59:24,822
[SPEAKER_28]: That's what I see.

1746
02:59:25,923 --> 02:59:37,832
[SPEAKER_28]: Even without having seen the new renderings, I'm guessing that Mr. Champy and the proponent pretty much will do a good job by the community and their neighbors going forward.

1747
02:59:37,872 --> 02:59:41,395
[SPEAKER_28]: But we just want to make sure that that's actually put into place now.

1748
02:59:42,656 --> 02:59:44,577
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, it's all procedural for me at this point.

1749
02:59:44,597 --> 02:59:45,458
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1750
02:59:50,382 --> 03:00:00,867
[SPEAKER_14]: So Mr. Champey, do you think given what I've laid out, does that seem reasonable, a reasonable scope?

1751
03:00:01,427 --> 03:00:03,308
[SPEAKER_31]: It does, and I appreciate the discussion.

1752
03:00:04,989 --> 03:00:19,696
[SPEAKER_31]: The scope seems reasonable, and I think if I had to move because I was running out of batteries and I wasn't able to write, I understood the points you made, but it would be great if we could get a, if we could put, you know, somehow we could draft that as a scope.

1753
03:00:20,347 --> 03:00:20,587
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1754
03:00:20,707 --> 03:00:23,568
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we have a city staff probably have notes on that.

1755
03:00:23,628 --> 03:00:24,948
[SPEAKER_14]: We can, we can put that down.

1756
03:00:24,968 --> 03:00:31,829
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to say just Ali or Annie, can you confirm these items that we've been listing?

1757
03:00:32,029 --> 03:00:36,310
[SPEAKER_15]: We have these together that we could send in an email to the proponent.

1758
03:00:36,330 --> 03:00:42,511
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and on the, yeah.

1759
03:00:42,871 --> 03:00:43,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1760
03:00:43,691 --> 03:00:47,792
[SPEAKER_14]: And so one thing, Ed, I just want to make sure we're clear on this.

1761
03:00:47,832 --> 03:00:49,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause I know this has come from the board and

1762
03:00:50,851 --> 03:00:52,333
[SPEAKER_14]: you express some concern about this.

1763
03:00:52,373 --> 03:01:06,667
[SPEAKER_14]: So the question of, you know, renderings or cross sections, do you think that you could produce the perspective view that the board was looking for?

1764
03:01:06,807 --> 03:01:08,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the board members had asked about.

1765
03:01:09,930 --> 03:01:11,872
[SPEAKER_31]: So I think

1766
03:01:15,185 --> 03:01:16,686
[SPEAKER_31]: I understand what they're asking for.

1767
03:01:17,586 --> 03:01:20,047
[SPEAKER_31]: There's this one is I will take a shot at it.

1768
03:01:21,408 --> 03:01:35,174
[SPEAKER_31]: The it's it's I just don't want it to you know, we did the renderings that we did for for the based on the request that we had over a year ago.

1769
03:01:36,435 --> 03:01:38,696
[SPEAKER_31]: So the renderings were done, they've been presented twice.

1770
03:01:40,116 --> 03:01:41,337
[SPEAKER_31]: And and now we're

1771
03:01:42,614 --> 03:01:46,915
[SPEAKER_31]: We're, you know, 18 months after at $30,000 a month of carry costs.

1772
03:01:47,995 --> 03:01:49,756
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's another month, and it's another rendering.

1773
03:01:50,296 --> 03:01:52,596
[SPEAKER_31]: So it was just, it was disheartening to hear it.

1774
03:01:54,517 --> 03:02:03,879
[SPEAKER_31]: It hasn't changed and in many cases when we do a subdivision, which one of the one of the neighbors stated the, the house designs are somewhat irrelevant.

1775
03:02:05,700 --> 03:02:09,002
[SPEAKER_31]: We're drawing the perspective based on what the zoning allows and what we believe.

1776
03:02:09,622 --> 03:02:17,106
[SPEAKER_31]: But if we were to sell the 10 lots, it would be the beauties in the eyes of the beholder and architects would be driving those 10 houses differently.

1777
03:02:18,807 --> 03:02:26,371
[SPEAKER_31]: So, you know, it was, you know, we're here to try and help and the spirit of the conversation today has been great.

1778
03:02:27,092 --> 03:02:30,614
[SPEAKER_31]: So I tend to bend in those situations.

1779
03:02:32,362 --> 03:02:38,626
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, so we'll, we'll, we'll do our best, but I don't, I don't want it to become a, a rendering exercise.

1780
03:02:40,247 --> 03:02:41,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I make a comment?

1781
03:02:41,908 --> 03:02:42,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1782
03:02:42,148 --> 03:02:42,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, Klaus.

1783
03:02:43,969 --> 03:02:59,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Ed, um, I think when I made my comments about, or at the time that you were showing the renderings, or we were talking about, um, updating the renderings, um, I think my comment was about,

1784
03:03:01,713 --> 03:03:10,840
[SPEAKER_07]: communicating the design that you are suggesting for this site, which I think a lot of people are not quite understanding.

1785
03:03:12,882 --> 03:03:27,113
[SPEAKER_07]: And to that point, if the design of a house is an irrelevant point to communicating what you are going to be doing, then don't include the renderings of the house.

1786
03:03:29,817 --> 03:03:33,340
[SPEAKER_07]: exhibits that are going to help us understand what you're doing.

1787
03:03:34,881 --> 03:03:39,064
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't need an artist to do a watercolor rendering.

1788
03:03:39,144 --> 03:03:45,269
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to, through graphics, understand the scope.

1789
03:03:46,149 --> 03:03:57,418
[SPEAKER_07]: All we have seen are colored pencil sketches over a 3D model and 2D line drawings.

1790
03:03:59,475 --> 03:04:06,339
[SPEAKER_07]: That both those things are on the opposite ends of trying to help us understand what's happening here.

1791
03:04:06,399 --> 03:04:10,721
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about the scale of the project, the size of the walls, and all those things.

1792
03:04:11,241 --> 03:04:20,146
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think what I'm asking for, and I would guess that others would agree, is just a better understanding of what you're trying to put in place.

1793
03:04:20,246 --> 03:04:23,788
[SPEAKER_07]: If it has to be a dotted line around the square that is the building,

1794
03:04:24,496 --> 03:04:30,879
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's an aerial view that shows this is where we are and this is where we're putting walls and this is what it looks like three dimensionally.

1795
03:04:31,539 --> 03:04:42,404
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of what I'm looking for is a better understanding of how this is gonna make this part of Medford, which all these residents have lined up to talk about a better place.

1796
03:04:43,124 --> 03:04:46,125
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's the important thing that you need to illustrate to us.

1797
03:04:47,306 --> 03:04:48,806
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have to be a pretty rendering.

1798
03:04:48,866 --> 03:04:52,348
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be a pretty diagram or it could be a very technical diagram,

1799
03:04:54,057 --> 03:04:56,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Give us that information so we know more.

1800
03:04:56,077 --> 03:05:04,319
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard Mr. Donovan, Christopher, talk about, I want our neighborhood back.

1801
03:05:04,359 --> 03:05:05,840
[SPEAKER_07]: I want it to be a nice place again.

1802
03:05:06,380 --> 03:05:08,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think that's what we're asking to see.

1803
03:05:10,381 --> 03:05:13,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just another colonial house on the street.

1804
03:05:15,702 --> 03:05:16,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Show us how this works.

1805
03:05:18,902 --> 03:05:20,923
[SPEAKER_14]: And one thing we didn't talk about, but

1806
03:05:21,934 --> 03:05:43,148
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe would be helpful to include in something like what Klaas is asking, is just to understand the landscaping a little bit more, like how does that, you know, what is that gonna look like around the envelope, around the project, you know, vis-a-vis the adjacent areas?

1807
03:05:46,730 --> 03:05:48,832
[SPEAKER_31]: I understand the question and,

1808
03:05:50,402 --> 03:05:58,128
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's not, we're not opposed to doing it, but it's the, we'll give it best effort.

1809
03:05:58,828 --> 03:06:01,990
[SPEAKER_31]: We'll draft some information, the cross section of the walls and whatnot.

1810
03:06:02,891 --> 03:06:08,715
[SPEAKER_31]: However, we don't believe that it's a, we don't believe it was part of the denial and we don't believe it's part of the scope.

1811
03:06:09,215 --> 03:06:15,460
[SPEAKER_31]: So we'll do it as a willingness to work together, but we don't believe it should be a hurdle in getting the project approved.

1812
03:06:17,881 --> 03:06:18,522
[SPEAKER_14]: But we will do it.

1813
03:06:19,142 --> 03:06:20,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Understood, thank you.

1814
03:06:24,345 --> 03:06:28,366
[SPEAKER_14]: So is there a motion on the floor to continue?

1815
03:06:30,426 --> 03:06:35,608
[SPEAKER_14]: I should have said, I should have closed the public portion of the hearing earlier.

1816
03:06:35,708 --> 03:06:37,188
[SPEAKER_14]: So let me do that officially now.

1817
03:06:37,948 --> 03:06:43,550
[SPEAKER_14]: And is there a motion on the floor to continue the meeting to August 20th?

1818
03:06:43,590 --> 03:06:48,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Andre, I'll make a motion to continue the meeting to August 20th.

1819
03:06:49,011 --> 03:06:49,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Klaus.

1820
03:06:50,271 --> 03:06:50,911
[SPEAKER_17]: I second that.

1821
03:06:52,232 --> 03:06:52,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Katie.

1822
03:06:54,150 --> 03:06:54,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1823
03:06:56,091 --> 03:06:59,533
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so I got to do a roll call.

1824
03:07:00,694 --> 03:07:01,334
[SPEAKER_14]: David Blumberg?

1825
03:07:01,354 --> 03:07:03,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1826
03:07:05,417 --> 03:07:05,997
[SPEAKER_14]: Christy Dowd?

1827
03:07:06,937 --> 03:07:07,058
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

1828
03:07:08,058 --> 03:07:08,779
[SPEAKER_14]: Les Andresen?

1829
03:07:10,059 --> 03:07:10,179
Aye.

1830
03:07:10,980 --> 03:07:11,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Jackie Furtado?

1831
03:07:12,381 --> 03:07:12,521
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

1832
03:07:13,221 --> 03:07:13,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Katie McHugh?

1833
03:07:14,582 --> 03:07:14,662
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

1834
03:07:17,474 --> 03:07:24,380
[SPEAKER_14]: meeting is continued and we will provide a list of the items that we discussed today.

1835
03:07:24,400 --> 03:07:26,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Oops, sorry, Deanna, you weren't on my screen.

1836
03:07:29,544 --> 03:07:30,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Deanna.

1837
03:07:32,547 --> 03:07:41,414
[SPEAKER_14]: So Ed will provide the notes from the meeting about those items so that you can have some confidence in the scope that we're talking about.

1838
03:07:42,095 --> 03:07:42,815
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1839
03:07:42,835 --> 03:07:43,636
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, members of the board.

1840
03:07:44,144 --> 03:07:44,704
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, thank you.

1841
03:07:44,844 --> 03:07:47,206
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you to the members of the public who participated too.

1842
03:07:47,706 --> 03:07:54,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for all your work.

1843
03:07:54,691 --> 03:07:56,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, everyone.

1844
03:07:57,110 --> 03:08:18,399
[SPEAKER_14]: Next item on the agenda is a continued public hearing on a proposed amendment to chapter 94, zoning section 94-148D, table of use regulations for use 18, multiple dwelling not over three stories in height and use 19, multiple dwelling not over 75 feet or six stories in height to require at least 25% non-residential uses.

1845
03:08:18,439 --> 03:08:18,839
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

1846
03:08:29,905 --> 03:08:38,371
[SPEAKER_14]: So do I, Annie, remind me, do I need to reread the public hearing since this is a continuance, or can we just dive in?

1847
03:08:38,391 --> 03:08:46,476
[SPEAKER_17]: You can reread it to be safe, I think.

1848
03:08:46,996 --> 03:08:47,336
OK.

1849
03:08:55,482 --> 03:08:55,542
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1850
03:08:57,503 --> 03:08:59,705
[SPEAKER_14]: this is the old one, actually, but let's just continue.

1851
03:08:59,745 --> 03:09:00,866
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm reading the original one.

1852
03:09:00,906 --> 03:09:05,870
[SPEAKER_14]: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on Thursday, June 18, 2020 at 6 p.m.

1853
03:09:05,930 --> 03:09:15,098
[SPEAKER_14]: via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to a petition by Mayor Brianna Lungo-Keene to amend chapter 94 zoning section 94-148D table of use regulations for use 18

1854
03:09:18,140 --> 03:09:45,802
[SPEAKER_14]: multiple dwelling not over three stories in height, and use 19, multiple dwelling not over 75 feet or six stories in height, where use 18 or use 19 is presently allowed by right, quote, yes, the proposed amendment would require a special permit from the city council, quote, SPC, requiring that at least 25% of the total gross floor area of the development contain non-residential uses permitted by right, or which are authorized pursuant to a special permit in the underlying zoning district, or where relevant, overlying zoning district.

1855
03:09:46,182 --> 03:09:53,910
[SPEAKER_14]: As drafted, this amendment would take effect in the apartment 1, apartment 2, apartment 3, C1, and MUZ zoning districts.

1856
03:09:54,411 --> 03:10:07,484
[SPEAKER_14]: Full text of the amendment may be viewed in the office of the city clerk or on the city's website at www.medfordma.org slash department slash community hyphen development by clicking on current CD board filings and

1857
03:10:10,044 --> 03:10:19,331
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law, we are conducting this virtually.

1858
03:10:22,513 --> 03:10:22,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1859
03:10:22,873 --> 03:10:32,901
[SPEAKER_14]: So let me invite Alicia Hunt to present, I think, an amended proposal from the administration and to explain it.

1860
03:10:35,322 --> 03:10:35,943
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're muted.

1861
03:10:35,983 --> 03:10:36,683
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

1862
03:10:36,944 --> 03:10:37,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1863
03:10:39,558 --> 03:10:41,579
[SPEAKER_15]: So actually, I'm going to share screen.

1864
03:10:41,599 --> 03:10:50,782
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think I can turn off my video and share screen, because I am trying to not overload the internet in my house.

1865
03:11:00,285 --> 03:11:00,665
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1866
03:11:00,985 --> 03:11:07,067
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you see the Word document, even though I've turned off my video camera?

1867
03:11:09,593 --> 03:11:10,173
[SPEAKER_15]: So you see that?

1868
03:11:11,795 --> 03:11:12,055
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

1869
03:11:12,555 --> 03:11:12,795
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1870
03:11:13,396 --> 03:11:15,197
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, good.

1871
03:11:15,417 --> 03:11:20,861
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is, I've actually used showing this here with track changes.

1872
03:11:22,082 --> 03:11:29,327
[SPEAKER_15]: We've had some discussions with our zoning consultant who is also a zoning planner.

1873
03:11:29,347 --> 03:11:38,474
[SPEAKER_15]: He's a professor at Tufts as well as a zoning lawyer and discuss some of these changes.

1874
03:11:39,867 --> 03:12:01,292
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the things that I heard from the community development board was the concern that 25% would be difficult for developers, because our goal here is not to stop the development of residential buildings, but rather to stop the drain on our commercial district, our commercial spaces.

1875
03:12:01,932 --> 03:12:07,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Some interesting things have arisen as well with various lots being proposed

1876
03:12:08,172 --> 03:12:11,253
[SPEAKER_15]: in apartment two locations and what would the mayor like to see?

1877
03:12:11,293 --> 03:12:12,954
[SPEAKER_15]: What would development like to see there?

1878
03:12:12,974 --> 03:12:20,897
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're like, well, wouldn't it be lovely if there were cafes on the ground floor or stores or dry cleaners and apartments up above?

1879
03:12:21,817 --> 03:12:24,998
[SPEAKER_15]: I did not intentionally stop sharing that.

1880
03:12:26,599 --> 03:12:34,141
[SPEAKER_15]: And then if we had that up above, had apartments and that's not allowed under our current zoning.

1881
03:12:34,462 --> 03:12:34,862
[SPEAKER_15]: So,

1882
03:12:36,361 --> 03:12:39,983
[SPEAKER_15]: That was very odd, but I no longer seem to have the ability.

1883
03:12:40,163 --> 03:12:41,584
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me try and share that again.

1884
03:12:41,604 --> 03:12:45,947
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know why it just stopped sharing, but it's main.

1885
03:12:46,847 --> 03:12:50,449
[SPEAKER_15]: So we changed the 25% to be first floor.

1886
03:12:50,969 --> 03:13:01,175
[SPEAKER_15]: And the reality is in locations where the properties that are up to three stories, the first floor is going to be more than 25%.

1887
03:13:01,215 --> 03:13:02,016
[SPEAKER_15]: And in places where

1888
03:13:05,869 --> 03:13:07,650
[SPEAKER_15]: The height can be up to six stories.

1889
03:13:07,990 --> 03:13:09,591
[SPEAKER_15]: The first floor is gonna be a lot less than 25%.

1890
03:13:09,751 --> 03:13:33,988
[SPEAKER_15]: So it'll be a bit of a give and take, but the wording is at least the first floor contain non-residential uses permitted by right, which are authorized pursuant to a special permit in the underlying zoning district or where relevant overlying zoning district or business or professional office, retail sales,

1891
03:13:34,506 --> 03:13:41,288
[SPEAKER_15]: consumer service business or eating place as defined in section 94-2 definitions.

1892
03:13:42,308 --> 03:13:55,431
[SPEAKER_15]: And consumer service business, eating place are both defined in our definitions.

1893
03:13:56,051 --> 03:14:00,272
[SPEAKER_15]: And I believe retails is as well, but now I'm gonna have to double check.

1894
03:14:01,728 --> 03:14:06,292
[SPEAKER_15]: Consumer service business seems like a weird phrasing that was not chosen arbitrarily.

1895
03:14:06,413 --> 03:14:11,437
[SPEAKER_15]: That is in fact lifted directly from our definitions in our zoning section.

1896
03:14:11,797 --> 03:14:15,501
[SPEAKER_15]: So the intention here would be to be saying that these items are allowed.

1897
03:14:16,001 --> 03:14:26,511
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of the items that, one of the issues that was brought up at the prior hearing was that in apartment one and two districts,

1898
03:14:27,627 --> 03:14:30,268
[SPEAKER_15]: None of these uses are currently allowed.

1899
03:14:30,908 --> 03:14:42,212
[SPEAKER_15]: Therefore, if you are requiring non-residential use on the first floor, but you didn't allow any of these uses, you are essentially stopping residential development.

1900
03:14:42,873 --> 03:14:44,793
[SPEAKER_15]: And that is not what the intention was.

1901
03:14:44,873 --> 03:14:51,456
[SPEAKER_15]: The intention is to have these commercial, these cafes on the first floor.

1902
03:14:52,496 --> 03:14:54,577
[SPEAKER_15]: We did want it to be flexible enough

1903
03:14:55,218 --> 03:15:04,661
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's a lot of feeling that there's business professional office, that there's too many dental offices and doctor's offices on the first floor and that's not the greatest.

1904
03:15:05,922 --> 03:15:17,426
[SPEAKER_15]: But we do realize that we need to be flexible about what would be allowed there because the bottom line is that we'd like to have commercial as part of these.

1905
03:15:18,266 --> 03:15:23,028
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have to have something that is gonna be developable.

1906
03:15:24,086 --> 03:15:25,487
[SPEAKER_15]: in this time.

1907
03:15:26,107 --> 03:15:27,707
[SPEAKER_15]: So this was our proposal.

1908
03:15:28,568 --> 03:15:38,951
[SPEAKER_15]: And the very first question that I had, that Annie had, that the mayor had is, is this a substantial change and would this require being re-advertised?

1909
03:15:39,591 --> 03:15:43,212
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we actually asked our lawyer to weigh in on that.

1910
03:15:43,872 --> 03:15:52,055
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I've also provided a memo to the board that is quite extensive, that it explains, no, this is not

1911
03:15:53,048 --> 03:16:03,192
[SPEAKER_15]: legally considered a substantial change, and no, this does not need to be re-advertised for the scope of these changes that we're putting forward here tonight.

1912
03:16:03,812 --> 03:16:04,652
[SPEAKER_15]: I can share that.

1913
03:16:04,712 --> 03:16:08,533
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe that that was all sent to the members.

1914
03:16:09,654 --> 03:16:13,535
[SPEAKER_15]: We could share that as well, but frankly, it's quite long to say that.

1915
03:16:13,635 --> 03:16:15,616
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not to say.

1916
03:16:16,016 --> 03:16:18,837
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll leave it there and see if there are any questions.

1917
03:16:18,877 --> 03:16:21,278
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me know at what point you want me to stop sharing this.

1918
03:16:24,953 --> 03:16:26,473
[SPEAKER_17]: And thank you, Alicia.

1919
03:16:27,153 --> 03:16:27,934
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Klaus.

1920
03:16:29,674 --> 03:16:45,878
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Alicia, it seems to me in reading this that someone could build like a 10 foot by 10 foot box and say there's a forest in there and that's it.

1921
03:16:48,858 --> 03:16:49,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that right?

1922
03:16:49,398 --> 03:16:52,199
[SPEAKER_07]: There doesn't seem to be any sort of

1923
03:16:53,490 --> 03:17:09,118
[SPEAKER_15]: space as Pedestal ding So no and in fact it is something that would be special permit by City Council every one of these so that was something that we discussed with our legal counsel and

1924
03:17:11,990 --> 03:17:24,374
[SPEAKER_15]: The idea of it being special permit by through city council means that they couldn't do something like that unless the city council looked at it and said, Oh yeah, that's a good idea.

1925
03:17:24,994 --> 03:17:29,356
[SPEAKER_15]: And we want to permit that it would give them the ability to say,

1926
03:17:30,563 --> 03:17:32,603
[SPEAKER_15]: it has to be the full footprint of the building.

1927
03:17:32,623 --> 03:17:44,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the other thing that I asked is could this be interpreted to mean subgrade parking would be the first floor and non-residential or first floor parking.

1928
03:17:44,986 --> 03:17:53,767
[SPEAKER_15]: And what our legal counsel said was that that would be basically something that the city council could look at and say, we don't like it.

1929
03:17:54,207 --> 03:17:57,288
[SPEAKER_15]: So no, they can't do that, that they would have discretion.

1930
03:18:00,341 --> 03:18:00,801
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1931
03:18:05,344 --> 03:18:06,225
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems tricky.

1932
03:18:08,466 --> 03:18:23,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, having developed these kinds of, a lot of these kinds of buildings, you know, there's all kinds of requirements on the ground floor beyond residential.

1933
03:18:26,017 --> 03:18:28,259
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you need a lobby, you need

1934
03:18:30,354 --> 03:18:33,276
[SPEAKER_07]: ancillary uses, you need utilities, like all that stuff.

1935
03:18:33,376 --> 03:18:54,369
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's... I mean, I get it that it's sort of at the discretion of the board, but... I understand that... So John Witten is our legal counsel on this, who helped with this, and I understand that he's available now on the call to speak to this as well.

1936
03:18:54,769 --> 03:18:55,870
[SPEAKER_15]: That's helpful, John.

1937
03:18:57,418 --> 03:18:58,858
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm happy to, Mr. Chairman.

1938
03:18:58,878 --> 03:19:11,062
[SPEAKER_22]: I think in response to the prior question, this would only apply to multiple dwellings, to a structure that would trigger use 18 or use 19.

1939
03:19:11,662 --> 03:19:21,145
[SPEAKER_22]: So a standalone florist or a standalone retail store would be governed under another set of principles in the ordinance.

1940
03:19:21,565 --> 03:19:25,146
[SPEAKER_22]: So this would only relate to multiple dwellings

1941
03:19:27,163 --> 03:19:31,485
[SPEAKER_22]: Whether it's over three stories or under three stories.

1942
03:19:31,525 --> 03:19:33,725
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not what I was, I wasn't really suggesting that.

1943
03:19:33,765 --> 03:19:51,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just suggesting that it seems like there's a strange line as to how it gets determined what percentage, be it 100 or less of that ground floor gets used.

1944
03:19:52,005 --> 03:19:56,027
[SPEAKER_07]: It's mandated to be used as retail by the board.

1945
03:19:56,367 --> 03:19:56,587
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

1946
03:19:56,667 --> 03:19:56,987
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no.

1947
03:19:57,507 --> 03:19:57,827
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1948
03:19:57,867 --> 03:19:59,488
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand the question now, and I apologize.

1949
03:20:00,148 --> 03:20:01,468
[SPEAKER_22]: No, that's an excellent question.

1950
03:20:01,769 --> 03:20:05,390
[SPEAKER_22]: But I will go back to Alicia's response, which I think is the correct response.

1951
03:20:05,970 --> 03:20:09,191
[SPEAKER_22]: The city council does have discretion as a special permit.

1952
03:20:09,271 --> 03:20:16,254
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think your point, which I agree with, is, well, what if somebody has 50% of the first floor as a stock room?

1953
03:20:16,954 --> 03:20:19,535
[SPEAKER_22]: Does that comport with what's required here?

1954
03:20:20,015 --> 03:20:23,758
[SPEAKER_22]: The city council would have discretion to say no, that's not acceptable.

1955
03:20:23,979 --> 03:20:28,222
[SPEAKER_22]: It's too much non usable non residential space.

1956
03:20:28,983 --> 03:20:38,372
[SPEAKER_22]: I think, I think that there has to be a little bit of faith in the special permit process, because it does give flexibility to the city into the council.

1957
03:20:39,012 --> 03:20:40,653
[SPEAKER_22]: to deal with specific applications.

1958
03:20:41,473 --> 03:20:47,976
[SPEAKER_22]: Where it was before on the original draft from the mayor, 25% was a fixed number.

1959
03:20:48,556 --> 03:20:49,817
[SPEAKER_22]: That was an exact number.

1960
03:20:50,657 --> 03:20:56,960
[SPEAKER_22]: My opinion is the first floor language, which was the takeaway I think we all had from the last meeting with the board.

1961
03:20:57,700 --> 03:21:02,122
[SPEAKER_22]: The first floor language gives a lot more discretion to the applicant and to the city council.

1962
03:21:02,762 --> 03:21:04,443
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think would be a better outcome.

1963
03:21:04,903 --> 03:21:08,004
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think that was a kind of a productive improvement.

1964
03:21:08,064 --> 03:21:16,588
[SPEAKER_22]: And then Alicia also added, which I think is also a good idea, kind of the definitions of business and professional office, retail sales, and so on.

1965
03:21:17,149 --> 03:21:22,031
[SPEAKER_22]: So it does allow uses that were otherwise not going to be allowed.

1966
03:21:22,631 --> 03:21:27,432
[SPEAKER_22]: So it makes for the non-residential use a pretty broad range of options.

1967
03:21:27,952 --> 03:21:31,993
[SPEAKER_22]: The city council, as the special permit granting authority, can make sure it's not a scam.

1968
03:21:32,654 --> 03:21:39,355
[SPEAKER_22]: Your worst case scenario is 10% of the first floor is retail, and the rest is storage.

1969
03:21:39,815 --> 03:21:44,097
[SPEAKER_22]: That would not comport with the purpose and intent of the ordinance.

1970
03:21:44,117 --> 03:21:49,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I like that.

1971
03:21:54,770 --> 03:21:56,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Other board members want to speak now?

1972
03:21:56,692 --> 03:22:03,057
[SPEAKER_14]: We can also, there may be members of the public who want to talk, so we could also allow them to do so.

1973
03:22:03,077 --> 03:22:07,541
[SPEAKER_17]: David, are you raising your hand?

1974
03:22:10,864 --> 03:22:12,285
[SPEAKER_17]: No, okay, I wasn't sure.

1975
03:22:12,606 --> 03:22:14,767
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1976
03:22:16,089 --> 03:22:20,332
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there members of the public who have, who are here would like to speak?

1977
03:22:20,833 --> 03:22:22,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Annie, has anybody raised their hand?

1978
03:22:23,186 --> 03:22:25,087
[SPEAKER_29]: I also have one comment by email to read.

1979
03:22:25,687 --> 03:22:26,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

1980
03:22:29,189 --> 03:22:32,690
[SPEAKER_29]: So this is from, one moment.

1981
03:22:33,170 --> 03:22:47,977
[SPEAKER_29]: This is from Roberta Cameron at 12 North Street and her email says, hi, I have some concerns about the proposed zoning change to require either 25% or ground floor commercial square footage as a requirement for apartments.

1982
03:22:48,940 --> 03:22:55,123
[SPEAKER_29]: First, adding a special permit requirement is putting in place an additional barrier to creating housing that Medford needs.

1983
03:22:55,923 --> 03:22:59,765
[SPEAKER_29]: It will be very hard to eliminate or reduce this barrier once it is put in place.

1984
03:23:00,665 --> 03:23:07,448
[SPEAKER_29]: Second, I do not believe that all of the locations that would be subject to this requirement are appropriate for commercial use.

1985
03:23:08,288 --> 03:23:17,812
[SPEAKER_29]: A requirement like this should not be applied without considering a change to the zoning map to identify locations where mixed commercial slash residential use would be appropriate.

1986
03:23:18,870 --> 03:23:26,491
[SPEAKER_29]: Third, as the proposed zoning reads, the requirement would be for commercial uses that are currently allowed in those districts.

1987
03:23:27,331 --> 03:23:33,032
[SPEAKER_29]: Under our current zoning, there are very few commercial uses that are allowed within the apartment districts.

1988
03:23:33,773 --> 03:23:38,393
[SPEAKER_29]: It would not make sense to have zoning require space being dedicated for uses that are not allowed.

1989
03:23:39,274 --> 03:23:45,895
[SPEAKER_29]: I feel that it would be preferable to undertake further land use analysis and planning before enacting this type of zoning change.

1990
03:23:46,135 --> 03:23:47,255
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you for your consideration.

1991
03:23:49,512 --> 03:23:56,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1992
03:23:57,158 --> 03:23:57,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Annie?

1993
03:23:58,299 --> 03:23:59,619
[SPEAKER_15]: I can share.

1994
03:23:59,840 --> 03:24:01,921
[SPEAKER_15]: So actually I want to switch what I'm sharing.

1995
03:24:02,001 --> 03:24:07,105
[SPEAKER_15]: So Annie actually prepared this map for you.

1996
03:24:07,125 --> 03:24:08,946
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me share.

1997
03:24:08,966 --> 03:24:12,889
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is our zoning.

1998
03:24:17,309 --> 03:24:24,992
[SPEAKER_15]: and I'm gonna need to, I think, zoom in so you can see the relevant portions of it.

1999
03:24:26,013 --> 03:24:28,254
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, pardon me as I move this around a little.

2000
03:24:28,934 --> 03:24:44,521
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we have done here is we, Annie, grayed out the portions that are not impacted so that you can see the different locations that would be impacted by this zoning change.

2001
03:24:45,851 --> 03:24:53,814
[SPEAKER_15]: because we thought this would be helpful for people to have this illustrated view of these.

2002
03:24:54,334 --> 03:24:59,736
[SPEAKER_15]: We do have some odd zoning areas in Medford.

2003
03:25:02,537 --> 03:25:10,960
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know that this doesn't touch any of the I areas, which are zoned industrial, where housing is not actually allowed.

2004
03:25:12,961 --> 03:25:14,942
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you,

2005
03:25:15,392 --> 03:25:15,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2006
03:25:16,052 --> 03:25:19,534
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's helpful to have that as a background for people to refer to.

2007
03:25:21,275 --> 03:25:25,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Annie, I think there's a few people have raised their hands from the members of the public.

2008
03:25:26,097 --> 03:25:27,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you call on them?

2009
03:25:28,378 --> 03:25:29,278
[SPEAKER_20]: First is Navar.

2010
03:25:29,298 --> 03:25:32,399
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi there, can you hear me?

2011
03:25:33,380 --> 03:25:36,461
[SPEAKER_14]: And just for the record, just state your name and address, please.

2012
03:25:36,481 --> 03:25:38,082
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thank you.

2013
03:25:38,902 --> 03:25:43,624
[SPEAKER_03]: William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

2014
03:25:47,008 --> 03:25:56,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I have concerns about this proposal because here in the city of Medford, we use a higher tax rate on commercial than on residential.

2015
03:25:57,874 --> 03:26:05,198
[SPEAKER_03]: So this policy that we have is an intervention that benefits housing owners by a lower tax rate.

2016
03:26:05,338 --> 03:26:06,258
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty obvious.

2017
03:26:06,298 --> 03:26:07,659
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't pay as much in tax.

2018
03:26:09,170 --> 03:26:12,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Presumably, it's also supposed to benefit housing seekers.

2019
03:26:13,331 --> 03:26:16,332
[SPEAKER_03]: You see, because they're going to build more housing because of the lower tax rate.

2020
03:26:16,552 --> 03:26:17,733
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to build commercial.

2021
03:26:17,753 --> 03:26:18,673
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to build housing.

2022
03:26:18,713 --> 03:26:19,914
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cheaper taxes.

2023
03:26:20,734 --> 03:26:27,016
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's supposed to benefit people seeking housing because there's going to be more housing for us to seek for.

2024
03:26:28,216 --> 03:26:29,697
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're planning to tie up,

2025
03:26:31,727 --> 03:26:46,994
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're trying to up the commercial tax base by tying it in with housing creation, then the tax scheme is no longer to the mutual benefits of both housing seekers and housing owners, and that feels quite inequitable.

2026
03:26:47,655 --> 03:26:58,760
[SPEAKER_03]: The owners, that is apartment owners and homeowners, still get the tax break, but not as much housing gets built anymore, because they've tied it in with the expensive to build commercial.

2027
03:27:00,739 --> 03:27:10,745
[SPEAKER_03]: So even if the development goes forth, which I think is rather doubtful because we're in what's been unironically called a retail apocalypse.

2028
03:27:12,286 --> 03:27:23,172
[SPEAKER_03]: If this zoning has any effect at all, that is if they're building commercially otherwise wouldn't have, I'll reduce the housing, perhaps switch the first floor to something else.

2029
03:27:23,973 --> 03:27:27,835
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll increase the commercial space available to rent in the city of Medford.

2030
03:27:29,309 --> 03:27:35,854
[SPEAKER_03]: So it might seem like businesses are shouldering the burden of Medford's taxes.

2031
03:27:35,874 --> 03:27:38,677
[SPEAKER_03]: And that'd be good according to some people.

2032
03:27:39,938 --> 03:27:41,099
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's just not true.

2033
03:27:42,080 --> 03:27:45,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if anything, that's gonna put up the rents on homes that people are seeking.

2034
03:27:46,443 --> 03:27:48,205
[SPEAKER_03]: It could put down the rents on business.

2035
03:27:50,082 --> 03:27:59,867
[SPEAKER_03]: So it can't be said that the taxes are falling upon the businesses, because the businesses could rent space for a cheaper price than before.

2036
03:28:00,867 --> 03:28:11,053
[SPEAKER_03]: That means that it's falling upon renters, and future buyers are both going to have to contend with fewer options to buy or rent an apartment.

2037
03:28:11,073 --> 03:28:13,934
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2038
03:28:14,945 --> 03:28:17,605
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically what I don't like.

2039
03:28:18,946 --> 03:28:24,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember hearing last time a major justification to this, that we wanna increase our commercial tax base.

2040
03:28:25,887 --> 03:28:32,748
[SPEAKER_03]: If you wanna increase commercial, you lower the commercial tax rate, I would think.

2041
03:28:33,368 --> 03:28:35,269
[SPEAKER_03]: We currently reward it with a lower tax rate.

2042
03:28:35,889 --> 03:28:42,530
[SPEAKER_03]: We're upset with too much commercial, let's undo that intervention and increase it on residential if we have to.

2043
03:28:44,777 --> 03:28:46,398
[SPEAKER_03]: The demand for housing is there.

2044
03:28:46,898 --> 03:28:47,959
[SPEAKER_03]: People need housing.

2045
03:28:49,840 --> 03:29:01,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I worry that this is basically going to interfere with people fulfilling their wants, their needs and reasonable wants to have a place to live here in the city of Bedford.

2046
03:29:01,548 --> 03:29:06,091
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm really nervous about this proposal for that reason.

2047
03:29:06,892 --> 03:29:07,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2048
03:29:08,353 --> 03:29:09,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Navarro.

2049
03:29:13,416 --> 03:29:14,197
[SPEAKER_20]: Alex Lessenhop.

2050
03:29:15,969 --> 03:29:18,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Alex Bluffenhop, 28 Wright Avenue.

2051
03:29:18,370 --> 03:29:24,953
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with the commenters so far that I still have a lot of concerns about this.

2052
03:29:25,593 --> 03:29:33,096
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with a group called Housing Medford, and our most recent meeting, a number of our members raised a lot of concerns about this proposal.

2053
03:29:34,137 --> 03:29:42,080
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked mostly about the version with the 25% requirement, although I think that there's still a lot of

2054
03:29:42,493 --> 03:29:46,094
[SPEAKER_01]: potential issues with the first floor requirement, some of which have been raised already.

2055
03:29:47,054 --> 03:30:04,999
[SPEAKER_01]: My personal greatest fear is that this could present even more barriers to creating housing, and any barriers to housing will be more greatly greater barriers for affordable housing, just in terms of financing and getting a project built.

2056
03:30:05,079 --> 03:30:07,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Affordable housing projects are much more sensitive to that kind of thing.

2057
03:30:08,745 --> 03:30:15,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so any requirements like this can functionally end up being barriers.

2058
03:30:16,088 --> 03:30:21,191
[SPEAKER_01]: I really worry it would be an effective moratorium on more housing and more developments.

2059
03:30:22,391 --> 03:30:31,395
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition, there's already issues with, you know, retail spaces that maybe are less desirable.

2060
03:30:31,535 --> 03:30:36,117
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that a 25% requirement is going to encourage cafes.

2061
03:30:36,677 --> 03:30:38,038
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one thing that would encourage

2062
03:30:38,599 --> 03:30:49,542
[SPEAKER_01]: cafes and diverse kinds of businesses is more people around these neighborhoods to support them, more foot traffic once we're allowed to engage in that sort of thing again.

2063
03:30:50,483 --> 03:30:54,444
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just simply not enough people living in these areas to support these kinds of desirable businesses.

2064
03:30:55,704 --> 03:31:03,026
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just, it seems like a really still like kind of a blunt instrument to accomplish the stated goal.

2065
03:31:04,147 --> 03:31:04,747
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of

2066
03:31:05,183 --> 03:31:06,044
[SPEAKER_01]: concerns about it.

2067
03:31:06,424 --> 03:31:08,486
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really seem like the right way to go about it.

2068
03:31:08,506 --> 03:31:09,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

2069
03:31:09,607 --> 03:31:12,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Lessenhaupt.

2070
03:31:14,691 --> 03:31:15,511
[SPEAKER_20]: Dan Fairchild.

2071
03:31:16,692 --> 03:31:17,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.

2072
03:31:17,633 --> 03:31:20,515
[SPEAKER_13]: B. Daniel Fairchild, 54 Dwyer Circle.

2073
03:31:21,876 --> 03:31:25,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty much echoing the comments that have already been made, I think it's a mistake.

2074
03:31:27,321 --> 03:31:31,784
[SPEAKER_13]: In particular, eliminating by rights permitting

2075
03:31:32,845 --> 03:31:42,113
[SPEAKER_13]: is just going to prevent developers from even trying to do things because they won't know they'll be able to.

2076
03:31:42,133 --> 03:31:50,801
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be much better to design an ordinance that does all of the...

2077
03:31:52,950 --> 03:32:04,539
[SPEAKER_13]: does all the things that we want, instead of just lay it out, say what is permitted, what is not permitted, and in what areas.

2078
03:32:05,080 --> 03:32:08,703
[SPEAKER_13]: And yes, there's different areas in which different things are appropriate.

2079
03:32:08,723 --> 03:32:15,968
[SPEAKER_13]: So that might require some zoning changes to accommodate that.

2080
03:32:18,410 --> 03:32:32,611
[SPEAKER_13]: but then don't give city council the ability to halt all development effectively, because there are definitely people in this city who want to do that, and we need more housing, we need more affordable housing.

2081
03:32:33,512 --> 03:32:52,743
[SPEAKER_13]: So put those requirements in the ordinance, and then let developers be able to do it by right without having to worry that, oh, they're going to plan a project and spend years trying to get it going, and then city council will just reject it.

2082
03:32:54,064 --> 03:32:54,364
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2083
03:32:55,605 --> 03:32:56,105
[SPEAKER_14]: You be, Dan.

2084
03:33:00,067 --> 03:33:01,008
[SPEAKER_20]: Alexis Smith?

2085
03:33:05,783 --> 03:33:10,424
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, I'm Alexis Smith at Four Bellevue Terrace in South Medford.

2086
03:33:10,884 --> 03:33:14,045
[SPEAKER_23]: I just am gonna echo what a few folks that have already said.

2087
03:33:16,766 --> 03:33:31,189
[SPEAKER_23]: Even before the pandemic, it was difficult to fill retail spaces and even in areas that are really vibrant and have more residents to support those businesses than many areas of Medford do, particularly some of the areas that are being shown on this map.

2088
03:33:31,489 --> 03:33:35,070
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm thinking of some of the commercial spaces on Winter Hill, on Broadway.

2089
03:33:36,250 --> 03:33:42,694
[SPEAKER_23]: And I don't want to see more empty commercial spaces in random areas of Medford where there's not already a commercial base.

2090
03:33:44,737 --> 03:34:05,398
[SPEAKER_23]: I think the blanket requirement means that it could make it really, really difficult to finance housing projects because it's, you know, if, again, with the banks recognizing that, you know, there's a lot of commercial vacancies, particularly with the uncertainty now, I think that that could put a real damper on all development.

2091
03:34:06,318 --> 03:34:08,639
[SPEAKER_23]: and effectively make it harder to build housing.

2092
03:34:08,759 --> 03:34:17,323
[SPEAKER_23]: And that is, you know, as others have expressed, that's my number one priority, more housing and particularly more affordable housing, which the city desperately needs.

2093
03:34:18,023 --> 03:34:21,385
[SPEAKER_23]: If we want to spur commercial development, I think that's a fantastic goal.

2094
03:34:21,785 --> 03:34:31,490
[SPEAKER_23]: And if we want to have, you know, vibrant districts, we should concentrate and focus it and be really intentional about where we're requiring that rather than just doing something, you know, kind of blanket and citywide.

2095
03:34:33,105 --> 03:34:39,190
[SPEAKER_23]: And as others have mentioned, I think the special permit use for housing is a mistake and that's going in the wrong direction.

2096
03:34:39,210 --> 03:34:50,418
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, love the idea, but if this is a commercial goal, then it should be a commercial incentive strategy rather than kind of dampening housing strategy.

2097
03:34:50,899 --> 03:34:51,199
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks.

2098
03:34:53,361 --> 03:34:54,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Alexis.

2099
03:34:56,263 --> 03:34:57,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there other members of the public, Annie?

2100
03:35:01,087 --> 03:35:01,587
[SPEAKER_17]: You're muted.

2101
03:35:03,307 --> 03:35:08,689
[SPEAKER_20]: I received one comment via chat here from Mina Sharma, 6th Street.

2102
03:35:09,910 --> 03:35:20,854
[SPEAKER_20]: And they say, one, to clarify, does this zoning amendment override the zoning of apartment one, apartment two, et cetera, should be a holistic review as opposed to casual requirement in certain zones?

2103
03:35:21,574 --> 03:35:27,577
[SPEAKER_20]: Two, what kind of commercial slash mixed use parking requirements would be imposed on the new building and the neighborhood?

2104
03:35:28,317 --> 03:35:30,458
[SPEAKER_20]: And is that at the discretion of city council?

2105
03:35:31,161 --> 03:35:34,223
[SPEAKER_20]: Three, why aren't we encouraging mixed use versus forcing it?

2106
03:35:34,503 --> 03:35:43,610
[SPEAKER_20]: Four, in light of COVID and the impact of small businesses everywhere, does forcing, and that's where it ends.

2107
03:35:45,511 --> 03:35:47,773
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not sure if we can ask questions, but looking for clarification.

2108
03:35:51,395 --> 03:35:58,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anyone from the city want to try to tackle any of those questions or the comments that you've heard?

2109
03:36:01,042 --> 03:36:19,766
[SPEAKER_15]: I am sorry, I suppose that it is worth just in light of the comments, repeating stuff that I know the board has heard that, but that I do want to make sure everybody has heard that the intention here is a band-aid.

2110
03:36:20,106 --> 03:36:27,247
[SPEAKER_15]: It is a stopgap that the administration absolutely agrees that the right thing to do

2111
03:36:27,961 --> 03:36:36,464
[SPEAKER_15]: is to look at the city as a whole, look at how we can incentivize commercial, but actually what do we wanna be doing as a whole?

2112
03:36:36,484 --> 03:36:38,064
[SPEAKER_15]: How can we hear from the residents?

2113
03:36:38,524 --> 03:36:48,347
[SPEAKER_15]: So one of the other things that's on the agenda this evening is the board knows is the RFP to hire a consultant to do a comprehensive plan for the city.

2114
03:36:49,548 --> 03:36:57,050
[SPEAKER_15]: The concern is that a comprehensive plan will take a year for the planning piece of it

2115
03:36:57,523 --> 03:37:05,290
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we're looking at another six months to a year, at least of dealing with the zoning to get the zoning pieces of it done.

2116
03:37:05,770 --> 03:37:13,577
[SPEAKER_15]: And it would be unrealistic to think that we're gonna be seeing results, changes to our zoning in a few months out of that.

2117
03:37:14,037 --> 03:37:16,019
[SPEAKER_15]: The intention here is to do something.

2118
03:37:16,039 --> 03:37:24,726
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I have heard from people wanting to develop nine units, that size scale, 12 units,

2119
03:37:26,408 --> 03:37:31,412
[SPEAKER_15]: in along Salem Street, along other areas that are in these zones.

2120
03:37:32,853 --> 03:37:36,276
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've also been hearing, of course, from the very large developers.

2121
03:37:36,396 --> 03:37:45,122
[SPEAKER_15]: I honestly, I got a call from a developer who wanted to know if we wanted like another 400 unit luxury apartment building in Medford.

2122
03:37:45,903 --> 03:37:51,467
[SPEAKER_15]: And by the way, it was either an industrial or commercial zone.

2123
03:37:51,587 --> 03:37:53,409
[SPEAKER_15]: And if that was something the city was gonna support.

2124
03:37:53,489 --> 03:37:55,110
[SPEAKER_15]: So people really are looking to do that.

2125
03:37:55,737 --> 03:38:01,280
[SPEAKER_15]: And we feel like we need something now because we don't want to stop development from happening.

2126
03:38:01,700 --> 03:38:06,202
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to guide it in the interim while we do a community development plan.

2127
03:38:06,742 --> 03:38:11,124
[SPEAKER_15]: We also frankly need an expert economic development person.

2128
03:38:11,844 --> 03:38:21,088
[SPEAKER_15]: In the city's budget, one of the few positions overall, every vacant position for the city was cut except for a handful of them.

2129
03:38:21,809 --> 03:38:24,350
[SPEAKER_15]: And the city's commitment to economic development

2130
03:38:24,767 --> 03:38:31,072
[SPEAKER_15]: is that one of the positions that was not cut but is not yet filled was the economic development director.

2131
03:38:32,153 --> 03:38:49,947
[SPEAKER_15]: At this time, the mayor would like to have the state certify what the state funding to communities are to ensure that we're getting at least as much as we've been guessing at so that we don't have to do any further cuts before we hire that position.

2132
03:38:50,407 --> 03:38:54,230
[SPEAKER_15]: But it is one position that the mayor is very committed to hiring

2133
03:38:54,646 --> 03:38:58,308
[SPEAKER_15]: is somebody who could actually take a look at economic development.

2134
03:38:58,609 --> 03:38:59,749
[SPEAKER_15]: How do we spur it?

2135
03:39:00,150 --> 03:39:02,231
[SPEAKER_15]: How do we attract large businesses?

2136
03:39:02,711 --> 03:39:06,014
[SPEAKER_15]: What do we do to make sure that our small businesses don't go under?

2137
03:39:06,494 --> 03:39:09,976
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now through the community development office, we are working on that.

2138
03:39:10,357 --> 03:39:12,138
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a grant program out.

2139
03:39:12,538 --> 03:39:18,242
[SPEAKER_15]: We've awarded grants to 29 small and micro businesses in Medford.

2140
03:39:18,262 --> 03:39:20,143
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have another 30, actually we have 10 more

2141
03:39:23,282 --> 03:39:24,803
[SPEAKER_15]: that I'm going to award tomorrow.

2142
03:39:24,983 --> 03:39:29,586
[SPEAKER_15]: I literally couldn't get to it tonight, but I'm sending out 10 more award letters tomorrow.

2143
03:39:31,127 --> 03:39:36,310
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're trying to help these businesses to stay afloat and to keep going.

2144
03:39:36,950 --> 03:39:40,252
[SPEAKER_15]: This is just one more tool that we're trying to use right now.

2145
03:39:42,054 --> 03:39:49,218
[SPEAKER_15]: So, and I realize that that is repeat for all of the board, but in light of the questions that we were presented with, I thought I should share it.

2146
03:39:52,973 --> 03:39:58,956
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Annie, if there's no further questions from the public, I'm gonna close the, oh, I think we just got one.

2147
03:40:00,577 --> 03:40:01,837
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Mina raised her hand.

2148
03:40:02,437 --> 03:40:07,720
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you could call on her and then maybe after that, we'll close the public portion.

2149
03:40:08,380 --> 03:40:09,481
[SPEAKER_20]: Mina, you should be unmuted.

2150
03:40:09,501 --> 03:40:10,961
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2151
03:40:10,981 --> 03:40:14,123
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, my other question got cut off, but what I was trying to say was,

2152
03:40:15,011 --> 03:40:28,962
[SPEAKER_19]: is forcing commercial and mixed use actually still relevant, given that businesses are struggling and we cover that, but from someone who's trying to build in their perspective, a struggling business is not a strong business case to continue to build and develop.

2153
03:40:28,982 --> 03:40:30,323
[SPEAKER_19]: So I do think it's a hindrance.

2154
03:40:31,284 --> 03:40:43,174
[SPEAKER_19]: And the other question I had was just around what kind of parking regulations would be added into the development, given that there'll be in residential areas, because commercial has different rules, and how does all of that get tackled?

2155
03:40:44,881 --> 03:40:45,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mina.

2156
03:40:45,321 --> 03:40:47,203
[SPEAKER_14]: And can you just say your address for the record?

2157
03:40:47,864 --> 03:40:48,945
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep, 6th Street, Medford.

2158
03:40:49,605 --> 03:40:49,926
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2159
03:40:49,946 --> 03:40:56,612
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know, Alicia, or maybe John Witten, can you address that, the parking?

2160
03:40:56,672 --> 03:41:00,816
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know the answer to that, how that would work.

2161
03:41:03,258 --> 03:41:07,722
[SPEAKER_22]: So, Mr. Mr terminal I'll, I'll answer a part of that in defer to Alicia.

2162
03:41:08,082 --> 03:41:16,269
[SPEAKER_22]: So where there's a mixed use the zoning ordinance would the parking requirements for found in the zoning ordinance would apply to both.

2163
03:41:16,690 --> 03:41:25,577
[SPEAKER_22]: So if it's residential there will be the minimum requirements if it's commercial there'll be the minimum requirements, and those become the required numbers of parking spaces.

2164
03:41:26,778 --> 03:41:47,826
[SPEAKER_22]: because of the special permit provision, the city council will have a fair bit of built-in discretion, but in terms of how you would count the number of spaces required, it would be based on a per square footage as the table already requires, but now there'd be an amount for the retail, for example, and then there'd be the amount for the residential, and that would be the total amount required.

2165
03:41:51,753 --> 03:42:00,020
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll just add one last comment, as it feels a little arbitrary to leave the vision of what those businesses would look like to just city council.

2166
03:42:00,761 --> 03:42:10,929
[SPEAKER_19]: I think if it's meant to be open to actually encourage cafes and restaurants and whatever else is there, it shouldn't just be to a one body to decide whether they feel like it's a good fit.

2167
03:42:10,969 --> 03:42:15,032
[SPEAKER_19]: It should be, yes, in this zone, in this space, this is the type of business that's allowed.

2168
03:42:15,532 --> 03:42:20,296
[SPEAKER_19]: Either you build or you don't, but that's defining character of a neighborhood more than just

2169
03:42:21,868 --> 03:42:24,510
[SPEAKER_19]: and of hoping that someone sees this corner and sees opportunity.

2170
03:42:24,530 --> 03:42:32,896
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would say- And Mina- As opposed to just put this one requirement and then tackle the other pieces.

2171
03:42:32,956 --> 03:42:40,901
[SPEAKER_19]: I think these are very relevant things to someone who wants to develop and to look at it as a package change to the zoning, as opposed to just one at a time.

2172
03:42:40,921 --> 03:42:43,423
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, thank you.

2173
03:42:44,944 --> 03:42:48,026
[SPEAKER_14]: And Mina, I'm sorry, did all your questions get answered?

2174
03:42:48,066 --> 03:42:49,087
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that was the parking one.

2175
03:42:49,107 --> 03:42:50,808
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that there was another one that I,

2176
03:42:51,983 --> 03:42:57,204
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't remember if it was the.

2177
03:42:57,244 --> 03:43:02,686
[SPEAKER_19]: The other one was just why aren't we encouraging the development as opposed to forcing it?

2178
03:43:03,366 --> 03:43:12,848
[SPEAKER_19]: Because forcing it just feels like, oh, well, if I have to go through this and city council picks my business that goes on the first floor, I don't know if I want to do this as opposed to we encourage this.

2179
03:43:12,928 --> 03:43:14,849
[SPEAKER_19]: Here's what the city is doing to partner with you.

2180
03:43:15,549 --> 03:43:18,250
[SPEAKER_19]: This just feels like a negative thing going into it to begin with.

2181
03:43:19,436 --> 03:43:28,642
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm sharing this perception based on the conversation I've had with numerous people who would like to do things and build But they had a feeling about just how it was stated again.

2182
03:43:28,702 --> 03:43:38,188
[SPEAKER_19]: This was on the 25% was definitely a no-go First floor is a little bit more welcoming, but I think it should be encouraged as opposed to forced Thank you

2183
03:43:42,208 --> 03:43:50,557
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll close the public portion of the hearing now and turn it over to Jackie.

2184
03:43:50,597 --> 03:43:52,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you want to, I think you unmuted yourself.

2185
03:43:52,479 --> 03:43:53,661
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you want to say something?

2186
03:43:55,828 --> 03:44:07,155
[SPEAKER_28]: I just, I just wanted to go back to what Alicia was saying about this being a stopgap, and I definitely understand the concerns of the community, going forward.

2187
03:44:07,855 --> 03:44:12,878
[SPEAKER_28]: But one of the things that we definitely have to get back to and I wanted to highlight from the last meeting.

2188
03:44:13,418 --> 03:44:16,800
[SPEAKER_28]: is that you have to have a balance between commercial and residential base, right?

2189
03:44:17,481 --> 03:44:19,142
[SPEAKER_28]: And it's very hard to do that.

2190
03:44:19,162 --> 03:44:32,891
[SPEAKER_28]: One of the things that I am very, as an economic development specialist myself, I'm very happy to see that we've removed the language for the 25% because that wasn't based on an economic measure and it didn't seem like a smart growth initiative overall.

2191
03:44:33,611 --> 03:44:34,512
[SPEAKER_28]: But I think this is,

2192
03:44:35,743 --> 03:44:52,222
[SPEAKER_28]: In my opinion, I think this is enough for us to move forward until we have a comprehensive plan, it's hard to see how this all formulates outside of an actual comprehensive plan so as far as what the mayor in the city is trying to achieve, I think this is pretty much.

2193
03:44:53,352 --> 03:44:54,813
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it's okay.

2194
03:44:55,094 --> 03:45:02,220
[SPEAKER_28]: My opinion is that I would allow for it as is to move forward until we can get to that comprehensive plan.

2195
03:45:02,301 --> 03:45:07,646
[SPEAKER_28]: That's my final, I mean, that's my overall opinion on it, especially now that we've moved that 25% requirement.

2196
03:45:11,878 --> 03:45:15,599
[SPEAKER_21]: So I feel generally the same way that Jackie does.

2197
03:45:15,639 --> 03:45:20,381
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we're definitely in a better position by changing the language.

2198
03:45:21,921 --> 03:45:37,606
[SPEAKER_21]: There's something that still makes me feel a little funny about applying the same requirement to three stories and six stories, because the burden is quite different on a three-story housing development.

2199
03:45:37,646 --> 03:45:40,067
[SPEAKER_21]: That means they're only going to have two floors of housing.

2200
03:45:40,732 --> 03:45:44,314
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I don't know.

2201
03:45:44,554 --> 03:45:48,317
[SPEAKER_21]: It just seems like it may need a closer look.

2202
03:45:48,377 --> 03:46:05,347
[SPEAKER_21]: So I guess if there was some certainty that there is some flexibility in the review by city council of these future projects going forward to be able to make sure that it's actually feasible.

2203
03:46:06,828 --> 03:46:12,532
[SPEAKER_21]: whatever the commercial use of the ground floor is feasible with the housing.

2204
03:46:14,533 --> 03:46:15,613
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all I would just say.

2205
03:46:16,974 --> 03:46:21,257
[SPEAKER_21]: Because the first floor is not going to be 100% commercial use.

2206
03:46:21,277 --> 03:46:25,179
[SPEAKER_21]: You have to have an entrance and other supporting uses at the ground floor.

2207
03:46:25,219 --> 03:46:32,243
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just think that I should proceed with caution just to ensure that there's flexibility there.

2208
03:46:32,263 --> 03:46:35,545
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Christy.

2209
03:46:36,397 --> 03:46:39,540
[SPEAKER_15]: I do just want to put some things out there.

2210
03:46:39,560 --> 03:46:54,211
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't wanna make this more complicated, but the, I couldn't explain how city council was chosen as the special permit authority in this case.

2211
03:46:55,172 --> 03:47:04,500
[SPEAKER_15]: And the board, so anything the board puts forward at this time is gonna be a recommendation to the city council, not anything that they're bound by.

2212
03:47:05,168 --> 03:47:13,434
[SPEAKER_15]: And this board could put forward that it's the Community Development Board that is the permit granting authority.

2213
03:47:14,134 --> 03:47:27,043
[SPEAKER_15]: I know I was looking at our table and it varies a lot between SPA and SPC as who is the permit granting authority in a number of these cases.

2214
03:47:28,044 --> 03:47:29,385
[SPEAKER_15]: So I wanted to mention that.

2215
03:47:29,885 --> 03:47:33,087
[SPEAKER_15]: The other is that I would remind you that

2216
03:47:35,525 --> 03:47:40,949
[SPEAKER_15]: site plan review applies to all projects that are six units and up.

2217
03:47:41,610 --> 03:47:51,597
[SPEAKER_15]: So if it was more than six units or more, this body would have site plan review over it as well, and would not, so would have a say in it.

2218
03:47:52,678 --> 03:48:05,087
[SPEAKER_15]: That the, we didn't use the words mixed use in this, but we did have Allie go out and look at a number of other communities to see, and we will tell you that

2219
03:48:05,630 --> 03:48:29,556
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody that we found had a percent of required commercial, but a lot of, a lot, a number, a number of communities, maybe she could, I don't have the number in front of me, that she looked at had first floor commercial somewhere along certain corridors, somewhere in certain zoning districts, but first floor commercial was not uncommon.

2220
03:48:30,996 --> 03:48:33,457
[SPEAKER_15]: More than first floor was not common, right?

2221
03:48:34,322 --> 03:48:41,567
[SPEAKER_15]: So we did sort of take a look at those items because we had been asked for a comparison of how other communities do it.

2222
03:48:42,827 --> 03:48:46,710
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if Annie or Ali have any details on that that I'm missing.

2223
03:48:51,926 --> 03:48:53,247
[SPEAKER_21]: I agree with the first floor thing.

2224
03:48:53,287 --> 03:49:01,109
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's, you know, it's just that the review process, you know, just to make sure that the whole project is feasible.

2225
03:49:01,129 --> 03:49:20,574
[SPEAKER_21]: And anyway, it's something, there was a comment earlier that just got me like, oh, well, we have to make sure that the entire floor is for commercial use, but there has to be some other space that's non-commercial to support the other use of the building.

2226
03:49:21,701 --> 03:49:32,867
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll put the language up because the language here as it reads is actually non-residential uses as opposed to commercial.

2227
03:49:35,048 --> 03:49:37,510
[SPEAKER_28]: That might be fine.

2228
03:49:37,530 --> 03:49:38,090
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all right.

2229
03:49:38,130 --> 03:49:41,412
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I think we all have the language, Alicia.

2230
03:49:41,572 --> 03:49:43,673
[SPEAKER_14]: David, did you wanna say something?

2231
03:49:43,993 --> 03:49:44,553
[SPEAKER_14]: You are muted.

2232
03:49:45,854 --> 03:49:46,995
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, non-residential.

2233
03:49:49,557 --> 03:49:55,723
[SPEAKER_25]: Sure, I mean, I was not in favor of our in our last language from last month.

2234
03:49:56,924 --> 03:50:00,648
[SPEAKER_25]: And I don't think this makes me that much more comfortable it's certainly better.

2235
03:50:01,949 --> 03:50:09,977
[SPEAKER_25]: The comment about first floor in certain quarters, Alicia that probably makes a lot of sense and maybe more of what we would expect to see.

2236
03:50:11,111 --> 03:50:30,155
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, this is something that seems to apply in a broad footprint of the city, including a lot of neighborhoods and a lot of areas where I don't know that the non-residential makes a whole heck of a lot of sense because they're maybe not so well trafficked.

2237
03:50:31,475 --> 03:50:38,677
[SPEAKER_25]: And I do feel like we're sort of pushing demand that is probably not gonna be there for some time.

2238
03:50:39,528 --> 03:50:54,215
[SPEAKER_25]: You might not find a lot of push for commercial or retail until after you get your more comprehensive evaluation, which would probably allow us to do a better job a year or two from now under your current forecast.

2239
03:50:56,696 --> 03:51:00,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's what I was going to ask Jackie.

2240
03:51:00,998 --> 03:51:08,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Having more experience with this in the economic side, do you think now with what's going on with the pandemic that

2241
03:51:10,042 --> 03:51:14,849
[SPEAKER_08]: there could be a lot of empty retail as a result of this.

2242
03:51:17,882 --> 03:51:26,247
[SPEAKER_28]: So overall, I have not seen a huge increase in private investment or interest in any community.

2243
03:51:27,307 --> 03:51:39,814
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm guessing that this, I would assume that this is coming more from the staff, like the planning staff that pretty much, I thought maybe they had an inkling that this would be opening up for it.

2244
03:51:39,854 --> 03:51:45,097
[SPEAKER_28]: So I really can't speak on community without knowing what that looks like.

2245
03:51:46,700 --> 03:51:50,183
[SPEAKER_28]: It can definitely have an impact across communities.

2246
03:51:50,863 --> 03:51:57,828
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know Medford as being one of those hot areas for economic development.

2247
03:51:58,028 --> 03:52:05,674
[SPEAKER_28]: However, we've started to turn around with the change of the medical mall and then with the community, with the apartments that's coming over there.

2248
03:52:05,714 --> 03:52:09,336
[SPEAKER_28]: So I mean, it's hard to forecast that pretty much.

2249
03:52:10,730 --> 03:52:14,173
[SPEAKER_28]: sorry, I was caught off guard on that one, but I had to really think about it.

2250
03:52:14,293 --> 03:52:29,865
[SPEAKER_28]: And I mean, anything is possible to tell you the truth, but I would have to know more, a little bit more about what has been, what has cropped up to the city staff or the, to the planning staff or the community development staff, pretty much.

2251
03:52:30,205 --> 03:52:39,532
[SPEAKER_08]: It just seems like now with COVID-19 that, you know, it'll be a slower for businesses to come back and then there'll be new, you know, for new businesses to come.

2252
03:52:40,320 --> 03:52:45,149
[SPEAKER_08]: and that by that time in a couple years we'll have the plan ready.

2253
03:52:48,134 --> 03:52:50,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Which I think is what David was talking about.

2254
03:52:52,405 --> 03:52:57,947
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, I could definitely agree with that, but I mean, I can, when it comes to economic development, I can see it both ways.

2255
03:52:58,007 --> 03:53:04,249
[SPEAKER_28]: You can have a surge of private invest, you can have a surge of private interest, especially with housing.

2256
03:53:04,629 --> 03:53:13,353
[SPEAKER_28]: The housing market is, Alicia has already said that she's getting some responses from developers wanting to do that.

2257
03:53:15,513 --> 03:53:19,655
[SPEAKER_28]: So, I mean, I just don't, I don't know as far as Medford goes.

2258
03:53:20,683 --> 03:53:48,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, I think to me this was this was something and I in the thing I keep thinking about is the stopgap thing like This is this is not long term, you know, and it's hard to define that right like what is not long term and what's going on with our economy right now and all that but like It does seem like a little bit like we're sort of in a circle here like this is maybe a moot point to to Jackie's point or to

2259
03:53:50,506 --> 03:54:08,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Deanna's point, like maybe there won't be any development, but maybe it's a great time to do development and they're gonna continue to try to come in and create development where there should be a more appropriate mix of uses.

2260
03:54:10,542 --> 03:54:17,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you're building 10 houses, you have to create amenities for them, which include commercial uses.

2261
03:54:17,107 --> 03:54:19,089
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do understand why,

2262
03:54:21,450 --> 03:54:40,657
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a proposal, and I think to me, I'm very near the center on everybody's comments, but to the point that it's a stopgap, it does seem to me like it is probably pretty well-suited to say yes right now, and sorry for my children.

2263
03:54:44,267 --> 03:54:47,948
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I've really thought about this zoning proposal a lot.

2264
03:54:48,828 --> 03:54:52,789
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sympathetic to what the mayor is trying to accomplish.

2265
03:54:53,329 --> 03:55:01,631
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very sympathetic to creating vibrant, walkable places, and you need to have strong first floor commercial to do that.

2266
03:55:02,251 --> 03:55:07,072
[SPEAKER_14]: But I have, you know, three, I think three issues that I just can't get around.

2267
03:55:07,972 --> 03:55:13,333
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of them is, I think what's already been talked about is that we're,

2268
03:55:15,657 --> 03:55:23,599
[SPEAKER_14]: We continue to have a strong housing development real estate market, but a very weak commercial real estate market.

2269
03:55:24,199 --> 03:55:27,520
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's really collapsed, particularly on the restaurant side.

2270
03:55:27,660 --> 03:55:36,442
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I've seen figures estimating that 25% or more of all restaurants are going to go out of business through this crisis.

2271
03:55:37,122 --> 03:55:39,665
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's, we're just at the beginning of it.

2272
03:55:39,845 --> 03:55:46,053
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a lot of businesses that are even come back online and reopen are going to find over the next few months that they're just

2273
03:55:47,804 --> 03:55:48,825
[SPEAKER_14]: not making enough money.

2274
03:55:49,805 --> 03:55:56,670
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't have the density of people to seat everybody, to actually stay afloat.

2275
03:55:57,070 --> 03:56:02,813
[SPEAKER_14]: You're seeing now like Uber Eats and those kinds of services are taking 25 to 30% of the revenues of these places.

2276
03:56:02,853 --> 03:56:03,994
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's one concern.

2277
03:56:04,014 --> 03:56:05,235
[SPEAKER_14]: The second issue is that

2278
03:56:17,822 --> 03:56:22,308
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I haven't gone to all of these districts, but I've gone to some of them.

2279
03:56:22,328 --> 03:56:30,819
[SPEAKER_14]: I have one of them across the street from my house, an apartment one district, and it's hard for me to...

2280
03:56:33,204 --> 03:56:40,849
[SPEAKER_14]: imagine any kind of first floor commercial space being required, you know, in this area.

2281
03:56:41,029 --> 03:56:50,154
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll just, I took some pictures because I think it's helpful to see, and I'd like to share my screen to just show some of those pictures if I can.

2282
03:56:50,174 --> 03:56:54,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

2283
03:56:57,079 --> 03:56:59,260
[SPEAKER_14]: So I gotta get rid of this here.

2284
03:57:03,462 --> 03:57:03,722
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

2285
03:57:07,124 --> 03:57:07,884
[SPEAKER_25]: Hold on a second.

2286
03:57:07,944 --> 03:57:08,725
[SPEAKER_25]: Let me do that again.

2287
03:57:14,067 --> 03:57:16,469
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have so many things open on my screen at the moment.

2288
03:57:16,489 --> 03:57:16,529
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

2289
03:57:29,557 --> 03:57:32,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so this is Riverside Ave.

2290
03:57:32,680 --> 03:57:34,942
[SPEAKER_14]: I live on Riverside Ave on the other side of the street.

2291
03:57:35,542 --> 03:57:37,584
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is one of the apartment one districts.

2292
03:57:41,997 --> 03:57:45,758
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, you know, it's a completely residential neighborhood.

2293
03:57:46,078 --> 03:57:55,519
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no commercial, I think, prospects for this, nor would it be a really appropriate place to put it in.

2294
03:57:56,079 --> 03:58:09,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, given the proposal, what you're seeing here is maybe one or two family homes, so it wouldn't be required to have commercial, but a three family home would be required to have first floor commercial.

2295
03:58:10,924 --> 03:58:14,006
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that that would be, I think, inappropriate.

2296
03:58:14,026 --> 03:58:16,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see if I can.

2297
03:58:18,590 --> 03:58:21,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Andre, are you looking for some commentary?

2298
03:58:22,813 --> 03:58:26,095
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, let me just go through a few of these pictures.

2299
03:58:26,475 --> 03:58:28,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I was going to say, I live on Riverside, too.

2300
03:58:29,257 --> 03:58:29,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2301
03:58:30,919 --> 03:58:34,441
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's nowhere for my kids to go and get a candy bar.

2302
03:58:40,739 --> 03:58:52,442
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, down the street, across from the apartments, there has been a turnover in a small retail space that just cannot keep a tenant in it.

2303
03:58:52,682 --> 03:58:54,202
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, there's the brown brick building.

2304
03:58:54,222 --> 03:59:01,984
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know exactly what number it is, but it's across from the white homes, affordable homes that are there.

2305
03:59:02,724 --> 03:59:05,865
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, and it's within walking distance of Medford Square.

2306
03:59:07,395 --> 03:59:11,698
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and walking distance of Wegmans and those places.

2307
03:59:12,059 --> 03:59:15,241
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is, you might be surprised, but this is Salem Street.

2308
03:59:15,842 --> 03:59:24,328
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is that you, we actually have homes right on Salem Street and the whole spine of Salem Street is an apartment one district.

2309
03:59:25,249 --> 03:59:30,453
[SPEAKER_07]: You know- Yeah, but for instance, that brand new building that's going up, the 13 units or whatever.

2310
03:59:32,115 --> 03:59:34,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, but- I go by that every day and I think, wow,

2311
03:59:37,362 --> 03:59:37,682
[SPEAKER_14]: You know.

2312
03:59:39,003 --> 03:59:41,664
[SPEAKER_14]: But what I'm saying is that this is Salem Street too.

2313
03:59:43,666 --> 03:59:51,390
[SPEAKER_14]: I look at this and I wouldn't say we should require first floor commercial up and down Salem Street.

2314
03:59:51,870 --> 03:59:59,835
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say this is- I think if you're putting a three plus unit building in, I don't know that I agree.

2315
04:00:00,521 --> 04:00:03,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, this is Salem Street and there are triple deckers right there.

2316
04:00:03,782 --> 04:00:10,543
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you would want to require somebody to put in a commercial space on the first floor?

2317
04:00:10,563 --> 04:00:16,304
[SPEAKER_14]: That seems, I mean, this is apartment one district right here.

2318
04:00:18,145 --> 04:00:27,967
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, it seems like maybe one of the flaws, but it says like three stories and not any real square footage metrics.

2319
04:00:32,078 --> 04:00:46,514
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe in the spirit of the zoning amendment, I just think that there's so many more things that are going to come forward that are more complicated as a result of it.

2320
04:00:47,355 --> 04:00:51,300
[SPEAKER_21]: So, and I just, that's where my concern of flexibility in the review.

2321
04:00:53,112 --> 04:01:06,006
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, usually you say, if we encourage mixed use and if you can get mixed use into your development that's, you know, meets a certain square footage threshold, great.

2322
04:01:06,146 --> 04:01:09,951
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you do a little more, your incentive is we might give you more density.

2323
04:01:12,189 --> 04:01:14,610
[SPEAKER_21]: So like where is incentive-based planning to?

2324
04:01:15,150 --> 04:01:33,396
[SPEAKER_15]: It seems to me- One thing to point out right now in the apartment one and two districts, all of those items, business or professional office, retail sales, consumer service business, or eating place are not actually allowed and they need a use variance.

2325
04:01:33,876 --> 04:01:41,438
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's a big debate within our zoning board of appeals, but some of the members do not believe they can legally give use variances.

2326
04:01:42,004 --> 04:01:56,050
[SPEAKER_15]: So the flip side is that those parts of Salem Street where you might wanna see commercial on the first floor, this would allow that to occur, whereas right now, it actually doesn't allow it to occur.

2327
04:01:57,495 --> 04:02:00,597
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think that there's a, I agree with that.

2328
04:02:01,557 --> 04:02:11,442
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think that, and I was hoping that the proposal coming back would be a little bit more nuanced in this way, that it wouldn't require it, but allow it.

2329
04:02:15,024 --> 04:02:23,328
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I guess for me, my feeling is this proposal could work in the C1 district,

2330
04:02:24,816 --> 04:02:32,820
[SPEAKER_14]: but I don't really see how you can make it work in the apartment one and apartment two districts.

2331
04:02:33,160 --> 04:02:34,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Alicia, can I ask you a question?

2332
04:02:36,101 --> 04:02:45,306
[SPEAKER_07]: You had mentioned that this was basically, you know, in a way, you know, designating some part of the first floor as having to have this.

2333
04:02:45,626 --> 04:02:52,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you characterize it as a sort of a situation where the

2334
04:02:55,275 --> 04:03:02,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess city council and the proponent would work together on a solution.

2335
04:03:03,642 --> 04:03:09,566
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be like just say you need to do this.

2336
04:03:10,767 --> 04:03:18,033
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to tell you that I'm not clear that I can respond to that because

2337
04:03:19,005 --> 04:03:32,536
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a number of times where the city council is the permit granting authority in our table of uses, but I have never actually witnessed one of those things come about.

2338
04:03:32,736 --> 04:03:43,244
[SPEAKER_15]: I've watched where the zoning board of appeals is, and they work together, and the community development board is, and they work together, but I've never had the opportunity

2339
04:03:45,248 --> 04:03:47,149
[SPEAKER_15]: to one of those meetings.

2340
04:03:47,629 --> 04:03:53,333
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not designating a percentage or a set amount, then what else could it be?

2341
04:03:54,093 --> 04:03:56,075
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, they have to negotiate.

2342
04:03:56,095 --> 04:03:59,797
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be some sort of negotiation as to what they're gonna provide, right?

2343
04:04:00,538 --> 04:04:10,764
[SPEAKER_07]: And to that point, if appropriate, could the city council say,

2344
04:04:12,498 --> 04:04:17,329
[SPEAKER_07]: based on the proponent's request, say, you know, in this case, we don't think you need it.

2345
04:04:18,291 --> 04:04:19,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a possibility?

2346
04:04:19,213 --> 04:04:21,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Is 0% a possibility?

2347
04:04:23,377 --> 04:04:31,444
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Chairman, no, that would not be, the way it's drafted now, the Special Permit Granting Authority shall require.

2348
04:04:31,684 --> 04:04:35,427
[SPEAKER_22]: So no, they wouldn't have that kind of discretion to ignore it.

2349
04:04:35,827 --> 04:04:43,013
[SPEAKER_22]: They certainly would have discretion to negotiate the actual footprint and the use, but no, they wouldn't be able to waive it.

2350
04:04:43,653 --> 04:04:46,596
[SPEAKER_15]: So they could allow the way this is written?

2351
04:04:47,439 --> 04:05:01,443
[SPEAKER_15]: They could say, well, you could have a little cafe in the corner and the rest be parking and apartments above it because we agree that you can't rent out commercial and we think you need lots of parking.

2352
04:05:02,083 --> 04:05:04,384
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be within the scope of this.

2353
04:05:04,404 --> 04:05:08,245
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be my preference that they not do that, right?

2354
04:05:08,305 --> 04:05:13,667
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't actually wanna see first floor parking as a particularly good use.

2355
04:05:16,188 --> 04:05:20,910
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not the intent, but it would be legal under this.

2356
04:05:20,950 --> 04:05:31,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one more thing, and this is sort of anecdotal, but I worked on a project in Cambridge where it's actually a project over in Fresh Pond.

2357
04:05:34,357 --> 04:05:43,222
[SPEAKER_07]: The city of Cambridge actually mandated that a certain amount of the square footage of the ground floor of the building

2358
04:05:44,648 --> 04:05:46,869
[SPEAKER_07]: was adaptable to retail.

2359
04:05:49,450 --> 04:06:02,234
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, as built the buildings there today, it's the one you look at when you see when you when you're at Somerset, the whole ground floor is basically amenity space for the building.

2360
04:06:02,494 --> 04:06:11,217
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the in the documents, it was a we had to submit a plan for retail space that could be

2361
04:06:11,838 --> 04:06:17,022
[SPEAKER_07]: or a part of the ground floor that could be changed into retail space at a later date, if appropriate.

2362
04:06:17,042 --> 04:06:20,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that whole district is sort of emerging, right?

2363
04:06:21,365 --> 04:06:25,809
[SPEAKER_07]: It was warehouses and labs, and now it's housing.

2364
04:06:25,909 --> 04:06:38,459
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if that has any interest to anybody, but it's an interesting way of thinking about it.

2365
04:06:40,395 --> 04:06:42,237
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Katie, please.

2366
04:06:42,277 --> 04:06:55,109
[SPEAKER_18]: Just seeing your photos and then, Klaus, you're discussing, I think you're talking about that unit on Salem Street that's right by the Roberts School, the new one that they're building, right, Klaus?

2367
04:06:55,329 --> 04:06:59,092
[SPEAKER_18]: It's interesting to have that visual of the different types of housing, right?

2368
04:06:59,133 --> 04:07:02,656
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Andre, your photographs of the homes

2369
04:07:03,893 --> 04:07:08,555
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that makes sense to me that those don't feel like the right place to have something commercial.

2370
04:07:08,895 --> 04:07:13,537
[SPEAKER_18]: But then when you think about like a 13 unit building, right?

2371
04:07:13,597 --> 04:07:17,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, I don't know, I think it's funny, my kids go to the Roberts, right?

2372
04:07:17,718 --> 04:07:21,019
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm in that area all the time, or they did when schools were open.

2373
04:07:21,560 --> 04:07:29,263
[SPEAKER_18]: And I always think like that could be a perfect place right there on that corner for some kind of cafe, particularly if you're building all those places.

2374
04:07:29,303 --> 04:07:32,744
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think in addition to thinking about the impact on

2375
04:07:33,322 --> 04:07:39,503
[SPEAKER_18]: sort of housing in general, it's also like the kind of buildings, and that, I just thought those visuals were helpful.

2376
04:07:40,344 --> 04:07:46,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, I asked, I remember last time we had this discussion, I asked, I said, what is the threshold?

2377
04:07:46,765 --> 04:07:56,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I totally agree with you, and I agree with you, Andre, that, you know, in this, like, two-family district, I mean, it doesn't make much sense.

2378
04:07:57,688 --> 04:08:02,449
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're gonna buy, like, four lots and tear four buildings down and build a, you know,

2379
04:08:03,073 --> 04:08:06,995
[SPEAKER_07]: a 20-unit building, well, that kind of makes sense to me, you know?

2380
04:08:07,035 --> 04:08:07,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I could see that.

2381
04:08:09,356 --> 04:08:18,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's 50 other, like, restrictions that are gonna be put on you by the town, you know, do this, this, this, this, and this, so.

2382
04:08:19,060 --> 04:08:30,305
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I mean, I lived in Arlington, Virginia for a while, and in all of their, like, apartment buildings there, the first floor is dedicated, like, convenience stores, coffee shops, right?

2383
04:08:30,365 --> 04:08:31,626
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like, it's sort of the,

2384
04:08:32,019 --> 04:08:35,084
[SPEAKER_18]: the character of at least the neighborhood I lived in with the buildings.

2385
04:08:35,124 --> 04:08:37,367
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was nice, right?

2386
04:08:37,388 --> 04:08:41,935
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you just sort of knew that that was like accessible street level space.

2387
04:08:43,520 --> 04:08:48,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, but there has to be a certain density allowed to be able to support that kind of retail and commercial.

2388
04:08:49,003 --> 04:08:55,167
[SPEAKER_14]: And so even if you look at Salem Street, it's only an apartment one district, which means it only allows three stories.

2389
04:08:55,748 --> 04:09:09,576
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's hard to, for me, it's hard to say to property owners along that corridor that you're responsible for, you can only have three stories, but you're responsible for a vibrant street environment.

2390
04:09:09,736 --> 04:09:12,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's- So Andre, just as a counterpoint,

2391
04:09:13,406 --> 04:09:17,210
[SPEAKER_07]: say something about the stopgap thing.

2392
04:09:18,832 --> 04:09:23,177
[SPEAKER_07]: You're concerned about this even in the short term.

2393
04:09:25,119 --> 04:09:32,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, yeah, because we're fundamentally changing these corridors, and I think that... Or not changing them.

2394
04:09:33,464 --> 04:09:46,850
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, class, I mean, look, one of the concerns I haven't mentioned, which is my third concern, is that, look, this mayor has made a priority of transparency and planning, which I am very happy about and I support.

2395
04:09:48,691 --> 04:09:49,672
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not that.

2396
04:09:50,772 --> 04:09:59,957
[SPEAKER_14]: This would be rezoning hundreds of people's homes without really a process around asking them.

2397
04:10:00,953 --> 04:10:09,358
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I don't necessarily think this is what she, an outcome that people would intend.

2398
04:10:09,558 --> 04:10:19,704
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I think that, I think this is really problematic if people realize that people get very upset about changing the zoning around their homes and they wanna be part of that.

2399
04:10:20,124 --> 04:10:21,025
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this would be,

2400
04:10:22,257 --> 04:10:30,242
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we're changing the zoning without really that kind of nuanced community engagement process around it.

2401
04:10:30,342 --> 04:10:39,568
[SPEAKER_14]: So I totally agree that we, first of all, the mayor has said that her first priority is to not lose more commercial areas.

2402
04:10:39,969 --> 04:10:46,273
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would be comfortable moving ahead with the C1 having a first floor commercial requirement.

2403
04:10:47,863 --> 04:10:48,623
[SPEAKER_14]: and that piece of it.

2404
04:10:49,024 --> 04:10:58,507
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel less comfortable about apartment one and apartment two, given what I've actually seen when I'm looking at what's there.

2405
04:10:59,387 --> 04:11:06,810
[SPEAKER_14]: And especially with not engaging people around what they think about.

2406
04:11:07,290 --> 04:11:12,412
[SPEAKER_14]: I know in my neighborhood, I don't think people would, if people realize that we,

2407
04:11:13,791 --> 04:11:16,272
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to be a board that does that.

2408
04:11:42,785 --> 04:11:46,286
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, incentives or more nuanced doing it district by district.

2409
04:11:46,326 --> 04:12:08,795
[SPEAKER_14]: But I really think like we should be in this time where we're having such a real problem with commercial space and filling it and having these, you know, the retail and the restaurant environment that we have right now, like we should be really focused on how can we support Medford square to make sure it stays vibrant and we don't lose businesses and vacant storefronts there, or, you know,

2410
04:12:10,604 --> 04:12:16,407
[SPEAKER_14]: and looking at the other commercial walkable hubs in our city and really strengthening them.

2411
04:12:16,467 --> 04:12:20,709
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's really what I'd like to focus on.

2412
04:12:25,111 --> 04:12:26,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I appreciate that.

2413
04:12:26,111 --> 04:12:29,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's really good points all around this issue.

2414
04:12:29,733 --> 04:12:37,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's hard to, I don't know, I'm finding it hard to really pick a side.

2415
04:12:37,176 --> 04:12:37,417
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean,

2416
04:12:40,105 --> 04:12:41,566
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's what goes back to me.

2417
04:12:41,826 --> 04:12:48,751
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm glad that Deanna brought up the question about what I thought about the forecast for Medford.

2418
04:12:48,791 --> 04:12:55,555
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, you know, being transparent, obviously I work at the state level and that's what we do.

2419
04:12:55,975 --> 04:13:05,261
[SPEAKER_28]: And not only are we ensuring economic development and housing, but my secretary is also vice chair of the reopening plan.

2420
04:13:05,281 --> 04:13:07,303
[SPEAKER_28]: So I know, I see a little bit more and so,

2421
04:13:08,163 --> 04:13:22,926
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, there has been some issues but also I know that Massachusetts is leading in the health of its, its, its residents as well as keeping with the economy and yes there's been a lot of hits and we may see a lot, we just don't know I mean there's not.

2422
04:13:24,348 --> 04:13:25,309
[SPEAKER_28]: You just hope for the best.

2423
04:13:25,369 --> 04:13:29,392
[SPEAKER_28]: I know, for instance, there's a neighborhood kitchen that's right on Spring Street.

2424
04:13:29,452 --> 04:13:33,635
[SPEAKER_28]: They thought they were going to go under in the pandemic, and they're just as vibrant.

2425
04:13:33,655 --> 04:13:44,263
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know if it's because it's going along with the culture of the community right now where we're emphasizing a certain kind of trend with minority-owned and Black-owned businesses or anything like that, but it's thriving.

2426
04:13:44,343 --> 04:13:45,764
[SPEAKER_28]: So there's potential.

2427
04:13:45,824 --> 04:13:50,867
[SPEAKER_28]: I can see the arguments on both sides, but at the same time,

2428
04:13:53,063 --> 04:13:53,904
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, I just don't know.

2429
04:13:55,045 --> 04:13:55,986
[SPEAKER_28]: It's really hard.

2430
04:13:56,046 --> 04:14:05,254
[SPEAKER_28]: I have to tell you, it's really hard seeing this absent of a comprehensive plan, but I can definitely see how this can be a short term, but I can also see how it can be an issue.

2431
04:14:05,374 --> 04:14:09,017
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm with Claes, I'm a little conflicted.

2432
04:14:10,138 --> 04:14:14,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what we need to do is really just make a recommendation to the city council.

2433
04:14:14,582 --> 04:14:16,984
[SPEAKER_14]: The city council is gonna make a determination on it.

2434
04:14:18,325 --> 04:14:19,026
[SPEAKER_14]: We could,

2435
04:14:20,764 --> 04:14:21,684
[SPEAKER_14]: recommend the whole thing.

2436
04:14:22,044 --> 04:14:25,105
[SPEAKER_14]: We could not recommend the whole thing.

2437
04:14:25,205 --> 04:14:26,526
[SPEAKER_14]: We could recommend a portion of it.

2438
04:14:26,586 --> 04:14:32,188
[SPEAKER_14]: We could recommend that some tweaks be made to it.

2439
04:14:34,328 --> 04:14:40,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Andre, I like the idea that you brought up about recommending it for the, what is it, the C1 district?

2440
04:14:41,251 --> 04:14:44,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and the MUZ district is also a mixed use zone.

2441
04:14:49,270 --> 04:15:09,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, honestly, Andre, the one thing that you said to me that actually really resonated, and I'm all for the idea of mixed use and diversifying the neighborhoods and all that, but the one thing that did really strike me when you were talking was that you said about Medford Square and really trying to preserve the businesses that we have there.

2442
04:15:09,868 --> 04:15:15,032
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought that was a really sort of good point.

2443
04:15:18,207 --> 04:15:32,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it was a year ago or whenever, we were at the height of development and things going well, and still there's stores being closed and banks being put in in Medford Square.

2444
04:15:33,059 --> 04:15:41,626
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the kind of thing that really, I think, from a long-term vision, this city really needs.

2445
04:15:41,907 --> 04:15:46,330
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know, that comment resonated with me, and I think I could probably get behind

2446
04:15:48,703 --> 04:15:54,525
[SPEAKER_07]: suggesting not doing the apartment districts.

2447
04:16:00,267 --> 04:16:04,409
[SPEAKER_14]: What does some of the other board members feel?

2448
04:16:06,609 --> 04:16:10,051
[SPEAKER_18]: I would support that narrow approach, for sure.

2449
04:16:11,211 --> 04:16:16,033
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it seems to make most sense now that we've talked through it all.

2450
04:16:18,137 --> 04:16:31,446
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, if we can't make our commercial district successful now, it's a little concerning just blanketly throwing it across apartment one and apartment two.

2451
04:16:31,466 --> 04:16:37,170
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think there's any question that it belongs in C1 and the mixed use district.

2452
04:16:39,532 --> 04:16:41,473
[SPEAKER_21]: But yeah, it seems to make most sense to me.

2453
04:16:42,294 --> 04:16:46,797
[SPEAKER_14]: And Alicia or John Witten, is there any way you think that

2454
04:16:48,073 --> 04:16:50,974
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if that's the mayor's intent, but from a

2455
04:17:19,363 --> 04:17:24,825
[SPEAKER_22]: I think I, you know, Mr john if I, if I could just add, and I know the board's been at this for a long time.

2456
04:17:25,585 --> 04:17:42,172
[SPEAKER_22]: I think one of the obvious takeaways that I know we're all probably in agreement, which is, if development is left to the private sector, without special permit requirements, then the city's going to get what the private sector wants to deliver.

2457
04:17:43,260 --> 04:17:49,284
[SPEAKER_22]: The special permit is a way of guiding growth in concert with your comprehensive plan and zoning.

2458
04:17:49,865 --> 04:17:58,271
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's a balance, but uses by right, structures by right are very laissez-faire.

2459
04:17:58,451 --> 04:18:03,594
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, but they don't often deliver what the municipality wants.

2460
04:18:03,915 --> 04:18:07,617
[SPEAKER_22]: The private sector gets what it wants and the city gets what the private sector gives them.

2461
04:18:08,238 --> 04:18:11,360
[SPEAKER_22]: The special permit approach is the way to control your future.

2462
04:18:11,600 --> 04:18:28,690
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, again, I know everyone on this call knows this, but that I think is a big distinction between an ordinance that has a special permit requirements and requires that super majority vote versus structures and uses that are encouraged or cajole.

2463
04:18:29,411 --> 04:18:37,436
[SPEAKER_22]: In my experience, in my career, developers do what they want, and it's up to the municipality to guide the outcome.

2464
04:18:37,736 --> 04:18:40,938
[SPEAKER_22]: And the only way to do that in the Commonwealth is through a special permit.

2465
04:18:53,633 --> 04:18:58,755
[SPEAKER_14]: What is the difference between the two districts?

2466
04:19:24,495 --> 04:19:25,316
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to avoid that.

2467
04:19:25,616 --> 04:19:37,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the property is now nonconforming to have to go to a ZBA and if they do renovations or something, they have to get a permit from them that they might not have had to get before.

2468
04:19:37,645 --> 04:19:41,368
[SPEAKER_14]: That is the kind of thing I would like to avoid.

2469
04:19:41,388 --> 04:19:42,989
[SPEAKER_14]: I would be comfortable with

2470
04:19:54,682 --> 04:20:01,888
[SPEAKER_14]: moving it to special permit, but not requiring the commercial, and then maybe leaving apartment one out.

2471
04:20:13,416 --> 04:20:15,358
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I hear you, Andre.

2472
04:20:16,739 --> 04:20:17,239
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems...

2473
04:20:22,585 --> 04:20:29,550
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems too intricate for the spirit of what's trying to be done, but you know.

2474
04:20:31,952 --> 04:20:36,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, let's take the temperature of all the board members here.

2475
04:20:37,516 --> 04:20:38,797
[SPEAKER_21]: So I've got a question.

2476
04:20:39,498 --> 04:20:40,939
[SPEAKER_21]: Something that you said just triggered something.

2477
04:20:40,959 --> 04:20:50,746
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, if I own a two or three family and I decide I want to, you know, tear it down and build new,

2478
04:20:52,862 --> 04:20:57,303
[SPEAKER_21]: am I going to be subject to having to do commercial on the first floor?

2479
04:20:58,643 --> 04:20:59,864
[SPEAKER_14]: John, do you want to address that?

2480
04:20:59,884 --> 04:21:00,904
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure.

2481
04:21:01,764 --> 04:21:03,645
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

2482
04:21:04,585 --> 04:21:08,286
[SPEAKER_22]: And the chair and I were in touch today on kind of a similar question.

2483
04:21:08,386 --> 04:21:12,667
[SPEAKER_22]: So a pre-existing nonconforming use or a pre-existing nonconforming structure,

2484
04:21:13,588 --> 04:21:26,277
[SPEAKER_22]: can expand or alter or change, provided it gets a finding from the Board of Appeals, this is in the Medford Ordinance, that is consistent with General Laws Chapter 48, Section 6.

2485
04:21:27,498 --> 04:21:33,702
[SPEAKER_22]: That does not necessarily require the compliance with this new ordinance.

2486
04:21:35,363 --> 04:21:40,507
[SPEAKER_22]: The Special Permit Granting Authority, the Board of Appeals, is obligated to try to

2487
04:21:41,877 --> 04:21:48,999
[SPEAKER_22]: require more conformance with what is the pre-existing structure, but in some cases it would be impossible.

2488
04:21:49,139 --> 04:22:02,264
[SPEAKER_22]: So in your example, no, they would not require you to comply with this new ordinance because if it were a conforming parcel, then it would have to comply.

2489
04:22:03,224 --> 04:22:09,106
[SPEAKER_22]: If it were a reconfigured parcel, that would then be a conforming parcel, it would have to comply.

2490
04:22:09,627 --> 04:22:16,940
[SPEAKER_22]: But those structures are uses that are rendered non-conforming by this ordinance, which aren't likely to be many.

2491
04:22:17,796 --> 04:22:23,501
[SPEAKER_22]: would be safe, they'd be protected, provided that they don't seek to expand, alter, or change.

2492
04:22:24,122 --> 04:22:30,047
[SPEAKER_22]: If they do right now today, they would need a finding from the Board of Appeals pursuant to the ordinance.

2493
04:22:30,468 --> 04:22:39,516
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know, I dare say in Medford and most municipalities in New England, 50%, 30% of the structures and uses are pre-existing non-conforming.

2494
04:22:39,556 --> 04:22:40,437
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just the nature of

2495
04:22:41,097 --> 04:22:45,580
[SPEAKER_22]: of the fact that zoning came into compliance in the 50s and everything was already pretty much built out.

2496
04:22:46,280 --> 04:22:49,923
[SPEAKER_22]: So Andrea and I did touch base on that a couple of times today.

2497
04:22:50,843 --> 04:22:53,285
[SPEAKER_22]: It is an issue, but it's an issue every time you change zoning.

2498
04:22:53,465 --> 04:23:02,490
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't see this zoning proposal from the mayor making it any substantially different than every other zoning change that the city faces.

2499
04:23:03,111 --> 04:23:07,033
[SPEAKER_22]: So if I have a preexisting nonconforming structure and I want to add a new wing to it,

2500
04:23:07,727 --> 04:23:16,593
[SPEAKER_22]: the residential component or the non-residential component, this ordinance is not going to apply to me because I am pre-existing non-conforming.

2501
04:23:16,653 --> 04:23:19,675
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm vested from new regulations.

2502
04:23:26,099 --> 04:23:33,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Along those lines, John, if they wanted to comply, though, they could.

2503
04:23:33,764 --> 04:23:36,086
[SPEAKER_15]: And what I'm thinking of, for example,

2504
04:23:36,728 --> 04:23:53,357
[SPEAKER_15]: is a commercial business, commercial building that exists in the apartment one district, which right now they could renovate as commercial, but if they wanted to tear down and rebuild as commercial, they couldn't.

2505
04:23:53,897 --> 04:24:03,242
[SPEAKER_15]: And if they wanted to put in a three-story building with a commercial on the first floor and the apartments above it, they actually are not allowed.

2506
04:24:03,462 --> 04:24:04,823
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be a use variant.

2507
04:24:05,927 --> 04:24:17,056
[SPEAKER_15]: And so they could choose to remain non-conforming, but if they wanted to comply and do apartments above, they would have to then be commercial.

2508
04:24:17,776 --> 04:24:18,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

2509
04:24:18,177 --> 04:24:18,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Or they could.

2510
04:24:19,097 --> 04:24:19,258
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

2511
04:24:19,318 --> 04:24:24,822
[SPEAKER_22]: And you can always choose to comply with the current code and not take advantage of the vesting that you have.

2512
04:24:25,342 --> 04:24:28,405
[SPEAKER_22]: And so your example, Alicia, yes, absolutely correct.

2513
04:24:34,610 --> 04:24:34,810
[SPEAKER_17]: So,

2514
04:24:36,844 --> 04:24:41,946
[SPEAKER_14]: We've heard public comments today also expressing some concerns.

2515
04:24:43,747 --> 04:24:49,269
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to organize this in a way that we can make a decision and move forward.

2516
04:24:54,131 --> 04:25:02,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe the best way of doing it is to do separate resolutions about the

2517
04:25:05,110 --> 04:25:06,310
[SPEAKER_14]: different pieces of it.

2518
04:25:06,410 --> 04:25:26,596
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we feel that there's consensus, which I think I've heard around the C1 and MUZ district, perhaps we can entertain a motion to get that out of the way and then focus on what's left to narrow it down a bit.

2519
04:25:26,616 --> 04:25:29,237
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that make sense?

2520
04:25:35,687 --> 04:25:47,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Would there be a motion to do something like that to address the C1 and MUZ first before we move on to the other zones?

2521
04:25:56,263 --> 04:26:00,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Or no people are reticent, what's the reticence?

2522
04:26:01,785 --> 04:26:10,771
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll make the motion to move ahead with the apartment, the commercial one in mixed use zones.

2523
04:26:10,811 --> 04:26:14,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a second?

2524
04:26:16,094 --> 04:26:16,454
[SPEAKER_18]: Second.

2525
04:26:18,115 --> 04:26:27,281
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's a motion on the floor to recommend to the city council adoption of

2526
04:26:28,641 --> 04:26:33,164
[SPEAKER_14]: the mayor's proposal for the C1 and MUZ district.

2527
04:26:35,725 --> 04:26:36,826
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll do a roll call vote.

2528
04:26:37,486 --> 04:26:38,207
[SPEAKER_14]: David Blumberg?

2529
04:26:39,267 --> 04:26:39,627
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

2530
04:26:41,228 --> 04:26:41,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Christy Dowd?

2531
04:26:43,329 --> 04:26:43,470
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

2532
04:26:44,310 --> 04:26:45,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Les Andresen?

2533
04:26:48,893 --> 04:26:49,013
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

2534
04:26:50,133 --> 04:26:50,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Jackie Furtado?

2535
04:26:54,176 --> 04:26:55,937
[SPEAKER_14]: You are muted, Jackie, could you just unmute?

2536
04:26:57,237 --> 04:26:57,998
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry, aye.

2537
04:26:58,780 --> 04:26:59,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2538
04:26:59,541 --> 04:27:00,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Katie McHugh?

2539
04:27:00,782 --> 04:27:00,942
[SPEAKER_28]: Aye.

2540
04:27:01,642 --> 04:27:02,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Deanna Peabody?

2541
04:27:03,143 --> 04:27:03,284
[SPEAKER_28]: Aye.

2542
04:27:04,164 --> 04:27:04,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2543
04:27:04,905 --> 04:27:11,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Unanimously approved that motion for the C1 and MUZ districts to adopt the proposal.

2544
04:27:13,011 --> 04:27:20,057
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, apartment two and apartment one, that leaves those for us to address.

2545
04:27:23,560 --> 04:27:26,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anyone want to make a motion for either one or both of those?

2546
04:27:29,732 --> 04:27:30,172
[SPEAKER_14]: districts?

2547
04:27:33,333 --> 04:27:37,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we should say let's let me before we do that, let's just take the temperature of the board members on this.

2548
04:27:37,935 --> 04:27:44,436
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just going to go one by one and give me your thoughts about where what you're thinking about those two districts.

2549
04:27:45,117 --> 04:27:45,377
[SPEAKER_14]: David?

2550
04:27:45,397 --> 04:27:48,158
[SPEAKER_14]: I would vote no in those two districts.

2551
04:27:50,198 --> 04:27:50,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Christy?

2552
04:27:55,120 --> 04:27:55,900
[SPEAKER_17]: You're muted, Christy.

2553
04:28:00,458 --> 04:28:23,076
[SPEAKER_21]: I agree with it in spirit, but I feel like there's still a lot of unknowns that could unintentionally burden those areas or not really result in what the mayor is trying to achieve there.

2554
04:28:23,596 --> 04:28:28,220
[SPEAKER_21]: So my inclination right now is to say no on those.

2555
04:28:30,667 --> 04:28:30,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Wes?

2556
04:28:36,250 --> 04:28:51,320
[SPEAKER_07]: My inclination is similar to what you had suggested, Andre, is to probably, and I can't remember exactly how you said this, but it was more of a recommendation rather than a requirement.

2557
04:28:56,028 --> 04:29:03,171
[SPEAKER_14]: to allow those uses that may not currently be allowed by right in those areas?

2558
04:29:04,651 --> 04:29:04,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2559
04:29:07,212 --> 04:29:12,634
[SPEAKER_14]: Would you tackle apartment two differently than apartment one, or would you include apartment one in that?

2560
04:29:13,794 --> 04:29:21,717
[SPEAKER_14]: I would, yeah, both of them.

2561
04:29:21,757 --> 04:29:22,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Jackie?

2562
04:29:24,288 --> 04:29:41,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and the other question, I'm sorry, Les, on those, I'm assuming that you would support the mayor's proposal to move both apartment two and apartment one from as of right permit for multifamily to special permit?

2563
04:29:44,972 --> 04:29:50,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think I would, yeah, I would leave everything the same in the wording except just change it from,

2564
04:29:53,358 --> 04:30:04,408
[SPEAKER_07]: a requirement to a recommendation and allowable use.

2565
04:30:06,210 --> 04:30:06,290
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

2566
04:30:06,330 --> 04:30:06,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Jackie?

2567
04:30:08,603 --> 04:30:11,984
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm unsure of the first part of the question.

2568
04:30:12,004 --> 04:30:19,067
[SPEAKER_28]: The second part, I echo Clay's, but can you please restate the first part?

2569
04:30:19,087 --> 04:30:33,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so I guess the first part of the question was whether you would treat apartment two and apartment one differently, and whether you would require or allow

2570
04:30:39,437 --> 04:30:42,981
[SPEAKER_14]: first floor commercial, and either or both of them.

2571
04:30:43,001 --> 04:30:57,860
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess, and then the third thing is the special permit piece, you know, do you support the special permit approval versus as a bright for the multifamily.

2572
04:31:04,256 --> 04:31:06,317
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, I do support the special permit.

2573
04:31:06,857 --> 04:31:17,119
[SPEAKER_28]: I would not want to require, I would want to recommend, or because to me it discourages mixed use as opposed to encouraging it.

2574
04:31:19,700 --> 04:31:30,022
[SPEAKER_28]: And then I guess I'm not really wrapping my head around the changes to the two zoning changes that we're speaking on.

2575
04:31:31,122 --> 04:31:32,623
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not wrapping my head around that.

2576
04:31:34,189 --> 04:31:41,772
[SPEAKER_15]: In the apartment one and two, these uses that are technically in blue, the added ones are not allowed.

2577
04:31:41,792 --> 04:31:53,536
[SPEAKER_15]: So a use variance would be needed in order to put in a first floor commercial in the apartment one and two districts.

2578
04:31:54,617 --> 04:32:03,160
[SPEAKER_15]: And our zoning board is giving those, wait, there's a word that means it's not quite arbitrarily,

2579
04:32:03,653 --> 04:32:11,496
[SPEAKER_15]: It depends who's hearing the case, because some members of the zoning board refuse to give use variances on principle.

2580
04:32:12,877 --> 04:32:28,462
[SPEAKER_15]: So right now, without having language like this that says a special permit shall recommend or shall allow the first floor development contain these non-residential things, they're actually prohibited.

2581
04:32:28,482 --> 04:32:30,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2582
04:32:30,579 --> 04:32:33,461
[SPEAKER_08]: I think most of us are in agreement that it should be allowed.

2583
04:32:33,481 --> 04:32:34,362
[SPEAKER_28]: It's allowed.

2584
04:32:34,522 --> 04:32:38,545
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, definitely.

2585
04:32:41,448 --> 04:32:46,692
[SPEAKER_14]: So, okay, so there seems to be agreement that it should be allowed.

2586
04:32:47,953 --> 04:32:52,217
[SPEAKER_14]: At least I'm just trying to identify areas of consensus, David, would you agree with that as well.

2587
04:32:52,577 --> 04:32:53,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I think we're talking about.

2588
04:32:54,919 --> 04:33:02,825
[SPEAKER_14]: allowing first floor commercial uses in the apartment one and apartment two area, not requires by special permit.

2589
04:33:03,986 --> 04:33:10,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Well that I think that's a separate issue I think I mean there's really three things so I just want to I want to understand that all three pieces of it.

2590
04:33:10,871 --> 04:33:17,956
[SPEAKER_14]: So one is the first floor commercial and I think we have consensus that allowing it rather than requiring it.

2591
04:33:18,760 --> 04:33:20,842
[SPEAKER_14]: to be appropriate in those districts.

2592
04:33:21,462 --> 04:33:29,768
[SPEAKER_14]: The second piece that I want to now get a sense of is the proposal moves in two different directions.

2593
04:33:30,529 --> 04:33:43,458
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes it harder on the one hand for residential multifamily development because it requires, instead of as of right, multifamily, it would make it a special permit.

2594
04:33:48,272 --> 04:33:50,113
[SPEAKER_14]: the commercial uses.

2595
04:33:51,073 --> 04:33:57,896
[SPEAKER_14]: So the question is whether folks support the movement to the special permit.

2596
04:34:01,878 --> 04:34:08,701
[SPEAKER_14]: So in apartment one, right now, multifamily up to three stories is allowed.

2597
04:34:09,481 --> 04:34:13,122
[SPEAKER_14]: In apartment two, multifamily up to six stories is allowed.

2598
04:34:13,783 --> 04:34:14,403
[SPEAKER_14]: I got that right.

2599
04:34:24,341 --> 04:34:40,446
[SPEAKER_15]: So the way this is drafted now, it would not allow multiple dwelling over six stories in height in apartment one, because the way it's drafted is just changing the word yes to SPC.

2600
04:34:41,166 --> 04:34:48,228
[SPEAKER_15]: So where it says no for multiple dwelling not over 75 feet or six stories in height for apartment one,

2601
04:34:48,870 --> 04:34:51,312
[SPEAKER_15]: the way it's currently drafted, that wouldn't change.

2602
04:34:53,194 --> 04:34:54,655
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, Alicia, you just confused me.

2603
04:34:54,695 --> 04:35:08,747
[SPEAKER_14]: So right now in apartment one, multiple dwelling units up to six stories in height is not allowed.

2604
04:35:09,748 --> 04:35:12,050
[SPEAKER_14]: And that doesn't change with the mayor's proposal.

2605
04:35:12,751 --> 04:35:14,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct, correct.

2606
04:35:15,057 --> 04:35:20,679
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's only apartment one is up to three stories, apartment two districts are up to six stories.

2607
04:35:21,519 --> 04:35:30,983
[SPEAKER_14]: But right now, those are as of right uses, and this proposal would change that to special permit.

2608
04:35:33,284 --> 04:35:33,664
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

2609
04:35:35,124 --> 04:35:35,445
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

2610
04:35:43,267 --> 04:35:44,628
[SPEAKER_21]: So are you saying that

2611
04:35:45,840 --> 04:35:57,349
[SPEAKER_21]: If someone wants to come in and build a three-story apartment building, they have to go, without commercial uses on the ground floor, they have to go through special permit with this change.

2612
04:35:58,310 --> 04:35:59,231
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not a right.

2613
04:35:59,871 --> 04:36:06,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, which is why I was saying maybe leave out apartment one and only do it for apartment two, which allows more density.

2614
04:36:09,187 --> 04:36:16,910
[SPEAKER_21]: Almost makes me think then to give people more density in apartment one if they put commercial use on the ground floor.

2615
04:36:18,871 --> 04:36:20,091
[SPEAKER_21]: Give them an extra floor.

2616
04:36:20,411 --> 04:36:20,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

2617
04:36:20,852 --> 04:36:24,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now on Salem Street, the entire thing is apartment one.

2618
04:36:36,726 --> 04:36:40,427
[SPEAKER_15]: And actually, I think if I'm correct, that's Main Street.

2619
04:36:40,587 --> 04:36:56,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Most of the Main Street that's not general residential, almost all of it is apartment one, except for the tiniest, the one block radius around Harvard Street, the part that people think of as South Medford's business district.

2620
04:36:57,750 --> 04:36:58,831
[SPEAKER_15]: That part's commercial.

2621
04:37:03,532 --> 04:37:05,832
[SPEAKER_15]: God, we really need to do a comprehensive plan.

2622
04:37:07,595 --> 04:37:11,917
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's try to land this.

2623
04:37:19,901 --> 04:37:29,186
[SPEAKER_14]: My thought is to move apartment two to go along with the special permit, but not require the first floor commercial.

2624
04:37:30,647 --> 04:37:37,050
[SPEAKER_14]: But in apartment one, only to

2625
04:37:40,822 --> 04:37:41,202
[SPEAKER_14]: It's hard.

2626
04:37:41,282 --> 04:37:46,743
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, honestly, I think there are parts of apartment one that just they're not appropriate for first floor commercial.

2627
04:37:46,843 --> 04:37:51,964
[SPEAKER_14]: And I mean, the neighbors would just would go crazy about it.

2628
04:37:52,324 --> 04:37:54,365
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really know how to thread the needle on that one.

2629
04:37:54,385 --> 04:37:56,645
[SPEAKER_14]: The fact is, we do need a comprehensive plan.

2630
04:37:56,705 --> 04:37:58,946
[SPEAKER_14]: We do need to look at these districts more carefully.

2631
04:37:59,626 --> 04:38:02,106
[SPEAKER_14]: And we need to figure out where commercial should go.

2632
04:38:02,186 --> 04:38:05,547
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't want to do something where, you know, there's a

2633
04:38:07,499 --> 04:38:18,085
[SPEAKER_14]: three-story home, you know, three family home on Riverside Ave suddenly has like a retail store, you know, in the middle of a row of homes.

2634
04:38:19,385 --> 04:38:23,468
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not sure, you know, how to, how to deal with that situation.

2635
04:38:23,488 --> 04:38:28,330
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess I would say that that's because that it's why it's special permit.

2636
04:38:28,851 --> 04:38:35,054
[SPEAKER_15]: And frankly, I think that those same people would go nuts because somebody's brought building a three-story apartment building.

2637
04:38:37,009 --> 04:38:37,590
[SPEAKER_17]: next to them.

2638
04:38:44,535 --> 04:38:49,519
[SPEAKER_18]: So Andre, why don't we just move forward then with recommending the districts that we feel comfortable with?

2639
04:38:53,081 --> 04:38:54,282
[SPEAKER_18]: The ones we're all in agreement on.

2640
04:38:55,563 --> 04:38:59,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, I'd like to know what what you guys think about apartment one and apartment two.

2641
04:39:00,026 --> 04:39:04,990
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems like there's some some concern, but we didn't quite.

2642
04:39:07,341 --> 04:39:10,122
[SPEAKER_14]: There seems to be support for allowing it.

2643
04:39:12,683 --> 04:39:18,005
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the question is special permit or not.

2644
04:39:18,125 --> 04:39:34,952
[SPEAKER_14]: So if folks want to give that discretion to the city council, or at least recommend that they have that discretion to review those projects and safeguard the community, then

2645
04:39:38,240 --> 04:39:39,061
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you feel about it?

2646
04:39:39,101 --> 04:39:44,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you feel, do you want to move forward on those districts or not?

2647
04:39:44,422 --> 04:39:46,763
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, this is just a recommendation for the city council.

2648
04:39:46,823 --> 04:39:52,704
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to do what they want to do with it, but maybe influenced by our recommendation.

2649
04:39:54,505 --> 04:40:04,968
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think this is the thing that's like kind of bugging me is that I feel like this, you know, one of the first things that Alicia said,

2650
04:40:06,032 --> 04:40:08,413
[SPEAKER_07]: when we talked about this last time is it's a stopgap.

2651
04:40:08,473 --> 04:40:14,916
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I was sort of saying with like the, that this seems way too intricate.

2652
04:40:14,956 --> 04:40:28,522
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think the spirit of this is that it's something that will halt the kind of development that's inappropriate in Medford for the short term.

2653
04:40:33,092 --> 04:40:35,133
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not gonna be perfect.

2654
04:40:35,173 --> 04:40:43,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the perfect answer here is not gonna happen with the people sitting at this table figuring it out.

2655
04:40:44,279 --> 04:40:46,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Professionals are gonna figure this out.

2656
04:40:46,500 --> 04:41:00,228
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're being asked to comment on whether we think it's appropriate to put into place some zoning which will

2657
04:41:02,927 --> 04:41:05,208
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of force the issue, in my opinion.

2658
04:41:08,049 --> 04:41:13,311
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, I think we could talk about this district and that, but to me, this isn't really about that.

2659
04:41:13,351 --> 04:41:21,355
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more about just like, we need to start thinking about this city and its zoning a little more seriously.

2660
04:41:21,375 --> 04:41:25,356
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's probably why the mayor is putting this in place.

2661
04:41:35,486 --> 04:41:53,333
[SPEAKER_07]: That said, I think the last thing I'll say is that, I mean, is it possible for us to say, we think this is a great idea in all the districts except the apartment districts and we don't have an opinion on the other or something like that?

2662
04:41:53,413 --> 04:41:53,794
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2663
04:41:54,294 --> 04:41:55,014
[SPEAKER_07]: We are just leaving.

2664
04:41:57,683 --> 04:42:01,647
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we could just keep it simple because we don't even know if they're going to write.

2665
04:42:01,667 --> 04:42:03,388
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't have anything anyway, right?

2666
04:42:03,408 --> 04:42:04,009
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have to.

2667
04:42:04,049 --> 04:42:05,230
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have to wordsmith it.

2668
04:42:05,270 --> 04:42:06,752
[SPEAKER_14]: We can basically just give up.

2669
04:42:07,753 --> 04:42:09,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, some principled recommendation.

2670
04:42:09,634 --> 04:42:10,595
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a recommendation.

2671
04:42:10,635 --> 04:42:15,840
[SPEAKER_07]: We like it for this district, this one and this one, and we don't have a comment about the others.

2672
04:42:16,241 --> 04:42:17,642
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, agreed.

2673
04:42:19,092 --> 04:42:22,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we already took care of C1 and MUZ.

2674
04:42:22,194 --> 04:42:29,297
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think the question now is whether we want to make some kind of recommendation or statement about apartment one and apartment two.

2675
04:42:29,717 --> 04:42:45,826
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it would probably make sense to say, we don't think the first floor commercial should be a requirement, but it should be allowed, but we'd like to see

2676
04:42:50,100 --> 04:42:55,325
[SPEAKER_14]: some more analysis of the districts, I think, or we'd like to see some.

2677
04:42:59,609 --> 04:43:05,375
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's too complex an issue for us to make a recommendation.

2678
04:43:06,776 --> 04:43:07,717
[SPEAKER_25]: Without further study.

2679
04:43:10,500 --> 04:43:10,700
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

2680
04:43:12,222 --> 04:43:12,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2681
04:43:12,622 --> 04:43:13,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion on the floor?

2682
04:43:20,823 --> 04:43:21,603
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll try this one.

2683
04:43:23,444 --> 04:43:40,450
[SPEAKER_21]: I make a motion to recommend to the city council that they keep the language as proposed for the zoning amendment to include ground first floor commercial uses in the C1 and mixed use zoning district.

2684
04:43:41,211 --> 04:43:43,912
[SPEAKER_14]: Although, Christy, we already did that motion, so you don't have to do that one.

2685
04:43:44,192 --> 04:43:46,133
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just apartment one and apartment two.

2686
04:43:47,557 --> 04:43:48,957
[SPEAKER_14]: She's saying it really nicely, though.

2687
04:43:48,977 --> 04:43:49,837
[SPEAKER_14]: She's doing such a wonderful job.

2688
04:43:49,857 --> 04:43:51,258
[SPEAKER_21]: I was crying really hard.

2689
04:43:53,538 --> 04:43:57,399
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate you stepping up.

2690
04:43:58,439 --> 04:44:11,402
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll make a motion to recommend on the apartment one and apartment two proposed zoning amendment for our first floor commercial use that we

2691
04:44:14,188 --> 04:44:24,895
[SPEAKER_21]: We recommend that it be allowed versus required, but there's really not much more that we can offer without further analysis of the district.

2692
04:44:24,975 --> 04:44:27,357
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I mean, is that what we're saying?

2693
04:44:27,377 --> 04:44:37,344
[SPEAKER_21]: Are we just not gonna provide a recommendation on those?

2694
04:44:39,245 --> 04:44:41,907
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's certainly a possibility.

2695
04:44:42,367 --> 04:44:43,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, I like that.

2696
04:44:46,845 --> 04:44:49,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Any disagreement or is there consensus around that?

2697
04:44:51,769 --> 04:44:52,069
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2698
04:44:53,651 --> 04:45:03,899
[SPEAKER_17]: So we don't need a motion unless there's a, do we need a motion to move on to the next agenda item?

2699
04:45:03,919 --> 04:45:06,561
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think so.

2700
04:45:13,326 --> 04:45:23,189
[SPEAKER_14]: Then let's move on to the next agenda item, which is a review for bond reduction and lot release requests from the Winthrop Place Definitive Subdivision at 25 Winthrop Place.

2701
04:45:25,470 --> 04:45:28,891
[SPEAKER_20]: Andrew, I think you missed the BJ's one.

2702
04:45:29,672 --> 04:45:30,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, oh boy.

2703
04:45:30,832 --> 04:45:31,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, sorry.

2704
04:45:31,412 --> 04:45:32,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my goodness.

2705
04:45:33,793 --> 04:45:36,794
[SPEAKER_14]: It must have been wishful thinking that we were further along.

2706
04:45:38,085 --> 04:45:44,933
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we have a continued public hearing for special permit site plan review application 278 Middlesex Avenue, BJ's Gas.

2707
04:45:45,994 --> 04:45:56,326
[SPEAKER_14]: And public hearing, this is a continuance of a public hearing from last time, from June 18th.

2708
04:45:57,218 --> 04:46:01,881
[SPEAKER_14]: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on Thursday, June 18th, 2020, 6.45 p.m.

2709
04:46:02,041 --> 04:46:18,153
[SPEAKER_14]: via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to a special permit site plan review application submitted by BJ's Wholesale Club to construct a self-service fueling station within a portion of the existing parking area at 278 and Zero Middlesex Avenue and allow use in an industrial zoning district.

2710
04:46:18,493 --> 04:46:23,617
[SPEAKER_14]: The site is currently occupied by an existing BJ's Wholesale Club with associated surface parking and site improvements.

2711
04:46:24,117 --> 04:46:36,843
[SPEAKER_14]: The proposed facility will be comprised of a 200 plus or minus square foot kiosk gasoline attendant facility with canopy, 4,525 plus or minus square feet, and a six dispenser service pump island.

2712
04:46:37,223 --> 04:46:50,729
[SPEAKER_14]: A copy of the application may be viewed in the office of community development room 308 or on the city's website at www.medfordma.org slash department slash community hyphen development by clicking on current CD board filings.

2713
04:46:53,783 --> 04:47:00,588
[SPEAKER_14]: pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law, we are conducting this hearing digitally.

2714
04:47:02,929 --> 04:47:03,189
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2715
04:47:03,229 --> 04:47:11,135
[SPEAKER_14]: We have the applicant we'd like to invite to make a presentation and update us about where things stand.

2716
04:47:12,956 --> 04:47:15,038
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, good evening, Mr. Chairman.

2717
04:47:15,478 --> 04:47:19,981
[SPEAKER_24]: For the record, Mark Vaughn with the law firm of Riemer and Braunstein representing the applicant.

2718
04:47:20,001 --> 04:47:21,382
[SPEAKER_24]: Can you hear me okay?

2719
04:47:21,882 --> 04:47:22,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Mark, thank you.

2720
04:47:24,762 --> 04:47:34,524
[SPEAKER_24]: Pleasure to be before you this evening and really been watching the board the past several hours and I don't envy the job that you do.

2721
04:47:34,564 --> 04:47:36,144
[SPEAKER_24]: You do a wonderful job for this.

2722
04:47:36,324 --> 04:47:45,426
[SPEAKER_24]: So I wanted to just spare you a detailed presentation as you're approaching our, what looks like it's our number five, if you're hearing here.

2723
04:47:46,046 --> 04:47:50,387
[SPEAKER_24]: I know we had a pretty detailed summary presented at the last meeting.

2724
04:47:50,982 --> 04:48:05,945
[SPEAKER_24]: of what the project involves, but we're talking about the BJ's location at 278 Middlesex Avenue, where BJ's is looking to incorporate a gas facility within their existing parking field.

2725
04:48:06,925 --> 04:48:09,906
[SPEAKER_24]: There'd be no additional pavement proposed.

2726
04:48:09,986 --> 04:48:12,466
[SPEAKER_24]: Everything would be within the existing paved area.

2727
04:48:12,966 --> 04:48:20,628
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a surplus parking area that they feel would be ideally used for this use, which they've incorporated.

2728
04:48:21,543 --> 04:48:24,184
[SPEAKER_24]: many of their other BJ's locations.

2729
04:48:25,045 --> 04:48:30,167
[SPEAKER_24]: Just to remind the board, this would be limited to BJ's customers only.

2730
04:48:30,988 --> 04:48:32,949
[SPEAKER_24]: This is not open to the general public.

2731
04:48:33,029 --> 04:48:35,810
[SPEAKER_24]: It would be limited to BJ's customers only.

2732
04:48:36,511 --> 04:48:40,973
[SPEAKER_24]: And there would not be any service of vehicles or convenience store or anything like that.

2733
04:48:40,993 --> 04:48:42,874
[SPEAKER_24]: The kiosk that's there just simply

2734
04:48:44,018 --> 04:48:53,986
[SPEAKER_24]: as an attendant in it, and the only commercial activity, if you would, that could take place there would be someone that might be needing to renew a membership card or something like that.

2735
04:48:54,106 --> 04:48:59,310
[SPEAKER_24]: So in our first meeting, we obviously spent a lot of time focusing on the project.

2736
04:48:59,330 --> 04:49:12,500
[SPEAKER_24]: There was a lot of valuable feedback that we got in terms of things for us to look at as a team and get back to the board on with hopefully some answers and some further analysis.

2737
04:49:13,803 --> 04:49:17,566
[SPEAKER_24]: And we feel that we've been able to do that.

2738
04:49:17,666 --> 04:49:30,876
[SPEAKER_24]: We did submit a communication today, Mr. Chairman, with a couple of response letters to the city engineering staff responding to a number of comments that were raised previously.

2739
04:49:31,356 --> 04:49:34,719
[SPEAKER_24]: We also did submit a response letter to

2740
04:49:36,552 --> 04:49:48,462
[SPEAKER_24]: the law firm of Anderson and Krieger that represents the two commercial property owners across the street, the gas station across the street and the car wash and some other Medford residents.

2741
04:49:48,482 --> 04:49:53,767
[SPEAKER_24]: So we did respond to that as well and submitted that to the board.

2742
04:49:54,659 --> 04:50:06,720
[SPEAKER_24]: Over the past few weeks, we've spent a lot of time having further dialogue with city planning staff, both Alicia and Annie, appreciate the time that it took to meet with us to kind of drill down on a few of these items.

2743
04:50:07,674 --> 04:50:20,263
[SPEAKER_24]: and also city engineering staff to talk about some of the traffic and other enhancements that we might be able to do kind of outside of the property limits, if you would.

2744
04:50:20,924 --> 04:50:35,715
[SPEAKER_24]: And we did share a couple of concept plans with the board that shows, you know, some, I'm going to turn it over to our traffic engineer, Sean Kelly and Austin Turner, who's with Bowler.

2745
04:50:36,742 --> 04:50:39,524
[SPEAKER_24]: rather than my repeating what they're about to say.

2746
04:50:39,584 --> 04:50:53,392
[SPEAKER_24]: But I think the focus has been for us to look at some pedestrian enhancements, additional landscaping that we could provide, even though we're already providing a significant amount of new landscaping with their opportunities to provide even more.

2747
04:50:53,932 --> 04:51:05,079
[SPEAKER_24]: And then on the traffic front, how we might be able to address some additional pedestrian safety enhancements along Middlesex Ave and some ADA accessibility enhancements.

2748
04:51:06,738 --> 04:51:20,603
[SPEAKER_24]: any opportunities to modify that curb opening for the driveway, and further dialogue with MassDOT about the complete streets program and some things that we might be able to explore there.

2749
04:51:21,003 --> 04:51:28,206
[SPEAKER_24]: So if I could, I'd like to ask Sean Kelly with Van Assen Associates, our traffic engineer, to

2750
04:51:29,793 --> 04:51:32,194
[SPEAKER_24]: maybe speak to one of the exhibit plans.

2751
04:51:32,274 --> 04:51:38,976
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know who might be able to pull that up, but he can speak a little bit more in depth on that.

2752
04:51:39,096 --> 04:51:40,156
[SPEAKER_24]: So, thank you.

2753
04:51:41,177 --> 04:51:41,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mark.

2754
04:51:42,517 --> 04:51:44,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, Mr. Chairman and members of the board.

2755
04:51:44,257 --> 04:51:48,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, for the record, Sean Kelly, we have an app, associates, half the team.

2756
04:51:48,919 --> 04:51:50,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you again for having us before you tonight.

2757
04:51:51,280 --> 04:51:58,662
[SPEAKER_02]: If it pleases the board, I know it's, it'll take a few minutes to kind of give you an update on some of the meetings and discussions we've had both with the

2758
04:51:59,823 --> 04:52:03,707
[SPEAKER_02]: City Engineer, Tim McGivern in the city traffic engineer Todd Blake.

2759
04:52:04,688 --> 04:52:11,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for meeting with us and reviewing the project, then some additional course subsequent to that meeting.

2760
04:52:12,882 --> 04:52:40,780
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did meet with Tim and Todd, and we reviewed the project and some of the concerns, and I won't speak for the city staff, but certainly the focus at our meeting was, although this project was primarily vehicular in nature, was looking at the pedestrian and bicycle accommodations, both on the site that served the site, as well as the internal of the site itself, and ways to make the site more accommodating for other users, not just vehicular traffic.

2761
04:52:42,047 --> 04:52:45,089
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked at the rear access onto Felsway.

2762
04:52:45,889 --> 04:52:49,050
[SPEAKER_02]: The Felsway corridor has recently been upgraded by DCR.

2763
04:52:49,070 --> 04:52:50,631
[SPEAKER_02]: They've restriped it.

2764
04:52:50,691 --> 04:52:54,113
[SPEAKER_02]: They now have exclusive bicycle lanes that are buffered from the travel lane.

2765
04:52:55,073 --> 04:53:05,378
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have sidewalk along our frontage, but what they did point out is that the ramps and the crossing today for the Delta Island, they don't meet current ADA design guidelines with respect to

2766
04:53:06,418 --> 04:53:09,339
[SPEAKER_02]: the design of the wheelchair ramps, the lack of detectable panels.

2767
04:53:09,980 --> 04:53:16,722
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a request to work with DCR to improve those, to meet the current standards.

2768
04:53:16,762 --> 04:53:19,143
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're committed to doing that.

2769
04:53:19,383 --> 04:53:21,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see DCR having any issue with us bringing it up to standards.

2770
04:53:21,884 --> 04:53:26,066
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something that we've made a commitment to, and we've addressed that in our response letter.

2771
04:53:27,753 --> 04:53:31,395
[SPEAKER_02]: We also looked at the access from Middlesex Avenue.

2772
04:53:31,876 --> 04:53:39,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, some of the same themes played through at that access point, the lack of a crosswalk at that location, the lack of wheelchair ramps.

2773
04:53:40,521 --> 04:53:47,486
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some discussions about the width of the driveway, where there is a pedestrian crossing there, and whether there was anything we could do to modify that.

2774
04:53:48,226 --> 04:53:55,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let Austin Turner from Bowler speak more directly to the site plan modifications, but that was something we also took a look at as well.

2775
04:53:56,392 --> 04:54:03,079
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think probably the biggest question was, could we look at the Middlesex Avenue corridor itself?

2776
04:54:03,159 --> 04:54:05,181
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fairly wide corridor.

2777
04:54:05,221 --> 04:54:09,305
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 38 to 40 feet wide for most of the stretch within the city of Medford.

2778
04:54:10,066 --> 04:54:16,192
[SPEAKER_02]: And in some areas, Todd was looking to have exclusive bicycle lanes put in both northbound and southbound.

2779
04:54:17,173 --> 04:54:20,274
[SPEAKER_02]: In some areas, have a shoulder mark with sheriffs.

2780
04:54:21,514 --> 04:54:27,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Subsequent to our meeting with the city staff, we did have a meeting with District 4 traffic and engineering to review these measures.

2781
04:54:28,757 --> 04:54:38,520
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they've asked us to do is essentially prepare a conceptual improvement plan that would show the limits of the striping, which essentially would be from the city line at the plaza.

2782
04:54:39,100 --> 04:54:46,484
[SPEAKER_02]: across from Wendy's, it would run down to First Street with striped exclusive bicycle lanes buffered from the travel lane with a painted gore.

2783
04:54:46,504 --> 04:54:50,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from First Street heading south, a shoulder with sharrows.

2784
04:54:50,946 --> 04:54:53,247
[SPEAKER_02]: We've reviewed it briefly with DOT.

2785
04:54:53,367 --> 04:55:01,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, they want to see a planning review in more detail, but we've made a commitment to put together that conceptual design and submit it to the state for review.

2786
04:55:01,971 --> 04:55:21,773
[SPEAKER_02]: If DOT who has jurisdictional along the corridor is in agreement, we've agreed that we'll either implement those measures ourselves and actually strike the lanes, or we will provide a financial monetary contribution to the city so that they could implement that measure as part of a larger planning effort.

2787
04:55:23,755 --> 04:55:26,297
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really where we are right now.

2788
04:55:27,638 --> 04:55:48,096
[SPEAKER_02]: We've met with the city staff, we understand their concerns, and really, again, even though this is primarily a vehicular project, I think in the context of the overall BJ site, the goal for the city is to improve the pedestrian realm and improve the bicyclist realm, and we're committed to implementing those measures as long as we can get the appropriate sign-offs from the relevant state agencies.

2789
04:55:49,974 --> 04:56:11,888
[SPEAKER_02]: At the meeting, at the last meeting, there was also some discussion about parking and the concern that the elimination of the parking spaces at the front end where we're proposing to have the gas station would ultimately potentially have some adverse impacts if we didn't have enough parking, essentially, for all of the customers and employees at the existing BJ's Wholesale Club.

2790
04:56:12,692 --> 04:56:25,195
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as part of our initial session we hadn't done a complete parking assessment you know we built the site number of times during peak hours and, and quite frankly, you really don't see any vehicles parked up in that section where we wanted to the gas station.

2791
04:56:25,215 --> 04:56:36,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at historical imagery from going back number of years you'll tell the same story the parking is really towards the front of the store the demand really doesn't filter into that front parking field but

2792
04:56:37,317 --> 04:56:42,440
[SPEAKER_02]: We felt it was important to do a full parking analysis to address this issue head on.

2793
04:56:42,500 --> 04:56:48,903
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went out, we typically would do a parking analysis for the evening and the Saturday.

2794
04:56:48,943 --> 04:56:50,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the busiest times.

2795
04:56:51,024 --> 04:57:04,111
[SPEAKER_02]: We did do the evening and the Saturday, but I know that the opposition had also raised some concern about BJ's policy of allowing first responders and elderly, the most vulnerable members of the community to do their shopping in the morning hours.

2796
04:57:04,151 --> 04:57:06,032
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to address that comment as well.

2797
04:57:07,012 --> 04:57:14,658
[SPEAKER_02]: We went out and did some parking demand and quite frankly the demand was fairly low relative to the parking that's available.

2798
04:57:15,258 --> 04:57:25,325
[SPEAKER_02]: In the morning we saw about 60 vehicles park there on the whole site, 61 in fact, in the evening it was about 120, and then on the Saturday midday was about 150.

2799
04:57:27,239 --> 04:57:36,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Putting that into context, even with the elimination of the parking that will be utilized by the fueling facility, we're still going to have 330 parking spaces.

2800
04:57:36,403 --> 04:57:45,948
[SPEAKER_02]: And the maximum demand that we observed again during that Saturday was 150, which still leaves us with, you know, 180 surplus spaces during that busy Saturday hour.

2801
04:57:46,588 --> 04:57:49,731
[SPEAKER_02]: In the morning, it's almost 270 spaces.

2802
04:57:49,771 --> 04:57:59,842
[SPEAKER_02]: So clearly, the parking demand study demonstrates that there's more than adequate supply, even with the elimination of the field that would be utilized for the fueling facility.

2803
04:58:00,703 --> 04:58:04,584
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really kind of a summary of where we are right now.

2804
04:58:04,604 --> 04:58:11,646
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna continue to work with MassDOT and advance the bicycle plan, look to get their support.

2805
04:58:11,686 --> 04:58:23,049
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, if they're in board with it and they think it's a good idea, we're certainly willing to work with the city to either implement that measure or provide the financial contribution that the city can do it themselves as part of a larger project.

2806
04:58:24,138 --> 04:58:26,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I think with that, I'll turn it over to Austin.

2807
04:58:26,439 --> 04:58:30,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's some pedestrian accommodations within the site itself that we'd like to review.

2808
04:58:31,882 --> 04:58:32,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2809
04:58:33,843 --> 04:58:34,103
[SPEAKER_32]: Sure.

2810
04:58:34,544 --> 04:58:38,106
[SPEAKER_32]: Good evening, everybody, or good night, I guess, as the case may be at this point.

2811
04:58:38,746 --> 04:58:41,387
[SPEAKER_32]: Annie, I was wondering if you could allow me to share my screen.

2812
04:58:41,407 --> 04:58:44,309
[SPEAKER_32]: I had a couple of exhibits that might help facilitate the conversation.

2813
04:58:45,710 --> 04:58:46,030
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

2814
04:58:46,110 --> 04:58:47,030
[SPEAKER_20]: Hold on one moment.

2815
04:58:47,671 --> 04:58:47,911
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

2816
04:58:57,869 --> 04:58:58,729
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, you should be good.

2817
04:58:59,710 --> 04:59:01,011
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, let's give it a go here.

2818
04:59:07,094 --> 04:59:09,955
[SPEAKER_32]: Let me know, I'm sharing, let me know when that pops up, please.

2819
04:59:11,756 --> 04:59:12,817
[SPEAKER_32]: Yep, we got it.

2820
04:59:14,782 --> 04:59:20,324
[SPEAKER_32]: So what I'm going to do is, you know, Sean did a good job of summarizing kind of some of the off-site stuff.

2821
04:59:20,384 --> 04:59:29,447
[SPEAKER_32]: And what I wanted to do is kind of show you what that looks like graphically and also talk about some of the things that we've incorporated subsequent to our initial discussion.

2822
04:59:30,667 --> 04:59:36,669
[SPEAKER_32]: First and foremost is if you're looking at the top of my page and kind of where my cursor is tracing,

2823
04:59:37,643 --> 04:59:48,746
[SPEAKER_32]: You'll see what we're doing here is we're incorporating a pedestrian connection from Middlesex Avenue and the existing sidewalk along Middlesex Avenue all the way to the front of the club.

2824
04:59:50,026 --> 05:00:00,268
[SPEAKER_32]: We had talked about that at length at the last discussion and we spent a lot of time figuring out what's gonna be the most efficient path and how that could in fact be accomplished here.

2825
05:00:00,368 --> 05:00:06,950
[SPEAKER_32]: So what we've done is shown that sidewalk connection and what it's doing essentially is running

2826
05:00:08,370 --> 05:00:16,613
[SPEAKER_32]: the existing curb edge, you can see that in fact we're going to be actually adding some additional landscaping that's identified by that green hatch there.

2827
05:00:17,273 --> 05:00:20,034
[SPEAKER_32]: But that sidewalk essentially runs up along that part of the property.

2828
05:00:20,554 --> 05:00:26,576
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not invasive operationally to the gas station, it keeps it out of the inbound queue and it keeps it on the perimeter.

2829
05:00:27,176 --> 05:00:30,418
[SPEAKER_32]: And it also provides a linear path to the front of the club.

2830
05:00:32,404 --> 05:00:32,985
[SPEAKER_32]: It's efficient.

2831
05:00:33,345 --> 05:00:39,248
[SPEAKER_32]: It accomplishes the goal of providing that pedestrian connection directly to the front where there is none today.

2832
05:00:39,268 --> 05:00:43,491
[SPEAKER_32]: And it also actually allows us to provide some additional green space.

2833
05:00:44,051 --> 05:00:47,454
[SPEAKER_32]: It does reduce the parking a little bit.

2834
05:00:47,514 --> 05:00:49,895
[SPEAKER_32]: I think it's approximately nine or 10 spaces.

2835
05:00:49,935 --> 05:00:55,198
[SPEAKER_32]: You can kind of see it, the remnants of it on the aerial there, which they're parallel spots.

2836
05:00:55,278 --> 05:01:00,522
[SPEAKER_32]: And frankly, they're not utilized spaces and really not valuable parking.

2837
05:01:01,583 --> 05:01:08,348
[SPEAKER_32]: will still be in exceedance of the minimum zoning requirement with the inclusion of this sidewalk.

2838
05:01:08,468 --> 05:01:10,650
[SPEAKER_32]: And we think that is a good add, frankly.

2839
05:01:10,810 --> 05:01:13,592
[SPEAKER_32]: And it addresses the comment of the pedestrian connectivity.

2840
05:01:15,433 --> 05:01:20,397
[SPEAKER_32]: Another thing, and kind of in the same vein, I have a graphic that I will show you in a second.

2841
05:01:23,566 --> 05:01:39,371
[SPEAKER_32]: We are committed, as Sean mentioned, to rebuilding the sidewalks along the properties frontage on Middlesex Avenue, incorporating a crosswalk, and creating some additional accessibility improvements to that stretch as well.

2842
05:01:40,131 --> 05:01:47,854
[SPEAKER_32]: With that, and I'll show you a graphic in a second, with that comes, we were able to reduce the width of the driveway too, and that's going to be part of this proposal.

2843
05:01:48,835 --> 05:02:12,206
[SPEAKER_32]: It's we're at its peak and you'll see the graphic in a second I think we can get about approximately six or seven feet of a reduced width Of that that tapers and it varies a little bit just based on the nature of of the curvature and the radius point But we did take a look at some of the turning movements in there and there wasn't a tremendous amount of room but there was a little bit of room and we heard that as being an important thing to the board and I

2844
05:02:12,935 --> 05:02:18,578
[SPEAKER_32]: the community and decided, you know, that was an easy one for us to accommodate after taking a closer look at it.

2845
05:02:20,559 --> 05:02:34,307
[SPEAKER_32]: Sean did mention as well that we are looking on the Middlesex Avenue corridor as incorporating some of the complete streets initiatives that had been discussed, and we spent a fair amount of time talking with the city engineer and your city traffic engineer about that.

2846
05:02:35,175 --> 05:02:51,200
[SPEAKER_32]: So the applicant is committed to either implementing those directly, provided MassDOT is amenable to that, or funding that in an appropriate contribution to a much larger initiative that the city has to that complete streets program.

2847
05:02:52,260 --> 05:02:56,201
[SPEAKER_32]: Either way, what the applicant is doing is going to be participating in that.

2848
05:02:56,761 --> 05:02:58,482
[SPEAKER_32]: We heard that as being important as well.

2849
05:03:00,670 --> 05:03:19,363
[SPEAKER_32]: What we also did, and not necessarily related to the fueling facility, but just in terms of enhancing the green space landscaping and screening for the property, you can see on this rendering that there are additional landscaping features which are being incorporated, particularly along the front of the club.

2850
05:03:19,944 --> 05:03:27,309
[SPEAKER_32]: We're gonna be putting additional shade trees in there and ground cover plantings in the islands that are proximate to Woodruff Avenue.

2851
05:03:27,909 --> 05:03:28,930
[SPEAKER_32]: And then I think, you know,

2852
05:03:29,710 --> 05:03:35,525
[SPEAKER_32]: equally or perhaps even most importantly, you can see this dense stretch of vegetation that we're incorporating.

2853
05:03:36,701 --> 05:03:37,942
[SPEAKER_32]: along these parking spaces.

2854
05:03:38,322 --> 05:03:46,368
[SPEAKER_32]: And really, as we were investigating this further and thought, okay, where can we get the most value in terms of landscaping?

2855
05:03:47,168 --> 05:03:59,356
[SPEAKER_32]: This area, it stood out quite significantly because there's either vegetation there that isn't thriving or there's large gaps in the vegetation there and the screening fence is what remains.

2856
05:04:00,357 --> 05:04:03,099
[SPEAKER_32]: So what we're proposing here and what's gonna be incorporated

2857
05:04:03,974 --> 05:04:24,020
[SPEAKER_32]: as part of the plan, provided the board thinks it's worthwhile, would be additional plantings that are either shade trees or evergreen plantings or a combination of, to really enhance that buffer and really screen that further and provide some additional visual attenuation for that parking area.

2858
05:04:25,100 --> 05:04:26,801
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that's a good add, frankly.

2859
05:04:26,901 --> 05:04:29,822
[SPEAKER_32]: And there is some vegetation in there that appears to have been

2860
05:04:32,768 --> 05:04:33,608
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not thriving.

2861
05:04:33,628 --> 05:04:41,611
[SPEAKER_32]: It looks like there have been some recent utility work in there that may have compromised the root systems or something to those trees, and they're not doing very well.

2862
05:04:41,771 --> 05:04:49,254
[SPEAKER_32]: And so the idea here would be to really enhance that buffer system and replenish it and make it much denser than it currently is.

2863
05:04:50,375 --> 05:04:56,737
[SPEAKER_32]: So I had teased a graphic for the driveway in Middlesex.

2864
05:04:57,698 --> 05:05:01,139
[SPEAKER_32]: And if you can see, this graphic here just kind of blows up the intersection a little bit.

2865
05:05:02,041 --> 05:05:07,983
[SPEAKER_32]: And what we're proposing, as I've mentioned, is the reconstruction of the sidewalk along the property frontage.

2866
05:05:08,763 --> 05:05:12,904
[SPEAKER_32]: A reduction in the width of the driveway, which you can kind of see by this green arc.

2867
05:05:12,984 --> 05:05:19,745
[SPEAKER_32]: So what was pavement there is being hatched as green because we would re-landscape that area.

2868
05:05:20,546 --> 05:05:25,087
[SPEAKER_32]: We would formally stripe the crosswalk along this driveway.

2869
05:05:25,795 --> 05:05:40,220
[SPEAKER_32]: And then again, reconstruct the accessible ramps and put in the current and modern pedestrian accommodations there, detectable warnings and things of that nature to bring it into current compliance.

2870
05:05:41,568 --> 05:05:49,231
[SPEAKER_32]: I went through a fair amount there fairly quickly in terms of some of the new things that we're committing to on the property.

2871
05:05:49,251 --> 05:05:56,393
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd be happy to answer any questions or explore these in some additional detail as the board would prefer.

2872
05:06:00,267 --> 05:06:10,370
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's been a long evening for folks, and I appreciate both the responsiveness of the applicant on all of that in your presentation, as well as everybody else who's stuck around.

2873
05:06:10,450 --> 05:06:19,513
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's, before we get to board discussion, let's take a public comment.

2874
05:06:20,554 --> 05:06:21,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Annie, can you help me with that?

2875
05:06:29,697 --> 05:06:31,579
[SPEAKER_20]: Jessica Wall, you should be unmuted.

2876
05:06:33,120 --> 05:06:33,841
[SPEAKER_33]: Great, thank you.

2877
05:06:33,861 --> 05:06:34,942
[SPEAKER_33]: Can everybody hear me okay?

2878
05:06:35,663 --> 05:06:35,883
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2879
05:06:36,804 --> 05:06:37,745
[SPEAKER_33]: Excellent, thank you.

2880
05:06:38,546 --> 05:06:39,987
[SPEAKER_33]: Good evening, Jessica Wall.

2881
05:06:40,028 --> 05:06:41,569
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm an attorney at Anderson and Krieger.

2882
05:06:42,310 --> 05:06:44,672
[SPEAKER_33]: For the record, that's 50 Milk Street in Boston.

2883
05:06:44,692 --> 05:06:49,157
[SPEAKER_33]: I want to thank the board for the opportunity to provide further comment tonight.

2884
05:06:50,659 --> 05:07:01,531
[SPEAKER_33]: I represent two of the property owners across the street on Middlesex Avenue at 273 and 277, and then also a group of Wellington residents to the south of the proposed development.

2885
05:07:02,090 --> 05:07:03,171
[SPEAKER_33]: So I'll keep it brief.

2886
05:07:03,231 --> 05:07:07,453
[SPEAKER_33]: I know it's been a long evening for a lot of folks.

2887
05:07:07,493 --> 05:07:16,857
[SPEAKER_33]: Just to provide a brief recap, in June, before the board's last hearing, we submitted a comment letter highlighting some of the concerns that we had about the project, including traffic.

2888
05:07:17,337 --> 05:07:24,761
[SPEAKER_33]: That had some analysis, or the traffic analysis there was supported by Green International Associates by Bill Scully.

2889
05:07:25,561 --> 05:07:29,883
[SPEAKER_33]: Since that meeting, we've provided a second comment letter from a second traffic engineer

2890
05:07:30,648 --> 05:07:32,430
[SPEAKER_33]: Stephen Ellman from Venetian Company.

2891
05:07:33,011 --> 05:07:34,132
[SPEAKER_33]: And Stephen's here tonight.

2892
05:07:34,192 --> 05:07:41,159
[SPEAKER_33]: I think he has a few brief words that he'd like to say to outline some of his thoughts on the project and what's outlined in that comment letter.

2893
05:07:41,740 --> 05:07:50,169
[SPEAKER_33]: Stephen has over 40 years of experience as a traffic engineer and also traffic engineering experience particular to gas station uses.

2894
05:07:50,700 --> 05:07:55,063
[SPEAKER_33]: So we thought that that additional specific insight would be useful for the board.

2895
05:07:55,983 --> 05:07:58,985
[SPEAKER_33]: So Steven is here tonight and can go through some of those notes.

2896
05:07:59,685 --> 05:08:10,551
[SPEAKER_33]: I just want to note also, we understand, and I think the applicant mentioned, that they had included or filed recently, either today or yesterday, new plans and a new set of documents.

2897
05:08:10,792 --> 05:08:20,317
[SPEAKER_33]: So we haven't had much time to sort of digest those and understand or raise potential concerns that those might flag for us for the board.

2898
05:08:20,950 --> 05:08:28,976
[SPEAKER_33]: So Steve and I think we'll touch upon some of those issues, but we reserve the right to provide further comments, if possible, to the board on those issues.

2899
05:08:29,956 --> 05:08:35,820
[SPEAKER_33]: So if the chair will allow, I'll turn it over to Stephen Ullman, who can explain some of his findings.

2900
05:08:36,881 --> 05:08:37,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2901
05:08:38,342 --> 05:08:38,823
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2902
05:08:39,463 --> 05:08:39,903
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome.

2903
05:08:40,984 --> 05:08:41,484
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Ullman?

2904
05:08:42,885 --> 05:08:43,366
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

2905
05:08:43,646 --> 05:08:44,747
[SPEAKER_26]: My name is Steve Ullman.

2906
05:08:45,347 --> 05:08:47,509
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm a professional engineer in Massachusetts.

2907
05:08:47,649 --> 05:08:49,350
[SPEAKER_26]: I work with Alfred Benition Company.

2908
05:08:49,938 --> 05:08:55,361
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm in the Glastonbury office at 120 Hebron Avenue in Glastonbury, Connecticut.

2909
05:08:55,682 --> 05:08:59,304
[SPEAKER_26]: We also have an office at 50 Redfield Street in Boston.

2910
05:09:00,665 --> 05:09:08,750
[SPEAKER_26]: I reviewed the study and the materials presented by the applicant, and let me read you, and I provided a letter dated Monday.

2911
05:09:09,730 --> 05:09:12,054
[SPEAKER_26]: for Tuesday on this.

2912
05:09:12,074 --> 05:09:14,919
[SPEAKER_26]: Let me read you my conclusion to summarize it.

2913
05:09:15,259 --> 05:09:23,793
[SPEAKER_26]: In my opinion, the BJ's traffic study in its present form does not accurately represent the potential traffic impacts from the proposed gas facility.

2914
05:09:24,933 --> 05:09:42,919
[SPEAKER_26]: With the traffic information currently provided and the site as currently designed, we do not believe that the board can find that the proposed development facility can operate safely or the proposed development will not negatively impact the traffic operations on the roadways surrounding the site.

2915
05:09:43,920 --> 05:09:48,721
[SPEAKER_26]: I have five or six major issues I take with their study.

2916
05:09:49,442 --> 05:09:53,423
[SPEAKER_26]: First, the trip generation for the site is not representative

2917
05:09:54,141 --> 05:09:57,722
[SPEAKER_26]: for wholesale clubs selling gasoline at below market rates.

2918
05:09:58,803 --> 05:10:03,244
[SPEAKER_26]: The use of a 50% capture rate is not justified, internal capture rate.

2919
05:10:04,165 --> 05:10:09,486
[SPEAKER_26]: The use of a 25% bypass seems high combined with the capture rate.

2920
05:10:11,087 --> 05:10:20,310
[SPEAKER_26]: There have been modified default values in the analysis that have been changed without real providing backup.

2921
05:10:20,730 --> 05:10:21,831
[SPEAKER_26]: They've stated that they've

2922
05:10:22,689 --> 05:10:24,569
[SPEAKER_26]: why they did it, but they don't have any backup.

2923
05:10:25,670 --> 05:10:34,752
[SPEAKER_26]: They have not shown the sight lines available on either roadway, no sight triangles on the plans, and the site layout cannot work safely.

2924
05:10:36,312 --> 05:10:44,114
[SPEAKER_26]: First on the trip generation, as you know, and they stated that they use the ITE trip generation for gasoline station.

2925
05:10:45,075 --> 05:10:50,176
[SPEAKER_26]: That is for a general generic gasoline station like the mobile station across the street.

2926
05:10:51,175 --> 05:10:52,756
[SPEAKER_26]: BJ's is a wholesale club.

2927
05:10:53,316 --> 05:11:04,624
[SPEAKER_26]: BJ's will sell gas at below market rates, 8 to 10 cents below market rates, and that will drive more traffic to the site.

2928
05:11:05,724 --> 05:11:12,108
[SPEAKER_26]: I was party to a review of a Costco up in Colchester, Vermont.

2929
05:11:12,869 --> 05:11:14,410
[SPEAKER_26]: That Costco study

2930
05:11:15,501 --> 05:11:29,429
[SPEAKER_26]: used trip generation rates for 12 position fueling stations that Costco operates, and they found that for the PM peak hour, their sites will generate 350 trips.

2931
05:11:30,290 --> 05:11:37,794
[SPEAKER_26]: That's more than double what the normal ITE trip generation rate would be for a 12 position fueling station.

2932
05:11:40,916 --> 05:11:44,378
[SPEAKER_26]: And what I find troublesome is that BJ's has

2933
05:11:45,292 --> 05:12:09,243
[SPEAKER_26]: several stations in New England and in the Boston area that provides gas to members only with 12 fueling positions that they could obtain data and generate their own custom trip generation to validate the ITE or what my findings have found that they're going to generate traffic at a much higher rate.

2934
05:12:10,604 --> 05:12:12,565
[SPEAKER_26]: The second part is the internal capture.

2935
05:12:13,690 --> 05:12:22,092
[SPEAKER_26]: Internal capture is those trips that are going to BJ's anyway, but we're going to buy gas too now.

2936
05:12:23,172 --> 05:12:26,313
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, we're going shopping on a Saturday morning, miles to buy gas.

2937
05:12:26,773 --> 05:12:28,754
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's not a new trip to the gas station.

2938
05:12:30,154 --> 05:12:32,875
[SPEAKER_26]: Their studies and BJ's own numbers.

2939
05:12:32,975 --> 05:12:40,437
[SPEAKER_26]: So they have the numbers for the fueling stations state that 30% internal capture rate is seen at stations with.

2940
05:12:41,710 --> 05:12:46,433
[SPEAKER_26]: gas stations that sell gas to members and the general public.

2941
05:12:47,534 --> 05:12:55,920
[SPEAKER_26]: Why they didn't use data from fueling stations that sell only to members when they have that data available, I don't understand why they did it.

2942
05:12:56,941 --> 05:12:58,842
[SPEAKER_26]: And they can provide that data.

2943
05:13:01,244 --> 05:13:06,428
[SPEAKER_26]: I will note that the Costco stations that I studied, they found that internal capture rate was only 32%.

2944
05:13:06,468 --> 05:13:06,708
[SPEAKER_26]: Pass by.

2945
05:13:10,816 --> 05:13:29,602
[SPEAKER_26]: Pass by is the traffic that is on the roadway adjacent to the facility that is normally driving to and from home or work or wherever they're going and just on a spur of the moment or for whatever reason, decide to pull into the gas station.

2946
05:13:29,622 --> 05:13:36,365
[SPEAKER_26]: Now that is not a new trip to the roadway network, but it is a new trip to the driveway.

2947
05:13:36,445 --> 05:13:37,185
[SPEAKER_26]: That's important.

2948
05:13:38,078 --> 05:13:48,164
[SPEAKER_26]: because when they did their trip generation and their distribution of traffic, they reduced the volumes of the driveway by that pass-by reduction.

2949
05:13:48,964 --> 05:13:50,285
[SPEAKER_26]: Plus they've used a 25% pass-by reduction.

2950
05:13:52,996 --> 05:14:07,147
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, gas stations selling to general public, like the gas station across the street or any other gas station in town, generate a large percentage of their trips by pass-by, people going to and from work, to the doctor, whatever.

2951
05:14:07,827 --> 05:14:17,875
[SPEAKER_26]: However, since this is for members only and they've already taken a credit for internal capture, we have a hard time accepting that 25% is a valid number for pass-by.

2952
05:14:20,580 --> 05:14:27,165
[SPEAKER_26]: Typically I use 10 to 20% for a generic station, not even for wholesale flow.

2953
05:14:28,806 --> 05:14:44,157
[SPEAKER_26]: And the other part is they modified the default values for acceptable gaps from an under-signalized driveway, their driveway to Millsex Avenue, and they reduced this significantly by two to three seconds.

2954
05:14:44,858 --> 05:14:48,000
[SPEAKER_26]: Now they stated verbally in their testimony in June

2955
05:14:48,495 --> 05:14:58,002
[SPEAKER_26]: And I read in the letter they submitted yesterday to the board that they based that on observations they made of videos of the intersection.

2956
05:14:58,723 --> 05:15:01,325
[SPEAKER_26]: However, they provided no hard data for that.

2957
05:15:01,725 --> 05:15:04,307
[SPEAKER_26]: They provided no data that I can review.

2958
05:15:04,727 --> 05:15:07,269
[SPEAKER_26]: They provided no data to you to review.

2959
05:15:09,071 --> 05:15:17,277
[SPEAKER_26]: I do know in my one study 25 years ago, I adjusted the saturation flow rate for a signalized intersection.

2960
05:15:18,319 --> 05:15:27,923
[SPEAKER_26]: I had 10 or 15 pages of calculations and data to support that in the appendix of my study for people to review.

2961
05:15:29,044 --> 05:15:37,488
[SPEAKER_26]: Van Ness provided nothing to justify their reduction of those values in their analysis.

2962
05:15:38,248 --> 05:15:47,532
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, one or more of those things may be acceptable, but everything that I've just noted, they've taken the path

2963
05:15:47,979 --> 05:15:57,781
[SPEAKER_26]: that shows operation of the roadway network and the intersections surrounding the site are better than they might be.

2964
05:15:58,602 --> 05:16:02,502
[SPEAKER_26]: Reducing the trip generation shows better operations.

2965
05:16:04,023 --> 05:16:10,004
[SPEAKER_26]: Increasing the internal capture rate, increasing the pass-by shows better operations.

2966
05:16:10,584 --> 05:16:17,266
[SPEAKER_26]: By reducing the gaps acceptable to un-signalized intersections, it looks better on paper.

2967
05:16:19,153 --> 05:16:19,834
[SPEAKER_26]: Is it correct?

2968
05:16:20,374 --> 05:16:25,218
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't have the data to really tell you if it's correct, but that's kind of the point.

2969
05:16:25,819 --> 05:16:31,023
[SPEAKER_26]: You don't have the data to decide whether or not what they're telling you is true.

2970
05:16:33,084 --> 05:16:34,185
[SPEAKER_26]: Next to the sight lines.

2971
05:16:35,787 --> 05:16:45,935
[SPEAKER_26]: They state in their report and in their letter yesterday that the sight lines available meet or exceed the distances needed for the speeds along Middlesex Avenue.

2972
05:16:46,960 --> 05:16:48,821
[SPEAKER_26]: I was out at the site last Saturday.

2973
05:16:49,381 --> 05:16:51,222
[SPEAKER_26]: I looked for the sidelines.

2974
05:16:52,062 --> 05:17:02,646
[SPEAKER_26]: By field observations, I really question that they have the necessary distance available due to obstructions in the sightline that are out there today.

2975
05:17:03,187 --> 05:17:06,948
[SPEAKER_26]: You have vegetation to the north, shrubbery, that can be clear.

2976
05:17:07,588 --> 05:17:11,990
[SPEAKER_26]: To the south, you have two utility poles that are side by side.

2977
05:17:12,430 --> 05:17:16,152
[SPEAKER_26]: You have two trees that are blocking the sightlines to the south.

2978
05:17:17,457 --> 05:17:19,858
[SPEAKER_26]: I did not go out with a wheel measurement.

2979
05:17:19,918 --> 05:17:21,278
[SPEAKER_26]: It's kind of busy out there.

2980
05:17:21,858 --> 05:17:32,281
[SPEAKER_26]: But they need to show on a plan to this board that they have the adequate sight lines coming out of the side drive for people to exit safely.

2981
05:17:33,081 --> 05:17:36,362
[SPEAKER_26]: One of the things I noted, and I don't know why it happens,

2982
05:17:37,012 --> 05:17:49,958
[SPEAKER_26]: and it may be sightline related, it may not, but people turning right out of the site, if there's no one at the stop bar, they tend to shy to the middle to the left of the lane to swing wide to go right.

2983
05:17:50,758 --> 05:17:52,018
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know why that is.

2984
05:17:52,038 --> 05:17:58,841
[SPEAKER_26]: It may be the vegetation, the hedgerow that's along the right side there, or it may be an issue with the sightlines.

2985
05:17:58,881 --> 05:18:02,283
[SPEAKER_26]: They know that it's tough to see, so they sneak out so they can see better.

2986
05:18:03,505 --> 05:18:08,467
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, you don't have the data to really make an educated or a good decision.

2987
05:18:09,767 --> 05:18:10,967
[SPEAKER_26]: Could I have control of the screen?

2988
05:18:10,987 --> 05:18:14,929
[SPEAKER_26]: I want to share my sketch with you to go over the site layout.

2989
05:18:20,750 --> 05:18:22,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Annie, will you share the screen?

2990
05:18:22,591 --> 05:18:24,511
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, Annie.

2991
05:18:31,914 --> 05:18:32,514
[SPEAKER_26]: There we go.

2992
05:18:33,922 --> 05:18:34,603
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

2993
05:18:38,486 --> 05:18:38,827
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

2994
05:18:38,867 --> 05:18:40,088
[SPEAKER_26]: Can you see my screen now?

2995
05:18:40,768 --> 05:18:41,309
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, we can.

2996
05:18:41,689 --> 05:18:43,391
[SPEAKER_26]: It shows you the sketch with the red cars?

2997
05:18:44,171 --> 05:18:44,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2998
05:18:45,372 --> 05:18:45,773
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

2999
05:18:46,353 --> 05:18:50,977
[SPEAKER_26]: This is their site in the background, their layout.

3000
05:18:51,858 --> 05:18:53,460
[SPEAKER_26]: And what I've shown here is

3001
05:18:54,313 --> 05:19:00,575
[SPEAKER_26]: tanker truck, if you can see my cursor, where it's going to be fueling and a group of passenger vehicles.

3002
05:19:01,216 --> 05:19:08,938
[SPEAKER_26]: These are just generic 19 foot long passenger vehicles, not SUVs, not pickups, just passenger vehicles.

3003
05:19:09,859 --> 05:19:21,263
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, if you notice, they're going to put the fueling tanker here and fill the fueling tanks at the ports where these arrows are.

3004
05:19:23,088 --> 05:19:45,342
[SPEAKER_26]: As cars queue to buy gas, things are going to get blocked up and potentially will block up not only being able to gain access, but have to drive over the tanks and the fueling positions to get places on the site.

3005
05:19:46,602 --> 05:19:52,186
[SPEAKER_26]: I should let you know that I am a BJ's member, that may get me in trouble with them, but

3006
05:19:53,382 --> 05:19:57,084
[SPEAKER_26]: I buy gas at BJ's three, four times a week.

3007
05:19:58,205 --> 05:20:09,332
[SPEAKER_26]: And it is a routine occasion for me to buy gas and have at least one car queued behind vehicles a lot of times too.

3008
05:20:09,412 --> 05:20:11,493
[SPEAKER_26]: This is not a unique situation.

3009
05:20:13,374 --> 05:20:17,797
[SPEAKER_26]: I experienced and I visit four BJ's for gas at a regular basis.

3010
05:20:18,917 --> 05:20:22,920
[SPEAKER_26]: And I see this with one or two cars

3011
05:20:23,865 --> 05:20:27,066
[SPEAKER_26]: waiting to get to the pumps on a routine basis.

3012
05:20:27,486 --> 05:20:43,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me, Mr. Ullman, just because of the lateness of the hour, would you be able to kind of wrap up because we may have a couple of other comments from members of the public and also there's not gonna be a vote tonight on this issue.

3013
05:20:44,812 --> 05:20:49,534
[SPEAKER_26]: As this here that I've shown here is not a unique situation in my experience.

3014
05:20:50,054 --> 05:20:52,115
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think if you go to BJ's, you'll see that.

3015
05:20:53,268 --> 05:21:01,253
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think my report, my letter states my concerns, and the conclusion of my report stands for itself.

3016
05:21:01,273 --> 05:21:04,494
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, thank you very much.

3017
05:21:07,696 --> 05:21:10,137
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other other members of the public that wish to speak?

3018
05:21:11,798 --> 05:21:14,840
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, B. Dan Fairchild, you are unmuted.

3019
05:21:15,230 --> 05:21:17,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, me Daniel Fairchild, 54 Dwyer Circle again.

3020
05:21:17,952 --> 05:21:31,601
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate the work that's been done with the pedestrian access there and the complete streets stuff on Millstack's Ave for bicycles.

3021
05:21:33,322 --> 05:21:48,796
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it would be great if all the plans for that were sent to the bicycle advisory commission, which I happen to be a member, for review, just so we can take a look at those and offer any commentary on the specific bicycle plans.

3022
05:21:49,476 --> 05:21:49,756
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

3023
05:21:49,957 --> 05:21:50,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

3024
05:21:51,898 --> 05:21:58,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, B. Dan.

3025
05:21:58,324 --> 05:21:59,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other public comments?

3026
05:22:06,154 --> 05:22:07,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Any, I'm sorry, were there any other public comments?

3027
05:22:09,235 --> 05:22:10,496
[SPEAKER_20]: No, none have come in.

3028
05:22:11,697 --> 05:22:12,017
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

3029
05:22:14,758 --> 05:22:23,082
[SPEAKER_14]: So Mr. Vaughn, my understanding is that you're not looking for a decision tonight and that this will be requesting a continuance of this matter.

3030
05:22:23,982 --> 05:22:32,586
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I think Mr. Chairman, we really wanted to gain some feedback from the board, whether we were, you know, we feel that we've,

3031
05:22:33,215 --> 05:22:41,697
[SPEAKER_24]: done a good job of addressing the comments that we have heard before about how we could make improvements out there that would benefit the public.

3032
05:22:42,057 --> 05:22:47,018
[SPEAKER_24]: I think you acknowledge that, look, Middlesex Ave does see a lot of traffic.

3033
05:22:47,238 --> 05:23:01,082
[SPEAKER_24]: We're not in a position to kind of fix Middlesex Ave and everything going on with it, but what can we do to provide some meaningful improvements out there, particularly from a pedestrian perspective, which we've really kind of focused in on.

3034
05:23:04,818 --> 05:23:13,443
[SPEAKER_24]: But before we finalize any plans with revised drainage or anything like that, we wanted to get your feedback.

3035
05:23:15,344 --> 05:23:16,204
[SPEAKER_24]: So that was it, yeah.

3036
05:23:16,905 --> 05:23:17,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, thank you.

3037
05:23:18,926 --> 05:23:23,889
[SPEAKER_14]: Members of the board, let me let you open up to comments.

3038
05:23:24,609 --> 05:23:27,431
[SPEAKER_14]: Any feedback or thoughts about what you've seen tonight?

3039
05:23:28,351 --> 05:23:30,072
[SPEAKER_14]: You can provide some guidance to the applicant.

3040
05:23:39,227 --> 05:23:42,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Deanna, you're unmuted, are you?

3041
05:23:43,550 --> 05:23:53,478
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that what we've seen in terms of the things that are being proposed address a lot of the concerns that we have.

3042
05:23:55,919 --> 05:23:58,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Traffic engineers can go back and forth.

3043
05:23:58,755 --> 05:24:05,899
[SPEAKER_08]: forever on, you know, what trip generation to use and what internals capture and, you know, pass by and all of that.

3044
05:24:05,979 --> 05:24:14,003
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm not sure that the results of the study would change what we're having them do based on what they're proposing.

3045
05:24:15,104 --> 05:24:23,169
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if more traffic in the traffic study would result in any changes on what we would like to see.

3046
05:24:23,189 --> 05:24:27,371
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they added the crosswalks, they got MassDOT involved.

3047
05:24:28,531 --> 05:24:35,036
[SPEAKER_08]: They're talking about adding bike lanes, and that's all the things that we had asked them to address.

3048
05:24:37,538 --> 05:24:38,078
[SPEAKER_17]: That's my- Deanna.

3049
05:24:41,161 --> 05:24:43,322
[SPEAKER_17]: Would any other member like to make comments?

3050
05:24:49,267 --> 05:24:57,393
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess my only comment is, I think I do agree with Deanna that they have taken some steps

3051
05:24:58,923 --> 05:25:23,781
[SPEAKER_07]: to address some of the sort of specific issues, but it does, I don't know, at the last meeting, I talked a little bit about how BJs could, you know, take this opportunity to be, to liven up their presence and sort of make an investment in Medford.

3052
05:25:23,842 --> 05:25:25,663
[SPEAKER_07]: And I gotta be honest, I'm not,

3053
05:25:26,275 --> 05:25:29,736
[SPEAKER_07]: really feeling that in the revisions.

3054
05:25:29,756 --> 05:25:44,461
[SPEAKER_07]: They feel very sort of just checking boxes rather than thinking of the project holistically and how it fits into this neighborhood.

3055
05:25:49,573 --> 05:25:55,034
[SPEAKER_14]: You have specific thoughts about what you mean by doing more?

3056
05:25:55,434 --> 05:26:05,257
[SPEAKER_07]: There was the talk about- I mean, there was definitely talk about could the entry drive be divided and create a better entry to the site.

3057
05:26:06,517 --> 05:26:17,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that they added a sidewalk, but it looks like they added a four-foot piece of concrete to the edge of the pavement rather than thinking about a nicer path.

3058
05:26:18,668 --> 05:26:22,550
[SPEAKER_07]: between the street and the front of the building, which is set really far back.

3059
05:26:25,432 --> 05:26:27,393
[SPEAKER_07]: The landscaping looks more or less the same.

3060
05:26:27,413 --> 05:26:30,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I appreciate that they've added some more landscaping around the site.

3061
05:26:35,678 --> 05:26:46,665
[SPEAKER_07]: But it all seems sort of like, I guess what I was sort of hoping for was a more holistic look at how this,

3062
05:26:51,872 --> 05:27:02,896
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's, you know, not in an industrial neighborhood, but, you know, how it fits here.

3063
05:27:11,659 --> 05:27:14,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, any other members have comments?

3064
05:27:21,370 --> 05:27:25,093
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll just, David, are you unmuting or?

3065
05:27:26,395 --> 05:27:27,395
[SPEAKER_25]: I was trying to, sure.

3066
05:27:27,696 --> 05:27:28,216
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

3067
05:27:28,516 --> 05:27:42,109
[SPEAKER_25]: More granular than Clyce's, but I was concerned during the presentation the last time and continue to be concerned about that circulation in and out of the gas pump area.

3068
05:27:43,246 --> 05:27:54,953
[SPEAKER_25]: I just think you're bringing folks into that little T and there's a lot of traffic going in multiple different directions, trying to get in and queue into line and come out of the gas operation.

3069
05:27:56,514 --> 05:28:11,824
[SPEAKER_25]: That compounded with the fact that the gas tanker is very much nearby and you've got the travel lane right there that every those in, in and out of vehicles, in and out of the gas fueling station kind of have to fight their way in and out of the travel lane.

3070
05:28:12,355 --> 05:28:13,216
[SPEAKER_25]: across the site.

3071
05:28:14,076 --> 05:28:15,777
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it could be a source of a problem.

3072
05:28:15,838 --> 05:28:19,920
[SPEAKER_25]: I wish there was a different way to queue those vehicles that felt safer to me.

3073
05:28:28,366 --> 05:28:37,573
[SPEAKER_14]: I will say I appreciate the effort to work with the city and the state on the striping and the

3074
05:28:39,305 --> 05:28:43,468
[SPEAKER_14]: making it more of a complete street than what it is today.

3075
05:28:46,651 --> 05:28:53,416
[SPEAKER_14]: Would you, I don't know if Mr. Kelly, you want to respond to anything you've heard so far or leave it there?

3076
05:28:58,200 --> 05:28:59,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think, well, we can respond.

3077
05:29:00,502 --> 05:29:01,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we just got this letter.

3078
05:29:01,503 --> 05:29:04,265
[SPEAKER_02]: We can take a look and digest and respond for the next hearing.

3079
05:29:11,476 --> 05:29:13,417
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Chairman, if I could just say something.

3080
05:29:14,097 --> 05:29:15,458
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

3081
05:29:15,778 --> 05:29:18,959
[SPEAKER_24]: So we certainly appreciate the feedback.

3082
05:29:19,019 --> 05:29:23,801
[SPEAKER_24]: I, you know, we do feel that the circulation does work, works well.

3083
05:29:23,881 --> 05:29:31,404
[SPEAKER_24]: I think this is consistent with, you know, what a lot of BJ's operations have in terms of the width of the access.

3084
05:29:31,464 --> 05:29:40,447
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know that the gentleman from the national spoke, you know, pointed out what he thought was some liabilities, but, you know, didn't point out that they were,

3085
05:29:41,027 --> 05:29:48,632
[SPEAKER_24]: you know, three other fueling stations available that really would not necessitate people having to queue where, you know, he was showing those queues.

3086
05:29:49,072 --> 05:30:02,802
[SPEAKER_24]: But, you know, we can certainly drill down a little bit further to provide the board more comfort that, you know, we're not going to be creating any type of a traffic hazard or, you know, a bad situation within the site.

3087
05:30:03,862 --> 05:30:05,904
[SPEAKER_24]: As far as the other improvements, I mean,

3088
05:30:10,335 --> 05:30:11,896
[SPEAKER_24]: maybe taking a more holistic look.

3089
05:30:11,956 --> 05:30:32,787
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, what we really tried to do was provide pedestrian enhancements along Middlesex Avenue to make that a much safer area off of our site for pedestrians, as well as providing a safe pedestrian access route for people to be able to walk to the main store itself.

3090
05:30:33,307 --> 05:30:39,170
[SPEAKER_24]: I know there was comment about people living nearby that might want to go to the store, buy a gallon of milk,

3091
05:30:40,032 --> 05:30:46,795
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, you know, probably going to be walking out there with, you know, shopping carts full of things and walking back and forth.

3092
05:30:46,895 --> 05:30:50,357
[SPEAKER_24]: But still, there could be a fair number of people that might want to walk to the store.

3093
05:30:50,397 --> 05:30:56,339
[SPEAKER_24]: So we are really trying to make a, I would say, a holistic improvement to what's out there.

3094
05:30:56,379 --> 05:30:58,500
[SPEAKER_24]: BJ's takes a lot of pride in this location.

3095
05:30:59,761 --> 05:31:03,982
[SPEAKER_24]: It's their very first BJ's in their entire portfolio, the first one built.

3096
05:31:05,223 --> 05:31:06,824
[SPEAKER_24]: They really are desirous of

3097
05:31:07,943 --> 05:31:12,426
[SPEAKER_24]: improving the appearance of it, you know, providing this as an amenity of their customer base.

3098
05:31:13,727 --> 05:31:30,219
[SPEAKER_24]: But, you know, we can certainly, you know, look at some other opportunities to, you know, make some improvements, but, you know, we try to do a good job of, you know, with the feedback that we heard to address it, but we'll continue to have a dialogue, so.

3099
05:31:30,479 --> 05:31:35,443
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I do appreciate the extra landscaping that was put in there.

3100
05:31:36,336 --> 05:31:39,458
[SPEAKER_14]: and the path, the pedestrian path to the store.

3101
05:31:39,518 --> 05:31:42,100
[SPEAKER_14]: And it makes sense where you put it, I think, in my opinion.

3102
05:31:46,644 --> 05:31:55,930
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, well, let's take a motion to continue this till August 20th.

3103
05:31:55,990 --> 05:31:56,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion on the floor?

3104
05:31:58,993 --> 05:32:01,094
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll make a motion to continue this till August 20th.

3105
05:32:01,114 --> 05:32:03,676
[SPEAKER_14]: Katie, is there a second?

3106
05:32:04,376 --> 05:32:04,697
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

3107
05:32:05,423 --> 05:32:06,043
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, David.

3108
05:32:06,824 --> 05:32:07,585
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, roll call.

3109
05:32:07,725 --> 05:32:08,445
[SPEAKER_14]: David Blumberg?

3110
05:32:09,386 --> 05:32:09,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

3111
05:32:10,467 --> 05:32:11,067
[SPEAKER_14]: Christy Dowd?

3112
05:32:12,628 --> 05:32:12,729
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

3113
05:32:13,789 --> 05:32:14,570
[SPEAKER_14]: Klaus Andresen?

3114
05:32:18,493 --> 05:32:18,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Klaus?

3115
05:32:23,317 --> 05:32:23,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

3116
05:32:23,997 --> 05:32:24,678
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, thank you.

3117
05:32:25,939 --> 05:32:26,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Jackie Furtado?

3118
05:32:27,400 --> 05:32:27,540
[SPEAKER_28]: Aye.

3119
05:32:28,460 --> 05:32:29,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Katie McHugh?

3120
05:32:29,641 --> 05:32:29,761
[SPEAKER_28]: Aye.

3121
05:32:30,422 --> 05:32:31,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Deanna Peabody?

3122
05:32:31,042 --> 05:32:31,883
[SPEAKER_28]: Aye.

3123
05:32:33,786 --> 05:32:34,807
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, thank you very much.

3124
05:32:34,887 --> 05:32:35,967
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm an aye as well.

3125
05:32:38,389 --> 05:32:39,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for staying up with us so late.

3126
05:32:40,030 --> 05:32:40,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Apologies.

3127
05:32:40,991 --> 05:32:47,615
[SPEAKER_20]: And just to confirm, Mark, you'll work with me on an extension of the timeframe, correct?

3128
05:32:48,435 --> 05:32:49,776
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, that's not a problem.

3129
05:32:49,796 --> 05:32:54,079
[SPEAKER_24]: Whatever we need to do to meet statutory deadlines is fine, yeah.

3130
05:32:54,679 --> 05:32:55,700
[SPEAKER_20]: Great, perfect, thank you.

3131
05:32:56,560 --> 05:32:58,942
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, thank you everybody from the public who spoke as well.

3132
05:32:59,142 --> 05:32:59,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate it.

3133
05:33:10,570 --> 05:33:12,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Next item on the agenda, plowing ahead.

3134
05:33:12,811 --> 05:33:18,913
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a review of bond reduction and lot release requests for winter place definitive subdivision at 25 winter place.

3135
05:33:24,636 --> 05:33:25,896
[SPEAKER_14]: Annie, do we have?

3136
05:33:28,297 --> 05:33:31,658
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I have unmuted Matt and Joe.

3137
05:33:32,239 --> 05:33:35,240
[SPEAKER_20]: And thank you guys for sticking around so late.

3138
05:33:36,763 --> 05:33:47,647
[SPEAKER_20]: If you want, I can just give sort of a brief overview of what you're asking for and the situation, and you can supplement it as you'd like, if that works.

3139
05:33:47,667 --> 05:33:47,787
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

3140
05:33:47,807 --> 05:33:53,069
[SPEAKER_16]: So the city currently holds a bond in the amount of $373,015 to ensure completion of public improvements at the site.

3141
05:34:02,320 --> 05:34:07,602
[SPEAKER_20]: And the proponent is requesting that the board reduce that bond amount.

3142
05:34:08,923 --> 05:34:11,904
[SPEAKER_20]: They requested that it be reduced down to $27,774.

3143
05:34:12,944 --> 05:34:20,548
[SPEAKER_20]: And the city engineer performed a site visit and a review of their reduction request.

3144
05:34:20,668 --> 05:34:22,408
[SPEAKER_20]: And his estimate came back at $38,126.

3145
05:34:22,808 --> 05:34:31,252
[SPEAKER_20]: So he'd like the city to hold on to a little bit more funding or bond amount than what the proponent had requested.

3146
05:34:32,782 --> 05:34:40,506
[SPEAKER_20]: He said that this estimate includes a 20% contingency, but this amount could be adjusted at the discretion of the board if you would like.

3147
05:34:41,886 --> 05:34:49,210
[SPEAKER_20]: So the board is being asked to vote whether to approve or deny this bond reduction and sort of what the amount would be.

3148
05:34:49,970 --> 05:34:52,271
[SPEAKER_20]: But the city engineer's estimate is for 38,126.

3149
05:34:52,311 --> 05:34:53,031
[SPEAKER_20]: And the second part of this is that

3150
05:34:57,501 --> 05:35:03,002
[SPEAKER_20]: The proponent had asked for the board's opinion on whether they could pursue full building permits.

3151
05:35:03,702 --> 05:35:08,283
[SPEAKER_20]: And I did get the city engineer's take on that.

3152
05:35:08,303 --> 05:35:12,284
[SPEAKER_20]: And he said, I take no exception to releasing the lots for full building permits.

3153
05:35:12,344 --> 05:35:13,444
[SPEAKER_20]: In fact, I prefer it.

3154
05:35:14,064 --> 05:35:16,804
[SPEAKER_20]: It is nice to have the houses built prior to final paving.

3155
05:35:17,404 --> 05:35:23,525
[SPEAKER_20]: It also gives the binder a time to settle in reducing things like potholes and sub-base related cracking in the finish.

3156
05:35:23,846 --> 05:35:26,366
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's just sort of an update on that.

3157
05:35:28,295 --> 05:35:37,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, well, Joe and Matt, are you willing to go along with the engineer's recommendation on the reduction of bond?

3158
05:35:39,398 --> 05:35:41,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, yep, seems reasonable, yeah.

3159
05:35:41,439 --> 05:35:45,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, thank you, it seems reasonable to me as well.

3160
05:35:46,100 --> 05:35:47,861
[SPEAKER_14]: Any board members wish to comment?

3161
05:35:51,081 --> 05:35:52,002
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing none, let's...

3162
05:35:53,735 --> 05:36:01,962
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, the issue around releasing the lots for building permits, any comments about that?

3163
05:36:02,242 --> 05:36:07,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Or is there a consensus to recommend that that move forward as well?

3164
05:36:08,247 --> 05:36:08,427
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

3165
05:36:09,248 --> 05:36:09,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, thank you.

3166
05:36:10,589 --> 05:36:19,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion to reduce the bond to 38,000 and to recommend a release of the lots to the building commissioner?

3167
05:36:24,683 --> 05:36:26,224
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm just looking for the proper name.

3168
05:36:28,644 --> 05:36:29,125
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

3169
05:36:35,247 --> 05:36:36,707
[SPEAKER_28]: What is the proper name of the proponent?

3170
05:36:39,608 --> 05:36:41,149
[SPEAKER_28]: This is the Winthrop Place.

3171
05:36:41,709 --> 05:36:42,529
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, Winthrop Place.

3172
05:36:42,589 --> 05:36:44,410
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't want to mistake it for Winthrop Estates.

3173
05:36:46,038 --> 05:36:47,579
[SPEAKER_14]: But they probably wouldn't want that.

3174
05:36:48,040 --> 05:36:49,140
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, definitely not.

3175
05:36:49,401 --> 05:36:49,801
[SPEAKER_28]: I will.

3176
05:36:50,942 --> 05:36:59,789
[SPEAKER_28]: I would like to give a motion to release the bond for Winthrop place so that they can for them to move forward.

3177
05:37:00,209 --> 05:37:04,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, well just to reduce it to 38,000 I think we'd have to put in there.

3178
05:37:06,708 --> 05:37:15,750
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, so I actually give a motion to reduce the bond to 30,000 for Winthrop Place.

3179
05:37:16,150 --> 05:37:16,550
[SPEAKER_14]: 38,000, okay.

3180
05:37:16,570 --> 05:37:18,450
[SPEAKER_28]: 38,000, sorry.

3181
05:37:18,710 --> 05:37:27,632
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we also have to say and to recommend release of the lots for building permits.

3182
05:37:29,092 --> 05:37:32,533
[SPEAKER_28]: And to recommend the release of the lots

3183
05:37:33,311 --> 05:37:34,312
[SPEAKER_28]: for building permits.

3184
05:37:34,792 --> 05:37:35,313
[SPEAKER_28]: I apologize.

3185
05:37:35,593 --> 05:37:38,916
[SPEAKER_28]: I originally just said for them to move forward, and I know that it's not that easy.

3186
05:37:40,297 --> 05:37:42,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to be specific.

3187
05:37:42,799 --> 05:37:43,060
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

3188
05:37:43,080 --> 05:37:43,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a second?

3189
05:37:44,481 --> 05:37:44,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

3190
05:37:45,382 --> 05:37:46,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, David.

3191
05:37:46,643 --> 05:37:47,623
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, roll call vote.

3192
05:37:48,084 --> 05:37:48,764
[SPEAKER_14]: David Blumberg?

3193
05:37:49,325 --> 05:37:49,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

3194
05:37:50,226 --> 05:37:50,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Klaas Andreassen?

3195
05:37:54,369 --> 05:37:54,509
Aye.

3196
05:37:55,030 --> 05:37:55,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, sorry.

3197
05:37:55,590 --> 05:37:57,432
[SPEAKER_14]: It's hard to hear you.

3198
05:37:58,033 --> 05:37:58,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Katie McHugh?

3199
05:37:59,254 --> 05:37:59,374
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

3200
05:38:00,254 --> 05:38:00,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Deanna Peabody?

3201
05:38:04,832 --> 05:38:06,973
[SPEAKER_14]: I. Jackie Furtado.

3202
05:38:07,714 --> 05:38:09,155
[SPEAKER_14]: I. Christy Dowd.

3203
05:38:09,935 --> 05:38:12,016
[SPEAKER_14]: I. And I'm an I as well.

3204
05:38:13,697 --> 05:38:14,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you guys.

3205
05:38:14,758 --> 05:38:18,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate your patience and for working with us during the course of the project.

3206
05:38:18,740 --> 05:38:22,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Glad to see it moving forward so much.

3207
05:38:24,243 --> 05:38:24,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, everyone.

3208
05:38:24,884 --> 05:38:25,344
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you all.

3209
05:38:25,544 --> 05:38:25,704
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

3210
05:38:25,904 --> 05:38:26,424
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks, everybody.

3211
05:38:26,444 --> 05:38:26,945
[SPEAKER_17]: Have a good night.

3212
05:38:27,485 --> 05:38:27,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Good night.

3213
05:38:27,865 --> 05:38:28,065
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

3214
05:38:28,085 --> 05:38:28,966
[SPEAKER_17]: You too.

3215
05:38:29,266 --> 05:38:29,326
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

3216
05:38:29,346 --> 05:38:30,047
[SPEAKER_17]: Bye-bye.

3217
05:38:33,769 --> 05:38:34,089
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

3218
05:38:37,167 --> 05:38:41,130
[SPEAKER_14]: final item on the agenda is a discussion of the RP for the comprehensive plan.

3219
05:38:41,150 --> 05:38:45,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Alicia, do you want to introduce that?

3220
05:38:47,075 --> 05:38:51,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure, so I may actually just have Annie mostly speak to it.

3221
05:38:51,818 --> 05:38:55,041
[SPEAKER_15]: We've received a few comments from members of the board.

3222
05:38:55,621 --> 05:38:57,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Annie's incorporated them and can speak to that.

3223
05:38:57,923 --> 05:39:00,164
[SPEAKER_15]: A few people reached out and said they liked it.

3224
05:39:01,445 --> 05:39:03,387
[SPEAKER_15]: We would like to discuss

3225
05:39:04,105 --> 05:39:14,392
[SPEAKER_15]: with you all, I think there's just really one question, and that is, when you do a comprehensive plan, you say, what is the term that you're looking for?

3226
05:39:14,412 --> 05:39:17,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it five, 10, 15, 20, 30 years?

3227
05:39:18,695 --> 05:39:26,080
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is the planning board, so I would look to you all for opinion and guidance on that.

3228
05:39:27,801 --> 05:39:30,082
[SPEAKER_15]: This is not the mayor's area of expertise.

3229
05:39:33,754 --> 05:39:41,796
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm new to the comprehensive plan process myself, that's why we're hiring a consultant, but we really need to say in the RFP that portion of it.

3230
05:39:43,556 --> 05:39:53,479
[SPEAKER_15]: My hope would be that we could actually put this out to bid for requests for qualifications before the Community Development Board's next meeting.

3231
05:39:55,099 --> 05:40:01,281
[SPEAKER_15]: So the other sort of piece that I would like to get out of tonight is just sort of a final like,

3232
05:40:02,485 --> 05:40:03,887
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys are good with this.

3233
05:40:04,027 --> 05:40:09,513
[SPEAKER_15]: If you would like to put in any more comments, you will send them to me or Annie.

3234
05:40:10,394 --> 05:40:14,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise, we're sort of good to go to put this out on behalf of the city.

3235
05:40:14,338 --> 05:40:21,946
[SPEAKER_15]: If there are big issues, I would really like to hear that tonight, even though it's 1140.

3236
05:40:24,882 --> 05:40:28,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, it's been the last item on the agenda the last couple nights for very long meeting.

3237
05:40:29,027 --> 05:40:33,652
[SPEAKER_14]: So what's gotten the short end of the stick on this Alicia, sorry about that.

3238
05:40:36,515 --> 05:40:40,099
[SPEAKER_14]: In terms of the term, I believe state law.

3239
05:40:42,037 --> 05:40:45,958
[SPEAKER_14]: says that communities should, as a parent, I mean, it's a requirement.

3240
05:40:46,438 --> 05:40:52,060
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just not enforced that communities update their comprehensive plans every 10 years.

3241
05:40:52,140 --> 05:40:56,341
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would suggest putting 10 years as the term in the RFP.

3242
05:40:57,681 --> 05:40:57,821
[SPEAKER_14]: And...

3243
05:41:01,363 --> 05:41:13,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we should just say if anybody has further comments or suggestions, they would send them to the community development office within a week from today.

3244
05:41:15,869 --> 05:41:17,110
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that make sense, Alicia?

3245
05:41:21,512 --> 05:41:22,212
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm good with that.

3246
05:41:22,412 --> 05:41:28,995
[SPEAKER_15]: Annie, were any of the comments substantial enough that they might be worthy of just making sure everybody else

3247
05:41:29,420 --> 05:41:35,941
[SPEAKER_15]: Part of why we had everybody send them directly to Annie is to avoid conflict of open meeting law.

3248
05:41:36,501 --> 05:41:45,043
[SPEAKER_15]: So were any of the comments changes that you received substantial enough that are worthy of mention as opposed to copy edit?

3249
05:41:45,123 --> 05:41:49,684
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to tell you that I have not actually seen the comments that went straight to Annie.

3250
05:41:51,884 --> 05:41:52,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead.

3251
05:41:52,484 --> 05:41:54,465
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry.

3252
05:41:57,721 --> 05:41:59,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there an updated version?

3253
05:42:01,823 --> 05:42:04,285
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is still the working version, right?

3254
05:42:04,325 --> 05:42:06,246
[SPEAKER_15]: We send you all a link to a Google doc.

3255
05:42:06,446 --> 05:42:07,767
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's a live version.

3256
05:42:07,787 --> 05:42:08,587
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

3257
05:42:08,707 --> 05:42:08,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

3258
05:42:09,028 --> 05:42:12,029
[SPEAKER_07]: You told me that.

3259
05:42:12,049 --> 05:42:17,653
[SPEAKER_20]: So the main comments that I incorporated, um, were around sort of language tweaks.

3260
05:42:18,073 --> 05:42:20,774
[SPEAKER_20]: And one of the things was bringing in some language about, um,

3261
05:42:22,338 --> 05:42:27,681
[SPEAKER_20]: looking at the city's project review and the permitting processes and things like that.

3262
05:42:27,761 --> 05:42:42,828
[SPEAKER_20]: So I tried to expand some of the areas to include that so that when the consultants come back, they'll know that they're looking at that as well, rather than just making a plan and looking at the zoning.

3263
05:42:42,968 --> 05:42:47,150
[SPEAKER_20]: We also want to understand the city's processes and what is included in that.

3264
05:42:48,271 --> 05:42:49,952
[SPEAKER_20]: I added some language around

3265
05:42:51,262 --> 05:43:08,853
[SPEAKER_20]: strengthening that public outreach piece and the public participation and really marketing the plan and making that a focus of how do we get responses from the community and how do we make sure all different parts of the community know that this is happening and are able to participate.

3266
05:43:10,253 --> 05:43:15,417
[SPEAKER_20]: I added some language that Christy sent about broad goals.

3267
05:43:17,070 --> 05:43:19,012
[SPEAKER_20]: And maybe I can actually just read those two.

3268
05:43:19,052 --> 05:43:35,366
[SPEAKER_20]: There are a few different areas where the RFP talks about goals and things, but this was an interesting sort of overarching goals of both the comprehensive plan and the phase two that would look at kind of the zoning and the processes.

3269
05:43:35,426 --> 05:43:39,549
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's to document a clear vision, connect a public investment in that vision.

3270
05:43:40,339 --> 05:43:48,710
[SPEAKER_20]: connect regulation to that vision, create a roadmap for thinking and acting from a comprehensive perspective and providing an excellent system for project review.

3271
05:43:49,031 --> 05:43:56,040
[SPEAKER_20]: So kind of bringing that comprehensive plan from theoretical down to like, what does this mean systems wise in the city?

3272
05:43:57,113 --> 05:44:02,918
[SPEAKER_20]: So those were sort of, and then some changes to some wording around placemaking, walkability, things like that.

3273
05:44:02,938 --> 05:44:06,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that include like shifting to an online permitting system?

3274
05:44:07,242 --> 05:44:09,544
[SPEAKER_14]: And should there be any mention of that?

3275
05:44:09,964 --> 05:44:11,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Or is that like a separate track?

3276
05:44:11,646 --> 05:44:15,209
[SPEAKER_20]: We have an online permitting system.

3277
05:44:15,389 --> 05:44:19,333
[SPEAKER_20]: The city launched it right at the start of COVID.

3278
05:44:20,634 --> 05:44:23,116
[SPEAKER_20]: Right now, it's mainly just being used for building permits.

3279
05:44:24,931 --> 05:44:32,733
[SPEAKER_20]: it will be built out at some point to encompass the rest of it, but right, that's still sort of in flux, in process.

3280
05:44:32,793 --> 05:44:42,014
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's, I could mention that specifically if you want, but there is a software that the building department has committed to and is being trained on and the other department heads are being trained on.

3281
05:44:42,115 --> 05:44:45,035
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that's sort of in progress.

3282
05:44:46,575 --> 05:44:54,177
[SPEAKER_14]: And do we specifically ask for a, have a digital, digitized zoning map?

3283
05:44:56,070 --> 05:44:57,311
[SPEAKER_20]: That is also in progress.

3284
05:44:57,431 --> 05:45:02,675
[SPEAKER_20]: The assessor's office is, there's a consulting firm making that for them.

3285
05:45:03,856 --> 05:45:04,116
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

3286
05:45:06,357 --> 05:45:06,958
[SPEAKER_21]: Do we have anything online?

3287
05:45:07,018 --> 05:45:08,859
[SPEAKER_15]: It seems to me that... Oops, sorry.

3288
05:45:10,380 --> 05:45:21,068
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just gonna say that it seems to me that in this day and age, if one produced a new zoning map, it would, by default, be digital.

3289
05:45:23,369 --> 05:45:24,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Be like a GIS map?

3290
05:45:25,234 --> 05:45:31,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I can't imagine that anybody would produce a map that was not.

3291
05:45:32,516 --> 05:45:42,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, although I'm just thinking that first part of a comprehensive plan is not the actual zoning change, but I, you know, digitizing what we have now.

3292
05:45:43,479 --> 05:45:45,039
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so that's in progress.

3293
05:45:45,079 --> 05:45:51,601
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I would assume that part of since phase one is sort of the comprehensive plan and phase two is more looking at the

3294
05:45:53,469 --> 05:45:55,671
[SPEAKER_20]: the vision and goals from the comprehensive plan.

3295
05:45:55,791 --> 05:45:58,433
[SPEAKER_20]: What do we need to change in the zoning?

3296
05:45:58,473 --> 05:46:01,155
[SPEAKER_20]: What do we need to change in our processes to get there?

3297
05:46:02,356 --> 05:46:09,002
[SPEAKER_20]: And so that I would envision would include an update to that digital zoning map to reflect any zoning changes.

3298
05:46:10,083 --> 05:46:15,607
[SPEAKER_20]: But also the engineering department will sort of take ownership of that map once it exists.

3299
05:46:15,647 --> 05:46:21,272
[SPEAKER_20]: It'll be a GIS layer that can actually be edited and changed and exists already.

3300
05:46:22,227 --> 05:46:43,335
[SPEAKER_14]: And having tonight's discussion very fresh in the mind, is there language around, because I haven't looked at this closely recently, is there language about identifying areas of the city that for walkability, commercial development, because I think

3301
05:46:44,590 --> 05:46:56,398
[SPEAKER_14]: I think really identifying really the key areas for development in the city is, you know, it's going to be a limited number of places like Medford Square, like a few other places.

3302
05:46:56,658 --> 05:47:07,645
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that should really be part of what the consultant produces so that the city understands like, here's where we're growing.

3303
05:47:14,109 --> 05:47:14,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

3304
05:47:23,287 --> 05:47:24,028
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other comments?

3305
05:47:28,713 --> 05:47:37,382
[SPEAKER_17]: So is there a motion to approve the RFP?

3306
05:47:39,925 --> 05:47:41,667
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, I have one question.

3307
05:47:42,267 --> 05:47:45,391
[SPEAKER_21]: My internet went out when you were talking about the term.

3308
05:47:46,797 --> 05:47:48,158
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay, decided.

3309
05:47:48,178 --> 05:47:57,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I was I was suggesting 10 years because state law does state that community should have every 10 years and updated master plan.

3310
05:47:57,826 --> 05:48:03,171
[SPEAKER_14]: So even though it's not enforced at all, but we should probably put have that be the term.

3311
05:48:04,011 --> 05:48:05,713
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I guess there's sort of two terms.

3312
05:48:06,674 --> 05:48:08,195
[SPEAKER_20]: In my mind, there's like the term

3313
05:48:08,708 --> 05:48:14,009
[SPEAKER_20]: of like when you do the plan, but if it should be looking farther than that, I guess.

3314
05:48:14,329 --> 05:48:17,350
[SPEAKER_20]: There was some language about 10 to 20 years.

3315
05:48:17,370 --> 05:48:31,432
[SPEAKER_20]: That's something that I think if you guys have any input on, but there might be some things that wouldn't necessarily happen in 10 years that you might wanna start initial steps for or be planning for in a comprehensive plan, maybe.

3316
05:48:31,892 --> 05:48:36,733
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I've typically seen plans for 10 years, but you could mention like,

3317
05:48:37,868 --> 05:48:49,718
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, what would be short, mid long-term goals, but overall you do the plan for 10 years and then plan to revisit it every 10 similar to what Andre was saying.

3318
05:48:50,678 --> 05:49:06,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the only question that I have about that in terms of the long-term stuff is, uh, I mean, there's, you know, climate planning, like in 50 years, what are we thinking about what's going to happen in terms of flooding and, uh, you know, how does that affect where we grow now?

3319
05:49:08,415 --> 05:49:09,055
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know.

3320
05:49:10,296 --> 05:49:12,196
[SPEAKER_15]: And so you actually want to look at that.

3321
05:49:12,396 --> 05:49:21,939
[SPEAKER_15]: And so one of the things it does say is you must look at all the plans that we currently have and that exist, and we list them out.

3322
05:49:22,079 --> 05:49:29,881
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of them is that we have a climate vulnerability assessment that looks at 2030 and 2070, the present, which was like eight years ago, and 2030 and 2070.

3323
05:49:37,313 --> 05:49:39,775
[SPEAKER_15]: but that they need to take that in account, right?

3324
05:49:39,875 --> 05:49:48,342
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you don't want to designate a huge development district in the place that you think is going to be flooded in 20 years.

3325
05:49:49,002 --> 05:50:02,192
[SPEAKER_15]: So having that in your mind, my one thought on one of thinking about longer term is the fact that there is no existing long-term plan.

3326
05:50:02,332 --> 05:50:05,475
[SPEAKER_15]: Like this isn't like the 10 year update of our 50 year plan.

3327
05:50:07,215 --> 05:50:08,696
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no 50 year plan.

3328
05:50:08,996 --> 05:50:10,417
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no 30 year plan.

3329
05:50:11,358 --> 05:50:14,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, but we need action.

3330
05:50:14,941 --> 05:50:19,905
[SPEAKER_15]: We need short term stuff, but nobody's done that longterm visioning.

3331
05:50:20,365 --> 05:50:22,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what do you, and what's the term that you prefer Alicia?

3332
05:50:23,347 --> 05:50:26,390
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, and how would that affect the scope and cost?

3333
05:50:30,252 --> 05:50:36,037
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there's a certain amount of that I think is embedded in it that they would

3334
05:50:36,972 --> 05:50:43,273
[SPEAKER_15]: take into account things that are longer term that we know about, like the climate things that you mentioned.

3335
05:50:43,833 --> 05:50:50,094
[SPEAKER_15]: That, I think, would just be a normal piece of a modern comprehensive plan.

3336
05:50:51,875 --> 05:51:04,017
[SPEAKER_15]: But whether we want to ask them to specifically do long-range visioning as well as immediate changes, it's harder to do long-range visioning with the community.

3337
05:51:08,556 --> 05:51:18,742
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's part of why I kind of wanted to raise it with this group is like, do we just say we want to look at the next 10 years and that's it?

3338
05:51:19,523 --> 05:51:26,287
[SPEAKER_15]: Or do we put in some language around long-term vision with actions for the next 10 years?

3339
05:51:30,970 --> 05:51:32,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Any members have thoughts?

3340
05:51:39,005 --> 05:51:45,171
[SPEAKER_18]: I kind of like the latter, that there's a really long-term vision, but there's like a 10-year action plan.

3341
05:51:45,191 --> 05:51:48,774
[SPEAKER_18]: It kind of encompasses the best of both worlds.

3342
05:51:52,157 --> 05:52:02,166
[SPEAKER_21]: And then with the 10-year action plan, is the consultant going to advise on how to measure, like,

3343
05:52:02,647 --> 05:52:13,033
[SPEAKER_21]: key performance indicators and like how the city is like actually achieving those 10 year objectives.

3344
05:52:13,593 --> 05:52:15,454
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, cause then how do you measure yourself?

3345
05:52:15,474 --> 05:52:21,958
[SPEAKER_21]: Cause you know, everybody says like, oh yeah, city always does plans, but then nothing ever happens.

3346
05:52:22,038 --> 05:52:22,238
[SPEAKER_21]: So.

3347
05:52:22,258 --> 05:52:28,061
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's why you need like different range.

3348
05:52:28,920 --> 05:52:34,364
[SPEAKER_15]: actions, you need stuff that you can do in the short term, because the city does stuff.

3349
05:52:34,764 --> 05:52:42,589
[SPEAKER_15]: It just takes so blasted long sometimes that to the general public, it looks like we never do anything.

3350
05:52:44,131 --> 05:52:44,431
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

3351
05:52:44,451 --> 05:52:57,820
[SPEAKER_21]: So to that point, it's like maybe the consultant can advise on how the actions that the city is taking are being measured and reported out for progress.

3352
05:52:59,951 --> 05:53:00,651
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be good.

3353
05:53:00,671 --> 05:53:07,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, like performance measures and that are evaluated like every year, every two years.

3354
05:53:13,175 --> 05:53:13,675
[SPEAKER_15]: To track.

3355
05:53:14,795 --> 05:53:22,597
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the things that I've seen is that a community creates a comprehensive plan.

3356
05:53:23,398 --> 05:53:27,719
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the committee that works on that continues to meet

3357
05:53:28,690 --> 05:53:36,351
[SPEAKER_15]: once or twice a year after that as to make sure that actions are moving forward and things continue to happen.

3358
05:53:37,332 --> 05:53:54,895
[SPEAKER_15]: That it sort of evolves into, it doesn't just go away when the plan is written, but they come back every six months and review the actions and how it's going.

3359
05:53:54,915 --> 05:53:57,395
[SPEAKER_15]: That feels like something less that needs to be in the

3360
05:53:57,765 --> 05:54:08,432
[SPEAKER_15]: the plan in the RFP and more a decision by this group of people that, yes, we want to make sure that happens.

3361
05:54:09,493 --> 05:54:26,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, since it seems like there is some interest from you, Alicia, and some members of the board about the long-term piece, I think 30 years, I think maybe a 30-year vision with goals and identifying the

3362
05:54:27,529 --> 05:54:37,619
[SPEAKER_14]: kind of the growth hubs and corridors in the city is important, but then really focusing on what we're going to do in the next 10 years.

3363
05:54:37,639 --> 05:54:45,026
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, that seems to make sense to me.

3364
05:54:45,427 --> 05:54:47,028
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it makes sense to me.

3365
05:54:47,168 --> 05:54:50,812
[SPEAKER_15]: It feels like a lot to do off, but.

3366
05:54:52,322 --> 05:54:59,544
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd rather think big and just try to do it right to begin with, than try to say, ooh, that's too much.

3367
05:55:00,165 --> 05:55:01,865
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm afraid it's too much work.

3368
05:55:02,405 --> 05:55:05,886
[SPEAKER_15]: We've identified funding from the Community Development Block Grant.

3369
05:55:06,587 --> 05:55:13,089
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think the worst thing that's gonna happen is it's gonna take a little longer and it's gonna cost a little bit more.

3370
05:55:13,109 --> 05:55:14,249
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd rather,

3371
05:55:18,622 --> 05:55:23,603
[SPEAKER_15]: have it take a little longer in the end and cost a little more, then not be useful.

3372
05:55:24,664 --> 05:55:27,504
[SPEAKER_15]: And not be something that's gonna help.

3373
05:55:28,825 --> 05:55:29,265
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.

3374
05:55:29,285 --> 05:55:35,266
[SPEAKER_14]: I just also know that there's a lot of plans that sit on the shelf and it's hard for us to know.

3375
05:55:35,286 --> 05:55:40,527
[SPEAKER_14]: We couldn't have envisioned, I don't think we can envision what the world's going to be like in 20 or 30 years.

3376
05:55:41,028 --> 05:55:45,729
[SPEAKER_14]: So I feel like the scope around the long-term stuff should be really restricted.

3377
05:55:45,769 --> 05:55:46,369
[SPEAKER_14]: We shouldn't try to

3378
05:55:46,949 --> 05:56:07,063
[SPEAKER_14]: predict or control what's happening, we should really try to have sort of a vision that encapsulates some shared goals and principles, identify what some of those long-term goals are, like it could be, and then identify some of the areas where we think are the kind of transformative places where we might expect growth or development to happen.

3379
05:56:07,143 --> 05:56:13,207
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we should specifically reference the climate vulnerability plan as part of that work.

3380
05:56:14,736 --> 05:56:23,341
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, like, you know, having that be bounded of the 30 year stuff be bounded and really focus on what we're doing now and in the next 10 years.

3381
05:56:23,361 --> 05:56:25,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that makes sense.

3382
05:56:27,703 --> 05:56:37,468
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, I just had to laugh because as you are probably aware, I've been working on moving offices from downstairs to, to the community development office.

3383
05:56:37,928 --> 05:56:44,372
[SPEAKER_15]: And today my daughter was filling plans onto the bookcase in the office.

3384
05:56:45,752 --> 05:56:47,935
[SPEAKER_15]: There's just, she's like, wow, there are a lot of plans.

3385
05:56:47,975 --> 05:56:49,397
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm like, yeah, there are a lot of plans.

3386
05:56:50,218 --> 05:56:50,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

3387
05:56:53,542 --> 05:56:57,747
[SPEAKER_15]: But there are a lot of... So maybe if I can take... Go.

3388
05:56:57,887 --> 05:57:02,072
[SPEAKER_20]: I can take a stab at adding some language about what I'm hearing is...

3389
05:57:04,196 --> 05:57:19,871
[SPEAKER_20]: It'd be kind of a 10-year plan, but with a piece that is looking long-term, a long-term visioning piece that really focuses on where do we want to be in 30 years or so, and takes into account climate and key development areas and all of that.

3390
05:57:20,211 --> 05:57:23,975
[SPEAKER_20]: But the plan itself and the action items would be focused on that 10-year timeframe.

3391
05:57:25,435 --> 05:57:35,764
[SPEAKER_20]: Other things to emphasize will be making sure the plan has key performance indicators or some way to measure the success of implementation over time.

3392
05:57:37,285 --> 05:57:43,250
[SPEAKER_17]: And yes, that's what I have so far.

3393
05:57:44,691 --> 05:57:45,452
[SPEAKER_20]: Am I missing anything?

3394
05:57:45,472 --> 05:57:49,515
[SPEAKER_17]: Sounds good.

3395
05:57:51,405 --> 05:58:06,555
[SPEAKER_20]: So I could try to add some of that language in, send out the link again when that's been done and maybe give you guys a week or so to review it and send me any final comments.

3396
05:58:07,416 --> 05:58:13,260
[SPEAKER_20]: And with the expectation that we would put this out prior to the next meeting, so we wouldn't have another group conversation about it.

3397
05:58:13,857 --> 05:58:26,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, so should we aim for, just authorize you to incorporate any edits by a certain date so you can issue the RFP by the end of July, say?

3398
05:58:26,723 --> 05:58:39,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, and I would just ask that members of this board think about who from the board would like to be on the steering committee for it, and

3399
05:58:41,987 --> 05:58:59,733
[SPEAKER_15]: that at your next meeting, August 20th, we won't be, that would be, I have to do the math, but we won't be ready to, like, that would be the earliest possible that we could be reviewing responses to it.

3400
05:58:59,773 --> 05:59:02,494
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it needs to be out there for three or four weeks.

3401
05:59:04,495 --> 05:59:10,397
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll be putting together a committee to review responses and then actually,

3402
05:59:11,035 --> 05:59:29,846
[SPEAKER_15]: to be the, like, I think we're thinking like a 20-person steering committee in the big picture, but we probably want a couple people from this board, along with myself and the chief of staff and Annie, to actually go through the consultant selection process.

3403
05:59:31,026 --> 05:59:33,788
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll see about asking for a city councilor or two.

3404
05:59:33,868 --> 05:59:37,310
[SPEAKER_14]: And Alicia, what's the role of this board you see through the process?

3405
05:59:39,729 --> 05:59:48,657
[SPEAKER_15]: In the end, this board should be endorsing the plan, should be the sort of committee behind it.

3406
05:59:48,877 --> 05:59:56,363
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the giving a final blessing, but there should be a steering committee that's the meeting regularly about it, right?

3407
05:59:56,783 --> 06:00:04,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Because people need to be reading with this consultant twice a month to keep things moving forward and on an email list.

3408
06:00:05,157 --> 06:00:24,671
[SPEAKER_15]: So you don't wanna take over community development boards, but we do want a few people to be part of a different group that's a diverse group that represents different angles and perspectives of the city to be the group that's managing it going forward.

3409
06:00:25,251 --> 06:00:28,393
[SPEAKER_15]: And then this board is gonna bless it in the end.

3410
06:00:29,014 --> 06:00:33,877
[SPEAKER_15]: So they should be getting a report back from the members who are on that committee.

3411
06:00:34,961 --> 06:00:36,542
[SPEAKER_15]: at every community development board meeting.

3412
06:00:36,602 --> 06:00:37,302
[SPEAKER_15]: How's it going?

3413
06:00:37,382 --> 06:00:37,882
[SPEAKER_15]: What's new?

3414
06:00:38,202 --> 06:00:39,263
[SPEAKER_15]: Where does this stand?

3415
06:00:40,563 --> 06:00:42,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Report back regularly.

3416
06:00:42,164 --> 06:00:43,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds good.

3417
06:00:44,685 --> 06:00:45,005
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

3418
06:00:45,065 --> 06:00:50,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we've now moved into this July 17th.

3419
06:00:55,029 --> 06:00:59,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we need a motion on this, Alicia, or is the feedback enough?

3420
06:01:01,092 --> 06:01:03,273
[SPEAKER_15]: As long as I'm not hearing any objections,

3421
06:01:05,026 --> 06:01:06,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody's good with it.

3422
06:01:07,587 --> 06:01:11,909
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the will of the board, sort of their consensus to move it forward.

3423
06:01:12,189 --> 06:01:22,274
[SPEAKER_14]: And before recruiting people for that steering committee group, you might want to, let's have, let them recover from the five and six hour meetings we've been having.

3424
06:01:22,414 --> 06:01:26,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully that's going to, we won't do this anymore in the near future.

3425
06:01:26,276 --> 06:01:28,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

3426
06:01:28,137 --> 06:01:33,500
[SPEAKER_21]: Nevermind, you know, starting work at, you know, 7am.

3427
06:01:33,520 --> 06:01:34,380
[SPEAKER_21]: We should try that.

3428
06:01:34,919 --> 06:01:36,500
[SPEAKER_21]: split up the agenda a little more.

3429
06:01:37,781 --> 06:01:40,763
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, yeah, it's been a lot these last couple of meetings.

3430
06:01:40,783 --> 06:01:44,165
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you everybody for hanging in, I really appreciate it.

3431
06:01:44,446 --> 06:01:50,310
[SPEAKER_14]: And hopefully, again, I don't think the pipeline going forward will be quite as heavy as this.

3432
06:01:53,592 --> 06:01:54,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Wishful thinking, maybe?

3433
06:01:54,873 --> 06:01:56,134
Yeah.

3434
06:01:56,674 --> 06:01:58,616
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, is there a motion on the... I'm jinxed, that's Andre.

3435
06:01:59,016 --> 06:02:00,117
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

3436
06:02:00,697 --> 06:02:01,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion on the floor?

3437
06:02:03,552 --> 06:02:04,412
[SPEAKER_18]: motion to adjourn.

3438
06:02:05,913 --> 06:02:06,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

3439
06:02:07,133 --> 06:02:09,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call, David Blumberg?

3440
06:02:09,934 --> 06:02:10,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

3441
06:02:10,114 --> 06:02:10,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Katie McHugh?

3442
06:02:11,254 --> 06:02:11,334
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

3443
06:02:11,394 --> 06:02:12,034
[SPEAKER_21]: Deanna Peabody?

3444
06:02:12,755 --> 06:02:12,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

3445
06:02:32,813 --> 06:02:33,616
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a good weekend.

3446
06:02:34,398 --> 06:02:34,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, everyone.

3447
06:02:34,900 --> 06:02:35,281
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

3448
06:02:35,321 --> 06:02:35,903
[SPEAKER_21]: Take care.

3449
06:02:35,983 --> 06:02:36,104
[SPEAKER_20]: Bye.

3450
06:02:36,164 --> 06:02:36,686
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.
