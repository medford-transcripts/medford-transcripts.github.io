00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:44,343
That's very, it's a limited, it's a limited agenda. So we have time to talk. It is an emergency. Motions, orders. They're offered by Councilor Knight. Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Jerry DeCristofaro on his recent passing, Councilor Knight.

3
00:00:44,667 --> 00:01:14,104
Madam President, thank you very much. Jerry DeCristofaro, who passed away February 26th, he was a lifelong resident, lived in Summit Road, the father of Barbara DeCristofaro from Metro Police Department and Dr. DeCristofaro Registrar. Jerry spent 45 years in public service for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He served as Chief Investigator for the Licensing Board. He was responsible for establishing the rules and regulations there and enforcing standards for our licensees in the Commonwealth.

4
00:01:14,104 --> 00:01:36,237
known for his classic resemblance to Luciano Pavarotti. Mr. De Cristofaro was someone that was loved by many. He had failing health in his later years, but I remember him fondly growing up in metropolitics as someone who's always been there to lend an ear and lend wisdom and lend advice. He's certainly someone that did a great deal for this community. He raised two wonderful children who

5
00:01:36,510 --> 00:02:02,500
believe in service, as evidenced by their work, and he will be sadly missed Madam President. So, Jerry to Christopher our dear friend who served this community in this Commonwealth of Massachusetts for the better part of 50 years, I'd ask that this council joins me in extending condolences to his family on their recent loss. Thank you. Any further discussion on the motion of counselor night seconded by Councilor carb yellow, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

petitions, presentations, and similar papers. 22-281, petition for common victorial license by Starbucks Corporation, doing business as Starbucks Coffee at 177 College Avenue, Metro Massachusetts, 02155. Do we have a petitioner on the line for this? Yes, thank you very much. My name's Dan Brennan. I handle permits and licenses for Starbucks. Great, can we just get your address for the record as well? Sure, 50 Holt Road, Andover, Massachusetts.

8
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:33,063
Thank you, Mr. Brennan. I turned over to Councilor Scarpelli, Chair of the Licensing Subcommittee. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Mr. Brennan, for being here. I do see your paperwork is all in order and it's acceptable in my eyes. I know we have a few questions. The location being one, I know there's some confusion. It says 177 College Ave, Mr. Brennan. Is that located inside?

9
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:56,323
facility. And we do have an exterior storefront. So it's on the first floor level one level. Okay, and it obviously will be open for the public. Yes, sir. And not students that was a question. What are the what are the hours of operations you're planning on having.

10
00:03:56,578 --> 00:04:12,978
So right now we're going to go with 7am to 11pm, probably end up closing earlier than 11pm. We may in the future file for a special permit to open up a bit earlier, but for now we're going to stick with the 7am open to 11pm.

11
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:34,735
Okay, and there's, I see everything's in order. I know that one of the biggest issues in that area is traffic and that has been approved with no hindrances. So I move approval. I open the floor to my colleagues. Thank you. Any further discussion? Councilor Knight?

12
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:57,688
Mr. Brennan, I wish you the best of luck. I certainly have no problem with this application that's before us this evening. I'm looking forward to seeing the Cummings Center come to completion. I think this will be a nice, what they call, anchor store to bring some foot traffic through the neighborhood. There's a couple with the opening of the Green Line Extension. Hopefully in a few short months, we'll transform that neighborhood to make it a little bit more vibrant and

13
00:04:57,688 --> 00:05:24,531
We all know if there's a Starbucks, people go there. So it'd be nice to see us put traffic down there and another opportunity and an option for an amenity for some of the college students and neighborhood residents. So thank you for your application, sir. Thank you, councilor. Councilor Seng. I just wanted to know to someone in the area, I'm excited to have this option open to me. I'm excited to see my own neighborhood get more vibrant. Thank you, councilor Seng. Any further discussion?
