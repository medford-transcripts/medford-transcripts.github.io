    <p>[Jessica Healey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=0.251s">No,</a>  that's a school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2.392s">So</a>  if you're not listening to this, um, so I just, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=9.256s">Um,</a>  so I would like to know what's going to happen with my big thing is animal waste. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=16.059s">I</a>  already have holes in my barrel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=17.76s">The</a>  rats have already chewed through. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=19.581s">And</a>  so what do we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=22.703s">Like</a>  cat waste, dog waste, baby diapers, because <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=27.523s">When</a>  we had people come around here to handle the rats, they said the big thing is like dog waste. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=33.507s">Make</a>  sure you pick up your dog waste, you throw it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=36.449s">Well,</a>  we do that, but now in the rats, it's just gonna attract them more to the barrels that they chew through. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=45.795s">I</a>  can't put, use a disposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=47.756s">We</a>  don't throw food outside, but we have a bigger family and we're always full at the end of the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=56.392s">So</a>  i'm not sure How this is going to work And for these questions, are you going to like put them online to kind of eat what we're asking?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=68.218s">Yes,</a>  we're going to be updating the frequently asked questions section that's on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=73.102s">And</a>  the website is on that slide there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=75.383s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=75.764s">So</a>  there's a lot of feedback, just so everybody realizes it's worth repeating. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=78.286s">There's</a>  a lot of feedback, a lot of people want to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=80.767s">So</a>  we're trying to, you know, take the most common frequent question answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=87.172s">And</a>  if we don't have answers, as was mentioned before, or if there's a gap somewhere, then we're going to try to <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=93.497s">fill</a>  that and make updates as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=97.262s">So</a>  that's really what the goal is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=99.544s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=100.325s">So</a>  thank you, Jessica. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=103.269s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=104.07s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=104.47s">I'm</a>  going to mute you and lower your hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=107.113s">And</a>  then we're going to move to Daniel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=111.198s">I</a>  can't see the whole name, actually, unless I go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=122.323s">One</a>  second, Daniel Rosenwig.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=124.104s">Hi,</a>  I'm Daniel Rosenswig. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=132.29s">I</a>  live on Wilson Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=134.151s">I'm</a>  native to the greater Boston area, but pretty new to Medford specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=139.815s">I'm</a>  already composting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=141.156s">That's</a>  a great program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=142.317s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=144.559s">Trash</a>  cost is for collection versus how much for disposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=149.687s">Along</a>  the same lines of Robert, who spoke recently, I'm not concerned about paying for a bit of extra volume, but I am concerned about having it sit there for two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=161.436s">And</a>  I'm particularly concerned that excess might sit outside proper containers, and therefore more exposed to animals. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=168.581s">You</a>  have said that extra containers are available, but they only make sense if you'll overfill every week, and not if you overfill on an erratic basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=178.24s">I</a>  do think that composting will help to reduce the volume, but I'm concerned it won't reduce it enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=185.402s">Another</a>  speaker mentioned that pay as you throw has reduced waste by 32% elsewhere, but in order to make things work based on our existing consumption, it would have to be reduced by 50%. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=200.086s">And</a>  that's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=201.947s">I</a>  also think that our waste limits should be dependent on the number of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=210.097s">for</a>  a two-person household might not make sense for a six-person family. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=214.458s">And</a>  if we could have different limits, depending on your household size, that's a big difference for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=221.361s">And</a>  the tighter our limits are, the more that becomes an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=225.002s">You</a>  know, right now, if we have some spare room, maybe it's not such a big deal, the same limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=229.804s">But</a>  when it becomes really tight, I think that'll matter a lot more.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=233.245s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=236.227s">Thank</a>  you very much, Daniel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=241.068s">T</a>  Silvestro is next. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=243.949s">T</a>  Silvestro, I'll ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=245.89s">Please,</a>  your name and address. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=246.91s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=251.552s">Hello?</a> </p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=253.013s">Hello,</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=254.0s">Hi,</a>  my name is Tony Silvestro. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=255.861s">I</a>  live at 5 Royal Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=258.582s">My</a>  biggest concern is I live in South Medford and the rat population. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=263.823s">I've</a>  already lost one dog to leptoporosis in 2021, the pandemic with all the rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=271.186s">But</a>  I also have two dogs and I have a lot of waste. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=273.827s">And</a>  I am also a senior citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=276.207s">So</a>  my biggest concern is the senior citizens are going to be able to reel that cart out every other week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=284.611s">It's</a>  going to be heavy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=285.431s">It's</a>  all kinds of crap. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=288.233s">Pardon</a>  my language, but I just, I don't understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=292.515s">And</a>  if you're going to save money, are you going to give it back to us in our tax bill and lower our taxes? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=298.897s">Um,</a>  those are my big concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=300.778s">And,</a>  but the biggest one is the rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=303.499s">And</a>  I have had to hire an exterminator. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=306.201s">I</a>  have rat boxes all around my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=309.422s">The</a>  house across the street from me is an apartment building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=312.564s">They</a>  have their barrels are so overfilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=314.805s">It's</a>  not funny and half of it when it blows flows down my driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=318.867s">So</a>  that those are my big concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=321.268s">And</a>  that's about all I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=323.429s">And</a>  I'm going to tell everybody please make sure your dogs process because it's not a fun thing to see your dog die from. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=330.012s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=332.053s">Thank</a>  you, Tony. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=336.976s">Next</a>  up is TK. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=339.295s">TK,</a>  when I unmute you, please, your name and address, and you'll have two minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=348.218s">Good</a>  evening, Tom Kubelos at Toro Avenue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=350.619s">Toro</a>  Avenue in Medford, how are you all? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=353.3s">My</a>  comment is essentially around the pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=356.541s">In</a>  other Massachusetts communities, residents have the option to choose to holler. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=367.513s">That</a>  would mean multiple haulers could be down your street on a given day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=371.675s">All</a>  it takes is one home to request a haul. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=377.397s">And</a>  now we have two trash trucks going down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=381.098s">Has</a>  that been thought about? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=382.959s">And</a>  also, is that built into the metrics regarding the use of trucks on roads and the damage to its targets? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=390.322s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=392.623s">Thank</a>  you, TK. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=395.125s">All</a>  right, next up is Erin Dalbeck. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=398.747s">I'm</a>  going to ask you to unmute, name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=401.149s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=405.231s">Hi</a>  there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=405.692s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=406.232s">I</a>  can, Erin. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=407.593s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=408.113s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=409.454s">I</a>  don't have a lot to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=410.915s">I</a>  just wanted to say I'm in favor of this new trash program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=414.537s">I've</a>  seen, personally, composting has decreased my family's need for weekly trash pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=423.382s">I</a>  have a dog and we have a container that does lock and it stays outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=431.371s">And</a>  I've never seen any rats around my compost or in my trash area or in my dog's poop bag area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=444.163s">Um,</a>  I just really love the idea of how this is the mission behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=447.927s">I</a>  like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=448.367s">It's</a>  going to save our city money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=450.929s">Um,</a>  and, um, I feel like it's just the future of our country, what we should all be doing, um, to adapt. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=459.136s">Um,</a>  and I think that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=461.178s">So</a>  thank you for all your work.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=463.5s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=463.86s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=464.981s">Next</a>  is Stephanie Bima, Serez. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=473.84s">When</a>  I unmute you, please your name and address for the record, and you'll have two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=477.843s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=481.004s">Hi,</a>  Stephanie. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=482.966s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=483.026s">I'm</a>  Stephanie Behme. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=484.046s">I</a>  live on Broadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=485.767s">So</a>  Broadway is owned by Medford, but I'm actually not sure how much of this applies to my service because the road is owned by Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=495.093s">But</a>  anyway, I think it's a great presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=497.895s">I</a>  understand it's been long in the works. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=501.637s">I'm</a>  not an expert in this area, but of sustainability information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=505.998s">And</a>  from what I understand, pay as you go and the composting availability and everything, this is directionally, as maybe was also reflected by the awards and the rankings, this is directionally where things are going. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=521.702s">Also</a>  based on my travels in other countries, the places where their waste management is like you experience it the best, they have pay as you go systems, like Japan, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=531.853s">So</a>  anyway, I think it's great and I want to support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=535.454s">And</a>  my suggestion is that perhaps you could in the future touch more on the plans that the city with the rollout. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=544.358s">Could</a>  any part of it be progressive or gradual? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=547.98s">And</a>  as it rolls out and people adjust to it, what are the end points of feedback and possibilities for adjustment? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=555.723s">For</a>  example, if people need loaner bins or, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=558.974s">increases</a>  in their volumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=560.335s">So</a>  perhaps addressing some of those concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=563.578s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=564.618s">Thank</a>  you, Stephanie. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=565.379s">Good</a>  suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=566.019s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=567.801s">We're</a>  going to move on to Patty Kaya. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=570.143s">Patty</a>  Kaya, when I unmute you, could you please list your name and address? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=574.186s">And</a>  you'll have two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=575.367s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=579.15s">Welcome,</a>  Patty.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=580.217s">by</a>  patty k a monument street and i only have one question though i do have a couple of comments the question is how do we stop this how do we stop this train before it leaves the station um i disagree with the reducing the cadence of garbage pickup for all the same reasons that many people have have said on this call social media have said on the fourteen hundred <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=603.331s">signatory</a>  petition against this reduction in such an essential public service for all environmental concerns that we're trying to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=612.138s">My</a>  problem is that this should be the absolute last resort. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=617.202s">Taking</a>  away weekly trash pickup should be the last thing you do, not the first thing you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=623.848s">And</a>  there are people on this call that have come up with solutions that would reduce the waste product that we're talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=633.558s">before</a>  we would cut people's essential service for all of the health and safety concerns out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=639.404s">So</a>  we didn't vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=641.247s">We</a>  didn't have any input. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=642.928s">And</a>  my last comment is about the way that outreach has been handled by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=648.378s">It's</a>  almost like you think you can educate us into submission, as if we're all too ignorant to understand the environmental context of the problem, the greater problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=659.747s">We</a>  think it's the wrong solution to the problem, so you can keep trying to educate us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=666.051s">We're</a>  not too dumb to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=668.773s">We</a>  think it's the wrong solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=670.895s">We</a>  don't ignore the fact that there's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=674.632s">And</a>  we're asking you to rise above and try something else first. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=678.894s">Try</a>  other things first. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=681.096s">That's</a>  the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=682.616s">The</a>  survey was incredibly leading questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=686.419s">This</a>  educational event tonight isn't about listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=690.681s">It's</a>  about telling us that we're too dumb to understand why you're doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=694.923s">I</a>  would like some more respect from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=696.904s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=701.255s">Thank</a>  you, Patty. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=702.136s">I</a>  know I respect every single one of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=704.699s">So</a>  there's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=706.701s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=707.101s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=707.401s">We're</a>  going to move on to Jen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=709.423s">Jen,</a>  I'm going to ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=711.005s">And</a>  of course, as a reminder to everybody, I'm trying to do this out of the utmost respect for all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=718.192s">So</a>  Jen, if you could list your name and address, and you'll have two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=722.036s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=726.438s">Hi,</a>  Jen Segotsky, Placedead Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=728.659s">I'm</a>  just going to piggyback on what Patty was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=730.901s">I</a>  feel like the city has been pushing toward having a half of the pickup that we have right now, but they're not addressing the fact that there are not currently that many options for reducing the amount of trash that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=745.388s">There</a>  are certain things like soft plastics and Styrofoam in particular that are very hard to recycle or get rid of other than in the trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=754.633s">I</a>  think before we implement something like this, the city needs to have a harder push toward finding ways to recycle soft plastics, to recycling styrofoam, so that we can have the room in our bins, that it could be a lesser pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=766.678s">But</a>  right now, we live in a society where there's a lot of soft packaging, there's a lot of styrofoam. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=773.021s">You</a>  know, if I get a piece of furniture delivered, it fills up my entire bin for the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=776.903s">There's</a>  nothing I can do about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=778.483s">There's</a>  no place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=780.985s">My</a>  other concern is how do we avoid illegal dumping? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=785.249s">As</a>  we saw with the mattresses, when the city started implementing having to pay to have mattresses picked up, I've had to call the city more than once for mattresses that have been dumped in random places, like my kids' school, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=798.463s">How</a>  is that not going to happen with trash going forward when people don't have room in their bins? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=804.588s">And</a>  the third thing is, I'm not sure why the city is not pushing for other solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=809.171s">Like,</a>  for example, we have this great online community called Everything is Free Medford, where people can post things and have other people pick them up, which keeps thousands and thousands of pounds of things out of the trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=821.939s">Why</a>  the city is not pushing that more as an option for posting things to keep things out of the waste stream is just beyond me.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=827.763s">Thank</a>  you, Jen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=830.164s">That</a>  was good feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=832.147s">We're</a>  going to move on to Charlotte Cahill. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=836.451s">Charlotte</a>  Cahill, I'll ask you to please report your name and address, and you'll have two minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=844.594s">Great,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=846.516s">Hi,</a>  Charlotte Cahill. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=847.777s">I</a>  appreciate you creating this forum tonight and giving us an opportunity to provide some feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=855.703s">I</a>  want to start by just sort of echoing some of the public health and sanitation concerns that other people have shared. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=865.531s">regarding</a>  the shift to weekly or bi-weekly pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=869.532s">I'm</a>  not going to repeat everything that others have said on this, but would just add that I think one thing that's getting lodging around this is that the city's goal for composting is to have 19,000 households composting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=887.356s">If</a>  that goal is achieved, that's three quarters of households in the city, meaning that one in four households will still have food waste, <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=895.658s">their</a>  trash and federal guidelines recommend weekly pickup of all food waste precisely for the kinds of public health reasons that folks here have been raising. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=909.942s">So</a>  just want to really kind of like emphasize that point and I think the other thing that folks haven't, some people have talked some about like <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=919.005s">cuts</a>  to an essential service. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=921.146s">And</a>  what I want to call out really directly is that this is like creating an equity issue when you're cutting an essential public service. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=928.949s">What</a>  this cut is doing is reframing a public health and sanitation service that should be civil government and turning that into a conversation about the consumption choices that individual people are making. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=946.917s">That's</a>  happening without any real meaningful effort that I can see to provide alternatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=954.24s">So</a>  this isn't just about education. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=955.8s">It's</a>  not about telling us that we're going to have access to the same recycling and compost programs that we have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=962.483s">But</a>  what else can be done here?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=963.943s">Thank</a>  you, Charlotte. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=965.524s">And</a>  just to correct some information that you're putting out there, the compost service will go universal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=969.985s">So</a>  that's everybody who has eligible trash service now gets coal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=974.607s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=976.469s">All</a>  right, we're going to move to Catherine.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=978.991s">Tim,</a>  can we just make that a little bit clearer? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=980.972s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=981.992s">Because</a>  I've seen that out on the web before. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=984.134s">When</a>  we say our goal is 19,000 households composting, 19,000 households is 100% of the households on the city's waste trash system. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=994.78s">The</a>  total number of households in the city that is a higher number, those people are on commercial composting programs that are not run by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1004.006s">So</a>  our goal is composting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1006.892s">100%</a>  of the eligible households composting.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1010.034s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1010.334s">Thank</a>  you, Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1012.735s">Now</a>  we'll move to Catherine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1014.256s">Catherine,</a>  I'll ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1015.677s">If</a>  you could report your name and address, you'll have two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1018.219s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1025.003s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1025.884s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1027.084s">Hi,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1028.225s">I</a>  think I missed it the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1029.745s">Catherine</a>  Bradshaw Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1032.146s">Lived</a>  here all my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1034.547s">So</a>  the couple of people ahead of me did touch upon what was on <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1041.682s">of</a>  the list of things that I did want to mention. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1044.285s">I</a>  do want to ask though, I didn't see how we're going to, the city's going to make out with paying less money to go to the burning in Saugus versus <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1061.52s">The</a>  difference that we make in garbage to God and that was one thing I felt unless I missed it during the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1073.858s">I</a>  did want to bring up the illegal dumping, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1080.202s">So</a>  I travel down commercial to Riverside a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1084.004s">And</a>  before those apartments that are going to go up where CKS is, there's a lot of illegal dumping. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1091.488s">It's</a>  dark over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1092.789s">There's</a>  disfurniture. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1095.371s">So</a>  I think we're going to see a lot more of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1099.413s">Maybe</a>  not only there, but as other people had said, <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1103.095s">You</a>  know, the mattresses being dumped when you get furniture. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1106.64s">People</a>  leave it out on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1108.723s">I</a>  just want to mention, I have called four times from May to September. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1114.751s">People</a>  leaving furniture out, you know, you're supposed to pay for it, they don't want to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1121.573s">And</a>  then the city is saying to me, where is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1124.374s">Why</a>  is it there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1125.754s">Oh,</a>  well, if you live there, like if someone dumps in front of your house, it's your responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1130.296s">Well,</a>  I didn't put it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1131.616s">I</a>  mean, I think that may be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1133.917s">And</a>  then maybe not to mention, possibly the fistfights that will be happening when people are using other people's trash barrels. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1143.68s">I</a>  think those are things I just wanted to put out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1146.04s">And</a>  thank you very much for listening.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1147.821s">Thank</a>  you, Catherine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1149.802s">Appreciate</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1151.462s">Okay,</a>  Nicholas Girlio. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1154.523s">Nicholas,</a>  I'll ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1155.703s">If</a>  you could report your name and address, you'll have two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1158.164s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1161.425s">Real</a>  quick, may not have got you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1163.946s">Hopefully</a>  I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1164.546s">If</a>  not, I'll do it again.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1167.867s">You</a>  may have hit the one next to him.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1170.148s">Oh,</a>  yes, I hit Fred. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1171.188s">I'm</a>  going to unmute you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1172.769s">Oh,</a>  you already did it himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1174.089s">Thank</a>  you, Fred. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1174.649s">And</a>  I'm going to try Nicholas one more time.</p>

    <p>[Nick Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1180.244s">Welcome,</a>  Niklas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1202.087s">Only</a>  about 20% of people could actually commit to a yes response. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1206.891s">Now</a>  you compare this to the survey that was recently released, which doesn't ask do people want this service change, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1213.535s">And</a>  it's full of loaded questions and really, really unscientific in a lot of ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1218.279s">So</a>  my question for the city is very simply, will the city make a decision here that reflects what the majority wants? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1224.403s">Based</a>  on that poll, based on what people are saying here tonight, it seems that overwhelmingly, and based on what people have said leading to this, it seems overwhelmingly that people don't want this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1233.95s">So</a>  will the city listen? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1235.431s">Will</a>  the city propose an alternative? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1237.352s">And</a>  I fully understand and respect the financial implication, but will the city propose an alternative here that reflects what the majority wants? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1244.757s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1245.097s">Sure,</a>  Nick, you got a little bit of time left. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1247.919s">I</a>  just wanted to ask a clarifying question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1249.36s">Was</a>  there a specific element of the program that you were speaking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1255.625s">the</a>  service change obviously to bi-weekly trash collection. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1258.467s">Okay,</a>  you shouldn't say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1259.528s">I</a>  had a feeling that's what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1261.629s">I</a>  just wanted to make sure it was clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1262.97s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1265.191s">All</a>  right, we're going to move on to Fred Roach from Mute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1270.094s">If</a>  you could say your name and address, you'll have two minutes to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1273.596s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Fred Roche]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1277.599s">Yes,</a>  hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1279.68s">77</a>  Whittier Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1282.162s">I</a>  just want to go out there and say that I'm totally opposed to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1286.887s">Big</a>  surprise. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1288.389s">Second,</a>  I spoke to two landlords today at a social event. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1292.433s">They</a>  don't live in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1294.395s">Neither</a>  landlord knew anything about a trash change. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1300.441s">So</a>  I don't know what kind of notifications gone out, if any. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1305.161s">And,</a>  you know, this decision has already been made, and this has been in the residents' throats. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1310.682s">And</a>  I've lived in the city for 65 years, and in 65 years, this is going to be the worst decision I've had from the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1319.644s">And</a>  second of all, I have scrap plans to build an ADU because of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1326.686s">So</a>  I don't know if your millions of dollars in savings is going to calculate what you're going to lose. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1332.869s">But</a>  that's my thoughts on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1334.971s">I</a>  won't waste my time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1337.114s">I'll</a>  be wasting my time.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1339.677s">Thank</a>  you, Fred. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1341.018s">Just</a>  same question I had for Nicholas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1342.58s">I</a>  believe you were specifying the part of the program where it goes to every other week as opposed to like universal compost or other aspects of the program.</p>

    <p>[Fred Roche]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1350.911s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1351.832s">I</a>  just wanted to clarify.</p>

    <p>[Fred Roche]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1353.794s">I</a>  have some time remaining, so let me comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1357.478s">There's</a>  been no soliciting of the citizens with regard to how they feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1363.223s">And</a>  if whatever's been done, it's been disregarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1366.306s">And</a>  that's really a decision is going to come back and haunt the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1370.37s">It</a>  really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1372.752s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1373.833s">Have</a>  a good night. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1375.434s">Thank</a>  you, Fred.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1378.05s">I'm</a>  going to move to Sarah Berndt. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1383.196s">Sorry</a>  if I'm mispronouncing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1384.737s">Sarah</a>  Berndt. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1385.238s">I'm</a>  going to ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1386.64s">You</a>  have your name and address. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1387.48s">You'll</a>  have two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1388.562s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1394.408s">Hello?</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1395.589s">Hello.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1397.271s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1398.132s">Oh,</a>  there we go.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1399.444s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1400.625s">Sarah,</a>  nice to see you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1402.526s">Thank</a>  you all for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1403.607s">Um,</a>  I live on Sharon street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1405.469s">Um,</a>  and what others say are saying, you know, waste costs are up because plastic waste is a problem globally. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1411.173s">Now,</a>  you know, we're, I don't think we are going to only compost our way out of this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1416.558s">I</a>  think it's going to take, um, a more holistic approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1419.86s">You</a>  know, our family already composts everything that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1422.602s">We</a>  try to reduce waste as much as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1425.415s">We</a>  visit the local plastic-free refillery on Boston Ave, Trove Green Preservations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1430.136s">If</a>  you haven't heard of it, it's a great way to cut down on some of that packaging for your household goods. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1436.398s">But</a>  like others have said, I'm also worried about trash sitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1440.999s">We're</a>  pretty rat-free here in West Medford so far, knock on wood, but we really, really don't want any from Somerville over here across the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1451.142s">you</a>  know, dog waste, diapers, like people have said, the food waste, meat, all of those are going to be really, really smelly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1459.25s">I</a>  think, you know, the program in <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1462.805s">And</a>  its intent is really great, but adoption is going to happen when we make things easier for people, not harder. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1470.11s">I</a>  think we should be thinking of this more holistically, like can we increase soft plastic cycling to keep that part out of the trash? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1477.995s">Can</a>  we provide free compost bags for families to drive them towards the composting program? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1483.898s">So</a>  if we could just have options instead of feeling like we're punishing residents for having trash, <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1491.243s">Maybe</a>  we try to think about this as a explore other areas for reducing trash overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1497.347s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1498.748s">Thank</a>  you, Sarah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1500.089s">Appreciate</a>  your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1501.99s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1503.29s">Shayna,</a>  over here to get the name here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1507.993s">Shayna</a>  Simenstein, if you could please address, you'll have two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1514.918s">Welcome</a>  Shayna.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1516.394s">Hi,</a>  I am on Hume Ave in Hillside and I just wanted to thank everybody in the city for trying to address the really challenging problem of waste management because <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1533.451s">Um,</a>  the cost of waste disposal is increasing, and, like, we are running out of places to put trash, and I think this is a, and so, like, I'm in full support of trying to find creative solutions to deal with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1545.964s">Um,</a>  and, um, I guess I had just a couple of questions, I think, to reiterate a few other folks who have <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1554.572s">like</a>  are in support of this, but also have some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1559.115s">And</a>  one is, what is the city going to do about all of the residential buildings that don't qualify for this because they have more than four or six units? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1568.942s">I</a>  don't remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1570.262s">Especially</a>  when the 2030 ban on food waste takes effect from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1577.498s">And</a>  then my other question is, yeah, like, what is the city doing to kind of like holistically address this issue in addition to, like, trying to cut down on the waste stream through trash pickup, but... <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1594.397s">Like</a>  through reducing plastic at the grocery store or takeout containers etc just to like help residents achieve the goal of having like half as much trash as they currently do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1605.368s">Because</a>  I think like what I'm hearing is a lot of the concern about this is like fear of not being able to fit everything in your bin. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1612.595s">So</a>  I feel like <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1615.533s">Having</a>  the city work on tangential issues that could help reduce waste would be really helpful, especially in the next 18 month lead up to this rollout.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1624.398s">Thank</a>  you, Shana. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1627.38s">Appreciate</a>  the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1629.721s">And</a>  it looks like we have Alessandra back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1631.942s">Alessandra's</a>  iPhone is next. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1634.624s">So</a>  go ahead and unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1635.825s">If</a>  you can let us know your name and address, you'll have 2 minutes.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1656.756s">She</a>  told our troubleshooting staff that she was having trouble clicking the unmute button. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1664.601s">Alessandra,</a>  if you want to message your comment to our troubleshooting staff, get it out for you, or you could email it to waste at medford-ma.gov that you see on the screen there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1675.749s">I'm</a>  really sorry that <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1677.125s">you're</a>  having technical trouble.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1679.567s">Yeah,</a>  sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1680.328s">Let's</a>  try it one more time for good measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1685.794s">That</a>  doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1687.836s">Move</a>  to Jim Bennett. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1690.178s">So</a>  Jim Bennett, get ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1694.022s">All</a>  right, Jim Bennett, I'm going to go ahead and ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1698.426s">If</a>  you could guess, you'll have two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1699.808s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1703.22s">Oh,</a>  there we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1703.96s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1704.361s">Yeah,</a>  I have a lot of the conservative this every two week pickup, but some of my I think the intent is good about reducing trash, doing more recycling, but I find our program is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1717.087s">We</a>  do the standard recycling for the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1719.348s">I</a>  understand that, but there are a lot of the programs and styrofoam is not very recyclable, but there are places will accept it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1726.292s">Not</a>  in their curbside, but they have, um, but that fact, the recycling compost we have on there every, at least every two weeks, uh, getting rid of cardboard because yeah, you cycle bin, but try fitting everything in there with cardboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1739.474s">It</a>  doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1742.295s">And</a>  when you go to the compactor, you'll find a lot of people have stuff that shouldn't be in there, hard plastics, baskets, styrofoam. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1750.861s">And</a>  recently I saw someone say that they don't flatten their, their cardboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1756.205s">So</a>  that, that's an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1758.463s">And</a>  I think that's great that it's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1761.206s">I</a>  mean, years ago, I remember bringing bottles down and breaking them down at the city yard, probably in the 80s. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1768.192s">But</a>  what I kind of, my other question too is, in the contract, my understanding is the contract was signed two years ago, but that's not correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1777.261s">Correct</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1778.951s">And</a>  in the consideration of the contract, do we look at different vendors? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1783.074s">Do</a>  we look at dual stream? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1784.816s">I</a>  mean, right now we dump all this paper in there with all the other stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1789.559s">It's</a>  not, it's a contaminated, more contaminated than a dual stream. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1793.903s">And</a>  then there's a multi stream, which is, did we look into dual stream? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1797.746s">Cause</a>  I know that's available in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1799.987s">I</a>  looked up a chart on the DEP. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1802.738s">nasty</a>  ep and i don't know if that was because you get a better product where you divide in your bottles your cans and your plastic um so i don't know if that was considered or not that would be bonus it seemed to be it would be better recycling uh cleaner non-contaminated thank you thank you um</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1823.222s">So,</a>  we did go through a lengthy RFP process just to make sure folks understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1827.304s">So,</a>  lots of things were considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1829.204s">So,</a>  the RFP process was comprehensive and lengthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1833.666s">So,</a>  any of that information?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1835.267s">It</a>  was comprehensive, but did it consider other streams, or?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1839.228s">Yeah,</a>  comprehensive, that's what that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1840.548s">So,</a>  all options were considered, yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1842.829s">All</a>  right, because single stream, I was never for single stream. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1846.251s">I</a>  remember when we did paper, and we did our bottles and our cans and separate bins, and I was very happy with that.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1852.773s">Thank</a>  you, Jim. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1853.494s">All</a>  right, we're going to move on to Ted Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1857.017s">So,</a>  Ted, I'm going to ask you to unmute if you could let us know your name and address. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1860.58s">You'll</a>  have two minutes to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1861.781s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1864.37s">Hi,</a>  Ted Blake, Toro Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1867.951s">I'm</a>  going to skip some of the things that other people have said, concerns, dumping was one of the ones, concerns about single stream plastics, like, you know, making sure this is addressed, not just on the citizens, but you know, the residents, but on the grocery stores and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1882.976s">The</a>  two other things that I just wanted to chime in that haven't been mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1886.517s">Number</a>  one, kind of going along with dumping is just the idea of like, I anticipate, I don't know, people just like filling up the bins at the parks and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1894.539s">And</a>  so I'm just wondering if that's taken into account, just like if that there's going to be increased volume there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1898.78s">And</a>  the second one was if there's any potential solution for having a transfer station that's open to residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1906.602s">I</a>  know other towns have transfer stations you can bring things to or instead of the pay-as-you-go bags. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1914.084s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1915.833s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1916.193s">And</a>  just to make sure folks know, a transfer station requires land and a whole different set of permitting, so we don't have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1923.599s">Anyway,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1925.341s">We're</a>  gonna move on to Christian's iPhone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1928.564s">iPhone,</a>  when I unmute you, if you could list your name and address, and you'll have two minutes, thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1938.812s">Christian.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1940.213s">Did</a>  I say Christian? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1940.894s">I</a>  meant Christine, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Chris Bennett]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1942.617s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1943.097s">I</a>  was got a little confused by that.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1946.039s">I</a>  don't know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1946.719s">I</a>  think, you know, I'm just starting to cross.</p>

    <p>[Chris Bennett]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1950.361s">Well,</a>  one, you know, a couple of the things I wanted to go over was, uh, using this single stream recycling. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1957.885s">I'm</a>  thinking like how much money we could probably get just on paper and cardboard alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1963.788s">I</a>  mean, a lot of cities and towns use that, but by using a single, we're wasting just the paper, you know, the chance of getting paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1972.458s">I'm</a>  sorry?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1972.899s">I</a>  think that was a rogue microphone.</p>

    <p>[Chris Bennett]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1976.522s">So</a>  I just wanted to know, like, we're using single stream, we could be getting money back on paper and cardboard and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1984.431s">I</a>  wanted to know, the city is paying for the concurrent composting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1987.835s">I</a>  know that we received a grant, but what will the future cost be? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1992.93s">I</a>  just wanted to get that question out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=1995.131s">And</a>  then, Mr. McGiven, I know that you've questioned a couple of people saying, you know, what was it that they were talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2001.856s">What</a>  was it in regards to? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2003.737s">And</a>  I think the actual advertisement for this particular Zoom said, if you wanted, we wanted to hear about our upcoming changes to our waste collection system. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2012.342s">So</a>  I would assume that it would always be regarding the once every two week pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2019.151s">That's</a>  why I asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2019.832s">I</a>  wanted to be sure because we also have universal comprosses part of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2023.474s">Yeah,</a>  but that's not that people have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2025.415s">It's</a>  the major concern is that you're asking people to pick up once every other week and that would be, you know, that that's the part that would impact most people.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2033.461s">And</a>  that's exactly why I'm asking folks to clarify to make sure that that goes on record. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2036.723s">If</a>  that's the concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2038.744s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2038.964s">That's</a>  exactly why I'm asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2039.985s">Thank</a>  you, ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2041.006s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2042.387s">On</a>  to Ralph Klein. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2044.008s">So</a>  Ralph Klein, if, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2046.013s">You</a>  could give us your name and address, and you'll have two minutes when I ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2050.837s">Can</a>  you hear me?</p>

    <p>[Ralph Klein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2061.325s">Hi,</a>  Ralph. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2062.246s">Yeah,</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2063.707s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2064.548s">Yeah,</a>  my concern is with this every other week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2068.111s">I</a>  think it's absolutely ridiculous for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2071.754s">For</a>  a bin that's <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2074.664s">uh,</a>  composting bin. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2075.685s">That's</a>  one 10th the size of the regular barrel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2078.427s">You</a>  think people are going to reduce their trash by half per week? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2082.669s">That's</a>  a little unrealistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2084.731s">I</a>  remember the composting we did back in the sixties. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2089.134s">We</a>  had a bin thing bucket in your backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2091.255s">I</a>  gave pictures to the city council of the bin. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2094.457s">You</a>  take it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2095.438s">The</a>  swill wagon would go down the street and would stink the street up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2099.0s">Now</a>  you have all this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2100.902s">You</a>  think every week it's supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2103.354s">from</a>  my understanding, but trashes every other week? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2106.637s">Why</a>  is this one-tenth size bin and cuts the trash in half? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2113.645s">That's</a>  totally unrealistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2115.887s">The</a>  second problem is rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2117.649s">Wherever</a>  you have construction, you have rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2120.471s">Route</a>  93, when they redid the rotary, the rats went over to the church. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2124.482s">and</a>  all that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2126.123s">On</a>  Salem Street, when they did the sink building, they're now doing the building on the corner of Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2131.746s">They're</a>  talking about doing another one down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2133.667s">That's</a>  gonna bring rats into the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2135.228s">People</a>  say, oh no, it doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2137.649s">We</a>  don't have a rat problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2139.35s">Yeah,</a>  we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2140.23s">I've</a>  seen more rats around here than I have in years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2143.572s">I</a>  mean, it's crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2145.013s">And</a>  they're saying, oh, well, we can strip. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2147.174s">Well,</a>  why not make a third collection bin? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2151.569s">for</a>  trash, for the plastic recyclables, for the styrofoam. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2154.991s">That</a>  way there, or give us a drop-off spot for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2157.152s">You</a>  have a dumpster for cardboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2159.353s">Why</a>  can't you put another dumpster full of trash? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2162.555s">And</a>  overflow styrofoam or the plastics to be recycled. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2166.857s">It</a>  eliminates part of your problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2168.337s">I</a>  mean, sit in this instinct. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2170.859s">Yeah,</a>  it's wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2171.579s">It's</a>  small. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2172.019s">Everybody</a>  has a garbage disposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2173.8s">For</a>  the amount you're gonna put in it, it's ridiculous to say, oh, every other week.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2178.943s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2180.669s">Thank</a>  you, Ralph. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2181.17s">Appreciate</a>  the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2183.332s">Okay,</a>  we're going to move on to Gianna Salvalletti. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2187.537s">Gianna,</a>  when I ask you to unmute, if you could give us your name and address, you'll have two minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2195.809s">Hello,</a>  I'm Chiana Salveletti, Tamar Drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2198.73s">I</a>  turned to plus plus most of the concerns others have raised tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2202.811s">I'm</a>  very concerned about the impact this will have on public health and the rodent situation in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2207.452s">I</a>  have a dog and last summer has been by mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2210.733s">And</a>  so we had to wait for the next week for it to be picked up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2213.434s">And</a>  in the summer heat, I ended up getting maggots in my bin. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2216.375s">And</a>  I'm super concerned that this would become the norm with this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2219.496s">And</a>  after today's presentation, it sounds like a good area for improvement for our current trash strategy is resolving the contaminated recycling. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2227.185s">At</a>  this point, if folks aren't recycling correctly, I don't have much hope that they'll be able to handle bi-weekly trash responsibly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2234.634s">But</a>  I think that would be a good place to say we should create milestones that we must achieve before implementing something this drastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2241.776s">And</a>  lastly, I feel like it wasn't previously communicated properly that the Massachusetts Food Waste Ban was just a proposal, and that's how it was presented today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2251.839s">And</a>  by drastically changing our trash schedule this early on, I feel like we're being overly proactive for something that's just in the proposal phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2259.461s">I</a>  think there are much easier milestones we could achieve as a city to positively impact the environment without posing such a significant risk this early on to our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2268.447s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2409.899s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2410.66s">All</a>  right, there's a written comment from Alessandra. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2415.863s">I</a>  want to read that was the person that on so she submitted a written comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2419.646s">I'm</a>  going to go ahead and read that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2420.946s">And</a>  I also want to clarify that for compost, we don't pay for the tonnage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2425.69s">So</a>  we're not the tonnage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2427.811s">That's</a>  important for folks to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2429.492s">So</a>  it sounds like there was a misunderstanding out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2432.234s">So,</a>  um. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2433.693s">I'll</a>  go ahead and read this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2434.973s">This</a>  is from Alessandra. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2436.714s">I</a>  want to know how they're going to deal with the Tufts population around here, with four and five adults per apartment throwing out trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2444.657s">I</a>  live on Yale Street in South Merritt, surrounded by two family houses rented to students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2450.319s">Landlords</a>  are absent, and there's no communication to them about this upcoming change in trash pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2455.86s">The</a>  landlord of their neighborhood, or even their own properties, in many cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2460.874s">Additionally,</a>  the communication around this was not optimal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2464.115s">We</a>  are hearing about this and the decision has been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2466.776s">Why</a>  weren't residents allowed to vote on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2470.158s">Thank</a>  you, Alessandro. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2470.958s">Okay,</a>  we're going to move to Natarajan, Pravitha Natarajan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2479.001s">I'm</a>  going to ask you to unmute if you could let us know your name in a few minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2483.663s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2487.813s">Hi,</a>  this is Pravita. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2490.937s">I</a>  live on Osborne Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2493.18s">I</a>  wanted to voice my support for this plan, but I also understand the concerns from a lot of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2499.807s">I</a>  understand change is hard, but we can do hard things for the greater good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2505.653s">I</a>  wanted to talk about a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2507.794s">I</a>  think the cost perspective, we spoke about that, and it is going to save the city a lot of cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2513.177s">But</a>  also one thing I wanted to highlight is that, unfortunately, trash is not something that is out of sight, out of mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2520.46s">We</a>  spoke about Asaga's incinerator, which means they are enclosed to the incinerator. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2526.703s">landfill</a>  stations and everything that's getting burned is affecting their air and water quality and there is a health impact for communities that live next to the incinerators. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2537.249s">So</a>  by reducing our trash we are indirectly helping them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2542.292s">Another</a>  thing I wanted to suggest was that potentially the city can also, so the rat problem has been raised and it is a real issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2552.019s">Composting</a>  well can prevent rats from getting into your compost, but also would the city also help residents replace kind of damaged or compromised trash cans, so that could keep rats away from their trash cans, potentially with dog poop and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2570.312s">And</a>  then finally, I wanted to say that a small group of Medford residents, we have started an initiative called Zero Waste Medford to work with the residents and help them learn about ways to reduce. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2582.154s">Look</a>  forward to the opportunity to work with the city as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2585.155s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2587.035s">Thank</a>  you for those offers, Praveeta. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2590.235s">And</a>  we appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2591.376s">We're</a>  going to move on to Niver, she, her. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2595.176s">Niver,</a>  I'm going to ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2597.036s">If</a>  you could give us your name and address, you'll have two minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2602.435s">Hi,</a>  I'm new there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2604.417s">I</a>  live at I live on Hicks have and I wanted to a lot of what people said, I really appreciate the thought that has gone into this and you soliciting opinions now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2616.85s">And</a>  I think it's a really good idea for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2619.593s">us</a>  to be thinking about reducing our waste stream. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2621.995s">I</a>  have been trying to do that all my life basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2625.958s">But</a>  I am concerned particularly about the aspect of these changes for single family condo townhome owners like myself who are not going to have access to trash and recycling services anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2642.512s">So</a>  basically <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2643.773s">will</a>  still be paying the same taxes to subsidize everyone else's trash and recycling services and then we'll also have to pay for our own trash and recycling. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2653.902s">And</a>  if we want to compost on top of that will then also have to pay for that and I'm just concerned that that's accessible to me and I wanted to boost some of what other people have said about <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2664.912s">providing</a>  other options. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2666.534s">I</a>  would love to have more options of things to recycle, places to recycle them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2671.719s">I</a>  think the reuse communities people have pointed out are a really good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2676.383s">I</a>  think there are a lot of other solutions that could make this easier for people, but it does feel like someone else said like <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2687.714s">this</a>  was rolled out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2689.175s">I'm</a>  a pretty new resident I just moved here this year and it feels like almost as soon as I moved here I got told like oh you're not going to get trash and recycling or compost anymore and pay for it yourself and but keep paying the same taxes and that just didn't feel right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2707.402s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2709.503s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2727.408s">Hi,</a>  thank you for the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2729.59s">I'm</a>  Vinay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2730.591s">I'm</a>  from Osborne Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2733.394s">I</a>  am for this initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2735.896s">I</a>  think the biweekly crash is the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2739.875s">I</a>  cook a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2740.816s">And</a>  so I after the composting free composting, my compost bin gets filled up more often than my trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2747.763s">And</a>  I think the city is doing the right thing by getting ahead of this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2751.947s">Because</a>  this is something we'll eventually need to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2755.591s">I</a>  just wanted to share my opinion.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2757.093s">Is</a>  it Vinny or Vinay? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2759.97s">Oh,</a>  anyway, he's already muted, so you may never know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2763.073s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2763.694s">We're</a>  gonna move on to G.

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2774.727s">Hi,</a>  Ben Lindvig-Lingler, live on Sunset Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2777.588s">I</a>  joined a little bit late, so I'm not sure if this has been asked, but I was really curious, has the proposal been a big cost savings? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2786.032s">I</a>  was curious if the City or what the City has been doing to explore actual increased municipal revenues to ensure that we main level of service as opposed to cutting services and passing on costs to residents as was just described, whether that's <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2802.059s">In</a>  expanded containers to meet the 2 week requirement or like with the single family condo owners who have to put the bill themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2812.352s">It</a>  seems like for a city that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2814.695s">I</a>  believe we're in the bottom 10% of. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2818.123s">Uh,</a>  taxes as it relates to other municipalities in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2821.986s">We</a>  should be considering increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2823.387s">That's</a>  not a unrealistic thing to be planning for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2826.389s">So</a>  I'd really like to understand how we are increasing municipal revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2829.951s">So</a>  we don't end up having to cut, but others as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2834.155s">Also,</a>  as it relates to pests, it's not just rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2838.559s">Where</a>  we live near Tufts University, it's rats, it's squirrels. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2842.602s">They</a>  get into the existing trash bins. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2844.503s">We've</a>  had to replace the lid on our trash containers twice in the last year due to squirrels and rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2852.669s">So</a>  I think that that's only going to be increasing as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2855.931s">So</a>  I want to make sure that that's understood as a problem, not just being rats, but other pests. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2862.979s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_33]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2883.319s">Hi,</a>  Chris from Winchester Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2886.543s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2888.062s">I</a>  would just like to start off by saying this until a couple of weeks ago when it was on the news, radio, WBZ, television. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2897.335s">I</a>  think this even made Jimmy Kimmel late night. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2900.339s">It's</a>  even being reported worldwide. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2903.163s">I</a>  think that it's kind of a crazy idea to go to every two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2910.049s">I</a>  don't know where the survey came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2911.97s">Was</a>  it mailed to the house or what? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2913.792s">Never</a>  heard of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2915.053s">The</a>  whole thing that I heard about this was media just a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2921.358s">So</a>  I don't know how long you've been working on this, but <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2925.008s">You</a>  gotta look at how long has the public known about what you guys are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2932.05s">I</a>  do not feel that trash pickup every two weeks is a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2938.271s">People</a>  have been talking about all the reasons why it's negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2941.972s">Rats,</a>  there's rats everywhere in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2945.045s">I</a>  don't know how you guys don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2947.066s">There's</a>  the raccoons, as the other gentleman just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2952.328s">There's</a>  stuff, you know, mattresses just dumped to pay a hundred bucks to get rid of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2959.771s">I</a>  just think that the whole way this is being put out to the people is just not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2965.593s">You</a>  can really take a hard look at yourselves for just throwing this out at the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2972.396s">And,</a>  you know, the other thing that's been brought up is the absentee landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2976.479s">A</a>  ton of them in South Medford, all over Medford, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2979.621s">A</a>  ton of them in South Medford with Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2982.083s">They</a>  couldn't care a crap less about trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2985.065s">Trash</a>  is everywhere over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2987.727s">I</a>  think you really got to take a hard look at maybe putting this on the ballot for the residents to, rather than having this forced on them.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2997.574s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2998.907s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2999.207s">Appreciate</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=2999.828s">I</a>  have a raccoon that lives near my house too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3002.789s">So</a>  I know the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3005.091s">Thank</a>  you for your feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3006.351s">And</a>  also my department picks up and pays for those, uh, those dumped mattresses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3011.715s">So</a>  I, and I feel them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3014.776s">Uh,</a>  so that's, that's pretty deep there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3016.918s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3017.238s">So</a>  I'm going to move on to Sarah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3020.019s">Calico</a>  asking on mute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3023.261s">And</a>  if you could give us your name and address, you'll have two minutes to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3025.703s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3029.255s">Yes,</a>  my name is Sarah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3030.656s">I'm</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3032.697s">I</a>  am not in favor at this time for the every other week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3036.66s">Trash</a>  I do already do the composting and we do do the line here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3042.584s">I'm.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3044.105s">In</a>  South Medford, and we have over the past couple of years notice quite the uptick and. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3049.164s">different</a>  rodents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3050.025s">So</a>  I want to know before something like this goes into effect, what is the city going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3055.688s">I</a>  have logged requests, I have neighbors have logged requests, nothing is being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3059.49s">I</a>  have a whole series of port-a-potty outside of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3063.492s">And</a>  I was told that was going to be gone two weeks and I'm still staring at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3068.315s">They</a>  assure me that that's not going to increase, but I can sure tell you on my ring cameras, I can see them every day running in and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3074.478s">And</a>  there's just been no accountability by the city and it's really, really frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3078.863s">Neighbors</a>  were very clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3080.245s">There</a>  are some neighbors that rent down the street so I'm sure that some of this could be coming from there as well but it's only going to get worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3087.173s">I</a>  also have animals pick the waste removal but also. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3090.857s">To</a>  the woman who has the elderly mother, I really feel for her and that is a lot of supplies and that's a lot of waste and it's terrible when it's in your home. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3100.726s">You're</a>  trying to do your best to take care of them and what are we going to do for these family members? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3104.549s">This</a>  really needs to be considered and the communication needs to be better. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3109.013s">The</a>  survey was <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3111.395s">disgraceful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3112.295s">It</a>  was so unprofessionally written for a bunch of people who are on a board that are very well educated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3118.877s">So</a>  I suggest someone go look into revising that document going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3123.958s">Additionally,</a>  I don't know how much of a 20 seconds left is not everyone goes online, not a phone that text messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3130.199s">So</a>  then we need to get to the residents that don't text, don't do QR codes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3135.681s">Like</a>  it may be 2026 that many people can't even afford a phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3138.861s">We</a>  need better communication to all of our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3141.262s">Bye</a>  guys.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3143.523s">Thank</a>  you, Sarah, just to just to address a couple of well, 1 thing that you said, the board of health has been doing a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3151.065s">I</a>  know on rodents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3152.805s">So,</a>  I know you don't think that we're doing anything, but I'm not both, but there's lots of resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3159.227s">They're</a>  doing lots of citywide initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3161.527s">We</a>  do help with them with some, even the mapping of the incidences in the DPW and also closed containers that hold our food waste is part of reducing rodents as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3171.95s">I</a>  know a lot of people believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3174.05s">that</a>  rodents will increase when you separate and contain the food waste, but that's not what they're finding out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3180.596s">No,</a>  I'm more concerned about... Sorry, I should have muted you, I'm just trying to address the things that you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3187.801s">The</a>  ordinance, the Board of Health and the City Council just passed a rodent control ordinance too, that's a bolstering of a previous ordinance that they had, so there's a lot of action happening there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3196.648s">The</a>  engineering division about that port-a-potty, if you haven't already, <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3199.37s">That</a>  sounds like it might be a construction project from the engineering division. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3203.592s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3204.553s">I'm</a>  going to move on to Dylan Compton. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3207.034s">Dylan,</a>  if you could give your name and address and let us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3211.737s">Sorry,</a>  yeah, your name and address, and you'll have two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3213.518s">Thank</a>  you, Dylan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3216.834s">Yeah,</a>  hi Tim, thanks for taking comments tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3220.297s">Dylan</a>  Compton, I live on Sunset Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3223.759s">Echo,</a>  you know, a lot of the other comments and concerns tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3227.662s">I</a>  compost, I recycle, I actually don't run out of space in my trash can, but to me I think there's a huge amount of dogs in the neighborhood, there's <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3241.693s">human</a>  waste there's things that become quite odorous and so my concern is almost exclusively with the frequency of pickup and not the the waste reduction goals and so um you know one of my sort of you know you phrase this is looking for questions you've been getting a lot of comments i appreciate you you hanging with us um i think one of my questions is what would it take for us to look at <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3266.603s">smaller</a>  cart sizes on a weekly basis as opposed to a bi-weekly system and like what would the relative cost savings there be if just the tonnage reduction versus the the pickup frequency reduction because that to me feels like potentially a very workable alternative <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3282.515s">that</a>  would address a lot of the commute concerns around the waste. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3285.637s">I</a>  think there's still volume concerns, but that's where pay-as-you-throw really is structured well to solve for that, potentially, where the frequency, it really isn't, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3294.742s">There's</a>  not an option for me to go out and say, hey, I want somebody to pick up my dog's, you know, poop every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3301.426s">I</a>  mean, there's a couple private services for picking up in your yard stuff that we put in our trash right now, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3307.249s">And</a>  so, yeah, I think that's my core question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3309.77s">Broadly,</a>  I understand where this is coming from and appreciate the city trying to solve for it, but would really like to see us think creatively about how to keep the frequency higher and achieve those tonnage in other ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3323.935s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3325.356s">Thank</a>  you, Dylan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3325.876s">Appreciate</a>  the feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3328.497s">All</a>  right, we'll move to Charlotte Cahill. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3330.738s">Charlotte,</a>  if you could give us your name, you'll have two minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3336.947s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3338.108s">Charlotte</a>  Cahill, Central Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3340.351s">I</a>  am sneaking in a second comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3341.933s">I</a>  didn't be able to get away with it, but I'll make it really short.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3344.115s">One</a>  is to just say, and I appreciate the fact check on my previous comment where I had the proportion</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3358.471s">of</a>  households represented by the city's composting goal wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3361.395s">Remind</a>  my sort of larger concern about like, there's going to be food waste in the trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3367.944s">And</a>  like, 100% compliance is not real, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3371.409s">I</a>  think your comments still made sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3373.972s">The</a>  other point I wanted to make was just to say, and really echoing some of what just before me, is I would love to have more information in whatever FAQ or whatever else you put together on what alternatives to biweekly pickup the city has considered and why you decided against them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3397.197s">So</a>  I appreciate here the waste reduction goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3400.798s">I</a>  think that a lot of the comments we're hearing are not pushing back on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3404.982s">They're</a>  pushing back on this particular biweekly approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3408.746s">And</a>  so it would just be really helpful to understand kind of why you thought this was the approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3414.391s">And</a>  I think about, you know, lots of other communities in Massachusetts have pay-as-you-throw. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3420.517s">Very</a>  few of them are right here in the Boston area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3423.6s">I</a>  know Malden and Brookline are in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3426.222s">And</a>  I know Malden at least has chosen to maintain weekly trash pickup at a lower volume, so I'm just curious about kind of what the options are and why you think this is the right one for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3437.251s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3440.41s">Just</a>  Charlie, just let you know, your comment did make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3442.231s">I</a>  just needed to correct that fact, just so folks had the correct information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3447.073s">People</a>  bringing it up, keep it every week, but reduce the volume. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3452.555s">That</a>  is an option that was looked at closely, many options. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3457.197s">And</a>  just so folks know, the cost of collection is a lot higher than the cost of disposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3465.86s">That</a>  information is out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3467.581s">Some</a>  was presented tonight and then there'll be more detailed information on the FAQ. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3471.824s">I'm</a>  sure once we're done with tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3473.485s">It's</a>  a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3473.965s">It's</a>  a lot of people seem to be interested in that, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3476.627s">I</a>  love the brainstorming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3477.587s">I</a>  love the ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3478.568s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3479.368s">We're</a>  going to move to big Haas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3482.81s">Hopefully</a>  that's your real name, big Haas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3485.372s">And</a>  we're going to, if you could let us know your name and address and you'll have two minutes to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3498.323s">because</a>  it looks like maybe you clicked it and then clicked it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3500.603s">So</a>  I'm going to ask to unmute again and just this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3512.706s">All</a>  right, well, I'm going to put your hand down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3514.946s">If</a>  you would like to try again, please put your hand back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3517.387s">Okay,</a>  I'm going to move to G Turk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3522.908s">G</a>  Turk, I'm going to unmute you and please let us know your name and address and you'll have two minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3532.802s">Yes,</a>  hi, my name is Gilbert and I'm a Turk and I live on Woods Road in Metzl. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3541.104s">And,</a>  you know, I, you know, I watched the presentation by, you know, environmental issues and, you know, mainly, you know, we want to reduce our waste and we want to reduce everything is done in a proper way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3556.707s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3558.326s">again,</a>  you know, as many other citizens and, you know, express the same concern about rodents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3564.848s">I</a>  mean, last year, we had raccoon in our trash bins, summertime when it's really hot, it's terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3572.73s">And</a>  yeah, I mean, you know, I understand, you know, that, you know, I mean, we're not, you know, I don't think <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3581.668s">We</a>  were consulted before this program was implemented, and to convince people that having trucks that were run once every other week would put less strain on streets and roads and would cut down pollution, I mean, it's a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3601.708s">You</a>  know, again, we're paying also more property taxes and getting less services. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3607.01s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3608.03s">Yeah,</a>  go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3609.471s">And</a>  I understand cities have big trouble closing their budgets, the cost of living everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3615.953s">But</a>  I believe there's way better ideas to implement stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3620.834s">And</a>  certainly, the every other week, you know, program is not the right one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3627.236s">And</a>  I believe, you know, Metro <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3632.78s">only</a>  city which are going to this direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3637.624s">I'm</a>  not sure what the result is going to be, but I mean, will you allow to, I mean, to change course if things will not go the right way? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3649.713s">I</a>  mean, we're open to anything new, but I don't know.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3655.177s">Thank</a>  you, G-Turk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3656.198s">We</a>  appreciate the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3658.04s">And</a>  this is, I'm going to say something, but it's nothing to do with what you just said, just in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3662.62s">just</a>  been notified maybe they're aware of it didn't seem like it to me and they were masked if and there's only a few more speakers left but no personal attacks no veiled personal attacks we're all people we're trying to do our job here okay so thank you um we're gonna move to i believe he has a new comment to make so i'm gonna i'm gonna uh ask him to unmute and if you could just say your name and address again thank you vinnie</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3692.507s">Thanks,</a>  Tim. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3693.208s">My</a>  name is pronounced Vinay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3697.831s">But</a>  I also wanted to add to my previous comment that I only put my trash out once or twice a month now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3705.698s">And</a>  I have three big dogs and all of their dog poop goes in the trash bin. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3710.758s">And</a>  we don't have a rat problem here in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3714.44s">And</a>  I think it's because my trash can is in good condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3717.963s">And</a>  someone else also mentioned before that when used in a secure container, that really restricts the amount of rats or food that critters in general have access to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3728.089s">I</a>  tried to get to the compost bin, but it was secure enough that it couldn't open it, figure out how to open it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3735.534s">And</a>  I wanted to share that as well.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3737.895s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3738.676s">Appreciate</a>  your comments and your feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3743.075s">Okay,</a>  Ralph Klein, I believe Ralph spoke, but he may have a new comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3747.056s">So</a>  I'm going to ask him if he could give us his name and address again, and I'll have two minutes.</p>

    <p>[Ralph Klein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3754.938s">Hi,</a>  can you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3756.798s">I</a>  can. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3757.778s">Well,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3759.459s">All</a>  these comments about, you know, the plastic bins, the old containers they used to pick up with metal, they got into them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3766.0s">My</a>  trash bins have very little food in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3769.977s">But</a>  there are animals that have chewed through the plastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3772.958s">So</a>  these plastic bins should not be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3776.1s">They're</a>  chewing through the regular trash barrels. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3778.781s">What</a>  makes you think they're not going to chew through these plastics after a while when they find out there's food in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3783.823s">The</a>  other thing is all these heavy trash trucks going down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3787.124s">They're</a>  saying, yeah, how heavy are they going to be every other week? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3791.366s">You're</a>  not reducing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3792.806s">You're</a>  just pushing it into another week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3795.487s">All</a>  the other things come from, <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3797.632s">stores</a>  really that are open. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3798.913s">Our</a>  stores are closed and left and right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3800.354s">Everything</a>  comes from Amazon wherever. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3802.797s">That's</a>  where everything, that's where all this trash is generated from. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3806.42s">We</a>  need to stop local shopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3810.203s">Stop</a>  and shop where they have the food delivered. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3812.486s">They</a>  put it in boxes to get rid of their boxes when they deliver it to home. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3816.902s">I</a>  mean, all we have is all these other trucks going down the streets and everybody thinks the electric vehicles are great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3823.048s">They're</a>  destroying our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3824.329s">They're</a>  destroying them in California, that roads in the summer here, the electric vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3829.534s">And</a>  if they're going to electric trucks, they're even heavier. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3832.476s">They're</a>  going to destroy our roads even more. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3835.239s">So</a>  why not reduce it by half what you're doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3838.982s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3840.864s">Appreciate</a>  the comments, Ralph. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3842.829s">have</a>  been studying weights of vehicles for a while, and the weight of the vehicles matters, but the number of trips also matters, and the movements, the wheel friction on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3853.475s">So</a>  there's lots of impacts to roads, not the environment per se. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3857.277s">Anyway,</a>  I will move on to Gary. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3859.398s">Gary,</a>  when <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3863.333s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3864.073s">Oh,</a>  yeah, maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3864.794s">Who's</a>  this? <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3866.175s">Gary?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3867.016s">This</a>  is Gary. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3867.657s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3868.237s">Oh,</a>  I didn't even know you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3869.178s">Someone</a>  else must have.</p>

    <p>[Gary Marinelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3869.839s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3872.401s">Hi,</a>  Gary. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3873.583s">I'm</a>  here tonight to speak against the proposal to reduce the trash pickup schedule to every other week on the surface, although cutting back may sound like a simple way to save money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3885.454s">In</a>  practice, it creates far more problems than it solves. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3889.577s">Problems</a>  that affect public health, neighborhood cleanliness, and overall quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3895.72s">First,</a>  less frequent trash pickups means more waste sitting longer in homes and on our curbs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3903.085s">That</a>  leads to overflowing bins, very unpleasant odors, and increased pests. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3908.948s">We</a>  already have rats, raccoons, insects, and bugs near Salem Street and in Fellsway, and these are not minor inconveniences. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3917.974s">They're</a>  real health concerns, especially for families with children sleeping in multifamily homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3924.219s">Second,</a>  reducing pickup does not reduce waste. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3928.621s">It</a>  just shifts the burdens onto the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3931.103s">Families</a>  will be forced to store more trash for longer periods, which is not realistic for most households. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3938.127s">Many</a>  properties also lack extra storage, and the community relies on regular disposal <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3945.017s">and</a>  will struggle to stay clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3947.638s">Third,</a>  this change risks making our community look neglected. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3952.859s">Overflowing</a>  bins and illegal dumping become much more common when people don't have adequate disposal options. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3960.942s">That</a>  hurts property values and undermines the pride we take in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3965.803s">At</a>  my home, we already recycle, and we're already signed up for composting, even always full. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3972.065s">There's</a>  never a week when our bin is not full. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3975.066s">We</a>  have two young children who are in diapers, and it's all quite awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3981.668s">Our</a>  bin already smells awful as is, and I can't imagine what it would be like with every other week pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3987.89s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3989.111s">Thank</a>  you, Gary. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3989.671s">Appreciate</a>  your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3991.111s">I'm</a>  going to move to <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3994.542s">It's</a>  all one word, Judith Weinstock. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=3998.928s">Judith,</a>  I'm going to ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4000.471s">If</a>  you could give us your name and address for the record, and you'll have two minutes to speak.</p>

    <p>[Judith Weinstock]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4008.427s">Hi,</a>  my name is Judith Weinstock. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4009.887s">I</a>  live at 144 Burgett. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4012.268s">I'm</a>  actually a little surprised, not at the comments about going to every other week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4019.35s">I</a>  actually think the city seriously needs to revisit that if it's not too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4023.751s">In</a>  other words, if a contract's already been signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4026.912s">then</a>  this is all somewhat moot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4029.353s">But</a>  I would like to comment on the composting program, which I think is pretty phenomenal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4036.817s">And</a>  I just want to focus on it first. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4038.777s">There's</a>  some kudos deserved by the city and by the company that you've contracted with. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4044.54s">I</a>  only started doing it about three months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4047.501s">It</a>  was remarkable how easy I found it, but I think that the city could actually work <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4053.704s">much</a>  harder on encouraging many, many, many more houses to do it because it is a relatively simple program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4060.568s">But</a>  I also think that the city, just as you did with rain barrel options for people years ago, people do have to go out, they have to buy a bin for their internal collection, they have to buy those bags, they have to buy the bags for the bin that you provide for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4077.277s">And</a>  I think it would be great if the city could provide some additional resources, potentially bulk buying and discounting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4083.56s">for</a>  in-home bins that people have to use for that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4087.865s">I</a>  would love to see the city at this point, with all this feedback, decouple these programs and begin to focus 100% on increasing the number of households who are doing composting <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4100.057s">now</a>  and for the future and work longer and harder on solving some of the really important issues at PNight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4108.261s">I</a>  think they're legitimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4110.142s">They</a>  don't affect me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4111.183s">I'm</a>  a single-person household. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4113.084s">I</a>  don't fill my bin. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4114.644s">Please</a>  don't come by and drop your stuff here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4118.146s">But</a>  I really think you're hearing some really serious concerns that need serious fixes before you implement the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4125.63s">Thank</a>  you very much for that.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4128.752s">Thank</a>  you, Judith. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4130.817s">We'll</a>  say comments and feedback are not moot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4135.422s">We're</a>  trying to identify gaps, respond to feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4138.165s">There's</a>  flexibility within the signed contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4140.927s">There</a>  are contractual dates and milestones that we have to meet certain things and make certain decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4146.813s">And</a>  because of the pay-as-you-throw relationship, it's actually been coupled as opposed to decoupled because they feed off of each other and it's part of one whole program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4159.022s">So</a>  hopefully that helps clarify things for folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4162.905s">Definitely</a>  not moot at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4164.567s">This</a>  information is incredibly valuable to us, to apps, and take those flexibilities and continue to design the program over the next year and a half, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4174.094s">So</a>  that's what we're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4176.59s">That's</a>  everybody who has their hands up and I'll just give, it's 8, 10, if there are other folks who would like to speak, now's your chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4188.14s">If</a>  not, I'm gonna, I suppose, I don't know if we have, I don't recall if we had any closing planned, but I don't know if Steve, you wanted to say anything or anybody else wanted to say anything or if we should just log off.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4200.866s">Kim,</a>  we have one other comment from the person, Big Hoss, who had trouble, do you want me to just read that one?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4208.949s">Sure,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4211.129s">My</a>  name is Amy and I live on Princeton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4214.29s">I</a>  do not have a resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4215.271s">He</a>  should have muted her so that he could speak over her. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4218.072s">There</a>  seems to be a huge disregard for the residents you are serving. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4221.953s">I</a>  am a mother and can't tell you how many trash weekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4224.874s">It's</a>  insane to announce this during a cost of living crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4228.113s">for</a>  the population of your residence, which is families, elders, and students.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4233.479s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4234.4s">Just</a>  to clarify, I was not being disrespectful in any sense of the word. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4238.022s">The</a>  mechanics of this particular meeting and the way it was formatted doesn't give me particularly a lot of flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4244.386s">That's</a>  how we agreed to have a Q&A open dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4247.528s">It's</a>  really to receive feedback, and my role is to correct things that maybe are facts that are wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4254.572s">So</a>  hopefully that explains it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4256.734s">I</a>  certainly didn't mean anybody any disrespect whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4259.916s">So</a>  I hope you can appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4262.397s">With</a>  that said, if there's nobody else to speak tonight, we can wrap it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4269.556s">And</a>  we have other <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4272.553s">Scheduled</a>  events January 28th is at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4276.575s">That's</a>  at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4277.836s">January</a>  28th at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4280.397s">Medford</a>  City Hall, City Council Chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4283.358s">There</a>  were a lot of comments or a few comments at the beginning about how this was only on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4287.88s">It's</a>  not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4288.22s">There's</a>  educational workshops that are going to be taking place as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4291.441s">There's</a>  lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4294.203s">So</a>  we appreciate everybody's feedback tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4297.144s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ir8Km2ErkFk&t=4301.403s">Steve,</a>  do you wanna call it, say goodnight?</p>
