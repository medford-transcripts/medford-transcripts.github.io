1
00:00:00,251 --> 00:00:02,312
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that's a school committee meeting.

2
00:00:02,392 --> 00:00:08,756
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you're not listening to this, um, so I just, right.

3
00:00:09,256 --> 00:00:15,399
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, so I would like to know what's going to happen with my big thing is animal waste.

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,680
[SPEAKER_17]: I already have holes in my barrel.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,561
[SPEAKER_17]: The rats have already chewed through.

6
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:22,603
[SPEAKER_17]: And so what do we do?

7
00:00:22,703 --> 00:00:26,745
[SPEAKER_17]: Like cat waste, dog waste, baby diapers, because

8
00:00:27,523 --> 00:00:33,447
[SPEAKER_17]: When we had people come around here to handle the rats, they said the big thing is like dog waste.

9
00:00:33,507 --> 00:00:35,688
[SPEAKER_17]: Make sure you pick up your dog waste, you throw it out.

10
00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:43,794
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we do that, but now in the rats, it's just gonna attract them more to the barrels that they chew through.

11
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,276
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't put, use a disposal.

12
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:55,181
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't throw food outside, but we have a bigger family and we're always full at the end of the week.

13
00:00:56,392 --> 00:01:06,660
[SPEAKER_17]: So i'm not sure How this is going to work And for these questions, are you going to like put them online to kind of eat what we're asking?

14
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:12,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we're going to be updating the frequently asked questions section that's on the website.

15
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:15,323
[SPEAKER_14]: And the website is on that slide there.

16
00:01:15,383 --> 00:01:15,524
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

17
00:01:15,764 --> 00:01:18,266
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's a lot of feedback, just so everybody realizes it's worth repeating.

18
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,367
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of feedback, a lot of people want to speak.

19
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:26,532
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're trying to, you know, take the most common frequent question answers.

20
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:32,817
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we don't have answers, as was mentioned before, or if there's a gap somewhere, then we're going to try to

21
00:01:33,497 --> 00:01:36,801
[SPEAKER_14]: fill that and make updates as needed.

22
00:01:37,262 --> 00:01:39,524
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's really what the goal is here.

23
00:01:39,544 --> 00:01:40,265
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

24
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:42,568
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you, Jessica.

25
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:43,789
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome.

26
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,350
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

27
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,872
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to mute you and lower your hand.

28
00:01:47,113 --> 00:01:49,696
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we're going to move to Daniel.

29
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:53,341
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't see the whole name, actually, unless I go.

30
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:04,084
[SPEAKER_14]: One second, Daniel Rosenwig.

31
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:12,070
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, I'm Daniel Rosenswig.

32
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,791
[SPEAKER_23]: I live on Wilson Street.

33
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:19,175
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm native to the greater Boston area, but pretty new to Medford specifically.

34
00:02:19,815 --> 00:02:21,096
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm already composting.

35
00:02:21,156 --> 00:02:22,217
[SPEAKER_23]: That's a great program.

36
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:22,778
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

37
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:28,882
[SPEAKER_23]: Trash cost is for collection versus how much for disposal.

38
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:39,575
[SPEAKER_23]: Along the same lines of Robert, who spoke recently, I'm not concerned about paying for a bit of extra volume, but I am concerned about having it sit there for two weeks.

39
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:47,000
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm particularly concerned that excess might sit outside proper containers, and therefore more exposed to animals.

40
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:57,088
[SPEAKER_23]: You have said that extra containers are available, but they only make sense if you'll overfill every week, and not if you overfill on an erratic basis.

41
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,442
[SPEAKER_23]: I do think that composting will help to reduce the volume, but I'm concerned it won't reduce it enough.

42
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:18,566
[SPEAKER_23]: Another speaker mentioned that pay as you throw has reduced waste by 32% elsewhere, but in order to make things work based on our existing consumption, it would have to be reduced by 50%.

43
00:03:20,086 --> 00:03:21,086
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's a lot.

44
00:03:21,947 --> 00:03:26,908
[SPEAKER_23]: I also think that our waste limits should be dependent on the number of residents.

45
00:03:30,097 --> 00:03:33,798
[SPEAKER_23]: for a two-person household might not make sense for a six-person family.

46
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:40,641
[SPEAKER_23]: And if we could have different limits, depending on your household size, that's a big difference for all of us.

47
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:44,962
[SPEAKER_23]: And the tighter our limits are, the more that becomes an issue.

48
00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:49,304
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, right now, if we have some spare room, maybe it's not such a big deal, the same limit.

49
00:03:49,804 --> 00:03:53,225
[SPEAKER_23]: But when it becomes really tight, I think that'll matter a lot more.

50
00:03:53,245 --> 00:03:56,187
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

51
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:57,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, Daniel.

52
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:02,949
[SPEAKER_14]: T Silvestro is next.

53
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:05,790
[SPEAKER_14]: T Silvestro, I'll ask you to unmute.

54
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Please, your name and address.

55
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

56
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:11,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello?

57
00:04:13,013 --> 00:04:13,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, welcome.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Tony Silvestro.

59
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:17,841
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 5 Royal Street in Medford.

60
00:04:18,582 --> 00:04:23,143
[SPEAKER_01]: My biggest concern is I live in South Medford and the rat population.

61
00:04:23,823 --> 00:04:30,526
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already lost one dog to leptoporosis in 2021, the pandemic with all the rats.

62
00:04:31,186 --> 00:04:33,647
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also have two dogs and I have a lot of waste.

63
00:04:33,827 --> 00:04:35,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am also a senior citizen.

64
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:41,669
[SPEAKER_01]: So my biggest concern is the senior citizens are going to be able to reel that cart out every other week.

65
00:04:44,611 --> 00:04:45,411
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be heavy.

66
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:48,033
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all kinds of crap.

67
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:52,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Pardon my language, but I just, I don't understand it.

68
00:04:52,515 --> 00:04:58,097
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're going to save money, are you going to give it back to us in our tax bill and lower our taxes?

69
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:00,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, those are my big concerns.

70
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:02,619
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but the biggest one is the rats.

71
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:05,540
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have had to hire an exterminator.

72
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:07,881
[SPEAKER_01]: I have rat boxes all around my house.

73
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:12,344
[SPEAKER_01]: The house across the street from me is an apartment building.

74
00:05:12,564 --> 00:05:14,685
[SPEAKER_01]: They have their barrels are so overfilled.

75
00:05:14,805 --> 00:05:18,287
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not funny and half of it when it blows flows down my driveway.

76
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:21,168
[SPEAKER_01]: So that those are my big concerns.

77
00:05:21,268 --> 00:05:22,849
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's about all I have to say.

78
00:05:23,429 --> 00:05:29,532
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to tell everybody please make sure your dogs process because it's not a fun thing to see your dog die from.

79
00:05:30,012 --> 00:05:30,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

80
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:35,295
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Tony.

81
00:05:36,976 --> 00:05:37,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Next up is TK.

82
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:42,996
[SPEAKER_14]: TK, when I unmute you, please, your name and address, and you'll have two minutes.

83
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:50,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, Tom Kubelos at Toro Avenue in Medford.

84
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:52,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Toro Avenue in Medford, how are you all?

85
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,681
[SPEAKER_10]: My comment is essentially around the pain.

86
00:05:56,541 --> 00:06:01,683
[SPEAKER_10]: In other Massachusetts communities, residents have the option to choose to holler.

87
00:06:07,513 --> 00:06:11,154
[SPEAKER_10]: That would mean multiple haulers could be down your street on a given day.

88
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:16,456
[SPEAKER_10]: All it takes is one home to request a haul.

89
00:06:17,397 --> 00:06:19,398
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we have two trash trucks going down the road.

90
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:22,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Has that been thought about?

91
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:29,902
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, is that built into the metrics regarding the use of trucks on roads and the damage to its targets?

92
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:30,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

93
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:33,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, TK.

94
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,366
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, next up is Erin Dalbeck.

95
00:06:38,747 --> 00:06:41,109
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to ask you to unmute, name and address for the record, please.

96
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:41,469
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

97
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:45,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi there.

98
00:06:45,692 --> 00:06:46,212
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you hear me?

99
00:06:46,232 --> 00:06:47,553
[SPEAKER_12]: I can, Erin.

100
00:06:47,593 --> 00:06:48,053
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome.

101
00:06:48,113 --> 00:06:48,453
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

102
00:06:49,454 --> 00:06:50,875
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have a lot to say.

103
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:54,517
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to say I'm in favor of this new trash program.

104
00:06:54,537 --> 00:07:02,202
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen, personally, composting has decreased my family's need for weekly trash pickup.

105
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:11,351
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a dog and we have a container that does lock and it stays outside.

106
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:22,843
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've never seen any rats around my compost or in my trash area or in my dog's poop bag area.

107
00:07:24,163 --> 00:07:27,866
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I just really love the idea of how this is the mission behind it.

108
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:28,327
[SPEAKER_12]: I like that.

109
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:30,028
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to save our city money.

110
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:38,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and, um, I feel like it's just the future of our country, what we should all be doing, um, to adapt.

111
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:41,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and I think that's it.

112
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:42,399
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for all your work.

113
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:43,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

114
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,921
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

115
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:50,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Next is Stephanie Bima, Serez.

116
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,782
[SPEAKER_14]: When I unmute you, please your name and address for the record, and you'll have two minutes.

117
00:07:57,843 --> 00:07:58,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

118
00:08:01,004 --> 00:08:02,946
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, Stephanie.

119
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:03,006
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

120
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:04,026
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm Stephanie Behme.

121
00:08:04,046 --> 00:08:05,287
[SPEAKER_18]: I live on Broadway.

122
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:15,073
[SPEAKER_18]: So Broadway is owned by Medford, but I'm actually not sure how much of this applies to my service because the road is owned by Somerville.

123
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:17,875
[SPEAKER_18]: But anyway, I think it's a great presentation.

124
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:20,797
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand it's been long in the works.

125
00:08:21,637 --> 00:08:25,918
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not an expert in this area, but of sustainability information.

126
00:08:25,998 --> 00:08:41,142
[SPEAKER_18]: And from what I understand, pay as you go and the composting availability and everything, this is directionally, as maybe was also reflected by the awards and the rankings, this is directionally where things are going.

127
00:08:41,702 --> 00:08:51,145
[SPEAKER_18]: Also based on my travels in other countries, the places where their waste management is like you experience it the best, they have pay as you go systems, like Japan, for example.

128
00:08:51,853 --> 00:08:55,374
[SPEAKER_18]: So anyway, I think it's great and I want to support it.

129
00:08:55,454 --> 00:09:04,138
[SPEAKER_18]: And my suggestion is that perhaps you could in the future touch more on the plans that the city with the rollout.

130
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:07,619
[SPEAKER_18]: Could any part of it be progressive or gradual?

131
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:14,942
[SPEAKER_18]: And as it rolls out and people adjust to it, what are the end points of feedback and possibilities for adjustment?

132
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:18,444
[SPEAKER_18]: For example, if people need loaner bins or, you know,

133
00:09:18,974 --> 00:09:20,255
[SPEAKER_18]: increases in their volumes.

134
00:09:20,335 --> 00:09:22,777
[SPEAKER_18]: So perhaps addressing some of those concerns.

135
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:23,858
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks.

136
00:09:24,618 --> 00:09:25,219
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Stephanie.

137
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:25,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Good suggestions.

138
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:27,781
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

139
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,123
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to move on to Patty Kaya.

140
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:34,126
[SPEAKER_14]: Patty Kaya, when I unmute you, could you please list your name and address?

141
00:09:34,186 --> 00:09:34,986
[SPEAKER_14]: And you'll have two minutes.

142
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:35,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

143
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,550
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome, Patty.

144
00:09:40,217 --> 00:10:02,544
[SPEAKER_26]: by patty k a monument street and i only have one question though i do have a couple of comments the question is how do we stop this how do we stop this train before it leaves the station um i disagree with the reducing the cadence of garbage pickup for all the same reasons that many people have have said on this call social media have said on the fourteen hundred

145
00:10:03,331 --> 00:10:11,378
[SPEAKER_26]: signatory petition against this reduction in such an essential public service for all environmental concerns that we're trying to address.

146
00:10:12,138 --> 00:10:16,502
[SPEAKER_26]: My problem is that this should be the absolute last resort.

147
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:23,347
[SPEAKER_26]: Taking away weekly trash pickup should be the last thing you do, not the first thing you do.

148
00:10:23,848 --> 00:10:32,295
[SPEAKER_26]: And there are people on this call that have come up with solutions that would reduce the waste product that we're talking about

149
00:10:33,558 --> 00:10:38,664
[SPEAKER_26]: before we would cut people's essential service for all of the health and safety concerns out.

150
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:40,906
[SPEAKER_26]: So we didn't vote on this.

151
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:42,388
[SPEAKER_26]: We didn't have any input.

152
00:10:42,928 --> 00:10:46,853
[SPEAKER_26]: And my last comment is about the way that outreach has been handled by the city.

153
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:59,146
[SPEAKER_26]: It's almost like you think you can educate us into submission, as if we're all too ignorant to understand the environmental context of the problem, the greater problem.

154
00:10:59,747 --> 00:11:05,471
[SPEAKER_26]: We think it's the wrong solution to the problem, so you can keep trying to educate us.

155
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:08,273
[SPEAKER_26]: We're not too dumb to understand.

156
00:11:08,773 --> 00:11:10,555
[SPEAKER_26]: We think it's the wrong solution.

157
00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:13,497
[SPEAKER_26]: We don't ignore the fact that there's a problem.

158
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:18,674
[SPEAKER_26]: And we're asking you to rise above and try something else first.

159
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:20,575
[SPEAKER_26]: Try other things first.

160
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:22,196
[SPEAKER_26]: That's the problem.

161
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:25,918
[SPEAKER_26]: The survey was incredibly leading questions.

162
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:30,641
[SPEAKER_26]: This educational event tonight isn't about listening.

163
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:34,383
[SPEAKER_26]: It's about telling us that we're too dumb to understand why you're doing it.

164
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:36,824
[SPEAKER_26]: I would like some more respect from the city.

165
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,765
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

166
00:11:41,255 --> 00:11:41,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Patty.

167
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:44,398
[SPEAKER_14]: I know I respect every single one of you.

168
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:46,020
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's that.

169
00:11:46,701 --> 00:11:46,941
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

170
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:47,381
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

171
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:49,403
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to move on to Jen.

172
00:11:49,423 --> 00:11:50,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Jen, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

173
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:57,592
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, as a reminder to everybody, I'm trying to do this out of the utmost respect for all of you.

174
00:11:58,192 --> 00:12:01,816
[SPEAKER_14]: So Jen, if you could list your name and address, and you'll have two minutes.

175
00:12:02,036 --> 00:12:02,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

176
00:12:06,438 --> 00:12:08,319
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, Jen Segotsky, Placedead Road.

177
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:10,881
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just going to piggyback on what Patty was saying.

178
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:25,348
[SPEAKER_25]: I feel like the city has been pushing toward having a half of the pickup that we have right now, but they're not addressing the fact that there are not currently that many options for reducing the amount of trash that we have.

179
00:12:25,388 --> 00:12:33,713
[SPEAKER_25]: There are certain things like soft plastics and Styrofoam in particular that are very hard to recycle or get rid of other than in the trash.

180
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:46,538
[SPEAKER_25]: I think before we implement something like this, the city needs to have a harder push toward finding ways to recycle soft plastics, to recycling styrofoam, so that we can have the room in our bins, that it could be a lesser pickup.

181
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:52,301
[SPEAKER_25]: But right now, we live in a society where there's a lot of soft packaging, there's a lot of styrofoam.

182
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:56,643
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, if I get a piece of furniture delivered, it fills up my entire bin for the week.

183
00:12:56,903 --> 00:12:58,343
[SPEAKER_25]: There's nothing I can do about that.

184
00:12:58,483 --> 00:12:59,304
[SPEAKER_25]: There's no place.

185
00:13:00,985 --> 00:13:04,228
[SPEAKER_25]: My other concern is how do we avoid illegal dumping?

186
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:17,201
[SPEAKER_25]: As we saw with the mattresses, when the city started implementing having to pay to have mattresses picked up, I've had to call the city more than once for mattresses that have been dumped in random places, like my kids' school, for example.

187
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:23,147
[SPEAKER_25]: How is that not going to happen with trash going forward when people don't have room in their bins?

188
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:29,111
[SPEAKER_25]: And the third thing is, I'm not sure why the city is not pushing for other solutions.

189
00:13:29,171 --> 00:13:41,279
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, for example, we have this great online community called Everything is Free Medford, where people can post things and have other people pick them up, which keeps thousands and thousands of pounds of things out of the trash.

190
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:47,743
[SPEAKER_25]: Why the city is not pushing that more as an option for posting things to keep things out of the waste stream is just beyond me.

191
00:13:47,763 --> 00:13:50,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Jen.

192
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:50,825
[SPEAKER_14]: That was good feedback.

193
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:54,329
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to move on to Charlotte Cahill.

194
00:13:56,451 --> 00:14:01,476
[SPEAKER_14]: Charlotte Cahill, I'll ask you to please report your name and address, and you'll have two minutes.

195
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:05,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thanks.

196
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:07,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Charlotte Cahill.

197
00:14:07,777 --> 00:14:15,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate you creating this forum tonight and giving us an opportunity to provide some feedback.

198
00:14:15,703 --> 00:14:24,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to start by just sort of echoing some of the public health and sanitation concerns that other people have shared.

199
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,972
[SPEAKER_06]: regarding the shift to weekly or bi-weekly pickup.

200
00:14:29,532 --> 00:14:47,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to repeat everything that others have said on this, but would just add that I think one thing that's getting lodging around this is that the city's goal for composting is to have 19,000 households composting.

201
00:14:47,356 --> 00:14:54,838
[SPEAKER_06]: If that goal is achieved, that's three quarters of households in the city, meaning that one in four households will still have food waste,

202
00:14:55,658 --> 00:15:09,882
[SPEAKER_06]: their trash and federal guidelines recommend weekly pickup of all food waste precisely for the kinds of public health reasons that folks here have been raising.

203
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:18,165
[SPEAKER_06]: So just want to really kind of like emphasize that point and I think the other thing that folks haven't, some people have talked some about like

204
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:20,566
[SPEAKER_06]: cuts to an essential service.

205
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:28,089
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I want to call out really directly is that this is like creating an equity issue when you're cutting an essential public service.

206
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:46,017
[SPEAKER_06]: What this cut is doing is reframing a public health and sanitation service that should be civil government and turning that into a conversation about the consumption choices that individual people are making.

207
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:53,359
[SPEAKER_06]: That's happening without any real meaningful effort that I can see to provide alternatives.

208
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,500
[SPEAKER_06]: So this isn't just about education.

209
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:02,022
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not about telling us that we're going to have access to the same recycling and compost programs that we have now.

210
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:03,923
[SPEAKER_06]: But what else can be done here?

211
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:05,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Charlotte.

212
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:09,945
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to correct some information that you're putting out there, the compost service will go universal.

213
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:14,567
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's everybody who has eligible trash service now gets coal.

214
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:14,967
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

215
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:18,590
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we're going to move to Catherine.

216
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:20,952
[SPEAKER_21]: Tim, can we just make that a little bit clearer?

217
00:16:20,972 --> 00:16:21,972
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

218
00:16:21,992 --> 00:16:24,114
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I've seen that out on the web before.

219
00:16:24,134 --> 00:16:34,160
[SPEAKER_21]: When we say our goal is 19,000 households composting, 19,000 households is 100% of the households on the city's waste trash system.

220
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:43,706
[SPEAKER_21]: The total number of households in the city that is a higher number, those people are on commercial composting programs that are not run by the city.

221
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:45,107
[SPEAKER_21]: So our goal is composting.

222
00:16:46,892 --> 00:16:49,133
[SPEAKER_21]: 100% of the eligible households composting.

223
00:16:50,034 --> 00:16:50,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

224
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:50,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Alicia.

225
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,036
[SPEAKER_14]: Now we'll move to Catherine.

226
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:55,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Catherine, I'll ask you to unmute.

227
00:16:55,677 --> 00:16:57,999
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could report your name and address, you'll have two minutes.

228
00:16:58,219 --> 00:16:58,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

229
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:05,363
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

230
00:17:05,884 --> 00:17:06,124
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

231
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:07,844
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, thank you.

232
00:17:08,225 --> 00:17:09,665
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I missed it the first time.

233
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:11,586
[SPEAKER_15]: Catherine Bradshaw Street, Medford.

234
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:13,487
[SPEAKER_15]: Lived here all my life.

235
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:19,810
[SPEAKER_15]: So the couple of people ahead of me did touch upon what was on

236
00:17:21,682 --> 00:17:24,265
[SPEAKER_15]: of the list of things that I did want to mention.

237
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:40,019
[SPEAKER_15]: I do want to ask though, I didn't see how we're going to, the city's going to make out with paying less money to go to the burning in Saugus versus

238
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:52,805
[SPEAKER_15]: The difference that we make in garbage to God and that was one thing I felt unless I missed it during the presentation.

239
00:17:53,858 --> 00:17:59,601
[SPEAKER_15]: I did want to bring up the illegal dumping, though.

240
00:18:00,202 --> 00:18:03,744
[SPEAKER_15]: So I travel down commercial to Riverside a lot.

241
00:18:04,004 --> 00:18:11,408
[SPEAKER_15]: And before those apartments that are going to go up where CKS is, there's a lot of illegal dumping.

242
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:12,769
[SPEAKER_15]: It's dark over there.

243
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:15,070
[SPEAKER_15]: There's disfurniture.

244
00:18:15,371 --> 00:18:18,933
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think we're going to see a lot more of that.

245
00:18:19,413 --> 00:18:22,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe not only there, but as other people had said,

246
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:26,580
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the mattresses being dumped when you get furniture.

247
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,042
[SPEAKER_15]: People leave it out on the street.

248
00:18:28,723 --> 00:18:34,250
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to mention, I have called four times from May to September.

249
00:18:34,751 --> 00:18:40,759
[SPEAKER_15]: People leaving furniture out, you know, you're supposed to pay for it, they don't want to pay for it.

250
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:44,314
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the city is saying to me, where is it?

251
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Why is it there?

252
00:18:45,754 --> 00:18:50,256
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, well, if you live there, like if someone dumps in front of your house, it's your responsibility.

253
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I didn't put it there.

254
00:18:51,616 --> 00:18:53,437
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I think that may be happening.

255
00:18:53,917 --> 00:19:01,639
[SPEAKER_15]: And then maybe not to mention, possibly the fistfights that will be happening when people are using other people's trash barrels.

256
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,940
[SPEAKER_15]: I think those are things I just wanted to put out there.

257
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,801
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank you very much for listening.

258
00:19:07,821 --> 00:19:09,201
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Catherine.

259
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:10,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate it.

260
00:19:11,462 --> 00:19:13,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Nicholas Girlio.

261
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:15,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Nicholas, I'll ask you to unmute.

262
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:17,884
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could report your name and address, you'll have two minutes.

263
00:19:18,164 --> 00:19:18,464
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

264
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:22,806
[SPEAKER_14]: Real quick, may not have got you.

265
00:19:23,946 --> 00:19:24,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully I did.

266
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:25,286
[SPEAKER_14]: If not, I'll do it again.

267
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,428
[SPEAKER_21]: You may have hit the one next to him.

268
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:31,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yes, I hit Fred.

269
00:19:31,188 --> 00:19:32,749
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to unmute you again.

270
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:34,069
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you already did it himself.

271
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:34,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Fred.

272
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:36,430
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm going to try Nicholas one more time.

273
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:40,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome, Niklas.

274
00:20:02,087 --> 00:20:06,250
[SPEAKER_13]: Only about 20% of people could actually commit to a yes response.

275
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:13,455
[SPEAKER_13]: Now you compare this to the survey that was recently released, which doesn't ask do people want this service change, right?

276
00:20:13,535 --> 00:20:18,018
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's full of loaded questions and really, really unscientific in a lot of ways.

277
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:23,763
[SPEAKER_13]: So my question for the city is very simply, will the city make a decision here that reflects what the majority wants?

278
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:33,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Based on that poll, based on what people are saying here tonight, it seems that overwhelmingly, and based on what people have said leading to this, it seems overwhelmingly that people don't want this.

279
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,070
[SPEAKER_13]: So will the city listen?

280
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:37,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Will the city propose an alternative?

281
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:44,357
[SPEAKER_13]: And I fully understand and respect the financial implication, but will the city propose an alternative here that reflects what the majority wants?

282
00:20:44,757 --> 00:20:45,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

283
00:20:45,097 --> 00:20:47,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, Nick, you got a little bit of time left.

284
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,340
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to ask a clarifying question.

285
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,603
[SPEAKER_14]: Was there a specific element of the program that you were speaking about?

286
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,107
[SPEAKER_14]: the service change obviously to bi-weekly trash collection.

287
00:20:58,467 --> 00:20:59,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, you shouldn't say it.

288
00:20:59,528 --> 00:21:01,609
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a feeling that's what you're talking about.

289
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:02,630
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to make sure it was clear.

290
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

291
00:21:05,191 --> 00:21:09,914
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we're going to move on to Fred Roach from Mute.

292
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:13,496
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could say your name and address, you'll have two minutes to speak.

293
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:14,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

294
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:19,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, hi.

295
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,881
[SPEAKER_00]: 77 Whittier Road in Medford.

296
00:21:22,162 --> 00:21:26,326
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to go out there and say that I'm totally opposed to this.

297
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:27,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Big surprise.

298
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:31,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, I spoke to two landlords today at a social event.

299
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:33,674
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't live in the city.

300
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:38,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither landlord knew anything about a trash change.

301
00:21:40,441 --> 00:21:43,284
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what kind of notifications gone out, if any.

302
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:50,262
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this decision has already been made, and this has been in the residents' throats.

303
00:21:50,682 --> 00:21:58,784
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've lived in the city for 65 years, and in 65 years, this is going to be the worst decision I've had from the city of Medford.

304
00:21:59,644 --> 00:22:06,026
[SPEAKER_00]: And second of all, I have scrap plans to build an ADU because of this.

305
00:22:06,686 --> 00:22:11,667
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if your millions of dollars in savings is going to calculate what you're going to lose.

306
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:14,671
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's my thoughts on it.

307
00:22:14,971 --> 00:22:16,053
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't waste my time.

308
00:22:17,114 --> 00:22:18,936
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be wasting my time.

309
00:22:19,677 --> 00:22:20,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Fred.

310
00:22:21,018 --> 00:22:22,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Just same question I had for Nicholas.

311
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:28,887
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe you were specifying the part of the program where it goes to every other week as opposed to like universal compost or other aspects of the program.

312
00:22:30,911 --> 00:22:31,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

313
00:22:31,832 --> 00:22:33,374
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to clarify.

314
00:22:33,794 --> 00:22:37,137
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some time remaining, so let me comment.

315
00:22:37,478 --> 00:22:43,023
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been no soliciting of the citizens with regard to how they feel.

316
00:22:43,223 --> 00:22:46,206
[SPEAKER_00]: And if whatever's been done, it's been disregarded.

317
00:22:46,306 --> 00:22:49,669
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really a decision is going to come back and haunt the city.

318
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:50,950
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.

319
00:22:52,752 --> 00:22:53,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

320
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:54,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good night.

321
00:22:55,434 --> 00:22:55,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Fred.

322
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:01,654
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to move to Sarah Berndt.

323
00:23:03,196 --> 00:23:04,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry if I'm mispronouncing that.

324
00:23:04,737 --> 00:23:05,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Sarah Berndt.

325
00:23:05,238 --> 00:23:06,620
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to ask you to unmute.

326
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,460
[SPEAKER_14]: You have your name and address.

327
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,201
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll have two minutes.

328
00:23:08,562 --> 00:23:08,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

329
00:23:14,408 --> 00:23:14,628
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello?

330
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:16,010
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello.

331
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:17,712
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you hear me?

332
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:18,513
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, there we go.

333
00:23:19,444 --> 00:23:20,145
[SPEAKER_22]: Welcome.

334
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,486
[SPEAKER_19]: Sarah, nice to see you all.

335
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,347
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you all for being here.

336
00:23:23,607 --> 00:23:24,808
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I live on Sharon street.

337
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:30,993
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, and what others say are saying, you know, waste costs are up because plastic waste is a problem globally.

338
00:23:31,173 --> 00:23:36,537
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, you know, we're, I don't think we are going to only compost our way out of this one.

339
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:39,420
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's going to take, um, a more holistic approach.

340
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,562
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, our family already composts everything that we can.

341
00:23:42,602 --> 00:23:44,644
[SPEAKER_19]: We try to reduce waste as much as possible.

342
00:23:45,415 --> 00:23:50,076
[SPEAKER_19]: We visit the local plastic-free refillery on Boston Ave, Trove Green Preservations.

343
00:23:50,136 --> 00:23:55,418
[SPEAKER_19]: If you haven't heard of it, it's a great way to cut down on some of that packaging for your household goods.

344
00:23:56,398 --> 00:23:59,339
[SPEAKER_19]: But like others have said, I'm also worried about trash sitting.

345
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:09,942
[SPEAKER_19]: We're pretty rat-free here in West Medford so far, knock on wood, but we really, really don't want any from Somerville over here across the river.

346
00:24:11,142 --> 00:24:18,008
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, dog waste, diapers, like people have said, the food waste, meat, all of those are going to be really, really smelly.

347
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,971
[SPEAKER_19]: I think, you know, the program in

348
00:24:22,805 --> 00:24:29,289
[SPEAKER_19]: And its intent is really great, but adoption is going to happen when we make things easier for people, not harder.

349
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:37,574
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we should be thinking of this more holistically, like can we increase soft plastic cycling to keep that part out of the trash?

350
00:24:37,995 --> 00:24:43,038
[SPEAKER_19]: Can we provide free compost bags for families to drive them towards the composting program?

351
00:24:43,898 --> 00:24:50,803
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we could just have options instead of feeling like we're punishing residents for having trash,

352
00:24:51,243 --> 00:24:56,366
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe we try to think about this as a explore other areas for reducing trash overall.

353
00:24:57,347 --> 00:24:57,687
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

354
00:24:58,748 --> 00:24:59,408
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Sarah.

355
00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:00,969
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate your comments.

356
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

357
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Shayna, over here to get the name here.

358
00:25:07,993 --> 00:25:13,036
[SPEAKER_14]: Shayna Simenstein, if you could please address, you'll have two minutes.

359
00:25:14,918 --> 00:25:15,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome Shayna.

360
00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:32,177
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, I am on Hume Ave in Hillside and I just wanted to thank everybody in the city for trying to address the really challenging problem of waste management because

361
00:25:33,451 --> 00:25:45,043
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, the cost of waste disposal is increasing, and, like, we are running out of places to put trash, and I think this is a, and so, like, I'm in full support of trying to find creative solutions to deal with this.

362
00:25:45,964 --> 00:25:54,232
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, and, um, I guess I had just a couple of questions, I think, to reiterate a few other folks who have

363
00:25:54,572 --> 00:25:57,554
[SPEAKER_20]: like are in support of this, but also have some questions.

364
00:25:59,115 --> 00:26:08,922
[SPEAKER_20]: And one is, what is the city going to do about all of the residential buildings that don't qualify for this because they have more than four or six units?

365
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:09,402
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't remember.

366
00:26:10,262 --> 00:26:15,446
[SPEAKER_20]: Especially when the 2030 ban on food waste takes effect from the state.

367
00:26:17,498 --> 00:26:32,349
[SPEAKER_20]: And then my other question is, yeah, like, what is the city doing to kind of like holistically address this issue in addition to, like, trying to cut down on the waste stream through trash pickup, but...

368
00:26:34,397 --> 00:26:44,767
[SPEAKER_20]: Like through reducing plastic at the grocery store or takeout containers etc just to like help residents achieve the goal of having like half as much trash as they currently do.

369
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:52,535
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I think like what I'm hearing is a lot of the concern about this is like fear of not being able to fit everything in your bin.

370
00:26:52,595 --> 00:26:53,216
[SPEAKER_20]: So I feel like

371
00:26:55,533 --> 00:27:04,378
[SPEAKER_20]: Having the city work on tangential issues that could help reduce waste would be really helpful, especially in the next 18 month lead up to this rollout.

372
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:07,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Shana.

373
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate the comments.

374
00:27:09,721 --> 00:27:11,302
[SPEAKER_14]: And it looks like we have Alessandra back.

375
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:13,804
[SPEAKER_14]: Alessandra's iPhone is next.

376
00:27:14,624 --> 00:27:15,765
[SPEAKER_14]: So go ahead and unmute you.

377
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:17,706
[SPEAKER_14]: If you can let us know your name and address, you'll have 2 minutes.

378
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:28,170
[SPEAKER_22]: Alessandra Cameron.

379
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:36,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Alessandra's iPhone, you hear?

380
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:41,259
[SPEAKER_21]: She told our troubleshooting staff that she was having trouble clicking the unmute button.

381
00:27:44,601 --> 00:27:55,629
[SPEAKER_21]: Alessandra, if you want to message your comment to our troubleshooting staff, get it out for you, or you could email it to waste at medford-ma.gov that you see on the screen there.

382
00:27:55,749 --> 00:27:56,590
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm really sorry that

383
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,266
[SPEAKER_21]: you're having technical trouble.

384
00:27:59,567 --> 00:28:00,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, sorry about that.

385
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:03,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's try it one more time for good measure.

386
00:28:05,794 --> 00:28:06,434
[SPEAKER_14]: That doesn't work.

387
00:28:07,836 --> 00:28:08,857
[SPEAKER_14]: Move to Jim Bennett.

388
00:28:10,178 --> 00:28:11,619
[SPEAKER_14]: So Jim Bennett, get ready.

389
00:28:14,022 --> 00:28:18,386
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, Jim Bennett, I'm going to go ahead and ask you to unmute.

390
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:19,587
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could guess, you'll have two minutes.

391
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:20,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

392
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:23,860
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, there we go.

393
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,341
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

394
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:36,627
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I have a lot of the conservative this every two week pickup, but some of my I think the intent is good about reducing trash, doing more recycling, but I find our program is not.

395
00:28:37,087 --> 00:28:39,268
[SPEAKER_31]: We do the standard recycling for the state.

396
00:28:39,348 --> 00:28:45,712
[SPEAKER_31]: I understand that, but there are a lot of the programs and styrofoam is not very recyclable, but there are places will accept it in there.

397
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:59,454
[SPEAKER_31]: Not in their curbside, but they have, um, but that fact, the recycling compost we have on there every, at least every two weeks, uh, getting rid of cardboard because yeah, you cycle bin, but try fitting everything in there with cardboard.

398
00:28:59,474 --> 00:29:00,075
[SPEAKER_31]: It doesn't work.

399
00:29:02,295 --> 00:29:10,841
[SPEAKER_31]: And when you go to the compactor, you'll find a lot of people have stuff that shouldn't be in there, hard plastics, baskets, styrofoam.

400
00:29:10,861 --> 00:29:16,165
[SPEAKER_31]: And recently I saw someone say that they don't flatten their, their cardboard.

401
00:29:16,205 --> 00:29:17,286
[SPEAKER_31]: So that, that's an issue.

402
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:21,186
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think that's great that it's there.

403
00:29:21,206 --> 00:29:27,332
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, years ago, I remember bringing bottles down and breaking them down at the city yard, probably in the 80s.

404
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:36,500
[SPEAKER_31]: But what I kind of, my other question too is, in the contract, my understanding is the contract was signed two years ago, but that's not correct.

405
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:37,641
[SPEAKER_31]: Correct me?

406
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:42,314
[SPEAKER_31]: And in the consideration of the contract, do we look at different vendors?

407
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:44,555
[SPEAKER_31]: Do we look at dual stream?

408
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:49,459
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, right now we dump all this paper in there with all the other stuff.

409
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:53,803
[SPEAKER_31]: It's not, it's a contaminated, more contaminated than a dual stream.

410
00:29:53,903 --> 00:29:57,726
[SPEAKER_31]: And then there's a multi stream, which is, did we look into dual stream?

411
00:29:57,746 --> 00:29:59,667
[SPEAKER_31]: Cause I know that's available in this area.

412
00:29:59,987 --> 00:30:01,709
[SPEAKER_31]: I looked up a chart on the DEP.

413
00:30:02,738 --> 00:30:20,747
[SPEAKER_31]: nasty ep and i don't know if that was because you get a better product where you divide in your bottles your cans and your plastic um so i don't know if that was considered or not that would be bonus it seemed to be it would be better recycling uh cleaner non-contaminated thank you thank you um

414
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:27,204
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we did go through a lengthy RFP process just to make sure folks understand that.

415
00:30:27,304 --> 00:30:28,684
[SPEAKER_14]: So, lots of things were considered.

416
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:33,446
[SPEAKER_14]: So, the RFP process was comprehensive and lengthy.

417
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,247
[SPEAKER_14]: So, any of that information?

418
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:38,548
[SPEAKER_31]: It was comprehensive, but did it consider other streams, or?

419
00:30:39,228 --> 00:30:40,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, comprehensive, that's what that means.

420
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,629
[SPEAKER_14]: So, all options were considered, yeah.

421
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:46,211
[SPEAKER_31]: All right, because single stream, I was never for single stream.

422
00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:52,133
[SPEAKER_31]: I remember when we did paper, and we did our bottles and our cans and separate bins, and I was very happy with that.

423
00:30:52,773 --> 00:30:53,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Jim.

424
00:30:53,494 --> 00:30:55,616
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we're going to move on to Ted Blake.

425
00:30:57,017 --> 00:31:00,560
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Ted, I'm going to ask you to unmute if you could let us know your name and address.

426
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,681
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll have two minutes to speak.

427
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:02,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

428
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Ted Blake, Toro Ave.

429
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:22,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to skip some of the things that other people have said, concerns, dumping was one of the ones, concerns about single stream plastics, like, you know, making sure this is addressed, not just on the citizens, but you know, the residents, but on the grocery stores and things like that.

430
00:31:22,976 --> 00:31:26,117
[SPEAKER_05]: The two other things that I just wanted to chime in that haven't been mentioned.

431
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:34,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, kind of going along with dumping is just the idea of like, I anticipate, I don't know, people just like filling up the bins at the parks and things like that.

432
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:38,760
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm just wondering if that's taken into account, just like if that there's going to be increased volume there.

433
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:46,542
[SPEAKER_05]: And the second one was if there's any potential solution for having a transfer station that's open to residents.

434
00:31:46,602 --> 00:31:53,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I know other towns have transfer stations you can bring things to or instead of the pay-as-you-go bags.

435
00:31:54,084 --> 00:31:54,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

436
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:56,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

437
00:31:56,193 --> 00:32:03,579
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to make sure folks know, a transfer station requires land and a whole different set of permitting, so we don't have one.

438
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:04,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, thank you.

439
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:08,043
[SPEAKER_14]: We're gonna move on to Christian's iPhone.

440
00:32:08,564 --> 00:32:12,427
[SPEAKER_14]: iPhone, when I unmute you, if you could list your name and address, and you'll have two minutes, thank you.

441
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:19,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Christian.

442
00:32:20,213 --> 00:32:20,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I say Christian?

443
00:32:20,894 --> 00:32:21,995
[SPEAKER_14]: I meant Christine, sorry.

444
00:32:22,617 --> 00:32:23,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

445
00:32:23,097 --> 00:32:25,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I was got a little confused by that.

446
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:26,679
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know why.

447
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:28,100
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, you know, I'm just starting to cross.

448
00:32:30,361 --> 00:32:37,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, one, you know, a couple of the things I wanted to go over was, uh, using this single stream recycling.

449
00:32:37,885 --> 00:32:42,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking like how much money we could probably get just on paper and cardboard alone.

450
00:32:43,788 --> 00:32:51,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, a lot of cities and towns use that, but by using a single, we're wasting just the paper, you know, the chance of getting paper.

451
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:52,879
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry?

452
00:32:52,899 --> 00:32:56,082
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that was a rogue microphone.

453
00:32:56,522 --> 00:33:03,630
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to know, like, we're using single stream, we could be getting money back on paper and cardboard and all that.

454
00:33:04,431 --> 00:33:07,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to know, the city is paying for the concurrent composting.

455
00:33:07,835 --> 00:33:11,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that we received a grant, but what will the future cost be?

456
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to get that question out.

457
00:33:15,131 --> 00:33:21,596
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, Mr. McGiven, I know that you've questioned a couple of people saying, you know, what was it that they were talking about?

458
00:33:21,856 --> 00:33:23,056
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it in regards to?

459
00:33:23,737 --> 00:33:31,962
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the actual advertisement for this particular Zoom said, if you wanted, we wanted to hear about our upcoming changes to our waste collection system.

460
00:33:32,342 --> 00:33:37,806
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would assume that it would always be regarding the once every two week pickup.

461
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:39,811
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I asked.

462
00:33:39,832 --> 00:33:43,174
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to be sure because we also have universal comprosses part of this program.

463
00:33:43,474 --> 00:33:45,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but that's not that people have.

464
00:33:45,415 --> 00:33:53,441
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the major concern is that you're asking people to pick up once every other week and that would be, you know, that that's the part that would impact most people.

465
00:33:53,461 --> 00:33:56,683
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's exactly why I'm asking folks to clarify to make sure that that goes on record.

466
00:33:56,723 --> 00:33:57,543
[SPEAKER_14]: If that's the concern.

467
00:33:58,744 --> 00:33:58,904
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

468
00:33:58,964 --> 00:33:59,945
[SPEAKER_14]: That's exactly why I'm asking.

469
00:33:59,985 --> 00:34:00,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, ma'am.

470
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,307
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

471
00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:03,848
[SPEAKER_14]: On to Ralph Klein.

472
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,569
[SPEAKER_14]: So Ralph Klein, if, uh,

473
00:34:06,013 --> 00:34:10,817
[SPEAKER_14]: You could give us your name and address, and you'll have two minutes when I ask you to unmute.

474
00:34:10,837 --> 00:34:21,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear me?

475
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:22,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Ralph.

476
00:34:22,246 --> 00:34:22,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, welcome.

477
00:34:23,707 --> 00:34:24,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.

478
00:34:24,548 --> 00:34:26,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, my concern is with this every other week.

479
00:34:28,111 --> 00:34:31,073
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's absolutely ridiculous for a reason.

480
00:34:31,754 --> 00:34:33,115
[SPEAKER_09]: For a bin that's

481
00:34:34,664 --> 00:34:35,645
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, composting bin.

482
00:34:35,685 --> 00:34:38,006
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one 10th the size of the regular barrel.

483
00:34:38,427 --> 00:34:41,689
[SPEAKER_09]: You think people are going to reduce their trash by half per week?

484
00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:43,970
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a little unrealistic.

485
00:34:44,731 --> 00:34:48,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember the composting we did back in the sixties.

486
00:34:49,134 --> 00:34:51,235
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a bin thing bucket in your backyard.

487
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,437
[SPEAKER_09]: I gave pictures to the city council of the bin.

488
00:34:54,457 --> 00:34:55,058
[SPEAKER_09]: You take it out.

489
00:34:55,438 --> 00:34:58,340
[SPEAKER_09]: The swill wagon would go down the street and would stink the street up.

490
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you have all this money.

491
00:35:00,902 --> 00:35:02,723
[SPEAKER_09]: You think every week it's supposed to be.

492
00:35:03,354 --> 00:35:05,897
[SPEAKER_09]: from my understanding, but trashes every other week?

493
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:13,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is this one-tenth size bin and cuts the trash in half?

494
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:15,186
[SPEAKER_09]: That's totally unrealistic.

495
00:35:15,887 --> 00:35:17,108
[SPEAKER_09]: The second problem is rats.

496
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Wherever you have construction, you have rats.

497
00:35:20,471 --> 00:35:23,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Route 93, when they redid the rotary, the rats went over to the church.

498
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:25,643
[SPEAKER_09]: and all that neighborhood.

499
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:31,726
[SPEAKER_09]: On Salem Street, when they did the sink building, they're now doing the building on the corner of Park Street.

500
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:33,367
[SPEAKER_09]: They're talking about doing another one down the street.

501
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,188
[SPEAKER_09]: That's gonna bring rats into the neighborhood.

502
00:35:35,228 --> 00:35:36,709
[SPEAKER_09]: People say, oh no, it doesn't.

503
00:35:37,649 --> 00:35:38,810
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have a rat problem.

504
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:39,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we do.

505
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,372
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen more rats around here than I have in years.

506
00:35:43,572 --> 00:35:44,513
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's crazy.

507
00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:46,814
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're saying, oh, well, we can strip.

508
00:35:47,174 --> 00:35:50,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, why not make a third collection bin?

509
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:54,390
[SPEAKER_09]: for trash, for the plastic recyclables, for the styrofoam.

510
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:57,132
[SPEAKER_09]: That way there, or give us a drop-off spot for it.

511
00:35:57,152 --> 00:35:58,512
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a dumpster for cardboard.

512
00:35:59,353 --> 00:36:01,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't you put another dumpster full of trash?

513
00:36:02,555 --> 00:36:05,636
[SPEAKER_09]: And overflow styrofoam or the plastics to be recycled.

514
00:36:06,857 --> 00:36:08,177
[SPEAKER_09]: It eliminates part of your problem.

515
00:36:08,337 --> 00:36:09,818
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, sit in this instinct.

516
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:11,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's wonderful.

517
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:11,959
[SPEAKER_09]: It's small.

518
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:13,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody has a garbage disposal.

519
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,342
[SPEAKER_09]: For the amount you're gonna put in it, it's ridiculous to say, oh, every other week.

520
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:19,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

521
00:36:20,669 --> 00:36:21,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Ralph.

522
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate the comments.

523
00:36:23,332 --> 00:36:25,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, we're going to move on to Gianna Salvalletti.

524
00:36:27,537 --> 00:36:31,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Gianna, when I ask you to unmute, if you could give us your name and address, you'll have two minutes.

525
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:38,710
[SPEAKER_27]: Hello, I'm Chiana Salveletti, Tamar Drive.

526
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:42,351
[SPEAKER_27]: I turned to plus plus most of the concerns others have raised tonight.

527
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:47,432
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm very concerned about the impact this will have on public health and the rodent situation in the city.

528
00:36:47,452 --> 00:36:50,273
[SPEAKER_27]: I have a dog and last summer has been by mistake.

529
00:36:50,733 --> 00:36:53,314
[SPEAKER_27]: And so we had to wait for the next week for it to be picked up.

530
00:36:53,434 --> 00:36:55,975
[SPEAKER_27]: And in the summer heat, I ended up getting maggots in my bin.

531
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,856
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'm super concerned that this would become the norm with this plan.

532
00:36:59,496 --> 00:37:06,945
[SPEAKER_27]: And after today's presentation, it sounds like a good area for improvement for our current trash strategy is resolving the contaminated recycling.

533
00:37:07,185 --> 00:37:14,114
[SPEAKER_27]: At this point, if folks aren't recycling correctly, I don't have much hope that they'll be able to handle bi-weekly trash responsibly.

534
00:37:14,634 --> 00:37:21,236
[SPEAKER_27]: But I think that would be a good place to say we should create milestones that we must achieve before implementing something this drastic.

535
00:37:21,776 --> 00:37:31,819
[SPEAKER_27]: And lastly, I feel like it wasn't previously communicated properly that the Massachusetts Food Waste Ban was just a proposal, and that's how it was presented today.

536
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:38,901
[SPEAKER_27]: And by drastically changing our trash schedule this early on, I feel like we're being overly proactive for something that's just in the proposal phase.

537
00:37:39,461 --> 00:37:48,047
[SPEAKER_27]: I think there are much easier milestones we could achieve as a city to positively impact the environment without posing such a significant risk this early on to our city.

538
00:37:48,447 --> 00:37:48,807
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

539
00:37:48,827 --> 00:37:51,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Jenna.

540
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:52,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Comments are appreciated.

541
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:56,492
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, the next person is just named iPhone.

542
00:37:57,313 --> 00:38:00,395
[SPEAKER_14]: So, if you're just named iPhone, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

543
00:38:00,755 --> 00:38:03,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Please let us know your name and address and you will have 2 minutes.

544
00:38:08,388 --> 00:38:08,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

545
00:38:08,929 --> 00:38:09,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

546
00:38:11,691 --> 00:38:12,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm calling from my mom.

547
00:38:12,852 --> 00:38:14,294
[SPEAKER_04]: She lives on my mystery.

548
00:38:14,394 --> 00:38:33,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I also live in Medford as well I'm calling because so it's Monument Street Yes, and I live in Medford as well There's an equity issue regarding seniors who live in their homes who have incontinence issues and

549
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,456
[SPEAKER_04]: And my mom has lived in this city over 60-something years.

550
00:38:38,637 --> 00:38:39,818
[SPEAKER_04]: She's over 100 years old.

551
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:41,621
[SPEAKER_04]: She does not get out.

552
00:38:43,063 --> 00:38:50,354
[SPEAKER_04]: She doesn't make food waste and we use a garbage disposal, but her trash bin is filled every single week.

553
00:38:51,225 --> 00:38:58,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, and she says the, we have two trash barrels that she says with her tenant, um, and they fill it every week.

554
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:03,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we're getting boxes almost, you know, every week for the stuff that she has to use.

555
00:39:04,336 --> 00:39:05,437
[SPEAKER_04]: We flatten the boxes.

556
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:08,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Her recycle container is filled every other week.

557
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know, because I think this is a done deal.

558
00:39:11,522 --> 00:39:13,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Will there be a discount for seniors?

559
00:39:13,964 --> 00:39:19,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, um, you know, you talk about the pay to throw some seniors cannot afford.

560
00:39:21,379 --> 00:39:39,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think, I hope you can still hear me, I lost my part, but some seniors cannot afford, and I think we just all just use the pay to throw, just you don't know the extra cost that can be for a senior to take that on every single month to pay for

561
00:39:40,649 --> 00:39:45,270
[SPEAKER_04]: the bags or a bigger bin, and I saw some cost about $12 a month.

562
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I read it wrong, I don't know.

563
00:39:48,151 --> 00:39:49,712
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I said there's an equity issue.

564
00:39:50,152 --> 00:39:55,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Will there be a senior discount, some sort of, and we need to take that into consideration.

565
00:39:55,553 --> 00:40:03,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Not every senior lives in an apartment building, and also Method does not do a good job in notifying residents about issues.

566
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:08,577
[SPEAKER_04]: We should not have had to hear this on the news, especially since it was proposed and done since,

567
00:40:09,899 --> 00:40:10,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

568
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:15,843
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, there's a written comment from Alessandra.

569
00:40:15,863 --> 00:40:19,626
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to read that was the person that on so she submitted a written comment.

570
00:40:19,646 --> 00:40:20,586
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to go ahead and read that.

571
00:40:20,946 --> 00:40:25,109
[SPEAKER_14]: And I also want to clarify that for compost, we don't pay for the tonnage.

572
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,691
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're not the tonnage.

573
00:40:27,811 --> 00:40:29,472
[SPEAKER_14]: That's important for folks to know.

574
00:40:29,492 --> 00:40:31,694
[SPEAKER_14]: So it sounds like there was a misunderstanding out there.

575
00:40:32,234 --> 00:40:32,474
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um.

576
00:40:33,693 --> 00:40:34,473
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll go ahead and read this out.

577
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:36,414
[SPEAKER_14]: This is from Alessandra.

578
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:43,936
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to know how they're going to deal with the Tufts population around here, with four and five adults per apartment throwing out trash.

579
00:40:44,657 --> 00:40:49,518
[SPEAKER_14]: I live on Yale Street in South Merritt, surrounded by two family houses rented to students.

580
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:55,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Landlords are absent, and there's no communication to them about this upcoming change in trash pickup.

581
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,902
[SPEAKER_14]: The landlord of their neighborhood, or even their own properties, in many cases.

582
00:41:00,874 --> 00:41:03,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Additionally, the communication around this was not optimal.

583
00:41:04,115 --> 00:41:06,296
[SPEAKER_14]: We are hearing about this and the decision has been made.

584
00:41:06,776 --> 00:41:09,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Why weren't residents allowed to vote on this?

585
00:41:10,158 --> 00:41:10,938
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Alessandro.

586
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:18,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, we're going to move to Natarajan, Pravitha Natarajan.

587
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:23,643
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to ask you to unmute if you could let us know your name in a few minutes.

588
00:41:23,663 --> 00:41:23,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

589
00:41:27,813 --> 00:41:28,995
[SPEAKER_29]: Hi, this is Pravita.

590
00:41:30,937 --> 00:41:32,839
[SPEAKER_29]: I live on Osborne Road.

591
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:39,327
[SPEAKER_29]: I wanted to voice my support for this plan, but I also understand the concerns from a lot of residents.

592
00:41:39,807 --> 00:41:44,032
[SPEAKER_29]: I understand change is hard, but we can do hard things for the greater good.

593
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:47,394
[SPEAKER_29]: I wanted to talk about a couple of things.

594
00:41:47,794 --> 00:41:52,937
[SPEAKER_29]: I think the cost perspective, we spoke about that, and it is going to save the city a lot of cost.

595
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:59,520
[SPEAKER_29]: But also one thing I wanted to highlight is that, unfortunately, trash is not something that is out of sight, out of mind.

596
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:05,143
[SPEAKER_29]: We spoke about Asaga's incinerator, which means they are enclosed to the incinerator.

597
00:42:06,703 --> 00:42:17,169
[SPEAKER_29]: landfill stations and everything that's getting burned is affecting their air and water quality and there is a health impact for communities that live next to the incinerators.

598
00:42:17,249 --> 00:42:21,151
[SPEAKER_29]: So by reducing our trash we are indirectly helping them as well.

599
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:31,259
[SPEAKER_29]: Another thing I wanted to suggest was that potentially the city can also, so the rat problem has been raised and it is a real issue.

600
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:49,672
[SPEAKER_29]: Composting well can prevent rats from getting into your compost, but also would the city also help residents replace kind of damaged or compromised trash cans, so that could keep rats away from their trash cans, potentially with dog poop and whatnot.

601
00:42:50,312 --> 00:43:02,034
[SPEAKER_29]: And then finally, I wanted to say that a small group of Medford residents, we have started an initiative called Zero Waste Medford to work with the residents and help them learn about ways to reduce.

602
00:43:02,154 --> 00:43:04,774
[SPEAKER_29]: Look forward to the opportunity to work with the city as well.

603
00:43:05,155 --> 00:43:05,515
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

604
00:43:07,035 --> 00:43:08,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for those offers, Praveeta.

605
00:43:10,235 --> 00:43:11,336
[SPEAKER_14]: And we appreciate it.

606
00:43:11,376 --> 00:43:14,256
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to move on to Niver, she, her.

607
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:16,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Niver, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

608
00:43:17,036 --> 00:43:19,937
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could give us your name and address, you'll have two minutes.

609
00:43:22,435 --> 00:43:24,057
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, I'm new there.

610
00:43:24,417 --> 00:43:36,670
[SPEAKER_28]: I live at I live on Hicks have and I wanted to a lot of what people said, I really appreciate the thought that has gone into this and you soliciting opinions now.

611
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,712
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think it's a really good idea for.

612
00:43:39,593 --> 00:43:41,975
[SPEAKER_28]: us to be thinking about reducing our waste stream.

613
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:45,938
[SPEAKER_28]: I have been trying to do that all my life basically.

614
00:43:45,958 --> 00:44:02,392
[SPEAKER_28]: But I am concerned particularly about the aspect of these changes for single family condo townhome owners like myself who are not going to have access to trash and recycling services anymore.

615
00:44:02,512 --> 00:44:03,173
[SPEAKER_28]: So basically

616
00:44:03,773 --> 00:44:12,921
[SPEAKER_28]: will still be paying the same taxes to subsidize everyone else's trash and recycling services and then we'll also have to pay for our own trash and recycling.

617
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:24,352
[SPEAKER_28]: And if we want to compost on top of that will then also have to pay for that and I'm just concerned that that's accessible to me and I wanted to boost some of what other people have said about

618
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,474
[SPEAKER_28]: providing other options.

619
00:44:26,534 --> 00:44:31,599
[SPEAKER_28]: I would love to have more options of things to recycle, places to recycle them.

620
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:36,363
[SPEAKER_28]: I think the reuse communities people have pointed out are a really good idea.

621
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:46,813
[SPEAKER_28]: I think there are a lot of other solutions that could make this easier for people, but it does feel like someone else said like

622
00:44:47,714 --> 00:44:49,095
[SPEAKER_28]: this was rolled out to me.

623
00:44:49,175 --> 00:45:07,082
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm a pretty new resident I just moved here this year and it feels like almost as soon as I moved here I got told like oh you're not going to get trash and recycling or compost anymore and pay for it yourself and but keep paying the same taxes and that just didn't feel right.

624
00:45:07,402 --> 00:45:07,802
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

625
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:09,723
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

626
00:45:10,563 --> 00:45:10,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

627
00:45:14,305 --> 00:45:15,205
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to move on to

628
00:45:16,538 --> 00:45:17,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Vinny or Vinay.

629
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Vinny or Vinay, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

630
00:45:20,322 --> 00:45:22,303
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could give us your name and address, you will have two minutes.

631
00:45:25,446 --> 00:45:25,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, hello.

632
00:45:26,928 --> 00:45:27,388
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, welcome.

633
00:45:27,408 --> 00:45:29,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, thank you for the opportunity.

634
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:30,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Vinay.

635
00:45:30,591 --> 00:45:32,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Osborne Road in Medford.

636
00:45:33,394 --> 00:45:35,756
[SPEAKER_02]: I am for this initiative.

637
00:45:35,896 --> 00:45:39,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the biweekly crash is the right thing to do.

638
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:40,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I cook a lot.

639
00:45:40,816 --> 00:45:47,042
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I after the composting free composting, my compost bin gets filled up more often than my trash.

640
00:45:47,763 --> 00:45:50,906
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the city is doing the right thing by getting ahead of this problem.

641
00:45:51,947 --> 00:45:54,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this is something we'll eventually need to address.

642
00:45:55,591 --> 00:45:56,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to share my opinion.

643
00:45:57,093 --> 00:45:58,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it Vinny or Vinay?

644
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:02,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, anyway, he's already muted, so you may never know.

645
00:46:03,073 --> 00:46:03,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

646
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:06,737
[SPEAKER_14]: We're gonna move on to G. G, I'm gonna ask you to unmute.

647
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:10,281
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could tell us your name and address, and you'll have two minutes.

648
00:46:14,727 --> 00:46:17,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Ben Lindvig-Lingler, live on Sunset Avenue.

649
00:46:17,588 --> 00:46:25,032
[SPEAKER_08]: I joined a little bit late, so I'm not sure if this has been asked, but I was really curious, has the proposal been a big cost savings?

650
00:46:26,032 --> 00:46:41,359
[SPEAKER_08]: I was curious if the City or what the City has been doing to explore actual increased municipal revenues to ensure that we main level of service as opposed to cutting services and passing on costs to residents as was just described, whether that's

651
00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:51,671
[SPEAKER_08]: In expanded containers to meet the 2 week requirement or like with the single family condo owners who have to put the bill themselves.

652
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:53,894
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like for a city that.

653
00:46:54,695 --> 00:46:55,896
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe we're in the bottom 10% of.

654
00:46:58,123 --> 00:47:01,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, taxes as it relates to other municipalities in the state.

655
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:03,367
[SPEAKER_08]: We should be considering increase.

656
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:06,308
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not a unrealistic thing to be planning for.

657
00:47:06,389 --> 00:47:09,891
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd really like to understand how we are increasing municipal revenue.

658
00:47:09,951 --> 00:47:12,853
[SPEAKER_08]: So we don't end up having to cut, but others as well.

659
00:47:14,155 --> 00:47:18,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, as it relates to pests, it's not just rats.

660
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Where we live near Tufts University, it's rats, it's squirrels.

661
00:47:22,602 --> 00:47:24,463
[SPEAKER_08]: They get into the existing trash bins.

662
00:47:24,503 --> 00:47:31,968
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had to replace the lid on our trash containers twice in the last year due to squirrels and rats.

663
00:47:32,669 --> 00:47:35,811
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that that's only going to be increasing as well.

664
00:47:35,931 --> 00:47:41,015
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to make sure that that's understood as a problem, not just being rats, but other pests.

665
00:47:42,979 --> 00:47:43,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

666
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:50,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, G. We will move to iPhone.

667
00:47:51,127 --> 00:47:52,168
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how the name is listed.

668
00:47:52,228 --> 00:47:53,950
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure if it's the same one from before.

669
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,773
[SPEAKER_14]: If it is, maybe you have a new comment.

670
00:47:58,034 --> 00:47:59,235
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

671
00:47:59,315 --> 00:48:01,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Please give us your name and address, and you have two minutes.

672
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:05,542
[SPEAKER_33]: Hi, Chris from Winchester Street.

673
00:48:06,543 --> 00:48:06,783
[SPEAKER_33]: Welcome.

674
00:48:08,062 --> 00:48:16,834
[SPEAKER_33]: I would just like to start off by saying this until a couple of weeks ago when it was on the news, radio, WBZ, television.

675
00:48:17,335 --> 00:48:19,879
[SPEAKER_33]: I think this even made Jimmy Kimmel late night.

676
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:22,262
[SPEAKER_33]: It's even being reported worldwide.

677
00:48:23,163 --> 00:48:29,268
[SPEAKER_33]: I think that it's kind of a crazy idea to go to every two weeks.

678
00:48:30,049 --> 00:48:31,890
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't know where the survey came from.

679
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:33,431
[SPEAKER_33]: Was it mailed to the house or what?

680
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:34,392
[SPEAKER_33]: Never heard of it.

681
00:48:35,053 --> 00:48:40,757
[SPEAKER_33]: The whole thing that I heard about this was media just a few weeks ago.

682
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:43,639
[SPEAKER_33]: So I don't know how long you've been working on this, but

683
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:50,890
[SPEAKER_33]: You gotta look at how long has the public known about what you guys are doing.

684
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:57,211
[SPEAKER_33]: I do not feel that trash pickup every two weeks is a good thing.

685
00:48:58,271 --> 00:49:01,212
[SPEAKER_33]: People have been talking about all the reasons why it's negative.

686
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,433
[SPEAKER_33]: Rats, there's rats everywhere in South Medford.

687
00:49:05,045 --> 00:49:06,566
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't know how you guys don't know that.

688
00:49:07,066 --> 00:49:11,808
[SPEAKER_33]: There's the raccoons, as the other gentleman just mentioned.

689
00:49:12,328 --> 00:49:18,130
[SPEAKER_33]: There's stuff, you know, mattresses just dumped to pay a hundred bucks to get rid of them.

690
00:49:19,771 --> 00:49:25,553
[SPEAKER_33]: I just think that the whole way this is being put out to the people is just not right.

691
00:49:25,593 --> 00:49:30,255
[SPEAKER_33]: You can really take a hard look at yourselves for just throwing this out at the public.

692
00:49:32,396 --> 00:49:36,459
[SPEAKER_33]: And, you know, the other thing that's been brought up is the absentee landlords.

693
00:49:36,479 --> 00:49:39,601
[SPEAKER_33]: A ton of them in South Medford, all over Medford, I'm sure.

694
00:49:39,621 --> 00:49:41,523
[SPEAKER_33]: A ton of them in South Medford with Tufts.

695
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:44,825
[SPEAKER_33]: They couldn't care a crap less about trash.

696
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,546
[SPEAKER_33]: Trash is everywhere over here.

697
00:49:47,727 --> 00:49:57,213
[SPEAKER_33]: I think you really got to take a hard look at maybe putting this on the ballot for the residents to, rather than having this forced on them.

698
00:49:57,574 --> 00:49:57,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

699
00:49:58,907 --> 00:49:59,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

700
00:49:59,207 --> 00:49:59,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate it.

701
00:49:59,828 --> 00:50:02,709
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a raccoon that lives near my house too.

702
00:50:02,789 --> 00:50:03,670
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know the room.

703
00:50:05,091 --> 00:50:06,171
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your feedback.

704
00:50:06,351 --> 00:50:11,614
[SPEAKER_14]: And also my department picks up and pays for those, uh, those dumped mattresses.

705
00:50:11,715 --> 00:50:14,176
[SPEAKER_14]: So I, and I feel them as well.

706
00:50:14,776 --> 00:50:16,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, so that's, that's pretty deep there.

707
00:50:16,918 --> 00:50:17,178
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

708
00:50:17,238 --> 00:50:19,239
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to move on to Sarah.

709
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:22,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Calico asking on mute.

710
00:50:23,261 --> 00:50:25,523
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you could give us your name and address, you'll have two minutes to speak.

711
00:50:25,703 --> 00:50:25,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

712
00:50:29,255 --> 00:50:30,556
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, my name is Sarah.

713
00:50:30,656 --> 00:50:32,097
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm on.

714
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:35,980
[SPEAKER_24]: I am not in favor at this time for the every other week.

715
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:41,984
[SPEAKER_24]: Trash I do already do the composting and we do do the line here.

716
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:42,764
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm.

717
00:50:44,105 --> 00:50:47,887
[SPEAKER_24]: In South Medford, and we have over the past couple of years notice quite the uptick and.

718
00:50:49,164 --> 00:50:49,824
[SPEAKER_24]: different rodents.

719
00:50:50,025 --> 00:50:55,167
[SPEAKER_24]: So I want to know before something like this goes into effect, what is the city going to do?

720
00:50:55,688 --> 00:50:59,370
[SPEAKER_24]: I have logged requests, I have neighbors have logged requests, nothing is being done.

721
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:02,712
[SPEAKER_24]: I have a whole series of port-a-potty outside of my house.

722
00:51:03,492 --> 00:51:07,914
[SPEAKER_24]: And I was told that was going to be gone two weeks and I'm still staring at it.

723
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:13,818
[SPEAKER_24]: They assure me that that's not going to increase, but I can sure tell you on my ring cameras, I can see them every day running in and out.

724
00:51:14,478 --> 00:51:18,523
[SPEAKER_24]: And there's just been no accountability by the city and it's really, really frustrating.

725
00:51:18,863 --> 00:51:20,005
[SPEAKER_24]: Neighbors were very clean.

726
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:26,913
[SPEAKER_24]: There are some neighbors that rent down the street so I'm sure that some of this could be coming from there as well but it's only going to get worse.

727
00:51:27,173 --> 00:51:29,776
[SPEAKER_24]: I also have animals pick the waste removal but also.

728
00:51:30,857 --> 00:51:40,346
[SPEAKER_24]: To the woman who has the elderly mother, I really feel for her and that is a lot of supplies and that's a lot of waste and it's terrible when it's in your home.

729
00:51:40,726 --> 00:51:44,369
[SPEAKER_24]: You're trying to do your best to take care of them and what are we going to do for these family members?

730
00:51:44,549 --> 00:51:48,993
[SPEAKER_24]: This really needs to be considered and the communication needs to be better.

731
00:51:49,013 --> 00:51:50,494
[SPEAKER_24]: The survey was

732
00:51:51,395 --> 00:51:52,115
[SPEAKER_24]: disgraceful.

733
00:51:52,295 --> 00:51:58,777
[SPEAKER_24]: It was so unprofessionally written for a bunch of people who are on a board that are very well educated.

734
00:51:58,877 --> 00:52:03,458
[SPEAKER_24]: So I suggest someone go look into revising that document going forward.

735
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:10,139
[SPEAKER_24]: Additionally, I don't know how much of a 20 seconds left is not everyone goes online, not a phone that text messages.

736
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:15,181
[SPEAKER_24]: So then we need to get to the residents that don't text, don't do QR codes.

737
00:52:15,681 --> 00:52:18,761
[SPEAKER_24]: Like it may be 2026 that many people can't even afford a phone.

738
00:52:18,861 --> 00:52:21,162
[SPEAKER_24]: We need better communication to all of our residents.

739
00:52:21,262 --> 00:52:21,548
[SPEAKER_24]: Bye guys.

740
00:52:23,523 --> 00:52:31,005
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Sarah, just to just to address a couple of well, 1 thing that you said, the board of health has been doing a lot of work.

741
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:32,285
[SPEAKER_14]: I know on rodents.

742
00:52:32,805 --> 00:52:38,787
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I know you don't think that we're doing anything, but I'm not both, but there's lots of resources.

743
00:52:39,227 --> 00:52:41,187
[SPEAKER_14]: They're doing lots of citywide initiatives.

744
00:52:41,527 --> 00:52:51,630
[SPEAKER_14]: We do help with them with some, even the mapping of the incidences in the DPW and also closed containers that hold our food waste is part of reducing rodents as well.

745
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,290
[SPEAKER_14]: I know a lot of people believe.

746
00:52:54,050 --> 00:53:00,475
[SPEAKER_14]: that rodents will increase when you separate and contain the food waste, but that's not what they're finding out there.

747
00:53:00,596 --> 00:53:06,020
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm more concerned about... Sorry, I should have muted you, I'm just trying to address the things that you said.

748
00:53:07,801 --> 00:53:16,468
[SPEAKER_14]: The ordinance, the Board of Health and the City Council just passed a rodent control ordinance too, that's a bolstering of a previous ordinance that they had, so there's a lot of action happening there.

749
00:53:16,648 --> 00:53:18,870
[SPEAKER_14]: The engineering division about that port-a-potty, if you haven't already,

750
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:23,192
[SPEAKER_14]: That sounds like it might be a construction project from the engineering division.

751
00:53:23,592 --> 00:53:24,193
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

752
00:53:24,553 --> 00:53:26,574
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to move on to Dylan Compton.

753
00:53:27,034 --> 00:53:30,956
[SPEAKER_14]: Dylan, if you could give your name and address and let us know.

754
00:53:31,737 --> 00:53:33,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, yeah, your name and address, and you'll have two minutes.

755
00:53:33,518 --> 00:53:33,858
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Dylan.

756
00:53:36,834 --> 00:53:39,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, hi Tim, thanks for taking comments tonight.

757
00:53:40,297 --> 00:53:42,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Dylan Compton, I live on Sunset Avenue.

758
00:53:43,759 --> 00:53:46,541
[SPEAKER_11]: Echo, you know, a lot of the other comments and concerns tonight.

759
00:53:47,662 --> 00:53:59,812
[SPEAKER_11]: I compost, I recycle, I actually don't run out of space in my trash can, but to me I think there's a huge amount of dogs in the neighborhood, there's

760
00:54:01,693 --> 00:54:25,743
[SPEAKER_11]: human waste there's things that become quite odorous and so my concern is almost exclusively with the frequency of pickup and not the the waste reduction goals and so um you know one of my sort of you know you phrase this is looking for questions you've been getting a lot of comments i appreciate you you hanging with us um i think one of my questions is what would it take for us to look at

761
00:54:26,603 --> 00:54:41,915
[SPEAKER_11]: smaller cart sizes on a weekly basis as opposed to a bi-weekly system and like what would the relative cost savings there be if just the tonnage reduction versus the the pickup frequency reduction because that to me feels like potentially a very workable alternative

762
00:54:42,515 --> 00:54:45,597
[SPEAKER_11]: that would address a lot of the commute concerns around the waste.

763
00:54:45,637 --> 00:54:54,702
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's still volume concerns, but that's where pay-as-you-throw really is structured well to solve for that, potentially, where the frequency, it really isn't, right?

764
00:54:54,742 --> 00:55:00,565
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not an option for me to go out and say, hey, I want somebody to pick up my dog's, you know, poop every week.

765
00:55:01,426 --> 00:55:05,468
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's a couple private services for picking up in your yard stuff that we put in our trash right now, right?

766
00:55:07,249 --> 00:55:09,610
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, yeah, I think that's my core question.

767
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:23,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Broadly, I understand where this is coming from and appreciate the city trying to solve for it, but would really like to see us think creatively about how to keep the frequency higher and achieve those tonnage in other ways.

768
00:55:23,935 --> 00:55:24,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

769
00:55:25,356 --> 00:55:25,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Dylan.

770
00:55:25,876 --> 00:55:26,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate the feedback.

771
00:55:28,497 --> 00:55:30,478
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we'll move to Charlotte Cahill.

772
00:55:30,738 --> 00:55:33,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Charlotte, if you could give us your name, you'll have two minutes.

773
00:55:36,947 --> 00:55:37,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you.

774
00:55:38,108 --> 00:55:39,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Charlotte Cahill, Central Ave.

775
00:55:40,351 --> 00:55:41,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I am sneaking in a second comment.

776
00:55:41,933 --> 00:55:44,095
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't be able to get away with it, but I'll make it really short.

777
00:55:44,115 --> 00:55:48,039
[SPEAKER_14]: One is to just say, and I appreciate the fact check on my previous comment where I had the proportion

778
00:55:58,471 --> 00:56:01,375
[SPEAKER_06]: of households represented by the city's composting goal wrong.

779
00:56:01,395 --> 00:56:07,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Remind my sort of larger concern about like, there's going to be food waste in the trash.

780
00:56:07,944 --> 00:56:11,389
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, 100% compliance is not real, I think.

781
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,131
[SPEAKER_06]: I think your comments still made sense.

782
00:56:13,972 --> 00:56:36,577
[SPEAKER_06]: The other point I wanted to make was just to say, and really echoing some of what just before me, is I would love to have more information in whatever FAQ or whatever else you put together on what alternatives to biweekly pickup the city has considered and why you decided against them.

783
00:56:37,197 --> 00:56:40,058
[SPEAKER_06]: So I appreciate here the waste reduction goal.

784
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:44,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that a lot of the comments we're hearing are not pushing back on that.

785
00:56:44,982 --> 00:56:48,345
[SPEAKER_06]: They're pushing back on this particular biweekly approach.

786
00:56:48,746 --> 00:56:54,351
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it would just be really helpful to understand kind of why you thought this was the approach.

787
00:56:54,391 --> 00:57:00,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think about, you know, lots of other communities in Massachusetts have pay-as-you-throw.

788
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:03,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Very few of them are right here in the Boston area.

789
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Malden and Brookline are in it.

790
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:17,071
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know Malden at least has chosen to maintain weekly trash pickup at a lower volume, so I'm just curious about kind of what the options are and why you think this is the right one for Medford.

791
00:57:17,251 --> 00:57:17,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

792
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:22,191
[SPEAKER_14]: Just Charlie, just let you know, your comment did make sense.

793
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:25,853
[SPEAKER_14]: I just needed to correct that fact, just so folks had the correct information.

794
00:57:27,073 --> 00:57:32,235
[SPEAKER_14]: People bringing it up, keep it every week, but reduce the volume.

795
00:57:32,555 --> 00:57:36,557
[SPEAKER_14]: That is an option that was looked at closely, many options.

796
00:57:37,197 --> 00:57:42,919
[SPEAKER_14]: And just so folks know, the cost of collection is a lot higher than the cost of disposal.

797
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:46,861
[SPEAKER_14]: That information is out there.

798
00:57:47,581 --> 00:57:51,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Some was presented tonight and then there'll be more detailed information on the FAQ.

799
00:57:51,824 --> 00:57:53,164
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure once we're done with tonight.

800
00:57:53,485 --> 00:57:53,845
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a lot.

801
00:57:53,965 --> 00:57:56,526
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a lot of people seem to be interested in that, which is great.

802
00:57:56,627 --> 00:57:57,507
[SPEAKER_14]: I love the brainstorming.

803
00:57:57,587 --> 00:57:58,167
[SPEAKER_14]: I love the ideas.

804
00:57:58,568 --> 00:57:59,008
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

805
00:57:59,368 --> 00:58:01,409
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to move to big Haas.

806
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:04,671
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully that's your real name, big Haas.

807
00:58:05,372 --> 00:58:10,535
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're going to, if you could let us know your name and address and you'll have two minutes to speak.

808
00:58:18,323 --> 00:58:20,583
[SPEAKER_14]: because it looks like maybe you clicked it and then clicked it again.

809
00:58:20,603 --> 00:58:25,144
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to ask to unmute again and just this time.

810
00:58:32,706 --> 00:58:34,566
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, well, I'm going to put your hand down.

811
00:58:34,946 --> 00:58:37,367
[SPEAKER_14]: If you would like to try again, please put your hand back up.

812
00:58:37,387 --> 00:58:42,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'm going to move to G Turk.

813
00:58:42,908 --> 00:58:47,649
[SPEAKER_14]: G Turk, I'm going to unmute you and please let us know your name and address and you'll have two minutes.

814
00:58:52,802 --> 00:59:00,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, hi, my name is Gilbert and I'm a Turk and I live on Woods Road in Metzl.

815
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:16,687
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I, you know, I watched the presentation by, you know, environmental issues and, you know, mainly, you know, we want to reduce our waste and we want to reduce everything is done in a proper way.

816
00:59:16,707 --> 00:59:16,767
[SPEAKER_03]: But

817
00:59:18,326 --> 00:59:24,688
[SPEAKER_03]: again, you know, as many other citizens and, you know, express the same concern about rodents.

818
00:59:24,848 --> 00:59:31,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, last year, we had raccoon in our trash bins, summertime when it's really hot, it's terrible.

819
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:40,993
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I mean, you know, I understand, you know, that, you know, I mean, we're not, you know, I don't think

820
00:59:41,668 --> 00:59:59,697
[SPEAKER_03]: We were consulted before this program was implemented, and to convince people that having trucks that were run once every other week would put less strain on streets and roads and would cut down pollution, I mean, it's a joke.

821
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:06,490
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, again, we're paying also more property taxes and getting less services.

822
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:07,790
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

823
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:08,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, go.

824
01:00:09,471 --> 01:00:15,353
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand cities have big trouble closing their budgets, the cost of living everything.

825
01:00:15,953 --> 01:00:20,634
[SPEAKER_03]: But I believe there's way better ideas to implement stuff.

826
01:00:20,834 --> 01:00:27,036
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly, the every other week, you know, program is not the right one.

827
01:00:27,236 --> 01:00:29,497
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe, you know, Metro

828
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:36,503
[SPEAKER_03]: only city which are going to this direction.

829
01:00:37,624 --> 01:00:49,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure what the result is going to be, but I mean, will you allow to, I mean, to change course if things will not go the right way?

830
01:00:49,713 --> 01:00:53,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're open to anything new, but I don't know.

831
01:00:55,177 --> 01:00:55,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, G-Turk.

832
01:00:56,198 --> 01:00:57,299
[SPEAKER_14]: We appreciate the comments.

833
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:01,022
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is, I'm going to say something, but it's nothing to do with what you just said, just in general.

834
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:30,444
[SPEAKER_14]: just been notified maybe they're aware of it didn't seem like it to me and they were masked if and there's only a few more speakers left but no personal attacks no veiled personal attacks we're all people we're trying to do our job here okay so thank you um we're gonna move to i believe he has a new comment to make so i'm gonna i'm gonna uh ask him to unmute and if you could just say your name and address again thank you vinnie

835
01:01:32,507 --> 01:01:33,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Tim.

836
01:01:33,208 --> 01:01:36,490
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is pronounced Vinay.

837
01:01:37,831 --> 01:01:45,058
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also wanted to add to my previous comment that I only put my trash out once or twice a month now.

838
01:01:45,698 --> 01:01:49,661
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have three big dogs and all of their dog poop goes in the trash bin.

839
01:01:50,758 --> 01:01:53,680
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have a rat problem here in West Medford.

840
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's because my trash can is in good condition.

841
01:01:57,963 --> 01:02:08,069
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone else also mentioned before that when used in a secure container, that really restricts the amount of rats or food that critters in general have access to.

842
01:02:08,089 --> 01:02:14,834
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to get to the compost bin, but it was secure enough that it couldn't open it, figure out how to open it.

843
01:02:15,534 --> 01:02:16,795
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to share that as well.

844
01:02:17,895 --> 01:02:18,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

845
01:02:18,676 --> 01:02:20,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate your comments and your feedback.

846
01:02:23,075 --> 01:02:26,316
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Ralph Klein, I believe Ralph spoke, but he may have a new comment.

847
01:02:27,056 --> 01:02:30,557
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to ask him if he could give us his name and address again, and I'll have two minutes.

848
01:02:34,938 --> 01:02:36,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, can you hear me?

849
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:36,938
[SPEAKER_09]: I can.

850
01:02:37,778 --> 01:02:38,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you.

851
01:02:39,459 --> 01:02:45,440
[SPEAKER_09]: All these comments about, you know, the plastic bins, the old containers they used to pick up with metal, they got into them.

852
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,241
[SPEAKER_09]: My trash bins have very little food in them.

853
01:02:49,977 --> 01:02:52,678
[SPEAKER_09]: But there are animals that have chewed through the plastic.

854
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:55,679
[SPEAKER_09]: So these plastic bins should not be used.

855
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,000
[SPEAKER_09]: They're chewing through the regular trash barrels.

856
01:02:58,781 --> 01:03:02,942
[SPEAKER_09]: What makes you think they're not going to chew through these plastics after a while when they find out there's food in there?

857
01:03:03,823 --> 01:03:07,084
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing is all these heavy trash trucks going down the street.

858
01:03:07,124 --> 01:03:10,866
[SPEAKER_09]: They're saying, yeah, how heavy are they going to be every other week?

859
01:03:11,366 --> 01:03:12,346
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not reducing it.

860
01:03:12,806 --> 01:03:14,387
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just pushing it into another week.

861
01:03:15,487 --> 01:03:16,588
[SPEAKER_09]: All the other things come from,

862
01:03:17,632 --> 01:03:18,893
[SPEAKER_09]: stores really that are open.

863
01:03:18,913 --> 01:03:20,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Our stores are closed and left and right.

864
01:03:20,354 --> 01:03:21,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything comes from Amazon wherever.

865
01:03:22,797 --> 01:03:25,579
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where everything, that's where all this trash is generated from.

866
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,621
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to stop local shopping.

867
01:03:30,203 --> 01:03:32,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop and shop where they have the food delivered.

868
01:03:32,486 --> 01:03:36,149
[SPEAKER_09]: They put it in boxes to get rid of their boxes when they deliver it to home.

869
01:03:36,902 --> 01:03:42,627
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, all we have is all these other trucks going down the streets and everybody thinks the electric vehicles are great.

870
01:03:43,048 --> 01:03:44,269
[SPEAKER_09]: They're destroying our streets.

871
01:03:44,329 --> 01:03:49,473
[SPEAKER_09]: They're destroying them in California, that roads in the summer here, the electric vehicles.

872
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:52,456
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they're going to electric trucks, they're even heavier.

873
01:03:52,476 --> 01:03:54,218
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to destroy our roads even more.

874
01:03:55,239 --> 01:03:58,161
[SPEAKER_09]: So why not reduce it by half what you're doing?

875
01:03:58,982 --> 01:03:59,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

876
01:04:00,864 --> 01:04:01,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate the comments, Ralph.

877
01:04:02,829 --> 01:04:13,455
[SPEAKER_14]: have been studying weights of vehicles for a while, and the weight of the vehicles matters, but the number of trips also matters, and the movements, the wheel friction on the road.

878
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:17,257
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's lots of impacts to roads, not the environment per se.

879
01:04:17,277 --> 01:04:19,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, I will move on to Gary.

880
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:20,339
[SPEAKER_14]: Gary, when

881
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:23,673
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear me?

882
01:04:24,073 --> 01:04:24,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah, maybe.

883
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:26,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

884
01:04:26,175 --> 01:04:26,476
[SPEAKER_14]: Gary?

885
01:04:27,016 --> 01:04:27,577
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Gary.

886
01:04:27,657 --> 01:04:27,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

887
01:04:28,237 --> 01:04:29,078
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I didn't even know you.

888
01:04:29,178 --> 01:04:29,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone else must have.

889
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:31,741
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you.

890
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:33,242
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, Gary.

891
01:04:33,583 --> 01:04:44,573
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm here tonight to speak against the proposal to reduce the trash pickup schedule to every other week on the surface, although cutting back may sound like a simple way to save money.

892
01:04:45,454 --> 01:04:48,636
[SPEAKER_32]: In practice, it creates far more problems than it solves.

893
01:04:49,577 --> 01:04:54,780
[SPEAKER_32]: Problems that affect public health, neighborhood cleanliness, and overall quality of life.

894
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:02,104
[SPEAKER_32]: First, less frequent trash pickups means more waste sitting longer in homes and on our curbs.

895
01:05:03,085 --> 01:05:08,148
[SPEAKER_32]: That leads to overflowing bins, very unpleasant odors, and increased pests.

896
01:05:08,948 --> 01:05:17,894
[SPEAKER_32]: We already have rats, raccoons, insects, and bugs near Salem Street and in Fellsway, and these are not minor inconveniences.

897
01:05:17,974 --> 01:05:23,097
[SPEAKER_32]: They're real health concerns, especially for families with children sleeping in multifamily homes.

898
01:05:24,219 --> 01:05:28,441
[SPEAKER_32]: Second, reducing pickup does not reduce waste.

899
01:05:28,621 --> 01:05:30,943
[SPEAKER_32]: It just shifts the burdens onto the residents.

900
01:05:31,103 --> 01:05:36,826
[SPEAKER_32]: Families will be forced to store more trash for longer periods, which is not realistic for most households.

901
01:05:38,127 --> 01:05:43,930
[SPEAKER_32]: Many properties also lack extra storage, and the community relies on regular disposal

902
01:05:45,017 --> 01:05:46,698
[SPEAKER_32]: and will struggle to stay clean.

903
01:05:47,638 --> 01:05:52,219
[SPEAKER_32]: Third, this change risks making our community look neglected.

904
01:05:52,859 --> 01:06:00,021
[SPEAKER_32]: Overflowing bins and illegal dumping become much more common when people don't have adequate disposal options.

905
01:06:00,942 --> 01:06:04,723
[SPEAKER_32]: That hurts property values and undermines the pride we take in our community.

906
01:06:05,803 --> 01:06:11,685
[SPEAKER_32]: At my home, we already recycle, and we're already signed up for composting, even always full.

907
01:06:12,065 --> 01:06:14,346
[SPEAKER_32]: There's never a week when our bin is not full.

908
01:06:15,066 --> 01:06:20,628
[SPEAKER_32]: We have two young children who are in diapers, and it's all quite awful.

909
01:06:21,668 --> 01:06:27,270
[SPEAKER_32]: Our bin already smells awful as is, and I can't imagine what it would be like with every other week pickup.

910
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:28,230
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

911
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:29,651
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Gary.

912
01:06:29,671 --> 01:06:31,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate your comments.

913
01:06:31,111 --> 01:06:33,092
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to move to

914
01:06:34,542 --> 01:06:37,486
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all one word, Judith Weinstock.

915
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:40,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Judith, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

916
01:06:40,471 --> 01:06:44,617
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could give us your name and address for the record, and you'll have two minutes to speak.

917
01:06:48,427 --> 01:06:49,847
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, my name is Judith Weinstock.

918
01:06:49,887 --> 01:06:51,568
[SPEAKER_16]: I live at 144 Burgett.

919
01:06:52,268 --> 01:06:59,050
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm actually a little surprised, not at the comments about going to every other week.

920
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:03,691
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually think the city seriously needs to revisit that if it's not too late.

921
01:07:03,751 --> 01:07:05,612
[SPEAKER_16]: In other words, if a contract's already been signed.

922
01:07:06,912 --> 01:07:08,673
[SPEAKER_16]: then this is all somewhat moot.

923
01:07:09,353 --> 01:07:16,276
[SPEAKER_16]: But I would like to comment on the composting program, which I think is pretty phenomenal.

924
01:07:16,817 --> 01:07:18,737
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just want to focus on it first.

925
01:07:18,777 --> 01:07:24,040
[SPEAKER_16]: There's some kudos deserved by the city and by the company that you've contracted with.

926
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,481
[SPEAKER_16]: I only started doing it about three months ago.

927
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:32,984
[SPEAKER_16]: It was remarkable how easy I found it, but I think that the city could actually work

928
01:07:33,704 --> 01:07:40,528
[SPEAKER_16]: much harder on encouraging many, many, many more houses to do it because it is a relatively simple program.

929
01:07:40,568 --> 01:07:57,257
[SPEAKER_16]: But I also think that the city, just as you did with rain barrel options for people years ago, people do have to go out, they have to buy a bin for their internal collection, they have to buy those bags, they have to buy the bags for the bin that you provide for free.

930
01:07:57,277 --> 01:08:03,040
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it would be great if the city could provide some additional resources, potentially bulk buying and discounting.

931
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:07,544
[SPEAKER_16]: for in-home bins that people have to use for that program.

932
01:08:07,865 --> 01:08:18,976
[SPEAKER_16]: I would love to see the city at this point, with all this feedback, decouple these programs and begin to focus 100% on increasing the number of households who are doing composting

933
01:08:20,057 --> 01:08:28,221
[SPEAKER_16]: now and for the future and work longer and harder on solving some of the really important issues at PNight.

934
01:08:28,261 --> 01:08:29,402
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they're legitimate.

935
01:08:30,142 --> 01:08:31,083
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't affect me.

936
01:08:31,183 --> 01:08:32,944
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a single-person household.

937
01:08:33,084 --> 01:08:34,264
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't fill my bin.

938
01:08:34,644 --> 01:08:36,706
[SPEAKER_16]: Please don't come by and drop your stuff here.

939
01:08:38,146 --> 01:08:45,330
[SPEAKER_16]: But I really think you're hearing some really serious concerns that need serious fixes before you implement the program.

940
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:46,871
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for that.

941
01:08:48,752 --> 01:08:49,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Judith.

942
01:08:50,817 --> 01:08:55,362
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll say comments and feedback are not moot.

943
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:57,884
[SPEAKER_14]: We're trying to identify gaps, respond to feedback.

944
01:08:58,165 --> 01:09:00,367
[SPEAKER_14]: There's flexibility within the signed contracts.

945
01:09:00,927 --> 01:09:06,173
[SPEAKER_14]: There are contractual dates and milestones that we have to meet certain things and make certain decisions.

946
01:09:06,813 --> 01:09:18,442
[SPEAKER_14]: And because of the pay-as-you-throw relationship, it's actually been coupled as opposed to decoupled because they feed off of each other and it's part of one whole program.

947
01:09:19,022 --> 01:09:22,405
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully that helps clarify things for folks.

948
01:09:22,905 --> 01:09:24,046
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely not moot at all.

949
01:09:24,567 --> 01:09:33,013
[SPEAKER_14]: This information is incredibly valuable to us, to apps, and take those flexibilities and continue to design the program over the next year and a half, really.

950
01:09:34,094 --> 01:09:35,335
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's what we're looking at.

951
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:47,239
[SPEAKER_14]: That's everybody who has their hands up and I'll just give, it's 8, 10, if there are other folks who would like to speak, now's your chance.

952
01:09:48,140 --> 01:10:00,130
[SPEAKER_14]: If not, I'm gonna, I suppose, I don't know if we have, I don't recall if we had any closing planned, but I don't know if Steve, you wanted to say anything or anybody else wanted to say anything or if we should just log off.

953
01:10:00,866 --> 01:10:07,728
[SPEAKER_21]: Kim, we have one other comment from the person, Big Hoss, who had trouble, do you want me to just read that one?

954
01:10:08,949 --> 01:10:10,609
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, yeah.

955
01:10:11,129 --> 01:10:13,850
[SPEAKER_21]: My name is Amy and I live on Princeton Street.

956
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:15,211
[SPEAKER_21]: I do not have a resident.

957
01:10:15,271 --> 01:10:17,652
[SPEAKER_21]: He should have muted her so that he could speak over her.

958
01:10:18,072 --> 01:10:21,273
[SPEAKER_21]: There seems to be a huge disregard for the residents you are serving.

959
01:10:21,953 --> 01:10:24,354
[SPEAKER_21]: I am a mother and can't tell you how many trash weekly.

960
01:10:24,874 --> 01:10:27,635
[SPEAKER_21]: It's insane to announce this during a cost of living crisis.

961
01:10:28,113 --> 01:10:32,003
[SPEAKER_21]: for the population of your residence, which is families, elders, and students.

962
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:34,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

963
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to clarify, I was not being disrespectful in any sense of the word.

964
01:10:38,022 --> 01:10:44,326
[SPEAKER_14]: The mechanics of this particular meeting and the way it was formatted doesn't give me particularly a lot of flexibility.

965
01:10:44,386 --> 01:10:47,188
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how we agreed to have a Q&A open dialogue.

966
01:10:47,528 --> 01:10:53,812
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really to receive feedback, and my role is to correct things that maybe are facts that are wrong.

967
01:10:54,572 --> 01:10:56,714
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully that explains it.

968
01:10:56,734 --> 01:10:59,335
[SPEAKER_14]: I certainly didn't mean anybody any disrespect whatsoever.

969
01:10:59,916 --> 01:11:01,376
[SPEAKER_14]: So I hope you can appreciate that.

970
01:11:02,397 --> 01:11:07,651
[SPEAKER_14]: With that said, if there's nobody else to speak tonight, we can wrap it up.

971
01:11:09,556 --> 01:11:10,318
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have other

972
01:11:12,553 --> 01:11:16,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Scheduled events January 28th is at City Hall.

973
01:11:16,575 --> 01:11:17,696
[SPEAKER_14]: That's at 6 p.m.

974
01:11:17,836 --> 01:11:20,277
[SPEAKER_14]: January 28th at 6 p.m.

975
01:11:20,397 --> 01:11:22,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford City Hall, City Council Chambers.

976
01:11:23,358 --> 01:11:27,480
[SPEAKER_14]: There were a lot of comments or a few comments at the beginning about how this was only on Zoom.

977
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,200
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not.

978
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:30,781
[SPEAKER_14]: There's educational workshops that are going to be taking place as well.

979
01:11:31,441 --> 01:11:33,902
[SPEAKER_14]: There's lots.

980
01:11:34,203 --> 01:11:36,063
[SPEAKER_14]: So we appreciate everybody's feedback tonight.

981
01:11:37,144 --> 01:11:37,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

982
01:11:41,403 --> 01:11:44,005
[SPEAKER_14]: Steve, do you wanna call it, say goodnight?

983
01:11:44,525 --> 01:11:46,807
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, I didn't get to see no other questions.

984
01:11:47,047 --> 01:11:51,349
[SPEAKER_30]: As Tim said, we're gonna have an in-person meeting on the 28th of January at 6 p.m.

985
01:11:51,369 --> 01:11:51,930
[SPEAKER_30]: at City Hall.

986
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:57,273
[SPEAKER_30]: A recording of this meeting will also be available on our website, on the city's YouTube, and on MCM.

987
01:11:58,234 --> 01:12:06,339
[SPEAKER_30]: And please head over if you have any other questions, or if you have any other questions after this meeting ends, and you wanna answer it, please email us at waste at medford-ma.gov.

988
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:15,294
