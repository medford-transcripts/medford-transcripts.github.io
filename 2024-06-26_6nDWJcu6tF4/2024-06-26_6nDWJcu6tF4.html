    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=540.274s">Just</a>  like to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=544.115s">When</a>  I was a member of the CPA, Tom Lincoln, he was one of our frequent customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=552.56s">He</a>  just brought in application after application to repair the Brooks Estate, and he's the driving force behind the upkeep of that property today. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=562.985s">This</a>  is just a case of an <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=566.707s">ordinary</a>  citizen of Medford, seeing something that they wanted preserved, seeing a project that they could really get behind, and putting their time and energy into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=577.116s">And</a>  it's really paid off. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=578.777s">I</a>  look forward to telling Mr. Lincoln how much I admire him when he does come to the next city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=589.005s">Congratulations,</a>  Mr. Lincoln. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=591.127s">You're</a>  a great citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=592.548s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=594.149s">Any</a>  further comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=595.15s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=596.63s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=598.231s">I</a>  think it's one thing to take a stroll through the Brooks Park, you know, by oneself or with friends or with family. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=605.054s">It's</a>  another to get a personal tour from Mr. Lincoln, which I was very lucky to do when I first took office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=611.177s">And</a>  it really is incredible hearing that kind of layers deep history of all of the work <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=618.201s">volunteer</a>  work, community work, just layers of investment that go into making this really such a jewel in the community, the outdoor space, the historic preservation that the community gets to enjoy more and more every year as the renovation continues to go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=632.954s">So</a>  my heartfelt thanks to Mr. Lincoln, you know, really an incredible, an incredible legacy to leave in Medford, to leave the Brooks Park estate so improved. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=644.364s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=646.377s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=647.538s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=648.618s">Mr.</a>  Lincoln's efforts, I think, have really put the Brooks Estate on the map in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=654.961s">His</a>  work, people don't see it, but behind the scenes, he's spending so much time going to events, informing people about MBEL, about the Brooks Estate, giving tours to counselors, giving tours to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=668.027s">His</a>  work, I think, will be dearly missed by, and the next person will have huge shoes to pull. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=675.796s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=677.077s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=680.62s">Every</a>  community should have a Tom Lincoln. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=682.862s">I</a>  admire Tom for his conviction of what he believes in, and Tom was the person that fought for what he believed in. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=691.309s">And</a>  if anybody wants to know why the Brooks Estates is still standing and why it's still a great piece of our community, it's because of Tom Lincoln. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=701.337s">So</a>  I can't wait to see him and shake his hand and thank him because he put a lot of time and effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=708.56s">There</a>  are many, many nights that we would butt heads and not agree, but we would always respect each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=717.185s">And</a>  I admire what he did for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=720.286s">And</a>  hopefully someone's ready to pick up that torch. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=723.147s">So</a>  thank you, Tom.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=725.489s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=727.09s">And</a>  I have been lucky to serve now for five years as the City Council's representative on the MBELT board and work with Tom. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=736.455s">And</a>  Tom's tenacity, his experiences, frustration with the pace of change are all something that I've come <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=745.427s">to</a>  know very well, and I am excited to thank him and congratulate him. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=749.688s">He</a>  is going to keep working with the Brooks Estate and on the Brooks Estate, which I think is fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=755.949s">We</a>  also have a new president, Carly Nesson, a Medford resident who stepped up to take on the role, and we're really excited to see what the next 30 years at the Brooks Estate looks like as we hope to finalize the master plan that was started 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=772.172s">Much</a>  of it has been done in terms of the restoration of the building, and now it is time to build the access drive, finish the restoration, and make sure that everyone in every part of Medford can access the wonderful open space that is the Brooks Estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=785.321s">So</a>  thank you all for your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=788.143s">I'm</a>  sure Tom appreciates them, and is there a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=793.507s">On</a>  the motion approved by Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=797.33s">Madam</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=820.678s">Yes,</a>  seven from the affirmative and the negative, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=823.719s">24-430,</a>  be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we congratulate Sylvia de Placido on her retirement as assistant city clerk and thank her for her decades of public service to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=836.521s">Before</a>  I go to councilors, I do have a statement from the city clerk who could not be here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=842.102s">He</a>  didn't know when he made plans that Sylvia would be retiring, so he's traveling, but he did want to say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=849.397s">He</a>  said, inside room 103, I am the city clerk, but Sylvia is the boss. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=854.679s">Capitalized.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=856.299s">Even</a>  though I am a Springsteen fan of more than four decades, Sylvia is still the boss. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=861.561s">She</a>  gave this city 32 years of selfless, dedicated service. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=864.762s">If</a>  we count Dorothy Donahue's tenure as acting city clerk, and we should, then Sylvia has worked with four different city clerks, beginning with Joe McGonigal. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=871.884s">She</a>  knows everything there is to know about the city clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=874.185s">She's</a>  our living encyclopedia for literally everything our office touches. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=878.306s">Sylvia</a>  leads by example. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=880.007s">Behind</a>  her seemingly gruff exterior is one of the kindest, funniest people we will ever know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=884.248s">Sylvia's</a>  patience and humor have pulled our entire team through some particularly challenging times. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=889.149s">She</a>  has been an incredible teacher and mentor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=891.57s">She</a>  is completely unafraid to tell me what I need to know, when and how I need to know it, in words that are unequivocal and easy to comprehend. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=898.232s">She</a>  is constitutionally incapable of sugarcoating anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=902.062s">These</a>  are virtues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=903.983s">I</a>  will miss Sylvia's daily presence, but she's about to find out that she's only a phone call away. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=908.664s">I'm</a>  thrilled for her as she embarks on her hard-earned, well-deserved retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=912.325s">My</a>  hope for her is nothing but happiness and more priceless time on the lake with Peter, Michael, Peter, Mark, and her beloved grandchildren. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=919.687s">Well</a>  done, boss. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=920.747s">Well</a>  done, and thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=922.388s">It</a>  bears repeating.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=947.102s">Let's</a>  say some nice things So we have known your family a long time and I just want to commend you and thank you and <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=964.181s">It's</a>  people like Sylvia that kept Medford moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=967.783s">I</a>  know people think today's times might be a little difficult, but I remember some really tough times in Medford, and it's the people that made this building what it was and what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=980.211s">And</a>  it's people like yourself that I personally am gonna miss, and it's like, I think that it's a piece of history that'll be walking out the door, but at the same time, you left a legacy here that I hope <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=993.9s">everybody</a>  would follow because you've done an amazing job for our citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=998.063s">And</a>  I know that this is going to sound bad, but I know you get paid every week and not a lot, but what you gave to us is priceless and we thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1008.732s">So</a>  thank you for everything you've done for the city and enjoy retirement.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1017.381s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1019.682s">Sylvia,</a>  thank you so much for so many years of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1023.164s">Congratulations</a>  on your retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1025.845s">It</a>  is really hard to imagine the clerk's office without you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1029.786s">And</a>  I think about the moments in my life in Medford that you have been there for when I filed for a business permit, when I pulled papers for the first time, when I took my first oath of office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1039.931s">And</a>  I know there's so many people doing things that really contribute to the fabric of Medford, whether it's business permits or virtual licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1048.055s">you</a>  know, applying for various things in the city of Medford, they have to go through you and your colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1053.678s">And</a>  you've been such an integral part of what that experience is like, of people trying to shape their life in various ways, shape their contributions to Medford in various ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1063.885s">And</a>  what an incredible role to inhabit for so many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1067.367s">So</a>  my thanks go out to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1069.028s">I</a>  think 32 years of public service really tells you a lot about a person and how they choose to live their life in service to their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1076.474s">I</a>  wish you only the very best for a very long and happy retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1079.917s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1082.38s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1082.74s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1084.782s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1085.202s">I</a>  really can't beat the city clerk's words, but <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1090.965s">Sylvia,</a>  I think you're the person I think of when I think of the clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1095.088s">You've</a>  been there since day dot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1096.849s">And</a>  when I walk in and I see your smile and I see you at your desk, it really lifts my mood in my day, no matter how a meeting in City Hall has gone that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1110.055s">go</a>  on, you know, family trips, I always make sure to bring something small back for the clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1115.08s">And</a>  I always think that would still be appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1118.564s">You</a>  truly are the bedrock of the clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1122.008s">I've</a>  heard it said that the clerk's office is like the front desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1126.192s">for</a>  City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1128.033s">So</a>  many people interact with the clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1131.575s">So</a>  many people come to you and ask questions about where to go in City Hall, where to find services. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1137.318s">And</a>  you're always there with a smiling face day after day, helping our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1141.92s">And</a>  I think that service, that long career of service to our residents should really be highly esteemed and really highly celebrated.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1155.006s">Councilor</a>  Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1156.479s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1157.16s">Just</a>  keep mine short and I'll say Sylvia, we love you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1160.605s">We'll</a>  miss you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1161.646s">We'll</a>  miss your humor and your presence in the clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1168.055s">I</a>  don't think that <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1169.844s">The</a>  clerks often get enough credit for all the work that they do behind the scenes and all the institutional knowledge that they bring to City Council and City Hall and the help either just with purely procedural stuff or just with moral support when we've had a rough evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1191.318s">And</a>  Sylvia will be dearly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1194.42s">That</a>  being said, enjoy retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1197.242s">Have</a>  a good time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1198.323s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1200.882s">Thank</a>  you and just I want to say congratulations and your service has been so appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1209.164s">And</a>  my three terms, my first term, I didn't get to know as well because you were in here and many of us were not in this building during the pandemic, but you were here with the clerk's team processing birth certificates, marriages, death certificates. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1223.449s">I</a>  mean, it is the basics of civic life that run through our clerk's office, nevermind council agendas, which may not be the basics, but there's something. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1235.086s">since</a>  I've been vice president, now president, especially this past couple of years, I've spent a lot of time in the clerk's office and I've appreciated your humor, your welcoming me and pointing out that I may be sitting at the desk too much and shouldn't be an honorary member of the clerk's team as often, but always made me feel welcome and always tried to feed me candy and cookies, which, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1261.923s">I</a>  appreciate and my doctor regrets. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1264.044s">So</a>  it's been a real joy to spend time with you, Sylvia, and to get to know you and to see the end of many years of service, just the last tail end. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1275.991s">I</a>  didn't get to see the first 26 years, but the last few have been a privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1280.554s">So</a>  congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1282.195s">Enjoy</a>  the pontoon boat with the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1285.357s">And</a>  I'll miss having you here too. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1287.938s">When</a>  Adam wasn't here, it's been great to chair meetings with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1291.772s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1294.093s">Would</a>  anyone from the public like to speak on this item? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1298.535s">You</a>  can come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1304.478s">All</a>  right, Madam Clerk, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1307.739s">Well,</a>  I need a motion first. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1308.9s">Is</a>  there a motion?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1366.161s">It's</a>  a happy day to get to congratulate two, you know, two civil servants with such incredible longevity and a history of so many years of contribution to our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1375.043s">To</a>  be able to congratulate two on retirement in just one evening is really a happy thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1379.545s">It's</a>  also a little bittersweet to say goodbye to two members, you know, two contributors to City Hall who have been so present for so many years, been of service to this council and to the community, you know, in ways personal and professional for such a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1397.25s">Janice,</a>  congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1398.47s">Thank</a>  you so much for your many years of hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1401.392s">Thank</a>  you for, you know, bringing not only your hard work, but your personality to this city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1406.895s">We're</a>  sad to see you go, but again, best wishes for a joyful and long retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1412.158s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1479.142s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1480.523s">Janice</a>  DePace, I've known Janice for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1485.347s">I</a>  remember her children participating in sports, and I remember teaching with Janice while she was at Medford High School, and now she's... <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1498.795s">on</a>  to bigger and better things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1500.056s">I'm</a>  so excited for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1501.216s">She's</a>  just a great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1502.837s">If</a>  you know Janice DePace, she has a smile on her face and a special word for you just to keep, just to make sure you have a great day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1509.679s">And</a>  she was like that with her students. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1511.72s">And</a>  I think that everybody that crossed her path. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1514.241s">So</a>  she'll be missing the clerk's office, but she's earned an amazing retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1520.664s">So</a>  congratulations, my friend.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1525.266s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1525.606s">Now</a>  I'm gonna read from the clerk about Janice. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1532.793s">Janice</a>  does a little of everything in our office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1534.775s">She</a>  brought vast knowledge and experience with her when she came to City Hall from the schools, and she has transformed operations for our team. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1541.481s">She</a>  has been a go-to resource for businesses, dog owners, restaurants, retail establishments, and anybody who needs information related to city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1548.627s">Speaking</a>  of go-to resources, she's been a go-to resource for everybody at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1552.87s">She</a>  arrived at the clerk's office with a large network of teachers and former students, all of whom she remembers by name, when they arrive in Room 103 for copies of their birth certificates, to file their marriage intentions, and to renew their dog licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1564.517s">and</a>  all of whom remember her by name with kind words as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1567.299s">Janice</a>  nails our customer service mission every single day, leading with kindness. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1571.323s">She</a>  has passion for her job, combined with skills that can't be taught in any training session, along with a cosmetology license for anybody who might need a quick cut or trim. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1579.65s">She</a>  enjoys our customers and her colleagues, and they enjoy her. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1582.772s">She</a>  leaves City Hall with many years of service to our city and our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1585.935s">I'm</a>  grateful for the work that she's done and for her friendship, commitment, and humor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1589.438s">She</a>  has made our city a better place in which to live and work. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1591.96s">I</a>  wish her the best on her next adventure. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1596.175s">And</a>  I will just say to Janice that it has also been a privilege to serve and see her service in the clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1606.082s">Similarly</a>  to Sylvia, Janice has always made me feel welcome in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1611.466s">We</a>  always have a story to exchange or a bit of news to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1617.231s">But</a>  I think especially something to say is, I think it's both a testament to their <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1624.144s">being</a>  great colleagues and friends, but also a loss at the same time that Janice and Sylvia get to go out together. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1632.007s">They</a>  both get to retire luckily at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1634.648s">And</a>  I think maybe neither of them could have imagined serving without the other in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1640.59s">So</a>  they both have dedicated so many years of service and are able to step out into their retirement or their next adventure. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1650.134s">together,</a>  and I think that's a beautiful story. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1652.055s">So,</a>  with that, is there a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1655.876s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Tseng to approve, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1696.758s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1698.36s">Mrs.</a>  Lasky was my fourth grade teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1702.464s">She</a>  is such a legendary teacher that even before I made it to fourth grade, she was the cool teacher that everyone wanted to be in her class. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1713.554s">She</a>  did so many creative activities with students. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1718.019s">I</a>  remember <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1719.7s">she</a>  used to run classroom elections, and everyone got really excited and involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1725.125s">And</a>  even if you didn't get a spot, I think you felt a buy-in into the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1729.61s">You</a>  felt like you were part of a group of people working together and building a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1735.435s">That's</a>  something that she did so, so well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1737.537s">I</a>  think I remember <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1739.699s">It's</a>  so funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1740.999s">I</a>  remember after a parent-teacher meeting that I wasn't at, she gave my parents really outside-of-the-box tips for how to get me out of my shell and how to get me more comfortable just making friends and speaking out for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1760.583s">And</a>  those tips, I think, have carried through with me through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1765.064s">And</a>  I hope I've done you well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1771.381s">Another,</a>  I think, amazing moment was when Mrs. Lasky brought in her husband, Fred, to teach us about the MWRA and to teach us so much about how the water system works here in Medford and why water conservation is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1786.87s">And</a>  it's small memories like that that I think really lead to the happiness of a childhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1794.434s">It's</a>  all those nostalgic memories that we look <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1796.975s">At</a>  least I'm looking back on a lot recently with all these retirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1802.7s">Mrs.</a>  Lasky, thank you for your service. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1804.962s">Thank</a>  you for your 25 years of service to the Medford Public Schools and for helping them since 2001. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1811.228s">You</a>  mean so, so much, not just to me, but to so many members of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1818.054s">I</a>  really want to both celebrate <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1820.836s">this</a>  moment, and to say that I will be sad that when I go back to the McGlynn, I won't see you there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1827.098s">But</a>  I know I will see you around Medford, and I look forward to seeing you around a lot more often now.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1837.061s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1839.742s">To</a>  the Babe Ruth and Willie Mays of the teaching profession. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1846.772s">I</a>  wanna thank Mrs. Lasky because I had the honor not only to be a parent of a child in her class, but also a colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1855.474s">And</a>  you were the pinnacle. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1859.475s">You</a>  were what everybody wanted to aspire to as colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1863.416s">And</a>  you never, you never wavered in your emotions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1872.117s">You</a>  were just a great teacher <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1875.441s">You</a>  were there for every single child. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1877.783s">And</a>  I know the impact you made in my child's life. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1880.145s">You</a>  know, dad's an elected official, but my son could care less about politics until he ran for fourth grade president. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1890.786s">And</a>  he woke up one morning with a suit on and he says, dad, can you hold this behind me? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1895.367s">I</a>  said, what is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1896.267s">He</a>  said, it's American flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1897.628s">And</a>  I said, what are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1898.588s">He</a>  says, I'm going to give my speech with someone holding the American flag behind me. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1902.729s">And</a>  I said, how come you didn't carry it with what dad's doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1906.049s">He</a>  says, you weren't in Miss Lasky's class. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1908.45s">And</a>  to Justin's point, I remember when he came home one day, he met Mr. Lasky and he says, I know what I want to do for my future, dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1918.132s">I</a>  said, why, what do you want to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1919.153s">He</a>  says, I met Mr. Lasky, and I want to be the reason why we clean Mystic the lake so we can all swim. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1927.021s">And</a>  just those impacts that we made, the growth and respect to our environment, the little lessons that became huge lessons today. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1941.024s">I</a>  thank you from the bottom of my heart because it takes a village to raise your children. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1944.686s">And</a>  we were very fortunate, the Scarpelli household, to have you as one of our children's teachers and teaching them from right and wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1952.591s">So</a>  we thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1954.312s">You</a>  earned the retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1956.393s">I</a>  know there's a huge void at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1958.354s">I</a>  remember when we started, that was the A-Team, remember? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1961.356s">And</a>  to be in the same breath <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1963.217s">as</a>  you know, I think was by default with my position, but to be in the same breath as when they called the 18 and talk and stand side by side with Don Alaska gave me a sense of pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1973.529s">So</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1974.99s">Thank</a>  you for all your work and enjoy the retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1978.414s">So</a>  thanks.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1980.316s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1983.017s">I</a>  was neither a student or a parent or a colleague of Donna Lasky, but I was a student at Medford High with a Lasky child. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1992.062s">And</a>  I just know the impact that that family has had at multiple generations on this community and the service they provided to the city and to our young people. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2001.666s">So</a>  I'm incredibly grateful for Donna and for all of you for being in Medford and giving so much to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2008.993s">Any</a>  further comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2011.194s">Would</a>  anyone from the public like to speak?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2015.074s">I</a>  would like, if we can, Mr. President, is bring Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2017.735s">Lasky</a>  back, and we send her off with one of those wonderful citations that you draw up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2024.537s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2024.737s">That'd</a>  be great if we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2025.817s">You</a>  got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2026.377s">Maybe</a>  invite the whole Lasky family, because I know we haven't seen them for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2031.038s">But</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2482.352s">I</a>  think the Department of Public Works committee makes the most sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2487.774s">Councilor</a>  Callahan is the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2490.726s">I</a>  think because it's to do with traffic, changing the roadways and intersections there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2498.268s">That</a>  intersection, it's the one right below the overpass of Route 16, the bridge over the river, right by deep cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2508.951s">It's</a>  a very busy intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2510.412s">The</a>  Massachusetts Department of Transportation is <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2517.921s">in</a>  charge of it, but it is really integral to how the center of Medford operates. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2525.507s">And</a>  I think it's important that we make sure that the community is involved and we have a lot of stakeholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2533.854s">And</a>  I think it would be a great opportunity for that committee to have a fruitful discussion and make sure that we're sharing our opinions on how best to address improvements</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2837.283s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2838.484s">So</a>  first I want to commend the neighbors and the residents that really pulled together. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2845.509s">And</a>  what you see in front of you is what happens when you see that something might affect our neighborhood in a negative way. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2855.276s">What</a>  I found amazing is I went to an organization, a group of neighbors put together a meeting at the Fireman's Club, and I think probably about 130 people showed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2866.007s">And</a>  what we heard from everybody there with respect and honor to every individual involved was that nobody was against the process of helping people. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2879.693s">But</a>  what everybody was looking for is making sure that this facility or a facility like this would be put in a location where it didn't affect residential neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2894.986s">It's</a>  amazing to see the community rally around this and really start a grassroots quick organization to really rally around and just educate people. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2906.438s">And</a>  I think that's what's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2908.24s">I</a>  think that we have, what I realized in those conversations, there were some people very angry at George Scapelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2915.988s">and</a>  deservedly so. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2918.349s">I</a>  think this is something that we talked about with our leadership team here that when we did the recodification of our zoning and we implemented these type of facilities in the medical field, in the zoning process, that it was then going to go to a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2937.714s">We</a>  realized the impact it could have now legally <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2942.904s">with</a>  the facility like a methadone, and people keep saying clinic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2947.025s">And</a>  what really brought a lot of people to their feet was it's not a clinic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2950.847s">There</a>  weren't people there to assist people that were addicted, but it was just a distribution site. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2958.249s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2959.798s">We</a>  had people that were involved that were both former recovering addicts, and we talked to administrators in the field, and they really shared an input that really educated a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2974.425s">And</a>  again, at the end of the discussion, it wasn't that, let's keep these people out of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2980.007s">No,</a>  it was, if it's needed in Medford, let's find a location where <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2986.164s">they</a>  can get their help and the support, but at the same time not affect a residential area that's. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2992.97s">Feeds</a>  away from a dance studio, a school, the lack of parking in that area affecting small businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3001.596s">So</a>  there were a lot of little intricacies that played a huge part in what that neighborhood, the effects it would have had in the Salem Street neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3012.024s">I</a>  commend the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3012.844s">I</a>  think that I had some issues because we wanted to make sure that without a city solicitor, I reached out to the mayor this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3023.194s">She</a>  had an attorney that's well-versed in these topics to call me to make sure that we didn't say something that would get us in trouble later. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3033.028s">And</a>  I think that with this motion, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3037.918s">And</a>  as this process started moving forward, you saw that everybody was listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3042.561s">You</a>  saw that every department in the city was listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3045.362s">The</a>  mayor was listening, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3047.783s">The</a>  Board of Appeals said, one of the biggest questions was, well, how do we make this a hybrid meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3053.106s">Because</a>  there are people that couldn't make a Zoom meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3056.648s">So</a>  making it, opening it up to everybody in the community so everybody had an input in this decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3066.986s">My</a>  motion tonight would still be for a moratorium moving forward, but working directly with Mrs. Hunt and the mayor's office and making sure that we look at our zoning to make sure that any <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3084.225s">Any</a>  facilities under this criteria are moved into non-residential areas where it won't affect our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3093.552s">So</a>  again, there's still a process, but that would be my recommendation and my resolution if we can, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3101.797s">I</a>  know that the meetings are hybrid, so everybody can still attend those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3108.182s">That</a>  was very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3109.823s">And</a>  again, I can't thank <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3114.994s">This</a>  sometimes is elected official, you look back and you say, geez, with this process, sometimes being a politician, you get, you know, your colleagues have one way of thinking, you have another way of thinking, and kind of get a little discouraged. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3127.683s">But</a>  one thing you do know is that you all love the city of Medford, and we're all fighting for the right reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3134.128s">And</a>  what I saw <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3136.857s">this</a>  past week with community members rallying together to make sure everybody was heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3143.503s">What</a>  I loved, there was, you know, I'm getting phone calls from young people that have young children in the schools that just moved to Method a few years ago, but in the same breath, they were <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3156.394s">introducing</a>  me to their 88-year-old neighbor that they were making sure that they felt comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3161.884s">And</a>  that's what's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3163.226s">We</a>  really took care of our neighbors with this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3166.271s">And</a>  again, I'm going to say this again because we talked about this issue too. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3171.411s">This</a>  wasn't to divide at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3172.852s">I</a>  know that people are looking at social media and saying, this part of the city is saying, suck it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3177.356s">This</a>  part of the city is saying this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3179.137s">These</a>  people are saying that, you know, shame on you for not wanting to take care of people that need support. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3185.642s">That</a>  was never the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3187.464s">With</a>  everybody I talked to, it was an open mind, but with the goal of making sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3193.849s">These</a>  types of facilities are located in the community that doesn't affect our residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3201.512s">So</a>  I give them all the respect and pats on the back that they deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3209.636s">And</a>  I appreciate this company that realized that maybe this isn't the way to go and didn't want to continue with the fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3223.852s">For</a>  now, Salem Street is in a better place right now because there were a lot of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3230.855s">And</a>  it wasn't just what people would think that with the methadone distribution site coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3237.557s">People</a>  were concerned about the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3239.058s">People</a>  were concerned about the small businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3243.319s">And</a>  people were concerned about that whole corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3245.7s">And</a>  I think that it was really expressed in a mature, responsible, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3253.304s">diplomatic</a>  and not divisional conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3258.267s">So</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3259.828s">And</a>  I will tell you, I am so impressed with, and as I move forward, I'll put a motion through Mr. President later on, that we convene a community engagement committee that brings in the talent we have in our community, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3279.755s">You</a>  know, there are some amazing people that are in the field of addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3286.556s">There</a>  are amazing people that are engineers, and there's amazing people that work with traffic studies, and there are doctors, and there are legal minds that really came out and shared their expertise for the greater good. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3302.68s">Not</a>  to be negative, not to go one way or the other, but really to share an opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3308.101s">I</a>  commend everybody here for being here and following through with something that they knew that was going to impact their neighborhood and this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3316.323s">So</a>  I'm glad to see that a wrong is righted and we'll be working hopefully after we pass this resolution that we work with the mayor's office and the community development team and really try to change that zoning so we're not in this position again that we're making sure that if it's needed then <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3337.307s">we'll</a>  have a location where it's not gonna impact the community like it has in last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3341.214s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3343.218s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3378.797s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3379.377s">And</a>  thank you, Councilor Scarpa. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3380.458s">I</a>  think we have noted here that all of the parties involved, whether it's the city council and city councilors or planning office or residents and community members who are engaged and even the petitioner, as they noted in their letter, they did want to hear the feedback of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3398.453s">They</a>  did want to engage in good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3399.835s">They</a>  did want to do this the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3401.596s">So</a>  that is where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3404.057s">We</a>  have an intent and an approach, I think, to work together to find a site, if they want to continue looking in Medford, that meets community needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3413.139s">And</a>  I think that is what we ask of everyone who petitions for a special permit of any kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3419.18s">I</a>  also want to note that the zoning we have now does need to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3422.361s">We're</a>  working through that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3424.321s">This</a>  was a special permit process, so there still would have been a process to require. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3427.983s">They</a>  couldn't just come in and do it in a residential area, which I think is an important point to note. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3433.427s">We</a>  do have the planning director and council present. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3436.869s">I</a>  do want to invite Director Hunt up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3439.651s">to</a>  speak, and then I'm hoping we can refer this to the committee to come up with something. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3445.035s">I</a>  know that we got some legal advice around the specific structure of something like this, how it would need to be structured. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3451.519s">People</a>  with substance use disorders are a protected class, so we have to be very careful in the legal construction of anything around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3459.665s">Right</a>  now, if we were to institute something with the current zoning, we would ban any medical office from opening in the city of Medford whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3466.988s">So</a>  we really need to go through the diligent process to get this right and follow the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3471.329s">So</a>  that's what we will do. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3472.65s">And</a>  with that, I will go to the Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability, Alicia Hunt.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3481.252s">President</a>  Bears, I think that you, Alicia Hunt, Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability, I think you actually said everything <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3489.011s">that</a>  I was, uh, had prepared to share with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3493.154s">Um,</a>  there are a couple of just the points that I just want to make sure that everybody's aware of is that addiction is defined as a substance use disorder and is recognized as a disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3503.321s">And</a>  therefore we need to be careful about any civil rights violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3507.043s">And</a>  so we have to be very careful about how everything is framed, what people say, how it's, um, how it's handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3513.528s">I</a>  provided information to the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3516.338s">or</a>  to Councilor Bears, from the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3520.441s">Commission</a>  on Civil Rights or Statements on Substance Abuse and the ADA, which is a very difficult situation because having a disease is a protected class. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3534.671s">I</a>  did want to make sure that everybody from the public knows that all of the letters that were received by myself, by the planning office, and by the Zoning Board of Appeals <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3544.968s">were</a>  provided to the applicant. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3547.409s">So</a>  they do have, I thought about counting the numbers of letters, but there are a lot of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3553.15s">So</a>  all of those statements, all of that information has gone to them so that I didn't want anybody to think that there wasn't an opportunity to express that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3563.312s">When</a>  we talk about moratoriums, the legal advice is that they have to be time limited and tied to a significant impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3572.301s">and</a>  have a plan for resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3575.042s">Also</a>  this situation, this is a zoning special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3580.524s">Therefore</a>  the city council doesn't actually have the ability to just pass a moratorium in one meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3586.647s">For</a>  example, you could not vote tonight to pass a moratorium on medical office uses in Medford or substance abuse clinics and that take effect because it's a zoning issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3599.824s">Therefore,</a>  the proper language, as you started to say, has to be put in front of the City Council, which then has to refer it to the Community Development Board, who has to hold a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3611.474s">And</a>  the public hearing must be properly noticed for two weeks, and then they refer back their <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3618.041s">recommendation</a>  to the City Council, which must also hold a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3622.263s">So</a>  I just wanted people to be aware that there is not actually a legal option here to just pass something tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3629.005s">It</a>  would literally have to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3630.906s">I</a>  mean, you could pass a resolution that the City Council cannot issue a permit, but this permit is not in front of the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3640.589s">So</a>  I just wanted to be clear about the process and that it does take some time to be done correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3648.906s">And</a>  the other item that I wanted to mention is that the CD board and the zoning board both received the notice to withdraw. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3659.791s">So</a>  they intend to basically receive that and accept that withdrawal and not take public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3668.275s">I</a>  will say that the zoning board will be hybrid still because that is how it was advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3673.137s">So</a>  the intention is that the zoning board on Thursday night <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3676.905s">some</a>  of the staff and at least the chair, I don't know how many of the members will be here in the council chambers, and the option would be to come here in person or remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3686.989s">There</a>  are actually a large number of items on the agenda for Thursday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3691.331s">The</a>  CD board, in order for us to hold a proper hybrid meeting, we really actually, especially anything that's gonna have a large number of attendees, needs to use the city council chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3701.895s">So</a>  the city council chamber is not available Wednesday night for the community development board, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3706.138s">because</a>  the City Council is using it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3708.26s">So</a>  that meeting had intended to hold a room that would be available here in City Hall with staff for anybody who doesn't have access to Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3720.498s">to</a>  help them provide public comment, display the meeting on the large monitor, and have them be able to speak through that through staff, to speak on the meeting, but the staff would work the Zoom in the other, sorry, the other conference room. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3736.925s">So</a>  I just wanted that to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3739.666s">They</a>  can still provide that option, but the only items on the CD board meeting then without this is a, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3748.337s">very</a>  technical item called an approval not required and approval of minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3753.001s">So</a>  I don't want people to waste their times because I know people have very busy lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3757.045s">So</a>  I just wanted to put that information forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3760.348s">If</a>  there are any questions about <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3762.008s">the</a>  procedural matters, I am more than happy to answer procedural questions.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3765.99s">I</a>  just wanted to confirm what you just said for simplicity's sake. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3770.333s">The</a>  application has been withdrawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3771.734s">There's</a>  currently no application to consider this from this company anywhere in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3775.876s">It</a>  will be withdrawn at tomorrow night's City Community Development Board meeting, Thursday's Zoning Board of Appeals meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3782.32s">And</a>  as discussed in the letter and as discussed by Councilor Scarpelli, the intent of all parties is to have more discussions about as a city developing <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3792.146s">and</a>  looking at this in the zoning context and from the applicant working in good faith with the city and community members to find a site if they want to continue in Medford, that is not in a residential area.</p>

    <p>[Tomaszczuk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3802.852s">That</a>  is correct.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3803.712s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3804.613s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3806.614s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3807.914s">Thank</a>  you for putting this forward, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3809.595s">Thank</a>  you so much for the context, Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3811.956s">Thank</a>  you to so many people for joining us in the council chambers, as always. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3818.473s">I</a>  wouldn't wanna put words in Councilor Scarpelli's mouth, but when we're on the topic about how to proceed here procedurally, in the committee meeting directly before this one, in the planning and permitting committee, we were actually just discussing the issue of Salem Street Corridor as one of our zoning priorities as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3836.081s">So</a>  I think that this could be just a really cohesive move to refer this paper, which as we've been discussing needs a little bit more <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3844.687s">that</a>  it needs tweaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3845.548s">This</a>  is a zoning issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3847.769s">We've</a>  never done a zoning issue in one meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3849.91s">I</a>  think that that aligns very closely with the work that we were just discussing doing in the zoning committee, knowing that the rezoning of re-evaluating the zoning of Salem Street is already a priority for the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3862.158s">We</a>  were just speaking about that in the last committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3864.58s">And</a>  so I think it could be, I think it could dovetail really nicely with our existing plans to take a look at Salem Street Corridor in addition to some other priority corridors in the city and say, what does our zoning allow us to do here by right? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3877.964s">What</a>  does it allow us to do by a special permit, which until this permit was withdrawn, applied to this permit, what do we wanna see on these corridors and how should we update our zoning so that we get what we want and we don't have to worry about what we don't want <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3891.488s">here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3891.728s">And</a>  I do want to note, I've been hearing this, you know, over and over for the past couple weeks, and I'm really heartened to hear it from so many people in the community saying, it's not that I think we shouldn't have this in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3903.97s">It's</a>  just that the location has to be right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3905.65s">And</a>  I think that something I'm really certain we all share is that, you know, we know that this is something that people need. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3912.112s">This</a>  is a service that people need, that people in Medford need, that our neighbors need. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3916.172s">We</a>  want it to be successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3917.533s">And</a>  in order to be successful, it needs to be in the right location. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3920.553s">And</a>  I think that we can, I would love to prioritize this issue within our existing zoning work to make sure that as we're reevaluating our zoning already in progress, we're taking a look to say, where's the right spot for this use and how can we make sure that it can occur here and not in locations where it's going to be less successful and less supported by residents for understandable reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3943.758s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3945.66s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3945.9s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3947.001s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Lazzaro, but was there a motion to refer? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3950.043s">I</a>  couldn't quite tell.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3951.645s">I'd</a>  like to clear clarity with the Council, if I can, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3957.729s">I</a>  know we have the Council, we have a representative that the city had hired to work directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3965.575s">I</a>  just want to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3967.717s">I,</a>  what I put in as a motion is legally, um, you know, acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3973.461s">I</a>  don't want to put something in that's going to negatively affect that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3977.503s">I</a>  did invite the director and council up for specific questions to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3980.585s">So</a>  I will, we'll do that and then we'll go around and then we'll be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3983.427s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Mullen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3984.434s">Councilor,</a>  Mr. President, my name is Tom Mullen. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3987.816s">I've</a>  been retained as special counsel pending the determination of whether KP law, your city solicitor, uh, has, has a conflict or can continue, uh, with this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4002.406s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4003.815s">As</a>  we heard Councilor Scarpelli say, the focus here is going to be making sure that a dispensary of this type, if it goes into Medford, goes into the right place. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4016.841s">And</a>  that is going to be the focus of any amendments to the zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4023.704s">I</a>  would ask that you not, um, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4028.015s">attempt</a>  to deal with this with the blunt instrument of a moratorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4032.904s">I</a>  say that because there have been a number of cases in Massachusetts and in our First Circuit <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4041.092s">where</a>  cities and towns attempted to use a moratorium and they were struck down. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4049.034s">And</a>  losing a case like that means you lose a civil rights action, there are damages, you pay the other side's attorney's fees in addition to losing the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4060.916s">The</a>  right way to go about this, I think, is the way that the council has been tending this evening, which is to work on amending the zoning ordinance to make sure that dispensaries like this, which everybody agrees have a place, are in the right place, and to deal with the effects, the externalities, such as traffic and parking, that bother all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4088.959s">I</a>  hope that answers your question.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4090.52s">Point</a>  of information, President?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4091.681s">This</a>  is a question for Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4094.483s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4095.804s">Can</a>  we please use the words medical office instead of dispensary?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4109.214s">We're</a>  not going to do this tonight, y'all, so... <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4115.919s">All</a>  right, would you, we can stop right now if we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4120.442s">Please</a>  don't disrupt the public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4123.464s">Please</a>  don't disrupt the public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4125.506s">We</a>  have a good resolution here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4127.587s">And</a>  if you want, we can shut this down right now.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4129.869s">Mr.</a>  President, if we could just move forward and send this to the subcommittee in zoning and we stop the process as soon as we can.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4137.594s">We</a>  have a motion to refer to planning and permitting committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4140.416s">Is</a>  there any further questions or comment for council or for the planning director? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4148.0s">I</a>  don't think so.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4148.721s">No,</a>  I think we eliminate the moratorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4150.663s">I've</a>  taken that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4151.724s">I</a>  think that we restructure the motion to ask to refer this to the zoning, our subcommittee in zoning to draw up the legal and proper terminology to move this forward.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4164.576s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6427.782s">Charles</a>  Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6430.183s">I</a>  just wanted to mention the withdrawal letter from Habit. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6433.005s">I</a>  mentioned adversity as the reason for the withdrawal, which makes an ordinance for methadone even more important than ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6439.889s">Under</a>  our current zoning, this can open with minimal notification and no wide community notice anywhere with a simple permit for a medical facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6449.395s">An</a>  opioid dispensary can just open with virtually no one knowing until it's too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6453.597s">Only</a>  10 people were notified, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6455.759s">that</a>  a medical facility was gonna open at 360 Salem Street, and it's actually a methadone dispensary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6462.789s">While</a>  they've pulled the application, they can submit it and be on the agenda for the July meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6467.576s">So</a>  this isn't over, we need an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6473.837s">Medford</a>  needs a specific use on the use table for this methadone dispensary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6477.502s">The</a>  obvious limitations already exist in our pot ordinance, only in commercial two or industrial one zone, nowhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6485.212s">If</a>  we won't allow pot in our neighborhoods, then why would we allow opioid dispensaries? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6490.37s">You</a>  must move to change the zoning now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6492.351s">Otherwise,</a>  a for-profit company will look for the cheapest real estate, even in the middle of a residential area where it doesn't belong, and just seek to open with minimal notice as a medical facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6504.057s">They</a>  need not provide any medical attention or treatment, merely a pill dispensed from a for-profit vendor whose purpose is to file as many claims for as many doses as they can to make a larger profit without regard for the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6520.219s">Habit</a>  opened in Springfield on a street with two treatment centers in existence with no issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6525.383s">Suddenly</a>  there was open drug use, prostitution, drug dealers, and other crime that was described as an open air drug market. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6532.47s">The</a>  police chief increased patrols in the area and drove crime into the neighboring streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6538.12s">which</a>  here would all be residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6541.381s">Efforts</a>  by the city to reach Habit were ignored, and then the press moved on and left the neighbors to deal with the pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6548.283s">Habit</a>  has an opioid dispensary at Mass and Cass, and it too is an open air drug market. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6552.905s">The</a>  Globe and the Herald recently reported that the police attempting to stop the open drug use found that it just moved over a few blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6560.527s">and</a>  then moved back when they tried to disperse them from the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6564.13s">What</a>  impact will this have on any recovering addicts who live in our neighborhood and now have to be exposed to open drug use where they live? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6572.036s">And</a>  what impact on others living in the area or the dancing school or the nearby restaurant or the elementary school that has nearly 600 children? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6581.043s">The</a>  neighborhood has been fighting to be heard and is the only reason that we even know this project was on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6588.148s">10</a>  people were notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6589.63s">Multiple</a>  people have printed and delivered flyers, they have picketed, they have collected signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6594.775s">Under</a>  the current application, as only a medical facility, the city is not required to provide a community meeting as they would with a pot dispensary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6603.263s">This</a>  business that will harm entire neighborhoods and the current zoning allows them to only notify 10 people? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6610.328s">This</a>  is a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6611.689s">This</a>  is missing zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6613.37s">This</a>  should only be allowed in commercial 2 and industrial 1, just as a pot dispensary is limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6619.815s">A</a>  community meeting should also have been required. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6622.698s">Regular</a>  oversight should occur in order to keep that permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6626.622s">It</a>  should not be an easy process as it could potentially destroy a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6630.786s">No</a>  neighborhood should have to roll the dice and hope HABIT won't operate as they normally do to the extreme detriment of those around them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6637.893s">We</a>  need to be aware that this application will return. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6640.396s">They</a>  have already said they're coming to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6642.959s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6649.073s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6649.373s">Name</a>  and address for the record, you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Lemler]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6651.515s">Hi,</a>  I'm Joan Lemler. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6652.936s">I'm</a>  from 56 Farragut Avenue here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6656.079s">You</a>  all saw me rather late on, I believe it was the 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6660.662s">I'm</a>  really here to address the process going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6665.206s">There's</a>  an incredible opportunity here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6667.828s">The</a>  amount of energy and spirit that I've seen amongst all kinds of stakeholders in the last three weeks has been really impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6677.512s">and</a>  heartening. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6679.093s">And</a>  my question is, how do we mobilize this to really ensure that the I know it's the four R's, you know, I'm not going to go into that again, because you've all read about it, heard about it, and a lot of people talking about the four R's. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6694.463s">You</a>  know, I'm hearing that the provider, in this case, HabitO has withdrawn their application, but it still sounds like, you know, Cheryl was mentioning, they're still intending to partner with all the parties that be to pick another place. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6713.581s">Well,</a>  which groups work on really deciding right treatment, right time, right place, and right provider? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6721.973s">Has</a>  that already been decided? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6724.477s">You</a>  know, I know I had homework last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6726.74s">I</a>  think I was referred to the Department of Health here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6730.424s">I</a>  didn't call the director yet because I was a little busy with everybody else working real hard in the last few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6737.41s">And</a>  what I really, you know, I started looking at all the boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6742.775s">There's</a>  39 in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6744.616s">There's</a>  just a lot of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6746.918s">And</a>  I, you know, there's one for the health department, you know, there's also one for mental health and also one for disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6755.786s">And</a>  it, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6757.888s">It</a>  was kind of hard for me to figure out what these different groups were doing and what part they played, perhaps, in this whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6766.431s">So</a>  I went to their meetings and their minutes, and some of them, maybe they haven't been too active lately or they don't have enough members, but that one that deals with mental health and prevention, there's like a roster of 10 people or more, very talented people from all sorts of sectors. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6786.379s">Are</a>  they mobilized to really look at the issue of drug use, abuse and addiction? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6792.945s">There's</a>  so much, you know, so many resources here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6796.608s">How</a>  is this going to go forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6799.43s">I</a>  just have a question of where do we go from here? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6803.273s">Or</a>  is all the energy going to be poured into simply finding another place for this particular provider?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6811.283s">You</a>  have 30 seconds.</p>

    <p>[Lemler]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6812.384s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6813.405s">So</a>  I caution all the parties and just hope that we can mobilize our energy to really make the right decision and not just focus in on one particular provider, one particular type of program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6831.342s">And</a>  I pledge myself to work hard on it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6836.104s">Thank</a>  you, and just, I can answer some of your question if you want, in terms of procedurally next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6842.027s">So</a>  the council voted on the paper that had been proposed, and we'll be looking at the zoning element of this, which is within our purview, and what the state law allows us to do, what the legal cases allow us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6853.272s">In</a>  terms of, in general, prevention, health, addressing substance use disorder, and the opioid crisis, we do have the Office of Prevention and Outreach, which has done some really great work on that in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6865.878s">and</a>  they convened the Preserving Mental and Behavioral Health Commission, which we established three or so years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6872.987s">In</a>  terms of the rights of providers, right, I get the four R's, and I think it's important for the city to engage in looking at that, but the provider themselves as a corporate entity, non-profit or for-profit, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6885.802s">they</a>  do have a right to petition for zoning or to want to open a business or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6890.204s">So</a>  the city can't control them from coming and asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6893.426s">And</a>  then we have to follow the laws of the public process as laid out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6897.288s">So</a>  I think that's why you found, you know, that there's all this, you know, there was a special permit of the zoning board for this use in this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6905.071s">So</a>  that's the process that outlines there, what has to happen there, engaging those other bodies, you know, in a more holistic look at mental health and behavioral health. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6914.876s">That</a>  is the work of the Office of Prevention and Outreach, but they don't actually have approval or denial authority over special permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6921.585s">So</a>  that's why there's some mismatch there and why certain groups are engaged in certain elements of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6932.198s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Ciappelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6934.38s">Patricia</a>  Ciapelli, 53 Garfield Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6937.862s">As</a>  an abutter to the methadone dosing facility at the end of my street, I was never notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6943.807s">There's</a>  a reason why legal notices are to be sent certified mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6948.65s">Then</a>  imagine my surprise when I find out this firm is the same firm that has wreaked havoc in Lynn, Springfield, Lowell, and Boston, Mass and Cass, where people defecate and urinate in the streets, and the engagement center had to be closed because the employees were afraid to go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6963.973s">We</a>  have gathered hundreds of voters' signatures, hundreds, over the past few weeks against this facility coming to our neighborhood, and we will continue to gather more. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6975.056s">People</a>  from North Medford, West Medford, Brooks, Lawrence Estates area, when we asked them, why are you signing our petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6982.979s">This</a>  doesn't affect you or your neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6985.359s">They</a>  responded, it's Medford, and we've heard about this company. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6988.88s">We</a>  don't want them in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6991.448s">We</a>  already assist those afflicted with this horrible disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6994.87s">We</a>  have 10 locations within two miles of just downtown Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6999.974s">You</a>  recently asked for a 2.5% override for our taxes to fund the schools for additional programs because you care about our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7007.839s">Do</a>  you really? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7008.499s">Does</a>  putting a methadone dosing facility 0.2 miles from an elementary school speak to your care for the children? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7015.564s">Or</a>  is prostitution and walking through needles on the street to get to school a new program of education you are offering? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7022.289s">I</a>  can't believe you let Habit Opco be in charge of their own traffic study. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7027.033s">This</a>  is a horrible way to run the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7029.015s">We</a>  trust you to provide a checks and balances on how you produce your business and how you make your decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7036.381s">You</a>  are the equivalent of a publicly held company and we are your stakeholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7041.606s">You</a>  owe us the complete transparency on information and financing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7047.131s">Recently,</a>  the Administration for Children and Families, a division of Health and Human Services, recently held a human trafficking and the opioid crisis webinar conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7056.959s">Dr.</a>  Catherine Chong stated, there is an intersection where opioid users and human trafficking cross. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7064.585s">We</a>  have learned that human traffickers are increasingly recruiting in drug rehabilitation facilities and other similar programs because they see the vulnerability when someone is trying to recover from opioid or substance use. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7078.356s">They</a>  are also focusing on the parents that come to those facilities and exploit their children. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7085.202s">How</a>  do we know this would stop here, given the close proximity to any neighborhood or elementary school where they want to come back? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7093.171s">The</a>  Glenwood area has received your message loud and clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7096.033s">We</a>  are a racially, ethnically, and economically diverse neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7099.495s">It</a>  is clear you are blatantly discriminating against us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7102.977s">You</a>  may be the Our Revolution, but we are the Take Back Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7107.059s">Nice</a>  to meet you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7207.233s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7209.955s">I'm</a>  going to go to Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7211.716s">Marie</a>  Izzo, name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7213.997s">If</a>  someone could unmute Marie, for some reason I'm not a co-host right now.</p>

    <p>[Izzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7225.014s">Hey,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7226.095s">Hi,</a>  Marie Izzo, Pilgrim Road, Medford Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7231.179s">So</a>  like everyone else here, I understand they have withdrawn, but I do believe that there's an urgent need for treatment in Medford and in the rest of the United States for opioid addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7244.651s">To</a>  disallow any treatment modality is inappropriate and unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7249.355s">There's</a>  no one way to recover from addiction, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7252.516s">And</a>  it is a lifetime commitment, regardless of what modality is used. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7256.557s">There's</a>  been a lot of misinformation that has been spread related to the number of clinics already in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7262.079s">I</a>  heard five. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7263.159s">Now</a>  I've heard there are at least 10 locations within two miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7267.18s">I</a>  wonder why they would want to come to Medford if there are 10 locations of other methadone programs within two miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7274.105s">I</a>  was a regional manager involved in hiring of staff, and I can assure you, so I worked for Habit Management before it was purchased by Bain Capital and now Acadia Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7285.514s">So</a>  I was involved in hiring of staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7287.456s">I</a>  can assure you that I hired fine doctors, nurses, and clinicians, and I was very proud of staff and clients. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7294.482s">I'm</a>  deeply disturbed by how these clinics have been referred to as dispensaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7298.926s">They</a>  are absolutely not dispensaries only. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7302.269s">In</a>  fact, all methadone programs, profit or nonprofit, make 99% of their income from counseling by licensed mental health clinicians, social workers, and certified addiction staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7313.363s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7314.204s">I</a>  also want to mention that the mass and caste problem <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7317.708s">has</a>  nothing to do with habit management. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7320.81s">That</a>  has to do with victory programs that were closed many years ago by Marty Walsh, and that victory programs involved substance abuse and mostly unhoused. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7333.158s">And</a>  when given the fact that we do have a housing crisis, and these are not people necessarily that are getting treatment because you can't get treatment and show up that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7344.827s">You</a>  can be homeless, but you have to be in pretty good shape before anyone is going to give you any dose of any medication. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7351.913s">So</a>  this is a housing issue at Mass and Cas and has nothing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7356.937s">So</a>  there is a methadone program at Boston Medical Center, which may or may not have contributed to that, but mostly that is a homeless population and people with serious, serious mental health issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7368.52s">And</a>  I'm sorry to say that we have plenty of people in Medford that would need some intervention with both in the area of recovery and mental health. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7378.682s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7379.123s">All</a>  right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7385.592s">Go</a>  to the podium, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7387.494s">This</a>  is Wally Nuzzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7388.535s">I</a>  live on Parris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7390.116s">I'm</a>  ultra proud to be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7391.517s">I</a>  hate public speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7393.879s">I</a>  just wanted to mention something that the last person said. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7397.182s">This</a>  is not a clinic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7399.885s">This</a>  company only opens medical distribution centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7405.53s">There's</a>  no treatment that's going to be happening there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7408.311s">Other</a>  than that, the fact that this company pulled their request today as a construction professional, I can tell you, they can apply again tomorrow for the same space with the same listings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7421.287s">And</a>  I had to close in a porch and I had to let <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7425.848s">people</a>  within 400 feet of a residential dwelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7428.99s">No,</a>  it's pathetic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7430.611s">The</a>  amount of people that were not mentioned here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7433.913s">And</a>  also it was pathetic that for every other motion, this, this council body open the floor for public speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7441.738s">And</a>  on the one thing that three quarters of the people that were in this room came to say, you skipped over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7447.441s">It's</a>  a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7448.582s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7454.929s">Name</a>  is Zoom, Jess H. And I will note that if there is a reapplication, it would have to follow the public process and there would be a special permit process with the Zoning Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7467.492s">Jess,</a>  you have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7468.572s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Healey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7471.892s">Jessica</a>  Healy, Four Lock Road, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7476.013s">I</a>  just wanna talk about the, it is a methadone clinic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7479.494s">It</a>  is a dispensary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7481.814s">Someone</a>  who is, I am on, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7485.33s">Matt,</a>  but there's a big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7489.152s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7489.732s">No</a>  one has brought up is the suboxone clinics. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7493.734s">They're</a>  a lot different than methadone clinics, methadone clinics. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7499.096s">Um,</a>  a lot of people go there and dose in the morning because they're sick and then their drug dealers will meet them at the methadone clinic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7509.941s">They</a>  do not offer a lot of treatment at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7514.448s">It's</a>  mostly just dosing and leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7517.57s">You</a>  have to get 15 minutes a month of therapy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7523.113s">So</a>  it is a detrimental place to have near a school, near a dance, near residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7535.641s">I</a>  just want to know, has anyone, you know, you want to help people <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7541.946s">with</a>  opioid issues, which I understand completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7545.147s">I'm</a>  on the program, but Suboxone is a lot different. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7549.949s">It</a>  is, people come, they get their prescription, they leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7553.731s">They</a>  can come every week, every two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7556.712s">Methadone</a>  is a daily dosing place. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7558.813s">And</a>  that's what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7560.133s">It's</a>  not a medical center or whatever you wanna call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7566.296s">So</a>  I'm wondering who I could reach out to, to talk more about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7572.153s">issue.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7573.253s">I</a>  think if you really want to put a methadone clinic in Medford, over on Mystic Valley Parkway, there's the old Gold's Gym right near the courthouse and the state police. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7586.118s">That</a>  might be a better option. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7590.019s">But</a>  I have to disagree with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7592.34s">Izzo.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7593.3s">Methadone</a>  clinics are notorious for drug dealers showing up because they know people are just dosing in the morning <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7601.26s">to</a>  get through so they can meet them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7604.541s">So</a>  is there someone that I could reach out to regarding this?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7611.342s">The</a>  Office of Prevention and Outreach does work on this and the health department. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7616.524s">And</a>  in terms of the application, the city did not solicit this private business to apply for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7621.285s">They</a>  decided to apply for it.</p>

    <p>[Healey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7625.946s">So</a>  who would okay it though? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7627.266s">Like</a>  if they come back and say, listen, we wanna find another place in Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7632.401s">Who</a>  would have to pay that right now?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7635.602s">It's</a>  based on the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7637.002s">If</a>  they wanted to go back to the site, if they were, for example, to reapply, the zoning board of appeals would approve a special permit for this use in that district.</p>

    <p>[Healey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7645.565s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7646.545s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7646.926s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Uzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7653.048s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7655.117s">Hi,</a>  my name's Jean Uzo, I live on Paris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7657.398s">I'll</a>  try to keep my comments brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7659.519s">In</a>  this moment, there are many points I could make about the opioid crisis, the applicant, our floor treatment approaches, the challenges that those with addictions face daily and how they're intensified in the early stages of recovery, and how at risk these folks are from predatory bad actors. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7675.868s">I</a>  could speak about Glenwood, its diversity, culture, socioeconomic, and otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7681.511s">how</a>  negatively transformative this type of application could be to us, our elderly and at risk, our small businesses, and most importantly, our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7691.795s">But</a>  I'd like to take a moment and celebrate the unity of our community that we have felt in this past week and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7697.816s">I've</a>  seen a coalescing in our Glenwood neighborhood and across the city that I haven't seen in a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7705.019s">Regardless</a>  of station, cultural affiliation, or party if you have one, hundreds have stepped forward in support of Glenwood, in support of good treatment options, and changing the way we talk about those struggling with addiction and those seeking recovery. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7718.385s">And</a>  most importantly, in support of working together for the benefit of the community at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7723.917s">So,</a>  so far in the week we've collected about 550 signatures on our free petition and voter registration is working to diligently advise us as to how many of those are registered voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7736.374s">The</a>  circulating petition is asking you all, elected and appointed officials, department heads, boards and commissions, and the administration, to join together with the community stakeholders and subject matter experts to have this very necessary hard conversation about this deeply important matter and codify a methadone zoning ordinance that will not leave location, proximity, operating requirements, and so much more to chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7762.882s">and</a>  ordinance that will mitigate the guesswork of applicants, alleviate the level of stress that comes with uncertainty for residents, and assure that no other neighborhood has to go through what we are experiencing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7775.085s">As</a>  a community, and in our zoning laws for years, we've said we think it's important to outline our expectations around where and where not liquor could be sold. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7783.027s">and</a>  more recently served. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7784.628s">We've</a>  also determined that due to the complex requirements around cannabis, that they rise to the level of having their own ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7791.853s">The</a>  signatories on the aforementioned petition, and perhaps others, believe that we should be just as purposeful with the controlled substance such as those that come with medically assisted treatment programs, a.k.a. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7803.922s">methadone</a>  dispensaries or clinics if you so choose.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8535.658s">Mr.</a>  Jones, I would just note, Mr. Jones, the application was withdrawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8540.723s">I</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8541.363s">So</a>  I'm just going to speak now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8543.325s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8544.186s">So</a>  the application was withdrawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8546.708s">The</a>  council's not the special permit granting authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8549.531s">It's</a>  not our role under the state chapter 40 a zoning law for us to insert ourselves in the special permit process of another special permit granting authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8557.235s">And</a>  I think you heard from all of the city staff involved from many counselors that we wanted and from the proponent from everyone here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8566.188s">And</a>  people have emailed me. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8567.549s">If</a>  you got an email back from me, I think you'll know what I said in the email back. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8571.372s">I</a>  said, I don't think this is the right place, and I don't think this is the right process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8575.295s">The</a>  right location, or the right place as being in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8578.878s">The</a>  right location. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8580.379s">Most</a>  of the responses have said, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8582.541s">We</a>  believe that this has a place in the spectrum of treatment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8585.904s">We'd</a>  like to see it in a commercial industrial district. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8588.586s">I</a>  think you would find that basically everyone who acted and was involved in this process from the city side, whether that's the planning office, representatives from the health department, members of the city council, we worked to play our role as best as we could to have the public comment heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8604.398s">And</a>  the result was that the applicant said, we heard this isn't gonna work here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8609.096s">and</a>  we're withdrawing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8610.377s">So</a>  the result is it's not coming, the application is not applied, and now we wanna come and work with all parties involved to put this in a place where people feel comfortable that it should be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8620.103s">So</a>  that was what happened, that was the result, and I think that's being lost a little bit in this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8626.388s">So</a>  I just wanted to state that when we talk about what roles different people played in the process here.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8630.69s">I</a>  understand the procedural elements that you just spoke about. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8633.813s">It's</a>  over for tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8635.634s">It</a>  will be back. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8636.855s">I</a>  would like to see us together <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8639.896s">get</a>  what the city wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8640.837s">This</a>  is straight up a replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8642.518s">This</a>  is not treatment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8643.838s">This</a>  is not gonna help them get better. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8645.779s">It's</a>  giving a replacement for the drugs that they are seeking. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8648.641s">It's</a>  gonna be a magnet for all these type of individuals that are sick, they need treatment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8653.743s">They</a>  just don't need a handout of the drugs that they're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8656.605s">And</a>  I'd love to work together on this to keep this facility out of the city.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8661.587s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8661.947s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8662.468s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8665.869s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Santiago]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8667.589s">Diana</a>  Santiago, 19 Paris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8669.631s">I</a>  just wanted to let you guys know that I did get some text messages tonight from people who wanted to join on Zoom and they were unable to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8677.776s">So</a>  you do have other residents out there who are trying to get access. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8682.039s">I</a>  am one of the butters on 19 Paris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8684.721s">I'm</a>  also one of my past jobs was a social worker. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8687.663s">So</a>  I do understand the need for the treatment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8689.624s">Again,</a>  I think we've talked a lot about the right location, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8693.667s">I</a>  think there's an opportunity here, and I will admit my understanding of all the offices may not be as clear as others, but it sounds like it might be some hard work, but some worthwhile work to try to figure out how to tighten our zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8708.356s">I</a>  know out in Springfield, the quote from their director of their housing board was that they felt that the application of HOPCO out there came in under the radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8720.302s">there</a>  was not a lot of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8721.903s">As</a>  the person who never got the postcard from that, there was not a lot of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8726.786s">I</a>  think there's an opportunity to see that maybe we need to be collecting more information as a city for when people are petitioning to bring businesses in, and I mean all businesses, so that you can really get a good, firm idea of what's coming in and where it is and is it in the appropriate zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8747.375s">It's</a>  an opportunity to come together and really tighten up everything, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8753.759s">So</a>  hopefully you guys will not shy away from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8757.381s">I</a>  did want to comment also on tonight's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8760.442s">I</a>  know you <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8762.694s">we</a>  went on and we didn't get a chance to speak and you were following the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8766.335s">As</a>  someone who hasn't attended this regularly, I was sitting back there and I couldn't understand what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8770.957s">It</a>  was like you just skipped over it and it was like a slap in the face. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8774.198s">Then,</a>  sir, you did explain it and thank you for explaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8776.299s">I</a>  understand now that it was not a slap in my face, that there were certain rules, but I think it would have been helpful if you explained what those rules are for some of us newbies who didn't understand what was going on.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8786.883s">Thank</a>  you, I appreciate the comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8796.104s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Laidlaw]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8798.485s">You</a>  have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8800.586s">First</a>  of all, I apologize for getting here late. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8802.247s">I</a>  was at softball. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8803.648s">I</a>  wasn't gonna come because I knew it got withdrawn, but as I'm sitting home watching the Zoom meeting, I'm absolutely infuriated for a couple of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8812.013s">So</a>  yes, we do know that they can withdraw it, which I'm happy that they withdrew it, especially from the area that it was put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8818.516s">As</a>  we all know, I am very vocal about addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8820.678s">I</a>  am one of those junkie addicts who was on methadone for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8823.98s">I</a>  got off successfully and have remained clean and sober for 19 years of sobriety with nothing in my bag. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8830.282s">So</a>  it does work. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8832.985s">It's</a>  just a handout. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8834.606s">And</a>  I know we didn't mean anything by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8836.068s">And</a>  I love the person who was just speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8838.069s">But</a>  this is the reason why I was embarrassed to tell people I was on methadone for those two years at first, because people don't understand methadone. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8845.696s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8846.377s">But</a>  places like have it off though, are a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8849.62s">Okay,</a>  and I'm going to tell you that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8851.241s">That</a>  is not the facility that we would want in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8854.262s">And</a>  I'm going to tell you why. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8855.482s">Kappadoko</a>  also care about his numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8857.383s">I</a>  go down Massacasse Boulevard, that lady who spoke completely lied. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8861.045s">I'm</a>  down there talking with those addicts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8862.485s">Those</a>  addicts, half of them are still my friends, because I will never turn my back on an addict out there still suffering. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8867.087s">I</a>  am not above anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8868.388s">None</a>  of us are in this world. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8870.428s">So</a>  with that being said. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8874.304s">I</a>  take pitches weekly because I go down there three times a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8877.145s">My</a>  daughter, as we know, is softball. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8878.986s">She</a>  goes to a program that's two blocks away from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8881.927s">They're</a>  calling it a dispensary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8883.568s">It's</a>  a dosing window. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8885.208s">That's</a>  what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8886.369s">And</a>  what a dosing window is, someone's going to go in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8888.87s">If</a>  they're too high, they're going to get refused their medication. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8891.131s">What's</a>  going to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8891.791s">A</a>  fight's going to break out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8892.931s">Then</a>  you want to admit the police department is going to have to step involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8895.452s">Mind</a>  you, they got no contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8897.213s">The</a>  funding, I don't care how much money they're going to offer the city, no amount of money is going to be worth what it's going to do to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8903.26s">Like</a>  I said, you want to put it somewhere, put it at LMH and make sure it's a program like a Bayquote or a Cambridge Health Alliance facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8910.069s">Somewhere</a>  that has a good reputation, a good background, and actually is there with people to get treatment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8915.515s">All</a>  they're doing is they're dosing and sending them out their way. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8917.836s">Dosing</a>  and sending them out their way. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8918.996s">So</a>  yeah, they are coughing dope down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8921.317s">Yeah,</a>  they are sticking needles. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8922.377s">You're</a>  going to find needles everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8924.218s">And</a>  I'm sorry, I will never be okay with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8926.018s">Because</a>  what I will do as the person that I am, and I will stand in front of you, whoever approves this, I will take all of that garbage and all those tents and I will throw them on their front lawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8935.321s">And</a>  I can promise you that, because it's unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8938.402s">We</a>  are the taxpayers in this city, and we should be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8941.103s">And</a>  when something is so outrageous, as some people say, oh, it's a wonderful idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8946.165s">Those</a>  people who are speaking who have degrees, I really don't care, because their opinion means nothing to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8951.288s">I</a>  don't want to talk to them for 30 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8952.688s">Well,</a>  that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8954.249s">My</a>  30 seconds count too, Zach. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8955.709s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8956.89s">I</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8957.33s">I</a>  just wanted to let you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8958.291s">I</a>  just wanted to let you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8959.631s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8960.852s">But</a>  it's just something that I sit here, and I listen to people who have, like, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8964.471s">counseling</a>  degrees, and this degree, I have a counseling degree too. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8967.412s">But</a>  unless you've walked in the shoes of an addict and you've been there doing outreach on a daily basis, you have no idea what it entails for the city and it'll be a dumpster fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8975.854s">And</a>  that's all I'm gonna say.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8977.694s">Thank</a>  you, Carrie. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8985.776s">Any</a>  further public comment on the matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8988.877s">Seeing</a>  no hands on Zoom and no one at the line in the chambers of the podium, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8996.902s">It's</a>  public participation so can make motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9001.992s">I</a>  mean, if you want to.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9004.219s">I</a>  just wanted to bolster, you know, you had mentioned that I think it's really important to say that we shouldn't mistake caution for support. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9012.587s">You</a>  know, I think a number of us on the city council have been really cautious with what we've said in the last two weeks because of what our legal counsel and because what our policy experts have advised us to be careful to say in a public forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9025.779s">But</a>  I have, you know, encouraged folks to, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9028.939s">make</a>  phone calls to me to discuss this issue, because I think that you'd be surprised to find that I see this issue very similarly as a lot of you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9039.289s">I</a>  came in planning to support, and I did, you know, by a 6-1 vote, we did pass Councilor Scarpelli's resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9047.497s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Berrios' comment that this wasn't the best location for this project and it wasn't the best process for the project, and I appreciate that Councilor Scarpelli put forward a resolution to help us reform the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9063.479s">There's</a>  been a lot said about the notifications and the transparency and the outreach of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9071.101s">I</a>  spent hours on phone calls last week with city staff, including with the director of planning, who promised soon a better outreach and transparency process, particularly involving the city council, so we can help get out the word better too. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9087.064s">Something</a>  that we are meeting tomorrow night in resident services, the resident services committee is creating a user guide for city council to make our rules clearer and more accessible, especially if this is your first time coming to a city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9100.451s">So</a>  those are just some points I wanted to bring up just to clarify and to bolster. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9105.314s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9108.555s">Name</a>  and address for the record please, you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Wallace]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9305.982s">You</a>  can be done here.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9313.206s">You</a>  have no clue why this person isn't here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9315.827s">You</a>  have no idea what, Steve, can we have a conversation? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9319.988s">Okay,</a>  can you stop interrupting me? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9321.969s">Please</a>  stop interrupting me. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9323.95s">I</a>  want to note to you that you have no idea why this counselor is not present, and maybe they had a major personal issue in their life today and are still showing up at this meeting, and I'd like you to give them a little grace.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9333.693s">It's</a>  not constant. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9341.713s">What?</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9343.735s">Thanks,</a>  Steve. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9344.616s">We'll</a>  see about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9347.219s">All</a>  right, Steve. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9351.103s">Please</a>  direct your comments to the chair and please avoid your personal diatribes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9354.626s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9356.26s">So</a>  anyways, as I was saying, I find that to be offensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9359.462s">The</a>  next thing I wanted to talk about is it seems like in this whole process that the city council has seemed to attack the residents, anyone that opposed this project, they tried to characterize them as against people that are suffering from addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9376.432s">So</a>  I wanted to start by saying the organization that I work <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9379.674s">With,</a>  we have four full-time drug and alcohol counselors that also deal with mental health that work seven days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9387.981s">They're</a>  on call 24-7. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9389.843s">And</a>  when one of our members has a crisis, they go right to their house, pick them up, drop them off at a treatment center. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9396.428s">So</a>  I just want to say that up front, as I am also opposed to this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9403.316s">But</a>  another thing about that, so I'm aware that the city doesn't have a drug and alcohol counselor, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9413.462s">so</a>  you're not gonna answer the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9414.742s">Well,</a>  they don't.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9415.623s">In</a>  cities like- That's not true, we do have a- Oh, you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9417.863s">We</a>  have a social team, yeah, thank you.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9418.903s">You</a>  have a certified drug and alcohol counselor that works for the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9421.484s">Please</a>  continue your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9422.464s">The</a>  answer's no, but cities like Malden do have full-time employees on their city staff that deal with those issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9429.946s">So</a>  about four weeks ago, the city created a new position of assistant DPW director, which the DPW workers have no idea why that person was hired, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9441.169s">what</a>  the purpose of the job is, so maybe you could use the funds a little better. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9445.85s">And</a>  my last point is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9447.711s">So</a>  through this meeting, and I was at the previous meeting, I've heard you say, Zach, and I'll paraphrase, you said something along the lines of, we had nothing to do with this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9458.514s">I</a>  heard Mr. Tseng say, don't take our silence for we were supportive. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9464.636s">But</a>  I would ask, why did none of the city councilors <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9468.377s">speak</a>  out against this project, except for Mr. Scarpelli, when it's right next to or right near a bike shop, an elementary school, a karate studio, a dance studio, restaurants, a residential area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9484.364s">And</a>  I think Mr. Singh alluded to the fact that maybe you were told by legal counsel to not comment, but clearly that's a silly comment.</p>

    <p>[Zarther]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9495.429s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9496.11s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9500.646s">Yeah,</a>  I would once again note that given the Chapter 48 zoning process and that the Zoning Board of Appeals is a special permit-granting authority, it is generally not recommended for the Council to insert politics into situations or to be serving as political actors in permitting processes because it opens the cities up to liability and lawsuit. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9521.818s">Would</a>  you like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9524.12s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9525.14s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Andrus]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9527.711s">My</a>  name is Martha Andrus. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9529.673s">I</a>  live at 45 Kilgore Avenue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9533.838s">I</a>  was about to go to bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9534.96s">I</a>  was watching this on TV and I felt I had to come down here and say something because I was hearing people with addiction referred to in vile terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9549.756s">I</a>  hope that Medford, whatever the regulatory and governance issues are, hope that Medford can provide more and better facilities for people with addiction to get treatment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9563.782s">I</a>  myself have lost a nephew to overdose. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9569.504s">My</a>  son's best friend died of an overdose leaving a four-year-old son. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9578.456s">I</a>  have lost, I'm not gonna start counting the people we've lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9583.898s">This</a>  is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9586.358s">This</a>  is human. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9588.879s">Jesus</a>  Christ said, even as you do it unto the least of these, you do it unto me. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9598.702s">If</a>  people have any interest in what Jesus Christ said, they might wanna think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9604.984s">I</a>  hope that either through this body <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9608.948s">or</a>  some other process, we are able to get facilities such as a methadone dispensary or whatever you want to call it, a place people can get treatment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9621.617s">And</a>  that is part of the treatment that's available. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9624.159s">It's</a>  not perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9626.68s">It's</a>  a whole lot better than leaving people to die. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9631.444s">And</a>  I just ask that people look into their hearts and try to find, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9638.868s">for</a>  those people who need this treatment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9640.949s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9660.78s">Thank</a>  you, President Beas. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9661.941s">I</a>  want to thank everybody who spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9669.366s">I</a>  think that this is, you know, with any issue that we don't have consensus on, you know, lately, it seems like it's pretty easy for things to get polarized. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9683.717s">When</a>  I listen to almost, not everybody, but almost everybody who's spoken on this issue at this meeting or who's emailed or called me or spoke at our last meeting, when I listen to almost all of those comments without any exception, I really do think that we all want the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9699.997s">I've</a>  heard <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9701.735s">Very,</a>  very few number of people say, I actually don't want this anywhere in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9705.336s">I</a>  think this has no place in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9706.916s">I've</a>  heard a very few number of people say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9709.577s">I</a>  personally don't believe that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9710.998s">I</a>  think this has a place in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9712.778s">That</a>  doesn't mean it should go any place in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9715.699s">I</a>  agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9716.679s">The</a>  success of the mission depends on where we put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9719.54s">And</a>  I think everybody who's come forward and said, I'm really concerned about where this was proposed to go, that's totally reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9728.143s">If</a>  anybody's felt vilified for having that opinion, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9732.526s">I</a>  would never want anybody to feel that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9735.208s">I</a>  don't think that you should be made to feel bad for voicing your opinion about where this should go or where it's going to be most successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9742.132s">I</a>  know some people are motivated by their neighborhood concerns and other people are motivated by, I don't think this is gonna be most successful here, this doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9750.018s">If</a>  this should go in a commercial or industrial area, why don't we have the tools currently in place to put it there? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9757.136s">That's</a>  actually under the jurisdiction of this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9759.617s">That's</a>  what we have the power to do we've been working for a very long time, more terms that I've been on the council to get to a point where we have the resources to make those changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9767.899s">When</a>  it comes to medical offices when it comes to many other uses so we can start finally start making decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9773.641s">That</a>  could be answers to the question of why don't we have X here? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9777.584s">Why</a>  don't we have Y here? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9779.346s">Why</a>  doesn't Medford look more like XYZ the way I want it to, the way it used to? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9783.629s">We're</a>  finally amassing the resources to make those changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9788.693s">They're</a>  not fast to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9790.214s">We</a>  can't make them quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9791.915s">It's</a>  too technical. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9792.756s">It's</a>  too detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9793.597s">That's</a>  a very unglamorous, but I think well-known thing about government is if you do it fast, you might do it wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9799.061s">And</a>  this is too important to not get right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9804.551s">But</a>  I just want to reinforce that when I hear people talk about this, I really think that we all, with some very, very few exceptions, we know that this has a place in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9813.253s">We</a>  know that we want to take excellent care of the people whose lives will be better off for having this available. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9819.955s">We</a>  know that there are people in Medford who do need this available. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9823.476s">We</a>  know that we should find the best possible place for this to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9826.857s">I</a>  don't think that this shared cause is advanced by <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9832.439s">using</a>  this forum to spread disinformation, such as there being a backroom deal to bring this into or to target a residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9840.325s">Of</a>  course that didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9842.026s">That</a>  would never happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9844.188s">That's</a>  nobody's goals here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9845.309s">I</a>  don't think this conversation is advanced by being resolute to be at war over this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9852.074s">We're</a>  all on the same team here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9853.916s">If</a>  we want to be at war about this, if people in this room or people in this conversation are resolved to be at war about this, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9860.595s">we</a>  can drag this congregation down into the mud. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9863.339s">That's</a>  optional. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9864.5s">And</a>  I think that's completely, completely orthogonal to everybody's goals here.</p>

    <p>[Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10991.836s">So</a>  thank you again for making the time to speak with us about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10996.54s">Just</a>  to clarify, I just want to do a very brief overview of how we got to this number. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11001.905s">CPA</a>  revenue is raised through a property tax surcharge. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11006.728s">It's</a>  a surcharge on top of taxes that are paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11009.251s">This</a>  is a pretty hard, fast number that we can easily calculate based upon assessment values and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11016.216s">So</a>  the base amount here, which math, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11020.578s">about</a>  1.8 I believe was the surcharge amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11024.78s">So</a>  that is our base. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11025.7s">On</a>  top of that, the state does provide a CPA match money that comes to us every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11031.142s">That</a>  money does come from the registry of deeds transactions a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11035.694s">gets</a>  skimmed off the top there and gets put into the state match money that comes to us as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11042.98s">So</a>  this year, the state match amount was only 14 and a half percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11046.864s">We</a>  have been benefiting from some really heavy transactions at the registry of deeds over COVID here, the pandemic, people were buying houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11054.931s">So</a>  there was more revenue to come into the CPA coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11059.074s">So</a>  just to explain to where we came to this $2,068,920, it is a combination of the surcharge raised locally, as well as that 14.4% state match that is estimated from the registry of dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11077.679s">I</a>  will want to point out that we made a, again, each of the three categories, open space, historic preservation, and affordable housing by state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11088.171s">We</a>  must spend a minimum of 10% or allocate 10% of our budget towards these projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11094.659s">You</a>  will notice that in affordable housing, that is a slightly higher number than the other two categories of open space and historic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11101.185s">That</a>  is because the committee elected to increase voluntarily our allocation for housing to 15% to explain the differences in costs there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11112.174s">As</a>  well, I just wanted to also point out the administrative bucket that is in here, that is for costs associated with executing the grant program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11120.197s">Pays</a>  my salary, it pays any other costs, our consulting fees, what have you, in order to support this program here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11131.041s">And</a>  I'm happy to answer any questions.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11133.302s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11134.562s">Any</a>  questions regarding the base allocation for CPC funds for <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11140.501s">fiscal</a>  25. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11141.101s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11144.283s">Thank</a>  you, President Burris. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11145.343s">Thank</a>  you so much for being here and sticking with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11148.164s">I</a>  don't have any specific questions on the appropriation requested, but I do always appreciate an overview of where CPA funding comes from, the very strict rules regulating what it may be spent on and in what proportion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11161.59s">I'm</a>  glad to see that the CPC voted to increase voluntarily the amount that we're spending on community housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11166.992s">I</a>  think that that's a value that's shared by many in the community, and I'm sure that'll be welcome news to many. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11171.457s">So</a>  of course, all of the uses that CPA money can be spent on are, you know, we can look all around and see the benefit that they do throughout Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11179.706s">So</a>  thank you so much for walking us through this, but I'm excited to approve this tonight.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11184.701s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11186.322s">Thank</a>  you, and I appreciate all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11188.002s">I</a>  think that when we are committed to support the CPA, I think that there's some clarity maybe you can help with. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11194.424s">I</a>  know that when we first voted for this, it was a matching number by the state, correct, at the time?</p>

    <p>[Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11202.168s">And</a>  it still is.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11202.989s">It</a>  still is. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11203.59s">Have</a>  we seen that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11204.551s">Are</a>  we getting that money? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11205.753s">We</a>  receive it every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11207.034s">Every</a>  year? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11207.455s">And</a>  how much is that?</p>

    <p>[Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11208.676s">It</a>  varies per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11209.777s">Again,</a>  as I explained, it's based off of the transactions that happen at the registry of these across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11217.968s">So</a>  that amount, as you can guess, is kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11221.417s">an</a>  estimate, but so every year it changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11224.878s">It's,</a>  it's been as high as I believe 41 and a half ish percent in 2021, but this year there, the DOR provided us with that strong advice to estimate low. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11237.803s">So</a>  that 14 and a 14.4% actually came directly from DOR.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11242.785s">So</a>  it's 14% this year.</p>

    <p>[Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11244.705s">That</a>  is what they're advising for all CPA communities to estimate this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11248.226s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11249.227s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11251.394s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11251.994s">Any</a>  council member?</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11254.315s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11254.556s">I</a>  would just like to thank you for figures two and three, which very clearly show the amount that has been matched by the state every year since 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11263.88s">Um,</a>  as well as figure three, which very clearly shows that historically they're 29% of CPA funds have gone towards affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11274.165s">I</a>  would recommend modestly that maybe the color coding is could be updated because we get these in</p>

    <p>[Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11280.488s">I'm</a>  sure it looked beautiful when it was colored.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11283.09s">It</a>  looks beautiful in the PDF. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11284.491s">It</a>  looks absolutely wonderful, very clear in the online PDF. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11288.453s">But</a>  I will say that just in the printed version, it's not quite clear that the state matching has been very consistent year to year, in spite of what has often been said in these chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11300.62s">So</a>  thank you very much for that.</p>

    <p>[Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11302.921s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11304.382s">I</a>  try to be sensitive to visual impairments. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11306.824s">So</a>  that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11307.804s">Thank</a>  you for pointing that out.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11309.039s">Well,</a>  if you can get us a color printer in the clerk's office, that would be a start.</p>

    <p>[Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11313.561s">Okay,</a>  I'll work on that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11315.681s">No,</a>  not your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11317.282s">That</a>  was a message for the ether and for others in the room like our chief of staff and our finance director. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11325.165s">I</a>  just wanted to note one other thing about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11327.986s">I</a>  believe we can find this copy of this plan on the CPC page on the city website or on the Preserve Medford page or both.</p>

    <p>[Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11337.3s">It</a>  is on the preserve Medford page, however, I believe that you're pointing out that it should be uploaded to the website and I will rectify that tomorrow morning.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11344.404s">No,</a>  no, it wasn't my, I didn't know if it was or wasn't.</p>

    <p>[Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11347.286s">It</a>  should be out there.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11348.327s">It's</a>  also available, I believe in color on the city council's agenda and meeting minutes portal. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11353.77s">If</a>  you were to go to the agenda, the item files for 24417, you can find a copy of that PDF there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11363.797s">Chair</a>  Cameron.</p>

    <p>[Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11365.353s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11366.334s">I</a>  want to commend to everyone, Teresa's presentation of the budget and everyone's understanding of the CPA budget and the rules that go into creating the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11377.54s">There</a>  was just one point of clarification that I thought might be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11381.362s">And</a>  that is that while the CPC has to dedicate a minimum of 10% to each program area each year, and we elected to increase our minimum to 15% for affordable housing, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11394.189s">the</a>  remaining 60% of our budget that is in the general reserve can be used in any of those three program areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11404.573s">And</a>  we've established an unwritten goal throughout the history of the CPA program to try to keep the spending about even between the three program areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11417.278s">And</a>  that's reflected in the numbers in the pie chart that's in the table that's in the report that you see. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11423.393s">We've</a>  spent about a third of the funding in each of the three program areas historically and in last year specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11432.035s">And</a>  that really critical community projects are elevated in that report that have been completed over the history of the program in each of the three program areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11445.459s">We've</a>  spent in the last six years, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11449.068s">approximately</a>  $12 million on projects to improve the city of Medford, including about 95 projects, open space, recreation parks across the city, major housing development projects, emergency rental assistance to make sure that landlords can get paid when renters have a surprising loss of income due to COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11475.886s">and</a>  historic preservation projects that are enabling transformative impacts in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11481.29s">So</a>  I really encourage everyone to read that report on what the CPA program has been doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11488.096s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11489.757s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11490.197s">And</a>  congratulations, trustee Cameron. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11495.461s">Thank</a>  you for volunteering for another role.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11723.804s">Then</a>  I think you need to click play from start. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11735.728s">If</a>  you scroll up a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11738.063s">You</a>  might have to scroll back. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11739.024s">If</a>  you might have to go down, bring your cursor down and then scroll up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11742.366s">I</a>  don't know why it's not showing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11758.076s">Justin,</a>  Matt. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11760.778s">We're</a>  sending Gen Z. We're sending Gen Z out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11764.52s">Although</a>  technically, apparently millennials are better at computers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11766.822s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11768.41s">all</a>  that time on the smartphones.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11771.412s">There</a>  we go, perfect.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11772.473s">Thank</a>  you, Justin.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11773.073s">Thank</a>  you for the invaluable technical support here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11778.397s">Okay,</a>  so I'm here to talk about a proposed South Street historic district. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11783.361s">As</a>  you all know, South Street is one of the most historic and beautiful portions of all of Manhattan. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11794.348s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11795.809s">Can</a>  you hear me now? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11796.63s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11799.116s">So</a>  yes, so South Street is one of the most beautiful and historic parts of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11807.182s">It</a>  has particularly a large number of houses that were built before the Civil War by people, many of whom were associated with the shipbuilding industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11817.491s">sea</a>  captains, wealthy merchants, timber merchants, and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11823.315s">So</a>  the ships that you see on the Medford seal is actually quite closely associated with South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11834.364s">So</a>  this is what South Street looked like in 1880. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11840.108s">Almost,</a>  I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11847.031s">Almost</a>  all the houses that we are proposing to protect in this historic district are actually on this map, all the way from Grandfather's House over here, down to 23 South Street down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11862.282s">And</a>  of course, including 21 Toro, a beautiful federal revival, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11872.987s">federal</a>  house on Turo Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11878.951s">So</a>  let me just run through these houses very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11885.695s">This</a>  is 12 Maple Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11887.376s">You</a>  can see an absolutely beautiful house from 1845. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11890.217s">Captain</a>  Redmond was the sea captain in the, associated with the Medford shipbuilding industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11896.781s">I</a>  put asterisks next to people who were associated with the shipbuilding industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11902.581s">Fannie</a>  Richardson was the, I believe, the widow or a daughter of a shipbuilder. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11908.947s">This</a>  house was built in 1849. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11913.37s">This</a>  house, well, I'll come back to talking about this house, but just please remember it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11919.035s">30</a>  South Street, 1835, another beautiful old house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11927.422s">Also,</a>  as in most of these houses, pre-Civil War. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11932.405s">The</a>  Luther Turner house, Mr. Turner was a more, was not a wealthy man. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11936.969s">He</a>  will, I believe he was, he worked in the, actually worked in the shipyards and he built this house in 1852. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11946.157s">The</a>  Ann Butters house, this is a little bit later than the, this is little, this is post-Civil War, but there's another beautiful house right on South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11957.914s">48</a>  South Street, this is George Fuller's house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11960.195s">George</a>  Fuller was a, I believe he was a timber merchant that served the shipbuilding industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11966.517s">He</a>  built this beautiful house in 1851. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11968.177s">54</a>  South Street, now you may have heard of 54 South Street with the various hearings before the Zoning Board recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11981.861s">This</a>  is a beautiful, beautiful house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11984.182s">I've</a>  seen it up close very, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11989.631s">Up</a>  close, it even has original windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11991.592s">This</a>  house has 19th century windows, which is quite unusual, even for this neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12000.555s">60</a>  South Street, I'll come back to this house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12003.316s">This</a>  is a somewhat later house, but also quite beautiful house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12008.899s">66</a>  South Street, 1855, the same year as another house in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12016.316s">54,</a>  built in 1840, one of the earlier houses in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12022.381s">A</a>  person, something of note, a person, a 20th century poet who lived in Medford, John Chardy, actually grew up in this house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12034.891s">And</a>  he was a well-known poet in the 1950s and 60s, mainly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12044.682s">And</a>  102 South Street, very early house in this district, also beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12050.907s">And</a>  of course, Grandfather's House, 114 South Street, that was owned by Tufts University for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12059.841s">but</a>  was sold to a developer without notice to anyone some years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12064.724s">There</a>  was quite a bit of contention about what was going to happen to this house when the developer bought it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12070.568s">The</a>  house, fortunately, was preserved, but they built a prefab out next to it that would have been reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12079.194s">If</a>  this house had been in historic district at that time, that process would have been reviewed by us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12087.848s">11</a>  Toro Avenue, another early house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12092.872s">Now,</a>  21 Toro, also owned by Tufts University, also sold to a developer about 10 years ago, also the source of much contention, a very beautiful house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12106.841s">And</a>  unlike what happened with Grandfather's House, this entire large lot was preserved in part due to a lot of community activism. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12123.68s">One</a>  monastery, this is the oldest house in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12126.824s">And</a>  I'll come back and talk about this house as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12133.45s">15,</a>  Louisa Richardson was the, I believe the widow of a sea captain. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12140.197s">She</a>  lived in this beautiful house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12143.226s">Okay,</a>  so this is the proposed South Street Historic District. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12148.489s">We</a>  held a number of hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12152.171s">In</a>  what the mayor sent you, mentioned just one hearing, we actually held two hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12157.914s">In</a>  one of them, in the first hearing, the owner of 6 to 8 Manning Street, this house right here, said, well, my house is just a generic, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12170.922s">early</a>  20th century triple-decker, why is it in the historic district? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12175.084s">And</a>  we thought about it, we talked about it, we took a vote, and we decided to remove that house from the historic district. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12184.068s">Because,</a>  you know, we hold hearings for a reason, we want to hear what people say, and I think this is evidence that we listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12197.381s">There</a>  are two other owners who have expressed concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12202.023s">Mr.</a>  Johnson, who owns 23 South Street, has expressed concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12207.364s">He's</a>  a developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12208.825s">We</a>  have worked with developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12212.006s">I've</a>  been on this commission for 23 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12214.687s">We</a>  have worked with developers year in and year out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12219.809s">We</a>  have nothing against development. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12221.689s">In</a>  fact, the last people who would oppose development would have been the Victorians who built these houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12228.616s">they</a>  believed in organic, sorry, they believed in changing buildings to meet the needs of changing times, and we believe in that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12238.38s">We</a>  just want that change to be organic and in keeping with the character of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12244.222s">We</a>  have told Mr. Johnson that we will work with him in developing this house in a way that works for him as well as for the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12253.802s">Another</a>  house that I want to talk about specifically, the owner's concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12258.786s">Mr.</a>  King owns 60 South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12262.509s">This</a>  house was built in 1912. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12266.532s">He</a>  said, well, why is it being included in this house if we're focusing on pre-Civil War buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12274.377s">Well,</a>  it's a beautiful house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12276.018s">It's</a>  over a century old. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12277.42s">It's</a>  one of the keystones of this <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12281.573s">of</a>  this proposed historic district, and we feel that it should be retained in spite of being of somewhat later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12288.777s">And</a>  let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12293.12s">Going</a>  here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12297.842s">Oh,</a>  no.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12298.623s">Last</a>  slide, please.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12299.764s">No,</a>  no, it's not my last slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12302.685s">Come</a>  on.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12310.21s">It's</a>  not moving.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12315.256s">All</a>  right, so I don't have any more substantial slides, but let me just say that, is everyone familiar with how a historic district is administered? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12333.22s">Are</a>  all of you familiar with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12335.74s">Everybody?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12337.18s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12338.341s">Oh,</a>  Mr. Leming, no, not so much? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12342.205s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12342.805s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12344.006s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12344.286s">So,</a>  so basically, um, we have, um, in order to, um, to get a building permit in a historic district, you need a certificate of appropriateness from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12355.914s">So</a>  we hold a hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12357.114s">We</a>  invite the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12359.136s">Um,</a>  we of course invite the owner and his architect if there is <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12363.78s">Oh,</a>  sorry, we invite, we of course invite the owner, we invite the neighbors, and sometimes the owner brings the architect along, and we discuss two things, the design and the materials of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12380.117s">The</a>  design has to be in keeping, we encourage the design to be in keeping with the design of this existing house and preferably the design of the houses, the general design of the houses in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12395.066s">So</a>  design is one consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12396.967s">The</a>  second consideration is materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12399.288s">We</a>  encourage, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12400.969s">owners,</a>  architects, and developers to use historically appropriate materials, or at the very least, materials that closely resemble historic materials, so that at a distance you might not be able to tell that the clabberding was not, for example, made of wood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12421.418s">So</a>  design and materials, that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12423.28s">Those</a>  are the only considerations. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12425.461s">We</a>  don't oppose in any way changing the footprint of the building, changing the height of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12437.869s">Basically</a>  anything that the original owner of the building might do, we would approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12445.615s">Yes,</a>  sir.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12449.913s">So</a>  just two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12451.995s">So</a>  to clarify, if somebody wanted to build an ADU on their house and they lived in a historic district, then you would require that the ADU be built with materials similar to the one that are used to currently construct the house?</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12463.843s">We</a>  would encourage that, yes.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12465.764s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12466.165s">The</a>  other one, and I've kind of been curious about this ever since I first saw this map a couple of months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12473.42s">Could</a>  you talk about the houses between, I believe it's 84 and 102, or are they just like newer buildings?</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12480.943s">These</a>  are newer buildings, mainly triple-deckers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12484.704s">Yeah,</a>  these are triple-deckers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12486.425s">And</a>  basically in the same category as this house that we, the 68 Manning that we removed at the request of the owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12492.587s">These</a>  are houses that don't, oh my God.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12498.186s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12499.106s">Use</a>  your arrow keys. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12500.027s">You</a>  can go back with the arrow key.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12502.608s">So</a>  when I get to my slide, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12504.289s">Design</a>  and materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12505.869s">Design</a>  in keeping with the existing house and the character of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12508.871s">Materials</a>  keeping with the existing house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12510.832s">Accept</a>  as necessary for practical reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12513.613s">For</a>  example, it is often very inappropriate to replace a rotted window sill with another piece of wood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12523.637s">That's</a>  just inviting the same thing to happen 20 years later. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12528.914s">In</a>  cases like that, we allow a material like azek, which is a type of vinyl material that really looks like painted wood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12539.392s">In</a>  fact, when I <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12542.829s">was</a>  redoing the window sills in my own house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12546.513s">My</a>  contractor, even without asking me, put in ASEC window sills because he said, you would be completely crazy not to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12554.221s">So</a>  in cases where there's moisture or concerns like that, yes, we allow synthetic materials.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12562.0s">And</a>  for those who have not seen Chris zoom in to a public meeting, Chris lives in a historic home where people of my height may occasionally knock their heads on a doorframe.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12571.586s">Yes,</a>  it's very true. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12573.247s">These</a>  houses, 298 High Street was built in 1685. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12574.508s">And</a>  yeah, the ceilings are beautiful.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12584.614s">Yes,</a>  George Washington did not choose to cite his headquarters in that home. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12593.503s">A</a>  joke for me and Larry and Chris. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12596.145s">Council,</a>  any more questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12598.067s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12600.569s">Thank</a>  you so much for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12602.771s">I</a>  know this project has been a long time in the works, and I appreciate your overview and presentation about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12610.839s">I</a>  have a general understanding about what historic designation, what implication that has and doesn't have for how those properties might be affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12620.952s">You've</a>  spoken a little bit about how it's not an absolute prohibition on any particular material. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12625.509s">working</a>  with developers so that I know renovations still happen under historic designation, EDUs can still happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12632.134s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12634.016s">Because</a>  so much of, well, speaking for myself as one councilor, because a large part of the council's goals this term are to consider proposals that do allow us to look at tools that <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12648.621s">enable</a>  different neighborhoods to evolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12651.043s">I</a>  am, I have a healthy skepticism around tools that might make it more difficult for developers to <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12661.491s">do</a>  things like, I understand there's no prohibition on adding height, on affecting footprint, but I have some concerns around adding rules that will make it less likely for developers to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12674.458s">Have</a>  you noticed in historic districts already in place in Medford, is there indeed a lag with developers or owners taking advantage of things that are still technically available to them?</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12684.383s">Not</a>  at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12684.723s">I</a>  can cite two specific examples where <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12691.63s">said</a>  seven house in Hillside, they expanded this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12695.339s">So,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12700.925s">Okay,</a>  yes, so I can refer specifically to two houses where we've worked with the developers to expand the footprint of the house and or the height of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12713.11s">At</a>  7 Hillside, we held, I think, monthly meetings over a period of, I think, four or five months, working hand in hand with the architect. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12724.458s">the</a>  developers or architect to turn a very, very large house in the Hillside Historic District into an even bigger house that was being turned into multiple condominiums. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12738.553s">And</a>  we had absolutely no problem with expanding the footprint of the house, with expanding the height of certain parts of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12748.798s">And</a>  I think he achieved his financial goals, and the city preserved a very conspicuous house in the Hillside Historic District. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12760.703s">Also</a>  on High Street, an owner wanted to add to the height of the building, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12768.823s">That</a>  was absolutely no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12770.364s">We</a>  sorry, Chris.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12771.104s">It's</a>  hard to do.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12771.584s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12773.205s">Uh,</a>  an owner on high street wanted to, um, expand the height of the building, uh, to make the third floor a full fully functional. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12784.171s">Um</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12785.651s">part</a>  of the house, and we had absolutely no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12791.473s">We</a>  discussed what the roof line might should look like from a historic standpoint, but the developer really had no problem with that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12800.777s">So</a>  we have a history of working developers, and we're committed to work with developers in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12805.579s">Does</a>  that answer your question?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12811.001s">Appreciate</a>  that.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12813.201s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12813.802s">Councilor</a>  Scrivner? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12816.621s">Thank</a>  you for all your work, Tom. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12817.725s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12818.368s">But</a>  the questions that residents called me and they're just concerned that yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12823.069s">Yeah,</a>  and I appreciate the developers and having that control, but the conversations I had with a few neighbors that here are a few homes that aren't in the historical realm, and they would need approval to change the color of their house or a window frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12842.414s">That's</a>  what they've told me. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12843.634s">So</a>  maybe we can dispel those rumors.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12846.695s">First</a>  of all, the Medford statute <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12851.062s">that</a>  exists that we are not proposing change gives us no jurisdiction whatsoever over house color. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12856.806s">You</a>  can paint your house any color you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12859.728s">And</a>  that's often something that people are concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12863.731s">As</a>  far as materials, we're not opposed to artificial materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12868.154s">We</a>  encourage people to use traditional materials if that's practical for the developer and practical for the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12876.259s">but</a>  we allow artificial materials where that is simply from a contractor standpoint really necessary.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12883.643s">Okay,</a>  so that's, with developers, listen, I support this and I understand what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12889.947s">I</a>  think that what I'm hearing is just the neighbors that are saying, what's recommended for materials if they had to make a change in their home and they're living on a fixed income. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12902.151s">and</a>  how that could relate to their processes if they needed something to be remodeled. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12907.715s">I</a>  think that's the biggest concern and where it falls in. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12911.558s">I</a>  think that really hasn't been delineated for, okay, this home was built in 1974 and they want to replace some windows and the windows might not fit in the criteria that we might be looking at with the commission, but it's affordable for the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12931.531s">sure</a>  so i think that that's my biggest concern with this i don't think that i've heard that it we've been saying that it's been recommended but if they say no what are the ramifications um well i was gonna put this on the slide but but but um we've actually never said no okay <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12957.874s">But</a>  how long are you going to be there?</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12959.916s">I've</a>  only been on the commission for 23 years.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12962.117s">I</a>  know that.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12962.958s">So</a>  they may have said no before me. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12964.759s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12966.581s">And</a>  part of that, of course, is that people know, you know, not to ask for certain things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12972.505s">But</a>  we work with people. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12974.887s">And</a>  we have literally never said no to anyone.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12977.987s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12978.628s">I</a>  like I said, I think that what you're doing and what we're doing that in that neighborhood for years, I mean, and I know that, you know, for my friend sharing music, who is a strong proponent and former former school commember with myself and <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12993.459s">you</a>  know, I know the passion she had. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12994.84s">So</a>  it's not like I said, it's not, this isn't something that I would talk against because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12999.523s">But</a>  I think that the biggest piece is that everyone has the neighbors that are concerned that many people have.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13005.246s">And</a>  I said, totally, it's absolutely completely legitimate concern that we address every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13012.725s">By</a>  the way, let me just say one thing about our frequency of meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13016.127s">We</a>  want to be the rocket docket on these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13018.508s">We</a>  don't want to be, you know, hold up some kind of, we know that people can't get their building permit until we give them the certificate of appropriateness. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13026.751s">If</a>  they want to start, you know, construction next week, we hold a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13033.799s">and</a>  we've done that many, we've done that, I mean, we're all volunteers, we prefer not to do that, but yeah, if somebody wants to start work next week, we will hold a meeting right before that.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13044.063s">And</a>  I appreciate you and I appreciate who's here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13047.424s">My</a>  fear is if we're putting the disordinates in, it's the next group that comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13051.326s">If</a>  they come in and they have a hard line and they're like, no, we're not gonna do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13054.787s">Well,</a>  you get to control who.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13057.088s">Yeah,</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13058.669s">Well,</a>  no, we don't.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13064.568s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13065.771s">Vice</a>  President Collins?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13067.014s">Thank</a>  you, President Burris. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13072.105s">Sorry,</a>  it's getting late. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13073.108s">Brain's</a>  slowing down. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13076.042s">Really</a>  appreciate this discussion really appreciate this kind of formal introduction to the issue though of course we've heard glimmers of it before when this was still in process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13085.668s">I</a>  think that, at least for me as one counselor I think this is a topic that you know of course there's already historic designation along South Street already, but this does mark a significant expansion in that footprint. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13097.854s">And</a>  I think, you know, to echo some of what Councilor Scarpelli just said, I think that it seems very clear to me that for every concern or question we have, there's a ready answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13108.685s">That</a>  being, notwithstanding that being the case, you know, it's pretty rare for us to take a first vote on an ordinance when it's first introduced before the Council, and I think <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13119.332s">know,</a>  in the role that we inhabit on the City Council, especially with something as longstanding as an ordinance, we can feel incredible about how a current Board of Commissioners takes up their mission and implements it, and certainly I feel great about the work that <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13135.763s">you</a>  all do and how you've been doing and how you've been collaborating with community members and developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13139.727s">But</a>  this is something that marks a big enough change that I'd like to give it a bit more conversation and deliberation before we take votes on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13146.473s">So</a>  I would make the motion to perhaps refer into the planning and permitting committee where we take up other building related topics for more of a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13158.824s">to</a>  go over the details of the questions raised by councillors before we move forward, unless there's an alternative proposal raised by my fellow councillors.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13166.732s">We're</a>  glad to meet with you in any format whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13172.838s">Oh,</a>  we're glad to meet with you in any format whatsoever, whatever works for you guys.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13182.173s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[Historic Commission]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13182.914s">If</a>  I could just add one thing about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13186.057s">We've</a>  been at this for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13188.78s">And</a>  I'd like to add that we are following an ordinance laid out by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for establishing local historic districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13198.15s">And</a>  there are 12 steps involved in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13201.957s">You</a>  don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13203.078s">You're</a>  the ninth step. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13204.199s">So</a>  we've gone ninth. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13205.4s">We</a>  still have two more to go before it's an official ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13209.864s">But</a>  the Commonwealth has laid out a very specific and a very detailed method. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13215.75s">So</a>  that's why it takes a long time to get these districts in place, in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13222.716s">And</a>  we've sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13225.78s">this</a>  district because of the quality homes all pre 18 60 18 50. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13230.964s">Most</a>  of them a couple exceptions to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13234.166s">But</a>  the districts they need to be continuous boundaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13236.907s">They</a>  need to have significance that needs to be approved by the Mass historical commission and things, so I'm just putting that out there that it's been a deliberative process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13246.914s">We've</a>  tried to follow those steps every step of the way, getting all the signatures and the sign offs and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13252.558s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13253.444s">your</a>  one step, we're still on the journey. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13255.646s">So</a>  I appreciate your help with that.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13259.328s">Any</a>  other comments, Councilor Tseng, um, I just wanted to thank you for your patience tonight and for coming here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13265.372s">So,</a>  you know, with so much, so many materials for us to review before the meeting and to look at during the meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13270.676s">And</a>  for being so prepared for our questions, um, I don't look for at all, um, five minute walk at most, if not three minute walk, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13279.702s">I'm</a>  quite excited about this because I've always believed that our history in Medford is something that makes us unique and makes us stand out as a city even in such a historic area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13291.41s">I</a>  think Medford's history is so rich and to be able to protect it in the physical manner I think is so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13301.096s">So</a>  I'm happy to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13303.198s">I</a>  understand that there are concerns to talk through and I would <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13308.121s">respect</a>  that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13309.421s">But</a>  I wanted to thank you for your work.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13311.742s">Well,</a>  and I want to thank, I want to thank Fred and Joe for what they've done and Charlotte Scuderi was here before she got tired and went home. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13322.364s">A</a>  lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13323.224s">Oh,</a>  and one of the people, one of the folks who's retiring this evening, Janice, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13330.679s">has</a>  actually been very helpful to the historic district commission over the years and I want to congratulate her on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13341.651s">on</a>  her retirement and thank her for help getting us through this whole process of voting the Historic District Commission, submission of preliminary report, approval by the Mass Historical Commission, public hearings, approval by the County Development Board, and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13358.63s">I'd</a>  also like to thank <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13361.173s">Sylvia</a>  for, I believe it was Sylvia who may have sworn me in 23 years ago as a member of the Historic District Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13372.442s">So</a>  congratulations to you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13375.764s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13376.124s">Any</a>  further comments from members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13379.169s">I</a>  for one, South Street is just one of our most beautiful historic neighborhoods and I've been in the 21 Toro house and I remember the deep concerns with grandfather's house and yeah I mean this is one that just makes sense to me out of the gate. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13394.201s">I</a>  know a couple years ago we were talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13396.84s">the</a>  one parcel on foster court and I voted for it, didn't pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13401.501s">But</a>  this is contiguous. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13403.202s">It's</a>  so well evidenced, deeply supported. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13406.302s">The</a>  process has been so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13408.083s">I</a>  personally would be a strong proponent of approving it for first reading tonight myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13412.164s">But,</a>  you know, I just think this is <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13416.65s">This</a>  is exactly the place we need to go and I mean we see the pit right now on on South Street, next to that 5054. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13423.739s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13425.402s">And</a>  you know, again, I'm a huge proponent of building more housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13430.268s">But,</a>  and I think you brought up the grandfather's house case as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13434.218s">a</a>  little bit of a difference in outward appearance would have made a huge difference in the impact of that new construction on that property. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13439.941s">54</a>  has already gone through, so that as well will not have, but I mean, I think they made some decent considerations and historical commission has had some leverage with the preferably preserved, but this is a neighborhood where, you know, I don't think we got enough necessarily and a neighborhood that really needs it because it is just a major historic quarter with some historic buildings that still have <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13461.653s">have</a>  not been switched to vinyl siding and have not had their main features and historic features just completely stripped and ripped away. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13470.356s">So</a>  I really see this neighborhood as 100% and this district specifically as constructed as a place to move ahead personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13478.659s">So</a>  thank you for your work on it.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13480.859s">Vice</a>  President Collins, are there any specific concerns that I could address this evening?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13488.762s">If</a>  I'm being totally candid,</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13491.981s">So</a>  are there any specific concerns that you have right now that I could address?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13497.565s">If</a>  I'm being candid, part of the reason for my desire to have more of this discussion in a separate meeting is because we have five or six major financial papers to take up after this, and I don't want to have that conversation right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13507.29s">That</a>  said, if there's another motion to approve it outright, we just take the votes, and I wouldn't take that personally.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13514.841s">Currently,</a>  any further comments from members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13517.201s">We</a>  have a motion on the floor from Vice President Collins to refer to planning and permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13522.242s">Is</a>  there a second on that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13524.463s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13527.383s">Is</a>  there any comments by members of the public on this item? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13529.924s">Raise</a>  your hands on Zoom or come to the podium and share. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13533.145s">So</a>  I'm gonna go first to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13535.725s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13538.026s">And</a>  you'll have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Kenworthy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13540.305s">Hi,</a>  Scott Kenworthy, 23 South Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13544.727s">I'm</a>  just here tonight to say that we really don't need government on our property doing anything more to our property than we already have to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13558.113s">And</a>  the reason why I say that is I've worked with Chris in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13562.075s">I've</a>  worked with a historic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13564.195s">I'm</a>  the only guy that's given my financials to the ZBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13568.385s">on</a>  projects as to what my bottom line is, so they could be totally transparent and they could see what I was doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13575.009s">And</a>  I'm retired now, so I don't have any skin in the game here at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13579.492s">But</a>  I can tell you that, or any of you through the chair, are familiar with the Secretary of Interior's website, because I've been through 10 years of historic commission meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13592.435s">And</a>  I can tell you that Chris is a great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13596.977s">I</a>  love working with Chris. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13599.458s">But</a>  Chris mentioned a few things that I have to correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13603.639s">And</a>  what he was saying was correct as far as he's concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13607.14s">But</a>  when the historic commission comes in, they're not going to allow me to raise my roof if I wanted to raise my roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13613.883s">Because</a>  they like this certain pitch, and they want to just keep it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13617.504s">So</a>  that part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13620.39s">We</a>  have to deal with the historic commission on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13623.611s">The</a>  other thing is, it's very divisive when you deal with people in neighborhoods, and you want to say to some people, you know, it's almost like having a wedding, and only having chicken, people go, where's the fish, you know, don't you have chicken and fish. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13641.3s">in</a>  this neighborhood wants to go and be historic with their house, they can go ahead and do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13647.305s">And</a>  the historic district commission can also have a part in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13652.869s">But</a>  there's people who want to abstain from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13655.771s">They</a>  want to opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13658.113s">So</a>  we should be able to opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13661.126s">I</a>  did own quite a few houses on South Street, and in that neighborhood, maybe eight or 10 houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13667.687s">And</a>  we put millions of dollars into those properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13671.428s">And</a>  I've had some meetings where I think that I may know better than some of the people that I was dealing with. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13679.849s">And</a>  there's got to be a trust factor there that some people, you've got to give them the responsibility and let them do what they want to do with their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13689.952s">I</a>  will always work with these guys and historic commission, historic district commission, but to impose this on us is unnecessary, totally unnecessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13702.901s">And</a>  also it kind of, it also leaves things open to corruption. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13708.264s">And</a>  if you don't think this corruption in Medford, I'm just going to drop a ball right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13713.588s">I've</a>  lived it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13714.708s">I</a>  had a major heart attack, 2019 that was, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13719.738s">precipitated</a>  by Paul Moki and the way he ran your building department for 30 years.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13724.522s">You</a>  have about 30 seconds.</p>

    <p>[Kenworthy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13725.683s">And</a>  so the bottom line is, I'm here because I don't want people to go through what I've been through. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13732.168s">And</a>  every time a rule is made in this town, believe me, it is done as a tollgate. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13738.393s">And</a>  there's people in here that are getting passes, and there's other people that aren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13742.156s">And</a>  that's violating our rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13744.198s">So</a>  I'm against anything that's gonna restrict <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13748.783s">people</a>  and our properties down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13750.546s">We</a>  own the properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13751.749s">You</a>  have to trust that we're going to do the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13754.824s">The</a>  gentleman that just dug that big hole, I sold him 109 Forest Street because I had to get out of town back then because of all the corruption that was going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13764.731s">And</a>  Jamal will do a fantastic job. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13767.732s">Go</a>  by 109 Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13769.374s">Take</a>  a look at the garage he built. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13771.235s">Take</a>  a look at the townhouse he built there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13773.536s">There's</a>  no problem with what he's doing on South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13776.438s">And</a>  I'll stake everything I've worked for on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13780.081s">So</a>  you have to trust people.</p>

    <p>[Deborah Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13790.518s">My</a>  name is Deborah Beard Bader. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13792.199s">I'm</a>  actually Christopher's wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13794.961s">And</a>  we both lived in Medford for four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13798.625s">I've</a>  recently retired and moved up to Southern New Hampshire so I can have chickens and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13804.45s">But</a>  we lived at High Street for 23 years, I believe, on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13809.975s">And</a>  I've owned two, over the course of my life, historic homes in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13815.74s">And</a>  one of the great things about Medford is historic homes, and not enough cities have that resource. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13823.285s">And</a>  I totally disagree with the prior speaker that we want to have everything laissez-faire. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13829.189s">We'll</a>  end up like Somerville or someplace like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13832.411s">You</a>  cannot protect historic homes enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13836.853s">It's</a>  a resource not just for the individual owner, but it belongs to the community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13842.537s">This</a>  is not the first historic district in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13845.838s">There</a>  are several others. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13847.298s">It's</a>  now been a two-year review process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13850.979s">And</a>  I will complain as the wife of the man who went to all of these meetings for two years, that an extensive amount of work has gone into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13859.181s">There</a>  has been meetings with the Butters. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13861.362s">There's</a>  been meetings with neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13863.342s">All</a>  of the conversations have been positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13866.143s">People</a>  have supported this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13867.703s">And</a>  now it is before the board, is in front of the city council, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13871.764s">to</a>  make this decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13874.508s">We</a>  have these commissions so that they can study these questions, talk to the <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13880.518s">the</a>  stakeholders and see how they feel about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13883.62s">The</a>  stakeholders are fine with this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13886.102s">It</a>  has worked very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13887.603s">And</a>  to continue to delay this because one, perhaps one board member or city councilor wants to perhaps study it longer when we've had the material under advisement and had the community discussions for two years <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13904.476s">strikes</a>  me as crazy because the problem we have is this is not an infinite amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13910.601s">We</a>  have had problems in that area and other parts of Medford that should also probably be considered for historic districts as well because this is a finite resource that is under fire every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13922.571s">Time</a>  goes by and we lose old houses on the regular in Medford and it's a tragedy and it's not something you can get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13930.7s">And</a>  this is a great project. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13932.223s">It's</a>  a great area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13933.184s">Too</a>  many people work too hard to just sit around and say, gee, I just want to think about it a little bit longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13938.593s">There</a>  have been many hearings on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13940.536s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13941.878s">You</a>  have 30 seconds.</p>

    <p>[Deborah Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13943.422s">For</a>  two years, I think the time to have any further debate on whether there should be a public role in private housing is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13951.689s">We</a>  know what that role is and we have the legislation for it and it's working well in all the other historic districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13958.375s">This</a>  is just one small new district. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13962.298s">That's</a>  all I have to say.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13964.0s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13965.841s">Any</a>  further comment from members of the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13968.483s">Seeing</a>  none, I'll go to Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13970.862s">I</a>  just have one question for the members of the Historic District Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13974.844s">When</a>  you were deciding which district to choose for those, what other areas were you sort of considering? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13983.49s">And</a>  can you just delve a little bit more into the specific rationale for choosing South Street?</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13989.894s">Well,</a>  there are Victorian houses all over Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13993.57s">And</a>  if we went for the Victorian houses, we would be talking about thousands of houses in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14002.314s">We</a>  specifically, the number of pre-Civil War houses is much, much smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14008.698s">These</a>  are the pre-Civil War houses and they're grouped together in a way that is integral to the history of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14015.441s">And</a>  that is why we focused on South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14019.543s">Is</a>  that your question?</p>

    <p>[Historic Commission]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14022.375s">I'll</a>  just mention that it's directly related to the shipbuilding history of Clippership City, and these have direct connections to that logo on our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14032.761s">That's</a>  why specifically South Street and these ones that are pre-Civil War, 1850, 1830, are important to the city.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14044.387s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14045.728s">Any</a>  further discussion by members of the Council or the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14047.989s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14050.044s">Motion</a>  to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14051.586s">I</a>  know Councilor Collins has a motion to send it to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14060.194s">So</a>  I'm not sure if I can motion to.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14061.976s">We</a>  do have a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14063.177s">We</a>  can't have a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14064.758s">So</a>  we would have to vote that motion or without that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14068.581s">And</a>  this is an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14069.742s">I'll</a>  just read it really quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14070.703s">This</a>  would amend sections 4851 and 4852 of the municipal code to include the words fixes what adds to the list and a South Street historic district. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14084.958s">twice</a>  in section 4851 and once in section 4852, and it also would set forth that the South Street Historic District is and shall hereby be created with the boundaries of the said South Street Historic District being as shown on the map entitled South Street Historic District prepared by the City of Medford Historic District Commission dated November 9th, 2023, a copy of which is on file with the city clerk and is to be recorded at the Middlesex South District Registry of Deeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14111.587s">So</a>  that is the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14113.905s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro, do you have a further comment?</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14115.685s">Yes,</a>  my reasoning behind my motion to carry this forward as written is that, sorry, I don't know why there's so much feedback when I use my microphone.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14127.848s">If</a>  you turn your microphone, if these front two microphones are technically in front of the speakers, and I think the speakers are very loud tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14135.829s">It's</a>  just where I'm sitting.</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14865.801s">Mr.</a>  President, through you, I don't recall any discussions on the financial task force as to the specific amount in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14874.166s">We</a>  didn't have those details at the time of our last meeting.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14877.908s">Okay,</a>  so I know that my fellow councils, we have five money papers in front of us, and they, I believe, what was it you implemented? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14891.83s">the</a>  rules to avoid Rule 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14896.794s">I</a>  will do this with all the papers tonight, but as my right, I'm invoking state law under Chapter 43, Section 22, which reads, Section 22, any ordinance or order or resolution may be passed through all stages of legislation at one session, provided that no member of the Council objects thereto. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14917.39s">If</a>  any member of the council objects, the measure shall be postponed for that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14921.392s">So</a>  I'm going to vote that right for the fact that we're pushing things through and we're not getting the information, at least this council is not getting the information they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14930.136s">And</a>  it's a tactic that's very silly that we're going to try to get information that was passed, that was information that was given to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14939.68s">And</a>  I made sure that we reached out to the state legal department and they said, any budget paper, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14946.523s">If</a>  this is invoked, our ordinance is invoked, then I can supersede that with the state ordinance until I, as one city council, who finds this process so faulty, and so smelling with the lack of transparency, that we're so confused of where this money is coming from, and I've used this many, many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14973.062s">You're</a>  all very bright people. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14975.566s">I'm</a>  not saying anybody's doing anything illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14979.008s">I'm</a>  telling you this is financial mismanagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14981.989s">We</a>  asked for a $7.5 million override on the fare of our families and children. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14987.972s">I</a>  wanted to propose a $5 million free cash proposal that eliminate that fare, then the community can look to see whether we need an override or not, which I wouldn't oppose. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14998.116s">But</a>  instead, we required it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15001.097s">I</a>  was stifled. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15003.154s">And</a>  then we moved to the next meeting, which was the budget meeting, and we had similar questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15009.537s">Now</a>  we move to the next meeting, we come up with $9 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15014.36s">We</a>  have $34 million in free cash, with an override still hanging out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15021.023s">Are</a>  we still nervous about the kids in the schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15023.644s">Well,</a>  I have the right to invoke this rule, and I do so, and I will do with all money papers tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15029.447s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15030.916s">Thank</a>  you, whereas chapter 43, section 22 applies to ordinances and their multiple readings, and none of the papers require multiple readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15040.538s">We're</a>  gonna keep moving on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15043.459s">I</a>  have a question to the chair.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15045.819s">I've</a>  been instructed by legal industry that this is a money paper that I can implement at my disposal, in my discretion, and I do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15055.781s">So</a>  I question the chair, if you wanna stretch this out even longer,</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15061.855s">Do</a>  you have a written legal opinion I can review? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15066.202s">Is</a>  there a written legal opinion for review by the chair?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15067.984s">I</a>  am opposing rule 22.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15074.639s">Yeah,</a>  Chapter 43, Section 22 applies to ordinances for multiple readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15078.28s">General</a>  law. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15079.38s">I'm</a>  reading it right now.</p>

    <p>[Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15080.381s">General</a>  law, Title 1, Title 12, Chapter 43, Section 22.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15085.082s">Yes,</a>  I have it in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15086.562s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15087.182s">I</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15087.923s">Yes,</a>  it reads.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15089.623s">You</a>  want to play the game, so I'm playing the game with you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15092.444s">I</a>  know, I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15093.004s">Because</a>  it's kind of funny that when you want to talk about information, I've implemented my right.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15098.746s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, do you have a written legal opinion for the chair on this matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15101.747s">I</a>  will get you that tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15103.747s">I</a>  limit choice of the discretion of the chairs that I read. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15107.028s">I'll</a>  read chapter 43, section 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15108.289s">Any</a>  ordinance order or resolution may be passed through all its stages of legislation at one session, provided that no member of the council objects thereto. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15116.532s">But</a>  if any member of the council objects, the measure shall be postponed for that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15119.834s">Ordinances</a>  have multiple stages of legislation, a first reading, a second reading, and a third reading, whereas none of the paper, at least the paper before us, and if your intent is to apply it to 24428, 24432, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15132.859s">24433</a>  and 24434. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15137.335s">Well,</a>  I'd have to read 24434. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15139.937s">That</a>  may be an ordinance amendment, but at least the first four are not ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15143.319s">They</a>  don't require multiple stages. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15145.52s">And</a>  therefore the objection doesn't apply and the rule, the law doesn't apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15149.263s">The</a>  law does because if the council would like to provide a legal opinion to the chair, we've done that.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15157.408s">And</a>  if you want, I've questioned the chair, I've put in the rule moving forward.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15162.632s">There's</a>  a motion to challenge the ruling of the chair by councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15166.575s">Is</a>  there a second?</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15171.179s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15172.059s">On</a>  the motion to challenge the ruling of the chair by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15175.703s">Madam</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15177.945s">No,</a>  it isn't debatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15179.286s">It's</a>  not debatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15180.327s">I</a>  mean, the principle here is absolutely unquestionable.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15183.049s">It's</a>  not debatable.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15183.67s">The</a>  motion is not debatable.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15184.871s">The</a>  rule is not debatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15186.232s">It</a>  doesn't apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15187.513s">Okay,</a>  remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15190.23s">When</a>  you pulled this last week, I did my due diligence to make sure that the information is getting out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15195.475s">It's</a>  funny, we can have five meetings in subcommittee about a newsletter, but you wanna take these motions on money papers and force it down people's throat without giving it its due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15207.465s">Shame</a>  on all of you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15208.426s">No,</a>  I think it has plenty of due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15211.048s">There</a>  you go, rule 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15212.569s">The</a>  motion's undebatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15214.351s">Madam</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15215.952s">Madam</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15219.406s">Madam</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15222.688s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15227.83s">This</a>  is on the motion to overrule the ruling of the chair that chapter 43, section 22 does not apply to this paper as this paper is not an ordinance that requires three readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15242.658s">Councilor</a>  Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15249.286s">We'll</a>  go to the next.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15254.548s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15255.128s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15258.889s">Said</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15278.528s">No</a>  negative emotion fails the ruling of the chairs that chapter 43 section 22 does not apply to this I would appreciate if you could provide it tonight without legal fighting for transparency and open government</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15306.243s">I'll</a>  text you, Ken. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15307.324s">We'll</a>  talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15308.525s">But</a>  that's a disgrace.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15310.127s">Well,</a>  you know, again, there's been no evidence presented.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15313.57s">Have</a>  any of you talked to the administration for $9 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15320.816s">The</a>  20, the July. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15325.781s">You</a>  agree to call on Bob anytime.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15328.527s">We're</a>  gonna maintain business and we're gonna move forward on this item. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15333.489s">Oh,</a>  so many people are so, so many accusations of shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15338.65s">So</a>  many accusations. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15340.891s">Let's</a>  move ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15342.371s">I</a>  would like to continue on this item. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15344.992s">Are</a>  these questions related to the item before us? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15347.713s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming and Vice President Collins and then Councilor Sviggum. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15354.335s">Forum</a>  is for, required. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15356.275s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15357.176s">And</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15360.136s">I</a>  just wanted to speak on the appropriation for Medford High School MSBA feasibility study, which is required for us to receive any funding from the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15371.32s">We</a>  must do a feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15375.102s">The</a>  way that free cash works is that it is calculated based on what was budgeted for the prior year, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15386.265s">and</a>  what was spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15388.186s">So</a>  free cash will come about at various points during the year and if it's not spent, it shows up and is available for the use of the municipality at various points. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15403.052s">That's</a>  why free cash became available. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15406.413s">Free</a>  cash is being used for this non-negotiable <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15412.355s">feasibility</a>  study that we must do if we hope to ever have access to Massachusetts School Building Authority funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15424.122s">Since</a>  we are shortlisted, I'm on the building committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15427.565s">We</a>  have been meeting about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15430.106s">This</a>  committee, this council must approve this in order to move forward with building a new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15438.071s">So</a>  it's imperative that we approve this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15442.093s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15442.694s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15443.314s">And</a>  just before we continue, I just want to explain the free cash process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15449.8s">As</a>  Councilor Lazzaro was noting, the previous free cash certification was for July 1 of 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15456.947s">That</a>  was in the amount of $25 million and change. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15460.97s">Last</a>  week, the Department of the Division of Local Services, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15465.534s">issued</a>  a free cash certification for the city as of July 1, 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15470.759s">While</a>  the free cash amount was not certified, and that amount was $34 million, while that amount had not been certified when the financial task force was having its discussions, we were very aware <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15482.128s">that</a>  the reason for free cash balance amounts and the certification of amounts was due to essentially three factors. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15490.211s">One</a>  was the use of ARPA funds provided by the federal government instead of free cash in many situations over the past three fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15498.075s">The</a>  second was the conservative estimation of local receipts as part of revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15503.197s">I</a>  see Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15505.258s">Was</a>  the conservative estimation of local receipts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15509.039s">As</a>  part of the local revenues, as we heard from our finance director this year, the amount estimated for local receipts for the fiscal 25 budget is at the upper bounds of comfort of what we have submitted, and I'm seeing a smirk and smile. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15523.73s">Mr.</a>  Dickinson, and it's a fingers crossed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15528.112s">And</a>  the third was turned back to open positions, most of which have been filled, there was no expectation whatsoever by anyone familiar with the finances of the city that we will continue to see free cash balance increases of five to $10 million a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15542.698s">Those</a>  are not reliable revenue sources, they're not stable revenue sources, and they are not responsible revenue sources to base our budgets on or to suggest that we have enough funding for Medford Public Schools or for DPW or for a new Medford Fire Headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15559.672s">So</a>  those are the facts of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15561.934s">Those</a>  are the financial statistics of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15565.457s">That</a>  is why even though there is a free cash balance certified <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15568.939s">as</a>  of July 1, 2023 for fiscal 24, $34 million that we need the stable recurring revenues as proposed by the mayor and approved by the council for the override votes in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15582.192s">This</a>  is not, free cash is not a solution to those problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15584.614s">It</a>  never has been and it never will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15588.404s">We</a>  also have this amount, which is good, basically thanks to the federal ARPA program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15594.027s">There</a>  is a documentation in here outlining the draft free cash plan of the administration, which we can discuss tonight and consider further as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15605.113s">It</a>  brings us back down very, very quickly with our capital needs to the 10 to $15 million range of free cash reserves recommended by all of the state financial agencies for <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15617.833s">communities</a>  to have I think it's between five and 7% of their annual budget in a reserve and that's where this will bring us so. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15626.055s">The</a>  federal ARPA program did give us some spending in recent years that we otherwise wouldn't have had. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15630.776s">It</a>  gave us a little boost to address capital needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15633.797s">Those</a>  capital needs, even if we spent all 34 million on them tomorrow, would not address the massive capital deficit we have for our city facilities, school facilities, roads, sidewalks, water and sewer system, which as we've discussed at numerous meetings of this council, is in the hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15652.081s">With</a>  that, I will go to Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15657.162s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15658.843s">I</a>  think it's always helpful to have kind of a refresher on what free cash is and where it comes from, and the instability of that as a revenue source. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15675.371s">I</a>  was thinking about it today. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15676.351s">I</a>  was thinking about different ways to articulate it, and I think this is probably an imperfect way of conceptualizing it, but I was thinking of free cash as money that we did not intend to save, and that's partly true. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15686.836s">But</a>  in part, our free cash is amassed because of positions that we intended to fill and pay people salaries for that because of various reasons, we didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15697.023s">And</a>  I think the responsible thing to do with public resources when we intended to use it for one source and we for some reason couldn't spend it on, for example, a salary, is to use that as revenue for paying for a capital need. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15714.758s">where</a>  we otherwise wouldn't be able to amass the resources to, you know, we know that we have great capital needs in the city of Medford on so many of our public buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15726.466s">I</a>  mean, I could list them, but we don't even really need to between our public buildings and our roads and sidewalks and the high school, you know, on the topic of analogies. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15740.546s">We</a>  don't need more, we don't need more analogies tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15743.587s">I</a>  think what's what's what feels like a central fact to me in making any decision about where to appropriate a free cash is that, you know, to rephrase, it's in no way a sustainable or predictable revenue source I think that we can certainly expect to responsibly to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15762.755s">less</a>  free cash certified at the end of this fiscal year than we did at the end of this one, because a lot of those areas where we weren't spending as much as we were budgeting in FY 24, I know the administration worked really hard to get those out of the budget so that we could make the most use of every dollar that we are budgeting for. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15779.719s">And</a>  I think it's incredibly irresponsible to spend funds that have a really clear <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15787.0s">floor</a>  at the bottom of that bank account on needs that are not going away because they're part of our operating budget and they pay for the school experience and pay for teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15797.142s">Because</a>  what are we going to do when that money is gone? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15799.462s">It's</a>  not a sustainable revenue source. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15802.163s">But</a>  then I'm getting onto a future topic here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15805.063s">On</a>  the topic of the MSBA feasibility study, and we're talking about transparent government and, you know, leading in a way that manifests the will of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15814.765s">I</a>  know that a <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15816.445s">better,</a>  safer, more vibrant, more appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15818.826s">Medford</a>  High School is something that so many people in the community have been crying out for for such a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15823.908s">And</a>  this appropriation is a necessary step in the process of maintaining our eligibility for getting the funding that could get us there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15832.811s">And</a>  so this vote is crucial. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15834.191s">And</a>  I think this is an unambiguously good use for this $3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15837.993s">And</a>  I'll motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15841.854s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15842.674s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15845.66s">I</a>  don't want to meditate too much on this, but I would like to clarify because I said that I talked to the administration about free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15854.486s">And</a>  I want to clarify what I mean when I say that I talked to the administration is I Googled Bob Dickinson, the finance director's phone number, left him a voicemail, and then he got back to me and we talked for like, you know, half an hour about <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15869.736s">free</a>  cash, because when I saw, you know, $9 million, I was kind of like, what's going on here? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15874.598s">And</a>  so then, you know, the finance director has been working in this area for years, and me, who, as an elected official, doesn't suddenly mean that I know everything about finance, I talked to him about it, I asked my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15887.563s">And</a>  he explained, you know, what the situation was, it's not a simple issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15893.306s">Cities</a>  are kind of on a one year delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15895.146s">So</a>  in many ways, we're dealing now with what was budgeted last year, and we are <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15899.008s">going</a>  to be in our budget, and we're trying to predict what the budget will be next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15902.191s">They</a>  always come up with conservative estimates. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15903.812s">Part</a>  of the free cash comes from the fact that the police department couldn't hire 10 police officers, so that's $800,000 extra in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15912.119s">Obviously,</a>  if we want to be able to fill those positions, that is not revenue that we can expect to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15918.525s">next</a>  year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15919.326s">Part</a>  of it just came from poor, inaccurate estimations in previous years of what healthcare costs would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15925.473s">Those</a>  things are always hard to predict. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15929.939s">And</a>  part of this is the fact that we <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15933.263s">implement,</a>  you know, we have these one time very big studies to try to invest in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15938.811s">Obviously,</a>  we're debating many of those tonight costs like 15 million bucks to replace the HVAC systems for the middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15946.381s">So</a>  we need to, we need to spend, we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15950.106s">fix</a>  that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15951.628s">And</a>  we can't just say, Oh, here's $9 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15953.85s">Well,</a>  we should use that on salaries, continuing costs, which will just sink, which will just like eat up all of that money in a couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15964.34s">So,</a>  you know, in order to appropriately finance the city, it's not <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15969.645s">It's</a>  not an easy thing to explain, but at the end of the day, free cash goes to one-time costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15974.287s">You</a>  cannot count on it as an ongoing source of revenue, especially to handle salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15979.61s">The</a>  other thing to note is that being an elected official doesn't mean that people will suddenly make an effort to call me <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15992.717s">to</a>  give me information and include me in on things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15995.398s">It's</a>  my job to go out and seek that information and try to educate myself on things that happen, you know, just because, you know, being elected basically means that I get to sit in the seat and talk for however long I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16012.745s">I'm</a>  allowed to, and vote on ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16018.489s">If</a>  I was not involved in the financial task force in order to figure out how things work, any city councilor can do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16026.495s">You</a>  call up somebody, you seek out that information, you build up those relationships, and if you choose not to do that, then you won't be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16034.181s">That's</a>  just how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16035.682s">So</a>  I'd just like to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16038.444s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16046.164s">I'll</a>  second Vice President Collins' motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16051.028s">Any</a>  further discussion on the MSBA feasibility study, or is there a motion on the floor?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16055.131s">I</a>  just wanna say I'm excited for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16056.992s">Councilor</a>  Tseng, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16058.453s">I'm</a>  excited for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16059.494s">I</a>  think our community needs this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16060.895s">We</a>  need to assess our needs and the feasibility of a project that so many residents have been asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16066.78s">Great,</a>  motion's on the floor.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16068.121s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor to approve by Councilor Lazzaro, by Councilor Collins? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16075.796s">Vice</a>  President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16079.158s">On</a>  the motion to approve this appropriation of $3 million for the MSBA, and is there an amendment to the paper to change business to building? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16091.804s">On</a>  the motion to approve as amended by Vice President Collins, as seconded by Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16097.087s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16099.308s">Discussion</a>  members of the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16100.709s">Can</a>  I have an address for the record, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16101.87s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16105.27s">An</a>  obvious question to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16107.331s">We</a>  just realized that the citizens of Medford were overtaxed $9 million in fiscal year 23, and free cash went up that $9 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16116.055s">That's</a>  in fact what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16118.156s">They</a>  were overtaxed $9 million, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16120.677s">So</a>  now we have a $3 million feasibility study, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16124.639s">That</a>  we're just voting on today? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16126.94s">Feasibility</a>  study that you just talked about? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16129.161s">That</a>  is a one-time use, one-time expenditure <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16133.939s">which</a>  is necessary and proper as a free cash expenditure. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16138.3s">Why</a>  wouldn't we use that and free up that money for everything else? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16145.421s">Is</a>  that a certified use of free cash? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16147.421s">A</a>  legitimate, necessary, and proper use of free cash is a one-time expenditure, which is the $3 million that you just spoke about. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16154.603s">You</a>  can ask Bob Dickinson about it, he'll agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16157.463s">There</a>  are many things that you just talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16160.044s">HVAC</a>  systems, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16162.108s">for</a>  the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16163.349s">That</a>  is a one-time, one-off expenditure that can come from free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16168.653s">There</a>  are plenty of things in this budget that are qualified to be used from free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16174.497s">We</a>  have a $9 million overtaxing of the citizens that we just found out about from last year that could and should be used free cash expenditure. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16186.368s">I'm</a>  just wondering why we're not doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16188.689s">I</a>  mean, it's obvious to me where this money should go. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16191.691s">It</a>  should go back to the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16194.032s">And</a>  this would free up money for other projects, other recurring things that you can't use free cash for. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16201.661s">So</a>  just a question, suggestion, something that would help this budget and budgets to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16207.625s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16208.226s">Yes,</a>  the free cash balance that we have has come from unfilled positions, underestimated revenues, mainly in local receipts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16216.551s">So</a>  not really from the property tax and from the use of federal funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16220.594s">So</a>  we're now proposing to use those balances on these one-time expenditures like the feasibility study and the other things outlined in the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16229.994s">Your</a>  income was more than your expenses, our expenses that we budgeted for we were not able to spend because of things like, for example, 10 police officer positions were unfilled many things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16242.102s">So,</a>  and there were many positions unfilled correct so any money that wasn't used then to pay for overtime was turned back. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16249.767s">But</a>  we still need to budget that money going forward otherwise we'd have to cut 10 police officers or cut those firefighters so for that wasn't that there was an overtaxing, it was that the budget was not able to be spent exactly how was expected in June of the prior year so we, but we still need to spend that money, we took in more money than we expended.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16269.318s">It's</a>  very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16270.499s">There</a>  was a balance, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16272.401s">You</a>  don't have to make it so hard as people can't understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16275.323s">Well,</a>  I think you're misrepresenting it, so I need to explain what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16278.466s">I</a>  am not, believe me. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16279.907s">The</a>  citizens and the overtaxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16282.93s">If</a>  we were to return that money and then not spend it, we would then have to fire 10 police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16287.914s">It</a>  should go back to the rate payers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16289.415s">You</a>  shouldn't be hoarding cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16292.678s">$34</a>  million is probably the most that City of Medford has ever had in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16297.779s">It's</a>  way over and above what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16299.64s">You</a>  should be trying to break even every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16303.203s">It</a>  should go back to the rate payers into these projects that it is applicable for. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16310.388s">That's</a>  my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16311.549s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16508.732s">from</a>  Mayor Bernalino Kern to fund General Stabilization Establish and Fund Capital Stabilization Funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16514.814s">Dear</a>  President Bears and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that Your Honorable Body vote to appropriate free cash in the amount of $6 million into the General Stabilization Fund established earlier this year by Your Honorable Body. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16526.559s">As</a>  you know, the vast majority of cities and towns in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts have a General Stabilization Fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16531.201s">In</a>  order to provide for emergencies and unforeseen expenses, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16534.202s">a</a>  simple majority of the City Council is required to appropriate funds into a stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16539.184s">Further,</a>  in accordance with Chapter 40, Section 5b of the General Laws, I respect the request and recommend that Your Honorable Body take the following actions, each requiring a two-thirds majority vote of the City Council for establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16550.927s">One,</a>  establish a capital stabilization fund and vote to approve $5 million of free cash to this fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16556.729s">Two,</a>  establish a water and sewer capital stabilization fund <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16559.95s">and</a>  vote to appropriate $2 million of retained earnings to this fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16563.292s">As</a>  you are aware, free cash and retained earnings are only available after certification through June 30th of each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16568.674s">Each</a>  year without a stabilization fund, the city could face significant challenges in addressing emergencies or capital needs from July 1st until free cash is certified. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16576.718s">Chapter</a>  40, section 5B of the general law stipulates that, quote, cities, towns, and districts may create one or more stabilization funds and appropriate any amount to the funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16585.543s">The</a>  Division of Local Services, Financial Management Resource Bureau, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16588.684s">Notes</a>  in a published article, quote, a city or town's capital assets are a vital part of providing essential services to residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16595.049s">Capital</a>  assets include public buildings and structures, roadways, parks and fields, large equipment like dump trucks, mowers, fire engines, fire breathing apparatus, police cruisers, radio equipment, as well as land acquisitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16606.437s">Major</a>  repairs to a capital asset or when it needs to be replaced unexpectedly or reaches its expected useful life early can be a significant shock to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16614.523s">Additionally,</a>  deferred maintenance of capital needs, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16618.218s">Existing</a>  capital assets is a major contributor to capital failures, as these necessary upkeep costs are sometimes avoided in the interest of balancing the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16625.822s">One</a>  way to better prepare for capital expenditures, both planned and unexpected, is to establish a special purpose capital stabilization fund dedicated to funding regular required capital repairs and maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16635.548s">In</a>  close, please find a draft free cash plan for your review and input. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16638.57s">Thank</a>  you for your kind attention to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16640.07s">Respectfully</a>  submitted, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16643.152s">And</a>  in terms of the free cash plan, we have a free cash and retained earnings update. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16648.516s">Based</a>  on the unaudited balance sheet submitted, this is from the Department of Revenue Division of Local Services, notification of free cash approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16656.041s">I</a>  hereby certify that the amount of available funds for free cash as of July 1 for City of Medford is General Fund $34,241,981, Enterprise Fund Water and Sewer $11,164,741, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16671.492s">This</a>  certification is in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 59, Section 23 as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16676.617s">As</a>  per requests to the Council dated June 18, 2024, I am requesting the following funds be appropriated from free cash, $6 million General Stabilization Fund, $5 million Capital Stabilization Fund, $3 million Mass School Building Authority Feasibility Study, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16691.071s">for</a>  a total of $14 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16692.913s">The</a>  capital stabilization funding mentioned would be a source for fiscal 2024 and prior year capital improvement needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16699.32s">For</a>  the remaining funds, I anticipate the following future appropriation requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16703.084s">I</a>  welcome the Council's input on future appropriation requests before my office and the finance team work to finalize an initial roadmap for the funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16710.592s">$1</a>  million additional funding to renovate the Hegner Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16714.017s">2.5</a>  million fire department fleet replacements, 2 million pension liability, 2 million fiscal year 2025 capital improvements, 2 million fiscal year 2026 capital improvements, $9.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16727.779s">Please</a>  note that we do not anticipate future certifications to be as large as the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16732.141s">There</a>  are many factors that contribute to the balance in free cash today, including conservative estimating of revenues in pandemic years, vacancies in personnel positions, health insurance budget turnbacks, and the availability of ARPA funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16743.327s">While</a>  best practices still dictate that we should be somewhat conservative on revenue estimates, we push the envelope for fiscal 25 with our finance directors out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16750.37s">We're</a>  now able to process personal hires faster than we were able to in the past, and we are not expecting any health insurance turnbacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16756.315s">Instead,</a>  actuals are showing a deficit for fiscal 24, and the ability to appropriate ARPA funds ends December 31, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16763.701s">Finally,</a>  as the council may know, the Division of Local Services General Stabilization recommended goal is five to 7% of the current operating budget range. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16771.067s">For</a>  Medford, five to 7% of the fiscal 25 budget would be 9.47, between 9.47 and 13.26 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16779.333s">on</a>  funds certified for water sewer enterprise. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16781.596s">As</a>  the council knows, $2 million is proposed for a capital stabilization fund specifically for water and sewer, and the city is presently performing a water system analysis capital plan and rate study, which will help further inform the city in its planning efforts to address the aging water infrastructure across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16796.71s">Thank</a>  you for your kind attention to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16798.191s">Respectfully</a>  submitted, Reinaldo Kernmayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16801.074s">So</a>  right there, we're talking about $25 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16805.915s">sorry,</a>  $23.5 million of that $34 million going either to stabilization funds or specific projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16812.139s">There</a>  was a request for us to review an input on the free cash plan, so at some point we should discuss how we want to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16819.224s">And</a>  with that, I will go to Vice President Collins and then Chief of Staff Nazarian. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16823.887s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16825.328s">Thank</a>  you, President Pierce. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16831.988s">I</a>  want to preface by saying I haven't always been fully, in the past, I haven't felt fully comfortable with the volume of free cash that the city has amassed, but I think that this type of plan really puts data to the intuition that there's things, important, unskippable projects that this money is being saved and appropriated for, things that we do not have other sustainable ways of funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16858.757s">whether</a>  it's, you know, fleet replacements in the fire department, stabilization funds, which are essentially, you know, a piggy bank for the city in the same way that a person or a household has a savings bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16870.306s">Communities</a>  need them for the same reasons of responding to emergencies responsibly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16878.251s">liabilities</a>  for pensions and insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16881.713s">I</a>  think it's really helpful to have a draft of this plan for how this, you know, you just look at the number 25 million, 34 million now, you think, wow, that's a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16890.976s">Like,</a>  why, what are we sitting on that for? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16893.117s">And</a>  I think it's so important to have a draft plan for how it's going to be appropriated, because that number gets whittled down very, very quickly when we take stock of the <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16903.1s">stabilization</a>  funds that we ought to get in line with best practices in terms of how much we are saving for those rainy days and emergencies and for the major operating capital expenses that we need funding for that we're not going to fund out of our operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16918.243s">So</a>  I think that this is a great start. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16920.624s">I'm</a>  very happy to approve this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16923.324s">I</a>  would also want to put forward a B paper to schedule a committee of the whole to discuss the free cash plan in more detail with the council and with the administration.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16935.356s">On</a>  the, I'm just gonna put it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16937.337s">I'm</a>  gonna go to the Chief of Staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16938.218s">We</a>  have a B paper to schedule a committee of the whole with the administration to discuss the draft free cash plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16947.182s">And</a>  then Councilor Collins has also made a motion to approve the main paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16950.183s">Is</a>  there a second by Councilor Tseng? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16951.944s">A</a>  second by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16952.865s">I</a>  will go to Chief of Staff Nazarian, and then I will go to Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16956.567s">Madam</a>  Chief of Staff.</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16957.517s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears, members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16959.839s">I</a>  think the paper and its enclosure speaks for itself, and I appreciate the comments by Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16967.826s">I</a>  think the only thing that I'll say, and I think this is more for the community at large, as far as some more data points, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16980.888s">Essentially</a>  97% of communities have a general stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16985.931s">This</a>  council adopted a general stabilization fund earlier this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16990.954s">That</a>  was the first time the city of Medford went out of that 3% of communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16997.017s">And</a>  in addition to that, the statewide average balance in FY21, that's the data point that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17002.36s">I'm</a>  sure we could develop better data points because the <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17005.914s">state</a>  has a data bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17007.896s">I'm</a>  sure the council's aware of this, but again, these comments are mainly for the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17012.98s">The</a>  state publishes a data bank, which each community contributes data towards as a requirement under its reporting, where further and more up-to-date information can be acquired. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17025.031s">But</a>  the statewide average balance for this general stabilization fund was 6.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17031.796s">one</a>  5% according to the data point that I have that was a part of an article published by the division of local services. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17039.418s">You</a>  know, at this general stabilization fund proposed amount where we don't hit that average amount, but it is a beginning because we have to begin somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17048.88s">And</a>  it's, I think a very good beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17050.721s">And</a>  it's one that I believe that the city is overdue on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17056.262s">I</a>  have other pieces of information and data points. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17059.483s">I</a>  think a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17061.169s">.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17061.189s">I</a>  think the relevant aspects of those points have been already stated by members of the Council, so I'm not going to restate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17066.775s">I</a>  think the only further <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17074.426s">and</a>  retained earnings paper that we were really attempting to try to put all the thoughts that we've had in one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17082.492s">And</a>  it was to kind of accumulate things there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17086.074s">There</a>  are other elements and the ones that the council has discussed as well, like an accounting software that probably should be here too. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17093.219s">But</a>  again, we are asking for the council's input and we look forward to <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17097.122s">the</a>  information and thoughts that the council has to better improve this process and plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17100.965s">But</a>  as was stated by you, President Bears, this is a way to demonstrate that these dollars are very much needed and they're going to be very well utilized across the organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17112.072s">And</a>  again, I agree that <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17115.114s">These</a>  all the things that have been stated as to how these dollars came in to the city and how they cannot be used for reoccurring expenses, because we will get ourselves into a financial challenge in the future, not only with not only with the <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17133.905s">bond</a>  rating agencies, but in our own structural deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17137.209s">We</a>  don't want to dig ourselves into structural deficits again. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17139.793s">We</a>  are climbing out of those structural deficits. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17142.216s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17143.177s">I</a>  wanted to be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17144.319s">I'm</a>  happy to answer any further questions.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17147.283s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Chair and staff.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17149.261s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17150.482s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17150.862s">And</a>  Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17152.423s">Thank</a>  you, Chief of Staff Nazarian. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17154.604s">Agree</a>  or disagree with the specifics of the plan, I have to say it's really quite remarkable that in my time following it for politics, this is the first time I've seen a free cash plan laid out for the next few years like this in such a transparent manner, inviting us as a city council to take part in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17172.133s">I</a>  really appreciate that effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17174.214s">I</a>  think it really needs to be said. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17178.136s">I</a>  think the plan also exemplifies the fact that we are spending this on one-time expenses, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17185.581s">This</a>  is the sustainable way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17187.222s">I</a>  know Councilors have been reiterating that message all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17194.063s">It</a>  also highlights the fact that as much as I've advocated for using parts of it on recurring costs to cover one year, if we followed certain proposals, we would just be pushing the deadline, the cliff off by a year, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17209.576s">And</a>  we need to make difficult decisions now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17212.959s">Very</a>  shortly, I think there are two core lessons that we've been hearing tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17217.54s">These</a>  lessons are why I would support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17219.941s">The</a>  first one is being, you know, free cash should be used on one time expenses, rather than recurring because we can't count on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17227.145s">We</a>  can't count on the number for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17229.567s">The</a>  second lesson being that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17232.731s">free</a>  cash needs to be certified, and oftentimes that process can take many, many months, usually until the spring, but we can't say for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17241.073s">God</a>  forbid something awful happens in our city that we need that free cash for, we need to put money into the Stable Legislation Fund for us to take, to be able to cover that expense, for us to fix that problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17252.237s">And</a>  if we don't vote this through tonight, we don't have that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17254.657s">So</a>  that problem could be left, we could be left out to dry for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17261.989s">And</a>  I think one additional note for the city council is that this actually gives us more say in how the money is spent as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17270.592s">When</a>  we take money from the stabilization fund, the city council will have to approve that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17274.314s">And</a>  I think that gives us an additional level of oversight that we haven't had before. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17278.035s">So</a>  I'm in support of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17279.536s">That's</a>  why I seconded both the BPAPE and the paper.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17285.35s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17285.99s">Any</a>  other questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17287.331s">We</a>  probably should divide the question on the main paper I have to go to Councilor Callahan, Councilor Callahan my apologies.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17292.895s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17294.416s">And</a>  thanks for, for all the work that you guys have done to put together these proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17301.08s">I</a>  wanted to ask a little bit about the capital stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17307.176s">whether</a>  with the general stabilization fund, if that way that it is set up through the recommendations of the state, if that can be spent on capital, if the point of having a separate capital stabilization fund is to <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17331.818s">limit</a>  the ways that those funds can be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17336.542s">I'm</a>  trying to get to sort of why establish a capital stabilization fund separately from the general stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17344.669s">And</a>  by the way, I am really glad that we're establishing a water and sewer capital stabilization fund, which we desperately need. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17351.855s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17352.195s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Kelly and Councilor, Chief of Staff Nazarian.</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17357.503s">Thank</a>  you very much, President Beres, through you to Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17360.365s">I</a>  think the most succinct way for me to be able to respond to the question by you, Councilor Callahan, is to kind of go through some language that exists in, again, the Division of Local Services and their publications. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17376.418s">They</a>  specifically write as to general stabilization funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17380.962s">that</a>  communities established general stabilization funds as reserve accounts to provide emergency funds for use in major or significant events, such as a natural disaster and uninsured loss damage to a capital asset and it goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17395.753s">Specifically</a>  as to the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17397.454s">It's</a>  really, it's really, it's creating two separate funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17404.457s">really</a>  is an intention to show that the General Stabilization Fund are for the items that I just reviewed, and the Capital Stabilization Fund would be for capital-related projects, equipment and maintenance, and not intended to be things that would dip into the General Stabilization Fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17424.582s">Hopefully</a>  I've answered the question that you had, and the goal would be, obviously, to <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17432.17s">maintain</a>  a capital stabilization fund that meets the city's needs into the longer term. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17437.673s">But</a>  this is, again, another piece of a beginning part of the puzzle.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17443.576s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Chief of Staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17447.218s">Any</a>  further questions or comments on the creation of these stabilization funds and the appropriation of free cash funds to them?</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17455.783s">Yeah,</a>  I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17456.984s">Can</a>  I just do a short follow-up question? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17460.156s">Do</a>  you have any data on how many municipalities or the percentage of municipalities that also have a capital stabilization fund?</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17471.223s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17473.064s">Through</a>  you to Councilor Callahan, I have some information and data as of approximately April of 2022 that states that at that time, the number of communities with at least one specific purpose stabilization fund had grown over the last five years at that time from 15% to close to 40%. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17493.641s">I</a>  don't have the specific data as to how many communities right now have a capital stabilization fund, but I could certainly get back to the Council on that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17500.643s">But</a>  about in April 22 is 40%. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17502.164s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17502.424s">And</a>  that includes towns of 100 and your tollens and your Florida's and your, I suspect, but yes, all 351 cities and towns.</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17513.593s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17514.054s">Across</a>  those. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17514.614s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17515.795s">Any</a>  further questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17516.496s">Councilor</a>  Calhoun?</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17519.879s">Um,</a>  I don't think so.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17522.461s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17523.834s">All</a>  right, we'll take the B paper first. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17526.115s">On</a>  the B paper by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng, Madam Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17533.596s">And</a>  there will probably be four votes on this paper.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17535.457s">I</a>  apologize, could you re-read the B motion, please?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17541.498s">Sorry,</a>  yes, the re-paper motion, Councilor Callahan, is that we hold a committee of the whole with the administration to discuss and review the draft free cash plan.</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17885.133s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17886.574s">To</a>  you and members of the council, it's my understanding that the school committee voted yesterday evening to approve this by majority. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17894.881s">It's</a>  my understanding it was a 5-2 vote of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17899.025s">The</a>  objective here is to use the acceptance of the statute to be able to utilize support on both city and school side where it makes sense, where it's practical. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17910.729s">And</a>  so that's the simple nature of the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17914.851s">If</a>  the council approves this ultimately, then the city and school departments can continue discussion on potentially instituting resources from either side of the organization to support the other side of the organization where it makes practical sense to do so based on the various circumstances of each concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17935.059s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17936.579s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17936.879s">Any</a>  questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17937.6s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17939.292s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17940.013s">Thank</a>  you for presenting on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17941.935s">I'm</a>  heartened to hear that the school committee already took a vote to approve this, not just because that's a step towards manifesting it, but also, you know, I would look to them to get the body's opinion on if this is a worthwhile endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17954.407s">And</a>  it means a lot to me that the school committee, you know, the majority of them thought that this was <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17960.239s">worth</a>  moving forward and, you know, this does not, in my understanding, passage of this does not automatically, of course, it doesn't automatically consolidate any functions between the city and the schools department. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17972.602s">What</a>  it does is it allows us to have those discussions about what functions might be advantageous to consolidate, might help us <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17980.684s">streamline</a>  things that both the cities and Metro Public Schools are doing might help us save money on things that we're currently doing in two places, would allow us to have those discussions and then be able to act on them if we come to decisions that some departments are worth combining. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17995.467s">So</a>  I will be happy to approve this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17998.048s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18000.448s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18002.549s">Any</a>  further questions?</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18021.654s">I</a>  would say that there are preliminary conversations that have been had, and I think there have been discussions as to certain departments that the city side could support potentially on the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18036.001s">They</a>  are very preliminary in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18038.182s">I'd</a>  be happy to speak with any counselor about it on the side, but I don't want to get out too far ahead of the conversations and put any party in a position that makes it challenging for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18050.792s">I</a>  open the door for any councilor to contact me and I'm happy to speak to anyone and I'm happy to speak with the councilor.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18057.115s">Yes,</a>  and just from some discussions that I've had, my understanding is one of those areas would be facilities maintenance planning, which we have a need for and issues with across the city historically for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18071.622s">And</a>  so that's something I have heard talked about, but hopefully further discussion would be happening on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18079.656s">All</a>  right, Councilor Callahan, I see your hand raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18092.0s">All</a>  right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18093.447s">We</a>  will go to Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18276.462s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18277.523s">Just</a>  to comment on the items you brought up, the facilities expenses largely were utilities expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18283.567s">As</a>  far as workers' comp salaries, it's just workers' compensation claims that were approved by our third-party workers' compensation organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18292.954s">And</a>  you've already touched on the insurance expenses, but I'm happy to go into any further detail on any of those.</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18353.519s">Yes,</a>  those are my recollections. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18355.521s">I</a>  would probably benefit from looking at the facilities budget again, because we would have liked to increase it even further, but as the council knows, but that is exactly my recollection as well.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18366.229s">Well,</a>  at least we will be able to do that before free cash is certified next year, because we have a stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18375.899s">All</a>  right, on the motion of Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Leming, to approve the fiscal year 24 end of year transfers, 24-433. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18384.805s">Yes,</a>  and it looks like we do have Councilor Callahan back, so we'll try that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18392.67s">Madam</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18878.233s">Council</a>  is our um, thank you for presenting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18883.877s">Um,</a>  I <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18886.61s">agree</a>  with what Vice President Collins said. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18889.612s">I</a>  just wanted to say that it is a difficult thing to present, especially after a decade of no cost of living increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18906.662s">It's</a>  difficult as a <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18912.054s">head</a>  of a city to propose that you give yourself a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18916.738s">The</a>  reason I am in favor of this is because our current mayor will not be our current mayor forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18924.804s">And</a>  it's the same reason that I was in favor of the raises for our school committee members, which is that every subsequent person that will <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18936.055s">become</a>  the mayor will have to live on a salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18939.836s">And</a>  we can't have that position only available to people who are able to live on a salary that is not a living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18952.638s">It</a>  precludes people who are not independently wealthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18957.219s">So</a>  if the person who would like to run for mayor at some future time, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18966.496s">they</a>  will need to live in Medford, they will need to be able to afford it, and this is what will be required. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18971.018s">So</a>  going forward, we'll have to make these adjustments. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18976.741s">This</a>  is just what we have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18979.395s">And</a>  I appreciate the willingness to put that forward for now and for everybody who will hold these positions in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18988.021s">It's</a>  challenging because it feels weird, but it's something that we have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18992.524s">So</a>  I'm in support of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18993.584s">And</a>  as Vice President Collins said, I'm also in favor of giving people raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18999.868s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19001.329s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19005.427s">Part</a>  of this that gives me pause is the fact that Medford, the mayor's chair of the school committee and so I mean I know that that's two different positions but by two legally different positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19018.554s">I,</a>  yeah, I, I know but the. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19024.183s">it</a>  could change if the charter changes, but effectively the person who is occupying both the position as mayor and the position as head of the school committee in Medford are the same person. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19039.517s">And</a>  so the chair of the school committee did get a raise already. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19047.964s">And</a>  so that's, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19050.649s">That's</a>  I'd say that I'd say that that's the part that that's that's the one part of this that does give me that does give me some pause the logic of having not received an increase in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19062.985s">10</a>  years, that does make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19066.329s">But</a>  the person who is essentially doing the job that they have done that whole time has received a raise that we approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19078.762s">So</a>  that's the only part of this that I'm questioning right now.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19088.86s">Any</a>  further comments, Councilor Tseng? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19091.243s">I</a>  have to say I'm still making my mind up, but to your point, if you're thinking about it that way, then we should recognize that the raised cost for the school committee is basically just a little bit over 2% over those last almost 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19103.055s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19108.115s">it's</a>  off of a baseline that's much smaller, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19111.319s">And</a>  so it's still 2%, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19114.061s">And</a>  she's still doing whoever the mayor is, the mayor, whoever serves in that position is still doing those two legally separate roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19121.69s">So</a>  if you're thinking about it like that, I would just urge you to <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19126.369s">use</a>  that logic to apply if I don't know if I'm making sense to you, but I'm just saying the baseline, the base number is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19134.271s">And</a>  so, you know, whilst we can say that the chair of the school committee did receive a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19142.901s">we</a>  should think of that as separate from the mayoral role, because they are just two completely separate entities with two completely different salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19154.328s">I'm</a>  just putting that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19155.229s">I'm</a>  still making my mind up on it, but if I'm understanding your line of thinking, I would urge you to think that way as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19163.474s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19164.054s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19166.235s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19166.636s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19169.901s">I</a>  guess I have a second, I hesitate on two points. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19175.625s">One</a>  is that I think that the cost of living in Medford is going up more than 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19183.61s">So</a>  for non-union employees, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19190.967s">you</a>  know, my general understanding of salaries in Medford is that they are across the board too low. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19197.269s">And</a>  I do look forward to us receiving and reviewing the overview of how we compare to nearby cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19210.952s">But,</a>  you know, I mean, I'm happy to give a raise, but I also hesitate to give <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19218.056s">This</a>  to me is not a raise, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19219.437s">It's</a>  clearly not a raise, it's a COLA. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19221.959s">But</a>  even at a COLA, I would like to see us being commensurate with other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19232.487s">And</a>  then secondly, also, I'm not totally convinced that <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19241.445s">As</a>  well, looking, you know, I, I probably should spend a little time reviewing mayor salaries and nearby cities of similar size and all those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19253.011s">I</a>  don't think you simply say it's 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19255.052s">I</a>  also don't think that the <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19258.514s">current</a>  pay of the person who sits in the mayor's chair, given the two positions that they are legally required to sit in, and the pay that they get from both of those is not a living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19269.878s">I</a>  don't think that can be argued. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19272.959s">So</a>  I do have two points of hesitation on this one.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19276.42s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19280.341s">Any</a>  further questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19284.428s">We</a>  have a motion on the floor from Vice President Collins to approve with no exclusions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19289.994s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19295.32s">Seeing</a>  no further questions, I will go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19299.705s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19300.726s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>
