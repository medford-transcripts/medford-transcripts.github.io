[SPEAKER_21]: Resolution celebrating Tom Lincoln's service as Brooks Estate President.

23
00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:53,458
[SPEAKER_21]: Whereas Tom Lincoln has served as President of the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust and Belt since its founding and

24
00:07:54,099 --> 00:08:01,122
[SPEAKER_21]: Whereas Tom Lincoln led the efforts for the permanent preservation and conservation of the Medford Brooks estate, including both the historic buildings and open space.

25
00:08:01,702 --> 00:08:16,149
[SPEAKER_21]: And whereas Tom Lincoln has volunteered tens of thousands of hours to Medford over the past 30 years, helping to draft legislation to establish M-BELT, run hundreds of meetings and events, recruit volunteers, raise funds, write grants, and be the public face of M-BELT to the Medford and regional community.

26
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:23,172
[SPEAKER_21]: And whereas after decades of service, Tom Lincoln recently stepped down as M-BELT president and has returned to the ranks of volunteers and citizen advocates,

27
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:32,858
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we congratulate Tom Lincoln on his storied career, preserving and restoring this essential city-owned property for future generations.

28
00:08:33,318 --> 00:08:39,161
[SPEAKER_21]: Be it further resolved that we invite Mr. Lincoln to attend a future city council meeting to present him with a citation for his achievement.

30
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:48,187

32
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:55,305
[SPEAKER_21]: community and to celebrate Tom Lincoln's work to preserve and conserve the Medford Brooks estate for all time.

33
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,970
[SPEAKER_21]: Any comments by members of the council?

34
00:08:58,791 --> 00:08:59,433
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lemme.

35
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like to say that

36
00:09:04,115 --> 00:09:12,540
[SPEAKER_11]: When I was a member of the CPA, Tom Lincoln, he was one of our frequent customers.

37
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:22,945
[SPEAKER_11]: He just brought in application after application to repair the Brooks Estate, and he's the driving force behind the upkeep of that property today.

38
00:09:22,985 --> 00:09:24,986
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just a case of an

39
00:09:26,707 --> 00:09:36,935
[SPEAKER_11]: ordinary citizen of Medford, seeing something that they wanted preserved, seeing a project that they could really get behind, and putting their time and energy into it.

40
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:38,717
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's really paid off.

41
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:47,924
[SPEAKER_11]: I look forward to telling Mr. Lincoln how much I admire him when he does come to the next city council meeting.

42
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations, Mr. Lincoln.

43
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:52,488
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a great citizen.

44
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:52,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

45
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:55,130
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further comment?

46
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,071
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

47
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,470
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, President Bears.

48
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:05,014
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it's one thing to take a stroll through the Brooks Park, you know, by oneself or with friends or with family.

49
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:10,977
[SPEAKER_29]: It's another to get a personal tour from Mr. Lincoln, which I was very lucky to do when I first took office.

50
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:16,880
[SPEAKER_29]: And it really is incredible hearing that kind of layers deep history of all of the work

51
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:32,874
[SPEAKER_29]: volunteer work, community work, just layers of investment that go into making this really such a jewel in the community, the outdoor space, the historic preservation that the community gets to enjoy more and more every year as the renovation continues to go on.

52
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:44,023
[SPEAKER_29]: So my heartfelt thanks to Mr. Lincoln, you know, really an incredible, an incredible legacy to leave in Medford, to leave the Brooks Park estate so improved.

53
00:10:44,364 --> 00:10:44,584
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

54
00:10:46,377 --> 00:10:47,037
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Tseng.

55
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:47,918
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

56
00:10:48,618 --> 00:10:54,100
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Lincoln's efforts, I think, have really put the Brooks Estate on the map in Medford.

57
00:10:54,961 --> 00:11:07,406
[SPEAKER_18]: His work, people don't see it, but behind the scenes, he's spending so much time going to events, informing people about MBEL, about the Brooks Estate, giving tours to counselors, giving tours to the public.

58
00:11:08,027 --> 00:11:13,309
[SPEAKER_18]: His work, I think, will be dearly missed by, and the next person will have huge shoes to pull.

59
00:11:15,796 --> 00:11:16,917
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

60
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,538
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

61
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,201
[SPEAKER_16]: Every community should have a Tom Lincoln.

62
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:31,149
[SPEAKER_16]: I admire Tom for his conviction of what he believes in, and Tom was the person that fought for what he believed in.

63
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:39,956
[SPEAKER_16]: And if anybody wants to know why the Brooks Estates is still standing and why it's still a great piece of our community, it's because of Tom Lincoln.

64
00:11:41,337 --> 00:11:47,420
[SPEAKER_16]: So I can't wait to see him and shake his hand and thank him because he put a lot of time and effort.

65
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:55,824
[SPEAKER_16]: There are many, many nights that we would butt heads and not agree, but we would always respect each other.

66
00:11:57,185 --> 00:11:59,706
[SPEAKER_16]: And I admire what he did for our community.

67
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,107
[SPEAKER_16]: And hopefully someone's ready to pick up that torch.

68
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:04,248
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you, Tom.

69
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:06,630
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

70
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:15,874
[SPEAKER_21]: And I have been lucky to serve now for five years as the City Council's representative on the MBELT board and work with Tom.

71
00:12:16,455 --> 00:12:24,459
[SPEAKER_21]: And Tom's tenacity, his experiences, frustration with the pace of change are all something that I've come

72
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:29,668
[SPEAKER_21]: to know very well, and I am excited to thank him and congratulate him.

73
00:12:29,688 --> 00:12:35,569
[SPEAKER_21]: He is going to keep working with the Brooks Estate and on the Brooks Estate, which I think is fantastic.

74
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:51,432
[SPEAKER_21]: We also have a new president, Carly Nesson, a Medford resident who stepped up to take on the role, and we're really excited to see what the next 30 years at the Brooks Estate looks like as we hope to finalize the master plan that was started 10 years ago.

75
00:12:52,172 --> 00:13:05,241
[SPEAKER_21]: Much of it has been done in terms of the restoration of the building, and now it is time to build the access drive, finish the restoration, and make sure that everyone in every part of Medford can access the wonderful open space that is the Brooks Estate.

76
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:08,063
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you all for your comments.

77
00:13:08,143 --> 00:13:11,446
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure Tom appreciates them, and is there a motion?

78
00:13:13,507 --> 00:13:16,850
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion approved by Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Collins.

79
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,651
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

80
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:21,145
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

81
00:13:21,165 --> 00:13:21,245
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

82
00:13:21,345 --> 00:13:21,585
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

83
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:21,806
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

84
00:13:22,286 --> 00:13:22,546
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes.

85
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:43,699
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, seven from the affirmative and the negative, the motion passes.

86
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:55,881
[SPEAKER_21]: 24-430, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we congratulate Sylvia de Placido on her retirement as assistant city clerk and thank her for her decades of public service to the city of Medford.

87
00:13:56,521 --> 00:14:01,042
[SPEAKER_21]: Before I go to councilors, I do have a statement from the city clerk who could not be here tonight.

88
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:06,983
[SPEAKER_21]: He didn't know when he made plans that Sylvia would be retiring, so he's traveling, but he did want to say something.

89
00:14:09,397 --> 00:14:13,858
[SPEAKER_21]: He said, inside room 103, I am the city clerk, but Sylvia is the boss.

90
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,319
[SPEAKER_21]: Capitalized.

91
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:20,220
[SPEAKER_21]: Even though I am a Springsteen fan of more than four decades, Sylvia is still the boss.

92
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:24,562
[SPEAKER_21]: She gave this city 32 years of selfless, dedicated service.

93
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:31,464
[SPEAKER_21]: If we count Dorothy Donahue's tenure as acting city clerk, and we should, then Sylvia has worked with four different city clerks, beginning with Joe McGonigal.

94
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:34,105
[SPEAKER_21]: She knows everything there is to know about the city clerk's office.

95
00:14:34,185 --> 00:14:37,506
[SPEAKER_21]: She's our living encyclopedia for literally everything our office touches.

96
00:14:38,306 --> 00:14:39,526
[SPEAKER_21]: Sylvia leads by example.

97
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:43,788
[SPEAKER_21]: Behind her seemingly gruff exterior is one of the kindest, funniest people we will ever know.

98
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:48,549
[SPEAKER_21]: Sylvia's patience and humor have pulled our entire team through some particularly challenging times.

99
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:51,190
[SPEAKER_21]: She has been an incredible teacher and mentor.

100
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:57,732
[SPEAKER_21]: She is completely unafraid to tell me what I need to know, when and how I need to know it, in words that are unequivocal and easy to comprehend.

101
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:01,173
[SPEAKER_21]: She is constitutionally incapable of sugarcoating anything.

102
00:15:02,062 --> 00:15:03,202
[SPEAKER_21]: These are virtues.

103
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:08,104
[SPEAKER_21]: I will miss Sylvia's daily presence, but she's about to find out that she's only a phone call away.

104
00:15:08,664 --> 00:15:11,945
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm thrilled for her as she embarks on her hard-earned, well-deserved retirement.

105
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:19,167
[SPEAKER_21]: My hope for her is nothing but happiness and more priceless time on the lake with Peter, Michael, Peter, Mark, and her beloved grandchildren.

106
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:20,447
[SPEAKER_21]: Well done, boss.

107
00:15:20,747 --> 00:15:21,908
[SPEAKER_21]: Well done, and thank you.

108
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,108
[SPEAKER_21]: It bears repeating.

109
00:15:47,102 --> 00:16:03,049
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's say some nice things So we have known your family a long time and I just want to commend you and thank you and

110
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:07,183
[SPEAKER_16]: It's people like Sylvia that kept Medford moving.

111
00:16:07,783 --> 00:16:19,491
[SPEAKER_16]: I know people think today's times might be a little difficult, but I remember some really tough times in Medford, and it's the people that made this building what it was and what it is.

112
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:32,980
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's people like yourself that I personally am gonna miss, and it's like, I think that it's a piece of history that'll be walking out the door, but at the same time, you left a legacy here that I hope

113
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,803
[SPEAKER_16]: everybody would follow because you've done an amazing job for our citizens.

114
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:48,692
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know that this is going to sound bad, but I know you get paid every week and not a lot, but what you gave to us is priceless and we thank you so much.

115
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:52,575
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you for everything you've done for the city and enjoy retirement.

116
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:56,318
[SPEAKER_20]: Vice president Collins.

117
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:58,201
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, President Bears.

118
00:16:59,682 --> 00:17:02,903
[SPEAKER_29]: Sylvia, thank you so much for so many years of service.

119
00:17:03,164 --> 00:17:04,564
[SPEAKER_29]: Congratulations on your retirement.

120
00:17:05,845 --> 00:17:08,846
[SPEAKER_29]: It is really hard to imagine the clerk's office without you.

121
00:17:09,786 --> 00:17:19,811
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think about the moments in my life in Medford that you have been there for when I filed for a business permit, when I pulled papers for the first time, when I took my first oath of office.

122
00:17:19,931 --> 00:17:26,414
[SPEAKER_29]: And I know there's so many people doing things that really contribute to the fabric of Medford, whether it's business permits or virtual licenses.

123
00:17:28,055 --> 00:17:33,618
[SPEAKER_29]: you know, applying for various things in the city of Medford, they have to go through you and your colleagues.

124
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:43,525
[SPEAKER_29]: And you've been such an integral part of what that experience is like, of people trying to shape their life in various ways, shape their contributions to Medford in various ways.

125
00:17:43,885 --> 00:17:46,847
[SPEAKER_29]: And what an incredible role to inhabit for so many years.

126
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,888
[SPEAKER_29]: So my thanks go out to you.

127
00:17:49,028 --> 00:17:55,333
[SPEAKER_29]: I think 32 years of public service really tells you a lot about a person and how they choose to live their life in service to their community.

128
00:17:56,474 --> 00:17:59,757
[SPEAKER_29]: I wish you only the very best for a very long and happy retirement.

[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

133
00:18:05,202 --> 00:18:09,207
[SPEAKER_18]: I really can't beat the city clerk's words, but

134
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:14,928
[SPEAKER_18]: Sylvia, I think you're the person I think of when I think of the clerk's office.

135
00:18:15,088 --> 00:18:16,409
[SPEAKER_18]: You've been there since day dot.

136
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:26,456
[SPEAKER_18]: And when I walk in and I see your smile and I see you at your desk, it really lifts my mood in my day, no matter how a meeting in City Hall has gone that day.

137
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:34,920
[SPEAKER_18]: go on, you know, family trips, I always make sure to bring something small back for the clerk's office.

138
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,583
[SPEAKER_18]: And I always think that would still be appreciated.

139
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:41,847
[SPEAKER_18]: You truly are the bedrock of the clerk's office.

140
00:18:42,008 --> 00:18:45,611
[SPEAKER_18]: I've heard it said that the clerk's office is like the front desk.

141
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,132
[SPEAKER_18]: for City Hall.

142
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:50,594
[SPEAKER_18]: So many people interact with the clerk's office.

143
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:56,717
[SPEAKER_18]: So many people come to you and ask questions about where to go in City Hall, where to find services.

144
00:18:57,318 --> 00:19:01,700
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're always there with a smiling face day after day, helping our residents.

145
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:10,904
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that service, that long career of service to our residents should really be highly esteemed and really highly celebrated.

146
00:19:15,006 --> 00:19:15,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Leming.

147
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:16,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

148
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Just keep mine short and I'll say Sylvia, we love you.

149
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:21,626
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll miss you.

150
00:19:21,646 --> 00:19:27,975
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll miss your humor and your presence in the clerk's office.

151
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:28,696
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that

152
00:19:29,844 --> 00:19:49,877
[SPEAKER_11]: The clerks often get enough credit for all the work that they do behind the scenes and all the institutional knowledge that they bring to City Council and City Hall and the help either just with purely procedural stuff or just with moral support when we've had a rough evening.

153
00:19:51,318 --> 00:19:53,219
[SPEAKER_11]: And Sylvia will be dearly missed.

154
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,562
[SPEAKER_11]: That being said, enjoy retirement.

155
00:19:57,242 --> 00:19:57,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good time.

156
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:58,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

157
00:20:00,882 --> 00:20:06,930
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you and just I want to say congratulations and your service has been so appreciated.

158
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:23,089
[SPEAKER_21]: And my three terms, my first term, I didn't get to know as well because you were in here and many of us were not in this building during the pandemic, but you were here with the clerk's team processing birth certificates, marriages, death certificates.

159
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:32,352
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it is the basics of civic life that run through our clerk's office, nevermind council agendas, which may not be the basics, but there's something.

160
00:20:35,086 --> 00:21:00,802
[SPEAKER_21]: since I've been vice president, now president, especially this past couple of years, I've spent a lot of time in the clerk's office and I've appreciated your humor, your welcoming me and pointing out that I may be sitting at the desk too much and shouldn't be an honorary member of the clerk's team as often, but always made me feel welcome and always tried to feed me candy and cookies, which,

161
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:03,924
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate and my doctor regrets.

162
00:21:04,044 --> 00:21:15,011
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's been a real joy to spend time with you, Sylvia, and to get to know you and to see the end of many years of service, just the last tail end.

163
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:20,474
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't get to see the first 26 years, but the last few have been a privilege.

164
00:21:20,554 --> 00:21:21,775
[SPEAKER_21]: So congratulations.

165
00:21:22,195 --> 00:21:24,977
[SPEAKER_21]: Enjoy the pontoon boat with the family.

166
00:21:25,357 --> 00:21:27,458
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'll miss having you here too.

167
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:30,440
[SPEAKER_21]: When Adam wasn't here, it's been great to chair meetings with you.

168
00:21:31,772 --> 00:21:32,112
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

169
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:38,295
[SPEAKER_21]: Would anyone from the public like to speak on this item?

170
00:21:38,535 --> 00:21:40,676
[SPEAKER_21]: You can come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

171
00:21:44,478 --> 00:21:47,499
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, Madam Clerk, please.

172
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:48,800
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I need a motion first.

173
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,500
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there a motion?

174
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,421
[SPEAKER_28]: Motion to approve.

175
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:54,602
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion to approve by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

176
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:57,164
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Callahan?

177
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:57,624
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

178
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,481
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Collins?

179
00:22:00,661 --> 00:22:00,921
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

180
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:03,322
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Lazzaro?

181
00:22:03,382 --> 00:22:03,642
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

182
00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:05,243
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Leming?

183
00:22:05,484 --> 00:22:05,704
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

184
00:22:06,764 --> 00:22:07,785
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Scarpelli?

185
00:22:07,965 --> 00:22:08,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

186
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:09,666
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Tseng?

187
00:22:09,706 --> 00:22:09,866
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

188
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:11,507
[SPEAKER_39]: President Bears?

189
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:12,047
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

190
00:22:12,348 --> 00:22:13,748
[SPEAKER_21]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

191
00:22:13,768 --> 00:22:14,549
[SPEAKER_21]: The motion passes.

192
00:22:25,614 --> 00:22:35,820
[SPEAKER_21]: 24-431, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we congratulate Janice DePace on her retirement as principal clerk and thank her for her decades of public service to the city of Medford.

193
00:22:38,802 --> 00:22:39,662
[SPEAKER_21]: Go to councilors.

194
00:22:40,783 --> 00:22:42,003
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

195
00:22:46,161 --> 00:22:55,023
[SPEAKER_29]: It's a happy day to get to congratulate two, you know, two civil servants with such incredible longevity and a history of so many years of contribution to our city.

196
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:59,525
[SPEAKER_29]: To be able to congratulate two on retirement in just one evening is really a happy thing.

197
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:15,809
[SPEAKER_29]: It's also a little bittersweet to say goodbye to two members, you know, two contributors to City Hall who have been so present for so many years, been of service to this council and to the community, you know, in ways personal and professional for such a long time.

198
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,430
[SPEAKER_29]: Janice, congratulations.

199
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,412
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you so much for your many years of hard work.

200
00:23:21,392 --> 00:23:25,495
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you for, you know, bringing not only your hard work, but your personality to this city hall.

201
00:23:26,895 --> 00:23:31,958
[SPEAKER_29]: We're sad to see you go, but again, best wishes for a joyful and long retirement.

202
00:23:32,158 --> 00:23:32,479
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

203
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:34,340
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

204
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,040
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Tseng.

205
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:35,901
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

206
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:39,443
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Councilor Collins really got at it by, you know,

207
00:23:40,205 --> 00:23:52,472
[SPEAKER_18]: talking about how bittersweet it is to both celebrate the retirements of two lovely individuals, but also, you know, how much, you know, we'll miss after.

208
00:23:53,452 --> 00:23:58,175
[SPEAKER_18]: Janice is, you know, one of those people who really has helped keep the clerk's office running.

209
00:23:58,595 --> 00:24:07,159
[SPEAKER_18]: She's really, you know, as Councilor Scarpaoli said in the last statement, the clerk's office has really been,

210
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:12,130
[SPEAKER_18]: the engines have been in gear through thick and thin.

211
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:17,931
[SPEAKER_18]: And Janice is a big reason why we've been able to keep moving forward as a city.

212
00:24:18,571 --> 00:24:24,693
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm so deeply grateful to Janice and to her service for all of our residents.

213
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:26,733
[SPEAKER_18]: Truly, she does so much.

214
00:24:27,473 --> 00:24:35,175
[SPEAKER_18]: Our clerks team is so remarkable and I'm gonna be very sad to miss both Janice and Sylvia.

215
00:24:39,142 --> 00:24:40,003
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

216
00:24:40,523 --> 00:24:44,546
[SPEAKER_16]: Janice DePace, I've known Janice for a long time.

217
00:24:45,347 --> 00:24:56,435
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember her children participating in sports, and I remember teaching with Janice while she was at Medford High School, and now she's...

218
00:24:58,795 --> 00:24:59,996
[SPEAKER_16]: on to bigger and better things.

219
00:25:00,056 --> 00:25:01,156
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm so excited for her.

220
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:02,296
[SPEAKER_16]: She's just a great person.

221
00:25:02,837 --> 00:25:09,539
[SPEAKER_16]: If you know Janice DePace, she has a smile on her face and a special word for you just to keep, just to make sure you have a great day.

222
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,020
[SPEAKER_16]: And she was like that with her students.

223
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,221
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that everybody that crossed her path.

224
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:20,644
[SPEAKER_16]: So she'll be missing the clerk's office, but she's earned an amazing retirement.

225
00:25:20,664 --> 00:25:22,004
[SPEAKER_16]: So congratulations, my friend.

226
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:25,586
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

227
00:25:25,606 --> 00:25:27,947
[SPEAKER_21]: Now I'm gonna read from the clerk about Janice.

228
00:25:32,793 --> 00:25:34,695
[SPEAKER_21]: Janice does a little of everything in our office.

229
00:25:34,775 --> 00:25:40,900
[SPEAKER_21]: She brought vast knowledge and experience with her when she came to City Hall from the schools, and she has transformed operations for our team.

230
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:48,047
[SPEAKER_21]: She has been a go-to resource for businesses, dog owners, restaurants, retail establishments, and anybody who needs information related to city government.

231
00:25:48,627 --> 00:25:52,429
[SPEAKER_21]: Speaking of go-to resources, she's been a go-to resource for everybody at City Hall.

232
00:25:52,870 --> 00:26:03,877
[SPEAKER_21]: She arrived at the clerk's office with a large network of teachers and former students, all of whom she remembers by name, when they arrive in Room 103 for copies of their birth certificates, to file their marriage intentions, and to renew their dog licenses.

233
00:26:04,517 --> 00:26:06,799
[SPEAKER_21]: and all of whom remember her by name with kind words as well.

234
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,802
[SPEAKER_21]: Janice nails our customer service mission every single day, leading with kindness.

235
00:26:11,323 --> 00:26:18,869
[SPEAKER_21]: She has passion for her job, combined with skills that can't be taught in any training session, along with a cosmetology license for anybody who might need a quick cut or trim.

236
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,692
[SPEAKER_21]: She enjoys our customers and her colleagues, and they enjoy her.

237
00:26:22,772 --> 00:26:25,434
[SPEAKER_21]: She leaves City Hall with many years of service to our city and our residents.

238
00:26:25,935 --> 00:26:28,917
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm grateful for the work that she's done and for her friendship, commitment, and humor.

239
00:26:29,438 --> 00:26:31,439
[SPEAKER_21]: She has made our city a better place in which to live and work.

240
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,461
[SPEAKER_21]: I wish her the best on her next adventure.

241
00:26:36,175 --> 00:26:44,521
[SPEAKER_21]: And I will just say to Janice that it has also been a privilege to serve and see her service in the clerk's office.

242
00:26:46,082 --> 00:26:50,546
[SPEAKER_21]: Similarly to Sylvia, Janice has always made me feel welcome in the office.

243
00:26:51,466 --> 00:26:55,990
[SPEAKER_21]: We always have a story to exchange or a bit of news to share.

244
00:26:57,231 --> 00:27:02,475
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think especially something to say is, I think it's both a testament to their

245
00:27:04,144 --> 00:27:11,187
[SPEAKER_21]: being great colleagues and friends, but also a loss at the same time that Janice and Sylvia get to go out together.

246
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,628
[SPEAKER_21]: They both get to retire luckily at the same time.

247
00:27:14,648 --> 00:27:20,470
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think maybe neither of them could have imagined serving without the other in the office.

248
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:28,954
[SPEAKER_21]: So they both have dedicated so many years of service and are able to step out into their retirement or their next adventure.

249
00:27:30,134 --> 00:27:31,835
[SPEAKER_21]: together, and I think that's a beautiful story.

250
00:27:32,055 --> 00:27:34,776
[SPEAKER_21]: So, with that, is there a motion on the floor?

251
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:40,098
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion by councilor saying to approve, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

252
00:27:41,138 --> 00:27:42,099
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Callahan?

[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

254
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:45,760

[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,081

257
00:27:48,181 --> 00:27:48,421
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

260
00:27:51,602 --> 00:27:52,702
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Scarpelli?

261
00:27:52,843 --> 00:27:53,023
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

262
00:27:53,683 --> 00:27:54,483
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Tseng?

263
00:27:54,543 --> 00:27:54,703
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

264
00:27:56,004 --> 00:27:56,644
[SPEAKER_39]: President Bears?

265
00:27:56,784 --> 00:27:57,044
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

266
00:27:57,064 --> 00:27:58,445
[SPEAKER_21]: Seven in the affirmative, none of the negative.

267
00:27:58,465 --> 00:27:59,225
[SPEAKER_21]: The motion passes.

268
00:28:01,495 --> 00:28:03,378
[SPEAKER_21]: 24-419 offered by Councilor Tseng.

269
00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:06,342
[SPEAKER_21]: Resolution congratulating Donna Lasky on her retirement.

270
00:28:06,443 --> 00:28:15,797
[SPEAKER_21]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Donna Lasky on her retirement from her long and storied career as a teacher in the Medford Public Schools and thank Mrs. Lasky for her years of service and care for Medford students.

271
00:28:15,877 --> 00:28:16,438
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Tseng.

272
00:28:16,758 --> 00:28:17,799
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Bears.

273
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,463
[SPEAKER_18]: Mrs. Lasky was my fourth grade teacher.

274
00:28:22,464 --> 00:28:32,193
[SPEAKER_18]: She is such a legendary teacher that even before I made it to fourth grade, she was the cool teacher that everyone wanted to be in her class.

275
00:28:33,554 --> 00:28:36,637
[SPEAKER_18]: She did so many creative activities with students.

276
00:28:38,019 --> 00:28:38,499
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember

277
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:45,065
[SPEAKER_18]: she used to run classroom elections, and everyone got really excited and involved.

278
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:49,590
[SPEAKER_18]: And even if you didn't get a spot, I think you felt a buy-in into the classroom.

279
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:54,694
[SPEAKER_18]: You felt like you were part of a group of people working together and building a community.

280
00:28:55,435 --> 00:28:57,217
[SPEAKER_18]: That's something that she did so, so well.

281
00:28:57,537 --> 00:28:58,618
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I remember

282
00:28:59,699 --> 00:29:00,899
[SPEAKER_18]: It's so funny.

283
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:20,203
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember after a parent-teacher meeting that I wasn't at, she gave my parents really outside-of-the-box tips for how to get me out of my shell and how to get me more comfortable just making friends and speaking out for myself.

284
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:24,944
[SPEAKER_18]: And those tips, I think, have carried through with me through the years.

285
00:29:25,064 --> 00:29:26,124
[SPEAKER_18]: And I hope I've done you well.

286
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:46,670
[SPEAKER_18]: Another, I think, amazing moment was when Mrs. Lasky brought in her husband, Fred, to teach us about the MWRA and to teach us so much about how the water system works here in Medford and why water conservation is important.

287
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:53,633
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's small memories like that that I think really lead to the happiness of a childhood.

288
00:29:54,434 --> 00:29:56,295
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all those nostalgic memories that we look

289
00:29:56,975 --> 00:30:01,539
[SPEAKER_18]: At least I'm looking back on a lot recently with all these retirements.

290
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,802
[SPEAKER_18]: Mrs. Lasky, thank you for your service.

291
00:30:04,962 --> 00:30:11,148
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for your 25 years of service to the Medford Public Schools and for helping them since 2001.

292
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:17,454
[SPEAKER_18]: You mean so, so much, not just to me, but to so many members of our community.

293
00:30:18,054 --> 00:30:19,816
[SPEAKER_18]: I really want to both celebrate

294
00:30:20,836 --> 00:30:26,638
[SPEAKER_18]: this moment, and to say that I will be sad that when I go back to the McGlynn, I won't see you there.

295
00:30:27,098 --> 00:30:36,821
[SPEAKER_18]: But I know I will see you around Medford, and I look forward to seeing you around a lot more often now.

296
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:37,942
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

297
00:30:39,742 --> 00:30:44,544
[SPEAKER_16]: To the Babe Ruth and Willie Mays of the teaching profession.

298
00:30:46,772 --> 00:30:55,014
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanna thank Mrs. Lasky because I had the honor not only to be a parent of a child in her class, but also a colleague.

299
00:30:55,474 --> 00:30:59,335
[SPEAKER_16]: And you were the pinnacle.

300
00:30:59,475 --> 00:31:02,995
[SPEAKER_16]: You were what everybody wanted to aspire to as colleagues.

301
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:11,577
[SPEAKER_16]: And you never, you never wavered in your emotions.

302
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:13,958
[SPEAKER_16]: You were just a great teacher

303
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:17,183
[SPEAKER_16]: You were there for every single child.

304
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:20,125
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know the impact you made in my child's life.

305
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:29,753
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, dad's an elected official, but my son could care less about politics until he ran for fourth grade president.

306
00:31:30,786 --> 00:31:35,307
[SPEAKER_16]: And he woke up one morning with a suit on and he says, dad, can you hold this behind me?

307
00:31:35,367 --> 00:31:35,827
[SPEAKER_16]: I said, what is it?

308
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:37,468
[SPEAKER_16]: He said, it's American flag.

309
00:31:37,628 --> 00:31:38,568
[SPEAKER_16]: And I said, what are you going to do?

310
00:31:38,588 --> 00:31:41,988
[SPEAKER_16]: He says, I'm going to give my speech with someone holding the American flag behind me.

311
00:31:42,729 --> 00:31:46,009
[SPEAKER_16]: And I said, how come you didn't carry it with what dad's doing?

312
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:48,150
[SPEAKER_16]: He says, you weren't in Miss Lasky's class.

313
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:57,352
[SPEAKER_16]: And to Justin's point, I remember when he came home one day, he met Mr. Lasky and he says, I know what I want to do for my future, dad.

314
00:31:58,132 --> 00:31:59,133
[SPEAKER_16]: I said, why, what do you want to do?

315
00:31:59,153 --> 00:32:05,960
[SPEAKER_16]: He says, I met Mr. Lasky, and I want to be the reason why we clean Mystic the lake so we can all swim.

316
00:32:07,021 --> 00:32:18,713
[SPEAKER_16]: And just those impacts that we made, the growth and respect to our environment, the little lessons that became huge lessons today.

317
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:24,246
[SPEAKER_16]: I thank you from the bottom of my heart because it takes a village to raise your children.

318
00:32:24,686 --> 00:32:32,551
[SPEAKER_16]: And we were very fortunate, the Scarpelli household, to have you as one of our children's teachers and teaching them from right and wrong.

319
00:32:32,591 --> 00:32:34,132
[SPEAKER_16]: So we thank you so much.

320
00:32:34,312 --> 00:32:35,613
[SPEAKER_16]: You earned the retirement.

321
00:32:36,393 --> 00:32:38,094
[SPEAKER_16]: I know there's a huge void at the McGlynn.

322
00:32:38,354 --> 00:32:40,796
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember when we started, that was the A-Team, remember?

323
00:32:41,356 --> 00:32:42,537
[SPEAKER_16]: And to be in the same breath

324
00:32:43,217 --> 00:32:53,469
[SPEAKER_16]: as you know, I think was by default with my position, but to be in the same breath as when they called the 18 and talk and stand side by side with Don Alaska gave me a sense of pride.

325
00:32:53,529 --> 00:32:54,930
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you so much.

326
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:58,334
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for all your work and enjoy the retirement.

327
00:32:58,414 --> 00:32:58,975
[SPEAKER_16]: So thanks.

328
00:33:00,316 --> 00:33:01,457
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

329
00:33:03,017 --> 00:33:11,741
[SPEAKER_21]: I was neither a student or a parent or a colleague of Donna Lasky, but I was a student at Medford High with a Lasky child.

330
00:33:12,062 --> 00:33:21,566
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just know the impact that that family has had at multiple generations on this community and the service they provided to the city and to our young people.

331
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:27,289
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm incredibly grateful for Donna and for all of you for being in Medford and giving so much to our community.

332
00:33:28,993 --> 00:33:29,893
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further comments?

333
00:33:31,194 --> 00:33:32,794
[SPEAKER_21]: Would anyone from the public like to speak?

334
00:33:35,074 --> 00:33:37,655
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like, if we can, Mr. President, is bring Ms.

335
00:33:37,735 --> 00:33:43,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Lasky back, and we send her off with one of those wonderful citations that you draw up.

336
00:33:44,537 --> 00:33:44,717
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

337
00:33:44,737 --> 00:33:45,777
[SPEAKER_16]: That'd be great if we can.

338
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:46,337
[SPEAKER_16]: You got it.

339
00:33:46,377 --> 00:33:50,118
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe invite the whole Lasky family, because I know we haven't seen them for a while.

340
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:51,638
[SPEAKER_16]: But thank you.

341
00:33:52,219 --> 00:33:52,499
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

342
00:33:52,579 --> 00:33:53,839
[SPEAKER_21]: Two meetings for you guys, I guess.

343
00:33:53,859 --> 00:33:55,599
[SPEAKER_40]: Congratulations.

344
00:34:02,734 --> 00:34:04,255
[SPEAKER_22]: on the motion, oh, Director Hart.

345
00:34:04,656 --> 00:34:08,339
[SPEAKER_06]: May I just, but also, did I see the Chief here?

346
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, did I see the Chief here?

347
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,421
[SPEAKER_06]: She is right there.

348
00:34:10,461 --> 00:34:29,937
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't talk to them and you at the same time, but Mrs. Lasky has actually been one of the first teachers to be very supportive of the Environment Office in Medford and the Harvester Energy Festival that we hold every year behind the McGlynn School, and Mrs. Lasky's participated in that with our students as well.

349
00:34:30,572 --> 00:34:37,637
[SPEAKER_06]: And her husband was also chair of the Energy and Environment Committee when it was reformed as the Energy Committee in 2010.

350
00:34:38,038 --> 00:34:45,583
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I thought that it would be prudent for me as the Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability to thank her for her service as well.

351
00:34:45,663 --> 00:34:48,466
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was really sad to hear you were retiring.

352
00:34:48,766 --> 00:34:51,308
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have positions on boards and committees.

353
00:34:51,748 --> 00:34:53,269
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see me later about that.

354
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:54,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

355
00:34:55,981 --> 00:34:56,542
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

356
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:03,668
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Vice President Collins, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

357
00:35:04,429 --> 00:35:05,230
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Calderon?

358
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:05,890
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes.

359
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,373
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Collins?

360
00:35:08,513 --> 00:35:08,753
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

363
00:35:11,856 --> 00:35:12,517
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Osanic?

364
00:35:12,717 --> 00:35:12,957
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

365
00:35:13,537 --> 00:35:14,518
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Scopelli?

366
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:14,939
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

367
00:35:18,281 --> 00:35:22,986

370
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:32,134
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli.

371
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:33,034
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

372
00:35:33,915 --> 00:35:39,260
[SPEAKER_16]: We recently lost an amazing person from an amazing Medford family.

373
00:35:41,323 --> 00:35:43,164
[SPEAKER_16]: We had Lauren Kane passed away.

374
00:35:43,644 --> 00:36:00,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Those people that didn't know Lauren, Lauren was an unassuming but very powerful figure in our community for the fact when being a police officer, a female police officer, wasn't the norm.

375
00:36:01,252 --> 00:36:12,832
[SPEAKER_16]: she took that job with such pride and such vigor that she started as a young person, as a teacher, and then moved on to be a police officer, and then moved on to hold

376
00:36:13,775 --> 00:36:29,300
[SPEAKER_16]: to hold huge positions with the drug enforcement team and making sure that she played a huge impact in making sure that drugs weren't being distributed to our youth.

377
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,501
[SPEAKER_16]: And she worked for the DEA.

378
00:36:31,561 --> 00:36:32,821
[SPEAKER_16]: She worked for the city of Cambridge.

379
00:36:33,221 --> 00:36:35,242
[SPEAKER_16]: And most of all, she worked here for the city of Medford.

380
00:36:36,022 --> 00:36:45,205
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, it's a sad day for, uh, the method police department that they lost one of their own and, uh, she will definitely be missed.

381
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:53,768
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would ask that we send our condolences to the cane family for, um, for a person who really gave her life for our community.

382
00:36:54,348 --> 00:36:57,369
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, we may she rest in peace.

383
00:36:57,469 --> 00:36:58,009
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

384
00:36:59,369 --> 00:36:59,609
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

385
00:36:59,649 --> 00:37:01,290
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli, vice president Collins.

386
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:02,654
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, President Beres.

387
00:37:02,674 --> 00:37:05,255
[SPEAKER_29]: We want to thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, for putting this forward tonight.

388
00:37:06,755 --> 00:37:15,757
[SPEAKER_29]: Of course, it's always a sad occasion when somebody with such a huge impact, you know, yet another public servant, when we have to mark their passing here in Medford.

389
00:37:17,377 --> 00:37:29,000
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, and sad as it is, I'm glad for the opportunity to reflect on, you know, a person, a woman with a career that, who really ran right at challenge and the ability to do an outsized amount of good in our community.

390
00:37:30,046 --> 00:37:32,148
[SPEAKER_29]: So I spend my deepest condolences to her family.

391
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:34,790
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

392
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:38,273
[SPEAKER_21]: Would anyone from the public like to speak on this item?

[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, several affirmative, no, the negative, the motion passes and the records are approved.

428
00:39:02,814 --> 00:39:06,458
[SPEAKER_21]: Reports of committees, 24-033 offered by Vice President Collins.

429

[SPEAKER_21]: Planning and permitting committee, June 12th, 2024.

430

431
00:39:12,196 --> 00:39:13,537
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, President Bears.

432
00:39:14,337 --> 00:39:27,906
[SPEAKER_29]: On June 12th, the topic of the planning and permitting committee, which was the same one as which wrapped up right before this regular meeting, we were meeting with our zoning consultant, Innis Associates, which frequent flyers have heard me give this context before.

433
00:39:28,046 --> 00:39:31,629
[SPEAKER_29]: This is the zoning consultant that the city council hired at the end of last term.

434
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:37,913
[SPEAKER_29]: And in many meetings of the planning and permitting committee this term, we have been working with them to create a work plan

435
00:39:38,433 --> 00:39:52,901
[SPEAKER_29]: pulling from the comprehensive plan, the climate action adaptation plan, the housing production plan to consider proposed changes to the zoning ordinance to make manifest in our zoning the goals and topics that the community has placed into those plans.

436
00:39:54,301 --> 00:40:06,948
[SPEAKER_29]: The topic of the June 12th meeting was to review the status of the mapping analysis and the topic-based work plan that will inform our future committee's work and votes over the summer and into the fall.

437
00:40:08,595 --> 00:40:09,175
[SPEAKER_29]: motion to approve.

438
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:16,160
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion to approve by Vice President Collins, seconded by second, seconded by Councilor Ming.

439
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,401
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

440
00:40:25,986 --> 00:40:26,827
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Callahan?

441
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:27,507
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes.

442
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,049
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Collins?

443
00:40:30,129 --> 00:40:30,389
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes.

444
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,951
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Lozano?

445
00:40:33,011 --> 00:40:33,331
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

446
00:40:33,651 --> 00:40:34,452
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Laming?

447
00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:34,792
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

448
00:40:35,192 --> 00:40:36,193
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Scapelli?

449
00:40:36,253 --> 00:40:36,453
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

450
00:40:39,334 --> 00:41:02,366
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I mean affirmative none of the negative the motion passes refer to committee for further discussion to 4-4 to 2 offered by councillor Lazzaro Whereas the Massachusetts Department of Transportation is planning to make changes to a busy intersection in the heart of Medford Square Which will impact drivers cyclists and pedestrians for many years to come and whereas the Medford Bicycle Commission attended an informational meeting on

451
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:04,827
[SPEAKER_21]: and express concerns with the plan made thus far.

452
00:41:05,347 --> 00:41:19,511
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that a representative from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, familiar with the plan, shall meet with the Medford City Council, a representative of the Medford Bicycle Commission, and a representative of the City of Medford Traffic and Transportation Department in committee to discuss said plans.

453
00:41:19,992 --> 00:41:21,932
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilors, which committee would you like to refer us to?

454
00:41:22,352 --> 00:41:27,094
[SPEAKER_37]: I think the Department of Public Works committee makes the most sense.

455
00:41:27,774 --> 00:41:29,215
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Callahan is the chair.

456
00:41:30,726 --> 00:41:37,648
[SPEAKER_37]: I think because it's to do with traffic, changing the roadways and intersections there.

457
00:41:38,268 --> 00:41:48,371
[SPEAKER_37]: That intersection, it's the one right below the overpass of Route 16, the bridge over the river, right by deep cuts.

458
00:41:48,951 --> 00:41:50,392
[SPEAKER_37]: It's a very busy intersection.

459
00:41:50,412 --> 00:41:56,594
[SPEAKER_37]: The Massachusetts Department of Transportation is

460
00:41:57,921 --> 00:42:05,127
[SPEAKER_37]: in charge of it, but it is really integral to how the center of Medford operates.

461
00:42:05,507 --> 00:42:13,233
[SPEAKER_37]: And I think it's important that we make sure that the community is involved and we have a lot of stakeholders.

462
00:42:13,854 --> 00:42:27,445
[SPEAKER_37]: And I think it would be a great opportunity for that committee to have a fruitful discussion and make sure that we're sharing our opinions on how best to address improvements

463
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:29,874
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

464
00:42:29,974 --> 00:42:35,157
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of Councilors are to refer to the Public Works and Facilities Committee seconded by Vice President Collins.

465
00:42:35,758 --> 00:42:36,378

466
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:37,739
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Callahan.

467
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,761
[SPEAKER_19]: If everyone could shut off their microphones, please.

468
00:42:44,202 --> 00:42:45,203
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Callahan.

469
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:46,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

470
00:42:47,644 --> 00:42:48,944
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

471
00:42:49,765 --> 00:42:56,886
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that this intersection has been a sore spot for many years, and I look forward to a discussion in the Public Works Committee.

472
00:42:57,346 --> 00:42:59,707
[SPEAKER_01]: So I welcome that to come into the committee.

473
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

474
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:02,227

[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:15,690
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

480
00:43:20,416 --> 00:43:21,997
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I have an affirmative, none in the negative.

481
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:22,997
[SPEAKER_21]: The motion passes.

482
00:43:23,578 --> 00:43:24,598
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

483
00:43:25,299 --> 00:43:25,559
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

484
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:28,500
[SPEAKER_28]: I have a motion to suspend the rules to take the following papers out of order.

485
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,921
[SPEAKER_28]: 24-426, 24-418, 24-423, 24-424, and 24-436.

486
00:43:44,505 --> 00:43:48,227
[SPEAKER_20]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to take papers 2-4-426, 2-4-418, 2-4, you said 4-2-3?

487
00:43:48,247 --> 00:43:48,987
[SPEAKER_20]: Dash 4-2-3, 2-4-424, and 2-4-436.

488

489
00:43:51,569 --> 00:43:51,849
[SPEAKER_20]: Second.

490
00:43:52,629 --> 00:43:53,590
[SPEAKER_20]: By Councilor Leming.

491
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:56,612
[SPEAKER_20]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

492
00:43:56,652 --> 00:43:58,052
[SPEAKER_21]: To take these, yeah.

493
00:44:19,481 --> 00:44:19,641
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

494
00:44:19,661 --> 00:44:19,942
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

495
00:44:19,962 --> 00:44:20,162
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

496
00:44:20,722 --> 00:44:21,003
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes.

497
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:25,787
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

498
00:44:25,847 --> 00:44:26,007
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

499
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,381
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, 70 affirmative, none negative, the motion passes.

500
00:44:44,082 --> 00:45:08,712
[SPEAKER_21]: 24426, be it ordered that the city council enact a temporary moratorium on the issuance of licenses and permits for the purpose of operating a methadone clinic distribution facility in the city of Medford, and be it resolved, this moratorium remain in effect until a recommendation is received from the mayor's office proposing amendments to the zoning use chart to establish safe access to said facilities in the city of Medford, and be it further resolved, all meetings related to this topic be held in the hybrid fashion, accessible to both citizens, both in person and virtually.

501
00:45:09,392 --> 00:45:10,272
[SPEAKER_21]: We do have an update.

502
00:45:12,153 --> 00:45:19,115
[SPEAKER_21]: We received a letter from Habit Opco LLC today, June 25th, 2024.

503
00:45:20,095 --> 00:45:20,756
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll read it now.

504
00:45:20,836 --> 00:45:26,717
[SPEAKER_21]: Re Habit Opco LLC application for a special permit for Treatment Center 360 Salem Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

505
00:45:27,478 --> 00:45:31,739
[SPEAKER_21]: Dear city councilors, we're writing on behalf of Habit Opco in connection with tonight's city council meeting.

506
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,840
[SPEAKER_21]: As you know, on April 16th, Habit Opco applied for a special permit.

507
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,641
[SPEAKER_21]: for a comprehensive treatment center, quote, CTC proposed for 360 Salem Street.

508
00:45:40,161 --> 00:45:44,702
[SPEAKER_21]: Yesterday, we learned of a proposed resolution, 24-426, placed on the meeting agenda.

509
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:51,483
[SPEAKER_21]: The resolution urges the city council to impose a citywide moratorium on opioid treatment programs.

510
00:45:51,963 --> 00:45:56,764
[SPEAKER_21]: We thought you should know that Habit Opco is withdrawing its special permit application for 360 Salem Street.

511
00:45:57,265 --> 00:45:59,465
[SPEAKER_21]: It intends to search for a different location within Medford,

512
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:04,921
[SPEAKER_21]: We made this decision carefully after meeting with officials, reviewing public comments, and weighing relevant considerations.

513
00:46:05,481 --> 00:46:11,962
[SPEAKER_21]: As you know, after filing its application, HABIT OPCO reached out to city staff and officials, including city councilors, to discuss any concerns.

514
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:18,224
[SPEAKER_21]: It is an open-door policy to discussing issues and considering feedback, and we intended to approach the special permit hearing with the same openness.

515
00:46:18,744 --> 00:46:24,745
[SPEAKER_21]: We still feel we could address neighborhood concerns, but we recognize that there are times when a certain amount of adversity can undermine a cause.

516
00:46:25,385 --> 00:46:29,746
[SPEAKER_21]: We take as genuine the comments of many Medford residents that they are not averse to the use

517
00:46:30,346 --> 00:46:33,148
[SPEAKER_21]: or blind to the need, but have concerns with the proposed location.

518
00:46:33,688 --> 00:46:38,512
[SPEAKER_21]: Habit Opco is committed to ensuring that victims of the opioid crises have access to life-saving medical care.

519
00:46:39,072 --> 00:46:43,875
[SPEAKER_21]: Medication-assisted treatment is the best tool we have to combat that crisis that has claimed thousands of lives in Commonwealth.

520
00:46:44,275 --> 00:46:49,379
[SPEAKER_21]: There's an urgent need for treatment facilities, yet locations are not easy to find.

521
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:56,564
[SPEAKER_21]: We look forward to working with the city to find an appropriate location for a CTC, and we thank all of those who have provided helpful insights over the last two months.

522
00:46:57,503 --> 00:46:59,545
[SPEAKER_21]: Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

523
00:46:59,905 --> 00:47:02,388
[SPEAKER_21]: Douglas Troyer, attorney for Habit OpCo LLC.

524
00:47:03,169 --> 00:47:06,552
[SPEAKER_21]: We also have Planning Director Hunt and legal representation here.

525
00:47:06,692 --> 00:47:08,695
[SPEAKER_21]: And with that, I will turn over to Councilor Scarpelli.

526
00:47:09,115 --> 00:47:12,078
[SPEAKER_21]: I will just remind everyone again, the application has been withdrawn.

527
00:47:12,098 --> 00:47:15,782
[SPEAKER_21]: The council is not the special permit granting authority for this type of use.

528
00:47:16,082 --> 00:47:16,823
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli.

529
00:47:17,283 --> 00:47:18,184
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

530
00:47:18,484 --> 00:47:25,329
[SPEAKER_16]: So first I want to commend the neighbors and the residents that really pulled together.

531
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:34,495
[SPEAKER_16]: And what you see in front of you is what happens when you see that something might affect our neighborhood in a negative way.

532
00:47:35,276 --> 00:47:44,322
[SPEAKER_16]: What I found amazing is I went to an organization, a group of neighbors put together a meeting at the Fireman's Club, and I think probably about 130 people showed up.

533
00:47:46,007 --> 00:47:58,472
[SPEAKER_16]: And what we heard from everybody there with respect and honor to every individual involved was that nobody was against the process of helping people.

534
00:47:59,693 --> 00:48:11,798
[SPEAKER_16]: But what everybody was looking for is making sure that this facility or a facility like this would be put in a location where it didn't affect residential neighborhoods.

535
00:48:14,986 --> 00:48:25,878
[SPEAKER_16]: It's amazing to see the community rally around this and really start a grassroots quick organization to really rally around and just educate people.

536
00:48:26,438 --> 00:48:27,700
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's what's important.

537
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:35,107
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that we have, what I realized in those conversations, there were some people very angry at George Scapelli.

538
00:48:35,988 --> 00:48:37,749
[SPEAKER_16]: and deservedly so.

539
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:57,334
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this is something that we talked about with our leadership team here that when we did the recodification of our zoning and we implemented these type of facilities in the medical field, in the zoning process, that it was then going to go to a special permit.

540
00:48:57,714 --> 00:49:01,795
[SPEAKER_16]: We realized the impact it could have now legally

541
00:49:02,904 --> 00:49:06,525
[SPEAKER_16]: with the facility like a methadone, and people keep saying clinic.

542
00:49:07,025 --> 00:49:10,827
[SPEAKER_16]: And what really brought a lot of people to their feet was it's not a clinic.

543
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:17,269
[SPEAKER_16]: There weren't people there to assist people that were addicted, but it was just a distribution site.

544
00:49:18,249 --> 00:49:18,369
[SPEAKER_16]: And

545
00:49:19,798 --> 00:49:34,265
[SPEAKER_16]: We had people that were involved that were both former recovering addicts, and we talked to administrators in the field, and they really shared an input that really educated a lot of people.

546
00:49:34,425 --> 00:49:39,947
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, at the end of the discussion, it wasn't that, let's keep these people out of Medford.

547
00:49:40,007 --> 00:49:45,150
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it was, if it's needed in Medford, let's find a location where

548
00:49:46,164 --> 00:49:52,126
[SPEAKER_16]: they can get their help and the support, but at the same time not affect a residential area that's.

549
00:49:52,970 --> 00:50:01,536
[SPEAKER_16]: Feeds away from a dance studio, a school, the lack of parking in that area affecting small businesses.

550
00:50:01,596 --> 00:50:11,203
[SPEAKER_16]: So there were a lot of little intricacies that played a huge part in what that neighborhood, the effects it would have had in the Salem Street neighborhood.

551
00:50:12,024 --> 00:50:12,804
[SPEAKER_16]: I commend the mayor.

552
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:19,949
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that I had some issues because we wanted to make sure that without a city solicitor, I reached out to the mayor this weekend.

553
00:50:23,194 --> 00:50:32,287
[SPEAKER_16]: She had an attorney that's well-versed in these topics to call me to make sure that we didn't say something that would get us in trouble later.

554
00:50:33,028 --> 00:50:35,892
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that with this motion,

555
00:50:37,918 --> 00:50:42,160
[SPEAKER_16]: And as this process started moving forward, you saw that everybody was listening.

556
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:44,962
[SPEAKER_16]: You saw that every department in the city was listening.

557
00:50:45,362 --> 00:50:47,043
[SPEAKER_16]: The mayor was listening, right?

558
00:50:47,783 --> 00:50:53,046
[SPEAKER_16]: The Board of Appeals said, one of the biggest questions was, well, how do we make this a hybrid meeting?

559
00:50:53,106 --> 00:50:56,108
[SPEAKER_16]: Because there are people that couldn't make a Zoom meeting.

560
00:50:56,648 --> 00:51:04,372
[SPEAKER_16]: So making it, opening it up to everybody in the community so everybody had an input in this decision.

561
00:51:06,986 --> 00:51:23,144
[SPEAKER_16]: My motion tonight would still be for a moratorium moving forward, but working directly with Mrs. Hunt and the mayor's office and making sure that we look at our zoning to make sure that any

562
00:51:24,225 --> 00:51:33,431
[SPEAKER_16]: Any facilities under this criteria are moved into non-residential areas where it won't affect our residents.

563
00:51:33,552 --> 00:51:41,717
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, there's still a process, but that would be my recommendation and my resolution if we can, Mr. President.

564
00:51:41,797 --> 00:51:48,121
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that the meetings are hybrid, so everybody can still attend those meetings.

565
00:51:48,182 --> 00:51:49,182
[SPEAKER_16]: That was very important.

566
00:51:49,823 --> 00:51:52,364
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, I can't thank

567
00:51:54,994 --> 00:52:07,163
[SPEAKER_16]: This sometimes is elected official, you look back and you say, geez, with this process, sometimes being a politician, you get, you know, your colleagues have one way of thinking, you have another way of thinking, and kind of get a little discouraged.

568
00:52:07,683 --> 00:52:13,827
[SPEAKER_16]: But one thing you do know is that you all love the city of Medford, and we're all fighting for the right reasons.

569
00:52:14,128 --> 00:52:15,569
[SPEAKER_16]: And what I saw

570
00:52:16,857 --> 00:52:22,842
[SPEAKER_16]: this past week with community members rallying together to make sure everybody was heard.

571
00:52:23,503 --> 00:52:35,974
[SPEAKER_16]: What I loved, there was, you know, I'm getting phone calls from young people that have young children in the schools that just moved to Method a few years ago, but in the same breath, they were

572
00:52:36,394 --> 00:52:41,463
[SPEAKER_16]: introducing me to their 88-year-old neighbor that they were making sure that they felt comfortable.

573
00:52:41,884 --> 00:52:42,865
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what's amazing.

574
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:45,930
[SPEAKER_16]: We really took care of our neighbors with this situation.

575
00:52:46,271 --> 00:52:49,957
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, I'm going to say this again because we talked about this issue too.

576
00:52:51,411 --> 00:52:52,832
[SPEAKER_16]: This wasn't to divide at all.

577
00:52:52,852 --> 00:52:56,996
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that people are looking at social media and saying, this part of the city is saying, suck it up.

578
00:52:57,356 --> 00:52:58,757
[SPEAKER_16]: This part of the city is saying this.

579
00:52:59,137 --> 00:53:05,022
[SPEAKER_16]: These people are saying that, you know, shame on you for not wanting to take care of people that need support.

580
00:53:05,642 --> 00:53:06,763
[SPEAKER_16]: That was never the case.

581
00:53:07,464 --> 00:53:12,308
[SPEAKER_16]: With everybody I talked to, it was an open mind, but with the goal of making sure that

582
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:21,472
[SPEAKER_16]: These types of facilities are located in the community that doesn't affect our residential neighborhood.

583
00:53:21,512 --> 00:53:28,975
[SPEAKER_16]: So I give them all the respect and pats on the back that they deserve.

584
00:53:29,636 --> 00:53:39,680
[SPEAKER_16]: And I appreciate this company that realized that maybe this isn't the way to go and didn't want to continue with the fight.

585
00:53:43,852 --> 00:53:50,755
[SPEAKER_16]: For now, Salem Street is in a better place right now because there were a lot of issues.

586
00:53:50,855 --> 00:53:57,257
[SPEAKER_16]: And it wasn't just what people would think that with the methadone distribution site coming.

587
00:53:57,557 --> 00:53:59,038
[SPEAKER_16]: People were concerned about the parking.

588
00:53:59,058 --> 00:54:03,259
[SPEAKER_16]: People were concerned about the small businesses.

589
00:54:03,319 --> 00:54:05,660
[SPEAKER_16]: And people were concerned about that whole corridor.

590
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:10,142
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that it was really expressed in a mature, responsible,

591
00:54:13,304 --> 00:54:18,227
[SPEAKER_16]: diplomatic and not divisional conversation.

592
00:54:18,267 --> 00:54:19,228
[SPEAKER_16]: So I appreciate that.

593
00:54:19,828 --> 00:54:39,002
[SPEAKER_16]: And I will tell you, I am so impressed with, and as I move forward, I'll put a motion through Mr. President later on, that we convene a community engagement committee that brings in the talent we have in our community,

594
00:54:39,755 --> 00:54:46,516
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, there are some amazing people that are in the field of addiction.

595
00:54:46,556 --> 00:55:02,500
[SPEAKER_16]: There are amazing people that are engineers, and there's amazing people that work with traffic studies, and there are doctors, and there are legal minds that really came out and shared their expertise for the greater good.

596
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,221
[SPEAKER_16]: Not to be negative, not to go one way or the other, but really to share an opinion.

597
00:55:08,101 --> 00:55:16,263
[SPEAKER_16]: I commend everybody here for being here and following through with something that they knew that was going to impact their neighborhood and this community.

598
00:55:16,323 --> 00:55:36,487
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm glad to see that a wrong is righted and we'll be working hopefully after we pass this resolution that we work with the mayor's office and the community development team and really try to change that zoning so we're not in this position again that we're making sure that if it's needed then

599
00:55:37,307 --> 00:55:41,194
[SPEAKER_16]: we'll have a location where it's not gonna impact the community like it has in last week.

600
00:55:41,214 --> 00:55:42,176
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you, Mr. President.

601
00:55:43,218 --> 00:55:43,559
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

602
00:56:18,797 --> 00:56:19,257
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

603
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:20,438
[SPEAKER_21]: And thank you, Councilor Scarpa.

604
00:56:20,458 --> 00:56:38,413
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we have noted here that all of the parties involved, whether it's the city council and city councilors or planning office or residents and community members who are engaged and even the petitioner, as they noted in their letter, they did want to hear the feedback of the community.

605
00:56:38,453 --> 00:56:39,795
[SPEAKER_21]: They did want to engage in good faith.

606
00:56:39,835 --> 00:56:41,056
[SPEAKER_21]: They did want to do this the right way.

607
00:56:41,596 --> 00:56:42,876
[SPEAKER_21]: So that is where we are.

608
00:56:44,057 --> 00:56:53,099
[SPEAKER_21]: We have an intent and an approach, I think, to work together to find a site, if they want to continue looking in Medford, that meets community needs.

609
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:59,120
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that is what we ask of everyone who petitions for a special permit of any kind.

610
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:02,301
[SPEAKER_21]: I also want to note that the zoning we have now does need to be updated.

611
00:57:02,361 --> 00:57:03,601
[SPEAKER_21]: We're working through that process.

612
00:57:04,321 --> 00:57:07,963
[SPEAKER_21]: This was a special permit process, so there still would have been a process to require.

613
00:57:07,983 --> 00:57:12,606
[SPEAKER_21]: They couldn't just come in and do it in a residential area, which I think is an important point to note.

614
00:57:13,427 --> 00:57:16,729
[SPEAKER_21]: We do have the planning director and council present.

615
00:57:16,869 --> 00:57:18,991
[SPEAKER_21]: I do want to invite Director Hunt up.

616
00:57:19,651 --> 00:57:25,015
[SPEAKER_21]: to speak, and then I'm hoping we can refer this to the committee to come up with something.

617
00:57:25,035 --> 00:57:30,859
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that we got some legal advice around the specific structure of something like this, how it would need to be structured.

618
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:38,824
[SPEAKER_21]: People with substance use disorders are a protected class, so we have to be very careful in the legal construction of anything around this.

619
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:46,147
[SPEAKER_21]: Right now, if we were to institute something with the current zoning, we would ban any medical office from opening in the city of Medford whatsoever.

620
00:57:46,988 --> 00:57:51,289
[SPEAKER_21]: So we really need to go through the diligent process to get this right and follow the law.

621
00:57:51,329 --> 00:57:52,189
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's what we will do.

622
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:56,011
[SPEAKER_21]: And with that, I will go to the Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability, Alicia Hunt.

623
00:58:01,252 --> 00:58:08,435
[SPEAKER_06]: President Bares, I think that you, Alicia Hunt, Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability, I think you actually said everything

624
00:58:09,011 --> 00:58:12,453
[SPEAKER_06]: that I was, uh, had prepared to share with the council.

625
00:58:13,154 --> 00:58:22,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, there are a couple of just the points that I just want to make sure that everybody's aware of is that addiction is defined as a substance use disorder and is recognized as a disease.

626
00:58:23,321 --> 00:58:26,623
[SPEAKER_06]: And therefore we need to be careful about any civil rights violations.

627
00:58:27,043 --> 00:58:33,468
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have to be very careful about how everything is framed, what people say, how it's, um, how it's handled.

628
00:58:33,528 --> 00:58:35,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I provided information to the council,

629
00:58:36,338 --> 00:58:40,401
[SPEAKER_06]: or to Councilor Bears, from the U.S.

630
00:58:40,441 --> 00:58:52,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Commission on Civil Rights or Statements on Substance Abuse and the ADA, which is a very difficult situation because having a disease is a protected class.

631
00:58:54,671 --> 00:59:04,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I did want to make sure that everybody from the public knows that all of the letters that were received by myself, by the planning office, and by the Zoning Board of Appeals

632
00:59:04,968 --> 00:59:07,009
[SPEAKER_06]: were provided to the applicant.

633
00:59:07,409 --> 00:59:12,750
[SPEAKER_06]: So they do have, I thought about counting the numbers of letters, but there are a lot of them.

634
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:21,692
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of those statements, all of that information has gone to them so that I didn't want anybody to think that there wasn't an opportunity to express that.

635
00:59:23,312 --> 00:59:31,854
[SPEAKER_06]: When we talk about moratoriums, the legal advice is that they have to be time limited and tied to a significant impact.

636
00:59:32,301 --> 00:59:33,922
[SPEAKER_06]: and have a plan for resolution.

637
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:40,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Also this situation, this is a zoning special permit.

638
00:59:40,524 --> 00:59:46,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore the city council doesn't actually have the ability to just pass a moratorium in one meeting.

639
00:59:46,647 --> 00:59:59,232
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, you could not vote tonight to pass a moratorium on medical office uses in Medford or substance abuse clinics and that take effect because it's a zoning issue.

640
00:59:59,824 --> 01:00:11,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, the proper language, as you started to say, has to be put in front of the City Council, which then has to refer it to the Community Development Board, who has to hold a public hearing.

641
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:16,638
[SPEAKER_06]: And the public hearing must be properly noticed for two weeks, and then they refer back their

642
01:00:18,041 --> 01:00:21,822
[SPEAKER_06]: recommendation to the City Council, which must also hold a public hearing.

643
01:00:22,263 --> 01:00:28,545
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted people to be aware that there is not actually a legal option here to just pass something tonight.

644
01:00:29,005 --> 01:00:30,866
[SPEAKER_06]: It would literally have to go through.

645
01:00:30,906 --> 01:00:39,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you could pass a resolution that the City Council cannot issue a permit, but this permit is not in front of the City Council.

646
01:00:40,589 --> 01:00:46,712
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to be clear about the process and that it does take some time to be done correctly.

647
01:00:48,906 --> 01:00:59,271
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other item that I wanted to mention is that the CD board and the zoning board both received the notice to withdraw.

648
01:00:59,791 --> 01:01:07,974
[SPEAKER_06]: So they intend to basically receive that and accept that withdrawal and not take public comment.

649
01:01:08,275 --> 01:01:12,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say that the zoning board will be hybrid still because that is how it was advertised.

650
01:01:13,137 --> 01:01:15,978
[SPEAKER_06]: So the intention is that the zoning board on Thursday night

651
01:01:16,905 --> 01:01:26,969
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the staff and at least the chair, I don't know how many of the members will be here in the council chambers, and the option would be to come here in person or remote.

652
01:01:26,989 --> 01:01:30,290
[SPEAKER_06]: There are actually a large number of items on the agenda for Thursday night.

653
01:01:31,331 --> 01:01:41,294
[SPEAKER_06]: The CD board, in order for us to hold a proper hybrid meeting, we really actually, especially anything that's gonna have a large number of attendees, needs to use the city council chamber.

654
01:01:41,895 --> 01:01:45,756
[SPEAKER_06]: So the city council chamber is not available Wednesday night for the community development board,

655
01:01:46,138 --> 01:01:47,779
[SPEAKER_06]: because the City Council is using it.

656
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:59,968
[SPEAKER_06]: So that meeting had intended to hold a room that would be available here in City Hall with staff for anybody who doesn't have access to Zoom.

657
01:02:00,498 --> 01:02:16,905
[SPEAKER_06]: to help them provide public comment, display the meeting on the large monitor, and have them be able to speak through that through staff, to speak on the meeting, but the staff would work the Zoom in the other, sorry, the other conference room.

658
01:02:16,925 --> 01:02:19,046
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted that to be clear.

659
01:02:19,666 --> 01:02:26,188
[SPEAKER_06]: They can still provide that option, but the only items on the CD board meeting then without this is a,

660
01:02:28,337 --> 01:02:32,160
[SPEAKER_06]: very technical item called an approval not required and approval of minutes.

661
01:02:33,001 --> 01:02:37,025
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't want people to waste their times because I know people have very busy lives.

662
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,867
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to put that information forward.

663
01:02:40,348 --> 01:02:41,629
[SPEAKER_06]: If there are any questions about

664
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:45,750
[SPEAKER_06]: the procedural matters, I am more than happy to answer procedural questions.

665
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:49,753
[SPEAKER_21]: I just wanted to confirm what you just said for simplicity's sake.

666
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:51,714
[SPEAKER_21]: The application has been withdrawn.

667
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:55,856
[SPEAKER_21]: There's currently no application to consider this from this company anywhere in the city.

668
01:02:55,876 --> 01:03:01,620
[SPEAKER_21]: It will be withdrawn at tomorrow night's City Community Development Board meeting, Thursday's Zoning Board of Appeals meeting.

669
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:11,546
[SPEAKER_21]: And as discussed in the letter and as discussed by Councilor Scarpelli, the intent of all parties is to have more discussions about as a city developing

670
01:03:12,146 --> 01:03:22,532
[SPEAKER_21]: and looking at this in the zoning context and from the applicant working in good faith with the city and community members to find a site if they want to continue in Medford, that is not in a residential area.

671
01:03:22,852 --> 01:03:23,472
[SPEAKER_33]: That is correct.

672
01:03:23,712 --> 01:03:24,092
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

673
01:03:24,613 --> 01:03:25,533
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

674
01:03:26,614 --> 01:03:27,494
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, President Bears.

675
01:03:27,914 --> 01:03:29,475
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you for putting this forward, Councilor Scarpelli.

676
01:03:29,595 --> 01:03:31,236
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you so much for the context, Director Hunt.

677
01:03:31,956 --> 01:03:35,658
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you to so many people for joining us in the council chambers, as always.

678
01:03:38,473 --> 01:03:55,020
[SPEAKER_29]: I wouldn't wanna put words in Councilor Scarpelli's mouth, but when we're on the topic about how to proceed here procedurally, in the committee meeting directly before this one, in the planning and permitting committee, we were actually just discussing the issue of Salem Street Corridor as one of our zoning priorities as we move forward.

679
01:03:56,081 --> 01:04:03,384
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think that this could be just a really cohesive move to refer this paper, which as we've been discussing needs a little bit more

680
01:04:04,687 --> 01:04:05,508
[SPEAKER_29]: that it needs tweaking.

681
01:04:05,548 --> 01:04:07,549
[SPEAKER_29]: This is a zoning issue.

682
01:04:07,769 --> 01:04:09,890
[SPEAKER_29]: We've never done a zoning issue in one meeting.

683
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:22,138
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that that aligns very closely with the work that we were just discussing doing in the zoning committee, knowing that the rezoning of re-evaluating the zoning of Salem Street is already a priority for the council.

684
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:24,060
[SPEAKER_29]: We were just speaking about that in the last committee meeting.

685
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:37,104
[SPEAKER_29]: And so I think it could be, I think it could dovetail really nicely with our existing plans to take a look at Salem Street Corridor in addition to some other priority corridors in the city and say, what does our zoning allow us to do here by right?

686
01:04:37,964 --> 01:04:50,908
[SPEAKER_29]: What does it allow us to do by a special permit, which until this permit was withdrawn, applied to this permit, what do we wanna see on these corridors and how should we update our zoning so that we get what we want and we don't have to worry about what we don't want

687
01:04:51,488 --> 01:04:51,708
[SPEAKER_29]: here.

688
01:04:51,728 --> 01:05:03,290
[SPEAKER_29]: And I do want to note, I've been hearing this, you know, over and over for the past couple weeks, and I'm really heartened to hear it from so many people in the community saying, it's not that I think we shouldn't have this in Medford.

689
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:05,550
[SPEAKER_29]: It's just that the location has to be right.

690
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:12,092
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think that something I'm really certain we all share is that, you know, we know that this is something that people need.

691
01:05:12,112 --> 01:05:15,392
[SPEAKER_29]: This is a service that people need, that people in Medford need, that our neighbors need.

692
01:05:16,172 --> 01:05:17,312
[SPEAKER_29]: We want it to be successful.

693
01:05:17,533 --> 01:05:20,013
[SPEAKER_29]: And in order to be successful, it needs to be in the right location.

694
01:05:20,553 --> 01:05:43,098
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think that we can, I would love to prioritize this issue within our existing zoning work to make sure that as we're reevaluating our zoning already in progress, we're taking a look to say, where's the right spot for this use and how can we make sure that it can occur here and not in locations where it's going to be less successful and less supported by residents for understandable reasons.

695
01:05:43,758 --> 01:05:43,958
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

696
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:45,880
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

697
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:46,981
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there a motion on the floor?

698
01:05:47,001 --> 01:05:50,023
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll go to Councilor Lazzaro, but was there a motion to refer?

699
01:05:50,043 --> 01:05:51,565
[SPEAKER_21]: I couldn't quite tell.

700
01:05:51,645 --> 01:05:57,129
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to clear clarity with the Council, if I can, Council President.

701
01:05:57,729 --> 01:06:05,115
[SPEAKER_16]: I know we have the Council, we have a representative that the city had hired to work directly.

702
01:06:05,575 --> 01:06:06,616
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to make sure that

703
01:06:07,717 --> 01:06:13,260
[SPEAKER_16]: I, what I put in as a motion is legally, um, you know, acceptable.

704
01:06:13,461 --> 01:06:17,383
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to put something in that's going to negatively affect that.

705
01:06:17,503 --> 01:06:20,505
[SPEAKER_21]: I did invite the director and council up for specific questions to them.

706
01:06:20,585 --> 01:06:23,226
[SPEAKER_21]: So I will, we'll do that and then we'll go around and then we'll be done.

707
01:06:23,427 --> 01:06:23,667
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

708
01:06:24,434 --> 01:06:27,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor, Mr. President, my name is Tom Mullen.

709
01:06:27,816 --> 01:06:41,685
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been retained as special counsel pending the determination of whether KP law, your city solicitor, uh, has, has a conflict or can continue, uh, with this matter.

710
01:06:42,406 --> 01:06:42,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

711
01:06:43,815 --> 01:06:55,861
[SPEAKER_10]: As we heard Councilor Scarpelli say, the focus here is going to be making sure that a dispensary of this type, if it goes into Medford, goes into the right place.

712
01:06:56,841 --> 01:07:03,084
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is going to be the focus of any amendments to the zoning ordinance.

713
01:07:03,704 --> 01:07:07,066
[SPEAKER_10]: I would ask that you not, um, uh,

714
01:07:08,015 --> 01:07:12,263
[SPEAKER_10]: attempt to deal with this with the blunt instrument of a moratorium.

715
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:20,158
[SPEAKER_10]: I say that because there have been a number of cases in Massachusetts and in our First Circuit

716
01:07:21,092 --> 01:07:28,054
[SPEAKER_10]: where cities and towns attempted to use a moratorium and they were struck down.

717
01:07:29,034 --> 01:07:39,737
[SPEAKER_10]: And losing a case like that means you lose a civil rights action, there are damages, you pay the other side's attorney's fees in addition to losing the issue.

718
01:07:40,916 --> 01:08:07,015
[SPEAKER_10]: The right way to go about this, I think, is the way that the council has been tending this evening, which is to work on amending the zoning ordinance to make sure that dispensaries like this, which everybody agrees have a place, are in the right place, and to deal with the effects, the externalities, such as traffic and parking, that bother all of us.

719
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:10,480
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope that answers your question.

720
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,581
[SPEAKER_37]: Point of information, President?

721
01:08:11,681 --> 01:08:13,703
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a question for Council.

722
01:08:14,483 --> 01:08:15,624
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Zahra.

723
01:08:15,804 --> 01:08:18,946
[SPEAKER_37]: Can we please use the words medical office instead of dispensary?

724
01:08:29,214 --> 01:08:31,435
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not going to do this tonight, y'all, so...

725
01:08:35,919 --> 01:08:39,341
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, would you, we can stop right now if we want.

726
01:08:40,442 --> 01:08:41,863
[SPEAKER_21]: Please don't disrupt the public meeting.

727
01:08:43,464 --> 01:08:45,125
[SPEAKER_21]: Please don't disrupt the public meeting.

728
01:08:45,506 --> 01:08:47,027
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a good resolution here.

729
01:08:47,587 --> 01:08:49,849
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you want, we can shut this down right now.

730
01:08:49,869 --> 01:08:57,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, if we could just move forward and send this to the subcommittee in zoning and we stop the process as soon as we can.

731
01:08:57,594 --> 01:09:00,196
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a motion to refer to planning and permitting committee.

732
01:09:00,416 --> 01:09:04,319
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there any further questions or comment for council or for the planning director?

733
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:08,641
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think so.

734
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:10,643
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I think we eliminate the moratorium.

735
01:09:10,663 --> 01:09:11,624
[SPEAKER_16]: I've taken that out.

736
01:09:11,724 --> 01:09:24,196
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that we restructure the motion to ask to refer this to the zoning, our subcommittee in zoning to draw up the legal and proper terminology to move this forward.

737
01:09:24,576 --> 01:09:24,836
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

738
01:09:25,237 --> 01:09:25,537
[SPEAKER_16]: Second.

739
01:09:26,698 --> 01:09:27,018
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

740
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:30,222
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further questions for council, for members of the council?

741
01:09:31,354 --> 01:09:37,937
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to refer to Planning Committee and Permanent Committee for further discussions around zoning, seconded by Vice President Collins.

742
01:09:39,057 --> 01:09:40,037
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

743
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:43,159
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Callahan?

744
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:43,659
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes.

745
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:46,760
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Collins?

746
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:47,360
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes.

747
01:09:48,561 --> 01:09:49,521
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor San Buenaventura?

748
01:09:49,641 --> 01:09:49,881
[SPEAKER_38]: No.

749
01:09:51,102 --> 01:09:51,442
Madam Mayor?

750
01:09:51,922 --> 01:09:52,222
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

751
01:09:53,082 --> 01:09:54,043
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Scarpelli?

752
01:09:54,243 --> 01:09:54,543
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

753
01:09:55,503 --> 01:09:56,204
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Vang?

754
01:09:56,304 --> 01:09:56,524
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

755
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,762
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, six affirmative, one negative, the motion passes.

756
01:10:02,724 --> 01:10:08,008
[SPEAKER_21]: 24418, recommendation for Medford Affordable Housing Trust Fund Board of Trustees.

757
01:10:08,088 --> 01:10:14,793
[SPEAKER_21]: June 10th, 2024 by electronic delivery regarding recommendation for the Medford Affordable Housing Trust Fund Board of Trustees.

758
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:21,499
[SPEAKER_21]: I respect the request and recommend the honorable body approve the following candidates to serve on the Board of Trustees for the Medford Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

759
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:23,500
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, can you give us some guidance?

760
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:27,442
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that we have residents that have worked very hard on this issue that want to be heard tonight.

761
01:10:28,623 --> 01:10:39,728
[SPEAKER_16]: If there's a possibility that they can express their input and their time and effort they put into this, I would recommend or ask that you would allow them to.

762
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:45,111
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, we just moved through the item and it has been disposed of.

763
01:10:45,932 --> 01:10:49,754
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm happy to take it up under public participation or public participation item from Charles Rodriguez.

764
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:58,377
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so if you want to speak on this, you'll have to wait at the end now to public participation, and you can speak on this.

765
01:11:02,305 --> 01:11:03,186
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm gonna keep reading.

766
01:11:03,366 --> 01:11:07,968
[SPEAKER_21]: In accordance with the MedFed Affordable Housing Trust Fund Ordinance, the Board of Trustees shall be appointed by the Mayor.

767
01:11:08,428 --> 01:11:13,631
[SPEAKER_21]: Upon approval from the City Council, the Board must consist of seven members, including the Mayor or their designee.

768
01:11:13,651 --> 01:11:21,555
[SPEAKER_21]: The Ordinance stipulates that the initial appointment of Trustees must be staggered, with three members serving a one-year term and the remaining four serving a two-year term.

769
01:11:21,615 --> 01:11:25,777
[SPEAKER_21]: Subsequent appointments and reappointments except for the Mayor's seat will be for two-year periods.

770
01:11:25,877 --> 01:11:28,999
[SPEAKER_21]: Below are the six recommended candidates with their initial staggered terms.

771
01:11:29,859 --> 01:11:31,761

01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:49,716
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your consideration.

[SPEAKER_21]: Respectfully submitted, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

780
01:11:54,813 --> 01:12:00,396
[SPEAKER_21]: I would invite the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability Director or the Chief of Staff to present the nominees.

781
01:12:00,456 --> 01:12:00,856
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

782
01:12:05,278 --> 01:12:06,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Bears.

783
01:12:06,939 --> 01:12:11,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Our housing planner, Aditi Mungar, is going to present the candidates.

784
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:11,421
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

785
01:12:11,441 --> 01:12:11,941
[SPEAKER_21]: Welcome, Aditi.

786
01:12:13,154 --> 01:12:14,915
[SPEAKER_51]: Good evening, members of the city council.

787
01:12:15,356 --> 01:12:17,638
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm Aditi Mogul, a staff planner for housing.

788
01:12:17,658 --> 01:12:20,640
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm here in support of the recommended candidates.

789
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:25,084
[SPEAKER_51]: We have most of the candidates present either in person or virtually.

790
01:12:25,604 --> 01:12:29,747
[SPEAKER_51]: I'd like to present Kayla Lason, who's here with us.

791
01:12:31,409 --> 01:12:32,169
[SPEAKER_39]: Welcome.

792
01:12:35,132 --> 01:12:37,754
[SPEAKER_51]: I'd like to introduce Penelope Taylor.

793
01:12:42,898 --> 01:12:45,280
[SPEAKER_51]: I'd also like to introduce Roberta Cameron.

794
01:12:50,104 --> 01:12:55,288
[SPEAKER_51]: We have Lisa Ann Davidson on Zoom, and we also have Lisa's son on Zoom.

795
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:03,434
[SPEAKER_51]: And our sixth candidate, Kerry Weaver, unfortunately is not here due to some scheduling conflict.

796
01:13:04,315 --> 01:13:05,116
[SPEAKER_19]: Got it.

797
01:13:08,018 --> 01:13:08,318
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

798
01:13:08,438 --> 01:13:10,100
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I would have.

799
01:13:17,176 --> 01:13:19,577
[SPEAKER_19]: Please don't disrupt the public meeting we have business to attend to.

800
01:13:19,998 --> 01:13:35,866
[SPEAKER_19]: If a councilor wished to make a... On a motion for councilor to recess for five minutes, seconded by Councilor San Buenaventura, please call the roll.

801
01:13:40,489 --> 01:13:41,810
[SPEAKER_39]: I didn't make anyone do anything.

802
01:13:47,759 --> 01:13:48,980
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you on the recess.

803
01:14:17,253 --> 01:14:17,613
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes.

804
01:14:18,834 --> 01:14:19,055
Yes.

805
01:14:19,155 --> 01:14:19,415
Yes.

806
01:14:19,495 --> 01:14:19,595
Yes.

807
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:19,815
Yes.

808
01:14:44,358 --> 01:14:46,459
[SPEAKER_21]: The motion was disposed of per the council rules.

809
01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:48,820
[SPEAKER_21]: There was a vote that was taken and disposed of it.

810
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:53,461
[SPEAKER_21]: The agenda, I can't call people out of order, that needs to be a vote of the council.

811
01:14:53,982 --> 01:14:57,163
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scott probably could have proposed that, there could have been a second, we could have had a vote on it.

812
01:14:57,343 --> 01:15:00,564
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't just discretionarily move items around, that is not my role.

813
01:15:01,164 --> 01:15:04,685
[SPEAKER_21]: The agenda's written the way it's written, public participation's at the end of the meeting.

814
01:15:09,247 --> 01:15:11,128
[SPEAKER_19]: There was a vote, there was a motion and a vote.

815
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:19,683
[SPEAKER_21]: Once an item is disposed of with a motion and a vote, it is concluded.

816
01:15:21,725 --> 01:15:23,266
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just the rules, thank you.

817
01:15:23,486 --> 01:15:25,227
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, I have to follow the rules.

818
01:15:26,608 --> 01:15:27,869
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to follow the rules.

819
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:30,371
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to follow the rules.

820
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:35,694
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, let's keep yelling personal attacks.

821
01:15:35,714 --> 01:15:36,855
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think that'll get us anywhere.

822
01:15:42,099 --> 01:15:43,200
[SPEAKER_19]: If this is how it's gonna go,

823
01:15:46,983 --> 01:15:49,505
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just following the rules.

824
01:15:49,685 --> 01:15:53,108
[SPEAKER_39]: I can't comment on rumors.

825
01:16:29,781 --> 01:16:31,002
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we're in a good place.

826
01:16:32,143 --> 01:16:33,364
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think this is productive.

827
01:16:33,524 --> 01:16:34,284
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're in a recess.

828
01:16:34,364 --> 01:16:34,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

829
01:35:24,174 --> 01:35:28,117
[SPEAKER_19]: You should, you don't have to do a vote, but yeah, 842, yeah.

830
01:35:32,101 --> 01:35:40,367
[SPEAKER_20]: The Office of Plenary Development and Sustainability has received and reviewed applications for the Board of Trustees and has met applicants to understand their backgrounds and interests in affordable housing.

831
01:35:40,928 --> 01:35:45,171
[SPEAKER_21]: The Affordable Housing Trust Fund will convene once a month on Wednesday with its first meeting to be scheduled in July 2024.

832
01:35:45,211 --> 01:35:50,055
[SPEAKER_21]: The specific date for monthly meetings will be determined after consultation with the trustees.

833
01:35:51,021 --> 01:35:55,823
[SPEAKER_21]: The trust may establish a subcommittee or a working group that will meet more frequently to develop an action plan for the trust.

834
01:35:59,824 --> 01:36:03,145
[SPEAKER_21]: Below are the six recommended candidates with their initial staggered terms.

835
01:36:03,265 --> 01:36:04,585

873
01:39:05,857 --> 01:39:11,362

874
01:39:11,502 --> 01:39:16,787
[SPEAKER_11]: I looked through the descriptions of everybody.

875
01:39:18,462 --> 01:39:24,346
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that I spent a lot of time just focusing on, you know, trying to find good people for the board.

876
01:39:24,406 --> 01:39:29,730
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like everybody here is far, far more qualified than

877
01:39:31,414 --> 01:39:34,655
[SPEAKER_11]: when it comes to anything related to affordable housing.

878
01:39:35,156 --> 01:39:41,598

879
01:39:41,658 --> 01:39:45,759

880
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:58,864

01:39:58,904 --> 01:39:59,264

887

[SPEAKER_29]: This project has been in the works for a long time.

888
01:40:19,116 --> 01:40:25,059
[SPEAKER_29]: This was first proposed by former Council President John Falco, I believe, and it was voted on in the Council's previous term.

889
01:40:25,580 --> 01:40:31,023
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm so glad to reach this point where we are putting some people power to this mechanism.

890
01:40:31,043 --> 01:40:31,663
[SPEAKER_29]: And I,

891
01:40:33,144 --> 01:40:35,545
[SPEAKER_29]: really enjoyed reading over this paper over the weekend.

892
01:40:35,725 --> 01:40:41,349
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, this is a crew with such an incredible list of housing and affordable housing bona fides.

893
01:40:41,409 --> 01:41:00,019
[SPEAKER_29]: It makes me really proud to know that there are so many people like this in our community, and not just with these skills and experiences, but also willing to throw their hat in the ring and say, yes, I'll step up, I'll work hard to take on this really quite technical, detailed, you know,

894
01:41:01,212 --> 01:41:03,563
[SPEAKER_29]: issue of affordable housing and doing it right in our community.

895
01:41:06,304 --> 01:41:09,505
[SPEAKER_29]: It's not something you to show up and volunteer for an hour and then go on your way.

896
01:41:09,545 --> 01:41:13,747
[SPEAKER_29]: This requires volunteering, like real, real skill and thoughtfulness.

897
01:41:14,447 --> 01:41:21,289
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm really happy to see all these appointees coming in with kind of an incredible level of professional experience to lend to this trust.

898
01:41:22,750 --> 01:41:28,012
[SPEAKER_29]: This is a really wonderful cohort to start off our Affordable Housing Trust with.

899
01:41:28,132 --> 01:41:29,772

903
01:41:46,057 --> 01:41:46,657
[SPEAKER_28]: Motion to approve.

904
01:41:47,178 --> 01:42:00,147
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing none, there's a motion by Vice President Collins to approve the appointments of Kayla Lessin, Roberta Cameron, Lisa Ann Davidson, Carrie Weaver, Lisa Sun, and Penelope Taylor to the Affordable Housing Trust, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

905
01:42:01,868 --> 01:42:03,410
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

906
01:42:06,252 --> 01:42:06,472
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes.

907
01:42:09,462 --> 01:42:09,722
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

908
01:42:22,490 --> 01:42:22,730

[SPEAKER_51]: Thank you so much.

913
01:42:49,135 --> 01:42:50,155
[SPEAKER_20]: 24423, if I don't hear a motion.

914
01:42:50,175 --> 01:42:55,098
[SPEAKER_21]: 24423, recommendation for Community Preservation Committee appointment request.

915
01:42:55,918 --> 01:43:06,784
[SPEAKER_21]: Dear President Grayson, members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend your Honorable Bobby confirm the appointment of Ada Gunning of 40 Magoon Avenue to the Community Preservation Committee for a term of three years, effective July 1, 2024.

916
01:43:08,224 --> 01:43:09,745
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

917
01:43:09,765 --> 01:43:11,006
[SPEAKER_21]: May it be an illegal current.

918
01:43:11,746 --> 01:43:14,928
[SPEAKER_21]: And we have Manager DuPont of the Community Preservation Committee.

919
01:43:15,379 --> 01:43:16,320
[SPEAKER_36]: Hello, everybody.

920
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,041
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you so much for your time tonight.

921
01:43:18,141 --> 01:43:23,906
[SPEAKER_36]: We do have Ada on Zoom, but we are excited to have her join our committee.

922
01:43:25,467 --> 01:43:33,734
[SPEAKER_36]: If she would like to speak, I don't want to steal her thunder, but we're excited of her experiences she's going to bring in terms of being a leader on a committee.

923
01:43:34,975 --> 01:43:40,759
[SPEAKER_36]: She has served on a clinical social work committee before.

924
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:43,562
[SPEAKER_36]: She's a huge advocate here in the city and

925
01:43:44,580 --> 01:43:51,844
[SPEAKER_36]: If Ada has raised her hand, I don't wanna, like I said, I still thunder inadvertently all the time, so I try not to do that.

926
01:43:53,805 --> 01:43:54,605
[SPEAKER_19]: We have Ada here.

927
01:43:54,625 --> 01:43:55,866
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi everyone.

928
01:43:56,967 --> 01:44:01,289
[SPEAKER_21]: I've already said it, name and address for the record, and your time is yours.

929
01:44:01,869 --> 01:44:02,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

930
01:44:02,289 --> 01:44:09,453
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Ada Gunning, 40 Magoon Avenue, and I just wanted to thank you all for the opportunity to serve Medford in this way.

931
01:44:09,473 --> 01:44:10,534
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited.

932
01:44:11,694 --> 01:44:22,979
[SPEAKER_00]: I come to this as a parent of young children who was really excited to figure out how to expand recreational spaces and then learned more about the CPC as I went along, and I'm just very excited to tap in.

933
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:24,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

934
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:26,080
[SPEAKER_21]: Fantastic.

935
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:27,621
[SPEAKER_21]: Any questions?

936
01:44:27,721 --> 01:44:29,122
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Leming, Vice President Collins.

937
01:44:30,642 --> 01:44:38,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Just wanted to say, I remember back when I was getting my appointment to the CPA,

938
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:50,591
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember I waited in this room until about one, one o'clock in the morning, watching a very good meeting.

939
01:44:51,111 --> 01:45:03,278
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a great meeting, but also just say that when I saw at his name on the, on the agenda, I was kind of thinking like, you know, I really don't want to have somebody else go through that.

940
01:45:03,539 --> 01:45:06,761
[SPEAKER_11]: That's, that's not, not always the,

941
01:45:07,441 --> 01:45:08,641
[SPEAKER_11]: most pleasant thing to go through.

942
01:45:08,681 --> 01:45:21,166
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was kind of behind the scenes asking folks to do that, to move this paper out of order just so that she didn't also have to wait till one in the morning to get appointed.

943
01:45:21,206 --> 01:45:34,311
[SPEAKER_11]: But just wanted to say right over your resume, I think it's wonderful to have a social worker with heights of the community on the CPA and I know you'll do good work there.

944
01:45:34,331 --> 01:45:37,032
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, that's all I got.

945
01:45:38,991 --> 01:45:39,772
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Collins.

946
01:45:40,553 --> 01:45:41,333
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, President Bares.

947
01:45:41,413 --> 01:45:42,394
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you so much for being here.

948
01:45:42,414 --> 01:45:50,302
[SPEAKER_29]: Again, it's great to see a candidate that comes to our community with a unique perspective.

949
01:45:51,203 --> 01:45:57,369
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think that will bring a unique perspective to how to leverage our CPA funds to the greatest use for our community.

950
01:45:58,731 --> 01:46:01,734
[SPEAKER_29]: So pending further comment by my fellow counselors, I would motion to approve.

951
01:46:03,447 --> 01:46:07,668
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion to approve by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

952
01:46:08,168 --> 01:46:09,369
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

953
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:15,730
Yes.

954
01:46:16,471 --> 01:46:16,651
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

955
01:46:35,462 --> 01:46:35,782
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

956
01:46:40,746 --> 01:46:43,869
[SPEAKER_34]: And yes, me too.

957
01:46:44,149 --> 01:46:44,329
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

958
01:46:44,829 --> 01:46:45,010
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

959
01:46:45,050 --> 01:46:45,490
[SPEAKER_21]: Six.

960
01:46:45,510 --> 01:46:47,572
[SPEAKER_21]: The motion is approved.

961
01:46:48,953 --> 01:46:49,433
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

962
01:46:49,453 --> 01:46:56,198
[SPEAKER_21]: While we're on the suspension, Councilor Scarpelli is moved to take public participation.

963
01:46:56,218 --> 01:46:56,939
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

964
01:46:59,588 --> 01:47:00,530
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello, participation.

965
01:47:00,550 --> 01:47:03,195
[SPEAKER_21]: We have Cheryl Rodriguez.

966
01:47:04,437 --> 01:47:05,860
[SPEAKER_21]: Name and address for the record, please.

967
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:06,541
[SPEAKER_21]: You have three minutes.

968
01:47:07,782 --> 01:47:09,623
[SPEAKER_30]: Charles Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

969
01:47:10,183 --> 01:47:12,765
[SPEAKER_30]: I just wanted to mention the withdrawal letter from Habit.

970
01:47:13,005 --> 01:47:19,329
[SPEAKER_30]: I mentioned adversity as the reason for the withdrawal, which makes an ordinance for methadone even more important than ever.

971
01:47:19,889 --> 01:47:28,994
[SPEAKER_30]: Under our current zoning, this can open with minimal notification and no wide community notice anywhere with a simple permit for a medical facility.

972
01:47:29,395 --> 01:47:33,097
[SPEAKER_30]: An opioid dispensary can just open with virtually no one knowing until it's too late.

973
01:47:33,597 --> 01:47:35,278
[SPEAKER_30]: Only 10 people were notified,

974
01:47:35,759 --> 01:47:41,447
[SPEAKER_30]: that a medical facility was gonna open at 360 Salem Street, and it's actually a methadone dispensary.

975
01:47:42,789 --> 01:47:47,496
[SPEAKER_30]: While they've pulled the application, they can submit it and be on the agenda for the July meeting.

976
01:47:47,576 --> 01:47:49,840
[SPEAKER_30]: So this isn't over, we need an ordinance.

977
01:47:53,837 --> 01:47:57,382
[SPEAKER_30]: Medford needs a specific use on the use table for this methadone dispensary.

978
01:47:57,502 --> 01:48:04,631
[SPEAKER_30]: The obvious limitations already exist in our pot ordinance, only in commercial two or industrial one zone, nowhere else.

979
01:48:05,212 --> 01:48:09,277
[SPEAKER_30]: If we won't allow pot in our neighborhoods, then why would we allow opioid dispensaries?

980
01:48:10,370 --> 01:48:12,231
[SPEAKER_30]: You must move to change the zoning now.

981
01:48:12,351 --> 01:48:23,497
[SPEAKER_30]: Otherwise, a for-profit company will look for the cheapest real estate, even in the middle of a residential area where it doesn't belong, and just seek to open with minimal notice as a medical facility.

982
01:48:24,057 --> 01:48:39,205
[SPEAKER_30]: They need not provide any medical attention or treatment, merely a pill dispensed from a for-profit vendor whose purpose is to file as many claims for as many doses as they can to make a larger profit without regard for the neighborhood.

983
01:48:40,219 --> 01:48:44,923
[SPEAKER_30]: Habit opened in Springfield on a street with two treatment centers in existence with no issues.

984
01:48:45,383 --> 01:48:51,949
[SPEAKER_30]: Suddenly there was open drug use, prostitution, drug dealers, and other crime that was described as an open air drug market.

985
01:48:52,470 --> 01:48:57,114
[SPEAKER_30]: The police chief increased patrols in the area and drove crime into the neighboring streets.

986
01:48:58,120 --> 01:49:01,021
[SPEAKER_30]: which here would all be residential.

987
01:49:01,381 --> 01:49:07,303
[SPEAKER_30]: Efforts by the city to reach Habit were ignored, and then the press moved on and left the neighbors to deal with the pain.

988
01:49:08,283 --> 01:49:12,525
[SPEAKER_30]: Habit has an opioid dispensary at Mass and Cass, and it too is an open air drug market.

989
01:49:12,905 --> 01:49:20,107
[SPEAKER_30]: The Globe and the Herald recently reported that the police attempting to stop the open drug use found that it just moved over a few blocks.

990
01:49:20,527 --> 01:49:23,509
[SPEAKER_30]: and then moved back when they tried to disperse them from the area.

991
01:49:24,130 --> 01:49:31,616
[SPEAKER_30]: What impact will this have on any recovering addicts who live in our neighborhood and now have to be exposed to open drug use where they live?

992
01:49:32,036 --> 01:49:40,482
[SPEAKER_30]: And what impact on others living in the area or the dancing school or the nearby restaurant or the elementary school that has nearly 600 children?

993
01:49:41,043 --> 01:49:46,967
[SPEAKER_30]: The neighborhood has been fighting to be heard and is the only reason that we even know this project was on the agenda.

994
01:49:48,148 --> 01:49:49,250
[SPEAKER_30]: 10 people were notified.

995
01:49:49,630 --> 01:49:54,254
[SPEAKER_30]: Multiple people have printed and delivered flyers, they have picketed, they have collected signatures.

996
01:49:54,775 --> 01:50:02,622
[SPEAKER_30]: Under the current application, as only a medical facility, the city is not required to provide a community meeting as they would with a pot dispensary.

997
01:50:03,263 --> 01:50:09,808
[SPEAKER_30]: This business that will harm entire neighborhoods and the current zoning allows them to only notify 10 people?

998
01:50:10,328 --> 01:50:11,189
[SPEAKER_30]: This is a mistake.

999
01:50:11,689 --> 01:50:12,850
[SPEAKER_30]: This is missing zoning.

1000
01:50:13,370 --> 01:50:19,135
[SPEAKER_30]: This should only be allowed in commercial 2 and industrial 1, just as a pot dispensary is limited.

1001
01:50:19,815 --> 01:50:22,097
[SPEAKER_30]: A community meeting should also have been required.

1002
01:50:22,698 --> 01:50:26,322
[SPEAKER_30]: Regular oversight should occur in order to keep that permit.

1003
01:50:26,622 --> 01:50:30,326
[SPEAKER_30]: It should not be an easy process as it could potentially destroy a neighborhood.

1004
01:50:30,786 --> 01:50:37,413
[SPEAKER_30]: No neighborhood should have to roll the dice and hope HABIT won't operate as they normally do to the extreme detriment of those around them.

1005
01:50:37,893 --> 01:50:40,336
[SPEAKER_30]: We need to be aware that this application will return.

1006
01:50:40,396 --> 01:50:42,278
[SPEAKER_30]: They have already said they're coming to Medford.

1007
01:50:42,959 --> 01:50:43,299
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1008
01:50:49,073 --> 01:50:49,353
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1009
01:50:49,373 --> 01:50:51,055
[SPEAKER_22]: Name and address for the record, you have three minutes.

1010
01:50:51,515 --> 01:50:52,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Joan Lemler.

1011
01:50:52,936 --> 01:50:55,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from 56 Farragut Avenue here in Medford.

1012
01:50:56,079 --> 01:50:59,381
[SPEAKER_02]: You all saw me rather late on, I believe it was the 11th.

1013
01:51:00,662 --> 01:51:04,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really here to address the process going forward.

1014
01:51:05,206 --> 01:51:07,488
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an incredible opportunity here.

1015
01:51:07,828 --> 01:51:17,056
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of energy and spirit that I've seen amongst all kinds of stakeholders in the last three weeks has been really impressive.

1016
01:51:17,512 --> 01:51:18,172
[SPEAKER_02]: and heartening.

1017
01:51:19,093 --> 01:51:33,643
[SPEAKER_02]: And my question is, how do we mobilize this to really ensure that the I know it's the four R's, you know, I'm not going to go into that again, because you've all read about it, heard about it, and a lot of people talking about the four R's.

1018
01:51:34,463 --> 01:51:52,786
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm hearing that the provider, in this case, HabitO has withdrawn their application, but it still sounds like, you know, Cheryl was mentioning, they're still intending to partner with all the parties that be to pick another place.

1019
01:51:53,581 --> 01:52:01,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, which groups work on really deciding right treatment, right time, right place, and right provider?

1020
01:52:01,973 --> 01:52:03,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Has that already been decided?

1021
01:52:04,477 --> 01:52:06,360
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I know I had homework last time.

1022
01:52:06,740 --> 01:52:10,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I was referred to the Department of Health here.

1023
01:52:10,424 --> 01:52:16,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't call the director yet because I was a little busy with everybody else working real hard in the last few weeks.

1024
01:52:17,410 --> 01:52:22,515
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I really, you know, I started looking at all the boards and commissions.

1025
01:52:22,775 --> 01:52:24,376
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 39 in Medford.

1026
01:52:24,616 --> 01:52:25,677
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just a lot of them.

1027
01:52:26,918 --> 01:52:35,146
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, there's one for the health department, you know, there's also one for mental health and also one for disabilities.

1028
01:52:35,786 --> 01:52:36,026
[SPEAKER_02]: And it,

1029
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:45,971
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of hard for me to figure out what these different groups were doing and what part they played, perhaps, in this whole process.

1030
01:52:46,431 --> 01:53:05,319
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to their meetings and their minutes, and some of them, maybe they haven't been too active lately or they don't have enough members, but that one that deals with mental health and prevention, there's like a roster of 10 people or more, very talented people from all sorts of sectors.

1031
01:53:06,379 --> 01:53:12,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they mobilized to really look at the issue of drug use, abuse and addiction?

1032
01:53:12,945 --> 01:53:15,627
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much, you know, so many resources here.

1033
01:53:16,608 --> 01:53:18,469
[SPEAKER_02]: How is this going to go forward?

1034
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:22,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have a question of where do we go from here?

1035
01:53:23,273 --> 01:53:30,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is all the energy going to be poured into simply finding another place for this particular provider?

1036
01:53:31,283 --> 01:53:32,084
[SPEAKER_19]: You have 30 seconds.

1037
01:53:32,384 --> 01:53:32,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1038
01:53:33,405 --> 01:53:50,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So I caution all the parties and just hope that we can mobilize our energy to really make the right decision and not just focus in on one particular provider, one particular type of program.

1039
01:53:51,342 --> 01:53:53,945
[SPEAKER_02]: And I pledge myself to work hard on it.

1040
01:53:56,104 --> 01:54:01,967
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, and just, I can answer some of your question if you want, in terms of procedurally next steps.

1041
01:54:02,027 --> 01:54:12,772
[SPEAKER_21]: So the council voted on the paper that had been proposed, and we'll be looking at the zoning element of this, which is within our purview, and what the state law allows us to do, what the legal cases allow us to do.

1042
01:54:13,272 --> 01:54:24,718
[SPEAKER_21]: In terms of, in general, prevention, health, addressing substance use disorder, and the opioid crisis, we do have the Office of Prevention and Outreach, which has done some really great work on that in this city.

1043
01:54:25,878 --> 01:54:32,967
[SPEAKER_21]: and they convened the Preserving Mental and Behavioral Health Commission, which we established three or so years ago.

1044
01:54:32,987 --> 01:54:45,241
[SPEAKER_21]: In terms of the rights of providers, right, I get the four R's, and I think it's important for the city to engage in looking at that, but the provider themselves as a corporate entity, non-profit or for-profit,

1045
01:54:45,802 --> 01:54:50,164
[SPEAKER_21]: they do have a right to petition for zoning or to want to open a business or something like that.

1046
01:54:50,204 --> 01:54:52,966
[SPEAKER_21]: So the city can't control them from coming and asking.

1047
01:54:53,426 --> 01:54:56,067
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we have to follow the laws of the public process as laid out.

1048
01:54:57,288 --> 01:55:04,671
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think that's why you found, you know, that there's all this, you know, there was a special permit of the zoning board for this use in this district.

1049
01:55:05,071 --> 01:55:14,356
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's the process that outlines there, what has to happen there, engaging those other bodies, you know, in a more holistic look at mental health and behavioral health.

1050
01:55:14,876 --> 01:55:20,924
[SPEAKER_21]: That is the work of the Office of Prevention and Outreach, but they don't actually have approval or denial authority over special permits.

1051
01:55:21,585 --> 01:55:28,173
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's why there's some mismatch there and why certain groups are engaged in certain elements of the process.

1052
01:55:32,198 --> 01:55:33,460
[SPEAKER_21]: Name and address for the record, please.

1053
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:37,122
[SPEAKER_25]: Patricia Ciapelli, 53 Garfield Avenue.

1054
01:55:37,862 --> 01:55:43,286
[SPEAKER_25]: As an abutter to the methadone dosing facility at the end of my street, I was never notified.

1055
01:55:43,807 --> 01:55:47,929
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a reason why legal notices are to be sent certified mail.

1056
01:55:48,650 --> 01:56:02,940
[SPEAKER_25]: Then imagine my surprise when I find out this firm is the same firm that has wreaked havoc in Lynn, Springfield, Lowell, and Boston, Mass and Cass, where people defecate and urinate in the streets, and the engagement center had to be closed because the employees were afraid to go to work.

1057
01:56:03,973 --> 01:56:14,416
[SPEAKER_25]: We have gathered hundreds of voters' signatures, hundreds, over the past few weeks against this facility coming to our neighborhood, and we will continue to gather more.

1058
01:56:15,056 --> 01:56:22,679
[SPEAKER_25]: People from North Medford, West Medford, Brooks, Lawrence Estates area, when we asked them, why are you signing our petition?

1059
01:56:22,979 --> 01:56:24,959
[SPEAKER_25]: This doesn't affect you or your neighborhood.

1060
01:56:25,359 --> 01:56:28,820
[SPEAKER_25]: They responded, it's Medford, and we've heard about this company.

1061
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:30,341
[SPEAKER_25]: We don't want them in Medford.

1062
01:56:31,448 --> 01:56:34,790
[SPEAKER_25]: We already assist those afflicted with this horrible disease.

1063
01:56:34,870 --> 01:56:39,033
[SPEAKER_25]: We have 10 locations within two miles of just downtown Medford.

1064
01:56:39,974 --> 01:56:47,379
[SPEAKER_25]: You recently asked for a 2.5% override for our taxes to fund the schools for additional programs because you care about our children.

1065
01:56:47,839 --> 01:56:48,479
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you really?

1066
01:56:48,499 --> 01:56:54,784
[SPEAKER_25]: Does putting a methadone dosing facility 0.2 miles from an elementary school speak to your care for the children?

1067
01:56:55,564 --> 01:57:00,988
[SPEAKER_25]: Or is prostitution and walking through needles on the street to get to school a new program of education you are offering?

1068
01:57:02,289 --> 01:57:06,032
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't believe you let Habit Opco be in charge of their own traffic study.

1069
01:57:07,033 --> 01:57:08,815
[SPEAKER_25]: This is a horrible way to run the city.

1070
01:57:09,015 --> 01:57:16,001
[SPEAKER_25]: We trust you to provide a checks and balances on how you produce your business and how you make your decisions.

1071
01:57:16,381 --> 01:57:20,946
[SPEAKER_25]: You are the equivalent of a publicly held company and we are your stakeholders.

1072
01:57:21,606 --> 01:57:26,290
[SPEAKER_25]: You owe us the complete transparency on information and financing.

1073
01:57:27,131 --> 01:57:36,539
[SPEAKER_25]: Recently, the Administration for Children and Families, a division of Health and Human Services, recently held a human trafficking and the opioid crisis webinar conference.

1074
01:57:36,959 --> 01:57:43,664
[SPEAKER_25]: Dr. Catherine Chong stated, there is an intersection where opioid users and human trafficking cross.

1075
01:57:44,585 --> 01:57:57,796
[SPEAKER_25]: We have learned that human traffickers are increasingly recruiting in drug rehabilitation facilities and other similar programs because they see the vulnerability when someone is trying to recover from opioid or substance use.

1076
01:57:58,356 --> 01:58:04,701
[SPEAKER_25]: They are also focusing on the parents that come to those facilities and exploit their children.

1077
01:58:05,202 --> 01:58:12,268
[SPEAKER_25]: How do we know this would stop here, given the close proximity to any neighborhood or elementary school where they want to come back?

1078
01:58:13,171 --> 01:58:15,973
[SPEAKER_25]: The Glenwood area has received your message loud and clear.

1079
01:58:16,033 --> 01:58:19,055
[SPEAKER_25]: We are a racially, ethnically, and economically diverse neighborhood.

1080
01:58:19,495 --> 01:58:22,537
[SPEAKER_25]: It is clear you are blatantly discriminating against us.

1081
01:58:22,977 --> 01:58:26,739
[SPEAKER_25]: You may be the Our Revolution, but we are the Take Back Medford.

1082
01:58:27,059 --> 01:58:27,800
[SPEAKER_25]: Nice to meet you.

1083
01:58:29,517 --> 01:58:29,977
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1084
01:58:30,297 --> 01:58:36,379
[SPEAKER_22]: I would just note that the City Council does not have the authority or control over pretty much anything that was just stated.

1085
01:58:37,019 --> 01:58:37,979
[SPEAKER_22]: Name and address for the record, please.

1086
01:58:37,999 --> 01:58:38,880
[SPEAKER_26]: You have three minutes.

1087
01:58:38,940 --> 01:58:41,140
[SPEAKER_26]: Jennifer O'Callaghan, 19 Power Street.

1088
01:58:41,580 --> 01:58:46,122
[SPEAKER_26]: I just want to emphasize initially, as a direct debater, that this is far from over.

1089
01:58:46,462 --> 01:58:56,264
[SPEAKER_26]: We need appropriate zoning to take place, and the fact that it hasn't yet, knowing that these types of facilities would be coming and looking, is disgraceful.

1090
01:58:57,285 --> 01:58:58,265
[SPEAKER_26]: I also want to

1091
01:58:59,446 --> 01:59:08,874
[SPEAKER_26]: express the fact that as a director butter I did not receive notification and so many like many others I discovered this through my neighbors.

1092
01:59:09,535 --> 01:59:12,177
[SPEAKER_26]: I did receive the subsequent notification.

1093
01:59:12,197 --> 01:59:15,420
[SPEAKER_26]: They came out about these meetings.

1094
01:59:16,301 --> 01:59:17,942
[SPEAKER_26]: In totality.

1095
01:59:17,962 --> 01:59:26,970
[SPEAKER_26]: It's the wrong location being so close to schools and other amenities for children families elderly and disabled people.

1096
01:59:28,021 --> 01:59:39,430
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm very disappointed that it hasn't been more done knowing that Medford was receiving money to deal with substance use disorders.

1097
01:59:40,130 --> 01:59:56,362
[SPEAKER_26]: So knowing not a for-profit company that's a bad actor across the state and across the country, yet being out of Tennessee, more wasn't done to prepare for such a situation.

1098
01:59:57,367 --> 02:00:05,992
[SPEAKER_26]: So please do the right thing and get on your efforts to zone and expect to hear more from our community.

1099
02:00:06,232 --> 02:00:06,673
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1100
02:00:07,233 --> 02:00:07,673
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1101
02:00:09,955 --> 02:00:11,636
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to go to Zoom.

1102
02:00:11,716 --> 02:00:13,977
[SPEAKER_21]: Marie Izzo, name and address for the record, please.

1103
02:00:13,997 --> 02:00:18,660
[SPEAKER_21]: If someone could unmute Marie, for some reason I'm not a co-host right now.

1104
02:00:25,014 --> 02:00:25,635
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, sorry.

1105
02:00:26,095 --> 02:00:28,997
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, Marie Izzo, Pilgrim Road, Medford Mass.

1106
02:00:31,179 --> 02:00:44,050
[SPEAKER_23]: So like everyone else here, I understand they have withdrawn, but I do believe that there's an urgent need for treatment in Medford and in the rest of the United States for opioid addiction.

1107
02:00:44,651 --> 02:00:48,554
[SPEAKER_23]: To disallow any treatment modality is inappropriate and unfair.

1108
02:00:49,355 --> 02:00:52,376
[SPEAKER_23]: There's no one way to recover from addiction, period.

1109
02:00:52,516 --> 02:00:55,897
[SPEAKER_23]: And it is a lifetime commitment, regardless of what modality is used.

1110
02:00:56,557 --> 02:01:01,579
[SPEAKER_23]: There's been a lot of misinformation that has been spread related to the number of clinics already in Medford.

1111
02:01:02,079 --> 02:01:02,959
[SPEAKER_23]: I heard five.

1112
02:01:03,159 --> 02:01:06,520
[SPEAKER_23]: Now I've heard there are at least 10 locations within two miles.

1113
02:01:07,180 --> 02:01:13,345
[SPEAKER_23]: I wonder why they would want to come to Medford if there are 10 locations of other methadone programs within two miles.

1114
02:01:14,105 --> 02:01:24,033
[SPEAKER_23]: I was a regional manager involved in hiring of staff, and I can assure you, so I worked for Habit Management before it was purchased by Bain Capital and now Acadia Health.

1115
02:01:25,514 --> 02:01:27,396
[SPEAKER_23]: So I was involved in hiring of staff.

1116
02:01:27,456 --> 02:01:34,322
[SPEAKER_23]: I can assure you that I hired fine doctors, nurses, and clinicians, and I was very proud of staff and clients.

1117
02:01:34,482 --> 02:01:38,746
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm deeply disturbed by how these clinics have been referred to as dispensaries.

1118
02:01:38,926 --> 02:01:41,549
[SPEAKER_23]: They are absolutely not dispensaries only.

1119
02:01:42,269 --> 02:01:53,223
[SPEAKER_23]: In fact, all methadone programs, profit or nonprofit, make 99% of their income from counseling by licensed mental health clinicians, social workers, and certified addiction staff.

1120
02:01:53,363 --> 02:01:53,743
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1121
02:01:54,204 --> 02:01:56,887
[SPEAKER_23]: I also want to mention that the mass and caste problem

1122
02:01:57,708 --> 02:02:00,670
[SPEAKER_23]: has nothing to do with habit management.

1123
02:02:00,810 --> 02:02:12,518
[SPEAKER_23]: That has to do with victory programs that were closed many years ago by Marty Walsh, and that victory programs involved substance abuse and mostly unhoused.

1124
02:02:13,158 --> 02:02:24,087
[SPEAKER_23]: And when given the fact that we do have a housing crisis, and these are not people necessarily that are getting treatment because you can't get treatment and show up that way.

1125
02:02:24,827 --> 02:02:31,353
[SPEAKER_23]: You can be homeless, but you have to be in pretty good shape before anyone is going to give you any dose of any medication.

1126
02:02:31,913 --> 02:02:36,136
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is a housing issue at Mass and Cas and has nothing to do.

1127
02:02:36,937 --> 02:02:48,400
[SPEAKER_23]: So there is a methadone program at Boston Medical Center, which may or may not have contributed to that, but mostly that is a homeless population and people with serious, serious mental health issues.

1128
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:58,442
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm sorry to say that we have plenty of people in Medford that would need some intervention with both in the area of recovery and mental health.

1129
02:02:58,682 --> 02:02:59,103
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1130
02:02:59,123 --> 02:03:04,224
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, thank you.

1131
02:03:05,592 --> 02:03:07,254
[SPEAKER_19]: Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

1132
02:03:07,494 --> 02:03:08,475
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Wally Nuzzo.

1133
02:03:08,535 --> 02:03:09,455
[SPEAKER_09]: I live on Parris Street.

1134
02:03:10,116 --> 02:03:11,437
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm ultra proud to be brief.

1135
02:03:11,517 --> 02:03:12,518
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate public speaking.

1136
02:03:13,879 --> 02:03:16,862
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to mention something that the last person said.

1137
02:03:17,182 --> 02:03:19,364
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not a clinic.

1138
02:03:19,885 --> 02:03:25,430
[SPEAKER_09]: This company only opens medical distribution centers.

1139
02:03:25,530 --> 02:03:27,432
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no treatment that's going to be happening there.

1140
02:03:28,311 --> 02:03:39,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Other than that, the fact that this company pulled their request today as a construction professional, I can tell you, they can apply again tomorrow for the same space with the same listings.

1141
02:03:41,287 --> 02:03:45,052
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had to close in a porch and I had to let

1142
02:03:45,848 --> 02:03:48,930
[SPEAKER_09]: people within 400 feet of a residential dwelling.

1143
02:03:48,990 --> 02:03:50,491
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's pathetic.

1144
02:03:50,611 --> 02:03:53,192
[SPEAKER_09]: The amount of people that were not mentioned here.

1145
02:03:53,913 --> 02:04:01,197
[SPEAKER_09]: And also it was pathetic that for every other motion, this, this council body open the floor for public speaking.

1146
02:04:01,738 --> 02:04:07,141
[SPEAKER_09]: And on the one thing that three quarters of the people that were in this room came to say, you skipped over it.

1147
02:04:07,441 --> 02:04:08,262
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a disgrace.

1148
02:04:08,582 --> 02:04:08,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1149
02:04:14,929 --> 02:04:25,411
[SPEAKER_21]: Name is Zoom, Jess H. And I will note that if there is a reapplication, it would have to follow the public process and there would be a special permit process with the Zoning Board of Appeals.

1150
02:04:27,492 --> 02:04:28,272
[SPEAKER_21]: Jess, you have three minutes.

1151
02:04:28,572 --> 02:04:29,732
[SPEAKER_21]: Name and address for the record, please.

1152
02:04:31,892 --> 02:04:34,553
[SPEAKER_35]: Jessica Healy, Four Lock Road, Medford.

1153
02:04:36,013 --> 02:04:39,334
[SPEAKER_35]: I just wanna talk about the, it is a methadone clinic.

1154
02:04:39,494 --> 02:04:40,654
[SPEAKER_35]: It is a dispensary.

1155
02:04:41,814 --> 02:04:44,635
[SPEAKER_35]: Someone who is, I am on,

1156
02:04:45,330 --> 02:04:49,072
[SPEAKER_35]: Matt, but there's a big difference.

1157
02:04:49,152 --> 02:04:49,612
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know.

1158
02:04:49,732 --> 02:04:52,933
[SPEAKER_35]: No one has brought up is the suboxone clinics.

1159
02:04:53,734 --> 02:04:58,576
[SPEAKER_35]: They're a lot different than methadone clinics, methadone clinics.

1160
02:04:59,096 --> 02:05:08,180
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, a lot of people go there and dose in the morning because they're sick and then their drug dealers will meet them at the methadone clinic.

1161
02:05:09,941 --> 02:05:13,302
[SPEAKER_35]: They do not offer a lot of treatment at all.

1162
02:05:14,448 --> 02:05:16,529
[SPEAKER_35]: It's mostly just dosing and leaving.

1163
02:05:17,570 --> 02:05:21,352
[SPEAKER_35]: You have to get 15 minutes a month of therapy.

1164
02:05:23,113 --> 02:05:32,819
[SPEAKER_35]: So it is a detrimental place to have near a school, near a dance, near residents.

1165
02:05:35,641 --> 02:05:41,444
[SPEAKER_35]: I just want to know, has anyone, you know, you want to help people

1166
02:05:41,946 --> 02:05:44,467
[SPEAKER_35]: with opioid issues, which I understand completely.

1167
02:05:45,147 --> 02:05:48,549
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm on the program, but Suboxone is a lot different.

1168
02:05:49,949 --> 02:05:53,471
[SPEAKER_35]: It is, people come, they get their prescription, they leave.

1169
02:05:53,731 --> 02:05:55,652
[SPEAKER_35]: They can come every week, every two weeks.

1170
02:05:56,712 --> 02:05:58,793
[SPEAKER_35]: Methadone is a daily dosing place.

1171
02:05:58,813 --> 02:06:00,113
[SPEAKER_35]: And that's what it is.

1172
02:06:00,133 --> 02:06:02,954
[SPEAKER_35]: It's not a medical center or whatever you wanna call it.

1173
02:06:06,296 --> 02:06:10,578
[SPEAKER_35]: So I'm wondering who I could reach out to, to talk more about this.

1174
02:06:12,153 --> 02:06:12,573
[SPEAKER_35]: issue.

1175
02:06:13,253 --> 02:06:25,018
[SPEAKER_35]: I think if you really want to put a methadone clinic in Medford, over on Mystic Valley Parkway, there's the old Gold's Gym right near the courthouse and the state police.

1176
02:06:26,118 --> 02:06:27,758
[SPEAKER_35]: That might be a better option.

1177
02:06:30,019 --> 02:06:32,180
[SPEAKER_35]: But I have to disagree with Ms.

1178
02:06:32,340 --> 02:06:32,740
[SPEAKER_35]: Izzo.

1179
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:40,503
[SPEAKER_35]: Methadone clinics are notorious for drug dealers showing up because they know people are just dosing in the morning

1180
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:43,561
[SPEAKER_35]: to get through so they can meet them.

1181
02:06:44,541 --> 02:06:48,762
[SPEAKER_35]: So is there someone that I could reach out to regarding this?

1182
02:06:51,342 --> 02:06:55,243
[SPEAKER_21]: The Office of Prevention and Outreach does work on this and the health department.

1183
02:06:56,524 --> 02:07:01,225
[SPEAKER_21]: And in terms of the application, the city did not solicit this private business to apply for this.

1184
02:07:01,285 --> 02:07:04,986
[SPEAKER_21]: They decided to apply for it.

1185
02:07:05,946 --> 02:07:07,246
[SPEAKER_35]: So who would okay it though?

1186
02:07:07,266 --> 02:07:10,947
[SPEAKER_35]: Like if they come back and say, listen, we wanna find another place in Medford,

1187
02:07:12,401 --> 02:07:15,582
[SPEAKER_35]: Who would have to pay that right now?

1188
02:07:15,602 --> 02:07:16,942
[SPEAKER_21]: It's based on the zoning.

1189
02:07:17,002 --> 02:07:24,545
[SPEAKER_21]: If they wanted to go back to the site, if they were, for example, to reapply, the zoning board of appeals would approve a special permit for this use in that district.

1190
02:07:25,565 --> 02:07:25,905
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay.

1191
02:07:26,545 --> 02:07:26,866
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

1192
02:07:26,926 --> 02:07:27,366
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1193
02:07:28,326 --> 02:07:28,726
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1194
02:07:30,427 --> 02:07:32,167
[SPEAKER_21]: Podium name and address for the record, please.

1195
02:07:33,048 --> 02:07:33,788
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1196
02:07:35,117 --> 02:07:37,298
[SPEAKER_52]: Hi, my name's Jean Uzo, I live on Paris Street.

1197
02:07:37,398 --> 02:07:38,819
[SPEAKER_52]: I'll try to keep my comments brief.

1198
02:07:39,519 --> 02:07:55,388
[SPEAKER_52]: In this moment, there are many points I could make about the opioid crisis, the applicant, our floor treatment approaches, the challenges that those with addictions face daily and how they're intensified in the early stages of recovery, and how at risk these folks are from predatory bad actors.

1199
02:07:55,868 --> 02:08:00,791
[SPEAKER_52]: I could speak about Glenwood, its diversity, culture, socioeconomic, and otherwise.

1200
02:08:01,511 --> 02:08:10,554
[SPEAKER_52]: how negatively transformative this type of application could be to us, our elderly and at risk, our small businesses, and most importantly, our students.

1201
02:08:11,795 --> 02:08:16,937
[SPEAKER_52]: But I'd like to take a moment and celebrate the unity of our community that we have felt in this past week and a half.

1202
02:08:17,816 --> 02:08:24,379
[SPEAKER_52]: I've seen a coalescing in our Glenwood neighborhood and across the city that I haven't seen in a very long time.

1203
02:08:25,019 --> 02:08:38,045
[SPEAKER_52]: Regardless of station, cultural affiliation, or party if you have one, hundreds have stepped forward in support of Glenwood, in support of good treatment options, and changing the way we talk about those struggling with addiction and those seeking recovery.

1204
02:08:38,385 --> 02:08:43,147
[SPEAKER_52]: And most importantly, in support of working together for the benefit of the community at large.

1205
02:08:43,917 --> 02:08:55,030
[SPEAKER_52]: So, so far in the week we've collected about 550 signatures on our free petition and voter registration is working to diligently advise us as to how many of those are registered voters.

1206
02:08:56,374 --> 02:09:22,042
[SPEAKER_52]: The circulating petition is asking you all, elected and appointed officials, department heads, boards and commissions, and the administration, to join together with the community stakeholders and subject matter experts to have this very necessary hard conversation about this deeply important matter and codify a methadone zoning ordinance that will not leave location, proximity, operating requirements, and so much more to chance.

1207
02:09:22,882 --> 02:09:34,345
[SPEAKER_52]: and ordinance that will mitigate the guesswork of applicants, alleviate the level of stress that comes with uncertainty for residents, and assure that no other neighborhood has to go through what we are experiencing right now.

1208
02:09:35,085 --> 02:09:42,467
[SPEAKER_52]: As a community, and in our zoning laws for years, we've said we think it's important to outline our expectations around where and where not liquor could be sold.

1209
02:09:43,027 --> 02:09:44,168
[SPEAKER_52]: and more recently served.

1210
02:09:44,628 --> 02:09:51,153
[SPEAKER_52]: We've also determined that due to the complex requirements around cannabis, that they rise to the level of having their own ordinance.

1211
02:09:51,853 --> 02:10:03,522
[SPEAKER_52]: The signatories on the aforementioned petition, and perhaps others, believe that we should be just as purposeful with the controlled substance such as those that come with medically assisted treatment programs, a.k.a.

1212
02:10:03,922 --> 02:10:06,564
[SPEAKER_52]: methadone dispensaries or clinics if you so choose.

1213
02:10:06,744 --> 02:10:07,585
[SPEAKER_21]: You have 30 seconds.

1214
02:10:07,625 --> 02:10:08,085
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you.

1215
02:10:08,525 --> 02:10:15,990
[SPEAKER_52]: Our rights don't end where those who are suffering from addiction begin, and we can find the middle ground.

1216
02:10:16,351 --> 02:10:24,596
[SPEAKER_52]: I implore you, along with 550 of my fellow Medfordians who've signed, to please help us all do the work and get this on the books.

1217
02:10:25,017 --> 02:10:27,198
[SPEAKER_52]: I assure you our community will be better for it.

1218
02:10:27,578 --> 02:10:34,103
[SPEAKER_52]: And I just want to take a moment and thank you for the additional motivation you provided tonight in not allowing us to speak.

1219
02:10:34,523 --> 02:10:37,524
[SPEAKER_52]: You've really energized us and enlisted us even more.

1220
02:10:37,544 --> 02:10:38,825
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you.

1221
02:10:43,107 --> 02:10:50,971
[SPEAKER_21]: I would note, once again, a vote was taken, and per the council rules, once a vote is taken and disposed with, that concludes the discussion on the paper.

1222
02:10:51,031 --> 02:10:52,111
[SPEAKER_21]: So, thank you.

1223
02:10:52,611 --> 02:10:53,832
[SPEAKER_21]: Name and address for the record, please.

1224
02:10:54,552 --> 02:10:55,353
[SPEAKER_46]: JoAnne Deniso.

1225
02:10:55,393 --> 02:10:59,374
[SPEAKER_46]: I live on Otis Street for the past 50 or so years.

1226
02:11:00,255 --> 02:11:02,216
[SPEAKER_46]: I did want to say thank you.

1227
02:11:03,260 --> 02:11:07,862
[SPEAKER_46]: To the people that did notify us because it's a bottle listed on the list.

1228
02:11:07,923 --> 02:11:11,104
[SPEAKER_46]: I was not notified until after the community meeting the other day.

1229
02:11:11,144 --> 02:11:12,685
[SPEAKER_46]: That was the first letter that I had seen.

1230
02:11:12,705 --> 02:11:19,208
[SPEAKER_46]: I think that most of the speakers here have been very eloquent and, you know, talking about all the issues.

1231
02:11:19,329 --> 02:11:23,851
[SPEAKER_46]: I did also want to thank the one council that did come and want to hear from our neighborhood.

1232
02:11:24,506 --> 02:11:36,375
[SPEAKER_46]: And I agree wholeheartedly with Gene that the lack of transparency or even scarier, not knowing that this was going on in our community is something that we have definitely organized around.

1233
02:11:36,455 --> 02:11:44,040
[SPEAKER_46]: And I think it'll, you know, while this is the issue on the table today, I think that we have come together as a community.

1234
02:11:44,100 --> 02:11:48,083
[SPEAKER_46]: And I think that that's the positive that's come out of this the past few weeks.

1235
02:11:48,203 --> 02:11:48,563
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1236
02:11:48,763 --> 02:11:49,204
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1237
02:11:53,174 --> 02:11:54,155
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address for the record, please.

1238
02:11:54,175 --> 02:11:54,875
[SPEAKER_19]: You have three minutes.

1239
02:11:55,576 --> 02:11:56,457
[SPEAKER_43]: My name is John Flagg.

1240
02:11:56,777 --> 02:11:57,998
[SPEAKER_43]: I reside at Garfield Ave.

1241
02:11:58,818 --> 02:12:01,040
[SPEAKER_43]: With them, we're withdrawing the petition.

1242
02:12:01,060 --> 02:12:06,725
[SPEAKER_43]: I kind of screwed up my speech here, so let me see what I can come up with.

1243
02:12:06,745 --> 02:12:13,550
[SPEAKER_43]: A for-profit methadone dispensary should be situated in the commercial and industrial district.

1244
02:12:13,710 --> 02:12:22,277
[SPEAKER_43]: While mass laws have been favorable to requiring municipalities to allow access to these facilities, a for-profit dispensary

1245
02:12:23,752 --> 02:12:33,579
[SPEAKER_43]: without other modes of treatment, such as individual group or family counseling, and only hands out doses at the location does not meet the requirements set by the state.

1246
02:12:34,419 --> 02:12:42,485
[SPEAKER_43]: They can't and won't offer hepatitis, HIV and AIDS education, counseling and support, nor will health education services be presented.

1247
02:12:43,065 --> 02:12:45,527
[SPEAKER_43]: This is a for profit dosing location.

1248
02:12:48,148 --> 02:12:53,612
[SPEAKER_43]: I find it quite a coincidence that the stop the stigma resolution was introduced last Tuesday.

1249
02:12:55,543 --> 02:13:02,647
[SPEAKER_43]: I take great offense to the old political trick of making the opposing group look evil for not supporting victims of addiction.

1250
02:13:03,447 --> 02:13:05,288
[SPEAKER_43]: My family has been hit by addiction.

1251
02:13:05,448 --> 02:13:07,990
[SPEAKER_43]: I've lost family and close friends to addiction.

1252
02:13:08,430 --> 02:13:11,912
[SPEAKER_43]: I currently have a family member living addiction, living on the streets.

1253
02:13:14,113 --> 02:13:17,055
[SPEAKER_43]: I dread getting the phone call that he has lost his battle.

1254
02:13:18,587 --> 02:13:27,995
[SPEAKER_43]: I support recovery, the right recovery, not some huge profit corporation inserting itself into a community, not to help people, but to make more money.

1255
02:13:29,977 --> 02:13:32,479
[SPEAKER_43]: Acadia Healthcare operates 253 treatment facilities across 38 states.

1256
02:13:32,499 --> 02:13:34,241
[SPEAKER_43]: Annual revenue for 2023 was 2.9 billion, a 12% increase from 22.

1257
02:13:43,544 --> 02:13:46,406
[SPEAKER_43]: This is not an altruistic entity looking to help people.

1258
02:13:46,867 --> 02:13:54,673
[SPEAKER_43]: This is a huge corporation inserting itself into a diverse community without regard to consequences, just to make more profit for the corporation.

1259
02:13:56,411 --> 02:14:00,573
[SPEAKER_43]: Habit Opco has 10 facilities from Yarmouth to Manchester, New Hampshire.

1260
02:14:01,013 --> 02:14:04,715
[SPEAKER_43]: Each and every one of those locations are situated in the commercial industrial area.

1261
02:14:05,375 --> 02:14:10,417
[SPEAKER_43]: Best I can tell, all the locations offer some type of therapy or counseling with doctors on site.

1262
02:14:11,097 --> 02:14:22,803
[SPEAKER_43]: Why would anyone think a storefront dosing center should be located in a thickly settled residential area with elderly families and children's facilities present is questionable at the very least.

1263
02:14:24,703 --> 02:14:25,624
[SPEAKER_21]: You have about 30 seconds.

1264
02:14:30,782 --> 02:14:33,764
[SPEAKER_43]: We've all heard how the council has no jurisdiction on this matter.

1265
02:14:34,264 --> 02:14:36,866
[SPEAKER_43]: This is a gap in our zoning ordinances.

1266
02:14:37,607 --> 02:14:45,172
[SPEAKER_43]: Local government is supposed to protect its citizens, not create circumstances that will make another set of victims.

1267
02:14:46,293 --> 02:14:47,133
[SPEAKER_43]: And shame on you.

1268
02:14:47,594 --> 02:14:52,377
[SPEAKER_43]: Parliamentary rules have always been, when a motion is put in, there's public comment.

1269
02:14:52,577 --> 02:14:53,478
[SPEAKER_43]: You shut us down.

1270
02:14:53,738 --> 02:14:54,198
[SPEAKER_43]: Shame on you.

1271
02:14:54,719 --> 02:14:55,839
[SPEAKER_21]: I was following the votes.

1272
02:14:55,899 --> 02:14:56,240
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1273
02:15:02,054 --> 02:15:03,855
[SPEAKER_21]: refer you to the council rules once again.

1274
02:15:04,435 --> 02:15:05,775
[SPEAKER_21]: Name and address for the record, please.

1275
02:15:05,815 --> 02:15:07,656
[SPEAKER_33]: Marian Tomaszczuk of Garfield Avenue.

1276
02:15:07,676 --> 02:15:08,496
[SPEAKER_21]: You have three minutes.

1277
02:15:09,737 --> 02:15:19,660
[SPEAKER_33]: A clinic is a healthcare center where you receive routine preventative care when you are healthy or visit your doctor when you are sick.

1278
02:15:21,941 --> 02:15:27,403
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm highly insulted that you keep saying that this is a clinic, a medical clinic.

1279
02:15:28,283 --> 02:15:29,483
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't said that once, thank you.

1280
02:15:29,524 --> 02:15:30,804
[SPEAKER_33]: No, well, it's listed

1281
02:15:31,354 --> 02:15:41,660
[SPEAKER_33]: as a medical clinic and Alicia Hunt has said repeatedly that it's a medical clinic, that's when I got upset and you called the recess.

1282
02:15:42,801 --> 02:15:46,263
[SPEAKER_33]: So, and you mentioned that it needs a special permit.

1283
02:15:47,304 --> 02:15:57,750
[SPEAKER_33]: That's why, as people have said, that tomorrow they can go back and say, I wanna reapply and get a special permit.

1284
02:15:58,362 --> 02:16:18,109
[SPEAKER_33]: and forego the zoning laws that should apply as they do to pot dispensaries and be in a residential area, near the schools, near the three parks, near the dancing school, near the daycares, near residential areas.

1285
02:16:19,009 --> 02:16:25,431
[SPEAKER_33]: And they can just stay in our neighborhood in the same place or go two blocks over or to go

1286
02:16:25,993 --> 02:16:42,666
[SPEAKER_33]: in your neighborhood or your neighborhood or your neighborhood or anybody else's neighborhood where the residents are residing and they don't belong in residential neighborhoods because a dosing center is not a medical clinic.

1287
02:16:43,446 --> 02:16:48,150
[SPEAKER_33]: It is a center where you get a dose of medication.

1288
02:16:48,650 --> 02:16:51,312
[SPEAKER_33]: Your visit is two to five minutes.

1289
02:16:51,813 --> 02:16:54,595
[SPEAKER_33]: You come in, you get your dose and you leave.

1290
02:16:55,367 --> 02:16:58,168
[SPEAKER_33]: That's the same definition on Google.

1291
02:16:58,368 --> 02:17:01,229
[SPEAKER_33]: It is not the definition of a medical clinic.

1292
02:17:01,709 --> 02:17:05,091
[SPEAKER_33]: They should not be allowed to get a special permit.

1293
02:17:05,531 --> 02:17:11,613
[SPEAKER_33]: They should have to have a zoning law of a marijuana facility.

1294
02:17:12,154 --> 02:17:12,574
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1295
02:17:12,974 --> 02:17:13,314
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1296
02:17:18,803 --> 02:17:19,463
[SPEAKER_15]: You have three minutes.

1297
02:17:19,644 --> 02:17:20,984
[SPEAKER_31]: I won't need three minutes, thank you.

1298
02:17:21,005 --> 02:17:25,307
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi, my name is Paulette Vardabedian, 27 Central Avenue, Medford, Mass.

1299
02:17:26,788 --> 02:17:30,171
[SPEAKER_31]: Just wanna let you know that I have a lot invested in Medford.

1300
02:17:30,551 --> 02:17:33,653
[SPEAKER_31]: I've lived at my current address for 70 years.

1301
02:17:34,213 --> 02:17:38,836
[SPEAKER_31]: My family has lived in Medford at my house and the house next door since 1923.

1302
02:17:40,297 --> 02:17:44,640
[SPEAKER_31]: I remember when the rag man used to come around with his donkey.

1303
02:17:44,660 --> 02:17:46,261
[SPEAKER_31]: I remember when the,

1304
02:17:47,382 --> 02:17:55,850
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, knife sharpening man came along with his horse, and my grandmother would run out to get the stuff for her garden.

1305
02:17:56,510 --> 02:17:59,132
[SPEAKER_31]: So I remember before 93 was built.

1306
02:17:59,433 --> 02:18:01,374
[SPEAKER_31]: So what I'm saying is, I'm old.

1307
02:18:02,035 --> 02:18:03,416
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm a senior citizen.

1308
02:18:03,997 --> 02:18:09,702
[SPEAKER_31]: I am also a call it a group that is protected.

1309
02:18:10,856 --> 02:18:20,204
[SPEAKER_31]: And to have this type of neighborhood and this type of facility in a neighborhood where I would feel endangered is infringing on my senior rights.

1310
02:18:21,304 --> 02:18:26,609
[SPEAKER_31]: The other thing is that, oh my God, my brain.

1311
02:18:27,990 --> 02:18:28,650
[SPEAKER_31]: Let me think.

1312
02:18:29,431 --> 02:18:36,577
[SPEAKER_31]: That what one of the other speakers spoke about as the last meeting to have that

1313
02:18:37,644 --> 02:18:41,147
[SPEAKER_31]: special to stigmatize things.

1314
02:18:42,788 --> 02:18:50,994
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm feeling stigmatized by not being protected by having these type of businesses in a, again, residential area.

1315
02:18:51,635 --> 02:19:01,402
[SPEAKER_31]: The other thing is that, I'm sorry, my neighbor left during the recess, but she had made a wonderful graph of Medford that spoke about three different things.

1316
02:19:02,122 --> 02:19:04,104
[SPEAKER_31]: One, the median income

1317
02:19:04,801 --> 02:19:09,703
[SPEAKER_31]: of Medford communities, South Medford, West Medford, North Medford, Glenwood.

1318
02:19:10,843 --> 02:19:19,466
[SPEAKER_31]: And Glenwood is the lowest income, lowest medium income of all of Medford.

1319
02:19:19,986 --> 02:19:25,127
[SPEAKER_31]: Glenwood is also the place where there is the most stay-at-home mothers.

1320
02:19:25,648 --> 02:19:29,609
[SPEAKER_31]: Glenwood is also the place where there are the most children.

1321
02:19:32,566 --> 02:19:34,007
[SPEAKER_31]: Why are we being picked on?

1322
02:19:34,047 --> 02:19:37,991
[SPEAKER_31]: Where these type of companies always look for the low income neighborhoods to go.

1323
02:19:38,391 --> 02:19:45,677
[SPEAKER_31]: So are we being picked out as the lowest part of Medford to have this facility?

1324
02:19:45,898 --> 02:19:46,558
[SPEAKER_31]: That's wrong.

1325
02:19:47,999 --> 02:19:51,442
[SPEAKER_31]: And that's the only thing I want to say is- About 30 seconds.

1326
02:19:51,482 --> 02:19:51,723
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

1327
02:19:51,823 --> 02:20:00,210
[SPEAKER_31]: The other thing I feel very, very telling that Emily Lazzaro, this is her special project is on- Please direct your comments to the chair.

1328
02:20:00,874 --> 02:20:06,178
[SPEAKER_31]: is gone, that she is not here to hear debate.

1329
02:20:06,558 --> 02:20:08,400
[SPEAKER_31]: It's very, very wrong and telling.

1330
02:20:08,580 --> 02:20:08,920
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1331
02:20:31,510 --> 02:20:32,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's what you need.

1332
02:20:32,891 --> 02:20:34,011
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to get you through the day.

1333
02:20:35,211 --> 02:20:36,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Not a facility we need in Medford.

1334
02:20:37,332 --> 02:20:38,993
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish somebody would show leadership here.

1335
02:20:40,173 --> 02:20:51,838
[SPEAKER_14]: All I hear tonight is how these people have a right to apply for this type of permit, and we're worried about a civil rights violation of somebody if we don't allow this facility in the city of Medford.

1336
02:20:52,378 --> 02:20:54,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Mike McGlynn showed leadership years and years ago.

1337
02:20:55,819 --> 02:20:57,780
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a methadone clinic that was supposed to come here.

1338
02:20:58,960 --> 02:20:59,841
[SPEAKER_14]: All of a sudden, they were gone.

1339
02:21:00,081 --> 02:21:00,741
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a leader.

1340
02:21:02,128 --> 02:21:05,292
[SPEAKER_14]: that made it go away and represented the will of the people.

1341
02:21:06,534 --> 02:21:07,375
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to see it again.

1342
02:21:07,415 --> 02:21:08,536
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't heard it up till now.

1343
02:21:09,377 --> 02:21:12,021
[SPEAKER_14]: The other thing is the civil rights violation.

1344
02:21:12,161 --> 02:21:15,305
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm quite sure they don't have one of these facilities in Winchester.

1345
02:21:16,106 --> 02:21:20,451
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm quite sure that they don't, they're not worried about a civil rights violation.

1346
02:21:21,377 --> 02:21:26,998
[SPEAKER_14]: And correct me if I'm wrong, it seems like the majority of the council is in favor of this type of facility.

1347
02:21:27,738 --> 02:21:28,979
[SPEAKER_14]: I would hope that they wouldn't be.

1348
02:21:29,679 --> 02:21:32,419
[SPEAKER_14]: There's also a nursery school within a block of this location.

1349
02:21:33,239 --> 02:21:35,900
[SPEAKER_14]: This facility has no need in Medford.

1350
02:21:36,100 --> 02:21:39,120
[SPEAKER_14]: There are other facilities just like it within a mile.

1351
02:21:40,081 --> 02:21:44,622
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't wean people off the drugs at a methadone clinic.

1352
02:21:45,322 --> 02:21:46,562
[SPEAKER_14]: They give them whatever they need,

1353
02:21:48,007 --> 02:21:50,608
[SPEAKER_14]: as a legal method, and it's just to make money.

1354
02:21:51,528 --> 02:21:52,489
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't need this here.

1355
02:21:52,529 --> 02:21:56,510
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to see some leadership from our elected officials, the ZBA, the city council.

1356
02:21:56,550 --> 02:21:57,930
[SPEAKER_14]: They work for the citizenry method.

1357
02:21:58,571 --> 02:22:04,993
[SPEAKER_14]: If the ZBA can't figure out a way to keep them out, maybe we need to think creatively and think outside the box.

1358
02:22:05,493 --> 02:22:09,574
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm pretty sure that everybody here in the chamber is against this type of facility.

1359
02:22:10,395 --> 02:22:13,176
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'd like to see our elected officials share

1360
02:22:14,016 --> 02:22:14,557
[SPEAKER_14]: that opinion.

1361
02:22:14,837 --> 02:22:15,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1362
02:22:15,658 --> 02:22:19,922
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Jones, I would just note, Mr. Jones, the application was withdrawn.

1363
02:22:20,723 --> 02:22:21,263
[SPEAKER_21]: I understand.

1364
02:22:21,363 --> 02:22:23,305
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm just going to speak now.

1365
02:22:23,325 --> 02:22:23,786
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1366
02:22:24,186 --> 02:22:25,567
[SPEAKER_21]: So the application was withdrawn.

1367
02:22:26,708 --> 02:22:28,770
[SPEAKER_21]: The council's not the special permit granting authority.

1368
02:22:29,531 --> 02:22:36,814
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not our role under the state chapter 40 a zoning law for us to insert ourselves in the special permit process of another special permit granting authority.

1369
02:22:37,235 --> 02:22:44,318
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think you heard from all of the city staff involved from many counselors that we wanted and from the proponent from everyone here.

1370
02:22:46,188 --> 02:22:47,269
[SPEAKER_21]: And people have emailed me.

1371
02:22:47,549 --> 02:22:50,292
[SPEAKER_21]: If you got an email back from me, I think you'll know what I said in the email back.

1372
02:22:51,372 --> 02:22:55,075
[SPEAKER_21]: I said, I don't think this is the right place, and I don't think this is the right process.

1373
02:22:55,295 --> 02:22:58,438
[SPEAKER_21]: The right location, or the right place as being in Medford?

1374
02:22:58,878 --> 02:22:59,819
[SPEAKER_21]: The right location.

1375
02:23:00,379 --> 02:23:01,580
[SPEAKER_21]: Most of the responses have said,

1376
02:23:02,541 --> 02:23:05,363
[SPEAKER_21]: We believe that this has a place in the spectrum of treatment.

1377
02:23:05,904 --> 02:23:07,965
[SPEAKER_21]: We'd like to see it in a commercial industrial district.

1378
02:23:08,586 --> 02:23:24,078
[SPEAKER_21]: I think you would find that basically everyone who acted and was involved in this process from the city side, whether that's the planning office, representatives from the health department, members of the city council, we worked to play our role as best as we could to have the public comment heard.

1379
02:23:24,398 --> 02:23:27,921
[SPEAKER_21]: And the result was that the applicant said, we heard this isn't gonna work here.

1380
02:23:29,096 --> 02:23:29,977
[SPEAKER_21]: and we're withdrawing.

1381
02:23:30,377 --> 02:23:39,343
[SPEAKER_21]: So the result is it's not coming, the application is not applied, and now we wanna come and work with all parties involved to put this in a place where people feel comfortable that it should be here.

1382
02:23:40,103 --> 02:23:46,368
[SPEAKER_21]: So that was what happened, that was the result, and I think that's being lost a little bit in this discussion.

1383
02:23:46,388 --> 02:23:50,630
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just wanted to state that when we talk about what roles different people played in the process here.

1384
02:23:50,690 --> 02:23:53,452
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand the procedural elements that you just spoke about.

1385
02:23:53,813 --> 02:23:54,773
[SPEAKER_14]: It's over for tonight.

1386
02:23:55,634 --> 02:23:56,334
[SPEAKER_14]: It will be back.

1387
02:23:56,855 --> 02:23:58,496
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to see us together

1388
02:23:59,896 --> 02:24:00,797
[SPEAKER_14]: get what the city wants.

1389
02:24:00,837 --> 02:24:02,338
[SPEAKER_14]: This is straight up a replacement.

1390
02:24:02,518 --> 02:24:03,498
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not treatment.

1391
02:24:03,838 --> 02:24:05,299
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not gonna help them get better.

1392
02:24:05,779 --> 02:24:08,601
[SPEAKER_14]: It's giving a replacement for the drugs that they are seeking.

1393
02:24:08,641 --> 02:24:13,043
[SPEAKER_14]: It's gonna be a magnet for all these type of individuals that are sick, they need treatment.

1394
02:24:13,743 --> 02:24:16,325
[SPEAKER_14]: They just don't need a handout of the drugs that they're looking for.

1395
02:24:16,605 --> 02:24:20,427
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'd love to work together on this to keep this facility out of the city.

1396
02:24:21,587 --> 02:24:21,867
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1397
02:24:21,947 --> 02:24:22,448
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1398
02:24:22,468 --> 02:24:25,849
[SPEAKER_22]: Name and address for the record, please.

1399
02:24:25,869 --> 02:24:26,730
[SPEAKER_22]: You have three minutes.

1400
02:24:27,589 --> 02:24:29,611
[SPEAKER_47]: Diana Santiago, 19 Paris Street.

1401
02:24:29,631 --> 02:24:37,136
[SPEAKER_47]: I just wanted to let you guys know that I did get some text messages tonight from people who wanted to join on Zoom and they were unable to do so.

1402
02:24:37,776 --> 02:24:40,938
[SPEAKER_47]: So you do have other residents out there who are trying to get access.

1403
02:24:42,039 --> 02:24:44,281
[SPEAKER_47]: I am one of the butters on 19 Paris Street.

1404
02:24:44,721 --> 02:24:47,623
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm also one of my past jobs was a social worker.

1405
02:24:47,663 --> 02:24:49,564
[SPEAKER_47]: So I do understand the need for the treatment.

1406
02:24:49,624 --> 02:24:53,087
[SPEAKER_47]: Again, I think we've talked a lot about the right location, et cetera.

1407
02:24:53,667 --> 02:25:08,175
[SPEAKER_47]: I think there's an opportunity here, and I will admit my understanding of all the offices may not be as clear as others, but it sounds like it might be some hard work, but some worthwhile work to try to figure out how to tighten our zoning.

1408
02:25:08,356 --> 02:25:19,262
[SPEAKER_47]: I know out in Springfield, the quote from their director of their housing board was that they felt that the application of HOPCO out there came in under the radar.

1409
02:25:20,302 --> 02:25:21,743
[SPEAKER_47]: there was not a lot of information.

1410
02:25:21,903 --> 02:25:26,766
[SPEAKER_47]: As the person who never got the postcard from that, there was not a lot of information.

1411
02:25:26,786 --> 02:25:43,356
[SPEAKER_47]: I think there's an opportunity to see that maybe we need to be collecting more information as a city for when people are petitioning to bring businesses in, and I mean all businesses, so that you can really get a good, firm idea of what's coming in and where it is and is it in the appropriate zoning.

1412
02:25:47,375 --> 02:25:50,997
[SPEAKER_47]: It's an opportunity to come together and really tighten up everything, I think.

1413
02:25:53,759 --> 02:25:57,361
[SPEAKER_47]: So hopefully you guys will not shy away from that.

1414
02:25:57,381 --> 02:26:00,342
[SPEAKER_47]: I did want to comment also on tonight's meeting.

1415
02:26:00,442 --> 02:26:00,822
[SPEAKER_47]: I know you

1416
02:26:02,694 --> 02:26:06,215
[SPEAKER_47]: we went on and we didn't get a chance to speak and you were following the rules.

1417
02:26:06,335 --> 02:26:10,937
[SPEAKER_47]: As someone who hasn't attended this regularly, I was sitting back there and I couldn't understand what was happening.

1418
02:26:10,957 --> 02:26:13,798
[SPEAKER_47]: It was like you just skipped over it and it was like a slap in the face.

1419
02:26:14,198 --> 02:26:16,279
[SPEAKER_47]: Then, sir, you did explain it and thank you for explaining.

1420
02:26:16,299 --> 02:26:26,863
[SPEAKER_47]: I understand now that it was not a slap in my face, that there were certain rules, but I think it would have been helpful if you explained what those rules are for some of us newbies who didn't understand what was going on.

1421
02:26:26,883 --> 02:26:29,424
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, I appreciate the comment.

1422
02:26:36,104 --> 02:26:38,285
[SPEAKER_20]: Name and address for the record, please.

1423
02:26:38,485 --> 02:26:40,266
[SPEAKER_05]: You have three minutes.

1424
02:26:40,586 --> 02:26:42,207
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I apologize for getting here late.

1425
02:26:42,247 --> 02:26:43,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I was at softball.

1426
02:26:43,648 --> 02:26:51,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't gonna come because I knew it got withdrawn, but as I'm sitting home watching the Zoom meeting, I'm absolutely infuriated for a couple of reasons.

1427
02:26:52,013 --> 02:26:57,676
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, we do know that they can withdraw it, which I'm happy that they withdrew it, especially from the area that it was put in.

1428
02:26:58,516 --> 02:27:00,578
[SPEAKER_05]: As we all know, I am very vocal about addiction.

1429
02:27:00,678 --> 02:27:03,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I am one of those junkie addicts who was on methadone for two years.

1430
02:27:03,980 --> 02:27:09,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I got off successfully and have remained clean and sober for 19 years of sobriety with nothing in my bag.

1431
02:27:10,282 --> 02:27:12,284
[SPEAKER_05]: So it does work.

1432
02:27:12,985 --> 02:27:14,526
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a handout.

1433
02:27:14,606 --> 02:27:16,027
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know we didn't mean anything by it.

1434
02:27:16,068 --> 02:27:17,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love the person who was just speaking.

1435
02:27:18,069 --> 02:27:25,456
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is the reason why I was embarrassed to tell people I was on methadone for those two years at first, because people don't understand methadone.

1436
02:27:25,696 --> 02:27:26,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1437
02:27:26,377 --> 02:27:29,000
[SPEAKER_05]: But places like have it off though, are a disgrace.

1438
02:27:29,620 --> 02:27:31,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and I'm going to tell you that right now.

1439
02:27:31,241 --> 02:27:33,882
[SPEAKER_05]: That is not the facility that we would want in Medford.

1440
02:27:34,262 --> 02:27:35,182
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to tell you why.

1441
02:27:35,482 --> 02:27:37,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Kappadoko also care about his numbers.

1442
02:27:37,383 --> 02:27:40,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I go down Massacasse Boulevard, that lady who spoke completely lied.

1443
02:27:41,045 --> 02:27:42,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm down there talking with those addicts.

1444
02:27:42,485 --> 02:27:46,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Those addicts, half of them are still my friends, because I will never turn my back on an addict out there still suffering.

1445
02:27:47,087 --> 02:27:48,188
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not above anybody.

1446
02:27:48,388 --> 02:27:49,508
[SPEAKER_05]: None of us are in this world.

1447
02:27:50,428 --> 02:27:51,569
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said.

1448
02:27:54,304 --> 02:27:57,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I take pitches weekly because I go down there three times a week.

1449
02:27:57,145 --> 02:27:58,806
[SPEAKER_05]: My daughter, as we know, is softball.

1450
02:27:58,986 --> 02:28:01,507
[SPEAKER_05]: She goes to a program that's two blocks away from that.

1451
02:28:01,927 --> 02:28:03,268
[SPEAKER_05]: They're calling it a dispensary.

1452
02:28:03,568 --> 02:28:04,648
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a dosing window.

1453
02:28:05,208 --> 02:28:05,869
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.

1454
02:28:06,369 --> 02:28:08,850
[SPEAKER_05]: And what a dosing window is, someone's going to go in there.

1455
02:28:08,870 --> 02:28:11,111
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're too high, they're going to get refused their medication.

1456
02:28:11,131 --> 02:28:11,771
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going to happen?

1457
02:28:11,791 --> 02:28:12,651
[SPEAKER_05]: A fight's going to break out.

1458
02:28:12,931 --> 02:28:15,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you want to admit the police department is going to have to step involved.

1459
02:28:15,452 --> 02:28:16,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Mind you, they got no contract.

1460
02:28:17,213 --> 02:28:22,820
[SPEAKER_05]: The funding, I don't care how much money they're going to offer the city, no amount of money is going to be worth what it's going to do to this community.

1461
02:28:23,260 --> 02:28:29,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, you want to put it somewhere, put it at LMH and make sure it's a program like a Bayquote or a Cambridge Health Alliance facility.

1462
02:28:30,069 --> 02:28:35,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Somewhere that has a good reputation, a good background, and actually is there with people to get treatment.

1463
02:28:35,515 --> 02:28:37,776
[SPEAKER_05]: All they're doing is they're dosing and sending them out their way.

1464
02:28:37,836 --> 02:28:38,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Dosing and sending them out their way.

1465
02:28:38,996 --> 02:28:40,977
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, they are coughing dope down the street.

1466
02:28:41,317 --> 02:28:42,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they are sticking needles.

1467
02:28:42,377 --> 02:28:43,618
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to find needles everywhere.

1468
02:28:44,218 --> 02:28:45,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sorry, I will never be okay with that.

1469
02:28:46,018 --> 02:28:54,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Because what I will do as the person that I am, and I will stand in front of you, whoever approves this, I will take all of that garbage and all those tents and I will throw them on their front lawn.

1470
02:28:55,321 --> 02:28:58,002
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can promise you that, because it's unacceptable.

1471
02:28:58,402 --> 02:29:00,703
[SPEAKER_05]: We are the taxpayers in this city, and we should be heard.

1472
02:29:01,103 --> 02:29:06,125
[SPEAKER_05]: And when something is so outrageous, as some people say, oh, it's a wonderful idea.

1473
02:29:06,165 --> 02:29:11,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Those people who are speaking who have degrees, I really don't care, because their opinion means nothing to me.

1474
02:29:11,288 --> 02:29:12,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to talk to them for 30 seconds.

1475
02:29:12,688 --> 02:29:13,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's fine.

1476
02:29:14,249 --> 02:29:15,689
[SPEAKER_05]: My 30 seconds count too, Zach.

1477
02:29:15,709 --> 02:29:16,790
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

1478
02:29:16,890 --> 02:29:17,250
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1479
02:29:17,330 --> 02:29:18,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to let you know.

1480
02:29:18,291 --> 02:29:19,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to let you know.

1481
02:29:19,631 --> 02:29:20,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1482
02:29:20,852 --> 02:29:23,493
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just something that I sit here, and I listen to people who have, like,

1483
02:29:24,471 --> 02:29:27,032
[SPEAKER_05]: counseling degrees, and this degree, I have a counseling degree too.

1484
02:29:27,412 --> 02:29:35,794
[SPEAKER_05]: But unless you've walked in the shoes of an addict and you've been there doing outreach on a daily basis, you have no idea what it entails for the city and it'll be a dumpster fire.

1485
02:29:35,854 --> 02:29:37,174
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's all I'm gonna say.

1486
02:29:37,694 --> 02:29:38,294
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Carrie.

1487
02:29:45,776 --> 02:29:47,337
[SPEAKER_22]: Any further public comment on the matter?

1488
02:29:48,877 --> 02:29:52,598
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing no hands on Zoom and no one at the line in the chambers of the podium,

1489
02:29:56,902 --> 02:30:01,972
[SPEAKER_21]: It's public participation so can make motions.

1490
02:30:01,992 --> 02:30:02,733
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, if you want to.

1491
02:30:04,219 --> 02:30:12,366
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to bolster, you know, you had mentioned that I think it's really important to say that we shouldn't mistake caution for support.

1492
02:30:12,587 --> 02:30:25,718
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I think a number of us on the city council have been really cautious with what we've said in the last two weeks because of what our legal counsel and because what our policy experts have advised us to be careful to say in a public forum.

1493
02:30:25,779 --> 02:30:27,880
[SPEAKER_18]: But I have, you know, encouraged folks to,

1494
02:30:28,939 --> 02:30:38,368
[SPEAKER_18]: make phone calls to me to discuss this issue, because I think that you'd be surprised to find that I see this issue very similarly as a lot of you all.

1495
02:30:39,289 --> 02:30:45,615
[SPEAKER_18]: I came in planning to support, and I did, you know, by a 6-1 vote, we did pass Councilor Scarpelli's resolution.

1496
02:30:47,497 --> 02:31:01,817
[SPEAKER_18]: I agree with Councilor Berrios' comment that this wasn't the best location for this project and it wasn't the best process for the project, and I appreciate that Councilor Scarpelli put forward a resolution to help us reform the process.

1497
02:31:03,479 --> 02:31:10,241
[SPEAKER_18]: There's been a lot said about the notifications and the transparency and the outreach of the process.

1498
02:31:11,101 --> 02:31:25,524
[SPEAKER_18]: I spent hours on phone calls last week with city staff, including with the director of planning, who promised soon a better outreach and transparency process, particularly involving the city council, so we can help get out the word better too.

1499
02:31:27,064 --> 02:31:39,951
[SPEAKER_18]: Something that we are meeting tomorrow night in resident services, the resident services committee is creating a user guide for city council to make our rules clearer and more accessible, especially if this is your first time coming to a city council meeting.

1500
02:31:40,451 --> 02:31:45,034
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are just some points I wanted to bring up just to clarify and to bolster.

1501
02:31:45,314 --> 02:31:45,634
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1502
02:31:48,555 --> 02:31:50,216
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record please, you have three minutes.

1503
02:31:51,097 --> 02:31:53,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Excuse me, my name is Anthony D'Antonio.

1504
02:31:54,568 --> 02:31:58,190
[SPEAKER_12]: currently at 24 Hicks Avenue in Medford.

1505
02:31:59,290 --> 02:32:01,291
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that this issue hits home with a lot of people.

1506
02:32:01,331 --> 02:32:08,895
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that if I was to ask people in this audience who has not been affected by drug use, addiction, whatnot, it wouldn't seem any hands up.

1507
02:32:09,095 --> 02:32:12,616
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm talking about cousins, uncles, aunts, mothers, fathers.

1508
02:32:13,697 --> 02:32:19,640
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's good to try to get a fix on this thing, but the problem is,

1509
02:32:20,862 --> 02:32:26,823
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not gonna do anything until you realize that this is, like Mr. Jones said, this is all about money.

1510
02:32:27,963 --> 02:32:45,367
[SPEAKER_12]: You ever wonder why they can take Norfolk facility and put together 400 families down there of people just recently in this country, but yet people in this country who are addicted, if you haven't got the $50,000, you're not gonna get your time in a facility to try to break you from this evilness, okay?

1511
02:32:46,027 --> 02:32:47,227
[SPEAKER_12]: And the government is at fault.

1512
02:32:47,547 --> 02:32:49,448
[SPEAKER_12]: You wanna fix this problem for starters?

1513
02:32:50,384 --> 02:32:58,752
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, you had governors in the state, opened up the doors and institutions that housed a lot of people that were ill, mentally ill.

1514
02:33:00,046 --> 02:33:01,207
[SPEAKER_12]: Drugs, you name it.

1515
02:33:01,287 --> 02:33:02,108
[SPEAKER_12]: The gamut was there.

1516
02:33:02,388 --> 02:33:03,148
[SPEAKER_12]: They opened the doors.

1517
02:33:03,889 --> 02:33:06,151
[SPEAKER_12]: The last 25 years, you're walking out on the street.

1518
02:33:06,431 --> 02:33:07,192
[SPEAKER_12]: Where are they going to go?

1519
02:33:07,252 --> 02:33:07,992
[SPEAKER_12]: Guess where they wound up?

1520
02:33:08,132 --> 02:33:10,954
[SPEAKER_12]: They wound up in Casa Nelliot and different places like that.

1521
02:33:12,175 --> 02:33:12,816
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a shame.

1522
02:33:13,316 --> 02:33:18,320
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at the, you have a Long Island facility there that could house over a thousand people there.

1523
02:33:18,700 --> 02:33:20,021
[SPEAKER_12]: So the bridge is gone.

1524
02:33:21,002 --> 02:33:24,163
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the fact that it's gone, and now they're having an argument.

1525
02:33:24,203 --> 02:33:25,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Quincy's having an argument with the city of Boston.

1526
02:33:25,843 --> 02:33:28,563
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't want to put a bridge up there, but they have a facility there.

1527
02:33:28,783 --> 02:33:34,344
[SPEAKER_12]: The people need to be supported by the government, who are the ones who are causing the problem.

1528
02:33:34,844 --> 02:33:38,705
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to stop this problem, start executing the dealers, okay?

1529
02:33:39,005 --> 02:33:39,645
[SPEAKER_12]: Get rid of them.

1530
02:33:40,105 --> 02:33:43,886
[SPEAKER_12]: They're nothing but scum on the Earth, and it's affecting everybody.

1531
02:33:44,506 --> 02:33:49,027
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody in, I guarantee you, anybody in this facility here has a,

1532
02:33:50,347 --> 02:33:54,430
[SPEAKER_12]: probably has somebody they're very close to, but you're not gonna do it because it's all about the buck.

1533
02:33:55,050 --> 02:33:56,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Ronald Reagan said the right thing.

1534
02:33:58,172 --> 02:34:00,394
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here from the government, I'm here to help you.

1535
02:34:01,334 --> 02:34:02,915
[SPEAKER_12]: Scariest words in the world, trust me.

1536
02:34:03,255 --> 02:34:04,536
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not doing us any favors.

1537
02:34:05,197 --> 02:34:13,082
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know your intentions are great, that's fine, but the problem, you know, it's like a tap, a water faucet, you can't shut it off because the wash is broken.

1538
02:34:13,102 --> 02:34:16,864
[SPEAKER_12]: You gotta take it from where it is, from the bootstraps, my friend.

1539
02:34:17,244 --> 02:34:18,025
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, thank you.

1540
02:34:20,998 --> 02:34:23,460
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to address the record, please, in three minutes.

1541
02:34:23,480 --> 02:34:25,421
[SPEAKER_44]: Steve Self, 106 Damon Road.

1542
02:34:26,582 --> 02:34:40,033
[SPEAKER_44]: First of all, I just wanted to say it's a little offensive to me that, number one, that one of the counselors isn't here tonight, didn't show up, is on Zoom, and that one of the other ones stormed out Matt.

1543
02:34:40,053 --> 02:34:42,435
[SPEAKER_40]: Please direct your comments to the chair.

1544
02:34:43,335 --> 02:34:45,316
[SPEAKER_44]: I find that to be very unprofessional.

1545
02:34:45,336 --> 02:34:55,719
[SPEAKER_44]: What I would say to the counselors is that, what I would say to the counselors is, if you can't do the job, you should resign, and we can put someone in the role.

1546
02:34:56,099 --> 02:34:58,820
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I'm still on my three minutes.

1547
02:34:58,840 --> 02:35:00,520
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I'm still on the three minutes.

1548
02:35:00,920 --> 02:35:03,141
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, Zach, I'm still on my three minutes.

1549
02:35:03,161 --> 02:35:04,602
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, you can be done now.

1550
02:35:04,702 --> 02:35:05,882
[SPEAKER_22]: You can be done here.

1551
02:35:05,982 --> 02:35:06,762
[SPEAKER_07]: You can be done here.

1552
02:35:13,206 --> 02:35:15,047
[SPEAKER_21]: You have no clue why this person isn't here.

1553
02:35:15,827 --> 02:35:18,988
[SPEAKER_22]: You have no idea what, Steve, can we have a conversation?

1554
02:35:19,988 --> 02:35:21,549
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, can you stop interrupting me?

1555
02:35:21,969 --> 02:35:22,929
[SPEAKER_21]: Please stop interrupting me.

1556
02:35:23,950 --> 02:35:33,553
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to note to you that you have no idea why this counselor is not present, and maybe they had a major personal issue in their life today and are still showing up at this meeting, and I'd like you to give them a little grace.

1557
02:35:33,693 --> 02:35:34,514
[SPEAKER_44]: It's not constant.

1558
02:35:41,713 --> 02:35:41,993
[SPEAKER_44]: What?

1559
02:35:43,735 --> 02:35:44,316
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks, Steve.

1560
02:35:44,616 --> 02:35:47,199
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll see about that.

1561
02:35:47,219 --> 02:35:50,702
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, Steve.

1562
02:35:51,103 --> 02:35:54,546
[SPEAKER_21]: Please direct your comments to the chair and please avoid your personal diatribes.

1563
02:35:54,626 --> 02:35:54,967
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1564
02:35:56,260 --> 02:35:59,082
[SPEAKER_44]: So anyways, as I was saying, I find that to be offensive.

1565
02:35:59,462 --> 02:36:16,132
[SPEAKER_44]: The next thing I wanted to talk about is it seems like in this whole process that the city council has seemed to attack the residents, anyone that opposed this project, they tried to characterize them as against people that are suffering from addiction.

1566
02:36:16,432 --> 02:36:19,074
[SPEAKER_44]: So I wanted to start by saying the organization that I work

1567
02:36:19,674 --> 02:36:27,961
[SPEAKER_44]: With, we have four full-time drug and alcohol counselors that also deal with mental health that work seven days a week.

1568
02:36:27,981 --> 02:36:29,502
[SPEAKER_44]: They're on call 24-7.

1569
02:36:29,843 --> 02:36:36,068
[SPEAKER_44]: And when one of our members has a crisis, they go right to their house, pick them up, drop them off at a treatment center.

1570
02:36:36,428 --> 02:36:42,535
[SPEAKER_44]: So I just want to say that up front, as I am also opposed to this project.

1571
02:36:43,316 --> 02:36:49,663
[SPEAKER_44]: But another thing about that, so I'm aware that the city doesn't have a drug and alcohol counselor, is that correct?

1572
02:36:53,462 --> 02:36:54,722
[SPEAKER_44]: so you're not gonna answer the question.

1573
02:36:54,742 --> 02:36:55,282
[SPEAKER_44]: Well, they don't.

1574
02:36:55,623 --> 02:36:57,823
[SPEAKER_21]: In cities like- That's not true, we do have a- Oh, you do?

1575
02:36:57,863 --> 02:36:58,863
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a social team, yeah, thank you.

1576
02:36:58,903 --> 02:37:01,464
[SPEAKER_44]: You have a certified drug and alcohol counselor that works for the city?

1577
02:37:01,484 --> 02:37:02,144
[SPEAKER_44]: Please continue your comments.

1578
02:37:02,464 --> 02:37:09,446
[SPEAKER_44]: The answer's no, but cities like Malden do have full-time employees on their city staff that deal with those issues.

1579
02:37:09,946 --> 02:37:20,609
[SPEAKER_44]: So about four weeks ago, the city created a new position of assistant DPW director, which the DPW workers have no idea why that person was hired,

1580
02:37:21,169 --> 02:37:25,450
[SPEAKER_44]: what the purpose of the job is, so maybe you could use the funds a little better.

1581
02:37:25,850 --> 02:37:27,231
[SPEAKER_44]: And my last point is this.

1582
02:37:27,711 --> 02:37:38,114
[SPEAKER_44]: So through this meeting, and I was at the previous meeting, I've heard you say, Zach, and I'll paraphrase, you said something along the lines of, we had nothing to do with this process.

1583
02:37:38,514 --> 02:37:44,336
[SPEAKER_44]: I heard Mr. Tseng say, don't take our silence for we were supportive.

1584
02:37:44,636 --> 02:37:47,597
[SPEAKER_44]: But I would ask, why did none of the city councilors

1585
02:37:48,377 --> 02:38:03,464
[SPEAKER_44]: speak out against this project, except for Mr. Scarpelli, when it's right next to or right near a bike shop, an elementary school, a karate studio, a dance studio, restaurants, a residential area.

1586
02:38:04,364 --> 02:38:15,369
[SPEAKER_44]: And I think Mr. Singh alluded to the fact that maybe you were told by legal counsel to not comment, but clearly that's a silly comment.

1587
02:38:15,429 --> 02:38:16,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

1588
02:38:16,110 --> 02:38:16,910
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you very much.

1589
02:38:20,646 --> 02:38:41,798
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I would once again note that given the Chapter 48 zoning process and that the Zoning Board of Appeals is a special permit-granting authority, it is generally not recommended for the Council to insert politics into situations or to be serving as political actors in permitting processes because it opens the cities up to liability and lawsuit.

1590
02:38:41,818 --> 02:38:43,319
[SPEAKER_21]: Would you like to speak?

1591
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:45,120
[SPEAKER_21]: Name and address for the record, please.

1592
02:38:45,140 --> 02:38:45,761
[SPEAKER_21]: You have three minutes.

1593
02:38:47,711 --> 02:38:49,293
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Martha Andrus.

1594
02:38:49,673 --> 02:38:52,657
[SPEAKER_24]: I live at 45 Kilgore Avenue in Medford.

1595
02:38:53,838 --> 02:38:54,940
[SPEAKER_24]: I was about to go to bed.

1596
02:38:54,960 --> 02:39:07,535
[SPEAKER_24]: I was watching this on TV and I felt I had to come down here and say something because I was hearing people with addiction referred to in vile terms.

1597
02:39:09,756 --> 02:39:22,221
[SPEAKER_24]: I hope that Medford, whatever the regulatory and governance issues are, hope that Medford can provide more and better facilities for people with addiction to get treatment.

1598
02:39:23,782 --> 02:39:27,103
[SPEAKER_24]: I myself have lost a nephew to overdose.

1599
02:39:29,504 --> 02:39:36,147
[SPEAKER_24]: My son's best friend died of an overdose leaving a four-year-old son.

1600
02:39:38,456 --> 02:39:42,437
[SPEAKER_24]: I have lost, I'm not gonna start counting the people we've lost.

1601
02:39:43,898 --> 02:39:45,258
[SPEAKER_24]: This is important.

1602
02:39:46,358 --> 02:39:47,359
[SPEAKER_24]: This is human.

1603
02:39:48,879 --> 02:39:57,242
[SPEAKER_24]: Jesus Christ said, even as you do it unto the least of these, you do it unto me.

1604
02:39:58,702 --> 02:40:03,084
[SPEAKER_24]: If people have any interest in what Jesus Christ said, they might wanna think about that.

1605
02:40:04,984 --> 02:40:07,265
[SPEAKER_24]: I hope that either through this body

1606
02:40:08,948 --> 02:40:20,136
[SPEAKER_24]: or some other process, we are able to get facilities such as a methadone dispensary or whatever you want to call it, a place people can get treatment.

1607
02:40:21,617 --> 02:40:24,079
[SPEAKER_24]: And that is part of the treatment that's available.

1608
02:40:24,159 --> 02:40:25,019
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not perfect.

1609
02:40:26,680 --> 02:40:29,342
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a whole lot better than leaving people to die.

1610
02:40:31,444 --> 02:40:37,068
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just ask that people look into their hearts and try to find,

1611
02:40:38,868 --> 02:40:40,889
[SPEAKER_24]: for those people who need this treatment.

1612
02:40:40,949 --> 02:40:41,350
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1613
02:40:43,391 --> 02:40:44,311
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your comment.

1614
02:40:47,233 --> 02:40:55,938
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just want to say for my record, since we're throwing around the shame on thing, the people in the room laughing at that comment, I'm disappointed in you.

1615
02:40:56,618 --> 02:40:57,579
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

1616
02:41:00,780 --> 02:41:01,661
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, President Beas.

1617
02:41:01,941 --> 02:41:03,542
[SPEAKER_29]: I want to thank everybody who spoke.

1618
02:41:09,366 --> 02:41:22,311
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that this is, you know, with any issue that we don't have consensus on, you know, lately, it seems like it's pretty easy for things to get polarized.

1619
02:41:23,717 --> 02:41:39,496
[SPEAKER_29]: When I listen to almost, not everybody, but almost everybody who's spoken on this issue at this meeting or who's emailed or called me or spoke at our last meeting, when I listen to almost all of those comments without any exception, I really do think that we all want the same thing.

1620
02:41:39,997 --> 02:41:40,417
[SPEAKER_29]: I've heard

1621
02:41:41,735 --> 02:41:45,316
[SPEAKER_29]: Very, very few number of people say, I actually don't want this anywhere in Medford.

1622
02:41:45,336 --> 02:41:46,876
[SPEAKER_29]: I think this has no place in Medford.

1623
02:41:46,916 --> 02:41:49,037
[SPEAKER_29]: I've heard a very few number of people say that.

1624
02:41:49,577 --> 02:41:50,537
[SPEAKER_29]: I personally don't believe that.

1625
02:41:50,998 --> 02:41:52,318
[SPEAKER_29]: I think this has a place in Medford.

1626
02:41:52,778 --> 02:41:55,059
[SPEAKER_29]: That doesn't mean it should go any place in Medford.

1627
02:41:55,699 --> 02:41:56,319
[SPEAKER_29]: I agree with that.

1628
02:41:56,679 --> 02:41:58,880
[SPEAKER_29]: The success of the mission depends on where we put it.

1629
02:41:59,540 --> 02:42:06,342
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think everybody who's come forward and said, I'm really concerned about where this was proposed to go, that's totally reasonable.

1630
02:42:08,143 --> 02:42:11,685
[SPEAKER_29]: If anybody's felt vilified for having that opinion, I'm sorry.

1631
02:42:12,526 --> 02:42:14,027
[SPEAKER_29]: I would never want anybody to feel that way.

1632
02:42:15,208 --> 02:42:21,512
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't think that you should be made to feel bad for voicing your opinion about where this should go or where it's going to be most successful.

1633
02:42:22,132 --> 02:42:29,477
[SPEAKER_29]: I know some people are motivated by their neighborhood concerns and other people are motivated by, I don't think this is gonna be most successful here, this doesn't make sense.

1634
02:42:30,018 --> 02:42:35,902
[SPEAKER_29]: If this should go in a commercial or industrial area, why don't we have the tools currently in place to put it there?

1635
02:42:37,136 --> 02:42:39,117
[SPEAKER_29]: That's actually under the jurisdiction of this body.

1636
02:42:39,617 --> 02:42:47,219
[SPEAKER_29]: That's what we have the power to do we've been working for a very long time, more terms that I've been on the council to get to a point where we have the resources to make those changes.

1637
02:42:47,899 --> 02:42:52,801
[SPEAKER_29]: When it comes to medical offices when it comes to many other uses so we can start finally start making decisions.

1638
02:42:53,641 --> 02:42:57,324
[SPEAKER_29]: That could be answers to the question of why don't we have X here?

1639
02:42:57,584 --> 02:42:58,805
[SPEAKER_29]: Why don't we have Y here?

1640
02:42:59,346 --> 02:43:03,609
[SPEAKER_29]: Why doesn't Medford look more like XYZ the way I want it to, the way it used to?

1641
02:43:03,629 --> 02:43:08,653
[SPEAKER_29]: We're finally amassing the resources to make those changes.

1642
02:43:08,693 --> 02:43:09,754
[SPEAKER_29]: They're not fast to make.

1643
02:43:10,214 --> 02:43:11,235
[SPEAKER_29]: We can't make them quickly.

1644
02:43:11,915 --> 02:43:12,696
[SPEAKER_29]: It's too technical.

1645
02:43:12,756 --> 02:43:13,477
[SPEAKER_29]: It's too detailed.

1646
02:43:13,597 --> 02:43:19,041
[SPEAKER_29]: That's a very unglamorous, but I think well-known thing about government is if you do it fast, you might do it wrong.

1647
02:43:19,061 --> 02:43:21,443
[SPEAKER_29]: And this is too important to not get right.

1648
02:43:24,551 --> 02:43:32,693
[SPEAKER_29]: But I just want to reinforce that when I hear people talk about this, I really think that we all, with some very, very few exceptions, we know that this has a place in Medford.

1649
02:43:33,253 --> 02:43:39,455
[SPEAKER_29]: We know that we want to take excellent care of the people whose lives will be better off for having this available.

1650
02:43:39,955 --> 02:43:42,696
[SPEAKER_29]: We know that there are people in Medford who do need this available.

1651
02:43:43,476 --> 02:43:46,837
[SPEAKER_29]: We know that we should find the best possible place for this to go.

1652
02:43:46,857 --> 02:43:50,378
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't think that this shared cause is advanced by

1653
02:43:52,439 --> 02:43:59,865
[SPEAKER_29]: using this forum to spread disinformation, such as there being a backroom deal to bring this into or to target a residential neighborhood.

1654
02:44:00,325 --> 02:44:01,346
[SPEAKER_29]: Of course that didn't happen.

1655
02:44:02,026 --> 02:44:02,867
[SPEAKER_29]: That would never happen.

1656
02:44:04,188 --> 02:44:05,289
[SPEAKER_29]: That's nobody's goals here.

1657
02:44:05,309 --> 02:44:11,394
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't think this conversation is advanced by being resolute to be at war over this.

1658
02:44:12,074 --> 02:44:13,175
[SPEAKER_29]: We're all on the same team here.

1659
02:44:13,916 --> 02:44:19,120
[SPEAKER_29]: If we want to be at war about this, if people in this room or people in this conversation are resolved to be at war about this,

1660
02:44:20,595 --> 02:44:22,598
[SPEAKER_29]: we can drag this congregation down into the mud.

1661
02:44:23,339 --> 02:44:24,040
[SPEAKER_29]: That's optional.

1662
02:44:24,500 --> 02:44:29,387
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think that's completely, completely orthogonal to everybody's goals here.

1663
02:44:31,089 --> 02:44:31,409
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1664
02:44:33,832 --> 02:44:34,173
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1665
02:44:36,547 --> 02:44:40,890
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, 24-424, recommendation for the License Commission.

1666
02:44:40,930 --> 02:44:41,811
[SPEAKER_21]: Reappointment requests.

1667
02:44:42,071 --> 02:45:03,327
[SPEAKER_21]: Dear President Bears and members of the City Council, I respect the request and recommend that your honorable body, in accordance with Massachusetts General Law Chapter 138, sections four and five, approve the reappointments of Alan Martirana, registered Republican, 25 Blakely Road, Medford, MA, 02155, and Ben O'Sullivan Pierce, registered Democrat, 10 Tyrell Road, Medford, MA, 02155,

1668
02:45:04,668 --> 02:45:06,889
[SPEAKER_21]: to the License Commission for a term of six years each.

1669
02:45:07,289 --> 02:45:11,211
[SPEAKER_21]: To expire June 1, 2030, both Alan and Ben will be present via Zoom.

1670
02:45:11,551 --> 02:45:13,632
[SPEAKER_21]: Copies of their resumes and appointments letters are attached.

1671
02:45:14,072 --> 02:45:20,595
[SPEAKER_21]: Already serving, Robert Delafano, registered unenrolled independent, 65 Hume Avenue, Medford MA 02155.

1672
02:45:20,996 --> 02:45:22,516
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

1673
02:45:22,556 --> 02:45:24,197
[SPEAKER_21]: Sincerely, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

1674
02:45:27,238 --> 02:45:31,961
[SPEAKER_21]: We may, I see Ben, and I saw Alan earlier.

1675
02:45:33,140 --> 02:45:36,043
[SPEAKER_21]: We may have lost him due to the late hour.

1676
02:45:38,005 --> 02:45:41,808
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Chief of Staff, do you wanna share anything about these applicants?

1677
02:45:45,231 --> 02:45:58,204
[SPEAKER_21]: And if I am correct, I just wanted to, and you can correct me, state law requires the License Commission to have partisan balance because of probably 100 years ago, we're only given licenses to people from our own party, something like that.

1678
02:45:59,215 --> 02:46:00,515
[SPEAKER_27]: I honestly don't know the history.

1679
02:46:00,675 --> 02:46:02,736
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, President Bears, members of the council.

1680
02:46:02,776 --> 02:46:11,979
[SPEAKER_27]: I honestly don't know the history there, but as you stated, that was what I was coming up to state, that there has to be a balance between the commission members in terms of the two leading political parties.

1681
02:46:12,299 --> 02:46:12,699
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

1682
02:46:14,760 --> 02:46:17,981
[SPEAKER_21]: If there's anything you want to add about the applicants, it looks like they are for reappointment.

1683
02:46:18,681 --> 02:46:19,761
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, that's my understanding.

1684
02:46:19,982 --> 02:46:27,744
[SPEAKER_27]: Nothing specific other than what's contained in the council's packet and any questions the council may have for the individuals themselves.

1685
02:46:28,100 --> 02:46:28,380
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

1686
02:46:29,721 --> 02:46:31,262
[SPEAKER_21]: I do see Ben O'Sullivan Pierce.

1687
02:46:31,342 --> 02:46:36,986
[SPEAKER_21]: Ben, if there's anything you'd like to say at this time, feel free to raise your hand or wave at me and I can unmute you.

1688
02:46:39,768 --> 02:46:41,530
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing he's all set.

[SPEAKER_13]: That was a yes.

1704
02:47:23,358 --> 02:47:25,740
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, 7 the affirmative, none the negative, the motion passes.

1783
02:53:28,875 --> 02:53:41,565

1784
02:53:41,585 --> 02:53:44,807

1788
02:53:55,041 --> 02:53:56,081

1806

02:56:49,752 --> 02:56:52,458
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

1818
02:56:54,082 --> 02:56:54,383

1819
02:56:54,483 --> 02:56:55,967
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I have an affirmative, none in the negative.

1820
02:56:55,987 --> 02:56:56,909
[SPEAKER_21]: The motion passes.

1821
02:56:59,252 --> 02:57:22,230
[SPEAKER_21]: 24420 petition for a common victor's license, raising cane restaurant on file, business certificate 2023 number 106, petition received, letter of compliance received, state tax ID received, workers' compensation received, treasure collector pending final approval, building department pending final approval, fire department pending final approval, police traffic impact pending final approval, and health department pending final approval.

1822
02:57:23,290 --> 02:57:28,074
[SPEAKER_21]: Before I recognize the council for the petitioner, I just want to note that we have

1823
02:57:28,554 --> 02:57:35,918
[SPEAKER_21]: recently done, I think, a relatively similar conditional common victual license pending those approvals on these issuance of an occupancy permit.

1824
02:57:36,278 --> 02:57:37,859
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just wanted to put out that context.

1825
02:57:38,279 --> 02:57:45,703
[SPEAKER_21]: With that, I will turn over to hear from our petitioner, Kathy Desmond, from representing Rice and Gates.

1826
02:57:45,903 --> 02:57:48,524
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you, President Pierce.

1827
02:57:49,205 --> 02:57:53,987
[SPEAKER_48]: I'm here this evening requesting a conditional common victual license.

1828
02:57:54,407 --> 02:57:55,028
[SPEAKER_48]: At this point,

1829
02:57:56,257 --> 02:57:59,260
[SPEAKER_48]: the client is waiting for the power to turn on.

1830
02:57:59,280 --> 02:58:13,734
[SPEAKER_48]: And at that point, he will be at a position where they can turn the matter over to operations, which it would be a lot smoother for them if they were able to be able to turn it over following the final inspections.

1831
02:58:15,015 --> 02:58:16,756
[SPEAKER_48]: The construction is substantially completed.

1832
02:58:16,816 --> 02:58:20,480
[SPEAKER_48]: The landscaping is also substantially completed at this time.

1833
02:58:22,409 --> 02:58:26,251
[SPEAKER_48]: And so they've complied with all of the requirements other than the final inspections.

1834
02:58:26,671 --> 02:58:33,656
[SPEAKER_48]: Unfortunately, they have to wait until the power gets turned on to be able to get those inspections done, but they're otherwise ready.

1835
02:58:36,357 --> 02:58:36,817
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1836
02:58:36,957 --> 02:58:38,238
[SPEAKER_21]: Any questions for the petitioner?

1837
02:58:42,341 --> 02:58:44,242
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing none, I'm going to open the public hearing.

1838
02:58:45,242 --> 02:58:49,525
[SPEAKER_21]: Public hearing is open to people in favor, in opposition, or otherwise would like to comment on this project.

1839
02:58:51,320 --> 02:58:54,302
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, Sylvia.

1840
02:58:54,322 --> 02:58:55,322
[SPEAKER_21]: Public hearing is open.

1841
02:58:56,803 --> 02:58:58,084
[SPEAKER_48]: Kathleen Desmond for the petitioner.

1842
02:58:58,444 --> 02:59:14,112
[SPEAKER_48]: We would ask at this point where we have gotten both of our special permits, construction is substantially complete and the landscaping is substantially complete, that the common mutual license be issued conditionally on certificate of occupancy and final inspections so that they can advance to the operation stage.

1843
02:59:17,003 --> 02:59:24,427
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyone else on Zoom or in the chamber who would like to comment on this Common Vixer's license request?

1844
02:59:29,010 --> 02:59:33,452
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing no one in the chamber and no hands on Zoom, I declare the public hearing closed.

1845
02:59:34,353 --> 02:59:35,633
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there a motion on the floor?

[SPEAKER_21]: respectfully submitted Breanna Lungo-Koehn Mayor.

1909
03:02:41,323 --> 03:02:42,586
[SPEAKER_21]: And before I turn it over to you.

1910
03:02:43,328 --> 03:02:53,835
[SPEAKER_21]: manager Dupont, I just wanted to clarify my understanding that we are approving kind of the overall allocation, but then you will go through your standard project to approve these specific projects.

1911
03:02:53,915 --> 03:03:06,662
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, there will at least be 207 or so thousand on open space spent, 207,000 historical reservation, 310,000 or so on housing, and then the rest would be distributed amongst those categories.

1912
03:03:06,682 --> 03:03:07,343
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that correct?

1913
03:03:07,723 --> 03:03:08,103
[SPEAKER_36]: Correct.

1914
03:03:08,504 --> 03:03:08,744
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

1915
03:03:08,944 --> 03:03:09,184
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1916
03:03:09,224 --> 03:03:10,325
[SPEAKER_21]: Then with that, I will turn it over to you.

1917
03:03:11,836 --> 03:03:15,659
[SPEAKER_36]: So thank you again for making the time to speak with us about this.

1918
03:03:16,540 --> 03:03:20,964
[SPEAKER_36]: Just to clarify, I just want to do a very brief overview of how we got to this number.

1919
03:03:21,905 --> 03:03:26,688
[SPEAKER_36]: CPA revenue is raised through a property tax surcharge.

1920
03:03:26,728 --> 03:03:28,810
[SPEAKER_36]: It's a surcharge on top of taxes that are paid.

1921
03:03:29,251 --> 03:03:35,596
[SPEAKER_36]: This is a pretty hard, fast number that we can easily calculate based upon assessment values and what have you.

1922
03:03:36,216 --> 03:03:39,419
[SPEAKER_36]: So the base amount here, which math,

1923
03:03:40,578 --> 03:03:43,999
[SPEAKER_36]: about 1.8 I believe was the surcharge amount.

1924
03:03:44,780 --> 03:03:45,620
[SPEAKER_36]: So that is our base.

1925
03:03:45,700 --> 03:03:51,102
[SPEAKER_36]: On top of that, the state does provide a CPA match money that comes to us every year.

1926
03:03:51,142 --> 03:03:55,344
[SPEAKER_36]: That money does come from the registry of deeds transactions a little bit.

1927
03:03:55,694 --> 03:04:01,999
[SPEAKER_36]: gets skimmed off the top there and gets put into the state match money that comes to us as a city.

1928
03:04:02,980 --> 03:04:06,824
[SPEAKER_36]: So this year, the state match amount was only 14 and a half percent.

1929
03:04:06,864 --> 03:04:14,871
[SPEAKER_36]: We have been benefiting from some really heavy transactions at the registry of deeds over COVID here, the pandemic, people were buying houses.

1930
03:04:14,931 --> 03:04:18,574
[SPEAKER_36]: So there was more revenue to come into the CPA coffers.

1931
03:04:19,074 --> 03:04:35,980
[SPEAKER_36]: So just to explain to where we came to this $2,068,920, it is a combination of the surcharge raised locally, as well as that 14.4% state match that is estimated from the registry of dates.

1932
03:04:37,679 --> 03:04:48,131
[SPEAKER_36]: I will want to point out that we made a, again, each of the three categories, open space, historic preservation, and affordable housing by state legislature.

1933
03:04:48,171 --> 03:04:53,978
[SPEAKER_36]: We must spend a minimum of 10% or allocate 10% of our budget towards these projects.

1934
03:04:54,659 --> 03:05:01,065
[SPEAKER_36]: You will notice that in affordable housing, that is a slightly higher number than the other two categories of open space and historic.

1935
03:05:01,185 --> 03:05:10,014
[SPEAKER_36]: That is because the committee elected to increase voluntarily our allocation for housing to 15% to explain the differences in costs there.

1936
03:05:12,174 --> 03:05:19,777
[SPEAKER_36]: As well, I just wanted to also point out the administrative bucket that is in here, that is for costs associated with executing the grant program.

1937
03:05:20,197 --> 03:05:28,700
[SPEAKER_36]: Pays my salary, it pays any other costs, our consulting fees, what have you, in order to support this program here in the city.

1938
03:05:31,041 --> 03:05:32,362
[SPEAKER_36]: And I'm happy to answer any questions.

1939
03:05:33,302 --> 03:05:33,662
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1940
03:05:34,562 --> 03:05:38,884
[SPEAKER_21]: Any questions regarding the base allocation for CPC funds for

1941
03:05:40,501 --> 03:05:41,041
[SPEAKER_21]: fiscal 25.

1942
03:05:41,101 --> 03:05:43,582
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

1943
03:05:44,283 --> 03:05:45,023
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, President Burris.

1944
03:05:45,343 --> 03:05:47,244
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you so much for being here and sticking with us.

1945
03:05:48,164 --> 03:06:00,890
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't have any specific questions on the appropriation requested, but I do always appreciate an overview of where CPA funding comes from, the very strict rules regulating what it may be spent on and in what proportion.

1946
03:06:01,590 --> 03:06:06,532
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm glad to see that the CPC voted to increase voluntarily the amount that we're spending on community housing.

1947
03:06:06,992 --> 03:06:10,956
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that that's a value that's shared by many in the community, and I'm sure that'll be welcome news to many.

1948
03:06:11,457 --> 03:06:18,985
[SPEAKER_29]: So of course, all of the uses that CPA money can be spent on are, you know, we can look all around and see the benefit that they do throughout Medford.

1949
03:06:19,706 --> 03:06:22,909
[SPEAKER_29]: So thank you so much for walking us through this, but I'm excited to approve this tonight.

1950
03:06:24,701 --> 03:06:26,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1951
03:06:26,322 --> 03:06:27,942
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, and I appreciate all your hard work.

1952
03:06:28,002 --> 03:06:34,344
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that when we are committed to support the CPA, I think that there's some clarity maybe you can help with.

1953
03:06:34,424 --> 03:06:41,147
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that when we first voted for this, it was a matching number by the state, correct, at the time?

1954
03:06:42,168 --> 03:06:42,769
[SPEAKER_36]: And it still is.

1955
03:06:42,989 --> 03:06:43,410
[SPEAKER_16]: It still is.

1956
03:06:43,590 --> 03:06:44,351
[SPEAKER_16]: Have we seen that?

1957
03:06:44,551 --> 03:06:45,732
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we getting that money?

1958
03:06:45,753 --> 03:06:46,694
[SPEAKER_16]: We receive it every year.

1959
03:06:47,034 --> 03:06:47,354
[SPEAKER_16]: Every year?

1960
03:06:47,455 --> 03:06:48,135
[SPEAKER_16]: And how much is that?

1961
03:06:48,676 --> 03:06:49,677
[SPEAKER_36]: It varies per year.

1962
03:06:49,777 --> 03:06:57,527
[SPEAKER_36]: Again, as I explained, it's based off of the transactions that happen at the registry of these across the state.

1963
03:06:57,968 --> 03:07:00,611
[SPEAKER_36]: So that amount, as you can guess, is kind of

1964
03:07:01,417 --> 03:07:04,778
[SPEAKER_36]: an estimate, but so every year it changes.

1965
03:07:04,878 --> 03:07:17,643
[SPEAKER_36]: It's, it's been as high as I believe 41 and a half ish percent in 2021, but this year there, the DOR provided us with that strong advice to estimate low.

1966
03:07:17,803 --> 03:07:22,324
[SPEAKER_36]: So that 14 and a 14.4% actually came directly from DOR.

1967
03:07:22,785 --> 03:07:24,465
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's 14% this year.

1968
03:07:24,705 --> 03:07:28,206
[SPEAKER_36]: That is what they're advising for all CPA communities to estimate this year.

1969
03:07:28,226 --> 03:07:28,407
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1970
03:07:29,227 --> 03:07:29,507
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1971
03:07:31,394 --> 03:07:31,774
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1972
03:07:31,994 --> 03:07:32,915
[SPEAKER_21]: Any council member?

1973
03:07:34,315 --> 03:07:34,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1974
03:07:34,556 --> 03:07:43,320
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just like to thank you for figures two and three, which very clearly show the amount that has been matched by the state every year since 2018.

1975
03:07:43,880 --> 03:07:53,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, as well as figure three, which very clearly shows that historically they're 29% of CPA funds have gone towards affordable housing.

1976
03:07:54,165 --> 03:07:59,648
[SPEAKER_11]: I would recommend modestly that maybe the color coding is could be updated because we get these in

1977
03:08:00,488 --> 03:08:02,730
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm sure it looked beautiful when it was colored.

1978
03:08:03,090 --> 03:08:04,431
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks beautiful in the PDF.

1979
03:08:04,491 --> 03:08:08,333
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks absolutely wonderful, very clear in the online PDF.

1980
03:08:08,453 --> 03:08:20,520
[SPEAKER_11]: But I will say that just in the printed version, it's not quite clear that the state matching has been very consistent year to year, in spite of what has often been said in these chambers.

1981
03:08:20,620 --> 03:08:22,281
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you very much for that.

1982
03:08:22,921 --> 03:08:24,342
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

1983
03:08:24,382 --> 03:08:26,804
[SPEAKER_36]: I try to be sensitive to visual impairments.

1984
03:08:26,824 --> 03:08:27,564
[SPEAKER_36]: So that's it.

1985
03:08:27,804 --> 03:08:28,565
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you for pointing that out.

1986
03:08:29,039 --> 03:08:33,541
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, if you can get us a color printer in the clerk's office, that would be a start.

1987
03:08:33,561 --> 03:08:35,641
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay, I'll work on that.

1988
03:08:35,681 --> 03:08:37,222
[SPEAKER_21]: No, not your job.

1989
03:08:37,282 --> 03:08:43,424
[SPEAKER_21]: That was a message for the ether and for others in the room like our chief of staff and our finance director.

1990
03:08:45,165 --> 03:08:47,626
[SPEAKER_21]: I just wanted to note one other thing about this.

1991
03:08:47,986 --> 03:08:55,669
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe we can find this copy of this plan on the CPC page on the city website or on the Preserve Medford page or both.

1992
03:08:57,300 --> 03:09:04,344
[SPEAKER_36]: It is on the preserve Medford page, however, I believe that you're pointing out that it should be uploaded to the website and I will rectify that tomorrow morning.

1993
03:09:04,404 --> 03:09:07,166
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no, it wasn't my, I didn't know if it was or wasn't.

1994
03:09:07,286 --> 03:09:08,046
[SPEAKER_36]: It should be out there.

1995
03:09:08,327 --> 03:09:13,550
[SPEAKER_21]: It's also available, I believe in color on the city council's agenda and meeting minutes portal.

1996
03:09:13,770 --> 03:09:21,195
[SPEAKER_21]: If you were to go to the agenda, the item files for 24417, you can find a copy of that PDF there as well.

1997
03:09:23,797 --> 03:09:24,397
[SPEAKER_21]: Chair Cameron.

1998
03:09:25,353 --> 03:09:25,893
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you.

1999
03:09:26,334 --> 03:09:37,180
[SPEAKER_45]: I want to commend to everyone, Teresa's presentation of the budget and everyone's understanding of the CPA budget and the rules that go into creating the budget.

2000
03:09:37,540 --> 03:09:40,922
[SPEAKER_45]: There was just one point of clarification that I thought might be helpful.

2001
03:09:41,362 --> 03:09:53,429
[SPEAKER_45]: And that is that while the CPC has to dedicate a minimum of 10% to each program area each year, and we elected to increase our minimum to 15% for affordable housing,

2002
03:09:54,189 --> 03:10:03,913
[SPEAKER_45]: the remaining 60% of our budget that is in the general reserve can be used in any of those three program areas.

2003
03:10:04,573 --> 03:10:16,898
[SPEAKER_45]: And we've established an unwritten goal throughout the history of the CPA program to try to keep the spending about even between the three program areas.

2004
03:10:17,278 --> 03:10:22,860
[SPEAKER_45]: And that's reflected in the numbers in the pie chart that's in the table that's in the report that you see.

2005
03:10:23,393 --> 03:10:31,455
[SPEAKER_45]: We've spent about a third of the funding in each of the three program areas historically and in last year specifically.

2006
03:10:32,035 --> 03:10:44,679
[SPEAKER_45]: And that really critical community projects are elevated in that report that have been completed over the history of the program in each of the three program areas.

2007
03:10:45,459 --> 03:10:48,520
[SPEAKER_45]: We've spent in the last six years,

2008
03:10:49,068 --> 03:11:14,931
[SPEAKER_45]: approximately $12 million on projects to improve the city of Medford, including about 95 projects, open space, recreation parks across the city, major housing development projects, emergency rental assistance to make sure that landlords can get paid when renters have a surprising loss of income due to COVID.

2009
03:11:15,886 --> 03:11:21,210
[SPEAKER_45]: and historic preservation projects that are enabling transformative impacts in the community.

2010
03:11:21,290 --> 03:11:27,515
[SPEAKER_45]: So I really encourage everyone to read that report on what the CPA program has been doing.

2011
03:11:28,096 --> 03:11:28,816
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you very much.

2012
03:11:29,757 --> 03:11:30,177
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2013
03:11:30,197 --> 03:11:34,400
[SPEAKER_21]: And congratulations, trustee Cameron.

2014
03:11:35,461 --> 03:11:38,403
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for volunteering for another role.

2015
03:11:38,423 --> 03:11:40,145
[SPEAKER_45]: That's what I'm here for.

2016
03:11:43,207 --> 03:11:44,108
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice president Collins.

2017
03:11:45,052 --> 03:11:45,853
[SPEAKER_28]: I would motion to approve.

2018
03:11:45,873 --> 03:11:51,457
[SPEAKER_21]: I would motion Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

2019
03:11:51,977 --> 03:11:53,098
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

2020
03:11:53,498 --> 03:11:56,521
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think Sylvia is going to win the award for roll call slips tonight.

2021
03:11:57,141 --> 03:11:57,461
Yes.

2022
03:11:57,521 --> 03:11:57,862
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

2023
03:11:57,902 --> 03:11:58,842
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

2024
03:11:58,982 --> 03:11:59,203
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

2025
03:12:17,588 --> 03:12:19,330
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, 70% negative.

2026
03:12:19,871 --> 03:12:21,173
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much and this is approved.

2027
03:12:22,154 --> 03:12:23,236
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you on behalf of the committee.

2028
03:12:25,023 --> 03:12:28,004
[SPEAKER_21]: 24-421, Ordinance Creating a South Street Historic District.

2029
03:12:28,504 --> 03:12:40,810
[SPEAKER_21]: I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body adopt the enclosed ordinance proposed by the Medford Historic District Commission in accordance with the Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 40C, Section 3, Creating a South Street Historic District.

2030
03:12:41,210 --> 03:12:45,912
[SPEAKER_21]: A map of the South Street Historic District dated November 9, 2023 is also enclosed.

2031
03:12:46,353 --> 03:12:48,894
[SPEAKER_21]: In accordance with the requirements of establishing a historic district,

2032
03:12:49,594 --> 03:13:03,304
[SPEAKER_21]: One, an investigation and report was made by the Medford Historic District Commission with the support of a consultant, Skelly Preservation Services, and transmitted to the Community Development Board and the Massachusetts Historical Commission for their respective consideration and recommendations.

2033
03:13:03,785 --> 03:13:05,366
[SPEAKER_21]: Both entities have considered and recommend

2034
03:13:05,839 --> 03:13:30,349
[SPEAKER_21]: approval of the proposed South Street Historic District, encloses a copy of the Community Development Board recommendation to approve the creation of the South Street Local Historic District, and the Massachusetts Historical Commission discussed the proposed district at their September 13, 2023 meeting, for which they ultimately concluded and incorporated into their minutes that the quote, Massachusetts Historical Commission encourages the City of Medford to establish the South Street Local Historic District.

2035
03:13:30,896 --> 03:13:40,544
[SPEAKER_21]: The Medford Historic District Commission held a public hearing on February 8th, 2024, and notices were mailed in accordance to the statute to ordiners as they appear on the real estate tax list.

2036
03:13:41,184 --> 03:13:48,410
[SPEAKER_21]: And a final report dated February 20th, 2024, with recommendations by the Medford Historic District Commission is also enclosed.

2037
03:13:48,891 --> 03:13:55,236
[SPEAKER_21]: The above ordinance has been reviewed by Attorney Robin Stein at KP Law PC, and the recommended changes have been incorporated.

2038
03:13:55,716 --> 03:13:59,960
[SPEAKER_21]: Further, the sufficiency of the vote required by the council would be a two-thirds majority.

2039
03:14:00,560 --> 03:14:08,723
[SPEAKER_21]: Medford Historic District Commission Chairperson Christopher Bader will be in attendance to present this proposed ordinance to the council and answer any questions from the council.

2040
03:14:09,504 --> 03:14:10,644
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your consideration.

2041
03:14:10,704 --> 03:14:12,565
[SPEAKER_21]: Respectfully submitted, Brandon Lingo, current mayor.

2042
03:14:13,404 --> 03:14:14,405
[SPEAKER_21]: Chris, thank you for being here.

2043
03:14:14,425 --> 03:14:16,166
[SPEAKER_21]: I welcome you to the podium.

2044
03:14:17,047 --> 03:14:19,569
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I saw some other members of the commission here for a while.

2045
03:14:20,010 --> 03:14:21,010
[SPEAKER_21]: Has anyone stuck it out?

2046
03:14:21,050 --> 03:14:22,452
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you both for sticking it out.

2047
03:14:23,412 --> 03:14:29,037
[SPEAKER_21]: You're welcome to join at the podium if you'd like, and we're happy to hear the presentation.

2048
03:14:29,778 --> 03:14:34,422
[SPEAKER_21]: If you'd like, I'm also happy to read the proposed changes to the ordinance at some point.

2049
03:14:34,462 --> 03:14:35,082
[SPEAKER_21]: You just let me know.

2050
03:14:37,196 --> 03:14:41,777
[SPEAKER_41]: So I'd like to share my screen, if I can.

2051
03:14:41,817 --> 03:14:43,017
[SPEAKER_22]: Give me one moment.

2052
03:14:48,978 --> 03:14:50,798
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, give me two moments.

2053
03:15:03,101 --> 03:15:03,501
[SPEAKER_39]: There you go.

2054
03:15:03,541 --> 03:15:03,921
[SPEAKER_39]: Should be good.

2055
03:15:23,804 --> 03:15:33,788
[SPEAKER_21]: Then I think you need to click play from start.

2056
03:15:35,728 --> 03:15:36,909
[SPEAKER_21]: If you scroll up a little bit.

2057
03:15:38,063 --> 03:15:38,984
[SPEAKER_21]: You might have to scroll back.

2058
03:15:39,024 --> 03:15:42,346
[SPEAKER_21]: If you might have to go down, bring your cursor down and then scroll up.

2059
03:15:42,366 --> 03:15:56,275
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why it's not showing up.

2060
03:15:58,076 --> 03:16:00,137
[SPEAKER_21]: Justin, Matt.

2061
03:16:00,778 --> 03:16:03,239
[SPEAKER_21]: We're sending Gen Z. We're sending Gen Z out.

2062
03:16:04,520 --> 03:16:06,762
[SPEAKER_21]: Although technically, apparently millennials are better at computers.

2063
03:16:06,822 --> 03:16:07,102
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

2064
03:16:08,410 --> 03:16:09,711
[SPEAKER_21]: all that time on the smartphones.

2065
03:16:11,412 --> 03:16:12,273
[SPEAKER_41]: There we go, perfect.

2066
03:16:12,473 --> 03:16:13,053
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Justin.

2067
03:16:13,073 --> 03:16:17,617
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you for the invaluable technical support here.

2068
03:16:18,397 --> 03:16:22,620
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, so I'm here to talk about a proposed South Street historic district.

2069
03:16:23,361 --> 03:16:31,566
[SPEAKER_42]: As you all know, South Street is one of the most historic and beautiful portions of all of Manhattan.

2070
03:16:34,348 --> 03:16:34,849
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, okay.

2071
03:16:35,809 --> 03:16:36,370
[SPEAKER_42]: Can you hear me now?

2072
03:16:36,630 --> 03:16:36,870
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

2073
03:16:39,116 --> 03:16:47,162
[SPEAKER_42]: So yes, so South Street is one of the most beautiful and historic parts of Medford.

2074
03:16:47,182 --> 03:16:56,050
[SPEAKER_42]: It has particularly a large number of houses that were built before the Civil War by people, many of whom were associated with the shipbuilding industry.

2075
03:16:57,491 --> 03:17:02,214
[SPEAKER_42]: sea captains, wealthy merchants, timber merchants, and so on.

2076
03:17:03,315 --> 03:17:14,344
[SPEAKER_42]: So the ships that you see on the Medford seal is actually quite closely associated with South Street.

2077
03:17:14,364 --> 03:17:18,967
[SPEAKER_42]: So this is what South Street looked like in 1880.

2078
03:17:20,108 --> 03:17:20,548
[SPEAKER_42]: Almost, I think,

2079
03:17:27,031 --> 03:17:41,401
[SPEAKER_42]: Almost all the houses that we are proposing to protect in this historic district are actually on this map, all the way from Grandfather's House over here, down to 23 South Street down here.

2080
03:17:42,282 --> 03:17:50,507
[SPEAKER_42]: And of course, including 21 Toro, a beautiful federal revival,

2081
03:17:52,987 --> 03:17:57,230
[SPEAKER_42]: federal house on Turo Avenue.

2082
03:17:58,951 --> 03:18:03,914
[SPEAKER_42]: So let me just run through these houses very quickly.

2083
03:18:05,695 --> 03:18:07,356
[SPEAKER_42]: This is 12 Maple Avenue.

2084
03:18:07,376 --> 03:18:10,137
[SPEAKER_42]: You can see an absolutely beautiful house from 1845.

2085
03:18:10,217 --> 03:18:16,281
[SPEAKER_42]: Captain Redmond was the sea captain in the, associated with the Medford shipbuilding industry.

2086
03:18:16,781 --> 03:18:21,044
[SPEAKER_42]: I put asterisks next to people who were associated with the shipbuilding industry.

2087
03:18:22,581 --> 03:18:27,445
[SPEAKER_42]: Fannie Richardson was the, I believe, the widow or a daughter of a shipbuilder.

2088
03:18:28,947 --> 03:18:31,389
[SPEAKER_42]: This house was built in 1849.

2089
03:18:33,370 --> 03:18:39,015
[SPEAKER_42]: This house, well, I'll come back to talking about this house, but just please remember it.

2090
03:18:39,035 --> 03:18:46,401
[SPEAKER_42]: 30 South Street, 1835, another beautiful old house.

2091
03:18:47,422 --> 03:18:50,624
[SPEAKER_42]: Also, as in most of these houses, pre-Civil War.

2092
03:18:52,405 --> 03:18:56,428
[SPEAKER_42]: The Luther Turner house, Mr. Turner was a more, was not a wealthy man.

2093
03:18:56,969 --> 03:19:03,635
[SPEAKER_42]: He will, I believe he was, he worked in the, actually worked in the shipyards and he built this house in 1852.

2094
03:19:06,157 --> 03:19:15,026
[SPEAKER_42]: The Ann Butters house, this is a little bit later than the, this is little, this is post-Civil War, but there's another beautiful house right on South Street.

2095
03:19:17,914 --> 03:19:20,155
[SPEAKER_42]: 48 South Street, this is George Fuller's house.

2096
03:19:20,195 --> 03:19:26,137
[SPEAKER_42]: George Fuller was a, I believe he was a timber merchant that served the shipbuilding industry.

2097
03:19:26,517 --> 03:19:27,777
[SPEAKER_42]: He built this beautiful house in 1851.

2098
03:19:28,177 --> 03:19:39,861
[SPEAKER_42]: 54 South Street, now you may have heard of 54 South Street with the various hearings before the Zoning Board recently.

2099
03:19:41,861 --> 03:19:44,142
[SPEAKER_42]: This is a beautiful, beautiful house.

2100
03:19:44,182 --> 03:19:45,482
[SPEAKER_42]: I've seen it up close very,

2101
03:19:49,631 --> 03:19:51,512
[SPEAKER_42]: Up close, it even has original windows.

2102
03:19:51,592 --> 03:19:58,094
[SPEAKER_42]: This house has 19th century windows, which is quite unusual, even for this neighborhood.

2103
03:20:00,555 --> 03:20:03,256
[SPEAKER_42]: 60 South Street, I'll come back to this house.

2104
03:20:03,316 --> 03:20:06,338
[SPEAKER_42]: This is a somewhat later house, but also quite beautiful house.

2105
03:20:08,899 --> 03:20:14,521
[SPEAKER_42]: 66 South Street, 1855, the same year as another house in the district.

2106
03:20:16,316 --> 03:20:21,580
[SPEAKER_42]: 54, built in 1840, one of the earlier houses in the district.

2107
03:20:22,381 --> 03:20:33,870
[SPEAKER_42]: A person, something of note, a person, a 20th century poet who lived in Medford, John Chardy, actually grew up in this house.

2108
03:20:34,891 --> 03:20:39,855
[SPEAKER_42]: And he was a well-known poet in the 1950s and 60s, mainly.

2109
03:20:44,682 --> 03:20:49,466
[SPEAKER_42]: And 102 South Street, very early house in this district, also beautiful.

2110
03:20:50,907 --> 03:20:57,271
[SPEAKER_42]: And of course, Grandfather's House, 114 South Street, that was owned by Tufts University for years.

2111
03:20:59,841 --> 03:21:04,244
[SPEAKER_42]: but was sold to a developer without notice to anyone some years ago.

2112
03:21:04,724 --> 03:21:09,727
[SPEAKER_42]: There was quite a bit of contention about what was going to happen to this house when the developer bought it.

2113
03:21:10,568 --> 03:21:18,933
[SPEAKER_42]: The house, fortunately, was preserved, but they built a prefab out next to it that would have been reviewed.

2114
03:21:19,194 --> 03:21:25,878
[SPEAKER_42]: If this house had been in historic district at that time, that process would have been reviewed by us.

2115
03:21:27,848 --> 03:21:30,986
[SPEAKER_42]: 11 Toro Avenue, another early house.

2116
03:21:32,872 --> 03:21:44,920
[SPEAKER_42]: Now, 21 Toro, also owned by Tufts University, also sold to a developer about 10 years ago, also the source of much contention, a very beautiful house.

2117
03:21:46,841 --> 03:22:00,429
[SPEAKER_42]: And unlike what happened with Grandfather's House, this entire large lot was preserved in part due to a lot of community activism.

2118
03:22:03,680 --> 03:22:05,943
[SPEAKER_42]: One monastery, this is the oldest house in the district.

2119
03:22:06,824 --> 03:22:11,108
[SPEAKER_42]: And I'll come back and talk about this house as well.

2120
03:22:13,450 --> 03:22:19,176
[SPEAKER_42]: 15, Louisa Richardson was the, I believe the widow of a sea captain.

2121
03:22:20,197 --> 03:22:22,259
[SPEAKER_42]: She lived in this beautiful house.

2122
03:22:23,226 --> 03:22:27,448
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, so this is the proposed South Street Historic District.

2123
03:22:28,489 --> 03:22:30,910
[SPEAKER_42]: We held a number of hearings.

2124
03:22:32,171 --> 03:22:36,633
[SPEAKER_42]: In what the mayor sent you, mentioned just one hearing, we actually held two hearings.

2125
03:22:37,914 --> 03:22:49,540
[SPEAKER_42]: In one of them, in the first hearing, the owner of 6 to 8 Manning Street, this house right here, said, well, my house is just a generic,

2126
03:22:50,922 --> 03:22:54,043
[SPEAKER_42]: early 20th century triple-decker, why is it in the historic district?

2127
03:22:55,084 --> 03:23:02,047
[SPEAKER_42]: And we thought about it, we talked about it, we took a vote, and we decided to remove that house from the historic district.

2128
03:23:04,068 --> 03:23:15,093
[SPEAKER_42]: Because, you know, we hold hearings for a reason, we want to hear what people say, and I think this is evidence that we listen.

2129
03:23:17,381 --> 03:23:20,602
[SPEAKER_42]: There are two other owners who have expressed concerns.

2130
03:23:22,023 --> 03:23:26,404
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Johnson, who owns 23 South Street, has expressed concerns.

2131
03:23:27,364 --> 03:23:28,145
[SPEAKER_42]: He's a developer.

2132
03:23:28,825 --> 03:23:31,966
[SPEAKER_42]: We have worked with developers.

2133
03:23:32,006 --> 03:23:34,087
[SPEAKER_42]: I've been on this commission for 23 years.

2134
03:23:34,687 --> 03:23:39,188
[SPEAKER_42]: We have worked with developers year in and year out.

2135
03:23:39,809 --> 03:23:41,369
[SPEAKER_42]: We have nothing against development.

2136
03:23:41,689 --> 03:23:46,431
[SPEAKER_42]: In fact, the last people who would oppose development would have been the Victorians who built these houses.

2137
03:23:48,616 --> 03:23:57,880
[SPEAKER_42]: they believed in organic, sorry, they believed in changing buildings to meet the needs of changing times, and we believe in that too.

2138
03:23:58,380 --> 03:24:03,802
[SPEAKER_42]: We just want that change to be organic and in keeping with the character of the neighborhood.

2139
03:24:04,222 --> 03:24:12,306
[SPEAKER_42]: We have told Mr. Johnson that we will work with him in developing this house in a way that works for him as well as for the neighborhood.

2140
03:24:13,802 --> 03:24:17,945
[SPEAKER_42]: Another house that I want to talk about specifically, the owner's concerns.

2141
03:24:18,786 --> 03:24:21,788
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. King owns 60 South Street.

2142
03:24:22,509 --> 03:24:24,710
[SPEAKER_42]: This house was built in 1912.

2143
03:24:26,532 --> 03:24:33,617
[SPEAKER_42]: He said, well, why is it being included in this house if we're focusing on pre-Civil War buildings?

2144
03:24:34,377 --> 03:24:35,938
[SPEAKER_42]: Well, it's a beautiful house.

2145
03:24:36,018 --> 03:24:37,339
[SPEAKER_42]: It's over a century old.

2146
03:24:37,420 --> 03:24:39,421
[SPEAKER_42]: It's one of the keystones of this

2147
03:24:41,573 --> 03:24:47,136
[SPEAKER_42]: of this proposed historic district, and we feel that it should be retained in spite of being of somewhat later date.

2148
03:24:48,777 --> 03:24:53,060
[SPEAKER_42]: And let's see.

2149
03:24:53,120 --> 03:24:55,881
[SPEAKER_42]: Going here.

2150
03:24:57,842 --> 03:24:58,123
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, no.

2151
03:24:58,623 --> 03:24:59,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Last slide, please.

2152
03:24:59,764 --> 03:25:02,505
[SPEAKER_42]: No, no, it's not my last slide.

2153
03:25:02,685 --> 03:25:03,085
[SPEAKER_42]: Come on.

2154
03:25:10,210 --> 03:25:10,870
[SPEAKER_39]: It's not moving.

2155
03:25:15,256 --> 03:25:32,759
[SPEAKER_42]: All right, so I don't have any more substantial slides, but let me just say that, is everyone familiar with how a historic district is administered?

2156
03:25:33,220 --> 03:25:34,300
[SPEAKER_42]: Are all of you familiar with that?

2157
03:25:35,740 --> 03:25:36,120
[SPEAKER_42]: Everybody?

2158
03:25:37,180 --> 03:25:37,300
[SPEAKER_42]: No.

2159
03:25:38,341 --> 03:25:40,301
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, Mr. Leming, no, not so much?

2160
03:25:42,205 --> 03:25:42,465
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

2161
03:25:42,805 --> 03:25:43,666
[SPEAKER_42]: Go ahead.

2162
03:25:44,006 --> 03:25:44,266
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

2163
03:25:44,286 --> 03:25:55,493
[SPEAKER_42]: So, so basically, um, we have, um, in order to, um, to get a building permit in a historic district, you need a certificate of appropriateness from us.

2164
03:25:55,914 --> 03:25:57,094
[SPEAKER_42]: So we hold a hearing.

2165
03:25:57,114 --> 03:25:58,095
[SPEAKER_42]: We invite the neighbors.

2166
03:25:59,136 --> 03:26:02,638
[SPEAKER_42]: Um, we of course invite the owner and his architect if there is

2167
03:26:03,780 --> 03:26:19,183
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, sorry, we invite, we of course invite the owner, we invite the neighbors, and sometimes the owner brings the architect along, and we discuss two things, the design and the materials of the house.

2168
03:26:20,117 --> 03:26:34,726
[SPEAKER_42]: The design has to be in keeping, we encourage the design to be in keeping with the design of this existing house and preferably the design of the houses, the general design of the houses in the neighborhood.

2169
03:26:35,066 --> 03:26:36,647
[SPEAKER_42]: So design is one consideration.

2170
03:26:36,967 --> 03:26:38,808
[SPEAKER_42]: The second consideration is materials.

2171
03:26:39,288 --> 03:26:39,929
[SPEAKER_42]: We encourage,

2172
03:26:40,969 --> 03:26:59,541
[SPEAKER_42]: owners, architects, and developers to use historically appropriate materials, or at the very least, materials that closely resemble historic materials, so that at a distance you might not be able to tell that the clabberding was not, for example, made of wood.

2173
03:27:01,418 --> 03:27:03,220
[SPEAKER_42]: So design and materials, that's it.

2174
03:27:03,280 --> 03:27:05,401
[SPEAKER_42]: Those are the only considerations.

2175
03:27:05,461 --> 03:27:16,489
[SPEAKER_42]: We don't oppose in any way changing the footprint of the building, changing the height of the building.

2176
03:27:17,869 --> 03:27:25,214
[SPEAKER_42]: Basically anything that the original owner of the building might do, we would approve.

2177
03:27:25,615 --> 03:27:25,895
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, sir.

2178
03:27:29,913 --> 03:27:31,975
[SPEAKER_11]: So just two questions.

2179
03:27:31,995 --> 03:27:43,543
[SPEAKER_11]: So to clarify, if somebody wanted to build an ADU on their house and they lived in a historic district, then you would require that the ADU be built with materials similar to the one that are used to currently construct the house?

2180
03:27:43,843 --> 03:27:44,904
[SPEAKER_42]: We would encourage that, yes.

2181
03:27:45,764 --> 03:27:45,924
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

2182
03:27:46,165 --> 03:27:50,808
[SPEAKER_11]: The other one, and I've kind of been curious about this ever since I first saw this map a couple of months ago.

2183
03:27:53,420 --> 03:28:00,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you talk about the houses between, I believe it's 84 and 102, or are they just like newer buildings?

2184
03:28:00,943 --> 03:28:03,844
[SPEAKER_42]: These are newer buildings, mainly triple-deckers.

2185
03:28:04,704 --> 03:28:06,085
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, these are triple-deckers.

2186
03:28:06,425 --> 03:28:12,547
[SPEAKER_42]: And basically in the same category as this house that we, the 68 Manning that we removed at the request of the owner.

2187
03:28:12,587 --> 03:28:15,208
[SPEAKER_42]: These are houses that don't, oh my God.

2188
03:28:18,186 --> 03:28:19,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

2189
03:28:19,106 --> 03:28:19,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Use your arrow keys.

2190
03:28:20,027 --> 03:28:22,428
[SPEAKER_11]: You can go back with the arrow key.

2191
03:28:22,608 --> 03:28:24,029
[SPEAKER_42]: So when I get to my slide, yes.

2192
03:28:24,289 --> 03:28:25,409
[SPEAKER_42]: Design and materials.

2193
03:28:25,869 --> 03:28:28,831
[SPEAKER_42]: Design in keeping with the existing house and the character of the neighborhood.

2194
03:28:28,871 --> 03:28:30,491
[SPEAKER_42]: Materials keeping with the existing house.

2195
03:28:30,832 --> 03:28:33,353
[SPEAKER_42]: Accept as necessary for practical reasons.

2196
03:28:33,613 --> 03:28:42,517
[SPEAKER_42]: For example, it is often very inappropriate to replace a rotted window sill with another piece of wood.

2197
03:28:43,637 --> 03:28:46,078
[SPEAKER_42]: That's just inviting the same thing to happen 20 years later.

2198
03:28:48,914 --> 03:28:59,172
[SPEAKER_42]: In cases like that, we allow a material like azek, which is a type of vinyl material that really looks like painted wood.

2199
03:28:59,392 --> 03:29:00,855
[SPEAKER_42]: In fact, when I

2200
03:29:02,829 --> 03:29:06,433
[SPEAKER_42]: was redoing the window sills in my own house.

2201
03:29:06,513 --> 03:29:13,580
[SPEAKER_42]: My contractor, even without asking me, put in ASEC window sills because he said, you would be completely crazy not to do that.

2202
03:29:14,221 --> 03:29:20,908
[SPEAKER_42]: So in cases where there's moisture or concerns like that, yes, we allow synthetic materials.

2203
03:29:22,000 --> 03:29:31,126
[SPEAKER_21]: And for those who have not seen Chris zoom in to a public meeting, Chris lives in a historic home where people of my height may occasionally knock their heads on a doorframe.

2204
03:29:31,586 --> 03:29:33,227
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, it's very true.

2205
03:29:33,247 --> 03:29:34,468
[SPEAKER_42]: These houses, 298 High Street was built in 1685.

2206
03:29:34,508 --> 03:29:37,530
[SPEAKER_42]: And yeah, the ceilings are beautiful.

2207
03:29:44,614 --> 03:29:51,941
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, George Washington did not choose to cite his headquarters in that home.

2208
03:29:53,503 --> 03:29:55,965
[SPEAKER_21]: A joke for me and Larry and Chris.

2209
03:29:56,145 --> 03:29:57,246
[SPEAKER_21]: Council, any more questions?

2210
03:29:58,067 --> 03:29:58,828
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

2211
03:30:00,569 --> 03:30:02,091
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you so much for being here tonight.

2212
03:30:02,771 --> 03:30:08,297
[SPEAKER_29]: I know this project has been a long time in the works, and I appreciate your overview and presentation about it.

2213
03:30:10,839 --> 03:30:20,892
[SPEAKER_29]: I have a general understanding about what historic designation, what implication that has and doesn't have for how those properties might be affected.

2214
03:30:20,952 --> 03:30:24,697
[SPEAKER_29]: You've spoken a little bit about how it's not an absolute prohibition on any particular material.

2215
03:30:25,509 --> 03:30:32,114
[SPEAKER_29]: working with developers so that I know renovations still happen under historic designation, EDUs can still happen.

2216
03:30:32,134 --> 03:30:33,055
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2217
03:30:34,016 --> 03:30:47,606
[SPEAKER_29]: Because so much of, well, speaking for myself as one councilor, because a large part of the council's goals this term are to consider proposals that do allow us to look at tools that

2218
03:30:48,621 --> 03:30:50,403
[SPEAKER_29]: enable different neighborhoods to evolve.

2219
03:30:51,043 --> 03:30:58,250
[SPEAKER_29]: I am, I have a healthy skepticism around tools that might make it more difficult for developers to

2220
03:31:01,491 --> 03:31:13,998
[SPEAKER_29]: do things like, I understand there's no prohibition on adding height, on affecting footprint, but I have some concerns around adding rules that will make it less likely for developers to do so.

2221
03:31:14,458 --> 03:31:24,363
[SPEAKER_29]: Have you noticed in historic districts already in place in Medford, is there indeed a lag with developers or owners taking advantage of things that are still technically available to them?

2222
03:31:24,383 --> 03:31:24,703
[SPEAKER_42]: Not at all.

2223
03:31:24,723 --> 03:31:27,925
[SPEAKER_42]: I can cite two specific examples where

2224
03:31:31,630 --> 03:31:35,218
[SPEAKER_42]: said seven house in Hillside, they expanded this.

2225
03:31:35,339 --> 03:31:35,880
[SPEAKER_42]: So, yeah.

2226
03:31:40,925 --> 03:31:53,030
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, yes, so I can refer specifically to two houses where we've worked with the developers to expand the footprint of the house and or the height of the house.

2227
03:31:53,110 --> 03:32:03,455
[SPEAKER_42]: At 7 Hillside, we held, I think, monthly meetings over a period of, I think, four or five months, working hand in hand with the architect.

2228
03:32:04,458 --> 03:32:17,527
[SPEAKER_42]: the developers or architect to turn a very, very large house in the Hillside Historic District into an even bigger house that was being turned into multiple condominiums.

2229
03:32:18,553 --> 03:32:27,837
[SPEAKER_42]: And we had absolutely no problem with expanding the footprint of the house, with expanding the height of certain parts of the house.

2230
03:32:28,798 --> 03:32:39,442
[SPEAKER_42]: And I think he achieved his financial goals, and the city preserved a very conspicuous house in the Hillside Historic District.

2231
03:32:40,703 --> 03:32:47,846
[SPEAKER_42]: Also on High Street, an owner wanted to add to the height of the building,

2232
03:32:48,823 --> 03:32:50,044
[SPEAKER_42]: That was absolutely no problem.

2233
03:32:50,364 --> 03:32:51,084
[SPEAKER_42]: We sorry, Chris.

2234
03:32:51,104 --> 03:32:51,564
[SPEAKER_29]: It's hard to do.

2235
03:32:51,584 --> 03:32:51,985
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm sorry.

2236
03:32:53,205 --> 03:33:03,350
[SPEAKER_42]: Uh, an owner on high street wanted to, um, expand the height of the building, uh, to make the third floor a full fully functional.

2237
03:33:04,171 --> 03:33:04,231
[SPEAKER_42]: Um

2238
03:33:05,651 --> 03:33:09,473
[SPEAKER_42]: part of the house, and we had absolutely no problem with that.

2239
03:33:11,473 --> 03:33:20,637
[SPEAKER_42]: We discussed what the roof line might should look like from a historic standpoint, but the developer really had no problem with that at all.

2240
03:33:20,777 --> 03:33:25,559
[SPEAKER_42]: So we have a history of working developers, and we're committed to work with developers in the future.

2241
03:33:25,579 --> 03:33:30,220
[SPEAKER_42]: Does that answer your question?

2242
03:33:31,001 --> 03:33:31,461
[SPEAKER_29]: Appreciate that.

2243
03:33:33,201 --> 03:33:33,702
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2244
03:33:33,802 --> 03:33:34,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scrivner?

2245
03:33:36,621 --> 03:33:37,705
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for all your work, Tom.

2246
03:33:37,725 --> 03:33:38,327
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate it.

2247
03:33:38,368 --> 03:33:42,683
[SPEAKER_16]: But the questions that residents called me and they're just concerned that yes.

2248
03:33:43,069 --> 03:34:02,374
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, and I appreciate the developers and having that control, but the conversations I had with a few neighbors that here are a few homes that aren't in the historical realm, and they would need approval to change the color of their house or a window frame.

2249
03:34:02,414 --> 03:34:03,594
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what they've told me.

2250
03:34:03,634 --> 03:34:06,275
[SPEAKER_16]: So maybe we can dispel those rumors.

2251
03:34:06,695 --> 03:34:08,756
[SPEAKER_42]: First of all, the Medford statute

2252
03:34:11,062 --> 03:34:16,526
[SPEAKER_42]: that exists that we are not proposing change gives us no jurisdiction whatsoever over house color.

2253
03:34:16,806 --> 03:34:18,467
[SPEAKER_42]: You can paint your house any color you want.

2254
03:34:19,728 --> 03:34:22,290
[SPEAKER_42]: And that's often something that people are concerned about.

2255
03:34:23,731 --> 03:34:28,094
[SPEAKER_42]: As far as materials, we're not opposed to artificial materials.

2256
03:34:28,154 --> 03:34:35,118
[SPEAKER_42]: We encourage people to use traditional materials if that's practical for the developer and practical for the application.

2257
03:34:36,259 --> 03:34:43,383
[SPEAKER_42]: but we allow artificial materials where that is simply from a contractor standpoint really necessary.

2258
03:34:43,643 --> 03:34:49,907
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so that's, with developers, listen, I support this and I understand what you're saying.

2259
03:34:49,947 --> 03:35:01,173
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that what I'm hearing is just the neighbors that are saying, what's recommended for materials if they had to make a change in their home and they're living on a fixed income.

2260
03:35:02,151 --> 03:35:07,695
[SPEAKER_16]: and how that could relate to their processes if they needed something to be remodeled.

2261
03:35:07,715 --> 03:35:11,417
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's the biggest concern and where it falls in.

2262
03:35:11,558 --> 03:35:30,991
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that really hasn't been delineated for, okay, this home was built in 1974 and they want to replace some windows and the windows might not fit in the criteria that we might be looking at with the commission, but it's affordable for the family.

2263
03:35:31,531 --> 03:35:54,833
[SPEAKER_16]: sure so i think that that's my biggest concern with this i don't think that i've heard that it we've been saying that it's been recommended but if they say no what are the ramifications um well i was gonna put this on the slide but but but um we've actually never said no okay

2264
03:35:57,874 --> 03:35:59,035
[SPEAKER_16]: But how long are you going to be there?

2265
03:35:59,916 --> 03:36:01,977
[SPEAKER_42]: I've only been on the commission for 23 years.

2266
03:36:02,117 --> 03:36:02,638
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that.

2267
03:36:02,958 --> 03:36:04,619
[SPEAKER_42]: So they may have said no before me.

2268
03:36:04,759 --> 03:36:06,441
[SPEAKER_42]: Right.

2269
03:36:06,581 --> 03:36:11,785
[SPEAKER_42]: And part of that, of course, is that people know, you know, not to ask for certain things.

2270
03:36:12,505 --> 03:36:14,127
[SPEAKER_42]: But we work with people.

2271
03:36:14,887 --> 03:36:17,169
[SPEAKER_42]: And we have literally never said no to anyone.

2272
03:36:17,987 --> 03:36:18,608
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate that.

2273
03:36:18,628 --> 03:36:32,658
[SPEAKER_16]: I like I said, I think that what you're doing and what we're doing that in that neighborhood for years, I mean, and I know that, you know, for my friend sharing music, who is a strong proponent and former former school commember with myself and

2274
03:36:33,459 --> 03:36:34,780
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, I know the passion she had.

2275
03:36:34,840 --> 03:36:39,503
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not like I said, it's not, this isn't something that I would talk against because of that.

2276
03:36:39,523 --> 03:36:45,166
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think that the biggest piece is that everyone has the neighbors that are concerned that many people have.

2277
03:36:45,246 --> 03:36:50,990
[SPEAKER_42]: And I said, totally, it's absolutely completely legitimate concern that we address every month.

2278
03:36:52,725 --> 03:36:55,646
[SPEAKER_42]: By the way, let me just say one thing about our frequency of meeting.

2279
03:36:56,127 --> 03:36:58,468
[SPEAKER_42]: We want to be the rocket docket on these things.

2280
03:36:58,508 --> 03:37:06,391
[SPEAKER_42]: We don't want to be, you know, hold up some kind of, we know that people can't get their building permit until we give them the certificate of appropriateness.

2281
03:37:06,751 --> 03:37:12,094
[SPEAKER_42]: If they want to start, you know, construction next week, we hold a meeting.

2282
03:37:13,799 --> 03:37:23,303
[SPEAKER_42]: and we've done that many, we've done that, I mean, we're all volunteers, we prefer not to do that, but yeah, if somebody wants to start work next week, we will hold a meeting right before that.

2283
03:37:24,063 --> 03:37:26,984
[SPEAKER_16]: And I appreciate you and I appreciate who's here right now.

2284
03:37:27,424 --> 03:37:31,266
[SPEAKER_16]: My fear is if we're putting the disordinates in, it's the next group that comes in.

2285
03:37:31,326 --> 03:37:34,747
[SPEAKER_16]: If they come in and they have a hard line and they're like, no, we're not gonna do it.

2286
03:37:34,787 --> 03:37:36,928
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you get to control who.

2287
03:37:37,088 --> 03:37:38,589
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, right.

2288
03:37:38,669 --> 03:37:40,129
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, no, we don't.

2289
03:37:44,568 --> 03:37:45,530
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

2290
03:37:45,771 --> 03:37:46,633
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins?

2291
03:37:47,014 --> 03:37:47,796
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, President Burris.

2292
03:37:52,105 --> 03:37:52,887
[SPEAKER_29]: Sorry, it's getting late.

2293
03:37:53,108 --> 03:37:53,809
[SPEAKER_29]: Brain's slowing down.

2294
03:37:56,042 --> 03:38:04,307
[SPEAKER_29]: Really appreciate this discussion really appreciate this kind of formal introduction to the issue though of course we've heard glimmers of it before when this was still in process.

2295
03:38:05,668 --> 03:38:17,334
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that, at least for me as one counselor I think this is a topic that you know of course there's already historic designation along South Street already, but this does mark a significant expansion in that footprint.

2296
03:38:17,854 --> 03:38:27,244
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think, you know, to echo some of what Councilor Scarpelli just said, I think that it seems very clear to me that for every concern or question we have, there's a ready answer.

2297
03:38:28,685 --> 03:38:38,576
[SPEAKER_29]: That being, notwithstanding that being the case, you know, it's pretty rare for us to take a first vote on an ordinance when it's first introduced before the Council, and I think

2298
03:38:39,332 --> 03:38:55,103
[SPEAKER_29]: know, in the role that we inhabit on the City Council, especially with something as longstanding as an ordinance, we can feel incredible about how a current Board of Commissioners takes up their mission and implements it, and certainly I feel great about the work that

2299
03:38:55,763 --> 03:38:59,126
[SPEAKER_29]: you all do and how you've been doing and how you've been collaborating with community members and developers.

2300
03:38:59,727 --> 03:39:06,093
[SPEAKER_29]: But this is something that marks a big enough change that I'd like to give it a bit more conversation and deliberation before we take votes on it.

2301
03:39:06,473 --> 03:39:17,023
[SPEAKER_29]: So I would make the motion to perhaps refer into the planning and permitting committee where we take up other building related topics for more of a discussion.

2302
03:39:18,824 --> 03:39:26,232
[SPEAKER_29]: to go over the details of the questions raised by councillors before we move forward, unless there's an alternative proposal raised by my fellow councillors.

2303
03:39:26,732 --> 03:39:30,816
[SPEAKER_42]: We're glad to meet with you in any format whatsoever.

2304
03:39:32,838 --> 03:39:37,063
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, we're glad to meet with you in any format whatsoever, whatever works for you guys.

2305
03:39:42,173 --> 03:39:42,894
[SPEAKER_20]: Any further discussion?

2306
03:39:42,914 --> 03:39:45,837
[SPEAKER_50]: If I could just add one thing about this.

2307
03:39:46,057 --> 03:39:47,559
[SPEAKER_50]: We've been at this for two years.

2308
03:39:48,780 --> 03:39:57,309
[SPEAKER_50]: And I'd like to add that we are following an ordinance laid out by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for establishing local historic districts.

2309
03:39:58,150 --> 03:40:00,832
[SPEAKER_50]: And there are 12 steps involved in that.

2310
03:40:01,957 --> 03:40:02,678
[SPEAKER_50]: You don't have to.

2311
03:40:03,078 --> 03:40:04,059
[SPEAKER_50]: You're the ninth step.

2312
03:40:04,199 --> 03:40:05,360
[SPEAKER_50]: So we've gone ninth.

2313
03:40:05,400 --> 03:40:09,164
[SPEAKER_50]: We still have two more to go before it's an official ordinance.

2314
03:40:09,864 --> 03:40:15,009
[SPEAKER_50]: But the Commonwealth has laid out a very specific and a very detailed method.

2315
03:40:15,750 --> 03:40:21,335
[SPEAKER_50]: So that's why it takes a long time to get these districts in place, in order.

2316
03:40:22,716 --> 03:40:24,378
[SPEAKER_50]: And we've sort of

2317
03:40:25,780 --> 03:40:29,763
[SPEAKER_50]: this district because of the quality homes all pre 18 60 18 50.

2318
03:40:30,964 --> 03:40:33,385
[SPEAKER_50]: Most of them a couple exceptions to that.

2319
03:40:34,166 --> 03:40:36,847
[SPEAKER_50]: But the districts they need to be continuous boundaries.

2320
03:40:36,907 --> 03:40:46,294
[SPEAKER_50]: They need to have significance that needs to be approved by the Mass historical commission and things, so I'm just putting that out there that it's been a deliberative process.

2321
03:40:46,914 --> 03:40:52,518
[SPEAKER_50]: We've tried to follow those steps every step of the way, getting all the signatures and the sign offs and everything.

2322
03:40:52,558 --> 03:40:52,658
[SPEAKER_50]: So

2323
03:40:53,444 --> 03:40:55,606
[SPEAKER_50]: your one step, we're still on the journey.

2324
03:40:55,646 --> 03:40:57,267
[SPEAKER_50]: So I appreciate your help with that.

2325
03:40:59,328 --> 03:41:05,292
[SPEAKER_18]: Any other comments, councilor saying, um, I just wanted to thank you for your patience tonight and for coming here.

2326
03:41:05,372 --> 03:41:10,636
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, with so much, so many materials for us to review before the meeting and to look at during the meeting as well.

2327
03:41:10,676 --> 03:41:18,702
[SPEAKER_18]: And for being so prepared for our questions, um, I don't look for at all, um, five minute walk at most, if not three minute walk,

2328
03:41:19,702 --> 03:41:31,390
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm quite excited about this because I've always believed that our history in Medford is something that makes us unique and makes us stand out as a city even in such a historic area.

2329
03:41:31,410 --> 03:41:39,956
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Medford's history is so rich and to be able to protect it in the physical manner I think is so important.

2330
03:41:41,096 --> 03:41:42,838
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm happy to support.

2331
03:41:43,198 --> 03:41:47,461
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand that there are concerns to talk through and I would

2332
03:41:48,121 --> 03:41:48,941
[SPEAKER_18]: respect that as well.

2333
03:41:49,421 --> 03:41:51,222
[SPEAKER_18]: But I wanted to thank you for your work.

2334
03:41:51,742 --> 03:42:01,104
[SPEAKER_42]: Well, and I want to thank, I want to thank Fred and Joe for what they've done and Charlotte Scuderi was here before she got tired and went home.

2335
03:42:02,364 --> 03:42:03,044
[SPEAKER_42]: A lot of people.

2336
03:42:03,224 --> 03:42:09,846
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, and one of the people, one of the folks who's retiring this evening, Janice,

2337
03:42:10,679 --> 03:42:18,120
[SPEAKER_42]: has actually been very helpful to the historic district commission over the years and I want to congratulate her on that.

2338
03:42:21,651 --> 03:42:38,450
[SPEAKER_42]: on her retirement and thank her for help getting us through this whole process of voting the Historic District Commission, submission of preliminary report, approval by the Mass Historical Commission, public hearings, approval by the County Development Board, and so on.

2339
03:42:38,630 --> 03:42:39,571
[SPEAKER_42]: I'd also like to thank

2340
03:42:41,173 --> 03:42:52,422
[SPEAKER_42]: Sylvia for, I believe it was Sylvia who may have sworn me in 23 years ago as a member of the Historic District Commission.

2341
03:42:52,442 --> 03:42:53,743
[SPEAKER_42]: So congratulations to you.

2342
03:42:55,764 --> 03:42:56,084
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2343
03:42:56,124 --> 03:42:57,526
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further comments from members of the Council?

2344
03:42:59,169 --> 03:43:14,081
[SPEAKER_21]: I for one, South Street is just one of our most beautiful historic neighborhoods and I've been in the 21 Toro house and I remember the deep concerns with grandfather's house and yeah I mean this is one that just makes sense to me out of the gate.

2345
03:43:14,201 --> 03:43:16,263
[SPEAKER_21]: I know a couple years ago we were talking about

2346
03:43:16,840 --> 03:43:20,401
[SPEAKER_21]: the one parcel on foster court and I voted for it, didn't pass.

2347
03:43:21,501 --> 03:43:22,962
[SPEAKER_21]: But this is contiguous.

2348
03:43:23,202 --> 03:43:26,222
[SPEAKER_21]: It's so well evidenced, deeply supported.

2349
03:43:26,302 --> 03:43:27,583
[SPEAKER_21]: The process has been so long.

2350
03:43:28,083 --> 03:43:32,024
[SPEAKER_21]: I personally would be a strong proponent of approving it for first reading tonight myself.

2351
03:43:32,164 --> 03:43:35,485
[SPEAKER_21]: But, you know, I just think this is

2352
03:43:36,650 --> 03:43:42,778
[SPEAKER_21]: This is exactly the place we need to go and I mean we see the pit right now on on South Street, next to that 5054.

2353
03:43:43,739 --> 03:43:44,741
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2354
03:43:45,402 --> 03:43:48,125
[SPEAKER_21]: And you know, again, I'm a huge proponent of building more housing.

2355
03:43:50,268 --> 03:43:53,272
[SPEAKER_21]: But, and I think you brought up the grandfather's house case as well.

2356
03:43:54,218 --> 03:43:59,921
[SPEAKER_21]: a little bit of a difference in outward appearance would have made a huge difference in the impact of that new construction on that property.

2357
03:43:59,941 --> 03:44:20,591
[SPEAKER_21]: 54 has already gone through, so that as well will not have, but I mean, I think they made some decent considerations and historical commission has had some leverage with the preferably preserved, but this is a neighborhood where, you know, I don't think we got enough necessarily and a neighborhood that really needs it because it is just a major historic quarter with some historic buildings that still have

2358
03:44:21,653 --> 03:44:29,756
[SPEAKER_21]: have not been switched to vinyl siding and have not had their main features and historic features just completely stripped and ripped away.

2359
03:44:30,356 --> 03:44:38,599
[SPEAKER_21]: So I really see this neighborhood as 100% and this district specifically as constructed as a place to move ahead personally.

2360
03:44:38,659 --> 03:44:39,779
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you for your work on it.

2361
03:44:40,859 --> 03:44:45,761
[SPEAKER_42]: Vice President Collins, are there any specific concerns that I could address this evening?

2362
03:44:48,762 --> 03:44:49,843
[SPEAKER_29]: If I'm being totally candid,

2363
03:44:51,981 --> 03:44:56,664
[SPEAKER_42]: So are there any specific concerns that you have right now that I could address?

2364
03:44:57,565 --> 03:45:07,090
[SPEAKER_29]: If I'm being candid, part of the reason for my desire to have more of this discussion in a separate meeting is because we have five or six major financial papers to take up after this, and I don't want to have that conversation right now.

2365
03:45:07,290 --> 03:45:12,934
[SPEAKER_29]: That said, if there's another motion to approve it outright, we just take the votes, and I wouldn't take that personally.

2366
03:45:14,841 --> 03:45:17,181
[SPEAKER_21]: Currently, any further comments from members of the council?

2367
03:45:17,201 --> 03:45:21,262
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a motion on the floor from Vice President Collins to refer to planning and permitting.

2368
03:45:22,242 --> 03:45:23,303
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there a second on that motion?

2369
03:45:24,463 --> 03:45:25,663
[SPEAKER_21]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2370
03:45:27,383 --> 03:45:29,404
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there any comments by members of the public on this item?

2371
03:45:29,924 --> 03:45:33,065
[SPEAKER_21]: Raise your hands on Zoom or come to the podium and share.

2372
03:45:33,145 --> 03:45:35,645
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm gonna go first to the podium.

2373
03:45:35,725 --> 03:45:37,225
[SPEAKER_21]: Name and address for the record, please.

2374
03:45:38,026 --> 03:45:39,646
[SPEAKER_21]: And you'll have three minutes.

2375
03:45:40,305 --> 03:45:43,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Scott Kenworthy, 23 South Street, Medford.

2376
03:45:44,727 --> 03:45:57,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just here tonight to say that we really don't need government on our property doing anything more to our property than we already have to deal with.

2377
03:45:58,113 --> 03:46:02,055
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why I say that is I've worked with Chris in the past.

2378
03:46:02,075 --> 03:46:03,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I've worked with a historic commission.

2379
03:46:04,195 --> 03:46:07,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the only guy that's given my financials to the ZBA.

2380
03:46:08,385 --> 03:46:14,269
[SPEAKER_03]: on projects as to what my bottom line is, so they could be totally transparent and they could see what I was doing.

2381
03:46:15,009 --> 03:46:18,951
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm retired now, so I don't have any skin in the game here at all.

2382
03:46:19,492 --> 03:46:31,339
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can tell you that, or any of you through the chair, are familiar with the Secretary of Interior's website, because I've been through 10 years of historic commission meetings.

2383
03:46:32,435 --> 03:46:36,957
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can tell you that Chris is a great guy.

2384
03:46:36,977 --> 03:46:38,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I love working with Chris.

2385
03:46:39,458 --> 03:46:43,039
[SPEAKER_03]: But Chris mentioned a few things that I have to correct.

2386
03:46:43,639 --> 03:46:46,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And what he was saying was correct as far as he's concerned.

2387
03:46:47,140 --> 03:46:53,783
[SPEAKER_03]: But when the historic commission comes in, they're not going to allow me to raise my roof if I wanted to raise my roof.

2388
03:46:53,883 --> 03:46:57,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they like this certain pitch, and they want to just keep it that way.

2389
03:46:57,504 --> 03:46:58,305
[SPEAKER_03]: So that part of it.

2390
03:47:00,390 --> 03:47:02,671
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to deal with the historic commission on that.

2391
03:47:03,611 --> 03:47:18,915
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is, it's very divisive when you deal with people in neighborhoods, and you want to say to some people, you know, it's almost like having a wedding, and only having chicken, people go, where's the fish, you know, don't you have chicken and fish.

2392
03:47:21,300 --> 03:47:26,664
[SPEAKER_03]: in this neighborhood wants to go and be historic with their house, they can go ahead and do that.

2393
03:47:27,305 --> 03:47:32,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And the historic district commission can also have a part in that.

2394
03:47:32,869 --> 03:47:35,671
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's people who want to abstain from that.

2395
03:47:35,771 --> 03:47:37,412
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to opt out.

2396
03:47:38,113 --> 03:47:39,554
[SPEAKER_03]: So we should be able to opt out.

2397
03:47:41,126 --> 03:47:46,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I did own quite a few houses on South Street, and in that neighborhood, maybe eight or 10 houses.

2398
03:47:47,687 --> 03:47:50,648
[SPEAKER_03]: And we put millions of dollars into those properties.

2399
03:47:51,428 --> 03:47:59,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've had some meetings where I think that I may know better than some of the people that I was dealing with.

2400
03:47:59,849 --> 03:48:07,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's got to be a trust factor there that some people, you've got to give them the responsibility and let them do what they want to do with their property.

2401
03:48:09,952 --> 03:48:21,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I will always work with these guys and historic commission, historic district commission, but to impose this on us is unnecessary, totally unnecessary.

2402
03:48:22,901 --> 03:48:27,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And also it kind of, it also leaves things open to corruption.

2403
03:48:28,264 --> 03:48:32,687
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't think this corruption in Medford, I'm just going to drop a ball right here.

2404
03:48:33,588 --> 03:48:34,368
[SPEAKER_03]: I've lived it.

2405
03:48:34,708 --> 03:48:36,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a major heart attack, 2019 that was,

2406
03:48:39,738 --> 03:48:44,382
[SPEAKER_03]: precipitated by Paul Moki and the way he ran your building department for 30 years.

2407
03:48:44,522 --> 03:48:45,503
[SPEAKER_21]: You have about 30 seconds.

2408
03:48:45,683 --> 03:48:51,588
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the bottom line is, I'm here because I don't want people to go through what I've been through.

2409
03:48:52,168 --> 03:48:57,733
[SPEAKER_03]: And every time a rule is made in this town, believe me, it is done as a tollgate.

2410
03:48:58,393 --> 03:49:01,796
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's people in here that are getting passes, and there's other people that aren't.

2411
03:49:02,156 --> 03:49:03,517
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's violating our rights.

2412
03:49:04,198 --> 03:49:07,421
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm against anything that's gonna restrict

2413
03:49:08,783 --> 03:49:10,506
[SPEAKER_03]: people and our properties down there.

2414
03:49:10,546 --> 03:49:11,588
[SPEAKER_03]: We own the properties.

2415
03:49:11,749 --> 03:49:13,753
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to trust that we're going to do the right thing.

2416
03:49:14,824 --> 03:49:23,910
[SPEAKER_03]: The gentleman that just dug that big hole, I sold him 109 Forest Street because I had to get out of town back then because of all the corruption that was going on here.

2417
03:49:24,731 --> 03:49:27,672
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamal will do a fantastic job.

2418
03:49:27,732 --> 03:49:29,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Go by 109 Forest Street.

2419
03:49:29,374 --> 03:49:30,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a look at the garage he built.

2420
03:49:31,235 --> 03:49:33,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a look at the townhouse he built there.

2421
03:49:33,536 --> 03:49:35,998
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no problem with what he's doing on South Street.

2422
03:49:36,438 --> 03:49:39,660
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll stake everything I've worked for on that.

2423
03:49:40,081 --> 03:49:41,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to trust people.

2424
03:49:41,662 --> 03:49:42,742
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate your comment.

2425
03:49:42,782 --> 03:49:43,143
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2426
03:49:44,147 --> 03:49:46,894
[SPEAKER_21]: I have another comment from Deborah Beard Bader.

2427
03:49:46,914 --> 03:49:48,478
[SPEAKER_21]: Damon, address for the record, please.

2428
03:49:48,498 --> 03:49:49,179
[SPEAKER_21]: You have three minutes.

2429
03:49:50,518 --> 03:49:52,159
[SPEAKER_49]: My name is Deborah Beard Bader.

2430
03:49:52,199 --> 03:49:54,141
[SPEAKER_49]: I'm actually Christopher's wife.

2431
03:49:54,961 --> 03:49:58,485
[SPEAKER_49]: And we both lived in Medford for four years.

2432
03:49:58,625 --> 03:50:04,050
[SPEAKER_49]: I've recently retired and moved up to Southern New Hampshire so I can have chickens and all that.

2433
03:50:04,450 --> 03:50:09,454
[SPEAKER_49]: But we lived at High Street for 23 years, I believe, on High Street.

2434
03:50:09,975 --> 03:50:15,019
[SPEAKER_49]: And I've owned two, over the course of my life, historic homes in Medford.

2435
03:50:15,740 --> 03:50:22,324
[SPEAKER_49]: And one of the great things about Medford is historic homes, and not enough cities have that resource.

2436
03:50:23,285 --> 03:50:28,628
[SPEAKER_49]: And I totally disagree with the prior speaker that we want to have everything laissez-faire.

2437
03:50:29,189 --> 03:50:32,030
[SPEAKER_49]: We'll end up like Somerville or someplace like that.

2438
03:50:32,411 --> 03:50:36,653
[SPEAKER_49]: You cannot protect historic homes enough.

2439
03:50:36,853 --> 03:50:41,897
[SPEAKER_49]: It's a resource not just for the individual owner, but it belongs to the community as a whole.

2440
03:50:42,537 --> 03:50:45,458
[SPEAKER_49]: This is not the first historic district in Medford.

2441
03:50:45,838 --> 03:50:47,118
[SPEAKER_49]: There are several others.

2442
03:50:47,298 --> 03:50:50,479
[SPEAKER_49]: It's now been a two-year review process.

2443
03:50:50,979 --> 03:50:58,741
[SPEAKER_49]: And I will complain as the wife of the man who went to all of these meetings for two years, that an extensive amount of work has gone into this.

2444
03:50:59,181 --> 03:51:01,021
[SPEAKER_49]: There has been meetings with the Butters.

2445
03:51:01,362 --> 03:51:02,762
[SPEAKER_49]: There's been meetings with neighbors.

2446
03:51:03,342 --> 03:51:06,063
[SPEAKER_49]: All of the conversations have been positive.

2447
03:51:06,143 --> 03:51:07,283
[SPEAKER_49]: People have supported this.

2448
03:51:07,703 --> 03:51:11,364
[SPEAKER_49]: And now it is before the board, is in front of the city council,

2449
03:51:11,764 --> 03:51:12,846
[SPEAKER_49]: to make this decision.

2450
03:51:14,508 --> 03:51:19,555
[SPEAKER_49]: We have these commissions so that they can study these questions, talk to the

2451
03:51:20,518 --> 03:51:23,340
[SPEAKER_49]: the stakeholders and see how they feel about it.

2452
03:51:23,620 --> 03:51:26,002
[SPEAKER_49]: The stakeholders are fine with this process.

2453
03:51:26,102 --> 03:51:27,263
[SPEAKER_49]: It has worked very well.

2454
03:51:27,603 --> 03:51:43,375
[SPEAKER_49]: And to continue to delay this because one, perhaps one board member or city councilor wants to perhaps study it longer when we've had the material under advisement and had the community discussions for two years

2455
03:51:44,476 --> 03:51:50,121
[SPEAKER_49]: strikes me as crazy because the problem we have is this is not an infinite amount of time.

2456
03:51:50,601 --> 03:52:02,111
[SPEAKER_49]: We have had problems in that area and other parts of Medford that should also probably be considered for historic districts as well because this is a finite resource that is under fire every day.

2457
03:52:02,571 --> 03:52:09,237
[SPEAKER_49]: Time goes by and we lose old houses on the regular in Medford and it's a tragedy and it's not something you can get back.

2458
03:52:10,700 --> 03:52:12,203
[SPEAKER_49]: And this is a great project.

2459
03:52:12,223 --> 03:52:13,124
[SPEAKER_49]: It's a great area.

2460
03:52:13,184 --> 03:52:18,232
[SPEAKER_49]: Too many people work too hard to just sit around and say, gee, I just want to think about it a little bit longer.

2461
03:52:18,593 --> 03:52:20,516
[SPEAKER_49]: There have been many hearings on this.

2462
03:52:20,536 --> 03:52:21,758
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you.

2463
03:52:21,878 --> 03:52:22,739
[SPEAKER_21]: You have 30 seconds.

2464
03:52:23,422 --> 03:52:31,589
[SPEAKER_49]: For two years, I think the time to have any further debate on whether there should be a public role in private housing is over.

2465
03:52:31,689 --> 03:52:37,974
[SPEAKER_49]: We know what that role is and we have the legislation for it and it's working well in all the other historic districts.

2466
03:52:38,375 --> 03:52:41,297
[SPEAKER_49]: This is just one small new district.

2467
03:52:42,298 --> 03:52:43,079
[SPEAKER_49]: That's all I have to say.

2468
03:52:44,000 --> 03:52:44,580
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2469
03:52:45,841 --> 03:52:47,483
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further comment from members of the public?

2470
03:52:48,483 --> 03:52:49,765
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing none, I'll go to Councilor Leming.

2471
03:52:50,862 --> 03:52:54,544
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have one question for the members of the Historic District Commission.

2472
03:52:54,844 --> 03:53:03,410
[SPEAKER_11]: When you were deciding which district to choose for those, what other areas were you sort of considering?

2473
03:53:03,490 --> 03:53:08,673
[SPEAKER_11]: And can you just delve a little bit more into the specific rationale for choosing South Street?

2474
03:53:09,894 --> 03:53:12,756
[SPEAKER_42]: Well, there are Victorian houses all over Medford.

2475
03:53:13,570 --> 03:53:20,594
[SPEAKER_42]: And if we went for the Victorian houses, we would be talking about thousands of houses in Medford.

2476
03:53:22,314 --> 03:53:27,737
[SPEAKER_42]: We specifically, the number of pre-Civil War houses is much, much smaller.

2477
03:53:28,698 --> 03:53:34,881
[SPEAKER_42]: These are the pre-Civil War houses and they're grouped together in a way that is integral to the history of Medford.

2478
03:53:35,441 --> 03:53:37,902
[SPEAKER_42]: And that is why we focused on South Street.

2479
03:53:39,543 --> 03:53:40,284
[SPEAKER_42]: Is that your question?

2480
03:53:42,375 --> 03:53:52,401
[SPEAKER_50]: I'll just mention that it's directly related to the shipbuilding history of Clippership City, and these have direct connections to that logo on our building.

2481
03:53:52,761 --> 03:54:00,505
[SPEAKER_50]: That's why specifically South Street and these ones that are pre-Civil War, 1850, 1830, are important to the city.

2482
03:54:04,387 --> 03:54:04,748
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2483
03:54:05,728 --> 03:54:07,629
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further discussion by members of the Council or the public?

2484
03:54:07,989 --> 03:54:08,710
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lozano.

2485
03:54:10,044 --> 03:54:10,965
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion to approve.

2486
03:54:11,586 --> 03:54:15,590
[SPEAKER_37]: I know Councilor Collins has a motion to send it to committee.

2487
03:54:20,194 --> 03:54:21,896
[SPEAKER_37]: So I'm not sure if I can motion to.

2488
03:54:21,976 --> 03:54:23,157
[SPEAKER_21]: We do have a motion on the floor.

2489
03:54:23,177 --> 03:54:24,658
[SPEAKER_21]: We can't have a motion.

2490
03:54:24,758 --> 03:54:27,360
[SPEAKER_21]: So we would have to vote that motion or without that motion.

2491
03:54:28,581 --> 03:54:29,702
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is an ordinance.

2492
03:54:29,742 --> 03:54:30,683
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll just read it really quickly.

2493
03:54:30,703 --> 03:54:44,135
[SPEAKER_21]: This would amend sections 4851 and 4852 of the municipal code to include the words fixes what adds to the list and a South Street historic district.

2494
03:54:44,958 --> 03:55:11,527
[SPEAKER_21]: twice in section 4851 and once in section 4852, and it also would set forth that the South Street Historic District is and shall hereby be created with the boundaries of the said South Street Historic District being as shown on the map entitled South Street Historic District prepared by the City of Medford Historic District Commission dated November 9th, 2023, a copy of which is on file with the city clerk and is to be recorded at the Middlesex South District Registry of Deeds.

2495
03:55:11,587 --> 03:55:12,248
[SPEAKER_21]: So that is the vote.

2496
03:55:13,905 --> 03:55:15,265
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Zara, do you have a further comment?

2497
03:55:15,685 --> 03:55:27,808
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, my reasoning behind my motion to carry this forward as written is that, sorry, I don't know why there's so much feedback when I use my microphone.

2498
03:55:27,848 --> 03:55:34,489
[SPEAKER_21]: If you turn your microphone, if these front two microphones are technically in front of the speakers, and I think the speakers are very loud tonight.

2499
03:55:35,829 --> 03:55:36,630
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just where I'm sitting.

2500
03:55:37,290 --> 03:55:37,850
[SPEAKER_37]: It'll just have to...

2501
03:55:38,609 --> 03:55:38,829
[SPEAKER_37]: bring.

2502
03:55:39,850 --> 03:55:50,235
[SPEAKER_37]: The reasoning behind this is that it is part of a, seems like a pretty comprehensive process.

2503
03:55:50,255 --> 03:56:07,644
[SPEAKER_37]: The planning and permitting committee has so much going on with the zoning right now that this feels like it's, we don't have, I don't think we have the capacity to go over it in planning and permitting with any kind of speed or

2504
03:56:09,477 --> 03:56:10,698
[SPEAKER_37]: in any kind of timely manner.

2505
03:56:10,918 --> 03:56:12,900
[SPEAKER_37]: So that's my thinking, just to explain.

2506
03:56:16,062 --> 03:56:16,883
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Lozano.

2507
03:56:16,903 --> 03:56:22,227
[SPEAKER_21]: We have the motion of Councilor Collins to refer to planning and permitting, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2508
03:56:22,247 --> 03:56:24,248
[SPEAKER_21]: Does that motion stand?

2509
03:56:24,929 --> 03:56:25,629
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion stands.

2510
03:56:26,690 --> 03:56:28,011
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

2511
03:56:34,636 --> 03:56:35,717
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Callahan.

2512
03:56:36,138 --> 03:56:36,178
[SPEAKER_39]: No.

2513
03:56:39,208 --> 03:56:39,488
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

2514
03:56:39,549 --> 03:56:39,989
[SPEAKER_39]: No.

2515
03:56:40,189 --> 03:56:40,449
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

2516
03:56:40,469 --> 03:56:40,509
[SPEAKER_34]: No.

2517
03:56:42,030 --> 03:56:46,374
[SPEAKER_39]: No for the negative three in the affirmative.

2518
03:56:46,394 --> 03:56:53,079
[SPEAKER_39]: The motion fails.

2519
03:56:53,159 --> 03:56:59,684
[SPEAKER_39]: Is there another motion on the floor?

2520
03:57:06,806 --> 03:57:09,448
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, how do I, what, it's not motion to present.

2521
03:57:09,468 --> 03:57:10,888
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a motion to approve for first reading.

2522
03:57:11,008 --> 03:57:11,809
[SPEAKER_37]: Approve for first reading.

2523
03:57:12,209 --> 03:57:18,473
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion to approve the ordinance creating a South Street Historic District for first reading by Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by?

2524
03:57:18,493 --> 03:57:19,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

2525
03:57:20,734 --> 03:57:22,015
[SPEAKER_21]: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

2526
03:57:22,215 --> 03:57:23,275
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

2527
03:57:26,798 --> 03:57:26,998
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2528
03:57:29,159 --> 03:57:30,260
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no, no, no, no, no, sorry.

2529
03:57:30,300 --> 03:57:30,920
[SPEAKER_21]: This is still 4-2-1.

2530
03:57:31,060 --> 03:57:34,222
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we just, yes.

2531
03:57:37,608 --> 03:57:37,808
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

2532
03:57:37,888 --> 03:57:38,209
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

2533
03:57:38,269 --> 03:57:38,589
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

2534
03:57:39,089 --> 03:57:39,350
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

2535
03:58:00,809 --> 03:58:02,751
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

2536
03:58:03,311 --> 03:58:05,373
[SPEAKER_21]: The motion passes to approve for first reading.

2537
03:58:05,433 --> 03:58:19,123
[SPEAKER_21]: It meets the two-thirds threshold, and it will go on the, it'll be advertised for second reading in the Medford Transcript and Somerville Journal, and then we will come back before this body for a third reading once that advertising period is complete.

2538
03:58:19,483 --> 03:58:23,006
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so much.

2539
03:58:23,026 --> 03:58:24,527
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2540
03:58:24,547 --> 03:58:27,789
[SPEAKER_21]: 24-425, Community Preservation Committee appropriation request.

2541
03:58:28,874 --> 03:58:36,780
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me get my papers in order and we can, oh Lord.

2542
03:58:36,800 --> 03:58:48,149
[SPEAKER_21]: Give me a minute here.

2543
03:58:48,569 --> 03:58:49,650
[SPEAKER_39]: Take your time.

2544
03:58:50,431 --> 03:58:51,372
[SPEAKER_21]: I really wish I wasn't.

2545
03:58:57,933 --> 03:58:59,635
[SPEAKER_21]: I just need to pull it up online.

2546
03:58:59,655 --> 03:59:07,846
[SPEAKER_21]: I do have paper copies of the- I thought I did too, but somehow in my unstapling and random sorting, I've lost it.

2547
03:59:07,866 --> 03:59:12,372
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, here we go.

2548
03:59:15,230 --> 03:59:19,834
[SPEAKER_21]: Paper 24-425, Community Preservation Committee Appropriation Request.

2549
03:59:20,394 --> 03:59:29,783
[SPEAKER_21]: Dear President Bears and members of the City Council, on behalf of the Community Preservation Committee, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following recommendations of the Community Preservation Committee.

2550
03:59:30,343 --> 03:59:39,351
[SPEAKER_21]: Requesting the appropriation of $20,000 from the CPA General Reserve to Medford Public Schools for the purchase and installation of bicycle repair stations at the McGlynn, Andrews, and Medford High Schools.

2551
03:59:40,091 --> 03:59:43,054
[SPEAKER_21]: Requesting the appropriation of $5,000 from the CPA General Reserves

2552
03:59:43,493 --> 03:59:59,889
[SPEAKER_21]: to the Roberts Elementary School PTO for the purchase and installation of a basketball hoop at the Roberts Elementary School, and requesting an appropriation of $5,000 to the Medford Public Schools for the purchase and installation of a Gaga ball pit for the Medford-McGlynn Elementary School.

2553
04:00:02,486 --> 04:00:04,607
[SPEAKER_21]: I say that like I'm not a little monster.

2554
04:00:05,367 --> 04:00:08,929
[SPEAKER_21]: A gaga ball pit for the McGlynn Elementary School.

2555
04:00:08,949 --> 04:00:11,750
[SPEAKER_21]: The project will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund.

2556
04:00:12,131 --> 04:00:14,832
[SPEAKER_21]: The CPC recommendation letters are attached to the incorporation.

2557
04:00:15,372 --> 04:00:19,994
[SPEAKER_21]: Community Preservation Act manager Teresa DuPont and chairperson Roberta Cameron will be in attendance.

2558
04:00:20,975 --> 04:00:24,156
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter Cushing and Andrew O'Brien have been invited to speak.

2559
04:00:24,736 --> 04:00:26,497
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure they're not here at this point.

2560
04:00:26,537 --> 04:00:28,618
[SPEAKER_21]: They probably have something else to do.

2561
04:00:30,475 --> 04:00:35,057
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and maybe a first time we've heard a little monster in the council chamber.

2562
04:00:35,117 --> 04:00:36,858
[SPEAKER_21]: So I will go to you.

2563
04:00:36,878 --> 04:00:36,958
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2564
04:00:38,999 --> 04:00:42,341
[SPEAKER_36]: So yes.

2565
04:00:44,001 --> 04:00:44,782
[SPEAKER_19]: Manager DuPont.

2566
04:00:45,481 --> 04:00:53,566
[SPEAKER_36]: If Dr. Cushing or Principal O'Brien are on, I would encourage them to raise their hands, but I'm happy to speak on behalf of these three applications that are before you tonight.

2567
04:00:53,866 --> 04:00:58,029
[SPEAKER_36]: I will start with the bicycle infrastructure stations.

2568
04:00:58,109 --> 04:01:03,552
[SPEAKER_36]: What this will do is they already have one in hand, but they will purchase two more bicycle storage racks.

2569
04:01:04,273 --> 04:01:06,014
[SPEAKER_36]: Those will be placed at the Andrews.

2570
04:01:06,906 --> 04:01:22,123
[SPEAKER_36]: The McGlynn and Medford High, in addition to these bicycle storage racks, they will also install repair kits that will have your basic tools as well as air pumps, the air pump, valve, filler, whatever.

2571
04:01:22,723 --> 04:01:24,907
[SPEAKER_36]: It is also late and my brain is also very tired.

2572
04:01:26,208 --> 04:01:32,478
[SPEAKER_36]: The intention behind this is to help promote fossil fuel free travel and transportation to work.

2573
04:01:32,498 --> 04:01:36,704
[SPEAKER_36]: This will be available to the public after school hours.

2574
04:01:38,065 --> 04:01:42,347
[SPEAKER_36]: So this is an appropriation request in the amount of $20,000 to facilitate all of that.

2575
04:01:42,427 --> 04:01:48,730
[SPEAKER_36]: Their goal is to try and get this done before the school year for all of these projects that are in front of you.

2576
04:01:49,410 --> 04:01:55,852
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm not sure if I, I'll pause and see if there's any particular questions on the bicycle infrastructure.

2577
04:01:56,413 --> 04:01:57,993
[SPEAKER_21]: Questions on the bicycle infrastructure?

2578
04:01:59,134 --> 04:02:01,915
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing none.

2579
04:02:04,276 --> 04:02:04,496
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

2580
04:02:04,596 --> 04:02:04,736
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay.

2581
04:02:07,011 --> 04:02:09,953
[SPEAKER_26]: Nobody wants to listen to an explanation about what a gaga ball pit is.

2582
04:02:09,973 --> 04:02:12,714
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you give it in two sentences?

2583
04:02:13,354 --> 04:02:14,415
[SPEAKER_26]: I do want to know what it is.

2584
04:02:15,135 --> 04:02:21,118
[SPEAKER_36]: Dodgeball in a pit where they use the walls instead of just throwing it immediately at a person, they use the walls to bounce off.

2585
04:02:21,138 --> 04:02:23,279
[SPEAKER_36]: So it's kinder, gentler.

2586
04:02:23,299 --> 04:02:26,861
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like we need a bit more of an extensive presentation.

2587
04:02:28,482 --> 04:02:31,223
[SPEAKER_36]: Perhaps we can work on a ribbon cutting for the gaga ball pit.

2588
04:02:31,263 --> 04:02:32,124
[SPEAKER_36]: We can all come and play.

2589
04:02:32,144 --> 04:02:34,285
[SPEAKER_22]: Sounds like we're not teaching tough love.

2590
04:02:36,147 --> 04:02:37,688
[SPEAKER_22]: So maybe we need to bring that back.

2591
04:02:39,109 --> 04:02:40,470
[SPEAKER_22]: The safe dodge ball.

2592
04:02:41,170 --> 04:02:45,533
[SPEAKER_22]: If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball.

2593
04:02:45,633 --> 04:02:48,815
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just glad it's not like Lady Gaga branded and we're not paying extra for it.

2594
04:02:48,835 --> 04:02:49,736
[SPEAKER_36]: It is not Lady Gaga's ball pit.

2595
04:02:49,756 --> 04:02:49,956
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

2596
04:02:50,756 --> 04:02:52,838
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a motion of Councilor Skidmore to approve, seconded by?

2597
04:02:52,918 --> 04:02:53,258
[SPEAKER_21]: Second.

2598
04:02:53,278 --> 04:02:53,618
[SPEAKER_21]: Second.

2599
04:02:54,839 --> 04:02:55,579
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Leming.

2600
04:02:56,260 --> 04:02:57,361
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

2601
04:02:57,641 --> 04:02:57,941
[SPEAKER_21]: This is on 24425.

2602
04:02:58,021 --> 04:02:58,121
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2603
04:03:09,727 --> 04:03:10,467
[SPEAKER_19]: She's still with us.

2604
04:03:15,310 --> 04:03:16,071
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Callahan.

2605
04:03:16,091 --> 04:03:16,151
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2606
04:03:16,191 --> 04:03:16,471
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2607
04:03:20,534 --> 04:03:21,014
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, there we go.

2608
04:03:36,428 --> 04:03:39,030
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

2609
04:03:39,150 --> 04:03:39,610
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

2610
04:03:41,612 --> 04:03:49,137
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

2611
04:03:49,498 --> 04:03:51,679
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I mean, then the negative emotion passes.

2612
04:03:52,640 --> 04:03:53,881
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you on behalf of the schools.

2613
04:03:53,901 --> 04:03:54,441
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you very much.

2614
04:03:54,461 --> 04:03:54,882
[SPEAKER_36]: Appreciate it.

2615
04:03:55,042 --> 04:03:55,782
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2616
04:03:59,385 --> 04:04:01,867
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, and all my papers are a little bit out of order.

2617
04:04:26,214 --> 04:04:31,780
[SPEAKER_21]: 24427, appropriation for Medford High School MSBA feasibility study.

2618
04:04:33,241 --> 04:04:45,853
[SPEAKER_21]: Dear President Bears and members of the City Council, I respect the request and recommend that your Honorable Body vote as reviewed, the following as reviewed by the Massachusetts School Business Authority, I think I should say School Building Authority, and we may need to correct that.

2619
04:04:46,491 --> 04:05:10,499
[SPEAKER_21]: that the City of Medford appropriates the amount of $3 million, $3 million, for the purpose of paying costs for the feasibility study for Medford High School, currently located at 489 Winthrop Street, Medford, Massachusetts, including the payment of all costs, incidental or related thereto, and for which the City of Medford may be eligible for a grant from the Massachusetts School Building Authority, MSBA, and the set amount to be expended under the direction of the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee.

2620
04:05:10,799 --> 04:05:15,701
[SPEAKER_21]: To meet this appropriation, the Mayor, with the approval of the City Council, proposes the use of $3 million in free cash.

2621
04:05:16,101 --> 04:05:38,752
[SPEAKER_21]: The City of Medford acknowledges that the MSBA's grant program is a non-entitlement discretionary program based on need, as determined by the MSBA, and any costs the City of Medford incurs in excess of the grant approved by and received from the MSBA shall be the sole responsibility of the City of Medford, and that the amount authorized pursuant to this vote shall be reduced by any grant amount set forth in the feasibility study agreement that may be executed between the City of Medford and the MSBA.

2622
04:05:38,852 --> 04:05:40,393
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your kind attention in this matter.

2623
04:05:40,953 --> 04:05:42,734
[SPEAKER_21]: Respectfully submitted, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

2624
04:05:43,134 --> 04:05:44,615
[SPEAKER_21]: And I will go to the Chief of Staff,

2625
04:05:45,120 --> 04:05:46,521
[SPEAKER_21]: for a presentation of the paper.

2626
04:05:48,421 --> 04:05:50,322
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, President Bears, members of the council.

2627
04:05:50,342 --> 04:06:06,569
[SPEAKER_27]: As the council I'm sure knows, the city submitted a statement of interest back in early 2023 upon the approval of the city council among 56 other districts which had submitted at that time.

2628
04:06:07,579 --> 04:06:12,341
[SPEAKER_27]: 19 were invited into the eligibility period under the MSBA's requirements.

2629
04:06:13,921 --> 04:06:27,666
[SPEAKER_27]: Essentially, that's to say that the city of Medford's in a very small group of communities that have been given the opportunity to move forward for a potential grant from the MSBA for its high school.

2630
04:06:28,927 --> 04:06:41,276
[SPEAKER_27]: that leads us to where we are today, and this paper before the council is to ultimately appropriate $3 million for the use of a feasibility period study, which is one of the steps in the process.

2631
04:06:44,318 --> 04:06:44,818
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2632
04:06:44,838 --> 04:06:46,199
[SPEAKER_21]: I will go to Councilor Scarpelli.

2633
04:06:46,219 --> 04:06:48,461
[SPEAKER_21]: Council Lazzaro, Vice President Collins, Councilor Scarpelli.

2634
04:06:48,746 --> 04:06:49,527
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2635
04:06:50,628 --> 04:07:00,000
[SPEAKER_16]: Last week, I know we had a very informative meeting on the budget a few weeks ago when we talked about the processes and where this money is coming from.

2636
04:07:00,741 --> 04:07:05,046
[SPEAKER_16]: And we voted for an override.

2637
04:07:06,898 --> 04:07:14,981
[SPEAKER_16]: and an override that put forth the onus on the children in the schools.

2638
04:07:15,841 --> 04:07:19,743
[SPEAKER_16]: And I put forth a recommendation to look at free cash.

2639
04:07:20,283 --> 04:07:21,624
[SPEAKER_16]: We then noticed that,

2640
04:07:25,285 --> 04:07:33,111
[SPEAKER_16]: We were informed that in this packet that we've now have $9 million added to that free cash to roughly $34 million.

2641
04:07:33,371 --> 04:07:43,920
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm curious, when you went through this process, did the financial task force identify, did they know about that $9 million as it's going forward?

2642
04:07:45,801 --> 04:07:54,066
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President, through you, I don't recall any discussions on the financial task force as to the specific amount in free cash.

2643
04:07:54,166 --> 04:07:56,967
[SPEAKER_27]: We didn't have those details at the time of our last meeting.

2644
04:07:57,908 --> 04:08:09,835
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so I know that my fellow councils, we have five money papers in front of us, and they, I believe, what was it you implemented?

2645
04:08:11,830 --> 04:08:15,153
[SPEAKER_16]: the rules to avoid Rule 21.

2646
04:08:16,794 --> 04:08:36,269
[SPEAKER_16]: I will do this with all the papers tonight, but as my right, I'm invoking state law under Chapter 43, Section 22, which reads, Section 22, any ordinance or order or resolution may be passed through all stages of legislation at one session, provided that no member of the Council objects thereto.

2647
04:08:37,390 --> 04:08:41,292
[SPEAKER_16]: If any member of the council objects, the measure shall be postponed for that meeting.

2648
04:08:41,392 --> 04:08:49,516
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to vote that right for the fact that we're pushing things through and we're not getting the information, at least this council is not getting the information they want.

2649
04:08:50,136 --> 04:08:59,180
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a tactic that's very silly that we're going to try to get information that was passed, that was information that was given to me.

2650
04:08:59,680 --> 04:09:05,923
[SPEAKER_16]: And I made sure that we reached out to the state legal department and they said, any budget paper,

2651
04:09:06,523 --> 04:09:31,701
[SPEAKER_16]: If this is invoked, our ordinance is invoked, then I can supersede that with the state ordinance until I, as one city council, who finds this process so faulty, and so smelling with the lack of transparency, that we're so confused of where this money is coming from, and I've used this many, many times.

2652
04:09:33,062 --> 04:09:34,303
[SPEAKER_16]: You're all very bright people.

2653
04:09:35,566 --> 04:09:38,848
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not saying anybody's doing anything illegal.

2654
04:09:39,008 --> 04:09:41,269
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm telling you this is financial mismanagement.

2655
04:09:41,989 --> 04:09:46,991
[SPEAKER_16]: We asked for a $7.5 million override on the fare of our families and children.

2656
04:09:47,972 --> 04:09:57,396
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to propose a $5 million free cash proposal that eliminate that fare, then the community can look to see whether we need an override or not, which I wouldn't oppose.

2657
04:09:58,116 --> 04:10:00,657
[SPEAKER_16]: But instead, we required it.

2658
04:10:01,097 --> 04:10:01,798
[SPEAKER_16]: I was stifled.

2659
04:10:03,154 --> 04:10:08,097
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we moved to the next meeting, which was the budget meeting, and we had similar questions.

2660
04:10:09,537 --> 04:10:13,359
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we move to the next meeting, we come up with $9 million.

2661
04:10:14,360 --> 04:10:20,503
[SPEAKER_16]: We have $34 million in free cash, with an override still hanging out there.

2662
04:10:21,023 --> 04:10:22,884
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we still nervous about the kids in the schools?

2663
04:10:23,644 --> 04:10:29,147
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I have the right to invoke this rule, and I do so, and I will do with all money papers tonight.

2664
04:10:29,447 --> 04:10:30,228
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2665
04:10:30,916 --> 04:10:40,518
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, whereas chapter 43, section 22 applies to ordinances and their multiple readings, and none of the papers require multiple readings.

2666
04:10:40,538 --> 04:10:43,439
[SPEAKER_21]: We're gonna keep moving on this.

2667
04:10:43,459 --> 04:10:45,759
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a question to the chair.

2668
04:10:45,819 --> 04:10:55,741
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been instructed by legal industry that this is a money paper that I can implement at my disposal, in my discretion, and I do so.

2669
04:10:55,781 --> 04:10:59,702
[SPEAKER_15]: So I question the chair, if you wanna stretch this out even longer,

2670
04:11:01,855 --> 04:11:03,578
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have a written legal opinion I can review?

2671
04:11:06,202 --> 04:11:07,964
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there a written legal opinion for review by the chair?

2672
04:11:07,984 --> 04:11:12,791
[SPEAKER_15]: I am opposing rule 22.

2673
04:11:14,639 --> 04:11:18,100
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Chapter 43, Section 22 applies to ordinances for multiple readings.

2674
04:11:18,280 --> 04:11:19,060
[SPEAKER_21]: General law.

2675
04:11:19,380 --> 04:11:20,361
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm reading it right now.

2676
04:11:20,381 --> 04:11:25,042
[SPEAKER_17]: General law, Title 1, Title 12, Chapter 43, Section 22.

2677
04:11:25,082 --> 04:11:26,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I have it in front of me.

2678
04:11:26,562 --> 04:11:27,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

2679
04:11:27,182 --> 04:11:27,903
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate it.

2680
04:11:27,923 --> 04:11:29,583
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, it reads.

2681
04:11:29,623 --> 04:11:32,224
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to play the game, so I'm playing the game with you guys.

2682
04:11:32,444 --> 04:11:32,984
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, I'm saying.

2683
04:11:33,004 --> 04:11:38,546
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it's kind of funny that when you want to talk about information, I've implemented my right.

2684
04:11:38,746 --> 04:11:41,426
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli, do you have a written legal opinion for the chair on this matter?

2685
04:11:41,747 --> 04:11:43,227
[SPEAKER_21]: I will get you that tomorrow.

2686
04:11:43,747 --> 04:11:46,428
[SPEAKER_21]: I limit choice of the discretion of the chairs that I read.

2687
04:11:47,028 --> 04:11:48,249
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll read chapter 43, section 22.

2688
04:11:48,289 --> 04:11:56,152
[SPEAKER_21]: Any ordinance order or resolution may be passed through all its stages of legislation at one session, provided that no member of the council objects thereto.

2689
04:11:56,532 --> 04:11:59,354
[SPEAKER_21]: But if any member of the council objects, the measure shall be postponed for that meeting.

2690
04:11:59,834 --> 04:12:09,258
[SPEAKER_21]: Ordinances have multiple stages of legislation, a first reading, a second reading, and a third reading, whereas none of the paper, at least the paper before us, and if your intent is to apply it to 24428, 24432,

2691
04:12:12,859 --> 04:12:13,000
[SPEAKER_21]: 24433 and 24434.

2692
04:12:17,335 --> 04:12:19,416
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I'd have to read 24434.

2693
04:12:19,937 --> 04:12:23,279
[SPEAKER_21]: That may be an ordinance amendment, but at least the first four are not ordinances.

2694
04:12:23,319 --> 04:12:24,920
[SPEAKER_21]: They don't require multiple stages.

2695
04:12:25,520 --> 04:12:29,243
[SPEAKER_21]: And therefore the objection doesn't apply and the rule, the law doesn't apply.

2696
04:12:29,263 --> 04:12:37,248
[SPEAKER_21]: The law does because if the council would like to provide a legal opinion to the chair, we've done that.

2697
04:12:37,408 --> 04:12:42,192
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you want, I've questioned the chair, I've put in the rule moving forward.

2698
04:12:42,632 --> 04:12:46,534
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a motion to challenge the ruling of the chair by councilor Scarpelli.

2699
04:12:46,575 --> 04:12:47,175
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there a second?

2700
04:12:51,179 --> 04:12:51,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

2701
04:12:52,059 --> 04:12:55,683
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion to challenge the ruling of the chair by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Leming.

2702
04:12:55,703 --> 04:12:56,764
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

2703
04:12:57,945 --> 04:12:59,126
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it isn't debatable.

2704
04:12:59,286 --> 04:13:00,067
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not debatable.

2705
04:13:00,327 --> 04:13:03,009
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, the principle here is absolutely unquestionable.

2706
04:13:03,049 --> 04:13:03,650
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not debatable.

2707
04:13:03,670 --> 04:13:04,771
[SPEAKER_21]: The motion is not debatable.

2708
04:13:04,871 --> 04:13:06,112
[SPEAKER_16]: The rule is not debatable.

2709
04:13:06,232 --> 04:13:07,033
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't apply.

2710
04:13:07,513 --> 04:13:08,795
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, remember.

2711
04:13:10,230 --> 04:13:15,434
[SPEAKER_16]: When you pulled this last week, I did my due diligence to make sure that the information is getting out there.

2712
04:13:15,475 --> 04:13:27,445
[SPEAKER_16]: It's funny, we can have five meetings in subcommittee about a newsletter, but you wanna take these motions on money papers and force it down people's throat without giving it its due diligence.

2713
04:13:27,465 --> 04:13:28,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Shame on all of you.

2714
04:13:28,426 --> 04:13:31,028
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I think it has plenty of due diligence.

2715
04:13:31,048 --> 04:13:32,429
[SPEAKER_21]: There you go, rule 22.

2716
04:13:32,569 --> 04:13:33,470
[SPEAKER_21]: The motion's undebatable.

2717
04:13:34,351 --> 04:13:35,932
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

2718
04:13:35,952 --> 04:13:37,754
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

2719
04:13:39,406 --> 04:13:40,867
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

2720
04:13:42,688 --> 04:13:43,708
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Callahan.

2721
04:13:47,830 --> 04:13:56,434
[SPEAKER_21]: This is on the motion to overrule the ruling of the chair that chapter 43, section 22 does not apply to this paper as this paper is not an ordinance that requires three readings.

2722
04:14:02,658 --> 04:14:03,378
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Callahan.

2723
04:14:09,286 --> 04:14:14,528
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll go to the next.

2724
04:14:14,548 --> 04:14:15,108
[SPEAKER_39]: Yeah.

2725
04:14:15,128 --> 04:14:15,168
[SPEAKER_39]: No.

2726
04:14:16,128 --> 04:14:16,288
No.

2727
04:14:16,368 --> 04:14:16,528
No.

2728
04:14:17,729 --> 04:14:17,989
No.

2729
04:14:18,129 --> 04:14:18,289
Yes.

2730
04:14:18,369 --> 04:14:18,529
No.

2731
04:14:18,889 --> 04:14:19,209
[SPEAKER_19]: Said no.

2732
04:14:38,528 --> 04:14:52,953
[SPEAKER_21]: No negative emotion fails the ruling of the chairs that chapter 43 section 22 does not apply to this I would appreciate if you could provide it tonight without legal fighting for transparency and open government

2733
04:15:06,243 --> 04:15:06,864
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll text you, Ken.

2734
04:15:07,324 --> 04:15:08,485
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll talk about it.

2735
04:15:08,525 --> 04:15:09,606
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's a disgrace.

2736
04:15:10,127 --> 04:15:13,550
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you know, again, there's been no evidence presented.

2737
04:15:13,570 --> 04:15:20,716
[SPEAKER_15]: Have any of you talked to the administration for $9 million?

2738
04:15:20,816 --> 04:15:25,481
[SPEAKER_15]: The 20, the July.

2739
04:15:25,781 --> 04:15:27,663
[SPEAKER_15]: You agree to call on Bob anytime.

2740
04:15:28,527 --> 04:15:31,288
[SPEAKER_21]: We're gonna maintain business and we're gonna move forward on this item.

2741
04:15:33,489 --> 04:15:38,330
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, so many people are so, so many accusations of shame.

2742
04:15:38,650 --> 04:15:39,990
[SPEAKER_21]: So many accusations.

2743
04:15:40,891 --> 04:15:41,951
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's move ahead.

2744
04:15:42,371 --> 04:15:44,292
[SPEAKER_21]: I would like to continue on this item.

2745
04:15:44,992 --> 04:15:47,173
[SPEAKER_21]: Are these questions related to the item before us?

2746
04:15:47,713 --> 04:15:51,474
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll go to Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming and Vice President Collins and then Councilor Sviggum.

2747
04:15:54,335 --> 04:15:56,095
[SPEAKER_21]: Forum is for, required.

2748
04:15:56,275 --> 04:15:56,796
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2749
04:15:57,176 --> 04:15:57,856
[SPEAKER_21]: And yes.

2750
04:16:00,136 --> 04:16:11,280
[SPEAKER_37]: I just wanted to speak on the appropriation for Medford High School MSBA feasibility study, which is required for us to receive any funding from the MSBA.

2751
04:16:11,320 --> 04:16:14,001
[SPEAKER_37]: We must do a feasibility study.

2752
04:16:15,102 --> 04:16:24,305
[SPEAKER_37]: The way that free cash works is that it is calculated based on what was budgeted for the prior year,

2753
04:16:26,265 --> 04:16:27,826
[SPEAKER_37]: and what was spent.

2754
04:16:28,186 --> 04:16:42,952
[SPEAKER_37]: So free cash will come about at various points during the year and if it's not spent, it shows up and is available for the use of the municipality at various points.

2755
04:16:43,052 --> 04:16:46,233
[SPEAKER_37]: That's why free cash became available.

2756
04:16:46,413 --> 04:16:50,614
[SPEAKER_37]: Free cash is being used for this non-negotiable

2757
04:16:52,355 --> 04:17:03,082
[SPEAKER_37]: feasibility study that we must do if we hope to ever have access to Massachusetts School Building Authority funding.

2758
04:17:04,122 --> 04:17:06,944
[SPEAKER_37]: Since we are shortlisted, I'm on the building committee.

2759
04:17:07,565 --> 04:17:08,765
[SPEAKER_37]: We have been meeting about this.

2760
04:17:10,106 --> 04:17:17,711
[SPEAKER_37]: This committee, this council must approve this in order to move forward with building a new high school.

2761
04:17:18,071 --> 04:17:20,653
[SPEAKER_37]: So it's imperative that we approve this.

2762
04:17:22,093 --> 04:17:22,393
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2763
04:17:22,694 --> 04:17:23,114
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2764
04:17:23,314 --> 04:17:28,139
[SPEAKER_21]: And just before we continue, I just want to explain the free cash process.

2765
04:17:29,800 --> 04:17:36,887
[SPEAKER_21]: As Councilor Lazzaro was noting, the previous free cash certification was for July 1 of 2022.

2766
04:17:36,947 --> 04:17:40,130
[SPEAKER_21]: That was in the amount of $25 million and change.

2767
04:17:40,970 --> 04:17:44,454
[SPEAKER_21]: Last week, the Department of the Division of Local Services, I believe,

2768
04:17:45,534 --> 04:17:49,638
[SPEAKER_21]: issued a free cash certification for the city as of July 1, 2023.

2769
04:17:50,759 --> 04:18:01,628
[SPEAKER_21]: While the free cash amount was not certified, and that amount was $34 million, while that amount had not been certified when the financial task force was having its discussions, we were very aware

2770
04:18:02,128 --> 04:18:09,571
[SPEAKER_21]: that the reason for free cash balance amounts and the certification of amounts was due to essentially three factors.

2771
04:18:10,211 --> 04:18:17,214
[SPEAKER_21]: One was the use of ARPA funds provided by the federal government instead of free cash in many situations over the past three fiscal years.

2772
04:18:18,075 --> 04:18:23,157
[SPEAKER_21]: The second was the conservative estimation of local receipts as part of revenues.

2773
04:18:23,197 --> 04:18:24,037
[SPEAKER_21]: I see Councilor Leming.

2774
04:18:25,258 --> 04:18:27,519
[SPEAKER_21]: Was the conservative estimation of local receipts.

2775
04:18:29,039 --> 04:18:42,649
[SPEAKER_21]: As part of the local revenues, as we heard from our finance director this year, the amount estimated for local receipts for the fiscal 25 budget is at the upper bounds of comfort of what we have submitted, and I'm seeing a smirk and smile.

2776
04:18:43,730 --> 04:18:46,871
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Dickinson, and it's a fingers crossed.

2777
04:18:48,112 --> 04:19:01,397
[SPEAKER_21]: And the third was turned back to open positions, most of which have been filled, there was no expectation whatsoever by anyone familiar with the finances of the city that we will continue to see free cash balance increases of five to $10 million a year.

2778
04:19:02,698 --> 04:19:19,552
[SPEAKER_21]: Those are not reliable revenue sources, they're not stable revenue sources, and they are not responsible revenue sources to base our budgets on or to suggest that we have enough funding for Medford Public Schools or for DPW or for a new Medford Fire Headquarters.

2779
04:19:19,672 --> 04:19:21,894
[SPEAKER_21]: So those are the facts of free cash.

2780
04:19:21,934 --> 04:19:25,016
[SPEAKER_21]: Those are the financial statistics of our community.

2781
04:19:25,457 --> 04:19:28,299
[SPEAKER_21]: That is why even though there is a free cash balance certified

2782
04:19:28,939 --> 04:19:41,591
[SPEAKER_21]: as of July 1, 2023 for fiscal 24, $34 million that we need the stable recurring revenues as proposed by the mayor and approved by the council for the override votes in November.

2783
04:19:42,192 --> 04:19:44,574
[SPEAKER_21]: This is not, free cash is not a solution to those problems.

2784
04:19:44,614 --> 04:19:45,915
[SPEAKER_21]: It never has been and it never will be.

2785
04:19:48,404 --> 04:19:53,627
[SPEAKER_21]: We also have this amount, which is good, basically thanks to the federal ARPA program.

2786
04:19:54,027 --> 04:20:03,072
[SPEAKER_21]: There is a documentation in here outlining the draft free cash plan of the administration, which we can discuss tonight and consider further as a council.

2787
04:20:05,113 --> 04:20:16,959
[SPEAKER_21]: It brings us back down very, very quickly with our capital needs to the 10 to $15 million range of free cash reserves recommended by all of the state financial agencies for

2788
04:20:17,833 --> 04:20:24,064
[SPEAKER_21]: communities to have I think it's between five and 7% of their annual budget in a reserve and that's where this will bring us so.

2789
04:20:26,055 --> 04:20:30,176
[SPEAKER_21]: The federal ARPA program did give us some spending in recent years that we otherwise wouldn't have had.

2790
04:20:30,776 --> 04:20:33,317
[SPEAKER_21]: It gave us a little boost to address capital needs.

2791
04:20:33,797 --> 04:20:50,761
[SPEAKER_21]: Those capital needs, even if we spent all 34 million on them tomorrow, would not address the massive capital deficit we have for our city facilities, school facilities, roads, sidewalks, water and sewer system, which as we've discussed at numerous meetings of this council, is in the hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars.

2792
04:20:52,081 --> 04:20:55,502
[SPEAKER_21]: With that, I will go to Vice President Collins.

2793
04:20:57,162 --> 04:20:58,803
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, President Bears.

2794
04:20:58,843 --> 04:21:13,810
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it's always helpful to have kind of a refresher on what free cash is and where it comes from, and the instability of that as a revenue source.

2795
04:21:15,371 --> 04:21:16,331
[SPEAKER_29]: I was thinking about it today.

2796
04:21:16,351 --> 04:21:26,276
[SPEAKER_29]: I was thinking about different ways to articulate it, and I think this is probably an imperfect way of conceptualizing it, but I was thinking of free cash as money that we did not intend to save, and that's partly true.

2797
04:21:26,836 --> 04:21:36,082
[SPEAKER_29]: But in part, our free cash is amassed because of positions that we intended to fill and pay people salaries for that because of various reasons, we didn't.

2798
04:21:37,023 --> 04:21:53,113
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think the responsible thing to do with public resources when we intended to use it for one source and we for some reason couldn't spend it on, for example, a salary, is to use that as revenue for paying for a capital need.

2799
04:21:54,758 --> 04:22:03,664
[SPEAKER_29]: where we otherwise wouldn't be able to amass the resources to, you know, we know that we have great capital needs in the city of Medford on so many of our public buildings.

2800
04:22:06,466 --> 04:22:16,193
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, I could list them, but we don't even really need to between our public buildings and our roads and sidewalks and the high school, you know, on the topic of analogies.

2801
04:22:20,546 --> 04:22:22,547
[SPEAKER_29]: We don't need more, we don't need more analogies tonight.

2802
04:22:23,587 --> 04:22:41,255
[SPEAKER_29]: I think what's what's what feels like a central fact to me in making any decision about where to appropriate a free cash is that, you know, to rephrase, it's in no way a sustainable or predictable revenue source I think that we can certainly expect to responsibly to have.

2803
04:22:42,755 --> 04:22:57,978
[SPEAKER_29]: less free cash certified at the end of this fiscal year than we did at the end of this one, because a lot of those areas where we weren't spending as much as we were budgeting in FY 24, I know the administration worked really hard to get those out of the budget so that we could make the most use of every dollar that we are budgeting for.

2804
04:22:59,719 --> 04:23:05,760
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think it's incredibly irresponsible to spend funds that have a really clear

2805
04:23:07,000 --> 04:23:14,521
[SPEAKER_29]: floor at the bottom of that bank account on needs that are not going away because they're part of our operating budget and they pay for the school experience and pay for teachers.

2806
04:23:17,142 --> 04:23:19,182
[SPEAKER_29]: Because what are we going to do when that money is gone?

2807
04:23:19,462 --> 04:23:20,822
[SPEAKER_29]: It's not a sustainable revenue source.

2808
04:23:22,163 --> 04:23:24,363
[SPEAKER_29]: But then I'm getting onto a future topic here.

2809
04:23:25,063 --> 04:23:34,265
[SPEAKER_29]: On the topic of the MSBA feasibility study, and we're talking about transparent government and, you know, leading in a way that manifests the will of the public.

2810
04:23:34,765 --> 04:23:35,385
[SPEAKER_29]: I know that a

2811
04:23:36,445 --> 04:23:38,666
[SPEAKER_29]: better, safer, more vibrant, more appropriate.

2812
04:23:38,826 --> 04:23:43,127
[SPEAKER_29]: Medford High School is something that so many people in the community have been crying out for for such a long time.

2813
04:23:43,908 --> 04:23:50,750
[SPEAKER_29]: And this appropriation is a necessary step in the process of maintaining our eligibility for getting the funding that could get us there.

2814
04:23:52,811 --> 04:23:53,891
[SPEAKER_29]: And so this vote is crucial.

2815
04:23:54,191 --> 04:23:57,793
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think this is an unambiguously good use for this $3 million.

2816
04:23:57,993 --> 04:23:59,313
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'll motion to approve.

2817
04:24:01,854 --> 04:24:02,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

2818
04:24:02,674 --> 04:24:03,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2819
04:24:05,660 --> 04:24:14,366
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to meditate too much on this, but I would like to clarify because I said that I talked to the administration about free cash.

2820
04:24:14,486 --> 04:24:29,296
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to clarify what I mean when I say that I talked to the administration is I Googled Bob Dickinson, the finance director's phone number, left him a voicemail, and then he got back to me and we talked for like, you know, half an hour about

2821
04:24:29,736 --> 04:24:34,098
[SPEAKER_11]: free cash, because when I saw, you know, $9 million, I was kind of like, what's going on here?

2822
04:24:34,598 --> 04:24:47,083
[SPEAKER_11]: And so then, you know, the finance director has been working in this area for years, and me, who, as an elected official, doesn't suddenly mean that I know everything about finance, I talked to him about it, I asked my questions.

2823
04:24:47,563 --> 04:24:52,085
[SPEAKER_11]: And he explained, you know, what the situation was, it's not a simple issue.

2824
04:24:53,306 --> 04:24:55,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Cities are kind of on a one year delay.

2825
04:24:55,146 --> 04:24:58,568
[SPEAKER_11]: So in many ways, we're dealing now with what was budgeted last year, and we are

2826
04:24:59,008 --> 04:25:02,131
[SPEAKER_11]: going to be in our budget, and we're trying to predict what the budget will be next year.

2827
04:25:02,191 --> 04:25:03,752
[SPEAKER_11]: They always come up with conservative estimates.

2828
04:25:03,812 --> 04:25:11,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of the free cash comes from the fact that the police department couldn't hire 10 police officers, so that's $800,000 extra in free cash.

2829
04:25:12,119 --> 04:25:17,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, if we want to be able to fill those positions, that is not revenue that we can expect to come in.

2830
04:25:18,525 --> 04:25:18,985
[SPEAKER_11]: next year.

2831
04:25:19,326 --> 04:25:25,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of it just came from poor, inaccurate estimations in previous years of what healthcare costs would be.

2832
04:25:25,473 --> 04:25:29,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Those things are always hard to predict.

2833
04:25:29,939 --> 04:25:32,402
[SPEAKER_11]: And part of this is the fact that we

2834
04:25:33,263 --> 04:25:38,751
[SPEAKER_11]: implement, you know, we have these one time very big studies to try to invest in our city.

2835
04:25:38,811 --> 04:25:46,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, we're debating many of those tonight costs like 15 million bucks to replace the HVAC systems for the middle school.

2836
04:25:46,381 --> 04:25:48,384
[SPEAKER_11]: So we need to, we need to spend, we need to

2837
04:25:50,106 --> 04:25:51,287
[SPEAKER_11]: fix that.

2838
04:25:51,628 --> 04:25:53,810
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can't just say, Oh, here's $9 million.

2839
04:25:53,850 --> 04:26:04,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we should use that on salaries, continuing costs, which will just sink, which will just like eat up all of that money in a couple of years.

2840
04:26:04,340 --> 04:26:08,324
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, in order to appropriately finance the city, it's not

2841
04:26:09,645 --> 04:26:14,267
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not an easy thing to explain, but at the end of the day, free cash goes to one-time costs.

2842
04:26:14,287 --> 04:26:19,310
[SPEAKER_11]: You cannot count on it as an ongoing source of revenue, especially to handle salaries.

2843
04:26:19,610 --> 04:26:32,017
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing to note is that being an elected official doesn't mean that people will suddenly make an effort to call me

2844
04:26:32,717 --> 04:26:35,338
[SPEAKER_11]: to give me information and include me in on things.

2845
04:26:35,398 --> 04:26:51,785
[SPEAKER_11]: It's my job to go out and seek that information and try to educate myself on things that happen, you know, just because, you know, being elected basically means that I get to sit in the seat and talk for however long I can.

2846
04:26:52,745 --> 04:26:58,449
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm allowed to, and vote on ordinances.

2847
04:26:58,489 --> 04:27:06,175
[SPEAKER_11]: If I was not involved in the financial task force in order to figure out how things work, any city councilor can do this.

2848
04:27:06,495 --> 04:27:13,940
[SPEAKER_11]: You call up somebody, you seek out that information, you build up those relationships, and if you choose not to do that, then you won't be included.

2849
04:27:14,181 --> 04:27:15,081
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just how it works.

2850
04:27:15,682 --> 04:27:17,883
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd just like to clarify that.

2851
04:27:18,444 --> 04:27:18,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2852
04:27:26,164 --> 04:27:28,466
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll second Vice President Collins' motion.

2853
04:27:31,028 --> 04:27:35,111
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further discussion on the MSBA feasibility study, or is there a motion on the floor?

2854
04:27:35,131 --> 04:27:36,972
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanna say I'm excited for it.

2855
04:27:36,992 --> 04:27:38,353
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Tseng, sorry.

2856
04:27:38,453 --> 04:27:39,294
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm excited for this.

2857
04:27:39,494 --> 04:27:40,855
[SPEAKER_18]: I think our community needs this.

2858
04:27:40,895 --> 04:27:45,959
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to assess our needs and the feasibility of a project that so many residents have been asking for.

2859
04:27:46,780 --> 04:27:48,101
[SPEAKER_18]: Great, motion's on the floor.

2860
04:27:48,121 --> 04:27:54,486
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there a motion on the floor to approve by Councilor Lazzaro, by Councilor Collins?

2861
04:27:55,796 --> 04:27:58,597
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming.

2862
04:27:59,158 --> 04:28:08,082
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion to approve this appropriation of $3 million for the MSBA, and is there an amendment to the paper to change business to building?

2863
04:28:11,804 --> 04:28:16,367
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion to approve as amended by Vice President Collins, as seconded by Councilor Leming.

2864
04:28:17,087 --> 04:28:17,948
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further discussion?

2865
04:28:19,308 --> 04:28:20,469
[SPEAKER_21]: Discussion members of the public?

2866
04:28:20,709 --> 04:28:21,850
[SPEAKER_21]: Can I have an address for the record, please?

2867
04:28:21,870 --> 04:28:22,790
[SPEAKER_21]: You have three minutes.

2868
04:28:25,270 --> 04:28:26,451
[SPEAKER_14]: An obvious question to me.

2869
04:28:27,331 --> 04:28:36,035
[SPEAKER_14]: We just realized that the citizens of Medford were overtaxed $9 million in fiscal year 23, and free cash went up that $9 million.

2870
04:28:36,055 --> 04:28:37,115
[SPEAKER_14]: That's in fact what happened.

2871
04:28:38,156 --> 04:28:40,237
[SPEAKER_14]: They were overtaxed $9 million, all right?

2872
04:28:40,677 --> 04:28:43,738
[SPEAKER_14]: So now we have a $3 million feasibility study, right?

2873
04:28:44,639 --> 04:28:45,779
[SPEAKER_14]: That we're just voting on today?

2874
04:28:46,940 --> 04:28:48,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Feasibility study that you just talked about?

2875
04:28:49,161 --> 04:28:51,702
[SPEAKER_14]: That is a one-time use, one-time expenditure

2876
04:28:53,939 --> 04:28:57,360
[SPEAKER_14]: which is necessary and proper as a free cash expenditure.

2877
04:28:58,300 --> 04:29:02,641
[SPEAKER_14]: Why wouldn't we use that and free up that money for everything else?

2878
04:29:05,421 --> 04:29:07,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that a certified use of free cash?

2879
04:29:07,421 --> 04:29:14,583
[SPEAKER_14]: A legitimate, necessary, and proper use of free cash is a one-time expenditure, which is the $3 million that you just spoke about.

2880
04:29:14,603 --> 04:29:17,123
[SPEAKER_14]: You can ask Bob Dickinson about it, he'll agree with you.

2881
04:29:17,463 --> 04:29:19,344
[SPEAKER_14]: There are many things that you just talked about.

2882
04:29:20,044 --> 04:29:21,184
[SPEAKER_14]: HVAC systems,

2883
04:29:22,108 --> 04:29:22,728
[SPEAKER_14]: for the schools.

2884
04:29:23,349 --> 04:29:27,732
[SPEAKER_14]: That is a one-time, one-off expenditure that can come from free cash.

2885
04:29:28,653 --> 04:29:34,297
[SPEAKER_14]: There are plenty of things in this budget that are qualified to be used from free cash.

2886
04:29:34,497 --> 04:29:45,546
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a $9 million overtaxing of the citizens that we just found out about from last year that could and should be used free cash expenditure.

2887
04:29:46,368 --> 04:29:47,769
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just wondering why we're not doing that.

2888
04:29:48,689 --> 04:29:51,631
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's obvious to me where this money should go.

2889
04:29:51,691 --> 04:29:52,911
[SPEAKER_14]: It should go back to the taxpayers.

2890
04:29:54,032 --> 04:30:00,015
[SPEAKER_14]: And this would free up money for other projects, other recurring things that you can't use free cash for.

2891
04:30:01,661 --> 04:30:07,465
[SPEAKER_14]: So just a question, suggestion, something that would help this budget and budgets to come.

2892
04:30:07,625 --> 04:30:07,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2893
04:30:08,226 --> 04:30:16,051
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, the free cash balance that we have has come from unfilled positions, underestimated revenues, mainly in local receipts.

2894
04:30:16,551 --> 04:30:20,494
[SPEAKER_21]: So not really from the property tax and from the use of federal funds.

2895
04:30:20,594 --> 04:30:28,279
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're now proposing to use those balances on these one-time expenditures like the feasibility study and the other things outlined in the plan.

2896
04:30:29,994 --> 04:30:41,942
[SPEAKER_21]: Your income was more than your expenses, our expenses that we budgeted for we were not able to spend because of things like, for example, 10 police officer positions were unfilled many things.

2897
04:30:42,102 --> 04:30:49,287
[SPEAKER_21]: So, and there were many positions unfilled correct so any money that wasn't used then to pay for overtime was turned back.

2898
04:30:49,767 --> 04:31:08,818
[SPEAKER_21]: But we still need to budget that money going forward otherwise we'd have to cut 10 police officers or cut those firefighters so for that wasn't that there was an overtaxing, it was that the budget was not able to be spent exactly how was expected in June of the prior year so we, but we still need to spend that money, we took in more money than we expended.

2899
04:31:09,318 --> 04:31:10,439
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very simple.

2900
04:31:10,499 --> 04:31:12,341
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a balance, yes.

2901
04:31:12,401 --> 04:31:15,263
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't have to make it so hard as people can't understand it.

2902
04:31:15,323 --> 04:31:18,166
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think you're misrepresenting it, so I need to explain what it is.

2903
04:31:18,466 --> 04:31:19,867
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not, believe me.

2904
04:31:19,907 --> 04:31:22,369
[SPEAKER_14]: The citizens and the overtaxed.

2905
04:31:22,930 --> 04:31:27,834
[SPEAKER_14]: If we were to return that money and then not spend it, we would then have to fire 10 police officers.

2906
04:31:27,914 --> 04:31:29,275
[SPEAKER_14]: It should go back to the rate payers.

2907
04:31:29,415 --> 04:31:32,458
[SPEAKER_14]: You shouldn't be hoarding cash.

2908
04:31:32,678 --> 04:31:36,722
[SPEAKER_14]: $34 million is probably the most that City of Medford has ever had in free cash.

2909
04:31:37,779 --> 04:31:39,340
[SPEAKER_14]: It's way over and above what we need.

2910
04:31:39,640 --> 04:31:42,462
[SPEAKER_14]: You should be trying to break even every day.

2911
04:31:43,203 --> 04:31:49,888
[SPEAKER_14]: It should go back to the rate payers into these projects that it is applicable for.

2912
04:31:50,388 --> 04:31:51,309
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my point.

2913
04:31:51,549 --> 04:31:52,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2914
04:31:52,129 --> 04:31:53,230
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, that's what we're trying to do.

2915
04:31:53,330 --> 04:31:55,952
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to go to Mr. Castagnettititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititi on Zoom.

2916
04:31:55,972 --> 04:31:57,173
[SPEAKER_21]: Name and address for the record, please.

2917
04:31:57,193 --> 04:31:57,973
[SPEAKER_21]: You have three minutes.

2918
04:32:03,277 --> 04:32:04,658
[SPEAKER_19]: Andrew, I'm unmuting you.

2919
04:32:12,861 --> 04:32:17,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Honorable Councilor.

2920
04:32:19,223 --> 04:32:20,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Honorable Councilors.

2921
04:32:22,585 --> 04:32:23,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?

2922
04:32:23,845 --> 04:32:24,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we can hear you.

2923
04:32:24,666 --> 04:32:33,169
[SPEAKER_21]: You may need to mute your television.

2924
04:32:34,669 --> 04:32:36,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Free cash is not free.

2925
04:32:36,810 --> 04:32:38,091
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out of my pocket.

2926
04:32:38,771 --> 04:32:41,612
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out of all the other taxpayers' pockets.

2927
04:32:41,963 --> 04:32:48,268
[SPEAKER_04]: not just real estate, but excise taxes on the vehicle, et cetera, et cetera.

2928
04:32:50,230 --> 04:32:51,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the gentleman was right.

2929
04:32:51,991 --> 04:32:53,072
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an overcharge.

2930
04:32:53,473 --> 04:32:57,636
[SPEAKER_04]: That money actually belongs to the taxpayers, not to the city.

2931
04:32:58,757 --> 04:33:03,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Meffitt High School is only 54 years old, and it seems they can condemn it.

2932
04:33:06,564 --> 04:33:09,026
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a maintenance problem we have in Houston.

2933
04:33:10,325 --> 04:33:17,810
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not fair that you let our most assets in the city, our public buildings, become condemned.

2934
04:33:18,391 --> 04:33:19,051
[SPEAKER_04]: That's terrible.

2935
04:33:19,071 --> 04:33:20,912
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're putting it on our kids' charge card.

2936
04:33:20,932 --> 04:33:22,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Terrible.

2937
04:33:23,274 --> 04:33:28,738
[SPEAKER_04]: And this Prop 2.5 override business, it never, ever happened in Medford, Massachusetts.

2938
04:33:29,078 --> 04:33:29,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Never.

2939
04:33:29,939 --> 04:33:32,140
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not Winchester with deep pockets.

2940
04:33:32,601 --> 04:33:36,163
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working class people in Medford.

2941
04:33:37,198 --> 04:33:38,720
[SPEAKER_04]: The city is out of control.

2942
04:33:38,740 --> 04:33:39,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta go.

2943
04:33:39,901 --> 04:33:41,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good night, people.

2944
04:33:41,262 --> 04:33:46,606
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm gonna go to Jess H on Zoom.

2945
04:33:48,628 --> 04:33:50,149
[SPEAKER_21]: Jess, name and address for the record, please.

2946
04:33:50,189 --> 04:33:51,210
[SPEAKER_21]: You have three minutes.

2947
04:33:53,592 --> 04:33:55,293
[SPEAKER_35]: Jess Cahilly, 4 Lock Road.

2948
04:33:56,814 --> 04:34:01,318
[SPEAKER_35]: So I wanna know, where is this $3 million coming from?

2949
04:34:02,617 --> 04:34:12,349
[SPEAKER_21]: This is being appropriated from the city's free cash reserve for the one time expense of the school building authority feasibility study.

2950
04:34:14,291 --> 04:34:14,692
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay.

2951
04:34:15,332 --> 04:34:15,653
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

2952
04:34:15,893 --> 04:34:16,334
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2953
04:34:17,375 --> 04:34:17,775
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2954
04:34:19,097 --> 04:34:20,559
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further comment by members of the public.

2955
04:34:24,016 --> 04:34:33,299
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing none in the chamber and no hands on Zoom, on the motion of Vice President Collins, as seconded by Councilor Leming, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

2956
04:34:33,379 --> 04:34:34,059
[SPEAKER_21]: As amended.

2957
04:34:34,939 --> 04:34:35,379
Yes.

2958
04:34:35,439 --> 04:34:35,780
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2959
04:34:35,840 --> 04:34:36,080
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

2960
04:34:36,920 --> 04:34:37,140
Yes.

2961
04:34:52,822 --> 04:35:01,436
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, affirmative one absent the motion passes.

2962
04:35:08,732 --> 04:35:14,194
[SPEAKER_21]: from Mayor Bernalino Kern to fund General Stabilization Establish and Fund Capital Stabilization Funds.

2963
04:35:14,814 --> 04:35:26,059
[SPEAKER_21]: Dear President Bears and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that Your Honorable Body vote to appropriate free cash in the amount of $6 million into the General Stabilization Fund established earlier this year by Your Honorable Body.

2964
04:35:26,559 --> 04:35:31,181
[SPEAKER_21]: As you know, the vast majority of cities and towns in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts have a General Stabilization Fund.

2965
04:35:31,201 --> 04:35:33,742
[SPEAKER_21]: In order to provide for emergencies and unforeseen expenses,

2966
04:35:34,202 --> 04:35:38,703
[SPEAKER_21]: a simple majority of the City Council is required to appropriate funds into a stabilization fund.

2967
04:35:39,184 --> 04:35:50,367
[SPEAKER_21]: Further, in accordance with Chapter 40, Section 5b of the General Laws, I respect the request and recommend that Your Honorable Body take the following actions, each requiring a two-thirds majority vote of the City Council for establishment.

2968
04:35:50,927 --> 04:35:56,169
[SPEAKER_21]: One, establish a capital stabilization fund and vote to approve $5 million of free cash to this fund.

2969
04:35:56,729 --> 04:35:59,510
[SPEAKER_21]: Two, establish a water and sewer capital stabilization fund

2970
04:35:59,950 --> 04:36:02,791
[SPEAKER_21]: and vote to appropriate $2 million of retained earnings to this fund.

2971
04:36:03,292 --> 04:36:08,174
[SPEAKER_21]: As you are aware, free cash and retained earnings are only available after certification through June 30th of each year.

2972
04:36:08,674 --> 04:36:16,198
[SPEAKER_21]: Each year without a stabilization fund, the city could face significant challenges in addressing emergencies or capital needs from July 1st until free cash is certified.

2973
04:36:16,718 --> 04:36:25,062
[SPEAKER_21]: Chapter 40, section 5B of the general law stipulates that, quote, cities, towns, and districts may create one or more stabilization funds and appropriate any amount to the funds.

2974
04:36:25,543 --> 04:36:28,204
[SPEAKER_21]: The Division of Local Services, Financial Management Resource Bureau,

2975
04:36:28,684 --> 04:36:34,649
[SPEAKER_21]: Notes in a published article, quote, a city or town's capital assets are a vital part of providing essential services to residents.

2976
04:36:35,049 --> 04:36:45,957
[SPEAKER_21]: Capital assets include public buildings and structures, roadways, parks and fields, large equipment like dump trucks, mowers, fire engines, fire breathing apparatus, police cruisers, radio equipment, as well as land acquisitions.

2977
04:36:46,437 --> 04:36:54,023
[SPEAKER_21]: Major repairs to a capital asset or when it needs to be replaced unexpectedly or reaches its expected useful life early can be a significant shock to the budget.

2978
04:36:54,523 --> 04:36:56,665
[SPEAKER_21]: Additionally, deferred maintenance of capital needs,

2979
04:36:58,218 --> 04:37:05,362
[SPEAKER_21]: Existing capital assets is a major contributor to capital failures, as these necessary upkeep costs are sometimes avoided in the interest of balancing the budget.

2980
04:37:05,822 --> 04:37:15,168
[SPEAKER_21]: One way to better prepare for capital expenditures, both planned and unexpected, is to establish a special purpose capital stabilization fund dedicated to funding regular required capital repairs and maintenance.

2981
04:37:15,548 --> 04:37:18,149
[SPEAKER_21]: In close, please find a draft free cash plan for your review and input.

2982
04:37:18,570 --> 04:37:20,030
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

2983
04:37:20,070 --> 04:37:22,172
[SPEAKER_21]: Respectfully submitted, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

2984
04:37:23,152 --> 04:37:28,456
[SPEAKER_21]: And in terms of the free cash plan, we have a free cash and retained earnings update.

2985
04:37:28,516 --> 04:37:35,541
[SPEAKER_21]: Based on the unaudited balance sheet submitted, this is from the Department of Revenue Division of Local Services, notification of free cash approval.

2986
04:37:36,041 --> 04:37:43,507
[SPEAKER_21]: I hereby certify that the amount of available funds for free cash as of July 1 for City of Medford is General Fund $34,241,981, Enterprise Fund Water and Sewer $11,164,741,

2987
04:37:51,492 --> 04:37:55,997
[SPEAKER_21]: This certification is in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 59, Section 23 as amended.

2988
04:37:56,617 --> 04:38:10,671
[SPEAKER_21]: As per requests to the Council dated June 18, 2024, I am requesting the following funds be appropriated from free cash, $6 million General Stabilization Fund, $5 million Capital Stabilization Fund, $3 million Mass School Building Authority Feasibility Study,

2989
04:38:11,071 --> 04:38:12,373
[SPEAKER_21]: for a total of $14 million.

2990
04:38:12,913 --> 04:38:18,920
[SPEAKER_21]: The capital stabilization funding mentioned would be a source for fiscal 2024 and prior year capital improvement needs.

2991
04:38:19,320 --> 04:38:22,684
[SPEAKER_21]: For the remaining funds, I anticipate the following future appropriation requests.

2992
04:38:23,084 --> 04:38:29,852
[SPEAKER_21]: I welcome the Council's input on future appropriation requests before my office and the finance team work to finalize an initial roadmap for the funds.

2993
04:38:30,592 --> 04:38:32,835
[SPEAKER_21]: $1 million additional funding to renovate the Hegner Center.

2994
04:38:34,017 --> 04:38:45,157
[SPEAKER_21]: 2.5 million fire department fleet replacements, 2 million pension liability, 2 million fiscal year 2025 capital improvements, 2 million fiscal year 2026 capital improvements, $9.5 million.

2995
04:38:47,779 --> 04:38:51,721
[SPEAKER_21]: Please note that we do not anticipate future certifications to be as large as the last few years.

2996
04:38:52,141 --> 04:39:02,846
[SPEAKER_21]: There are many factors that contribute to the balance in free cash today, including conservative estimating of revenues in pandemic years, vacancies in personnel positions, health insurance budget turnbacks, and the availability of ARPA funds.

2997
04:39:03,327 --> 04:39:09,910
[SPEAKER_21]: While best practices still dictate that we should be somewhat conservative on revenue estimates, we push the envelope for fiscal 25 with our finance directors out.

2998
04:39:10,370 --> 04:39:15,914
[SPEAKER_21]: We're now able to process personal hires faster than we were able to in the past, and we are not expecting any health insurance turnbacks.

2999
04:39:16,315 --> 04:39:21,879
[SPEAKER_21]: Instead, actuals are showing a deficit for fiscal 24, and the ability to appropriate ARPA funds ends December 31, 2024.

3000
04:39:23,701 --> 04:39:30,606
[SPEAKER_21]: Finally, as the council may know, the Division of Local Services General Stabilization recommended goal is five to 7% of the current operating budget range.

3001
04:39:31,067 --> 04:39:33,749
[SPEAKER_21]: For Medford, five to 7% of the fiscal 25 budget would be 9.47, between 9.47 and 13.26 million.

3002
04:39:39,333 --> 04:39:41,195
[SPEAKER_21]: on funds certified for water sewer enterprise.

3003
04:39:41,596 --> 04:39:56,289
[SPEAKER_21]: As the council knows, $2 million is proposed for a capital stabilization fund specifically for water and sewer, and the city is presently performing a water system analysis capital plan and rate study, which will help further inform the city in its planning efforts to address the aging water infrastructure across the city.

3004
04:39:56,710 --> 04:39:58,151
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

3005
04:39:58,191 --> 04:40:00,413
[SPEAKER_21]: Respectfully submitted, Reinaldo Kernmayer.

3006
04:40:01,074 --> 04:40:02,996
[SPEAKER_21]: So right there, we're talking about $25 million.

3007
04:40:05,915 --> 04:40:11,119
[SPEAKER_21]: sorry, $23.5 million of that $34 million going either to stabilization funds or specific projects.

3008
04:40:12,139 --> 04:40:18,724
[SPEAKER_21]: There was a request for us to review an input on the free cash plan, so at some point we should discuss how we want to do that.

3009
04:40:19,224 --> 04:40:23,287
[SPEAKER_21]: And with that, I will go to Vice President Collins and then Chief of Staff Nazarian.

3010
04:40:23,887 --> 04:40:24,728
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

3011
04:40:25,328 --> 04:40:26,189
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, President Pierce.

3012
04:40:31,988 --> 04:40:57,076
[SPEAKER_29]: I want to preface by saying I haven't always been fully, in the past, I haven't felt fully comfortable with the volume of free cash that the city has amassed, but I think that this type of plan really puts data to the intuition that there's things, important, unskippable projects that this money is being saved and appropriated for, things that we do not have other sustainable ways of funding.

3013
04:40:58,757 --> 04:41:09,085
[SPEAKER_29]: whether it's, you know, fleet replacements in the fire department, stabilization funds, which are essentially, you know, a piggy bank for the city in the same way that a person or a household has a savings bank.

3014
04:41:10,306 --> 04:41:16,331
[SPEAKER_29]: Communities need them for the same reasons of responding to emergencies responsibly.

3015
04:41:18,251 --> 04:41:20,832
[SPEAKER_29]: liabilities for pensions and insurance.

3016
04:41:21,713 --> 04:41:30,936
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it's really helpful to have a draft of this plan for how this, you know, you just look at the number 25 million, 34 million now, you think, wow, that's a lot of money.

3017
04:41:30,976 --> 04:41:32,717
[SPEAKER_29]: Like, why, what are we sitting on that for?

3018
04:41:33,117 --> 04:41:42,080
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think it's so important to have a draft plan for how it's going to be appropriated, because that number gets whittled down very, very quickly when we take stock of the

3019
04:41:43,100 --> 04:41:56,583
[SPEAKER_29]: stabilization funds that we ought to get in line with best practices in terms of how much we are saving for those rainy days and emergencies and for the major operating capital expenses that we need funding for that we're not going to fund out of our operating budget.

3020
04:41:58,243 --> 04:41:59,604
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think that this is a great start.

3021
04:42:00,624 --> 04:42:03,284
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm very happy to approve this tonight.

3022
04:42:03,324 --> 04:42:11,646
[SPEAKER_29]: I would also want to put forward a B paper to schedule a committee of the whole to discuss the free cash plan in more detail with the council and with the administration.

3023
04:42:15,356 --> 04:42:17,317
[SPEAKER_21]: On the, I'm just gonna put it out there.

3024
04:42:17,337 --> 04:42:18,197
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm gonna go to the Chief of Staff.

3025
04:42:18,218 --> 04:42:26,782
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a B paper to schedule a committee of the whole with the administration to discuss the draft free cash plan.

3026
04:42:27,182 --> 04:42:30,123
[SPEAKER_21]: And then Councilor Collins has also made a motion to approve the main paper.

3027
04:42:30,183 --> 04:42:31,904
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there a second by Councilor Tseng?

3028
04:42:31,944 --> 04:42:32,845
[SPEAKER_21]: A second by Councilor Tseng.

3029
04:42:32,865 --> 04:42:36,247
[SPEAKER_21]: I will go to Chief of Staff Nazarian, and then I will go to Councilor Tseng.

3030
04:42:36,567 --> 04:42:37,107
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Chief of Staff.

3031
04:42:37,517 --> 04:42:39,278
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, President Bears, members of the council.

3032
04:42:39,839 --> 04:42:47,565
[SPEAKER_27]: I think the paper and its enclosure speaks for itself, and I appreciate the comments by Vice President Collins.

3033
04:42:47,826 --> 04:42:56,993
[SPEAKER_27]: I think the only thing that I'll say, and I think this is more for the community at large, as far as some more data points,

3034
04:43:00,888 --> 04:43:05,871
[SPEAKER_27]: Essentially 97% of communities have a general stabilization fund.

3035
04:43:05,931 --> 04:43:09,413
[SPEAKER_27]: This council adopted a general stabilization fund earlier this year.

3036
04:43:10,954 --> 04:43:16,357
[SPEAKER_27]: That was the first time the city of Medford went out of that 3% of communities.

3037
04:43:17,017 --> 04:43:22,200
[SPEAKER_27]: And in addition to that, the statewide average balance in FY21, that's the data point that I have.

3038
04:43:22,360 --> 04:43:25,182
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sure we could develop better data points because the

3039
04:43:25,914 --> 04:43:27,375
[SPEAKER_27]: state has a data bank.

3040
04:43:27,896 --> 04:43:31,539
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sure the council's aware of this, but again, these comments are mainly for the public.

3041
04:43:32,980 --> 04:43:44,971
[SPEAKER_27]: The state publishes a data bank, which each community contributes data towards as a requirement under its reporting, where further and more up-to-date information can be acquired.

3042
04:43:45,031 --> 04:43:50,456
[SPEAKER_27]: But the statewide average balance for this general stabilization fund was 6.5%.

3043
04:43:51,796 --> 04:43:57,838
[SPEAKER_27]: one 5% according to the data point that I have that was a part of an article published by the division of local services.

3044
04:43:59,418 --> 04:44:08,800
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, at this general stabilization fund proposed amount where we don't hit that average amount, but it is a beginning because we have to begin somewhere.

3045
04:44:08,880 --> 04:44:10,381
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's, I think a very good beginning.

3046
04:44:10,721 --> 04:44:13,761
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's one that I believe that the city is overdue on.

3047
04:44:16,262 --> 04:44:19,143
[SPEAKER_27]: I have other pieces of information and data points.

3048
04:44:19,483 --> 04:44:20,023
[SPEAKER_27]: I think a lot of

3049
04:44:21,169 --> 04:44:26,595
[SPEAKER_27]: .

3050
04:44:21,189 --> 04:44:26,595
[SPEAKER_27]: I think the relevant aspects of those points have been already stated by members of the Council, so I'm not going to restate them.

3051
04:44:26,775 --> 04:44:27,957
[SPEAKER_27]: I think the only further

3052
04:44:34,426 --> 04:44:42,152
[SPEAKER_27]: and retained earnings paper that we were really attempting to try to put all the thoughts that we've had in one place.

3053
04:44:42,492 --> 04:44:45,714
[SPEAKER_27]: And it was to kind of accumulate things there.

3054
04:44:46,074 --> 04:44:52,719
[SPEAKER_27]: There are other elements and the ones that the council has discussed as well, like an accounting software that probably should be here too.

3055
04:44:53,219 --> 04:44:56,582
[SPEAKER_27]: But again, we are asking for the council's input and we look forward to

3056
04:44:57,122 --> 04:45:00,925
[SPEAKER_27]: the information and thoughts that the council has to better improve this process and plan.

3057
04:45:00,965 --> 04:45:11,472
[SPEAKER_27]: But as was stated by you, President Bears, this is a way to demonstrate that these dollars are very much needed and they're going to be very well utilized across the organization.

3058
04:45:12,072 --> 04:45:14,173
[SPEAKER_27]: And again, I agree that

3059
04:45:15,114 --> 04:45:32,320
[SPEAKER_27]: These all the things that have been stated as to how these dollars came in to the city and how they cannot be used for reoccurring expenses, because we will get ourselves into a financial challenge in the future, not only with not only with the

3060
04:45:33,905 --> 04:45:37,169
[SPEAKER_27]: bond rating agencies, but in our own structural deficit.

3061
04:45:37,209 --> 04:45:39,753
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't want to dig ourselves into structural deficits again.

3062
04:45:39,793 --> 04:45:41,836
[SPEAKER_27]: We are climbing out of those structural deficits.

3063
04:45:42,216 --> 04:45:42,977
[SPEAKER_27]: So thank you.

3064
04:45:43,177 --> 04:45:43,999
[SPEAKER_27]: I wanted to be brief.

3065
04:45:44,319 --> 04:45:45,881
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm happy to answer any further questions.

3066
04:45:47,283 --> 04:45:48,164
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam Chair and staff.

3067
04:45:49,261 --> 04:45:50,141
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Tseng.

3068
04:45:50,482 --> 04:45:50,802
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

3069
04:45:50,862 --> 04:45:51,922
[SPEAKER_18]: And Councilor Callahan.

3070
04:45:52,423 --> 04:45:53,783
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Chief of Staff Nazarian.

3071
04:45:54,604 --> 04:46:11,773
[SPEAKER_18]: Agree or disagree with the specifics of the plan, I have to say it's really quite remarkable that in my time following it for politics, this is the first time I've seen a free cash plan laid out for the next few years like this in such a transparent manner, inviting us as a city council to take part in that.

3072
04:46:12,133 --> 04:46:13,514
[SPEAKER_18]: I really appreciate that effort.

3073
04:46:14,214 --> 04:46:15,915
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it really needs to be said.

3074
04:46:18,136 --> 04:46:25,541
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the plan also exemplifies the fact that we are spending this on one-time expenses, right?

3075
04:46:25,581 --> 04:46:27,122
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the sustainable way to do it.

3076
04:46:27,222 --> 04:46:31,125
[SPEAKER_18]: I know Councilors have been reiterating that message all night.

3077
04:46:34,063 --> 04:46:49,176
[SPEAKER_18]: It also highlights the fact that as much as I've advocated for using parts of it on recurring costs to cover one year, if we followed certain proposals, we would just be pushing the deadline, the cliff off by a year, right?

3078
04:46:49,576 --> 04:46:51,518
[SPEAKER_18]: And we need to make difficult decisions now.

3079
04:46:52,959 --> 04:46:56,222
[SPEAKER_18]: Very shortly, I think there are two core lessons that we've been hearing tonight.

3080
04:46:57,540 --> 04:46:59,881
[SPEAKER_18]: These lessons are why I would support this.

3081
04:46:59,941 --> 04:47:06,825
[SPEAKER_18]: The first one is being, you know, free cash should be used on one time expenses, rather than recurring because we can't count on them.

3082
04:47:07,145 --> 04:47:09,326
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't count on the number for the future.

3083
04:47:09,567 --> 04:47:11,468
[SPEAKER_18]: The second lesson being that, um,

3084
04:47:12,731 --> 04:47:20,173
[SPEAKER_18]: free cash needs to be certified, and oftentimes that process can take many, many months, usually until the spring, but we can't say for sure.

3085
04:47:21,073 --> 04:47:31,636
[SPEAKER_18]: God forbid something awful happens in our city that we need that free cash for, we need to put money into the Stable Legislation Fund for us to take, to be able to cover that expense, for us to fix that problem.

3086
04:47:32,237 --> 04:47:34,417
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we don't vote this through tonight, we don't have that money.

3087
04:47:34,657 --> 04:47:39,519
[SPEAKER_18]: So that problem could be left, we could be left out to dry for a very long time.

3088
04:47:41,989 --> 04:47:47,971
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think one additional note for the city council is that this actually gives us more say in how the money is spent as well.

3089
04:47:50,592 --> 04:47:54,054
[SPEAKER_18]: When we take money from the stabilization fund, the city council will have to approve that.

3090
04:47:54,314 --> 04:47:57,895
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that gives us an additional level of oversight that we haven't had before.

3091
04:47:58,035 --> 04:47:59,496
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm in support of this.

3092
04:47:59,536 --> 04:48:02,297
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why I seconded both the BPAPE and the paper.

3093
04:48:05,350 --> 04:48:05,590
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

3094
04:48:05,990 --> 04:48:06,771
[SPEAKER_21]: Any other questions.

3095
04:48:07,331 --> 04:48:11,774
[SPEAKER_21]: We probably should divide the question on the main paper I have to go to Councilor Callahan, Councilor Callahan my apologies.

3096
04:48:12,895 --> 04:48:13,215
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

3097
04:48:14,416 --> 04:48:20,560
[SPEAKER_32]: And thanks for, for all the work that you guys have done to put together these proposals.

3098
04:48:21,080 --> 04:48:24,983
[SPEAKER_32]: I wanted to ask a little bit about the capital stabilization fund.

3099
04:48:27,176 --> 04:48:47,401
[SPEAKER_32]: whether with the general stabilization fund, if that way that it is set up through the recommendations of the state, if that can be spent on capital, if the point of having a separate capital stabilization fund is to

3100
04:48:51,818 --> 04:48:55,621
[SPEAKER_32]: limit the ways that those funds can be spent.

3101
04:48:56,542 --> 04:49:04,609
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm trying to get to sort of why establish a capital stabilization fund separately from the general stabilization fund.

3102
04:49:04,669 --> 04:49:11,815
[SPEAKER_32]: And by the way, I am really glad that we're establishing a water and sewer capital stabilization fund, which we desperately need.

3103
04:49:11,855 --> 04:49:12,175
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

3104
04:49:12,195 --> 04:49:16,919
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Kelly and Councilor, Chief of Staff Nazarian.

3105
04:49:17,503 --> 04:49:20,345
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you very much, President Beres, through you to Councilor Callahan.

3106
04:49:20,365 --> 04:49:35,698
[SPEAKER_27]: I think the most succinct way for me to be able to respond to the question by you, Councilor Callahan, is to kind of go through some language that exists in, again, the Division of Local Services and their publications.

3107
04:49:36,418 --> 04:49:39,541
[SPEAKER_27]: They specifically write as to general stabilization funds.

3108
04:49:40,962 --> 04:49:54,352
[SPEAKER_27]: that communities established general stabilization funds as reserve accounts to provide emergency funds for use in major or significant events, such as a natural disaster and uninsured loss damage to a capital asset and it goes on.

3109
04:49:55,753 --> 04:49:57,434
[SPEAKER_27]: Specifically as to the question.

3110
04:49:57,454 --> 04:50:03,278
[SPEAKER_27]: It's really, it's really, it's creating two separate funds.

3111
04:50:04,457 --> 04:50:23,621
[SPEAKER_27]: really is an intention to show that the General Stabilization Fund are for the items that I just reviewed, and the Capital Stabilization Fund would be for capital-related projects, equipment and maintenance, and not intended to be things that would dip into the General Stabilization Fund.

3112
04:50:24,582 --> 04:50:30,323
[SPEAKER_27]: Hopefully I've answered the question that you had, and the goal would be, obviously, to

3113
04:50:32,170 --> 04:50:37,253
[SPEAKER_27]: maintain a capital stabilization fund that meets the city's needs into the longer term.

3114
04:50:37,673 --> 04:50:41,135
[SPEAKER_27]: But this is, again, another piece of a beginning part of the puzzle.

3115
04:50:43,576 --> 04:50:44,457
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

3116
04:50:47,218 --> 04:50:54,422
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further questions or comments on the creation of these stabilization funds and the appropriation of free cash funds to them?

3117
04:50:55,783 --> 04:50:56,924
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I apologize.

3118
04:50:56,984 --> 04:50:59,345
[SPEAKER_32]: Can I just do a short follow-up question?

3119
04:51:00,156 --> 04:51:08,168
[SPEAKER_32]: Do you have any data on how many municipalities or the percentage of municipalities that also have a capital stabilization fund?

3120
04:51:11,223 --> 04:51:12,984
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

3121
04:51:13,064 --> 04:51:32,900
[SPEAKER_27]: Through you to Councilor Callahan, I have some information and data as of approximately April of 2022 that states that at that time, the number of communities with at least one specific purpose stabilization fund had grown over the last five years at that time from 15% to close to 40%.

3122
04:51:33,641 --> 04:51:40,306
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't have the specific data as to how many communities right now have a capital stabilization fund, but I could certainly get back to the Council on that.

3123
04:51:40,643 --> 04:51:41,944
[SPEAKER_21]: But about in April 22 is 40%.

3124
04:51:42,164 --> 04:51:42,324
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

3125
04:51:42,424 --> 04:51:53,573
[SPEAKER_21]: And that includes towns of 100 and your tollens and your Florida's and your, I suspect, but yes, all 351 cities and towns.

3126
04:51:53,593 --> 04:51:53,734
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

3127
04:51:54,054 --> 04:51:54,574
[SPEAKER_27]: Across those.

3128
04:51:54,614 --> 04:51:54,794
[SPEAKER_27]: Yep.

3129
04:51:55,795 --> 04:51:56,456
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further questions?

3130
04:51:56,496 --> 04:51:57,076
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Calhoun?

3131
04:51:59,879 --> 04:52:01,360
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, I don't think so.

3132
04:52:02,461 --> 04:52:02,821
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

3133
04:52:03,834 --> 04:52:05,895
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, we'll take the B paper first.

3134
04:52:06,115 --> 04:52:12,156
[SPEAKER_21]: On the B paper by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

3135
04:52:13,596 --> 04:52:15,437
[SPEAKER_21]: And there will probably be four votes on this paper.

3136
04:52:15,457 --> 04:52:21,478
[SPEAKER_32]: I apologize, could you re-read the B motion, please?

3137
04:52:21,498 --> 04:52:31,241
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, yes, the re-paper motion, Councilor Callahan, is that we hold a committee of the whole with the administration to discuss and review the draft free cash plan.

3138
04:52:34,104 --> 04:52:34,404
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

3139
04:52:36,405 --> 04:52:36,585
[SPEAKER_39]: Great.

3140
04:52:36,605 --> 04:52:41,587
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Callahan?

3141

04:52:45,729 --> 04:52:46,730
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Callahan?

3143
04:52:47,030 --> 04:52:47,730
[SPEAKER_39]: That was a yes.

3144
04:52:48,430 --> 04:52:50,691
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Cartlidge?

3145
04:52:50,731 --> 04:52:51,031
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

3146
04:52:52,672 --> 04:52:53,813

[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

3152
04:53:05,925 --> 04:53:08,747
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, 60 from everyone absent the motion passes.

3153
04:53:10,188 --> 04:53:11,368
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we have the a paper.

3154
04:53:11,729 --> 04:53:15,891
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there a request to divide I think we should divide this into three votes, but I can't do that.

3155
04:53:16,492 --> 04:53:17,012
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess I could.

3156
04:53:18,193 --> 04:53:20,114
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Tseng is requested divided into three votes.

3157
04:53:20,695 --> 04:53:26,879
[SPEAKER_21]: So the first vote would be to appropriate $6 million in free cash to the General Stabilization Fund.

3158

[SPEAKER_21]: On that motion by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

3193
04:54:20,244 --> 04:54:21,184
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor San Buenaventura?

3194
04:54:21,204 --> 04:54:21,325
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

3195
04:54:21,405 --> 04:54:22,685
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor San Buenaventura?

3196
04:54:22,705 --> 04:54:22,765
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

3197
04:54:22,785 --> 04:54:23,766
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor San Buenaventura?

3198
04:54:23,786 --> 04:54:23,866
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

3199
04:54:23,886 --> 04:54:24,546
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor San Buenaventura?

3200
04:54:24,566 --> 04:54:24,627
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

3201
04:54:24,667 --> 04:54:27,468
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor San Buenaventura?

3202
04:54:27,508 --> 04:54:27,608
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

3203
04:54:27,628 --> 04:54:28,329
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor San Buenaventura?

3204
04:54:28,349 --> 04:54:28,449
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

3205
04:54:30,103 --> 04:54:31,323
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay, so this is 5 million.

3206
04:54:32,024 --> 04:54:37,205
[SPEAKER_21]: This is 5 million to establish the Capital Stabilization Fund and appropriate 5 million.

3207
04:54:37,225 --> 04:54:43,367
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Callahan?

3208
04:54:44,287 --> 04:54:44,528
[SPEAKER_39]: Yeah.

3209
04:54:48,529 --> 04:54:49,609
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Collins?

3210
04:54:50,269 --> 04:54:50,489
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

3211
04:54:51,490 --> 04:54:52,510
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Wazzara?

3212
04:54:52,790 --> 04:54:53,130
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

3213
04:54:54,271 --> 04:54:55,111
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Fleming?

3214
04:54:55,331 --> 04:54:55,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

3215
04:55:02,385 --> 04:55:02,885
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Tseng?

3216
04:55:03,706 --> 04:55:03,846
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

3217
04:55:03,866 --> 04:55:05,066
[SPEAKER_21]: 6 in the affirmative, 1 in the negative.

3218
04:55:05,606 --> 04:55:06,547
[SPEAKER_21]: The motion passes.

3219
04:55:07,007 --> 04:55:20,592
[SPEAKER_21]: And on the final question, on the motion of Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Tseng, to establish a water and sewer capital stabilization fund and vote to appropriate $2 million of retained earnings to this fund.

3220
04:55:21,852 --> 04:55:24,473
[SPEAKER_21]: When you're ready, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

3221
04:55:27,334 --> 04:55:27,855
[SPEAKER_21]: And we only have

3222
04:55:30,163 --> 04:55:31,945
[SPEAKER_21]: Three more papers to go.

3223
04:55:33,986 --> 04:55:40,552
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the water and sewer capital stabilization and the appropriation of $2 million in retained earnings.

3224
04:55:45,316 --> 04:55:45,656
Okay.

3225
04:55:55,765 --> 04:55:56,726
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Callahan.

3226
04:55:57,687 --> 04:55:57,807
Yes.

3227
04:56:00,303 --> 04:56:01,484
[SPEAKER_21]: We couldn't hear you Councilor Callahan.

3228
04:56:01,504 --> 04:56:01,605
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

3229
04:56:03,166 --> 04:56:03,406
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

3230
04:56:04,948 --> 04:56:05,168
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

3231
04:56:06,089 --> 04:56:06,289
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

3232
04:56:06,349 --> 04:56:06,409
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

3233
04:56:22,037 --> 04:56:26,058
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one in the negative, one absent, the motion passes.

3234
04:56:26,078 --> 04:56:31,280
[SPEAKER_21]: And we have established these savings accounts, appropriated funds to them.

3235
04:56:31,781 --> 04:56:33,041
[SPEAKER_21]: Those funds have not been spent.

3236
04:56:33,081 --> 04:56:43,465
[SPEAKER_21]: They just have simply been appropriated to accounts where the city can access them during the period between the start of the next fiscal year and when free cash and retained earnings are certified.

3237
04:56:44,485 --> 04:56:46,726
[SPEAKER_27]: May I just quickly congratulate

3238
04:56:47,958 --> 04:56:49,019
[SPEAKER_27]: and thank the council.

3239
04:56:49,059 --> 04:56:54,003
[SPEAKER_27]: I think this is a momentous opportunity that you've seized and we are very appreciative.

3240
04:56:54,123 --> 04:57:10,855
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, I don't wanna speak for our finance director, but this really is huge in terms of Medford's financial planning and the steps we've been trying to take to get ourselves to a place where we can try to see if we can increase our bond rating.

3241
04:57:11,175 --> 04:57:11,516
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

3242
04:57:11,796 --> 04:57:12,196
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

3243
04:57:15,663 --> 04:57:19,465
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you all know that I've been pushing for these stabilization funds since I got here.

3244
04:57:19,485 --> 04:57:21,786
[SPEAKER_17]: This is an appropriate use of free cash.

3245
04:57:22,447 --> 04:57:24,608
[SPEAKER_17]: These are funds for specific purposes.

3246
04:57:27,650 --> 04:57:33,153
[SPEAKER_17]: Practically every city and town in Massachusetts has them set up, so thank you very much.

3247
04:57:33,717 --> 04:57:34,117
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

3248
04:57:34,918 --> 04:57:40,300
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, we'll move to 24432, acceptance of shared service statute.

3249
04:57:40,360 --> 04:57:53,927
[SPEAKER_21]: Dear President Bears and members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body vote to accept the provisions of Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 71, Section 37M, which would allow the city to share services between municipal departments and the school department.

3250
04:57:54,327 --> 04:57:59,670
[SPEAKER_21]: As you'll see in the enclosed statute, the acceptance of the statute requires majority approval of the city council and the school committee.

3251
04:57:59,690 --> 04:58:01,171
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

3252
04:58:01,631 --> 04:58:03,032
[SPEAKER_21]: Sincerely, Brandolino Kern, Mayor.

3253
04:58:03,712 --> 04:58:04,373
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Chief of Staff.

3254
04:58:05,133 --> 04:58:06,014
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, President Bears.

3255
04:58:06,574 --> 04:58:14,501
[SPEAKER_27]: To you and members of the council, it's my understanding that the school committee voted yesterday evening to approve this by majority.

3256
04:58:14,881 --> 04:58:17,243
[SPEAKER_27]: It's my understanding it was a 5-2 vote of the school committee.

3257
04:58:19,025 --> 04:58:29,874
[SPEAKER_27]: The objective here is to use the acceptance of the statute to be able to utilize support on both city and school side where it makes sense, where it's practical.

3258
04:58:30,729 --> 04:58:34,691
[SPEAKER_27]: And so that's the simple nature of the question.

3259
04:58:34,851 --> 04:58:54,999
[SPEAKER_27]: If the council approves this ultimately, then the city and school departments can continue discussion on potentially instituting resources from either side of the organization to support the other side of the organization where it makes practical sense to do so based on the various circumstances of each concept.

3260
04:58:55,059 --> 04:58:55,379
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

3261
04:58:56,579 --> 04:58:56,819
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

3262
04:58:56,879 --> 04:58:57,560
[SPEAKER_21]: Any questions?

3263
04:58:57,600 --> 04:58:58,320
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

3264
04:58:59,292 --> 04:58:59,993
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, President Bears.

3265
04:59:00,013 --> 04:59:01,114
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you for presenting on this.

3266
04:59:01,935 --> 04:59:14,367
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm heartened to hear that the school committee already took a vote to approve this, not just because that's a step towards manifesting it, but also, you know, I would look to them to get the body's opinion on if this is a worthwhile endeavor.

3267
04:59:14,407 --> 04:59:17,831
[SPEAKER_29]: And it means a lot to me that the school committee, you know, the majority of them thought that this was

3268
04:59:20,239 --> 04:59:31,442
[SPEAKER_29]: worth moving forward and, you know, this does not, in my understanding, passage of this does not automatically, of course, it doesn't automatically consolidate any functions between the city and the schools department.

3269
04:59:32,602 --> 04:59:39,424
[SPEAKER_29]: What it does is it allows us to have those discussions about what functions might be advantageous to consolidate, might help us

3270
04:59:40,684 --> 04:59:54,187
[SPEAKER_29]: streamline things that both the cities and Metro Public Schools are doing might help us save money on things that we're currently doing in two places, would allow us to have those discussions and then be able to act on them if we come to decisions that some departments are worth combining.

3271
04:59:55,467 --> 04:59:57,608
[SPEAKER_29]: So I will be happy to approve this tonight.

3272
04:59:58,048 --> 04:59:58,368
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

3273
05:00:00,448 --> 05:00:00,948
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

3274
05:00:02,549 --> 05:00:03,229
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further questions?

3275
05:00:03,269 --> 05:00:03,809
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Tseng?

3276
05:00:05,810 --> 05:00:11,136
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm in favor of it for many of the reasons that Councilor Collins, Vice President Collins mentioned.

3277
05:00:11,456 --> 05:00:19,845
[SPEAKER_18]: I was curious if you had any clear departments or positions that you had in mind for now, or if those is just like a proactive.

3278
05:00:21,654 --> 05:00:35,600
[SPEAKER_27]: I would say that there are preliminary conversations that have been had, and I think there have been discussions as to certain departments that the city side could support potentially on the school side.

3279
05:00:36,001 --> 05:00:37,661
[SPEAKER_27]: They are very preliminary in nature.

3280
05:00:38,182 --> 05:00:49,847
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd be happy to speak with any counselor about it on the side, but I don't want to get out too far ahead of the conversations and put any party in a position that makes it challenging for them.

3281
05:00:50,792 --> 05:00:56,135
[SPEAKER_27]: I open the door for any councilor to contact me and I'm happy to speak to anyone and I'm happy to speak with the councilor.

3282
05:00:57,115 --> 05:01:10,642
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, and just from some discussions that I've had, my understanding is one of those areas would be facilities maintenance planning, which we have a need for and issues with across the city historically for decades.

3283
05:01:11,622 --> 05:01:16,525
[SPEAKER_21]: And so that's something I have heard talked about, but hopefully further discussion would be happening on that.

3284
05:01:19,656 --> 05:01:21,998
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, Councilor Callahan, I see your hand raised.

3285
05:01:32,000 --> 05:01:33,427
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, thank you.

3286
05:01:33,447 --> 05:01:38,872
[SPEAKER_21]: We will go to Vice President Collins.

3287
05:01:38,892 --> 05:01:39,572
[SPEAKER_28]: Motion to approve.

3288
05:01:44,085 --> 05:01:48,467
[SPEAKER_21]: on the motion to approve the standard service statute by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

3289
05:01:49,307 --> 05:01:50,728
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further discussion?

3290
05:01:53,809 --> 05:01:56,150
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing none, no hands on Zoom, no one at the podium.

3291

3293
05:02:05,074 --> 05:02:12,377
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Callahan, is that a yes?

3294
05:02:12,397 --> 05:02:13,138
[SPEAKER_21]: We really can't hear you.

3295
05:02:13,857 --> 05:02:15,378
[SPEAKER_21]: there might be something issue with your audio.

3296
05:02:16,158 --> 05:02:16,379
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

3297
05:02:18,720 --> 05:02:25,084
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Cahn, we're unable to hear you.

3298
05:02:25,104 --> 05:02:27,265

3299
05:02:29,086 --> 05:02:30,107
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Collins?

3300
05:02:31,468 --> 05:02:31,708
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

3301
05:02:31,728 --> 05:02:34,249

[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion to waive the rest of the reading.

05:03:38,769 --> 05:03:46,172
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion to waive the rest of the reading by Councilor Leming, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

3323
05:03:47,273 --> 05:03:48,934
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing as Councilor Keohokalole and I was unable to hear,

3324
05:03:49,594 --> 05:03:50,215
[SPEAKER_21]: go for.

3325
05:03:51,936 --> 05:03:52,737
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

3326
05:03:52,757 --> 05:03:53,337
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

3327
05:03:53,678 --> 05:03:54,218
[SPEAKER_21]: Opposed?

3328
05:03:54,939 --> 05:03:57,381
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes with two absences.

3329
05:03:58,182 --> 05:04:10,212
[SPEAKER_21]: The total amount here is, well there's no total at the bottom of this, but essentially these are end-of-year transfers from one account to another account to address minor deficits in those accounts.

3330
05:04:11,093 --> 05:04:12,955
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Chief of Staff or

3331
05:04:15,726 --> 05:04:28,418
[SPEAKER_21]: The only very large ones, there's facilities expenses, 200,000 coming from some other sources, workers' comp 200,000 coming from some other sources, and insurance expenses of one million coming from other sources.

3332
05:04:29,559 --> 05:04:33,923
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe we have discussed prior to this that the insurance expenses were higher than expected.

3333
05:04:34,444 --> 05:04:35,745
[SPEAKER_21]: With that, I will go to the Chief of Staff.

3334
05:04:36,462 --> 05:04:37,483
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, President Bears.

3335
05:04:37,523 --> 05:04:42,507
[SPEAKER_27]: Just to comment on the items you brought up, the facilities expenses largely were utilities expenses.

3336
05:04:43,567 --> 05:04:52,934
[SPEAKER_27]: As far as workers' comp salaries, it's just workers' compensation claims that were approved by our third-party workers' compensation organization.

3337
05:04:52,954 --> 05:04:59,079
[SPEAKER_27]: And you've already touched on the insurance expenses, but I'm happy to go into any further detail on any of those.

3338
05:04:59,979 --> 05:05:02,521
[SPEAKER_21]: Any questions from members of the council about the end of your transfers?

3339
05:05:05,023 --> 05:05:05,804
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

3340
05:05:06,547 --> 05:05:07,288
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, President Bears.

3341
05:05:07,308 --> 05:05:08,489
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you for walking us through these.

3342
05:05:08,869 --> 05:05:09,910
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't have any questions.

3343
05:05:09,990 --> 05:05:28,166
[SPEAKER_29]: I know from my two previous budget years, this is a standard, you know, set of loose threads to tie up at the end of the fiscal year, just to transfer unspent funds to other departments where there were additional funds that were budgeted for and balance things out that way.

3344
05:05:28,186 --> 05:05:29,987
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'd be happy to, motion to approve.

3345
05:05:30,348 --> 05:05:30,668
[SPEAKER_21]: Second.

3346
05:05:31,252 --> 05:05:36,497
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Leming, I just wanted to ask one question, Madam Chief of Staff.

3347
05:05:37,698 --> 05:05:50,269
[SPEAKER_21]: My understanding is that from the budget passed for fiscal 25 on June 11th, that the facilities budget for utilities, workers comp, and health insurance were increased given the actuals estimates.

3348
05:05:51,049 --> 05:05:52,871
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why those were higher, part of the reason those were higher.

3349
05:05:53,519 --> 05:05:55,200
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, those are my recollections.

3350
05:05:55,521 --> 05:06:05,328
[SPEAKER_27]: I would probably benefit from looking at the facilities budget again, because we would have liked to increase it even further, but as the council knows, but that is exactly my recollection as well.

3351
05:06:06,229 --> 05:06:14,235
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, at least we will be able to do that before free cash is certified next year, because we have a stabilization fund.

3352
05:06:15,899 --> 05:06:24,765
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, on the motion of Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Leming, to approve the fiscal year 24 end of year transfers, 24-433.

3353
05:06:24,805 --> 05:06:32,650
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, and it looks like we do have Councilor Callahan back, so we'll try that again.

3354
05:06:32,670 --> 05:06:33,971
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

3355
05:06:35,432 --> 05:06:36,332
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Callahan.

3356
05:06:37,153 --> 05:06:37,413
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes.

3357
05:06:39,094 --> 05:06:40,235
[SPEAKER_19]: We heard you loud and clear.

3358
05:06:41,776 --> 05:06:42,036
[SPEAKER_38]: Great.

3359
05:06:43,257 --> 05:06:43,437
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

3360
05:06:46,531 --> 05:06:46,791
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

3361
05:06:48,672 --> 05:06:48,872
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

3362
05:06:55,137 --> 05:06:55,497
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

3363
05:06:55,517 --> 05:07:07,826
[SPEAKER_21]: 60 affirmative one absent the motion passes 24-434 the end of a long road offered by Mayor Brando-Lingo Kern proposed wage adjustment for non-union personnel.

3364
05:07:09,431 --> 05:07:29,061
[SPEAKER_21]: Dear President Bears and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend the City Council approve the following amendment to the revised ordinances, Chapter 66, Entitled Personnel, Article II, Entitled Reserve, the City's Classification and Compensation Plan, formally included as Article II, Section 6631-6640, by adopting the following changes.

3365
05:07:29,101 --> 05:07:35,964
[SPEAKER_21]: Amendment A, non-union personnel, effective January 1, 2024, increase the base salary of all non-union titles by 1%,

3366
05:07:37,185 --> 05:07:55,054
[SPEAKER_21]: effective july 1 2024 increase the base salary of all non-union titles by two percent i further request and recommend that calf 22 the mayor's position being excluded from the cost of living adjustments cola afforded to the non-union personnel between 2021 and 2024 and something less than the general two percent increases be made to calf 2022

3367
05:07:56,255 --> 05:07:58,536
[SPEAKER_21]: such as a mix of 0% and 1% increases.

3368
05:07:58,576 --> 05:08:00,337
[SPEAKER_21]: Suggested increases would be 1,120, 0%, 1,121, 1%, 1,122, 1%, 1,123, 1%, 1,124, 0%, 7,124, 1%,

3369
05:08:12,183 --> 05:08:14,184
[SPEAKER_21]: there'll be a total of a 4% increase.

3370
05:08:15,185 --> 05:08:21,988
[SPEAKER_21]: There has been no increase to the salary for the position of mayor since 7-1-2014 for 10 years.

3371
05:08:22,569 --> 05:08:25,991
[SPEAKER_21]: The following is a table of the historical COLA's attributed to CAF 22.

3372
05:08:26,671 --> 05:08:30,573
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, this just shows that it went up by 2.5% in 2013, 2% in 2014, and then has not increased since 7-1-2014.

3373
05:08:37,797 --> 05:08:43,499
[SPEAKER_21]: Amendment B, the language of CAF 19 shall be amended to include the following position, human resources director.

3374
05:08:44,099 --> 05:08:58,443
[SPEAKER_21]: Amendment C, per the council's request, the language of CAF 21 shall be amended to remove the following position, and a new classification of CAF 21.5 be created to include the following position as per the below table, which takes into account the above cost of living increases.

3375
05:08:58,943 --> 05:09:00,004
[SPEAKER_21]: Quote, city solicitor,

3376
05:09:01,218 --> 05:09:01,758
[SPEAKER_21]: Step one, $138,648.89.

3377
05:09:01,798 --> 05:09:02,519
[SPEAKER_21]: Step two, $143,683.59.

3378
05:09:02,559 --> 05:09:02,979
[SPEAKER_21]: Step three, $148,901.12.

3379
05:09:03,019 --> 05:09:03,219
[SPEAKER_21]: Step four, $154,308.11.

3380
05:09:03,339 --> 05:09:03,599
[SPEAKER_21]: Step five, $159,911.99.

3381
05:09:24,267 --> 05:09:25,048
[SPEAKER_21]: and 44 cents.

3382
05:09:25,088 --> 05:09:26,449
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

3383
05:09:26,969 --> 05:09:28,050
[SPEAKER_21]: So let's take these in order.

3384
05:09:28,490 --> 05:09:38,938
[SPEAKER_21]: First, we have Amendment A, non-union personnel, effective January 1, an increase of 1% to the base salary, effective July 1, an increase of 2% to the base salary.

3385
05:09:38,958 --> 05:09:45,984
[SPEAKER_21]: The mayor has requested that the mayor's position be excluded and that some other amount other than those two amounts be included.

3386
05:09:46,735 --> 05:09:49,378
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll go to Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro.

3387
05:09:50,178 --> 05:09:52,961
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, could we get a presentation from the Chief of Staff before questions?

3388
05:09:53,562 --> 05:09:55,884
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Chief of Staff, Councilor Collins, Councilor Lazzaro.

3389
05:09:56,633 --> 05:09:58,454
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, President Bears, members of the council.

3390
05:09:59,514 --> 05:10:05,656
[SPEAKER_27]: If acceptable to you, President Bears and the council, shall I go through all three amendments very quickly at a high level?

3391
05:10:05,936 --> 05:10:06,957
[SPEAKER_21]: Could we take them one at a time?

3392
05:10:07,097 --> 05:10:07,437
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely.

3393
05:10:07,457 --> 05:10:10,618
[SPEAKER_27]: My brain is- Yes, yes, I just wanted to make sure I understood the plan.

3394
05:10:11,118 --> 05:10:21,902
[SPEAKER_27]: As far as amendment A is concerned, the first section as it relates to the non-union personnel that has the bulleted items discussing the effective dates and the proposed COLA increases, those are

3395
05:10:23,362 --> 05:10:33,645
[SPEAKER_27]: Essentially, cost of living increases somewhat consistent with how we have presented non-union cost of living increases in the past, essentially 2% is what would be the calculus there.

3396
05:10:35,066 --> 05:10:38,607
[SPEAKER_27]: The 1% that's proposed in January 2024 is because the

3397
05:10:41,055 --> 05:10:59,903
[SPEAKER_27]: Cost of living increases historically for especially non-union and some other units have been effective January 1, but with our new human resources director who's trying to align everything in more comfortable and clear and concise patterns, we are trying to move everything to a July 1 date in terms of COLAs.

3398
05:10:59,943 --> 05:11:02,605
[SPEAKER_27]: And we've seen that consistent in some of the

3399
05:11:03,385 --> 05:11:06,666
[SPEAKER_27]: collective bargaining agreements that have come before this council that this council has approved.

3400
05:11:07,747 --> 05:11:16,151
[SPEAKER_27]: So the 1% is just a split the year to say we acknowledge that, you know, there was a six month period of time and here's that split compensation and then there's the 2%.

3401
05:11:16,191 --> 05:11:16,671
[SPEAKER_27]: As far as the

3402
05:11:19,272 --> 05:11:27,297
[SPEAKER_27]: Additional commentary as it relates to CAF 22, the mayor's position, as you probably all know, the mayor didn't do any advocacy on this.

3403
05:11:27,317 --> 05:11:35,281
[SPEAKER_27]: She hasn't contacted any of you to discuss and advocate for this aspect of this portion of the paper.

3404
05:11:35,321 --> 05:11:42,025
[SPEAKER_27]: She just wanted to make sure that it was excluded to acknowledge that it not necessarily received the

3405
05:11:42,705 --> 05:11:52,277
[SPEAKER_27]: historical 2, 2, and 2 that was approved by this council going back maybe a year ago at this point, plus this 1 and 2 proposing lesser amounts.

3406
05:11:53,278 --> 05:11:55,441
[SPEAKER_27]: Please do whatever the council sees fit on that.

3407
05:11:57,904 --> 05:11:58,164
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

3408
05:11:58,224 --> 05:11:59,886
[SPEAKER_21]: On Amendment A, Vice President Collins.

3409
05:11:59,926 --> 05:12:01,168
[SPEAKER_21]: Council Lizarra, Vice President Collins.

3410
05:12:02,383 --> 05:12:03,283
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, President Bears.

3411
05:12:03,303 --> 05:12:04,584
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you so much for the presentation.

3412
05:12:04,604 --> 05:12:07,625
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm happy to see this before us.

3413
05:12:08,246 --> 05:12:18,330
[SPEAKER_29]: I am always pleased for the opportunity to give any member of city personnel a raise, no matter whether they are union or non-union.

3414
05:12:18,370 --> 05:12:19,731
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that everybody deserves raises.

3415
05:12:19,811 --> 05:12:24,773
[SPEAKER_29]: Everybody deserves cost of living adjustments, and it's not a zero-sum situation.

3416
05:12:24,813 --> 05:12:26,294
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm always happy to approve raises.

3417
05:12:29,154 --> 05:12:33,156
[SPEAKER_29]: I would motion to approve the amendment put forward.

3418
05:12:33,256 --> 05:12:44,441
[SPEAKER_29]: I would motion to exclude CAF 22, the mayor's position from the COLA afforded to non-use and personnel between 2021 and 2024.

3419
05:12:44,881 --> 05:12:47,763
[SPEAKER_29]: But beyond that, that is the only exclusion I would make.

3420
05:12:47,783 --> 05:12:52,725
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of Vice President Collins, excuse me, excuse me, thank you.

3421
05:12:52,745 --> 05:12:56,527
[SPEAKER_21]: I will call on you when it is my time to call on you and you will wait until I do so.

3422
05:12:58,183 --> 05:13:06,810
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lazzaro, after I just reviewed the motion, there's a motion on the floor from Vice President Collins to approve Amendment A while excluding CAF 22.

3423
05:13:07,930 --> 05:13:09,792
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President, sorry, Councilor Lazzaro.

3424
05:13:11,913 --> 05:13:16,377
[SPEAKER_29]: I need a correction, that excluding CAF 22 only from the raises made between 2021 and 2024.

3425
05:13:16,637 --> 05:13:22,161
[SPEAKER_29]: That this is only proposing January 1 and July 1, 2024?

3426
05:13:28,348 --> 05:13:31,831
[SPEAKER_21]: So are you excluding, I'm confused by what you're saying.

3427
05:13:32,111 --> 05:13:33,532
[SPEAKER_29]: I think maybe I'm confused by the wording.

3428
05:13:34,053 --> 05:13:38,396
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, everything below the 2% bullet point is not part of this.

3429
05:13:43,080 --> 05:13:45,482
[SPEAKER_29]: This amendment makes no changes to.

3430
05:13:50,586 --> 05:13:51,027
[SPEAKER_19]: This amendment.

3431
05:13:51,067 --> 05:13:52,608
[SPEAKER_29]: Cap changes made prior to 2024.

3432
05:13:55,017 --> 05:13:56,918
[SPEAKER_21]: would not be applied.

3433
05:13:57,238 --> 05:14:04,240
[SPEAKER_21]: All of this amendment does is proposes non-union personnel to get 1% on January 1, 2024 and 2% on July 1, 2024.

3434
05:14:05,021 --> 05:14:05,201
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

3435
05:14:05,901 --> 05:14:08,942
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the mayor has asked if we want to include some amount for the mayor.

3436
05:14:09,422 --> 05:14:12,663
[SPEAKER_21]: If we exclude CAF 22, then they're excluded from those two races.

3437
05:14:12,683 --> 05:14:14,024
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, I would like to amend my motion.

3438
05:14:14,484 --> 05:14:14,784
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

3439
05:14:14,844 --> 05:14:16,465
[SPEAKER_29]: I would like to approve the amendment.

3440
05:14:17,405 --> 05:14:18,285
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to include 1-121, 1-122, 1-123,

3441
05:14:23,484 --> 05:14:23,884
[SPEAKER_21]: and seven.

3442
05:14:24,044 --> 05:14:28,667
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to include the mayor's cap 22 in in January one in July one.

3443
05:14:30,208 --> 05:14:30,408
[SPEAKER_39]: Yeah.

3444
05:14:31,069 --> 05:14:31,349
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

3445
05:14:31,769 --> 05:14:36,152
[SPEAKER_21]: So you want to approve amendment a with no exclusion of the mayor.

3446
05:14:36,392 --> 05:14:36,712
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

3447
05:14:38,233 --> 05:14:43,396
[SPEAKER_37]: Council is our um, thank you for presenting this.

3448
05:14:43,877 --> 05:14:45,618
[SPEAKER_37]: Um, I

3449
05:14:46,610 --> 05:14:49,111
[SPEAKER_37]: agree with what Vice President Collins said.

3450
05:14:49,612 --> 05:15:05,621
[SPEAKER_37]: I just wanted to say that it is a difficult thing to present, especially after a decade of no cost of living increase.

3451
05:15:06,662 --> 05:15:08,783
[SPEAKER_37]: It's difficult as a

3452
05:15:12,054 --> 05:15:15,477
[SPEAKER_37]: head of a city to propose that you give yourself a raise.

3453
05:15:16,738 --> 05:15:24,424
[SPEAKER_37]: The reason I am in favor of this is because our current mayor will not be our current mayor forever.

3454
05:15:24,804 --> 05:15:35,452
[SPEAKER_37]: And it's the same reason that I was in favor of the raises for our school committee members, which is that every subsequent person that will

3455
05:15:36,055 --> 05:15:39,816
[SPEAKER_37]: become the mayor will have to live on a salary.

3456
05:15:39,836 --> 05:15:49,917
[SPEAKER_37]: And we can't have that position only available to people who are able to live on a salary that is not a living wage.

3457
05:15:52,638 --> 05:15:57,119
[SPEAKER_37]: It precludes people who are not independently wealthy.

3458
05:15:57,219 --> 05:16:03,980
[SPEAKER_37]: So if the person who would like to run for mayor at some future time,

3459
05:16:06,496 --> 05:16:10,898
[SPEAKER_37]: they will need to live in Medford, they will need to be able to afford it, and this is what will be required.

3460
05:16:11,018 --> 05:16:13,139
[SPEAKER_37]: So going forward, we'll have to make these adjustments.

3461
05:16:16,741 --> 05:16:18,122
[SPEAKER_37]: This is just what we have to do.

3462
05:16:19,395 --> 05:16:26,540
[SPEAKER_37]: And I appreciate the willingness to put that forward for now and for everybody who will hold these positions in the future.

3463
05:16:28,021 --> 05:16:32,343
[SPEAKER_37]: It's challenging because it feels weird, but it's something that we have to do.

3464
05:16:32,524 --> 05:16:33,484
[SPEAKER_37]: So I'm in support of it.

3465
05:16:33,584 --> 05:16:38,587
[SPEAKER_37]: And as Vice President Collins said, I'm also in favor of giving people raises.

3466
05:16:39,868 --> 05:16:40,208
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

3467
05:16:41,329 --> 05:16:42,570
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming.

3468
05:16:45,427 --> 05:16:57,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of this that gives me pause is the fact that Medford, the mayor's chair of the school committee and so I mean I know that that's two different positions but by two legally different positions.

3469
05:16:58,554 --> 05:17:02,576
[SPEAKER_11]: I, yeah, I, I know but the.

3470
05:17:04,183 --> 05:17:19,457
[SPEAKER_11]: it could change if the charter changes, but effectively the person who is occupying both the position as mayor and the position as head of the school committee in Medford are the same person.

3471
05:17:19,517 --> 05:17:27,904
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the chair of the school committee did get a raise already.

3472
05:17:27,964 --> 05:17:28,545
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's,

3473
05:17:30,649 --> 05:17:41,762
[SPEAKER_11]: That's I'd say that I'd say that that's the part that that's that's the one part of this that does give me that does give me some pause the logic of having not received an increase in the past.

3474
05:17:42,985 --> 05:17:46,289
[SPEAKER_11]: 10 years, that does make sense.

3475
05:17:46,329 --> 05:17:58,642
[SPEAKER_11]: But the person who is essentially doing the job that they have done that whole time has received a raise that we approved.

3476
05:17:58,762 --> 05:18:04,047
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the only part of this that I'm questioning right now.

3477
05:18:08,860 --> 05:18:10,282
[SPEAKER_18]: Any further comments, Councilor Tseng?

3478
05:18:11,243 --> 05:18:23,035
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to say I'm still making my mind up, but to your point, if you're thinking about it that way, then we should recognize that the raised cost for the school committee is basically just a little bit over 2% over those last almost 20 years.

3479
05:18:23,055 --> 05:18:23,115
[SPEAKER_18]: And

3480
05:18:28,115 --> 05:18:31,198
[SPEAKER_18]: it's off of a baseline that's much smaller, right?

3481
05:18:31,319 --> 05:18:33,761
[SPEAKER_18]: And so it's still 2%, right?

3482
05:18:34,061 --> 05:18:41,630
[SPEAKER_18]: And she's still doing whoever the mayor is, the mayor, whoever serves in that position is still doing those two legally separate roles.

3483
05:18:41,690 --> 05:18:45,213
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you're thinking about it like that, I would just urge you to

3484
05:18:46,369 --> 05:18:54,051
[SPEAKER_18]: use that logic to apply if I don't know if I'm making sense to you, but I'm just saying the baseline, the base number is different.

3485
05:18:54,271 --> 05:19:01,114
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, you know, whilst we can say that the chair of the school committee did receive a raise.

3486
05:19:02,901 --> 05:19:12,287
[SPEAKER_18]: we should think of that as separate from the mayoral role, because they are just two completely separate entities with two completely different salaries.

3487
05:19:14,328 --> 05:19:15,209
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just putting that out there.

3488
05:19:15,229 --> 05:19:21,212
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm still making my mind up on it, but if I'm understanding your line of thinking, I would urge you to think that way as well.

3489
05:19:23,474 --> 05:19:23,954
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

3490
05:19:24,054 --> 05:19:24,895
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Callahan.

3491
05:19:26,235 --> 05:19:26,616
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

3492
05:19:26,636 --> 05:19:26,996
[SPEAKER_32]: So,

3493
05:19:29,901 --> 05:19:34,744
[SPEAKER_32]: I guess I have a second, I hesitate on two points.

3494
05:19:35,625 --> 05:19:43,570
[SPEAKER_32]: One is that I think that the cost of living in Medford is going up more than 2%.

3495
05:19:43,610 --> 05:19:45,792
[SPEAKER_32]: So for non-union employees,

3496
05:19:50,967 --> 05:19:56,969
[SPEAKER_32]: you know, my general understanding of salaries in Medford is that they are across the board too low.

3497
05:19:57,269 --> 05:20:09,232
[SPEAKER_32]: And I do look forward to us receiving and reviewing the overview of how we compare to nearby cities.

3498
05:20:10,952 --> 05:20:16,554
[SPEAKER_32]: But, you know, I mean, I'm happy to give a raise, but I also hesitate to give

3499
05:20:18,056 --> 05:20:19,317
[SPEAKER_32]: This to me is not a raise, right?

3500
05:20:19,437 --> 05:20:21,319
[SPEAKER_32]: It's clearly not a raise, it's a COLA.

3501
05:20:21,959 --> 05:20:30,245
[SPEAKER_32]: But even at a COLA, I would like to see us being commensurate with other cities.

3502
05:20:32,487 --> 05:20:38,171
[SPEAKER_32]: And then secondly, also, I'm not totally convinced that

3503
05:20:41,445 --> 05:20:52,071
[SPEAKER_32]: As well, looking, you know, I, I probably should spend a little time reviewing mayor salaries and nearby cities of similar size and all those things.

3504
05:20:53,011 --> 05:20:54,672
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't think you simply say it's 2%.

3505
05:20:55,052 --> 05:20:58,034
[SPEAKER_32]: I also don't think that the

3506
05:20:58,514 --> 05:21:09,438
[SPEAKER_32]: current pay of the person who sits in the mayor's chair, given the two positions that they are legally required to sit in, and the pay that they get from both of those is not a living wage.

3507
05:21:09,878 --> 05:21:11,138
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't think that can be argued.

3508
05:21:12,959 --> 05:21:16,400
[SPEAKER_32]: So I do have two points of hesitation on this one.

3509
05:21:16,420 --> 05:21:20,241
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

3510
05:21:20,341 --> 05:21:21,582
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further questions?

3511
05:21:24,428 --> 05:21:29,053
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a motion on the floor from Vice President Collins to approve with no exclusions.

3512
05:21:29,994 --> 05:21:33,819
[SPEAKER_21]: Seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

3513
05:21:35,320 --> 05:21:38,364
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing no further questions, I will go to the podium.

3514
05:21:39,705 --> 05:21:40,706
[SPEAKER_21]: Name and address for the record, please.

3515
05:21:40,726 --> 05:21:41,487
[SPEAKER_21]: You have three minutes.

3516
05:21:44,838 --> 05:21:47,759
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Steve South, 106 Damon Road.

3517
05:21:48,959 --> 05:21:52,020
[SPEAKER_44]: One of the councilors just said that everybody deserves a raise.

3518
05:21:52,920 --> 05:21:57,922
[SPEAKER_44]: I just want to point out some facts to the council as you consider this paper before you.

3519
05:21:58,842 --> 05:22:07,485
[SPEAKER_44]: One is the hardworking police in the city of Medford, both the Patrolmen's Union and the police superior officers,

3520
05:22:08,365 --> 05:22:11,627
[SPEAKER_44]: Their contract expired June 30, 2022.

3521
05:22:12,047 --> 05:22:16,410
[SPEAKER_44]: They haven't had a raise since July 1 of 2021, that's three years.

3522
05:22:17,271 --> 05:22:20,873
[SPEAKER_44]: The parking department in the city of Medford was created in January of 2022.

3523
05:22:21,133 --> 05:22:27,257
[SPEAKER_44]: There's about 10 or 11 people that work in that department.

3524
05:22:27,557 --> 05:22:29,138
[SPEAKER_44]: They haven't had a raise since then.

3525
05:22:29,178 --> 05:22:34,482
[SPEAKER_44]: They're still in contract negotiations and the city's taking a hard line in those negotiations.

3526
05:22:35,262 --> 05:22:41,248
[SPEAKER_44]: The inspectors, DPW, superintendents, and recreation department, their contract expired June 30, 2021.

3527
05:22:41,709 --> 05:22:45,232
[SPEAKER_44]: They haven't had a raise since July 1 of 2020.

3528
05:22:45,312 --> 05:22:49,557
[SPEAKER_44]: That's four years for all of those folks.

3529
05:22:50,618 --> 05:22:52,860
[SPEAKER_44]: We were in years of negotiations.

3530
05:22:53,641 --> 05:22:54,902
[SPEAKER_44]: Then went to mediation.

3531
05:22:55,102 --> 05:23:02,347
[SPEAKER_44]: Again, the city's taking a very hard line asking for humongous financial concessions from those members.

3532
05:23:02,908 --> 05:23:07,491
[SPEAKER_44]: And I do like what Councilor Callahan said, that 2% is too low.

3533
05:23:07,871 --> 05:23:10,914
[SPEAKER_44]: Well, they're looking to give in that range of raises.

3534
05:23:11,474 --> 05:23:16,035
[SPEAKER_44]: but huge concessions of monies that they already make.

3535
05:23:16,515 --> 05:23:19,276
[SPEAKER_44]: Obviously that's unacceptable.

3536
05:23:19,836 --> 05:23:30,138
[SPEAKER_44]: And I just wanna point out a couple things while you look at the total picture is you just approved a $3 million study for the high school.

3537
05:23:31,238 --> 05:23:32,839
[SPEAKER_44]: You're creating new positions.

3538
05:23:32,919 --> 05:23:38,860
[SPEAKER_44]: I talked about earlier, 118,000 for a new assistant DPW director position.

3539
05:23:39,440 --> 05:23:51,049
[SPEAKER_44]: you're obviously you're gonna approve these raises for the non-union, including the non-union really means all the mayor's top staff or department heads and the inner circle of the mayor.

3540
05:23:51,169 --> 05:23:53,371
[SPEAKER_44]: So that's who you're giving these raises to.

3541
05:23:53,391 --> 05:23:57,554
[SPEAKER_44]: We talked about the $34 million in free cash.

3542
05:23:58,095 --> 05:24:06,721
[SPEAKER_44]: And lastly, I just want to reiterate that the school committee, not only did you approve a humongous raise for Monday,

3543
05:24:07,882 --> 05:24:15,526
[SPEAKER_44]: If I remember correctly, you approved another humongous raise for one year from Monday for the school committee.

3544
05:24:15,606 --> 05:24:25,190
[SPEAKER_44]: So two huge raises while you're trying to take concessions from the union groups, the administration that you work with every day.

3545
05:24:25,511 --> 05:24:27,051
[SPEAKER_44]: So that's it.

3546
05:24:27,331 --> 05:24:34,275
[SPEAKER_44]: I'd ask you to vote no on these raises until you respect the hardworking police

3547
05:24:35,435 --> 05:24:41,416
[SPEAKER_44]: the hardworking parking department, the DPW superintendents, the recreation department, and the inspectors.

3548
05:24:41,436 --> 05:24:41,837
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

3549
05:24:41,977 --> 05:24:42,497
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

3550
05:24:43,477 --> 05:24:45,937
[SPEAKER_21]: Any further comment from members of the public on this matter?

3551
05:24:45,957 --> 05:24:57,460
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing none, there's a motion on the floor by Vice President Collins to approve with no exclusions.

3552
05:24:57,580 --> 05:24:58,960
[SPEAKER_21]: Seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

3553
05:24:59,981 --> 05:25:01,061
[SPEAKER_21]: So for amendment A,

3554
05:25:03,700 --> 05:25:04,961
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

3555
05:25:05,001 --> 05:25:05,881
[SPEAKER_21]: This is 24 434 Amendment A. No.

3556
05:25:05,901 --> 05:25:06,102
[SPEAKER_21]: So no.

3557
05:25:06,122 --> 05:25:06,202
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

3558
05:25:06,242 --> 05:25:06,362
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

3559
05:25:35,918 --> 05:25:50,192
