Shelly is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:16,232 --> 00:00:18,973
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:19,613 --> 00:00:21,334
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:22,594 --> 00:00:29,295
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:33,396
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:35,877
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:43,932 --> 00:00:45,833
All right, thanks so much for being with me today.

10
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:49,674
If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name, pronouns and who you are.

11
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:50,755
For sure.

12
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:51,395
Happy to be here.

13
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:52,516
So my name is John Antapa.

14
00:00:52,576 --> 00:00:53,636
You see him pronouns.

15
00:00:54,456 --> 00:01:00,879
I am a current Medford School Committee candidate running for technically free election.

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:09,023
And I am looking forward to continue doing all the work that we've been doing on the school committee.

17
00:01:10,644 --> 00:01:13,426
I am from North Medford, born and raised in the Heights.

18
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:20,372
I was part of the, pretty much as many things I could get my hands on while in the Medford public schools.

19
00:01:20,912 --> 00:01:33,943
I, you know, was an art student, did the arts for as long as I could, athletics for as long as I could, and really had a blast sort of learning all of the community elements that popped up in both, you know,

20
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,856
Student activism and the arts and athletics.

21
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:49,031
And then after high school, I went to get my bachelor's of fine arts and industrial design at the Masters College of Art and Design, where I currently work for my quote unquote day job.

22
00:01:49,553 --> 00:02:01,545
I work in the student engagement office where I deal with student activities, family and friends, orientation, student organizations, and civic engagement and veterans, veteran affairs.

23
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:10,034
So it's a, you know, dealing with people and working all the people to establish community and to really problem solve and figure things out.

24
00:02:10,753 --> 00:02:19,321
Um, has been a common, uh, goal amongst my time, both in higher ed, uh, working in higher ed, being educated in higher ed and on the school committee.

25
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:21,303
Um, so yeah, that's me.

26
00:02:21,844 --> 00:02:24,887
Um, and I'm just, like I said, I'm happy to be here and happy to have a chat and conversation.

27
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,361
Yeah, it sounds like there's a there's some really helpful overlap in the day job and then also your responsibilities on school committee.

28
00:02:33,462 --> 00:02:45,445
So before we get into talking too much about your school committee stuff, probably the most entertaining, least important, most fun question of the podcast is what is your favorite place to eat in Medford?

29
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,265
What do you like to eat there?

30
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:50,406
So last time I was here, you know, I can't believe it's almost been two years already.

31
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:54,867
I talked a lot about, you know, food allergies and finding places to eat.

32
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:59,370
I can say that since we've last talked, I have found my favorite at the Ford.

33
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,513
It has been the Cajun Chicken Alfredo.

34
00:03:03,573 --> 00:03:05,034
That has been my go-to there.

35
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:09,518
And I'm also loving their new location, Mrs. Murphy's Pub.

36
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:10,759
I've been loving that a lot.

37
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:16,844
I did fail to recognize Goldilocks, because Goldilocks is my go-to Friday place.

38
00:03:17,184 --> 00:03:18,625
They're also phenomenal with allergies.

39
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:25,111
really like the they're the only specifically bagel place that I can go to safely.

40
00:03:25,191 --> 00:03:26,212
And I love the staff.

41
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:27,673
I love the folks over there.

42
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:30,615
So that's kind of my Friday commute into work.

43
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:33,718
I wake up, you know, a little bit earlier just to make sure I can get there.

44
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:38,461
But otherwise, you know, the classics of I just love trying to get to as many of those.

45
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:49,202
family-owned places as much as I can because, like I said, two years ago, they employ our students and also, like, they're amazing with allergies and it's just the greatest vibe.

46
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:55,605
I'm a talker and I love having conversation and learning what they're up to and just seeing, you know, how things are going.

47
00:03:57,246 --> 00:03:57,986
Those are my favorite places.

48
00:03:58,106 --> 00:04:00,708
Also, Magnificent Muffins has the best, I think,

49
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:04,256
local business coffee that I've ever had.

50
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:06,377
They're really good.

51
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:13,861
I don't get many of the muffins because of my allergy, but I always stop there for coffee to say hi to Joan and the gang and, you know, talk to them and see what's going on.

52
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:15,388
I got to try that.

53
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:19,612
I think there's still cash only, I think, and I've never have cash, but maybe I'll make it a point to do that.

54
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:25,297
I have a funny story about Mrs. Murphy's, though, because I feel like, you know, last time we talked there, some of these places weren't open yet.

55
00:04:25,477 --> 00:04:25,637
Right.

56
00:04:26,538 --> 00:04:32,243
But I do frequent Mrs. Murphy's more than maybe I should be proud of.

57
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:39,370
But I on Fridays, I have my like, I take care of my niece and she's like, since she was like, really small and

58
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:42,652
she so I bring her in there.

59
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:45,413
She used to be like, like a little baby in the car seat, whatever.

60
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:50,034
And one Friday, I was there like, in the afternoon, and she was there with me.

61
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:52,795
And one of the servers was like, Oh, she's getting so big.

62
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:56,397
I gotta stop.

63
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:57,497
They know me and the baby.

64
00:04:57,677 --> 00:04:58,897
That's awesome.

65
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:00,058
Great place, though.

66
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:05,603
It is my it's funny because you know, like I'm seeing it go from Medford electronics to then.

67
00:05:06,204 --> 00:05:08,186
So my dad actually was one of the painter.

68
00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:08,787
He was the painter.

69
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:09,828
He painted the interior.

70
00:05:09,848 --> 00:05:17,055
And so seeing it go from Medford electronics to what it is, and then like, they have outside seating in the back, which is also crazy to be like,

71
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:19,939
in sandwiched in between all these storefronts.

72
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:28,925
Like it feels really weird and you don't realize it until you look up and you see the brick buildings and you're like, oh, I'm in the middle of the square where I didn't think I would ever set foot.

73
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:32,367
Yeah, so that's awesome though.

74
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:33,548
That's great.

75
00:05:34,736 --> 00:05:38,779
But well, we could just talk about I know, but we'll we'll move on.

76
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,920
So you know what?

77
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:47,606
I think in your comments in the beginning, you were referring to how you when you ran last time, you were like the runner up for school committee.

78
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:51,950
But then when Melanie McLaughlin stepped down, you were the closest in vote.

79
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,412
So that's how you are on the school committee now, which still counts.

80
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:54,992
John does.

81
00:05:55,152 --> 00:05:55,993
Yeah, I know it counts.

82
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:56,874
I know.

83
00:05:56,914 --> 00:05:59,256
But we've been joking and you know, in the family of like,

84
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:02,139
Oh, should I put reelect stickers on the signs?

85
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:05,943
And we're like, well, like, technically you were, but technically you weren't.

86
00:06:05,963 --> 00:06:10,547
So like, I think I think the papers say candidate for renomination.

87
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:11,508
And I like that.

88
00:06:11,549 --> 00:06:12,670
That's the phrase I've been using.

89
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,471
That works.

90
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:14,071
That works.

91
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:15,952
That makes sense.

92
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:17,993
Well, so yeah, I'm so curious how it's gone.

93
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:24,014
Like I think how is I, you know, when we talked two years ago, you, this was your second, that would have been your second time running.

94
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:30,396
Um, and I think before you're actually doing the job, you probably have like an idea of how it'll go.

95
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:33,377
And I'm sure that doesn't totally match how it actually is.

96
00:06:33,437 --> 00:06:35,117
So I'm curious, like, how has it gone?

97
00:06:35,617 --> 00:06:36,478
What are you proud of?

98
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:37,598
What do you want to reflect on?

99
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:38,638
Yeah, no.

100
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,459
So I, you know, it was a whirlwind.

101
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,640
I mean, that whole time of, um,

102
00:06:45,412 --> 00:07:01,543
I mean, in my personal life, it was also a kind of time I had just gotten a second contract at MassArt, so I was a contract employee actually seeking my full-time job, which I got, and at the same time was also a contract employee in the housing department as sort of an on-call support for their resident assistants.

103
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,172
And so at that same time, you know, I just accepted that contract.

104
00:07:05,332 --> 00:07:07,134
And then my phone started blowing up.

105
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:09,795
And, you know, that's when everything kind of went down.

106
00:07:10,836 --> 00:07:14,759
So I really didn't have time to think it was just kind of like, we're doing it like it's happening.

107
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,002
And that was also the time period where we had thought there was like, a

108
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:21,459
few million dollars missing from the budget.

109
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,300
And it turns out that wasn't actually what's happening.

110
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,420
It was a spreadsheet error.

111
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:32,162
And we had the awful budget passing that happened that year where a lot of our folks were laid off.

112
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:40,184
And so it was really kind of this what's happening and kind of somber time to be on the committee and especially as someone who

113
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,253
you know, kind of actually just came to peace with the fact that that might have been it.

114
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:48,534
And then to get thrown into it.

115
00:07:48,614 --> 00:07:54,938
And that whole process, you know, I'm happy to see that the Charter Review Committee has a whole section on what happens because it wasn't in our charter.

116
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,321
And we went off of past precedent from another, from a different version of the charter.

117
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:02,863
And so, you know, there was a lot.

118
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:05,725
I think the thing that I love the most right off the bat

119
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:08,637
were the community events, and I knew that's what I was going to love.

120
00:08:09,898 --> 00:08:17,785
You know, one of the things that reasons why I ran and always I knew I wanted to be as present as I could be.

121
00:08:18,305 --> 00:08:31,556
And I'm very thankful to MassArt for helping me be able to do that, because, you know, as a kid, I knew who was on the school committee because they were at events and I knew who Kathy Kratz was and me and Miss Stone and and a bunch of others.

122
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:40,728
but there was this thing, and maybe it was just me, but you know, there was this thing of like, this feels like I'm doing something important because these people are here.

123
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:52,152
This feels like, no matter what it is, a recital, you know, a sporting event, like this feels like a big deal because there are folks here who I view as a big deal that are here to celebrate with us.

124
00:08:52,812 --> 00:09:00,475
And that feeling was something that I always wanted to give back, especially, you know, to the arts and my folks, you know,

125
00:09:01,696 --> 00:09:06,799
who, you know, while the arts are being attacked nationwide, maybe really want that, really want that support.

126
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:16,965
And so, you know, above all, no matter what legislation I wanted to pass, no matter my opinions, like that was something that I always wanted to do was be the present person to show up.

127
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:19,267
And I think that I've been pretty successful with that.

128
00:09:19,307 --> 00:09:19,927
I'd hope so.

129
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:28,532
You know, trying as many invites as I get to work with, to work with my place of employment, to figure out a way to do that and to support those folks.

130
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:35,951
And so that's been something that has been my favorite thing is the community building and seeing, you know, the city rally around community.

131
00:09:36,752 --> 00:09:38,532
You know, it's what I do for work too.

132
00:09:40,353 --> 00:09:45,795
And so seeing the laughs and smiles and also attending events that I attended.

133
00:09:46,721 --> 00:10:02,571
Part of as a student is also surreal, like going to the fifth grade junior Olympics, like that was wild to to, you know, walk with the flag bearers and walk with them down the track with member Brantley and to be that person that I saw as a kid, you know, that's been the most surreal thing.

134
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:15,528
Now like in terms of legislation, I think that I didn't realize how much fun I would have writing legislation and writing policy It's been this kind of like I'm playing lawyer.

135
00:10:15,568 --> 00:10:18,870
I feel like you know counselor saying I'm sort of playing lawyer with things.

136
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:26,653
I'm sure it's counselor saying as he finishes his begins and is in the middle of his you know a law degree but

137
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:35,884
You know, doing that, so writing the water wellness policy, which, um, came out of a lot of the schools testing positive for lead.

138
00:10:36,644 --> 00:10:42,590
Um, and you know, it wasn't just, you know, for those who may have missed that, it wasn't just the high school, which was built in the seventies.

139
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:53,039
It was the Andrews and the McGlynn all very buildings that were built when I was like three, you know, past the point of lead pipes being banned and manufacturing.

140
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:54,000
And so, you know,

141
00:10:55,107 --> 00:10:57,529
hungering down and trying to figure out how do we prevent this going forward.

142
00:10:57,689 --> 00:11:07,718
Also finding out that we're now only one of three cities that have an actual policy on how water is tested.

143
00:11:08,138 --> 00:11:13,683
And we're the only one I believe that actually has numbers and says this is what happens if this number comes up.

144
00:11:13,743 --> 00:11:14,764
This is when you have to do it.

145
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:16,906
This is what happens if it if it tests positive.

146
00:11:17,286 --> 00:11:18,467
How do you reconcile that?

147
00:11:18,952 --> 00:11:24,037
clear guidance so that way no one can kind of go, I don't know what to do, because you don't want to put anyone in that situation.

148
00:11:24,077 --> 00:11:27,600
You don't want to write policy and then be like, well, figure it out.

149
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:28,461
Do your job.

150
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:28,941
Figure it out.

151
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:30,383
That's the last thing you want to do.

152
00:11:30,443 --> 00:11:38,210
So having these sort of backup and safeguards built into it, it makes it lengthier, but you thank yourself in the long run for that.

153
00:11:39,111 --> 00:11:40,833
So I found this love for

154
00:11:41,513 --> 00:12:00,004
authoring policy and figuring out and dissecting policy, finding things like adding things to policy statements or looking over job descriptions and knowing from my time writing job descriptions for students, the legalities of that and going, oh, wait, we actually are not in compliance with mass state law because of this.

155
00:12:00,044 --> 00:12:00,784
We need to fix that.

156
00:12:00,944 --> 00:12:01,585
We need to do that.

157
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:07,068
And so pulling in that knowledge, that's something I've really loved.

158
00:12:09,012 --> 00:12:10,993
And I knew I was going to love it because that's why I would have ran.

159
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:16,356
I didn't want to run just because I wanted the power and whatever.

160
00:12:16,456 --> 00:12:30,482
And I wanted to be an advocate and to learn this position that I had admired so much as a kid and figure out what that was like and keep moving forward.

161
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:37,206
And that's why I'm running, seeking renomination and seeking it again is because I've really loved doing it.

162
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:46,229
I love the invites, I love showing up to everything that I can and just seeing the city grow in that way, especially the children of this city.

163
00:12:47,671 --> 00:12:55,277
Just seeing all the achievements they have and being able to parade around that and celebrate that has been my favorite thing, for sure.

164
00:12:55,297 --> 00:12:56,258
Thank you.

165
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:57,159
Yeah, it sounds really...

166
00:12:58,673 --> 00:13:03,337
rewarding and overwhelming and like you've learned a lot in the last two years.

167
00:13:03,457 --> 00:13:05,118
I had to learn a lot really quick.

168
00:13:05,158 --> 00:13:11,784
And I'm very thankful that my background as a trustee at MassArt got rid of all the Roberts rules worry.

169
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:14,486
Like there's still some very niche things that I still have to ask about.

170
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:16,347
And you'll see me ask about it, honestly, on the floor.

171
00:13:16,388 --> 00:13:17,769
Like, how do we approach this?

172
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:18,229
What do we do?

173
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:28,628
But that sort of open meeting law of Roberts rules thing being knowing that I was, I was really able to just learn or what are the rules of this specific committee.

174
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:31,924
and how do we do this so that way I don't get anyone else in trouble?

175
00:13:32,424 --> 00:13:36,445
Because I would hate to get my colleagues in trouble for my rookie mistake.

176
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:38,185
That's that.

177
00:13:38,205 --> 00:13:39,645
Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.

178
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:40,746
No, you didn't.

179
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:50,888
No, I was wondering, you kind of referenced this, you are kind of, I think, leading into this, but two years is, it probably went by really quickly, right?

180
00:13:50,908 --> 00:13:53,089
Because you're very busy and there's a lot to get done.

181
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:58,510
And one of the things we did talk about in the reviewing the charter was extending terms.

182
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:04,971
I think that it's also a big ask because, you know, even though they did increase your salaries, it does feel like mostly you're volunteering here.

183
00:14:06,251 --> 00:14:14,633
But I guess with two more years or, you know, kind of if you're if you approach this is like you're kind of learning, getting comfortable, starting to make some changes.

184
00:14:15,193 --> 00:14:16,733
What do you hope to continue?

185
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:19,153
Should you be reelected for another two years?

186
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:20,294
For sure.

187
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:22,614
I think one of the things is.

188
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:28,235
You know, looking through our so there was actually an instance where this came up.

189
00:14:29,283 --> 00:14:36,309
I think it was the last meeting we had, not like the last, like the last meeting of the school committee for this.

190
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:42,314
Now we're in recess, but it was around the MCAS policy.

191
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:50,141
And I was looking for another policy in our policy bank, and I noticed we had a whole policy around MCAS being its own graduation requirement.

192
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:52,623
And so even though we struck it from,

193
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:57,981
another policy, like our graduation policy, there was a whole policy around MCAS.

194
00:14:58,101 --> 00:15:06,649
And so, you know, I don't know enough about law to know if that would cause a conflict, but being able to look through and understand like, oh, this may conflict, let's bring it to the floor.

195
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:09,992
Let's sort of clean up that policy bank has been something sort of fun.

196
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:18,199
But on a serious note, you know, looking at, I think the number one thing or one of the number one things on my platform for reelection is voter engagement.

197
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,240
and voter education.

198
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:30,443
And that is something that I think we don't have really an in-house system on how to train our students on how to be responsible, educated voters.

199
00:15:30,743 --> 00:15:37,685
And my time at MassArt, I was chair of the MassArt Votes effort, which basically

200
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:43,259
picks up the pace where, you know, K through 12 didn't with voter engagement.

201
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:46,022
So we take the students and we get them registered to vote.

202
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:51,007
We tell them what to do in terms of, you know, can you technically register to vote here?

203
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:51,748
Can you not?

204
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:53,069
What does Mass State Law says?

205
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:54,751
What does Mass State Law say?

206
00:15:56,473 --> 00:15:59,736
And so that's really one of the efforts that I think we need student input on.

207
00:15:59,776 --> 00:16:00,537
I said that a lot.

208
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:04,478
two years ago was I'm running on we need student input.

209
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:08,380
And what do they need, you know, I ran into issues.

210
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:19,224
And I don't want to air them, you know, over the radio waves but of some but they were startling, you know, of what students didn't understand it ranged from students knowing who their

211
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:26,074
you know, city clerk was, a register of voters was, but they couldn't get the registration to them because they didn't know how to mail a letter.

212
00:16:26,934 --> 00:16:33,798
Or, you know, they thought, oh, I can early vote in Boston because I live in Boston, I'm dorming in Boston, but I'm registered to vote in Quincy.

213
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,600
But that says I can early vote here, so why can't I?

214
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:44,345
And so sort of clearing that up and sort of trying to educate our students, because the way we're doing it, you know, we have a civics program in our middle schools.

215
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:56,457
But what we're doing at the high school level is really some just really cool and responsible faculty members that are grabbing nomination, that are grabbing registration papers from City Hall and bringing them to class.

216
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,381
And I don't think it's fair to rely on our faculty to do that.

217
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:05,507
I think that we owe it to our students to have, you know, if we complain about low voter turnout,

218
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:08,969
And we want to go down that road.

219
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:13,331
We really need to make sure that we have systems in place to educate them.

220
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:17,513
Because once they go to college, if they go to an out-of-state college, what do they do?

221
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:18,594
Do they register to vote there?

222
00:17:19,134 --> 00:17:20,795
Do they do late voting here?

223
00:17:21,535 --> 00:17:23,076
You know, these are things really hard.

224
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:26,978
I was on my I was on the phone on election day with parents, like trying to come up with solutions.

225
00:17:27,618 --> 00:17:30,979
It wants to vote, but like this is this and this is that and just trying to figure that out.

226
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:39,583
And I don't want anyone that lives in any student that lives in Medford that goes to college having to have those worries and concerns, you know, on election day.

227
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:41,644
I want them to be able to know what to do and how to vote.

228
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:46,691
And so that's sort of one of the efforts that I really want to work.

229
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:53,217
Cause yeah, two years flies by and you know, once you have community meetings and all that, Oh, it's time for reelection.

230
00:17:53,878 --> 00:17:54,278
Yeah.

231
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:59,803
What I really want to see, which would be, well, this is something I actually thought about doing when I was in high school was.

232
00:18:00,423 --> 00:18:08,626
changing the voter age for the city to 16 so that students that were currently in high school could vote in municipal elections, which I think would be really cool.

233
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:14,889
And did you, I think this maybe I made this up, but was there, is there like a student liaison to the school committee?

234
00:18:15,481 --> 00:18:16,421
Yeah, so there's two.

235
00:18:16,582 --> 00:18:17,382
There's usually two.

236
00:18:18,022 --> 00:18:23,065
So the way, there's a student liaison who usually sits in on the meetings and gives input.

237
00:18:23,405 --> 00:18:30,048
There's also a student advisory council that is made up of students of all grade levels, and they meet internally at the high school.

238
00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:33,950
We really haven't, to be honest, we really didn't meet with them that much this academic year.

239
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:38,752
Last academic year, we were meeting with them on some specific things that are escaping me at the moment.

240
00:18:38,793 --> 00:18:42,754
But I remember going, because I was in the dorm, so it was definitely last academic year.

241
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:47,473
in calls with students about engagement.

242
00:18:47,653 --> 00:18:51,896
We're talking about extending the school day by 15 minutes.

243
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:59,641
And we've been getting emails from students concerned about mental health concerns or other things about what will be offered for that.

244
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:06,125
And so we are receiving input, but we're not meeting with them as much as I remember us doing.

245
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,887
And I'm not sure why that is.

246
00:19:07,907 --> 00:19:10,108
I don't mean, I'm not trying to air out a grievance here,

247
00:19:12,212 --> 00:19:15,114
you know, that component was missing this past academic year.

248
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:22,840
But I definitely loved meeting with them and, you know, seeing them in that spot, because I was in that spot as a student president in high school.

249
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:34,329
But yeah, trying to figure out, you know, working with our civics department, working with our director of marketing, working with students to figure out how can we best, you know, talk specifically about voting.

250
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:35,270
How do we push that?

251
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,291
And how do we get them ready for that?

252
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:38,092
So that way,

253
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:45,572
I think we owe it to our students to get them as ready as we can for college or trades or the military, wherever they may go.

254
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:50,819
So that way, once they leave us, they feel prepared and set up.

255
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:52,041
And I don't know if we're there yet.

256
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:53,563
I know I hear from.

257
00:19:54,273 --> 00:20:01,238
What I remember, I mean, I didn't learn how to write a check until I opened the business account to run for this office.

258
00:20:01,258 --> 00:20:05,982
I didn't know how to open a bank account because we did it a few years ago.

259
00:20:06,002 --> 00:20:07,042
But I didn't learn that in school.

260
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:09,544
And I didn't learn how to write a check and do this and do that.

261
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:16,855
And so, you know, looking at programs like the career fair, revamping that, looking at how we can, I mean, that was great.

262
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,237
That was a huge reality check for renting.

263
00:20:19,257 --> 00:20:19,878
Are you kidding me?

264
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:25,623
You go around, you have a set, you get like a random job and you go around to tables and they go, Oh, you want a car or a bus pass?

265
00:20:25,663 --> 00:20:28,265
Because now you can't pay rent if you get a car, but you can't do that.

266
00:20:28,285 --> 00:20:29,446
And you're like, wow, this is intense.

267
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:30,126
This is scary.

268
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:35,851
And now, you know, you get to be my age 24 and you're like, Oh no, that was, that was actually, it was better than now.

269
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:39,754
The game of life, yeah.

270
00:20:39,974 --> 00:20:40,734
It is the game of life.

271
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:42,375
It was a big game of life in the gym.

272
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:43,255
And that's what it was.

273
00:20:43,315 --> 00:20:45,016
And local businesses came and volunteered.

274
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:45,876
It was awesome.

275
00:20:46,456 --> 00:20:47,677
I remember it very vividly.

276
00:20:47,697 --> 00:21:03,743
And coming up with more opportunities for our students to do that, I hate to say it like this, but at MassArt, working with student government funds for the MassArt Activities Council, which are the eight students that I directly oversee, we do a lot with nothing.

277
00:21:03,843 --> 00:21:06,984
Because the funds get spread around, and we try to fund as many

278
00:21:07,424 --> 00:21:29,187
organizations they can and so that's what I find myself feeling like every time I have to problem-solve in Medford is we have to do a lot with like not a lot because we have to figure out how can we make the best out of what we have and so for that it's like voter engagement like what are we doing are we are we doing pamphlets are we doing online QR codes what do we have to do to make sure it's budget-friendly but also having the impact of

279
00:21:29,507 --> 00:21:37,038
That will change students, you know, the career fair, how can we work with local businesses to make it happen to maybe donate part of their time or donate efforts.

280
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:42,386
You know, looking for loopholes like that, because I mean for those.

281
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:52,250
For those folks who, I didn't realize this until school committee training, 80% of the budget in most school districts is personnel, and rightfully so.

282
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,551
But that's when people go, well, where's all this money?

283
00:21:55,011 --> 00:21:57,912
It's paying the people who are educating our students.

284
00:21:57,932 --> 00:21:59,792
80% of that goes to personnel.

285
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:02,913
And so you're dealt with 20% to do everything else.

286
00:22:04,013 --> 00:22:11,455
And so figuring out how we can do things amazing, but also set our faculty up for success, our students up for success, our administrators up for success,

287
00:22:12,955 --> 00:22:22,660
can be tricky and can be hard and you know that that's sort of what I've been trying to do is sit back and kind of look at all right where where can we do these small fixes that maybe have big impact.

288
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,983
Yeah, it's it seemed to me like the for the past couple decades at Medford it was like.

289
00:22:28,704 --> 00:22:42,308
you're working with like a pie and instead of like, and you're figuring out like who gets less every time and who gets more instead of like making another pie, but you know, hopefully the override helps with a little bit of that, but yeah, but so yeah, yeah.

290
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:47,470
I'm sorry, I think I interrupted you, but are any other sort of hopes for you for the next term?

291
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:50,043
I think, you know, just keep on moving.

292
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:59,366
We're in a really cool direction with, you know, looking at hopefully getting a new high school building, um, looking at new programs to bring into, you know, um, the schools themselves.

293
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:02,047
But I think, you know, those are my main big things.

294
00:23:02,087 --> 00:23:13,711
I'd also love, you know, um, to see a larger emphasis and we're getting there with, I mean, we just had, we as a district just had our AP art exhibition at arts collaborative Medford.

295
00:23:14,104 --> 00:23:17,026
I'm loving the emphasis on local artists and the local arts.

296
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:30,693
As a former, you know, board member of the West Memphis Open Studios, as a practicing artist for both performing and in sculptural work, you know, empowering artists to make change is huge.

297
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:39,778
It's a completely different, you know, mindset in terms of how they approach things and really pushing our students to, you know,

298
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:45,301
show those off and to work when we've been making a lot of efforts to, you know, local murals.

299
00:23:45,401 --> 00:24:00,350
And, you know, I think the like the pop up the pop up space over by the senior center in Medford and Medford Square, you know, that was that was helped in part design murals were designed by the National Art Society at Medford High.

300
00:24:01,069 --> 00:24:17,397
And so, you know, really empowering artists, I think, is also a huge priority, I'd say that a lot of my priorities from two years ago are still going because I think that I know that this past year has been, you know, all right, learning all the realities and learning all the technical things and you know,

301
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:22,319
when I was forming this slate, I'm like, all right, I'd love to be like, I want to create this and I want to do that.

302
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,560
But the reality is we can't afford that.

303
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,981
We can't do that right now, at least not in a two year span.

304
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:34,283
And so trying to think of very specific, tangible things that we can work on has been my priority.

305
00:24:34,343 --> 00:24:42,006
And so bringing the arts into a lot of different areas and bringing them into different spaces, you know, maybe we do pop up galleries across which we have been doing with.

306
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:46,248
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry that the

307
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,302
organization is escaping me at the moment, with Arts Medford.

308
00:24:50,982 --> 00:24:57,645
And I believe it's Arts Medford, and I'm sorry if I'm misquoting, but we had like a pop-up art walk all across the city.

309
00:24:58,806 --> 00:25:06,250
And doing that, you know, there were some, I believe some student artists, or maybe I'm thinking of last year, but that's a huge priority of mine.

310
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,652
Advocating for our nurses has been a huge also priority of mine.

311
00:25:10,692 --> 00:25:11,172
There's some,

312
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:26,592
They have had some pushback in terms of some of the policy or hiring, not hiring personnel numbers we've been giving them because of outdated practices and, you know, so continue to advocate for them to make sure that that doesn't happen again.

313
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:29,015
And that doesn't continue to happen in, you know.

314
00:25:30,046 --> 00:25:32,788
as many budget cycles as I can say that I can be a part of.

315
00:25:32,808 --> 00:25:38,090
Does that mean like hiring more nurses, like a better ratio of nurses?

316
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:47,255
So there's there's a there when we were looking at the numbers, you know, there were certain, you know, full time positions that were designated for each school and designated there.

317
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:52,038
And there was talk about how that wasn't enough, because if one one nurse is

318
00:25:52,720 --> 00:26:00,232
getting an epi pen for a student or getting an inhaler for a student then they're out there you know they're off the floor there's nothing i can happen so you know god forbid something

319
00:26:01,105 --> 00:26:02,546
two people get hurt, three people get hurt.

320
00:26:02,586 --> 00:26:03,607
There's not enough nurses there.

321
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:07,249
So we have a floater that goes between buildings and stuff like that.

322
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:13,434
But during public sessions, there were complaints that those were based off of outdated numbers.

323
00:26:13,474 --> 00:26:16,576
So we, as a district, thought, oh, we're doing what the standard is.

324
00:26:16,636 --> 00:26:21,319
But the position of the union and the staff was, that's not what those are the numbers.

325
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:21,959
That's outdated.

326
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,080
We need more.

327
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,701
We need better.

328
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,781
We need better staffing.

329
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:34,764
And so, I mean, as a student who got attention deficit meds from them, you know, I saw that like, oh, I'll help you in a second.

330
00:26:34,784 --> 00:26:37,966
There's five kids in the waiting room, but they got to go help me in the back because even though I'm 18.

331
00:26:39,203 --> 00:26:42,406
I can't give myself my own meds, and I don't think people realize that.

332
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:45,609
Or they have to get the EpiPen, or they have to go get Tylenol.

333
00:26:47,511 --> 00:26:50,393
So things like that, I think, is also a huge priority of mine.

334
00:26:50,533 --> 00:27:04,166
But still continuing to hopefully be, no, not hopefully, still continuing to be the present school community member who can show up to as many shows, or as many sport outings, or as many volunteer opportunities and give back, whether it's

335
00:27:05,962 --> 00:27:18,635
missing the opportunity to help donate for a 50-50 raffle, but giving an art basket for a student, or helping sponsor a t-shirt, things like that, where it's like, all right, I can't make the event, but how can I give you money to help make sure it happens well?

336
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:28,285
That has been something that I've also loved to do and will continue to do in my hopeful next two years on the committee.

337
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:29,690
Great.

338
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,291
Well, thank you.

339
00:27:30,311 --> 00:27:41,638
I'm curious just to, if you kind of can reflect on the, your time so far, if there are any like major takeaways or like a major thing that you've learned in your time so far on the school committee.

340
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:47,402
I think, you know, I have had an amazing time being on it.

341
00:27:49,304 --> 00:27:58,070
It's also been a time where, you know, we talk about, you know, darker times with budget cycles and learning the reality of that.

342
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:03,238
You know, you want to give – I'm trying to think of a way to say this.

343
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:15,442
You know, making those tough decisions and having to be the one to say that and with a simple yes, saying yes, the impact that that truly has on families.

344
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:23,941
a year ago when our budget that we passed because we were underfunded had to, you know, laid people off.

345
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:34,144
And I was like, I need people to realize that we are saying numbers, but these are people, these are bills, these are homes that could be impacted by one of us simply saying yes or no.

346
00:28:34,824 --> 00:28:43,927
And, you know, you've realized that, but when you're sitting in that chair and going to push the button, it really, really hurts.

347
00:28:44,107 --> 00:28:45,548
And it really is something that, you know,

348
00:28:48,381 --> 00:28:53,443
I didn't, voting, there's a lot of hesitation because you've realized the gravity of what you're about to say.

349
00:28:55,043 --> 00:28:58,144
And I've also learned like really how much showing up matters.

350
00:28:58,164 --> 00:29:15,330
I mean, I've always known showing up matters and, you know, as from the perspective of witnessing it and feeling that, you know, love from folks, whether it's my parents or my siblings or members of the school committee, but really how much people appreciate

351
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:23,929
their elected officials being there for them and showing that by taking time out of their day to do things that aren't, you know, their biweekly meetings.

352
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:34,551
I never realized how much that would impact me seeing it on the other side and how much that also did a lot for me as a person.

353
00:29:35,751 --> 00:29:43,993
But I think the last two years, you know, I've always tried to lead with love and courage and just wanting to make sure that everyone has a seat at the table.

354
00:29:46,154 --> 00:29:52,196
and try to approach it from a problem-solving mindset that I, as an artist, have that unique perspective of.

355
00:29:52,336 --> 00:29:58,259
And it's one thing to employ artists because of what they do, but also the way they think.

356
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:11,044
And when you put artists in charge, it's like, oh, that's cool representation, but it's also a different viewpoint and a different way of thinking at the table that is really special to those folks.

357
00:30:11,872 --> 00:30:24,569
I think I'm talking in circles, I feel like I'm blabbing, but there's just so much, you know, it's been such a privilege and an honor to be on the committee and to see that childhood dream come to life of

358
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,682
doing the work that I've wanted to do since I was in the second grade.

359
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,683
And I wanted to abolish the MCAS, which we did.

360
00:30:30,883 --> 00:30:34,645
We got rid of it as a graduation requirement because the Massachusetts voters said we could.

361
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:43,910
There's a literal Facebook quote, I think, from my mom back when I was in the second grade of like, John wants to get on the school committee because he wants to get rid of the MCAS.

362
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,311
Or it was either that or summer reading.

363
00:30:45,351 --> 00:30:46,352
It might have been both.

364
00:30:46,532 --> 00:30:47,652
I really didn't like both.

365
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:50,514
I learned to love summer reading but still continued to hate the MCAS.

366
00:30:52,555 --> 00:30:56,416
And so, you know, being able to live out this childhood dream has been such a pleasure.

367
00:30:56,436 --> 00:30:59,757
And I mean, I can't do it without the voters of Medford.

368
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:12,740
And I thank them greatly for putting that trust into me and allowing me to do that and realize just how much I love this work and just how much I love being there for our students and our faculty and staff.

369
00:31:13,885 --> 00:31:15,888
Well, then thank you, John, for your work.

370
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:16,869
Thank you.

371
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:22,596
Is there anything that you want to like plug, like any events you have coming up or anywhere we can read more about your campaign?

372
00:31:23,077 --> 00:31:23,317
Yeah.

373
00:31:23,357 --> 00:31:25,760
So we the kickoff is currently being planned.

374
00:31:26,648 --> 00:31:27,409
It's in the works.

375
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:33,491
I'm hoping to aim for the first or second, you know, middle of September, so keep your eye out for that.

376
00:31:34,612 --> 00:31:38,534
You can find me on pretty much every social platform besides Axe.

377
00:31:39,074 --> 00:31:41,896
I'm on Instagram and Facebook as Antapa4Medford.

378
00:31:41,996 --> 00:31:45,317
I think it's either Instagram or Facebook.

379
00:31:45,397 --> 00:31:49,879
I'm Antapa4Medford because they said I was trying to impersonate myself.

380
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:58,578
So yeah, Instagram, Intapa4Medford, F-O-R, and then Facebook should be Intapa4, the number four, Medford.

381
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:10,988
And then if you go to Intapa4Medford, which is Intapa, the number four, Medford.com, you can find my website and platform and all the stuff that I'm doing.

382
00:32:11,449 --> 00:32:12,489
And that's still under construction.

383
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:14,031
So please have some patience.

384
00:32:14,051 --> 00:32:16,212
Hopefully it'll be done by the time this airs.

385
00:32:18,027 --> 00:32:19,708
that's where you can find everything that I'm up to.

386
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:27,853
If you have campaign asks, you can email me at intapa4medford at gmail.com.

387
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:37,079
If you have school committee asks and want to talk to me as an elected official, you can reach me at jintapa at medford.k12.ma.us.

388
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:38,740
Thank you.

389
00:32:39,601 --> 00:32:41,722
Anything else that you want to mention before we wrap up?

390
00:32:42,215 --> 00:32:49,223
No, just thank you so much, honestly, for the work that y'all do for the community by doing these podcasts and by interviewing all of us.

391
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:57,854
It's really well appreciated, especially as we lack a local newspaper, which we have some new ones starting up, which is really awesome.

392
00:32:59,373 --> 00:33:06,418
But this is really helpful, not only to us, I can say that, but also helpful to the voters to hear that.

393
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:12,682
And it's nice to have a casual conversation and just talk about what we love about the city and what we want to do for it and stuff like that.

394
00:33:13,262 --> 00:33:15,264
And also plugging local food businesses.

395
00:33:15,344 --> 00:33:16,805
So I'm sure they appreciate it.

396
00:33:17,165 --> 00:33:19,867
I'm sure the restaurants really love you all for doing that.

397
00:33:20,027 --> 00:33:20,887
Or whoever listens.

398
00:33:21,007 --> 00:33:21,468
I don't know.

399
00:33:21,488 --> 00:33:21,848
Exactly.

400
00:33:22,008 --> 00:33:22,528
Exactly.

401
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:23,489
Of course.

402
00:33:23,529 --> 00:33:23,729
Yeah.

403
00:33:23,949 --> 00:33:24,730
I'm happy to do it.

404
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,731
And yeah, thank you so much for being here.

405
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:27,552
Awesome.

406
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:27,872
Thank you.
