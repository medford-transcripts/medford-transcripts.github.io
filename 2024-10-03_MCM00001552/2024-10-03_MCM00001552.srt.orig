1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:01,872
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to call the meeting to order.

2
00:00:01,892 --> 00:00:10,238
[SPEAKER_07]: The next item on the agenda is the approval of the minutes of the meeting.

3
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:32,328
[SPEAKER_07]: to provide updates on the minute meetings, if there's been any changes to the minute meetings.

4
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:34,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Have there been any changes?

5
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:37,911
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there haven't been any changes to the meeting minutes.

6
00:00:39,812 --> 00:00:48,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so if there's no edits to the minutes, I would like to request a motion to approve the meeting minutes from September 4th, 2024.

7
00:00:48,638 --> 00:00:48,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

8
00:00:58,383 --> 00:01:01,545
[SPEAKER_07]: One for me.

9
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:03,846
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll approve.

10
00:01:03,986 --> 00:01:04,446
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll accept.

11
00:01:04,846 --> 00:01:06,847
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to do a roll call if we have anyone.

12
00:01:06,987 --> 00:01:09,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anyone of our members who is online?

13
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:09,729
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

14
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:10,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, OK.

15
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:10,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we're good.

16
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:11,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

17
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:17,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I need to do a roll call?

18
00:01:17,713 --> 00:01:18,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I just say?

19
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:19,294
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to.

20
00:01:19,314 --> 00:01:19,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

21
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:23,756
[SPEAKER_06]: If we're all here in the room, then we can just raise our hand.

22
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:27,478
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll all accept.

23
00:01:28,273 --> 00:01:28,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

24
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:31,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

25
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get better at this as we go along.

26
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:37,270
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good.

27
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,050
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my fault.

28
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,011
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get better.

29
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:40,733
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all friends here, right?

30
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:50,500
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so next on the agenda is the Working Groups and Updates Declaration of Trust.

31
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:55,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Kayla will provide us with a draft and comments.

32
00:01:56,145 --> 00:01:57,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for doing this, Kayla.

33
00:02:01,326 --> 00:02:16,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I finished the draft, and I had a couple questions as we went through, but if you want to just go through each, or, you know, just scroll through and then, and just questions on them, feel free to go as we go along.

34
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:22,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, you know, I am not an expert in this, but I'll try to answer any questions that we had going through.

35
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:30,476
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great reading the other trusts, kind of try to like know some, and then really just use the ordinance as a

36
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I just try to kind of limit it to that.

37
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:40,722
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is why some of the questions is going to be about whether we feel comfortable expanding anything from the ordinance.

38
00:02:40,822 --> 00:02:46,603
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to just keep it exactly what the ordinance says.

39
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:53,804
[SPEAKER_05]: So just the explanation, title, and address, purpose of the trust, again, just lifted it directly from the ordinance.

40
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:57,845
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to expand it into a more substantive paragraph, we can.

41
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:01,114
[SPEAKER_05]: place to start.

42
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:13,825
[SPEAKER_05]: The composition and identity of the board of trustees just talked about how many terms of office, how to deal with resignations or vacancies.

43
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:22,533
[SPEAKER_05]: So I said that anyone can resign by written notice signed by the trustee who's resigning and sent to the chair.

44
00:03:22,553 --> 00:03:26,537
[SPEAKER_05]: If a vacancy shall occur, it should be filled in the same manner as the

45
00:03:27,178 --> 00:03:31,120
[SPEAKER_05]: making a trustee for the unexpired terms, basically like substitute a trustee in.

46
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:50,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Removal, there was a removal section in the ordinance and it just said this, which was any member can be removed by the mayor for cause after the opportunity of a hearing, which I wasn't sure if that was specific enough, a hearing in front of who, a hearing in front of what body, that was my own question there.

47
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:53,210
[SPEAKER_05]: So that might be something for the solicitor to,

48
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,663
[SPEAKER_05]: If anyone else had any ideas about what would happen in removal?

49
00:03:59,683 --> 00:04:03,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if the CPA have any removal causes in there.

50
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:16,557
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually a really good question because we actually had a situation where we wanted to remove a member and we didn't know how to go about it.

51
00:04:16,577 --> 00:04:18,078
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of clumsy.

52
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:20,641
[SPEAKER_06]: They finally just left of their own accord.

53
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:32,192
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we tried to write some procedures that would help us to handle that situation if it ever arose again.

54
00:04:32,212 --> 00:04:42,462
[SPEAKER_06]: And we never had the legal assistance to review that to make sure that what we drafted was legal.

55
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:55,475
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah, I feel like that's something that we'll have to handle if it ever comes to that.

56
00:04:55,495 --> 00:05:01,218
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not sure if there's a best practice that we can draw from.

57
00:05:01,238 --> 00:05:01,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

58
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,421
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I have no idea.

59
00:05:07,022 --> 00:05:13,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'd have to look, try to think about the City of Somerville's Affordable Housing Trust for the full declaration.

60
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:14,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll look to see if there is one.

61
00:05:15,563 --> 00:05:18,824
[SPEAKER_07]: but maybe putting examples of reasons.

62
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:24,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was thinking less about so much reasons and more about the process.

63
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:28,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the kind of the due process is kind of what I'm thinking about here.

64
00:05:28,926 --> 00:05:34,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Like for city employees, there's a process that's very clear about what happens and who hears it.

65
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:37,608
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's what I was wondering here is who would hear it.

66
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:43,690
[SPEAKER_05]: It just says the mayor kind of initiates it, and then there's a hearing by a party to be

67
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:46,834
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's the weird part about it.

68
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:47,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

69
00:05:47,234 --> 00:05:50,375
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't want to just follow the city employee process then.

70
00:05:50,395 --> 00:05:52,836
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, what would you?

71
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:56,758
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I was thinking sort of along the same lines.

72
00:05:56,838 --> 00:06:05,381
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like if somebody is being terminated for cause, they get notification of some sort of reasons.

73
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:12,664
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I'm saying is there maybe like examples of violation of the social,

74
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,241
[SPEAKER_07]: We just signed it.

75
00:06:17,521 --> 00:06:18,542
[SPEAKER_07]: The social media.

76
00:06:18,622 --> 00:06:19,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

77
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:26,548
[SPEAKER_07]: The violation of the social media policy, a violation of the ethics or something like that, like those various reasons.

78
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:28,590
[SPEAKER_07]: And then figure out.

79
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:37,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just trying to think, and then, yes, I agree that there needs to be something like some sort of like, who are we?

80
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:41,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it the city council that we that has the.

81
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:45,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'm not too sure as well, but I could check with our

82
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:46,928
[SPEAKER_08]: the council.

83
00:06:47,508 --> 00:07:00,117
[SPEAKER_06]: And this might be a question to bring up again when the mayor is in the room because ultimately she might be the arbiter for how to deal with this situation.

84
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:01,318
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really complicated.

85
00:07:01,938 --> 00:07:12,326
[SPEAKER_06]: When we dealt with it before, it was because that person's behavior was problematic and committee members felt threatened.

86
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,027
[SPEAKER_06]: by being in the room with him.

87
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:28,850
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had like, we probably went about it all wrong at the time, but it was clear that something had to happen and the mayor was working with us to try to figure out what that was.

88
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:38,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Another trust had, if you miss like three or four meetings in a row, then there's kind of like an automatic bounce just for non-attendance.

89
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:45,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Somerville had a conflict of interest clause, which I think was interesting, but then they didn't have what happens if you need to remove someone's clause.

90
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:53,261
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of assumed that no one would need to be removed if, if only, but for the conflict of interest clause.

91
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:55,782
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I think that's a good idea.

92
00:07:55,822 --> 00:07:58,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to bring it up when the mayor joins us.

93
00:08:00,584 --> 00:08:02,005
[SPEAKER_05]: The next article,

94
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:10,808
[SPEAKER_05]: is very long, but kind of just lays out all the possible powers that the trustees will have as a collective whole.

95
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:14,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, a lot of this came from the ordinance.

96
00:08:15,172 --> 00:08:18,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I really added that much to it.

97
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:20,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I did add one section.

98
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:25,161
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one provider that I think was probably added by the city council.

99
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:25,582
[SPEAKER_05]: It was

100
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:35,965
[SPEAKER_05]: that the trust may not convey any real property having an area more than 7,500 square feet without the approval of the city council is how they wrote it.

101
00:08:36,486 --> 00:08:42,609
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I wondered if we wanted to say if it's a unanimous city council or if it was a majority city council.

102
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:51,035
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now I've drafted as majority of the city council, but that is probably a question that we should refer back to council or city council itself.

103
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:58,435
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be, I don't know about unanimous, but another option, it might be a super majority.

104
00:08:58,795 --> 00:09:03,379
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be like a financial decision.

105
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,423
[SPEAKER_06]: But that would be helpful to know how many city councilors have to approve something.

106
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:13,907
[SPEAKER_05]: In number five, I just added consultants.

107
00:09:14,127 --> 00:09:20,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Previously, it was just accountants, appraisers, lawyers, and I thought being a little broader there might be useful.

108
00:09:22,305 --> 00:09:41,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Another question, 13, the language used this word attribute, which I just couldn't figure out.

109
00:09:42,137 --> 00:09:49,281
[SPEAKER_05]: So I questioned whether that meant arbitrage or if attribute is a different word for arbitration.

110
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:53,808
[SPEAKER_08]: The master plan said state, no states.

111
00:09:54,148 --> 00:10:03,632
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the attribute.

112
00:10:03,872 --> 00:10:10,874
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at the end, I just added a couple of different ideas that I saw from other municipalities.

113
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:18,857
[SPEAKER_05]: One was to accept or create loans and grants, and that was in the Somerville article.

114
00:10:19,677 --> 00:10:21,618
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Lexington, I thought was interesting.

115
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:30,363
[SPEAKER_05]: They did say like they were going to be the body that made recommendations about how housing policy to their legislative body.

116
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:38,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Also help develop policy goals and then be the lottery agent for political housing in there.

117
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:42,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, copy as well, which does come with some compensation.

118
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:48,894
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is also might be another place where we can get some income for the trust.

119
00:10:50,236 --> 00:11:11,768
[SPEAKER_06]: One caution about using Somerville as a model is that their trust was created before the state legislation, so it's not always consistent with what we're allowed to do today because ours was created under the state legislation and Somerville's was not.

120
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:22,416
[SPEAKER_06]: In most situations, they were grandfathered in, but every once in a while, something comes along where the state says, no, you actually have to do what everybody else is doing.

121
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, some of them ended up adopting the state.

122
00:11:26,117 --> 00:11:26,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, OK.

123
00:11:26,877 --> 00:11:29,818
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a homeroom petition to try to go back to.

124
00:11:32,418 --> 00:11:34,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they had more freedom before.

125
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

126
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:43,081
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, some of these questions, question marks that you've left, maybe

127
00:11:43,892 --> 00:11:49,256
[SPEAKER_06]: are things that we really need to go over with the mayor and perhaps with legal counsel.

128
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:50,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

129
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:51,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

130
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:52,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, probably.

131
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,059
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're talking about item 16.

132
00:11:55,179 --> 00:12:00,423
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't really item 16, it was whether we were going to add any further items.

133
00:12:01,323 --> 00:12:07,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this was really more just a point that things were different in other towns and if people feel comfortable with

134
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,183
[SPEAKER_05]: going just by the plain statute ordinance as it was written.

135
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:15,085
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just disregard this section.

136
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:27,515
[SPEAKER_06]: If we're allowed to add more than what was in the ordinance, I feel like the more flexibility we give ourselves, the happier we'll be down the road.

137
00:12:27,535 --> 00:12:29,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Most likely, yeah.

138
00:12:31,263 --> 00:12:35,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there other places in the section that they can do policy advocacy?

139
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:51,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think I've been taking that question around myself and I think giving us the option to do it while we decide our action planning goals needs flexibility that I'm interested in, but I think it's something to consider as a group.

140
00:12:53,948 --> 00:12:58,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think the list at this time really includes that.

141
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:14,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say that powers of the Board of Trustees, I mean, I think this is kind of supposed to be limited to legal actions, financial actions, things like that.

142
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:22,680
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be relevant if we had to commission a study or get a consultant in order to reduce the advocacy.

143
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:31,344
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, yeah, I would say right now it's probably a no to just plain advocacy.

144
00:13:31,364 --> 00:13:38,328
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of like in Lexington, like they outsourced some of their housing policy to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

145
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:56,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've seen communities where they use the Affordable Housing Trust kind of as a substitute for missing town staff to guide development projects and help them navigate the approval process.

146
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:09,950
[SPEAKER_06]: So, or to recruit developers to build affordable housing projects and then so I don't know if we're precluded from doing things that are not in the powers.

147
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:13,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe another question for the council.

148
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:15,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that include things as issuing?

149
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:21,273
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think so.

150
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:31,242
[SPEAKER_05]: If an RFP has been issued in relation to something like creating a new house or, you know, selling land to do X, Y, and Z, I think that would be fine.

151
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:40,731
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just, it would just be like, we believe in some sort of housing policy would be good overall, and we're going to advocate it to the city council or the public.

152
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:44,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's kind of, that's probably not in here right now.

153
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:58,524
[SPEAKER_05]: As trustees, you know, so majority of trustees may exercise all the powers.

154
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:02,768
[SPEAKER_05]: No trustee is going to be required to give any sort of like bond or guarantee.

155
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:16,138
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we don't need like a special action in order to have another party say like, okay, the Board of Trustees gave us this approval and we don't need any further court action.

156
00:15:16,218 --> 00:15:16,978
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Article 5.

157
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:22,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Article six is always one that everyone here should understand.

158
00:15:23,384 --> 00:15:29,128
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are not liable for negligence or defaults of any trust or any employee.

159
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:35,172
[SPEAKER_05]: So if an appraiser makes a mistake or something like that, we're not liable for that.

160
00:15:36,773 --> 00:15:43,658
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not liable for acts made in good faith and we're not liable on acts that were on vice counsel.

161
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:48,994
[SPEAKER_05]: The other way you can do it is to basically say what you are liable for.

162
00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:50,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, this is all in the negative.

163
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:59,760
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not liable for x, y, z. You can also say that you are going to only be liable for things, and it's usually gross negligence or willful misconduct.

164
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,662
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've written it in the negative right now.

165
00:16:03,102 --> 00:16:06,003
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be in the positive if people feel either way.

166
00:16:06,023 --> 00:16:08,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it both ways, this kind of clause.

167
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:19,719
[SPEAKER_07]: hate to be the ones that sound negative, but I like it being there.

168
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:23,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a negative person, but it really spells out what we are not liable for.

169
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:26,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's sometimes just the way you're phrasing it.

170
00:16:26,562 --> 00:16:29,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, we're not liable for this, but you are liable for that.

171
00:16:29,084 --> 00:16:30,764
[SPEAKER_05]: It just sounds different.

172
00:16:30,904 --> 00:16:34,006
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same, but it does sound different to us.

173
00:16:39,324 --> 00:16:48,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Meetings of trustees, we said at least quarterly, and then special meetings can be called by the chair of the trust or any two trustees.

174
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:52,214
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there was a reason for a special meeting, that's how it would be done.

175
00:16:52,234 --> 00:16:55,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, we have to abide by open meeting law.

176
00:16:56,717 --> 00:17:03,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I said that we would annually elect officers, chair, vice chair, and treasurer, and that we can establish committees of need.

177
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:12,732
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we can adopt rules and regulations, you know, on top of these, if we want to, about more specific things.

178
00:17:12,752 --> 00:17:19,053
[SPEAKER_05]: These are kind of just, I'd say, more public-facing, you know, registered deed kind of level of things.

179
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:24,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Article 8 was about funds of the trust.

180
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:30,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, you know, just funds go into the trust.

181
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,656
[SPEAKER_05]: They remain trust property.

182
00:17:33,605 --> 00:17:34,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is also the ordinance.

183
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:41,768
[SPEAKER_05]: It said that the treasurer shall be the custodian of the trust funds, and I at first assumed it was going to be the Medford treasurer.

184
00:17:41,788 --> 00:17:43,108
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the city's treasurer.

185
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:48,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I might just specify that there.

186
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:53,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the only report we're going to have an annual audit

187
00:17:55,215 --> 00:18:04,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then that copy should be provided to the mayor and there was no other reports required to the city council going forward.

188
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:10,036
[SPEAKER_05]: But I didn't know if it should be, or if we're just going to kind of leave that as flexible.

189
00:18:12,288 --> 00:18:33,363
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is something that could be just business between the CPC and the trust, but I feel like it's a good practice in general to have an annual report that spells out what all of the revenues are and what everything we've spent funds are during the year.

190
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:38,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe like the template that I have for the

191
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:54,825
[SPEAKER_06]: The boards that I'm working with is a section on revenue and spending and a section that's reiterating goals.

192
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:59,167
[SPEAKER_06]: So just like, where are we in terms of the action plan?

193
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:05,129
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, what has happened over the past year?

194
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:08,630
[SPEAKER_06]: What are some major highlights that contextualize

195
00:19:09,678 --> 00:19:10,719
[SPEAKER_06]: what the trust is doing.

196
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:12,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

197
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:18,143
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think that would actually be more helpful than just a very dry audit.

198
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:19,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

199
00:19:19,843 --> 00:19:29,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I don't think that has to be specifically put in the declaration, but we could if we want to, or we could just do that and maybe put it in our rules and regulations.

200
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,891
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the idea of rules and regulations.

201
00:19:34,211 --> 00:19:34,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

202
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:36,172
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition to it.

203
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,102
[SPEAKER_07]: And I agree, an annual report, you have to show off what you did.

204
00:19:43,122 --> 00:19:46,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Show off what you did.

205
00:19:46,064 --> 00:20:04,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have a question about the audit and will the city of Medford's auditor be the ones performing the audit of the trust fund or will the trustees have to get their own auditor to do an audit?

206
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:09,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I should probably check that with the city treasurer if they do an annual audit.

207
00:20:09,268 --> 00:20:11,169
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they should do an annual audit.

208
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:11,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes.

209
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:13,190
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'll just confirm.

210
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

211
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:24,995
[SPEAKER_07]: I know in some of all the city, whoever is doing the city's audit, they do a separate audit of the... How does it say CPA?

212
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,042
[SPEAKER_06]: It has never really been on my radar how it happens.

213
00:20:33,383 --> 00:20:36,925
[SPEAKER_06]: So I imagine it just goes with the general city audit.

214
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:37,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

215
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:46,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Those trust you don't even have to think about it.

216
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:54,198
[SPEAKER_06]: CPA money is pre-council approval and housing trust money is post-council approval.

217
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:57,861
[SPEAKER_06]: So that might make a difference in

218
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:04,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you just elaborate on housing trust when you forced council approval?

219
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:12,802
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't have to, if we decide to spend money, we make the final decision and the money is spent.

220
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:19,528
[SPEAKER_06]: But CPA, if they decide they want to spend money, it has to go through the city council for approval.

221
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:22,310
[SPEAKER_06]: You make a recommendation.

222
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,173
[SPEAKER_06]: We make a recommendation and it goes to city council for approval.

223
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,841
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's Tracy here.

224
00:21:28,981 --> 00:21:33,683
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just add that our audit does follow with the regular city audit.

225
00:21:33,723 --> 00:21:39,326
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't hire a special side consultant or anything like that.

226
00:21:39,426 --> 00:21:40,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

227
00:21:47,611 --> 00:21:49,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

228
00:21:49,592 --> 00:21:51,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the next ones are pretty basic.

229
00:21:52,674 --> 00:21:54,695
[SPEAKER_05]: We're exempt from taxes.

230
00:21:54,755 --> 00:21:56,356
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a board of the city of Medford.

231
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,401
[SPEAKER_05]: The trust will be in existence until terminated.

232
00:22:00,421 --> 00:22:09,643
[SPEAKER_05]: If it is terminated, we're going to, the trust would continue until all the affairs are wrapped up in some way.

233
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:13,985
[SPEAKER_05]: This document will be recorded as Article 12.

234
00:22:15,805 --> 00:22:18,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, Article 13 amendments.

235
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:23,007
[SPEAKER_05]: So kind of a similar, somewhat similar question that we talked about before.

236
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:34,896
[SPEAKER_05]: So we could either have this be a unanimous provision, so all the trustees would have to agree to amend this trust, or definitely seen a supermajority.

237
00:22:34,956 --> 00:22:39,219
[SPEAKER_05]: So with seven trustees, that would be five voting for an amendment.

238
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:52,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't recall if that was in the ordinance either way, but I think either unanimously or a supermajority is the usual way for an amendment to this kind of document.

239
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:01,359
[SPEAKER_00]: That is pretty much it.

240
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:14,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a couple of questions for the Mayor and a couple for the Council.

241
00:23:14,783 --> 00:23:20,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

242
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:21,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions?

243
00:23:28,664 --> 00:23:53,874
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just comment on the very last thing that you gave about amendments that just try to give ourselves the most flexibility for seeing that something could go wrong in the future, or we might, if we need to exercise the right to make amendments, we probably want a super majority and just have a little wiggle room in case,

244
00:23:54,895 --> 00:23:57,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we should put it though in the rule and

245
00:24:22,475 --> 00:24:27,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think, um, this is, this is documents kind of laying out our powers.

246
00:24:27,658 --> 00:24:32,401
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this is kind of like everything that we want to do as a board.

247
00:24:32,422 --> 00:24:44,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and if we ever, I think even like, even spending time on it as a board does feel like, you know, we should get, um, that approved, you know, as, as board.

248
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:44,149
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

249
00:24:45,712 --> 00:24:54,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think if we want to have advocacy as part of the powers of the board, I do think we should have it in here as opposed to just the rules and regulations.

250
00:24:57,397 --> 00:25:02,679
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Penny, can you walk me through your vision of advocacy?

251
00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:09,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it like going down to the statehouse and advocating for more funds for whatever it is?

252
00:25:09,902 --> 00:25:14,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it advocating for a developer to come in

253
00:25:16,093 --> 00:25:17,334
[SPEAKER_07]: or fund it?

254
00:25:18,715 --> 00:25:19,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Great question.

255
00:25:19,335 --> 00:25:22,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess I was thinking of it in terms of policy advocacy.

256
00:25:22,957 --> 00:25:34,604
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you'd like, some things in the action plan might relate to like certain policies on either the local or state level that would work in tandem to either.

257
00:25:34,624 --> 00:25:41,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I just spitballing here, but like, for instance, the tenant opportunity for purchase, that's like sort of

258
00:25:42,513 --> 00:25:50,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Policies and being able to tie that to the funding or other things that we're also opening up so they can work like altogether.

259
00:25:50,956 --> 00:26:01,020
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just didn't want to not be able to do things that kind of making the point that, like, certain work we're doing would be really supported by certain policies on a different level.

260
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:06,962
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could read what was in Lexington just to give you a little guideline of what I saw.

261
00:26:07,773 --> 00:26:14,314
[SPEAKER_05]: So they had number 17, to make recommendations on proposals or town meeting warrant articles which affect housing.

262
00:26:14,334 --> 00:26:28,557
[SPEAKER_05]: 18, to develop policy goals and statements to serve as guidelines for the trust subject to approval by the select board and consistent with the town's housing goals and plans as may be adopted and amended by the select board from time to time.

263
00:26:28,617 --> 00:26:30,378
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've kind of already done that.

264
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:36,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it was really, it was kind of that first one in Lexington, at least.

265
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:43,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe with that knowledge in mind, I might say, like, it sounds like recommendations, right?

266
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:56,739
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to be setting our goals, and there might be certain policies or actions that are, would help us realize those that we, as a body that is studying and compiling and making, working towards those goals, would want to recommend.

267
00:26:56,819 --> 00:27:02,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to not cobble us to not have that ability, if we found that as something that we wanted to do.

268
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:27,462
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering if it's more like, well, you know, as a city employee, you can't, you can't go down and lobby for something at a state house.

269
00:27:27,482 --> 00:27:33,324
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what I was thinking when I'm thinking of what did you envision as advocacy?

270
00:27:33,424 --> 00:27:33,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

271
00:27:33,824 --> 00:27:36,405
[SPEAKER_03]: And the body of a lot of knowledge that also will be in play.

272
00:27:37,004 --> 00:27:39,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, gaining knowledge from lots of others as well.

273
00:27:39,685 --> 00:27:42,966
[SPEAKER_03]: So being able to then convey that, I think, is what I was thinking.

274
00:27:42,986 --> 00:27:47,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Use our capacity to support housing policy.

275
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:50,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I think in Medford specifically, right?

276
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that would make sense.

277
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:52,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

278
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:53,891
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, thanks.

279
00:27:53,991 --> 00:27:54,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

280
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:57,272
Yeah.

281
00:28:01,214 --> 00:28:03,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions or comments?

282
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:12,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so then we are going to go to the declaration of, nope, we just did that, sorry, the action plan.

283
00:28:13,882 --> 00:28:29,526
[SPEAKER_07]: And Roberta and Penny and myself have been working on the action plan, and I've asked either Penny and or Roberta to give an update.

284
00:28:30,846 --> 00:28:35,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll walk through the methodology that we've laid out.

285
00:28:36,096 --> 00:28:47,861
[SPEAKER_06]: So we begin with data collection, and we've looked at what are a range of data that might be helpful for to guide us help us to think about the city's affordable housing needs.

286
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:51,683
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we gather input from.

287
00:28:52,526 --> 00:28:58,468
[SPEAKER_06]: the Planning, Development and Sustainability is what PDS stands for.

288
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:07,850
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the department that NDT is a member of, Planning, Development and Sustainability.

289
00:29:09,171 --> 00:29:19,954
[SPEAKER_06]: So we gather input from their department about like what is the status of the housing production plan and the master plan implementation seeing as

290
00:29:20,614 --> 00:29:24,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Those two documents are a couple of years old now.

291
00:29:25,058 --> 00:29:26,559
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the progress that we've made?

292
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:42,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And what are some things that we see on the horizon that might be development opportunities or policy changes that we can anticipate in the next year or so?

293
00:29:44,335 --> 00:29:46,237
[SPEAKER_06]: So they'll provide us with that information.

294
00:29:46,257 --> 00:29:51,019
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all just part of the background for our planning purposes.

295
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we gather input from stakeholders.

296
00:29:54,702 --> 00:30:02,927
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll hold a small series of focus group meetings with regional affordable housing developers and service providers.

297
00:30:03,487 --> 00:30:11,072
[SPEAKER_06]: So the three of us will attend those meetings and then report back to you all what we've learned from them.

298
00:30:12,408 --> 00:30:16,591
[SPEAKER_06]: And so down at the bottom, we can see the timeline.

299
00:30:17,911 --> 00:30:35,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Those three things are the data collection input from PDS and stakeholder input are all to take place over the next three months so that we have that much completed by the end of the year.

300
00:30:35,402 --> 00:30:38,064
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll be gearing up for

301
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:48,597
[SPEAKER_06]: then in the new year, focusing more on thinking about the content of the action plan, thinking about what our action plan is actually going to look like.

302
00:30:49,218 --> 00:31:07,193
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll begin with a community meeting, presenting the market assessment and what we learned from PDS and stakeholders, and then ask for community input about what are the needs, priorities, and observations about

303
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:10,878
[SPEAKER_06]: the what they're experiencing in the housing market.

304
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:22,420
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we'll be preparing for that outreach meeting in December and then in January hold the outreach meeting.

305
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,381
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll begin a series of discussions amongst ourselves.

306
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:32,142
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll dedicate a series of meetings beginning in February.

307
00:31:34,911 --> 00:31:42,393
[SPEAKER_06]: February, March, maybe into April, to go over several topics together.

308
00:31:42,873 --> 00:31:48,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Our mission statement, goals, priority actions and guidelines, and procedures.

309
00:31:49,614 --> 00:31:55,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, what are the procedures that people will go through to obtain support from us?

310
00:31:57,076 --> 00:32:03,918
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll lay all of that out and discuss the drafts together over those two or three months.

311
00:32:04,518 --> 00:32:09,219
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll hold a second community meeting which we're targeting for April 2025.

312
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:21,363
[SPEAKER_06]: The second community meeting will be to review the draft of the plan that we've laid out and then we can make

313
00:32:22,572 --> 00:32:43,177
[SPEAKER_06]: any final changes based on what we learned from the community meeting, and then request a meeting with city council, the committee of the whole, to present the action plan, which at that point should hopefully be final, if this timeline works out for us.

314
00:32:43,197 --> 00:32:48,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Roberta.

315
00:32:50,115 --> 00:32:57,590
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've also provided an outline if we go to the next page of just kind of a general picture of.

316
00:32:58,097 --> 00:32:59,618
[SPEAKER_06]: what the action plan looks like.

317
00:32:59,939 --> 00:33:06,324
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have a background, which is really just saying, what is the Affordable Housing Trust and how did we get here?

318
00:33:07,164 --> 00:33:17,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the mission statement goals, describing what kind of funding we anticipate over the next five years, and then what are the priority actions that we're going to undertake.

319
00:33:18,614 --> 00:33:22,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the appendix is going to have all of the stuff that we learned,

320
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:29,530
[SPEAKER_06]: the contextual information data that we collected in the fall.

321
00:33:33,753 --> 00:33:36,415
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

322
00:33:37,035 --> 00:33:41,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody have any questions on the observations?

323
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:45,121
[SPEAKER_05]: I had one and that was only about the

324
00:33:48,237 --> 00:34:00,102
[SPEAKER_05]: stakeholder meetings, stakeholder input, if you were going to solicit names from the whole board, if you were going to come up with a list and then talk to the board?

325
00:34:00,662 --> 00:34:02,083
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a really good question.

326
00:34:02,103 --> 00:34:13,248
[SPEAKER_06]: We did just off the cuff generate a list, which Aditi is projecting on the screen right now.

327
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:15,869
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a long list of people to invite.

328
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:16,349
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wonder,

329
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:27,035
[SPEAKER_06]: whether it makes sense for us to just read through this list together and see if any of you can think of anything that we left out.

330
00:34:27,836 --> 00:34:31,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you want to increase the zoom in a little bit.

331
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:31,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

332
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:32,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

333
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:40,886
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, yeah, we can add to the list if there's anything that you can think of that we didn't.

334
00:34:41,587 --> 00:34:41,787
[SPEAKER_06]: So

335
00:34:43,176 --> 00:34:49,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford Community Housing, they've actually recently built a very small affordable housing development in Medford.

336
00:34:50,402 --> 00:34:55,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Housing Corporation of Arlington, kind of a similar very small organization.

337
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Preservation of Affordable Housing, POA.

338
00:34:59,512 --> 00:35:05,036
[SPEAKER_06]: They're currently building a large affordable housing development right up the street in Somerville.

339
00:35:06,477 --> 00:35:10,620
[SPEAKER_06]: The Neighborhood Developers is another regional affordable housing developer.

340
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Caribbean Integration Community Development.

341
00:35:16,305 --> 00:35:17,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I spoke with them one time.

342
00:35:17,926 --> 00:35:19,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for remembering them.

343
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:22,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they are interested.

344
00:35:22,169 --> 00:35:25,732
[SPEAKER_06]: They're a small CDC that's interested in

345
00:35:26,806 --> 00:35:36,074
[SPEAKER_06]: expanding regionally and provide, you know, seeing if they can partner with communities to provide some services.

346
00:35:36,855 --> 00:35:43,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Metro North Housing Corporation is a regional housing developer that's working kind of to the east and north of us.

347
00:35:43,961 --> 00:35:44,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Malden.

348
00:35:45,802 --> 00:35:46,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Malden, yeah.

349
00:35:47,423 --> 00:35:50,206
[SPEAKER_06]: The Medford Housing Authority

350
00:35:52,654 --> 00:36:01,017
[SPEAKER_06]: And then some service providers, housing stability, youth, childcare, employment services, serving unhoused population, community teamwork.

351
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:07,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't recall, like the name is familiar and I don't remember where community teamwork is working.

352
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Newton.

353
00:36:09,822 --> 00:36:10,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

354
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:10,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

355
00:36:10,742 --> 00:36:12,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I have, I think there's one in Lowell.

356
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:13,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

357
00:36:13,703 --> 00:36:13,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

358
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:27,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Housing families currently, housing families and ABCD currently operate housing stability programs funded by the Community Preservation Act.

359
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:39,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Justice Start is a non-profit organization in Cambridge that does services and housing development.

360
00:36:39,968 --> 00:36:44,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Metro Housing Boston, they provide some services.

361
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:46,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Caritas Communities, currently they have

362
00:36:47,731 --> 00:36:59,401
[SPEAKER_06]: They're an affordable housing organization that specializes in single room occupancy, and they currently have a site in Medford.

363
00:37:00,282 --> 00:37:03,985
[SPEAKER_06]: They might be interested in developing another site in Medford.

364
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:07,728
[SPEAKER_06]: CAS, Community Action Agency of Somerville,

365
00:37:08,785 --> 00:37:15,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Respond, which is an organization that addresses victims of domestic violence in Somerville.

366
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:21,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Heading Home is another service provider in Somerville.

367
00:37:22,038 --> 00:37:23,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Somerville Homeless Coalition.

368
00:37:24,521 --> 00:37:30,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Wayside Youth and Family Support Network, which interestingly has a

369
00:37:30,828 --> 00:37:46,381
[SPEAKER_06]: essentially a homeless shelter that's just up the street from us and very close to another homeless shelter, which I forgot to put on the list of another organization that we might want to reach out to, which is Volunteers of America.

370
00:37:47,662 --> 00:37:50,844
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking that as I was looking at the listing.

371
00:37:50,924 --> 00:37:52,285
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to correct.

372
00:37:52,345 --> 00:37:53,987
[SPEAKER_07]: It offers a tiny

373
00:37:54,763 --> 00:37:57,564
[SPEAKER_07]: at it, they don't, it's not in a homeless shelter.

374
00:37:57,584 --> 00:38:01,985
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually have permanent supportive housing and it's transitional housing.

375
00:38:02,045 --> 00:38:07,087
[SPEAKER_07]: So transitional is a timeframe up to two years they're able to stay.

376
00:38:07,107 --> 00:38:09,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that.

377
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:12,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And they also have an office right here in Medford Square too.

378
00:38:13,189 --> 00:38:16,750
[SPEAKER_06]: So another reason why they might be interested in working with us.

379
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:22,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Bread of Life, an organization in Malden,

380
00:38:24,749 --> 00:38:30,051
[SPEAKER_06]: And Housing Medford is just a local advocacy group.

381
00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:35,812
[SPEAKER_06]: And Medford Council on Aging and Mystic Valley Elder Services.

382
00:38:36,813 --> 00:38:37,033
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

383
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:38,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

384
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:48,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Greater Boston Legal Services, because Medford is in their coverage area for including legal groups with a housing event there.

385
00:38:49,257 --> 00:38:50,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

386
00:38:50,717 --> 00:38:52,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it the Greater Boston Legal Services?

387
00:38:52,558 --> 00:38:52,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

388
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:53,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

389
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:58,622
[SPEAKER_03]: and DeNovo Legal Services.

390
00:38:58,782 --> 00:39:00,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if their service area covers Medford.

391
00:39:01,004 --> 00:39:02,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I can double check and let you know.

392
00:39:02,845 --> 00:39:09,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that Housing Families has provided pro bono legal services to our residents.

393
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:12,673
[SPEAKER_08]: I just didn't want to repeat the names that they provided services to.

394
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:16,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thanks, Alyssa.

395
00:39:16,737 --> 00:39:17,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Alyssa's great.

396
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:22,562
[SPEAKER_05]: The company I work for has been involved in Caritas before.

397
00:39:23,717 --> 00:39:25,859
[SPEAKER_05]: don't get an answer from them, feel free to let me know.

398
00:39:25,939 --> 00:39:27,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I could ping them as well.

399
00:39:28,581 --> 00:39:36,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just maybe advocate for the addition of one or two more on the development side.

400
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:37,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you have a great list.

401
00:39:37,988 --> 00:39:46,435
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all incredibly knowledgeable, but I think when we're talking about housing supply, I think, you know,

402
00:39:47,577 --> 00:39:52,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Having a for-profit developer in the mix might be just an option.

403
00:39:52,198 --> 00:39:59,039
[SPEAKER_05]: And even just a lot of 40B developers are really market rate developers, but they do produce a lot of housing.

404
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:09,661
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want, I can think about it and submit one or two names that I think might be a good fit as well, just to add to the numerous list.

405
00:40:09,981 --> 00:40:11,341
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an organization.

406
00:40:11,361 --> 00:40:12,061
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it called?

407
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:13,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Beacon Properties?

408
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:14,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that who it is?

409
00:40:14,222 --> 00:40:15,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Beacon Properties is really good.

410
00:40:15,942 --> 00:40:16,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I agree.

411
00:40:17,212 --> 00:40:21,973
[SPEAKER_07]: when development is coming into Somerville fairly soon, taking over the DNA.

412
00:40:22,273 --> 00:40:24,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, then, yeah, let's include them, too.

413
00:40:24,254 --> 00:40:26,174
[SPEAKER_07]: All of those, I think, are top options.

414
00:40:26,454 --> 00:40:26,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

415
00:40:28,235 --> 00:40:30,255
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are a few of those that I'm not.

416
00:40:30,275 --> 00:40:34,536
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bunch, but it's hard to remember them all.

417
00:40:34,836 --> 00:40:41,658
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another non-profit one that I see a lot, though, Community Builders.

418
00:40:42,038 --> 00:40:43,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, yes, yes, yes.

419
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:44,839
[SPEAKER_00]: And then arts.

420
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:50,349
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Habitat.

421
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:53,790
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also not for profit, but they do a lot of work.

422
00:40:55,171 --> 00:40:57,151
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is E3.

423
00:40:57,571 --> 00:41:00,752
[SPEAKER_07]: They just did a development in Somerville.

424
00:41:01,052 --> 00:41:03,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot the woman's name.

425
00:41:05,242 --> 00:41:06,703
[SPEAKER_07]: It will come to me late tonight.

426
00:41:06,803 --> 00:41:07,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Lisa.

427
00:41:07,864 --> 00:41:08,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Elisa?

428
00:41:08,605 --> 00:41:10,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Elisa, yes.

429
00:41:11,647 --> 00:41:13,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it Davis Square Architects?

430
00:41:14,009 --> 00:41:14,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

431
00:41:14,589 --> 00:41:14,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

432
00:41:15,149 --> 00:41:16,751
[SPEAKER_06]: They do a lot of work.

433
00:41:16,811 --> 00:41:17,691
[SPEAKER_06]: They do a lot of work.

434
00:41:17,932 --> 00:41:18,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

435
00:41:18,572 --> 00:41:18,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

436
00:41:20,694 --> 00:41:31,462
[SPEAKER_06]: So it might be, yeah, we may not reach all of them, but we can at least send out an invitation and see how many we're able to plug in.

437
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:31,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

438
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:34,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for that.

439
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

440
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:47,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we just went over the stakeholders.

441
00:41:47,226 --> 00:42:00,153
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually have some follow-up question on the stakeholder groups and preparing an email and reaching out.

442
00:42:01,392 --> 00:42:04,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's that lucky person that's going to do all that?

443
00:42:04,534 --> 00:42:06,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I looking at it?

444
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:10,979
[SPEAKER_08]: I can do that as long as we have a template.

445
00:42:11,439 --> 00:42:11,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

446
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:15,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I was also going to ask about funding.

447
00:42:15,061 --> 00:42:17,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we doing any physical flyers?

448
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:26,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something the city would cover cost-wise or would the trust need it so we fund this?

449
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,332
[SPEAKER_08]: If we are planning to translate them, then

450
00:42:30,936 --> 00:42:36,945
[SPEAKER_08]: you'd have to pick it up some funding sources because you don't have that ability at this point.

451
00:42:38,867 --> 00:42:45,271
[SPEAKER_08]: especially for community outreach, but for stakeholder engagement, I'm not sure if you do want to have them translated.

452
00:42:45,391 --> 00:42:45,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, right.

453
00:42:45,812 --> 00:42:46,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

454
00:42:46,092 --> 00:42:46,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

455
00:42:46,212 --> 00:42:49,354
[SPEAKER_08]: I was I was thinking more of the community.

456
00:42:49,454 --> 00:42:51,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we should have to ask.

457
00:42:51,075 --> 00:42:51,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

458
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:59,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, so does the city of Medford have a department that helps with translation services?

459
00:42:59,301 --> 00:42:59,601
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

460
00:42:59,942 --> 00:43:00,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

461
00:43:00,522 --> 00:43:00,642
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

462
00:43:00,922 --> 00:43:02,003
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

463
00:43:02,604 --> 00:43:07,287
[SPEAKER_06]: There are community liaisons under the health department.

464
00:43:08,258 --> 00:43:15,423
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can work with them to try to reach the communities that they're liaising to.

465
00:43:16,704 --> 00:43:28,091
[SPEAKER_06]: So that, you know, it's not quite on the level of having translation services, but we can do some targeted outreach.

466
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:37,477
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make sure that when we're doing the community meetings and getting the feedback from the community that we're able to communicate

467
00:43:40,261 --> 00:43:50,908
[SPEAKER_06]: What we might want to do is incorporate into our timeline meetings with each of the community liaisons.

468
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:58,955
[SPEAKER_06]: to ask them to do outreach with their communities.

469
00:43:59,015 --> 00:44:13,785
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe they can see if they can even just make a small focus group and just bring together a handful of people who are in their outreach communities who'd be willing to talk with us.

470
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:18,529
[SPEAKER_06]: So we could try to have brief

471
00:44:20,014 --> 00:44:27,356
[SPEAKER_06]: small meetings with them, in addition to our community meeting, to ask for their input on the needs.

472
00:44:29,056 --> 00:44:38,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been speaking with the DT about what support the city can offer in terms of outreach for the community meetings, so I'm happy to continue those conversations.

473
00:44:38,378 --> 00:44:48,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I think translation is a great question on accessibility questions, spatial questions, all the gamut, but I'm happy to work with you to help figure those out.

474
00:44:49,918 --> 00:44:55,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe our next meeting we'll have some updates.

475
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll run out of ideas.

476
00:44:57,601 --> 00:44:59,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone has some great ideas.

477
00:44:59,962 --> 00:45:04,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to remember the update, I think Ameya is online.

478
00:45:07,285 --> 00:45:10,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, Ameya.

479
00:45:11,966 --> 00:45:12,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, good evening.

480
00:45:13,107 --> 00:45:13,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry I'm late.

481
00:45:16,163 --> 00:45:18,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Did we want to just revisit some?

482
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, a couple of them.

483
00:45:21,465 --> 00:45:26,648
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had a couple pending questions from the Declaration of Trust.

484
00:45:27,988 --> 00:45:31,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just point it out now.

485
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:36,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the first one might be article three, number five.

486
00:45:36,912 --> 00:45:42,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops, not four, sorry, four, four, circled the wrong one, number four.

487
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:50,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, article three, number four, excuse me.

488
00:45:50,537 --> 00:46:00,585
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was taken from the ordinance, and it just says that any member of the board may be removed by the mayor for cause after the opportunity of a hearing.

489
00:46:00,605 --> 00:46:09,232
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't know if we needed some more details there about what the hearing might entail, or if there was already a process or procedure in place

490
00:46:11,084 --> 00:46:15,046
[SPEAKER_05]: that I could reference, I think some amount of detail here might be useful.

491
00:46:22,528 --> 00:46:23,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Mia, can you hear us?

492
00:46:25,114 --> 00:46:26,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're asking me this question.

493
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:34,524
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way I can remove somebody from a border commission is through cause.

494
00:46:35,445 --> 00:46:39,289
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would just be, I believe it would just be a letter.

495
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:42,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I don't think I've had to do that.

496
00:46:42,913 --> 00:46:44,975
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have specific information for you.

497
00:46:44,995 --> 00:46:46,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

498
00:46:48,310 --> 00:47:00,978
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I guess, Madam Mayor, the question was, in addition to, for the reasons was, is there an outline of what the hearing, who participates in the hearing?

499
00:47:00,998 --> 00:47:08,843
[SPEAKER_07]: If somebody was removed for cause, it says that they do have, they will have an opportunity for a hearing.

500
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:14,412
[SPEAKER_07]: So would that be the city council, trustees?

501
00:47:14,892 --> 00:47:16,633
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not the way it's written.

502
00:47:17,013 --> 00:47:22,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the way it's written because it says that the mayor shall remove with a hearing.

503
00:47:22,935 --> 00:47:33,620
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would think it would be some sort of committee, I don't know.

504
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

505
00:47:36,781 --> 00:47:38,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll kick this over to

506
00:47:38,905 --> 00:47:39,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll leave the comments at that.

507
00:47:40,146 --> 00:47:40,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

508
00:47:42,448 --> 00:47:49,354
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think the only other question that we had was from article four, number three.

509
00:47:49,374 --> 00:47:54,659
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was a limitation that I think was specific to our city council.

510
00:47:54,679 --> 00:48:01,444
[SPEAKER_05]: They asked that any sale of real property having an area of more than 7,500 square feet

511
00:48:03,617 --> 00:48:06,859
[SPEAKER_05]: has to be subject to the approval of the city council.

512
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:14,345
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they didn't specify if that was gonna be a majority, a super majority or some sort of unanimous votes.

513
00:48:14,405 --> 00:48:21,029
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't know if you had any idea of what they might want there or what they meant there.

514
00:48:21,049 --> 00:48:28,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you have to put any specifics in because they already need to approve any sale of property as it is.

515
00:48:29,295 --> 00:48:31,597
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would follow the general legal process.

516
00:48:33,908 --> 00:48:47,518
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think if there's land that is given to us or that we control, I don't, unless it's over the 7,500 square feet as our board, we might be able to dispose of it ourselves without their approval.

517
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:53,002
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've limited themselves to what approval rights they have.

518
00:48:55,664 --> 00:49:01,488
[SPEAKER_05]: But normally if it's a piece of real property that goes through city council, is it a unanimous vote by city council?

519
00:49:04,717 --> 00:49:06,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not believe it's unanimous.

520
00:49:06,898 --> 00:49:07,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

521
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:12,560
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I want to keep a majority for now.

522
00:49:14,101 --> 00:49:24,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can give you get specifics for you for the next meeting we're working with an attorney right now to potentially sell to smaller parcels up on McCormick.

523
00:49:25,835 --> 00:49:37,398
[SPEAKER_02]: that could potentially, it's a lot of ledge, but there is abutters that are interested, and I think it would be a great way to put funding into the Affordable Housing Trust.

524
00:49:37,578 --> 00:49:47,520
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do have an attorney working on that now, so I could get more specifics on exactly what the council needs to vote on, and if it's by majority or not.

525
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,920
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's definitely not unanimous.

526
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.

527
00:49:53,321 --> 00:49:53,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

528
00:49:56,766 --> 00:50:06,390
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so that brings us back to the CPA application and NDTs will provide us with an update of the application that was submitted.

529
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:07,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for that.

530
00:50:08,671 --> 00:50:16,815
[SPEAKER_08]: So we submitted the CPA application on September 9th and we have a presentation on October 22nd.

531
00:50:16,855 --> 00:50:22,057
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to go over the outline of what the presentation may look like.

532
00:50:23,973 --> 00:50:25,554
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is an outline.

533
00:50:25,574 --> 00:50:33,960
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking we can just introduce affordable housing trust and then it was established and how many meetings we've had so far.

534
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:42,906
[SPEAKER_08]: And then probably with the help of data, identify the need for affordable housing and then update them that are working groups.

535
00:50:43,427 --> 00:50:47,215
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the action plan, what's the status and the declaration of trust.

536
00:50:47,496 --> 00:50:53,810
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure declaration of trust is necessary, but definitely action plan may be helpful just to update them with the status.

537
00:50:54,995 --> 00:51:01,137
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, sorry, these are the five potential projects that we mentioned in the application.

538
00:51:01,537 --> 00:51:04,577
[SPEAKER_08]: So probably have a slide for each of these projects.

539
00:51:05,238 --> 00:51:10,559
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the scope and budget, which you're all seeing, will probably be added to the presentation.

540
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:14,620
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the letters of support that will proceed from three different parties.

541
00:51:16,916 --> 00:51:25,622
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition to that, our application also included some city-owned lots that could be potentially used for affordable housing developments.

542
00:51:28,063 --> 00:51:29,985
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the Fulton Street plots.

543
00:51:30,305 --> 00:51:40,772
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been some study done on this, and there are developers who are interested in building 100% affordable home ownership in this lot.

544
00:51:42,927 --> 00:51:46,368
[SPEAKER_08]: And another one is Ciro Riverside.

545
00:51:46,408 --> 00:51:52,290
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a city-owned lot, and it's sort of landlocked because there's the expressway.

546
00:51:53,230 --> 00:52:03,954
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Everding property is interested in acquiring this and building development that includes 25% affordable housing.

547
00:52:04,674 --> 00:52:07,095
[SPEAKER_08]: So something that we could probably explore.

548
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:22,421
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have two city-owned lots on 0 Gailey Street, and then there's a land in between, which was on sale earlier last month, if I'm not wrong.

549
00:52:23,461 --> 00:52:32,068
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if it's still on sale or if the owner is interested to sell this property, but this would be something that the trust would look into.

550
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:37,032
[SPEAKER_08]: And then these are just city-owned lots

551
00:52:39,007 --> 00:52:44,349
[SPEAKER_08]: are sort of ambiguous and would allow for a larger development.

552
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:46,510
[SPEAKER_08]: But this has not been in the conversation.

553
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:53,573
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just something that Teresa suggested.

554
00:52:53,633 --> 00:52:56,254
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we have included that here as well.

555
00:52:59,216 --> 00:52:59,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

556
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:11,836
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I'm not mistaken, you were looking for trustees to accompany you at the October 22nd meeting, correct?

557
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:14,318
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be great.

558
00:53:14,999 --> 00:53:17,401
[SPEAKER_08]: If not all, just one or two.

559
00:53:17,921 --> 00:53:21,424
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that Roberta is going to be there, but she's going to recuse herself.

560
00:53:21,764 --> 00:53:24,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't say you'll have to vote for her.

561
00:53:24,447 --> 00:53:24,647
[SPEAKER_07]: The 22nd.

562
00:53:24,747 --> 00:53:25,547
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably can.

563
00:53:31,606 --> 00:53:42,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I think technically, but it's been the practice of the CPC to not vote for vote for your own board.

564
00:53:42,557 --> 00:53:49,084
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think you technically are allowed to, because as long as they're both for the city, you're still representing the city.

565
00:53:51,086 --> 00:53:53,048
[SPEAKER_05]: What time is the meeting on the 22nd?

566
00:53:54,832 --> 00:53:56,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Theresa, could you help me with that?

567
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,513
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember the timing.

568
00:53:57,533 --> 00:53:57,513
6.30.

569
00:53:58,714 --> 00:54:00,515
[SPEAKER_08]: 6.30.

570
00:53:58,754 --> 00:54:00,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

571
00:54:01,135 --> 00:54:01,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

572
00:54:01,755 --> 00:54:07,358
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that you are one of the first applicants that evening, just to have that be a factor.

573
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:09,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Theresa.

574
00:54:09,158 --> 00:54:10,659
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, too, have blocked it off.

575
00:54:10,699 --> 00:54:10,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

576
00:54:11,019 --> 00:54:15,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I can make it, but I'll let you know if I make it.

577
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:25,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

578
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:32,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I might be able to come directly from tennis, so I will be sweating.

579
00:54:32,325 --> 00:54:40,730
[SPEAKER_08]: At the DPW office, I can send you the details.

580
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,693
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually a nice meeting room at the DPW office.

581
00:54:44,773 --> 00:54:45,934
[SPEAKER_06]: It's bigger than this.

582
00:54:46,054 --> 00:54:50,357
[SPEAKER_06]: It has a table and a bigger audience area.

583
00:54:51,408 --> 00:54:53,170
[SPEAKER_06]: And we even learned how the light switch works.

584
00:54:54,711 --> 00:54:59,615
[SPEAKER_06]: It did take us, it took me, you know, 90 minutes to figure it out.

585
00:54:59,635 --> 00:55:01,336
[SPEAKER_00]: We made it.

586
00:55:02,217 --> 00:55:05,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Got some sophisticated lights over there.

587
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,602
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, thank you.

588
00:55:09,843 --> 00:55:10,864
[SPEAKER_07]: And I lost mine.

589
00:55:10,884 --> 00:55:16,509
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so we are on item five, finances.

590
00:55:18,368 --> 00:55:25,193
[SPEAKER_07]: going to discuss the potential funding sources and questions raised by Shelly from MPMHP.

591
00:55:26,534 --> 00:55:29,657
[SPEAKER_07]: And she, that's the email that you sent on the various?

592
00:55:30,418 --> 00:55:33,800
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've just included the questions, not the entire email.

593
00:55:40,185 --> 00:55:42,967
[SPEAKER_07]: You want me to read them all through or do we want?

594
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:43,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

595
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:49,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so the first question is initiating a fee such as linkage is citywide effort.

596
00:55:49,751 --> 00:55:52,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it appropriate for the trust to initiate this effort?

597
00:55:55,672 --> 00:56:03,933
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's going to be dependent on the the input that we get from PDS because I know that you've been working on this.

598
00:56:04,633 --> 00:56:07,994
[SPEAKER_06]: So is that is there like this is where we want to advocate.

599
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:13,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a role for us in helping to advocate for the

600
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:20,280
[SPEAKER_06]: linkage fee or is it something that's already sufficiently baked?

601
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:38,866
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we are moving towards, as Mayor mentioned that the Mayor is also working on it and so we are also looking towards potential funding sources and then eventually we will draft the RFP and probably the trust can provide inputs on that.

602
00:56:39,106 --> 00:56:39,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

603
00:56:39,506 --> 00:56:39,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

604
00:56:43,955 --> 00:56:46,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Are people like the nexus study?

605
00:56:47,076 --> 00:56:59,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is an example of where the trust would want to be involved in advocacy to guide the effort to create a linkage fee and to get it passed.

606
00:57:02,021 --> 00:57:09,943
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not involved in this because I trust that something is initiating the study, but it could be wrong.

607
00:57:09,983 --> 00:57:11,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, might be.

608
00:57:11,444 --> 00:57:11,824
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

609
00:57:13,807 --> 00:57:20,112
[SPEAKER_08]: The second question is if linkage were to be instated and not good, would all of the funds be directed to the trust?

610
00:57:20,793 --> 00:57:26,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not, because currently we have linkage fees that go to a number of other sources.

611
00:57:26,478 --> 00:57:34,084
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're not going to win any friends by redirecting all of that to the Affordable Housing Trust.

612
00:57:34,364 --> 00:57:36,866
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's only going to be the Affordable Housing Linkage.

613
00:57:37,227 --> 00:57:37,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

614
00:57:40,383 --> 00:57:44,185
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so I just want to wrap my head around one thing that we're talking about.

615
00:57:44,205 --> 00:57:47,687
[SPEAKER_07]: So the city of Medford already has linkage fees.

616
00:57:47,967 --> 00:57:59,954
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we're talking about initiating another linkage fee citywide to benefit the affordable housing trust funds.

617
00:58:00,474 --> 00:58:02,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so then question number two would be,

618
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:06,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it would come all the way to the trust, right?

619
00:58:06,642 --> 00:58:06,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

620
00:58:06,802 --> 00:58:11,227
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, to be more Medford specific, so we already currently have a linkage fees, but it's a very old ordinance that really

621
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:51,067
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't work all that well to our benefit anymore and for complicated reasons we haven't been able to update it because we need to have a nexus plan and we are working on putting out an rp for the nexus plan and retaining a consultant but that's been much more complicated than anticipated so we're really looking at adding affordable housing to the linkage to the existing linkage program

622
00:58:52,067 --> 00:58:55,610
[SPEAKER_06]: But also it needs to be overhauled anyway.

623
00:58:56,992 --> 00:59:00,895
[SPEAKER_07]: So, again, I need to wrap my head around it because it's spinning at the moment.

624
00:59:01,716 --> 00:59:01,816
[SPEAKER_07]: It's.

625
00:59:03,723 --> 00:59:10,805
[SPEAKER_07]: instead of two separate linkage fees, it would be one, we look, I'm hearing two different things.

626
00:59:10,905 --> 00:59:21,367
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hearing we're looking to do a separate linkage fee for the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, and if that's the case, it would go all to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

627
00:59:21,827 --> 00:59:32,090
[SPEAKER_07]: But then I'm also hearing that we already have a linkage fee on the books in Medford that the study, the NEXUS study is looking, hopefully,

628
00:59:33,216 --> 00:59:45,524
[SPEAKER_07]: is to be able to expand the usage and or the ability, the funds, where the funds are coming from, expand that, and then the usage.

629
00:59:45,544 --> 00:59:50,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I could provide some context just to take a few steps back.

630
00:59:50,568 --> 00:59:56,872
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have an act that allows Medford to adopt a linkage fee.

631
00:59:57,473 --> 00:59:58,713
[SPEAKER_08]: And currently we have

632
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,060
[SPEAKER_08]: if I'm not wrong, four different buckets.

633
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:11,583
[SPEAKER_08]: There's police and fire, water and sewer, parks and recreation, and then there's traffic.

634
01:00:13,123 --> 01:00:17,585
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are the different buckets under which we are collecting our linkage fee.

635
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:24,687
[SPEAKER_08]: The Act allows us to adopt affordable housing linkage, but we do not have that in the ordinance yet.

636
01:00:28,354 --> 01:00:43,048
[SPEAKER_08]: issue with the ordinance is that it says that we have to review the linkage fee every three years and we have not done that since 30 years, since the time it was adopted.

637
01:00:43,068 --> 01:00:50,435
[SPEAKER_08]: An issue with that timeline that every three years we need to review this linkage is that in other communities they review it

638
01:00:51,135 --> 01:01:03,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Every 5 years, and then we review the linkage fee, we have to do a next study, which would sort of ensure that we do not face any legal challenges with the fee that we impose.

639
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:11,384
[SPEAKER_08]: So every three years would be, would include, yeah, it's very costly to do that.

640
01:01:11,704 --> 01:01:24,632
[SPEAKER_08]: And based on interaction with our potential consultants, a Nexus study that would review the existing linkage as well as include affordable housing linkage would cost $200,000.

641
01:01:25,173 --> 01:01:31,036
[SPEAKER_08]: So spending that much every three years is a challenge.

642
01:01:31,196 --> 01:01:34,038
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are trying to amend the act

643
01:01:34,852 --> 01:01:38,718
[SPEAKER_08]: To review the linkage being every 7 to 10 years.

644
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:44,046
[SPEAKER_08]: So currently we are in state to the act.

645
01:01:44,266 --> 01:01:44,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

646
01:01:45,709 --> 01:01:47,431
[SPEAKER_08]: And the 2nd option is.

647
01:01:49,728 --> 01:01:57,055
[SPEAKER_08]: we may not update the existing linkage, but do a nexus study to add affordable housing linkage.

648
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:00,698
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would cost us $60,000 to $80,000.

649
01:02:01,178 --> 01:02:15,110
[SPEAKER_08]: This study will also include reviewing our current inclusionary zoning ordinance and see if we can include cash in lieu instead of just providing equitable units.

650
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:17,371
[SPEAKER_08]: a fractional payment.

651
01:02:17,531 --> 01:02:18,932
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have that in our ordinance.

652
01:02:19,572 --> 01:02:22,013
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are the two routes that we could consider.

653
01:02:22,033 --> 01:02:24,815
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's $200,000 and then there's the $80,000 fee.

654
01:02:24,935 --> 01:02:25,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

655
01:02:28,616 --> 01:02:32,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one is the city leading towards?

656
01:02:33,339 --> 01:02:35,280
[SPEAKER_08]: We are figuring that out.

657
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:39,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the first step is to amend the Act.

658
01:02:41,343 --> 01:02:44,645
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, as Mayor mentioned, we are also looking at

659
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:53,203
[SPEAKER_08]: figuring out how to add funding to the trust by identifying certain city-owned lots as well.

660
01:02:53,263 --> 01:02:57,264
[SPEAKER_08]: So, hopefully that will provide some funding to Lewiston.

661
01:02:58,064 --> 01:03:02,526
[SPEAKER_07]: And just out of curiosity, amending the current linkage act.

662
01:03:02,566 --> 01:03:02,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

663
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:05,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I heard you say State House.

664
01:03:05,647 --> 01:03:08,168
[SPEAKER_07]: So, is that a home rule petition?

665
01:03:08,668 --> 01:03:11,469
[SPEAKER_08]: That was in the discussion at the City Council meeting.

666
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:11,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

667
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:12,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

668
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:12,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

669
01:03:13,502 --> 01:03:14,323
[SPEAKER_07]: That takes a while.

670
01:03:14,363 --> 01:03:16,966
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had something in summer for quite some time.

671
01:03:17,046 --> 01:03:25,674
[SPEAKER_08]: If that takes a while, one solution is just to do a next study to add affordable housing linkage.

672
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people still do that.

673
01:03:28,317 --> 01:03:34,103
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you do that, would you then be on the three-year update route?

674
01:03:35,805 --> 01:03:39,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yeah, that's a good question.

675
01:03:39,769 --> 01:03:44,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Just less than a three year cycle and some other parts of the ordinance, like the structure.

676
01:03:44,313 --> 01:03:52,240
[SPEAKER_03]: So just kind of sticking in the structure is there that it could work that that money could then come possibly just do the next day for housing to get it.

677
01:03:52,321 --> 01:03:52,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

678
01:03:52,541 --> 01:03:53,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, the actor loves.

679
01:03:54,543 --> 01:04:03,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to be clear, the act allows us to add affordable housing linkage, and then probably the ordinance should outline that and directly go to the trust.

680
01:04:04,293 --> 01:04:04,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

681
01:04:04,934 --> 01:04:05,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

682
01:04:07,817 --> 01:04:08,238
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

683
01:04:08,258 --> 01:04:12,022
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we've answered the first three questions.

684
01:04:17,912 --> 01:04:18,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Question 4.

685
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:21,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there another way to fund the trust through a more traditional channel?

686
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:24,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Example related city department?

687
01:04:25,281 --> 01:04:28,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, these are Shelly's questions.

688
01:04:28,544 --> 01:04:32,709
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's meant to help us.

689
01:04:32,729 --> 01:04:34,050
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think you mentioned.

690
01:04:34,751 --> 01:04:52,945
[SPEAKER_06]: an option earlier that could potentially help to fund the trust, which is selling city-owned land that's not a candidate for affordable housing, but the proceeds could go to the trust?

691
01:04:54,446 --> 01:04:55,887
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not very clear on that.

692
01:04:56,027 --> 01:04:59,569
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if Madam Mayor would like to add to that.

693
01:04:59,609 --> 01:05:04,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Mayor, do you have any thoughts on that?

694
01:05:04,588 --> 01:05:05,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you just repeat the question, please?

695
01:05:06,929 --> 01:05:21,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether a possible source of funding is if there is land that the city is disposing of that's not appropriate for affordable housing, could the proceeds of selling that land go to the Affordable Housing Trust?

696
01:05:27,837 --> 01:05:28,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

697
01:05:29,977 --> 01:05:31,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's what I'm doing with McCormick.

698
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:32,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.

699
01:05:33,149 --> 01:05:33,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

700
01:05:33,409 --> 01:05:34,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

701
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:42,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a balance of, like Aditi mentioned, we're looking at a bunch of different city-owned parcels.

702
01:05:43,234 --> 01:05:56,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Some we would like to maybe build affordable housing on, and then others, my hope is we do a mix of also including the sale of some of these lots so that we can add funding to the Affordable Housing Trust.

703
01:05:58,662 --> 01:05:58,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

704
01:05:58,982 --> 01:05:59,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

705
01:05:59,702 --> 01:06:00,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

706
01:06:00,443 --> 01:06:00,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

707
01:06:04,143 --> 01:06:08,885
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is, was it a mail tax or some other thing that you had mentioned?

708
01:06:08,905 --> 01:06:11,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, madame.

709
01:06:11,086 --> 01:06:13,826
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the city of Medford have a mail tax.

710
01:06:18,048 --> 01:06:18,588
[SPEAKER_07]: I should know.

711
01:06:18,628 --> 01:06:22,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, all the time and I never look at it.

712
01:06:23,129 --> 01:06:28,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, we have hotels tax and mails tax and that that funding goes into the general fund.

713
01:06:28,731 --> 01:06:30,692
[SPEAKER_07]: It does, but I yeah.

714
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:49,602
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was sharing with Penny that a number of conferences that I've gone to for the unhoused in different parts of the country, they actually use a portion of the mail tax to

715
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:55,412
[SPEAKER_07]: subsidize or fund housing programs.

716
01:06:55,793 --> 01:07:01,315
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering if we didn't have one, could we put one and then we could bring it right into the affordable housing?

717
01:07:01,496 --> 01:07:02,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Short-term rentals?

718
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:04,477
[SPEAKER_06]: We have them, excuse me.

719
01:07:04,697 --> 01:07:05,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Short-term rentals.

720
01:07:06,038 --> 01:07:13,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a fee for short-term rental registration and could that go to... Oh, like Airbnb?

721
01:07:13,542 --> 01:07:13,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

722
01:07:14,382 --> 01:07:14,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

723
01:07:15,643 --> 01:07:20,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any restrictions around short-term rentals?

724
01:07:22,106 --> 01:07:25,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there are some restrictions on that.

725
01:07:25,188 --> 01:07:25,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

726
01:07:26,489 --> 01:07:28,310
[SPEAKER_08]: But we do have restrictions.

727
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:29,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

728
01:07:29,951 --> 01:07:37,856
[SPEAKER_06]: So are we, do we already or are we allowed to charge a fee or a tax on short-term rentals?

729
01:07:38,216 --> 01:07:40,758
[SPEAKER_06]: And could that go to the affordable housing trust?

730
01:07:42,339 --> 01:07:45,881
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to look at the arguments before I see something.

731
01:07:46,061 --> 01:07:49,123
[SPEAKER_08]: But me, Madam Mayor, may have some inputs on that.

732
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,264
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was going to say the same thing.

733
01:07:51,284 --> 01:08:00,490
[SPEAKER_02]: We can check out the ordinance and we can also see if the building commissioner has any insight or experience in anything, you know, in fees that we could potentially collect.

734
01:08:00,891 --> 01:08:03,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would assume we have to adjust the ordinance if need be.

735
01:08:06,955 --> 01:08:11,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if it would require a rental registry to be able to also monitor that.

736
01:08:11,499 --> 01:08:12,340
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.

737
01:08:12,821 --> 01:08:13,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

738
01:08:13,261 --> 01:08:24,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe, I mean, a short-term rental registry, sometimes cities, municipalities have a vendor that does the monitoring for them for short-term rentals.

739
01:08:25,383 --> 01:08:29,085
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is an administrative fee associated with that.

740
01:08:29,245 --> 01:08:45,333
[SPEAKER_06]: So it would only make sense to implement that if what we collect in the end exceeds the administrative fee rather than having our short-term rental guests just paying a third-party vendor and the city doesn't get anything out of it.

741
01:08:50,999 --> 01:08:59,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if there's an ordinance in place, the city must have some sort of idea of what properties are operating as short-term rental.

742
01:09:00,122 --> 01:09:00,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully.

743
01:09:00,642 --> 01:09:01,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

744
01:09:01,942 --> 01:09:03,603
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a whole new world.

745
01:09:03,623 --> 01:09:05,763
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

746
01:09:05,863 --> 01:09:06,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

747
01:09:06,443 --> 01:09:07,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Great idea.

748
01:09:09,144 --> 01:09:15,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we want information about that and more information about that ordinance or about this kind of direction?

749
01:09:15,646 --> 01:09:17,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Short-term rental?

750
01:09:17,926 --> 01:09:18,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

751
01:09:20,392 --> 01:09:21,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

752
01:09:21,452 --> 01:09:22,513
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be right back.

753
01:09:22,593 --> 01:09:23,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

754
01:09:23,713 --> 01:09:29,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe Councilor Callahan brought this up to have a rental registry.

755
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:30,716
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've been discussing that.

756
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:38,499
[SPEAKER_08]: And at our office, our intern is also researching on a rental registry at this point.

757
01:09:39,799 --> 01:09:41,160
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a work in progress.

758
01:09:42,941 --> 01:09:46,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

759
01:09:46,442 --> 01:09:48,243
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did contact

760
01:09:50,474 --> 01:10:01,321
[SPEAKER_08]: a third party that hosts a rental registry application in other communities like Worcester, and they're planning to have one in Chelsea or Everett.

761
01:10:02,382 --> 01:10:08,325
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would cost the city $25,000 annually to maintain the platform.

762
01:10:09,366 --> 01:10:10,086
Yeah.

763
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:15,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'm curious to know what information is gathered, if anything, about the short-term rentals.

764
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:18,572
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't need a ton more info, because it sounds like we're going

765
01:10:19,226 --> 01:10:20,609
[SPEAKER_03]: look at that ordinance and figure out.

766
01:10:20,629 --> 01:10:24,155
[SPEAKER_06]: For the short-term renter rental monitoring, they actually monitor

767
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:42,010
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the platforms that people use to rent out apartments or places to stay.

768
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:50,439
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the third party vendor is making sure that everybody who is advertising is registered.

769
01:10:51,299 --> 01:11:01,748
[SPEAKER_06]: and that they're paying the fees that are required for registration and that they meet the requirements that they don't exceed whatever their allowance is.

770
01:11:01,768 --> 01:11:05,951
[SPEAKER_06]: So they do all of that monitoring, which is very different from rental registry.

771
01:11:10,405 --> 01:11:10,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Question 5.

772
01:11:11,745 --> 01:11:15,526
[SPEAKER_08]: The statute does not explicitly allow for fundraising expenses.

773
01:11:15,686 --> 01:11:23,548
[SPEAKER_08]: It does allow for purchasing or retaining real estate or personal property, including investments that yield a high rate of income.

774
01:11:24,069 --> 01:11:26,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Essentially, spend money to make money.

775
01:11:26,769 --> 01:11:33,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps that idea or others in the statute would allow for use in resources to explore funding options for the trust.

776
01:11:35,283 --> 01:11:53,361
[SPEAKER_06]: You had mentioned another thing earlier of the possibility, or maybe it was you who mentioned it, the possibility of providing services for a fee that would generate revenue for the trust, but we'd have to be able to actually provide those services like the.

777
01:11:56,018 --> 01:12:01,400
[SPEAKER_06]: income certification and monitoring resale, the lotteries.

778
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:10,523
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we're already doing that, you know, we could just take on more for a fee, but we'd have to actually have the capacity to do that.

779
01:12:11,423 --> 01:12:20,426
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's also something that one of our nonprofit partners could do to generate revenue and might give them an incentive to do more work here in Medford.

780
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:33,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently, I'm monitoring the rental approvals for affordable housing, and that's part of the regulatory agreement, so I don't think we could charge a fee to do that.

781
01:12:35,049 --> 01:12:36,450
[SPEAKER_07]: But are you doing the lottery?

782
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:38,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're not doing the lottery.

783
01:12:38,031 --> 01:12:39,012
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not doing the lottery.

784
01:12:39,092 --> 01:12:39,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

785
01:12:40,013 --> 01:12:40,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

786
01:12:42,535 --> 01:12:52,323
[SPEAKER_08]: But I wonder if the trust is considered as a municipal employee, would that allow them to actually conduct the lottery, because that has to be

787
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:59,494
[SPEAKER_08]: organization that's impartial.

788
01:13:00,454 --> 01:13:07,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the city of summerville does lotteries for affordable housing for the inclusionary, for the inclusionary properties.

789
01:13:11,185 --> 01:13:14,067
[SPEAKER_07]: or if we had 40 B properties.

790
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:20,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, those will go from a private law, a lottery agent.

791
01:13:20,511 --> 01:13:20,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

792
01:13:20,872 --> 01:13:26,676
[SPEAKER_06]: So we could be the lottery agent or maybe one of our nonprofits could be, or I don't know, maybe, maybe not.

793
01:13:26,696 --> 01:13:27,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

794
01:13:27,196 --> 01:13:30,418
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot of work.

795
01:13:30,578 --> 01:13:32,520
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of work.

796
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:37,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially the city of San Juan just went from

797
01:13:38,172 --> 01:13:48,147
[SPEAKER_07]: the little, the bingo wheel, no, I'm not kidding you, to actually digitize it, which makes it still easier, but it's still a lot of work.

798
01:13:48,749 --> 01:13:50,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we just have our housing stuff.

799
01:13:55,354 --> 01:14:01,559
[SPEAKER_06]: We always have to keep in mind our limitations, which are very significant.

800
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,181
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's the compensation.

801
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:09,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe subcontract out to the third party or through us.

802
01:14:09,965 --> 01:14:11,566
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the that's the idea.

803
01:14:11,586 --> 01:14:16,510
[SPEAKER_05]: If we designate ourselves and we have a deal with someone else, we can at least have

804
01:14:17,457 --> 01:14:20,559
[SPEAKER_05]: part of it, but it is also a lot of work.

805
01:14:20,879 --> 01:14:25,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's about how many the lotteries are happening in a year.

806
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:27,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, putting on an RIP.

807
01:14:29,463 --> 01:14:31,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

808
01:14:31,184 --> 01:14:32,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question.

809
01:14:32,585 --> 01:14:41,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any agreements with Tufts University to get any sort of financial benefit from them?

810
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:42,390
[SPEAKER_06]: A pilot?

811
01:14:43,694 --> 01:14:46,235
[SPEAKER_06]: pilot agreement payment in lieu of taxes.

812
01:14:46,255 --> 01:14:47,216
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.

813
01:14:48,076 --> 01:14:49,217
[SPEAKER_02]: We already have an agreement.

814
01:14:49,397 --> 01:14:53,759
[SPEAKER_02]: They pay $450,000 plus $250,000 for the Cummings property.

815
01:14:53,779 --> 01:14:55,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

816
01:14:55,880 --> 01:15:01,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And then where does that money go into general fund that goes into the general fund?

817
01:15:01,443 --> 01:15:01,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

818
01:15:03,284 --> 01:15:05,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Could it be negotiated that some

819
01:15:06,505 --> 01:15:13,472
[SPEAKER_06]: amount be added or changed, like redirected to go to the Affordable Housing Trust?

820
01:15:19,095 --> 01:15:33,138
[SPEAKER_02]: They just went up to 450 maybe two or three years ago, and the 250 payment is new that was attached to when the Cummings property got their certificate of occupancy.

821
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:44,201
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are fairly new, but if we do any additional negotiation, or I could extend it and ask to Tufts, I'm not sure they'll bite, but I could try.

822
01:15:44,221 --> 01:15:47,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't there new development for student dorms?

823
01:15:48,082 --> 01:15:54,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming up, something we can negotiate for a 1 Boston, right?

824
01:15:54,288 --> 01:15:59,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, they have a very large proposal coming before the city.

825
01:16:00,855 --> 01:16:02,496
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that would be a pretty good time.

826
01:16:03,257 --> 01:16:05,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, especially.

827
01:16:06,953 --> 01:16:23,914
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's any if there's any like room for negotiation in that proposal, you know, they're offering something for for the affordable housing trust might might be helpful to come to an agreement.

828
01:16:27,175 --> 01:16:29,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a good question.

829
01:16:29,236 --> 01:16:38,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask, do, are these uses or kind of actions that we're talking about currently covered in our declaration of trust or would we have to like add language to it?

830
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:40,961
[SPEAKER_05]: The actions that we're talking about?

831
01:16:40,981 --> 01:16:47,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we talking about actions or are we talking about funding sources?

832
01:16:47,723 --> 01:16:49,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Funding sources, yeah.

833
01:16:50,793 --> 01:16:58,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Which could not not yeah, the lottery was probably one that might be decided.

834
01:16:58,237 --> 01:17:03,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I think something linkage and stuff and that's that's.

835
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:08,902
[SPEAKER_05]: This last one, yeah, no, I think I think most of that is just.

836
01:17:09,622 --> 01:17:18,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Or passively accepting funds, and it may seem concluding us or not that actively added, but OK, yeah.

837
01:17:22,825 --> 01:17:30,433
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine it's going to be an ongoing conversation about what are opportunities to generate more revenue for the trust.

838
01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:42,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Those opportunities might not be available to us today, but might come in the future.

839
01:17:43,531 --> 01:17:57,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that it's a conversation that should be had similar to what you're saying, Roberta, just constantly because there are new ways of getting and having the thought process, keeping our eyes and ears open for research.

840
01:17:58,583 --> 01:17:58,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

841
01:18:04,358 --> 01:18:07,100
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize for stepping out of the room.

842
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:08,781
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a phone call.

843
01:18:08,861 --> 01:18:13,625
[SPEAKER_07]: We just got a 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 or something for us to keep in mind.

844
01:18:13,645 --> 01:18:14,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

845
01:18:20,053 --> 01:18:24,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to add to that under finances, we do have to set up a bank account.

846
01:18:25,935 --> 01:18:27,416
[SPEAKER_08]: I spoke with the city's treasurer.

847
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:31,958
[SPEAKER_08]: They already have a bank account under which they bring trust at the line item.

848
01:18:32,558 --> 01:18:36,080
[SPEAKER_08]: So for us to have a line item, we need to have funds.

849
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:41,642
[SPEAKER_08]: So once the funds are in there, then I can inform the city's treasurer to deposit it.

850
01:18:44,123 --> 01:18:44,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

851
01:18:46,191 --> 01:18:51,174
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we are on item number six, invitations to discuss housing resources.

852
01:18:51,894 --> 01:19:08,725
[SPEAKER_07]: So wondering if the trust may consider inviting individuals and groups that manage federal state funds to support housing, CDBG and home funds, nonprofit organizations that provide housing related services, ABCD and housing families.

853
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:14,951
[SPEAKER_07]: advocacy groups made for housing and mission driven developers and so on.

854
01:19:14,971 --> 01:19:27,023
[SPEAKER_07]: So do we want to invite anybody in, tell us about, tell us about themselves, we can share how new we are and how excited we are to be able to work with them as we get them.

855
01:19:29,564 --> 01:19:33,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we want to talk about a little bit about that?

856
01:19:35,567 --> 01:19:47,033
[SPEAKER_08]: I spoke with our CDBG manager and they'd be interested to provide some updates on what they're doing and they'd be happy to attend the meeting in November.

857
01:19:47,093 --> 01:19:48,454
[SPEAKER_08]: That's our next meeting, yes.

858
01:19:49,442 --> 01:19:58,684
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can also provide some updates on NSC's plans and what the funding sources are and what's available.

859
01:20:00,064 --> 01:20:02,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I should remember what this means.

860
01:20:03,185 --> 01:20:07,565
[SPEAKER_08]: NSC can use... North Suburban Consortium.

861
01:20:07,885 --> 01:20:10,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Eight communities that have formed a consortium.

862
01:20:11,426 --> 01:20:13,126
[SPEAKER_06]: That's our home consortium.

863
01:20:13,146 --> 01:20:14,527
[SPEAKER_08]: That's our home consortium.

864
01:20:14,647 --> 01:20:15,367
[SPEAKER_08]: And Malden...

865
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:18,151
[SPEAKER_08]: manages the consortium.

866
01:20:18,231 --> 01:20:18,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

867
01:20:18,671 --> 01:20:21,853
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm the NSC representative from Medford.

868
01:20:22,053 --> 01:20:22,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

869
01:20:22,493 --> 01:20:24,154
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what was CWG?

870
01:20:25,115 --> 01:20:25,675
[SPEAKER_08]: CDBG.

871
01:20:25,715 --> 01:20:26,215
[SPEAKER_08]: CDBG.

872
01:20:26,456 --> 01:20:28,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry for the acronyms.

873
01:20:28,597 --> 01:20:30,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Community Development Block Grant.

874
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:32,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

875
01:20:33,419 --> 01:20:37,722
[SPEAKER_07]: So CDBG is a funding that we received from the federal government.

876
01:20:38,823 --> 01:20:42,745
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's celebrating 50 years actually in October.

877
01:20:42,905 --> 01:20:43,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

878
01:20:46,692 --> 01:20:54,595
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, that would be very helpful to just get the kind of the general picture of what our resources are.

879
01:20:55,955 --> 01:21:12,741
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, we can have at least CDBG and HOMA in our next meeting and then moving forward if the trust would like to invite more groups and entities that support affordable housing or housing services.

880
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:13,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

881
01:21:14,406 --> 01:21:24,959
[SPEAKER_06]: We will have the stakeholder meetings, which it was our, it was our thinking when we had this, the sub committee.

882
01:21:25,583 --> 01:21:34,845
[SPEAKER_06]: that the whole committee might be too many people to be in the room at once with a group of stakeholders.

883
01:21:35,325 --> 01:21:44,308
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were thinking that the three of us would gather that information and then give all of you detailed notes from the conversations that we have with them.

884
01:21:45,128 --> 01:21:49,509
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would cover a lot of the types of stakeholders that you mentioned.

885
01:21:49,829 --> 01:21:52,050
[SPEAKER_06]: But if there's anyone that is like,

886
01:21:53,870 --> 01:22:05,221
[SPEAKER_06]: stands out as somebody who would, it would be helpful to have like some background context for the whole group should identify who those would be.

887
01:22:05,241 --> 01:22:07,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that sounds good.

888
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:14,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I think from our last meeting, one of the other ideas that came from the consultant was

889
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:20,239
[SPEAKER_05]: getting just like the basic real estate developer, you know, playbook.

890
01:22:20,559 --> 01:22:20,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

891
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:25,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Like how they determine how they determine which property.

892
01:22:25,263 --> 01:22:34,889
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I could, I could put some thought on maybe submit a list because I think, I think some of the people we've already mentioned are pretty good at that as well.

893
01:22:35,029 --> 01:22:35,570
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um,

894
01:22:37,068 --> 01:22:45,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I think also looking at some of the sizes of the lots that we're talking about, we're talking about probably smaller scale than some of the people that we're inviting.

895
01:22:45,153 --> 01:22:55,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we should have a mix, but I also think it might be better to talk to, I mean, some of these people are basically going to be, you know, small homeowner, you know, developer.

896
01:22:55,860 --> 01:23:01,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think some of the groups that we're talking about really, that's not almost big enough scale for them, honestly.

897
01:23:01,925 --> 01:23:01,965
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

898
01:23:03,737 --> 01:23:18,504
[SPEAKER_05]: If we wanted to maybe talk about getting someone who could come in and just give a presentation on what they do and what they look at and how they build the stack of capital, that might be a little bit different than the big stakeholder.

899
01:23:18,584 --> 01:23:20,525
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what we're interested in meeting.

900
01:23:22,066 --> 01:23:26,968
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a little bit outside the box, but I don't know if we have anybody in Medford who's doing this kind of thing.

901
01:23:27,088 --> 01:23:29,369
[SPEAKER_06]: But a community that I used to work in

902
01:23:31,409 --> 01:23:46,063
[SPEAKER_06]: further out in the suburbs, they had local developers who would come and take an old house and rehab it and convert it to, say, four to six apartments, four to eight apartments.

903
01:23:46,843 --> 01:23:48,885
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they'd add on to the back of it.

904
01:23:49,225 --> 01:23:51,528
[SPEAKER_06]: The front would be historic preservation.

905
01:23:51,728 --> 01:23:56,272
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it was infill development.

906
01:23:58,108 --> 01:24:09,617
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and it would be, it was, they did that using 40 B. so it's just a model of development that might help with infill.

907
01:24:10,317 --> 01:24:10,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like that.

908
01:24:12,767 --> 01:24:19,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Thinking Main Street, there was, I remember driving by this one house that was on the back.

909
01:24:19,711 --> 01:24:21,252
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a beautiful white house.

910
01:24:21,312 --> 01:24:27,476
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked like a single family, but it was demoed and it is now multi-unit.

911
01:24:27,496 --> 01:24:32,559
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe that for-profit person, I imagine it was for-profit.

912
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:37,184
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of on the lines of what you're talking about.

913
01:24:37,384 --> 01:24:53,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, because that was what they're affordable housing trusted was to invite and basically like look at who was building in the community already right and invite them to use the 40 B process to do infill development and historic preservation and build affordable units.

914
01:24:55,622 --> 01:24:56,503
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great combination.

915
01:24:57,933 --> 01:25:01,274
[SPEAKER_05]: on some of my sustainability measures in there.

916
01:25:01,754 --> 01:25:09,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'll make that my question number one, or idea number one of three.

917
01:25:09,496 --> 01:25:11,256
[SPEAKER_03]: One is having someone come.

918
01:25:11,276 --> 01:25:17,018
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to learn more about building sustainability measures and what they can actually do.

919
01:25:17,058 --> 01:25:18,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to learn more about that.

920
01:25:18,598 --> 01:25:26,080
[SPEAKER_03]: So somewhere down the agenda, I don't know who to recommend, but I feel like I could certainly learn more about that.

921
01:25:28,153 --> 01:25:31,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I want, and this is just in the terms of knowledge coming and sharing with us.

922
01:25:32,716 --> 01:25:40,562
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm also curious where the city's at with accessory dwelling units, which were just approved by right on the state level.

923
01:25:40,682 --> 01:25:50,429
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is something in the mix that I'm sure there are people with some knowledge on or some thinking happening around, but that's kind of base it in coming this way.

924
01:25:50,529 --> 01:25:52,571
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is another topic I'd put out there.

925
01:25:52,591 --> 01:25:55,633
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm just curious, kind of the level

926
01:25:56,700 --> 01:26:17,292
[SPEAKER_03]: detail, so I think some of this will come out in the stakeholder conversations, the action plan, but for the agencies that currently get CPA funding to provide services to Medford residents, like what the numbers look like, what the demand, what the need, and of course, I'm sure that funding doesn't cover all the needed stuff, but kind of getting a sense of those numbers and kind of their thoughts.

927
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:25,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, the stakeholder will get that, but if that then turns into a bigger conversation that we want to learn more from them about as a group, we'll put that on the walks too.

928
01:26:26,963 --> 01:26:28,705
[SPEAKER_06]: That would actually be great.

929
01:26:28,765 --> 01:26:52,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that would be a stakeholder to target bringing to either a CPC or a trust meeting to talk about, like maybe when we have the presentation for the CPC by ABCD or Housing Families.

930
01:26:52,225 --> 01:26:53,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember if they're both.

931
01:26:55,087 --> 01:26:57,870
[SPEAKER_06]: At least Housing Families is coming in for more funding.

932
01:26:57,910 --> 01:26:59,531
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember if ABCD is.

933
01:27:00,932 --> 01:27:12,001
[SPEAKER_06]: That we could ask them to provide more background on how long it's taken them to use up the funding that their previous round of funding and who received it.

934
01:27:12,682 --> 01:27:14,884
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the uptake like?

935
01:27:15,371 --> 01:27:35,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

936
01:27:45,507 --> 01:27:48,948
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not, I like the idea of coming into the Trust as well.

937
01:27:49,208 --> 01:27:50,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, very true.

938
01:27:51,509 --> 01:27:55,650
[SPEAKER_07]: You can always invite them if they say no.

939
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:59,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they'll go wherever they're going to get money as a result of going.

940
01:28:00,271 --> 01:28:07,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we'll really know how much they want to come, because we don't have money.

941
01:28:07,712 --> 01:28:08,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Be a good introduction.

942
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:13,953
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, thank you guys.

943
01:28:14,273 --> 01:28:21,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody have anything else to offer on the invitation for discussion?

944
01:28:21,655 --> 01:28:23,396
[SPEAKER_07]: People coming in, Madam President?

945
01:28:23,936 --> 01:28:27,897
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I upgraded you.

946
01:28:28,578 --> 01:28:38,221
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so if that's everything we've got, I'd like to, is there a motion to adjourn the meeting?

947
01:28:40,208 --> 01:28:40,628
[SPEAKER_07]: So moved.

948
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:42,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

949
01:28:42,689 --> 01:28:44,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you everyone.

950
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:49,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

951
01:28:50,331 --> 01:28:51,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you everyone.

952
01:28:51,691 --> 01:28:52,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

953
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:53,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
