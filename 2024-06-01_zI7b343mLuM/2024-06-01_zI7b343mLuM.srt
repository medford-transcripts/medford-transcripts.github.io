[SPEAKER_05]: May 15th, 2024.

3
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:05,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_05]: 7 present, 0 absent.

5
00:00:21,714 --> 00:00:22,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Meeting is called to order.

6
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:25,396
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee of the Whole at 6 p.m.

7
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:30,900
[SPEAKER_05]: in the City Council Chamber, 2nd Floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George B. Hassett Drive, Medford MA and via Zoom.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,844
[SPEAKER_05]: The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the Fiscal 2025 Budget as part of our annual budget process.

9
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:37,926
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Preliminary Budget Meeting No. 6.

10
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:42,630
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have the following departments present.

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:50,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Bonds and Interest, Debt Service, Elections, Electrical, Facilities, Fire, Information Technology, Law, Parking, and Public Works.

12
00:00:51,158 --> 00:00:58,986
[SPEAKER_05]: At the request of Councillors, we will be taking the Fire Department first, and then the Parking Department, and then the DPW, and then we will go in alphabetical order.

13
00:01:00,047 --> 00:01:02,950
[SPEAKER_05]: So I apologize to the Law Department.

14
00:01:05,663 --> 00:01:07,884
[SPEAKER_05]: With that, we'll start with the fire department.

15
00:01:07,944 --> 00:01:10,466
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Fire Chief Evans with us.

16
00:01:12,227 --> 00:01:19,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically how we've been doing this is I'm going to read the budget and the difference between the prior year.

17
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:21,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go through the change sheet on the second page.

18
00:01:21,653 --> 00:01:25,435
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's anything that I missed or that you want to state, feel free to do so.

19
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:31,458
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'd love to hear your narrative about what the department has been doing in fiscal 24 and what the plans are for fiscal 25.

20
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:38,666
[SPEAKER_05]: And after that, we'll go to questions from counselors and then questions from the public or comments from the public if there are any.

21
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:40,267
[SPEAKER_05]: So does that sound good?

22
00:01:41,529 --> 00:01:41,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

23
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:45,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's your first rodeo up here, so welcome.

24
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:46,975
[SPEAKER_05]: We're happy to have you.

25
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:49,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford Fire Department fiscal 24 budget was $14,536,023.

26
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiscal 25 proposed budget $15,126,017.29.

27
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:52,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiscal 24 budget was for 123 positions.

28
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiscal 24 budget was for 123 positions.

29
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:54,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiscal 25 budget is also for 123 positions.

30
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:14,472
[SPEAKER_05]: The increase is about 4%.

31
00:02:15,753 --> 00:02:29,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of the change is in fixed cost growth, where we have, or the increase, I should say, new fire contract increases, step increases in promotions, and increase in the hazard duty pay.

32
00:02:31,088 --> 00:02:36,473
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks like there are some decreases in a number of line items as well, offsetting

33
00:02:36,913 --> 00:02:42,516
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but the increase is mainly made up of fixed costs, as we have heard for every single department so far.

34
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:49,859
[SPEAKER_05]: So far, we have only heard two non-fixed cost increases, totaling about $60,000 in a $200 million budget.

35
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,739
[SPEAKER_05]: With that, I'll turn it over to you.

36
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,241
[SPEAKER_05]: If I missed anything, and we'd love to hear what your department's been up to and your plans for the next fiscal year.

37
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:03,622
[SPEAKER_19]: Right there?

38
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:04,342
[SPEAKER_19]: There you go.

39
00:03:04,362 --> 00:03:04,763
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, sure.

40
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:10,565
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we get the increases due to the contracts settled.

41
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:25,552
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course, we're aware of the financial constraints on the city to tighten up our belts on other items here, so we have reduced some other items there.

42
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,234
[SPEAKER_19]: But as far as last year goes,

43
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,721
[SPEAKER_19]: just want to hear what was going on in the fire department for the last year.

44
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:38,721
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, of course, we've been very busy.

45
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:44,062
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had several large incident fires.

46
00:03:45,043 --> 00:03:48,843
[SPEAKER_19]: There's all obviously been some changes in the fire department here.

47
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:52,484
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had five people retire in the past year.

48
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:56,925
[SPEAKER_19]: Right now we have five

49
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:01,796
[SPEAKER_19]: New High is scheduled to go to the Academy in July.

50
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:08,278
[SPEAKER_19]: So eventually they'll kind of make up for those people that retired in the past year.

51
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:24,866
[SPEAKER_19]: But basically that's gonna be our primary concern going forward here is that right now there's 106, including myself right now, actually,

52
00:04:25,953 --> 00:04:28,815
[SPEAKER_19]: here working in the stations.

53
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:34,698
[SPEAKER_19]: There are three people that are actually out on injury right now, so that reduces that more.

54
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:54,431
[SPEAKER_19]: So really, we wanna aim for trying to get more bodies in the stations working on the trucks because right now, the overtime has been significant just because

55
00:04:55,731 --> 00:05:07,736
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had every time there's anybody out sick or on vacation, our minimum manning right now, we have 23 person minimum manning to be working on a shift.

56
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:21,721
[SPEAKER_19]: And we have four groups right now where there's roughly 24 people per group, A, B, C, D group.

57
00:05:22,282 --> 00:05:24,563
[SPEAKER_19]: So with 23 minimum manning,

58
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:26,958
[SPEAKER_19]: Summertime is coming up.

59
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:32,940
[SPEAKER_19]: Typically, there are five vacation slots in the summertime weeks going on.

60
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:44,963
[SPEAKER_19]: So every time somebody is on vacation now, just because of the low amount of manpower that we have there in the groups, that does lead to overtime costs.

61
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:47,844
[SPEAKER_19]: And right now, there has been a

62
00:05:48,894 --> 00:05:58,541
[SPEAKER_19]: a large increase in projects going on around the city at like Tufts at 121 Riverside with like welding details and things like that.

63
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:00,243
[SPEAKER_19]: There have been a significant

64
00:06:01,476 --> 00:06:04,098
[SPEAKER_19]: there's been a significant increase in detail work also.

65
00:06:04,818 --> 00:06:15,506
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's kind of factoring into also, you know, grabbing away time that people are spending at either doing details for that covering those things or overtime shifts at the station.

66
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:25,873
[SPEAKER_19]: So really our ultimate goal wishlist is to get more people hired, which is turns into a long process.

67
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:30,356
[SPEAKER_19]: The five that we have going to the academy was probably

68
00:06:33,182 --> 00:06:36,004
[SPEAKER_19]: Probably like an 11 month process just to get them there.

69
00:06:36,544 --> 00:06:55,235
[SPEAKER_19]: So hopefully we can work on getting that process started soon to start replacing more people that we do have one person that's going to have to mandatory retire in January.

70
00:06:57,356 --> 00:07:00,058
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, February, but there are also

71
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:11,637
[SPEAKER_19]: five people that will have, there are five people that will have the time and age that they could just retire whenever they want.

72
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:17,040
[SPEAKER_19]: They could just tomorrow show up in my office and say, yeah, I think I'm gonna be going now.

73
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,964
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's five more right there that could potentially go away.

74
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:31,429
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's why I'm hoping that we can just start the hiring process soon to start getting more people into the stations here.

75
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:48,718
[SPEAKER_19]: to work on covering these overtime cost stoppings, slowing that down, and giving firefighters some time to catch up and come up for air because they've been putting in a lot of time in the stations, extra time.

76
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:55,636
[SPEAKER_19]: There are also grants that we're hoping to go for.

77
00:07:55,756 --> 00:07:59,318
[SPEAKER_19]: We'd like to come up with some more grants this year.

78
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:08,584
[SPEAKER_19]: Lieutenant Danielle Masolino, she's been working very hard on looking for any grants that we can get.

79
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:16,649
[SPEAKER_19]: There's actually a grant for hiring firefighters.

80
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:21,653
[SPEAKER_19]: It's called the SAFER grant, which she did attempt to apply for.

81
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:33,233
[SPEAKER_19]: And we won't hear from that, the results of that probably until either July, August, September, around there maybe.

82
00:08:36,094 --> 00:08:49,318
[SPEAKER_19]: She did attempt to put in for 11 firefighters, which is over $3 million worth of covering over three years.

83
00:08:53,737 --> 00:08:59,261
[SPEAKER_19]: if you actually want to learn any more about that SAFER grant, she could speak on that.

84
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:17,154
[SPEAKER_19]: She's actually here that she could tell you more about that SAFER grant and actually like what we would... Kind of like the numbers that are in accordance with NFPA, the codes and things that tell you

85
00:09:18,413 --> 00:09:32,138
[SPEAKER_19]: how many people you should be having respond to a house fire, the amount of people that should be showing up to a house fire, or the number of trucks that should be showing up on a response to an incident.

86
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:41,855
[SPEAKER_19]: in the levels of people staffed by your department, the SAFER grant kind of factors that into it.

87
00:09:42,035 --> 00:09:57,923
[SPEAKER_19]: Like if it's seeing if your city is striving to try to hit those NFPA standards, they'll kind of like, it kind of works in your favor that they're looking for the departments that are trying to make that commitment.

88
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:03,186
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm hoping that going forward in the future sometime soon, maybe.

89
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:16,531
[SPEAKER_19]: We can try to increase budgeted positions to work towards that, improve our standing to receive grants like that.

90
00:10:19,312 --> 00:10:28,514
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, Lieutenant Masolino actually did in the past year, get us a couple of nice grants.

91
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:29,314
[SPEAKER_19]: She did get us

92
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:46,650
[SPEAKER_19]: She got us a brand new cascade bottle system for refilling our breathing tanks, the tanks that we wear going into fires there.

93
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:49,892
[SPEAKER_19]: She got a grant to cover the expense of that.

94
00:10:51,573 --> 00:11:00,880
[SPEAKER_19]: She also got a grant for us to receive 10 thermal imaging cameras that will be going on the trucks and replacing older thermal images that we used to have.

95
00:11:02,841 --> 00:11:10,326
[SPEAKER_19]: So she's been working hard on finding money out there for us, and she's gonna continue doing that.

96
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:22,935
[SPEAKER_19]: Hopefully, I'm hoping that she's able to, she's gonna attempt to work on grabbing a possible grant that could help more community interaction.

97
00:11:25,016 --> 00:11:30,680
[SPEAKER_19]: That's called, that's a Cummings grant that they give out to,

98
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,523
[SPEAKER_19]: municipalities only that have Cummings commercial properties in it.

99
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,965
[SPEAKER_19]: So Medfit's eligible for that.

100
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:47,290
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe that's like a $100,000 grant, I believe, over three years.

101
00:11:52,354 --> 00:11:53,655
[SPEAKER_19]: So she's working out on that stuff.

102
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:56,297
[SPEAKER_19]: It's quite an asset.

103
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:10,127
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, the other thing is, obviously, all of our work requires the right equipment to do it.

104
00:12:10,407 --> 00:12:14,891
[SPEAKER_19]: And we do have an aging fleet of trucks right now.

105
00:12:16,172 --> 00:12:19,715
[SPEAKER_19]: That is the other concern of us going forward.

106
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:26,021
[SPEAKER_19]: We ordered two, two new engines in 23.

107
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:26,181
[SPEAKER_19]: But

108
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:38,670
[SPEAKER_19]: The wait time on getting those trucks is at the time that we ordered those, the wait time was probably supposed to be 800 something days.

109
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:44,174
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe each truck was around 970 something thousand dollars at the time.

110
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:52,152
[SPEAKER_19]: They're telling us now that we probably won't see those trucks probably until 26.

111
00:12:52,592 --> 00:13:03,619
[SPEAKER_19]: So, right now we have a couple trucks that are like 24 years old that we're just kind of, we're working hard actually.

112
00:13:05,229 --> 00:13:10,791
[SPEAKER_19]: DPW has been great, Brendan and Mike Wentzel.

113
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:16,053
[SPEAKER_19]: They've been working very hard on maintaining the fleet for us, trying to keep it going.

114
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:26,516
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had to get creative with some repairs and seek out some companies that can help us out with those repairs.

115
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:49,533
[SPEAKER_19]: We're managing to hold it together, try to get us through to 26 to get those replaced, but hopefully going forward, we can come up with a plan of replacing new pumpers in a timely fashion, not letting us get to the point of having 24 year old trucks that are hard to maintain and keep together.

116
00:13:52,290 --> 00:14:00,892
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, personnel is what we want to focus on going forward and try to increase that hopefully.

117
00:14:05,494 --> 00:14:05,934
[SPEAKER_19]: Any questions?

118
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:06,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

119
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:07,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

120
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:08,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go.

121
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,275
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I want to say thank you for your presentation.

122
00:14:13,056 --> 00:14:17,257
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did have Lieutenant Marcellino present a lot about the SAFER grant, about

123
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,437
[SPEAKER_05]: time has gone from even four to six weeks ago.

124
00:14:22,257 --> 00:14:25,558
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did hear about that and really impressed by that work.

125
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:30,960
[SPEAKER_05]: And the trucks as well, you know, Chief Friedman was here talking about the 800 day timeline.

126
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:37,582
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why we did approve the free cash allocation, even though it hasn't been spent yet, just to get in the queue.

127
00:14:37,662 --> 00:14:39,323
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really glad.

128
00:14:39,383 --> 00:14:41,964
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you like to hear any more about that safer grant from Lieutenant Marcelino?

129
00:14:42,744 --> 00:14:48,208
[SPEAKER_05]: We heard more, but if she if she's welcome to share, I just want to go to the counselors with their questions for you first.

130
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:52,952
[SPEAKER_05]: But go to Councilor Lemming, Councilor Collins, Councilor Lozaro.

131
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:54,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone over here?

132
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:56,014
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not yet.

133
00:14:56,174 --> 00:14:56,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

134
00:14:57,235 --> 00:14:59,036
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think Councilor Scott probably has some questions too.

135
00:14:59,377 --> 00:14:59,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lemming.

136
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:06,216
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just related to the free cash and getting the fire trucks.

137
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:09,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Just questions on the logistics of that.

138
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:12,818
[SPEAKER_11]: You said we're probably not going to get those trucks till 2026.

139
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:20,180
[SPEAKER_11]: When would they exactly be paid for?

140
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we give them the money now and then we get the trucks in 2026 or how would that exchange work?

141
00:15:27,222 --> 00:15:31,924
[SPEAKER_19]: So, uh, I, I could, I could get you like the contract and all that stuff.

142
00:15:31,984 --> 00:15:35,945
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you want, if you want me to get all that information to you, I can show you all that stuff.

143
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:53,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I didn't bring the entire contract with me, but, uh, the, just to the question that I'm getting at is if we don't get the fire truck, uh, within the fist, the fiscal year that it's ordered, would that, could we just end up paying for that in a later fiscal year at a free cash or,

144
00:15:53,992 --> 00:15:55,735
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already been budgeted for.

145
00:15:55,835 --> 00:16:00,521
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a free cash appropriation approved by the prior council, so it's not in this budget.

146
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:09,013
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just wondering when that money would actually go to the company.

147
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:13,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not 100% sure on that, do you?

148
00:16:13,817 --> 00:16:16,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have to check the specifics of the contract.

149
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:22,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we had to approve, they required for the order us to have approved that the money would be spent.

150
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:27,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure it's an invoicing issue, like we'd get an invoice and pay it.

151
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:31,384
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my understanding, but I'm not sure at what point in the process they send that.

152
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:35,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if they send that after we get it delivered, because I also believe there's some provisions.

153
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:38,987
[SPEAKER_05]: We get it, and then you guys have to test it out and make sure it's working.

154
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:39,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

155
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:46,522
[SPEAKER_05]: but I don't know, maybe the finance department could, procurement could let us know.

156
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:47,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

157
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:55,469
[SPEAKER_05]: We throw that in the committee report just to request procurement, let us know the timing of the free cash payment for the two fire engines.

158
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:03,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other thing, any questions, Councilor Lemming?

159
00:17:04,976 --> 00:17:05,937
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that was it, thank you.

160
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:07,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Collins.

161
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:12,526
[SPEAKER_17]: this is your first budget hearing as chief.

162
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:14,487
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you so much for your service.

163
00:17:14,507 --> 00:17:15,168
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for stepping up.

164
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:15,988
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for being here.

165
00:17:16,388 --> 00:17:17,429
[SPEAKER_17]: We appreciate the overview.

166
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,372
[SPEAKER_17]: Just a couple quick questions for you on my end.

167
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:28,396
[SPEAKER_17]: The 123 positions budgeted for in this proposal, does that include the five firefighters that are heading to the academy in July?

168
00:17:28,636 --> 00:17:28,856
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

169
00:17:30,277 --> 00:17:38,382
[SPEAKER_19]: So the 123 is that's also in one of those positions is actually including our office manager and

170
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:47,464
[SPEAKER_19]: there's another one factored in there for the part-time office professional bid.

171
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:50,188
[SPEAKER_19]: So those aren't firefighters.

172
00:17:50,608 --> 00:17:50,809
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

173
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:52,150
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

174
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:53,732
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for that clarification.

175
00:17:57,197 --> 00:17:58,178
[SPEAKER_17]: So hearing you talk about

176
00:17:59,158 --> 00:18:04,101
[SPEAKER_17]: what's currently in the works and what, you know, the future forecasting for how to make the department stronger over time.

177
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:11,264
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel like you're talking really a lot about pipeline, like what's our pipeline for making sure that we can work more firefighters into the operating budget going forward?

178
00:18:11,844 --> 00:18:19,328
[SPEAKER_17]: What's our pipeline for working more of those infrastructure and fire truck costs into the operating budget going forward with parallel tracks?

179
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:24,911
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, we should come up with a plan for going forward, a timeline for that.

180
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:24,971
[SPEAKER_19]: So,

181
00:18:27,182 --> 00:18:32,145
[SPEAKER_19]: we can examine which trucks are going to have to be up next for replacement, come up with a plan for that.

182
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:41,389
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, get the personnel, we're going to need the personnel and get them get the training done and keep on getting everybody else extra training.

183
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,071
[SPEAKER_19]: They'll be training on the new trucks and

184
00:18:46,128 --> 00:18:47,568
[SPEAKER_19]: That's going to take up some time also.

185
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:59,416
[SPEAKER_19]: Once you receive the trucks in 26, you're putting them on the road and getting people qualified on them, going over them, learning the ins and outs of the new trucks, and that'll take a little time too.

186
00:18:59,516 --> 00:19:00,997
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's not immediate.

187
00:19:03,012 --> 00:19:06,836
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not quite immediate that you get them and boom, they're off and running.

188
00:19:07,136 --> 00:19:08,518
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, certainly that makes a lot of sense.

189
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:10,320
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think it's important to know.

190
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,441
[SPEAKER_19]: Everything takes a little time.

191
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:11,661
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

192
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:12,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

193
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:13,463
[SPEAKER_17]: There's like a lag time to all of this.

194
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:19,309
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lag time between appropriating for increasing hires and increasing recruitment and that actually coming to fruition.

195
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:24,615
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lag time between finally, you know, 800 days later receiving that truck and then being able to put it into use.

196
00:19:26,778 --> 00:19:39,024
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, in the future, you know, I think this council shares the priority of wanting to be able to move more additional positions into the operating budget over time when our fiscal picture isn't quite so austere.

197
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:44,627
[SPEAKER_17]: On the truck side, that seems to me like something that really straddles operating budget and capital plan.

198
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:55,212
[SPEAKER_17]: Has that been a conversation so far of kind of ramping up, you know, kind of this being an ongoing investment, working that into the city's capital improvement plans that we can be purchasing and repairing trucks

199
00:19:55,672 --> 00:20:00,035
[SPEAKER_19]: we're still going to have to work on the conversation about that.

200
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:10,243
[SPEAKER_19]: Because right now we just have the two that are in the pipeline right now that we've talked about so far.

201
00:20:10,403 --> 00:20:13,805
[SPEAKER_19]: So going forward, we'll come up with a plan for that.

202
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:15,787
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

203
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:17,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

204
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:18,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a quick follow up on that.

205
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:23,252
[SPEAKER_05]: After the two 24-year-old vehicles, what's the next oldest?

206
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:52,890
[SPEAKER_13]: 19 years okay, and then 16 years okay

207
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:05,612
[SPEAKER_19]: And we have a couple trucks that are 10 years old and a couple trucks that are six years old.

208
00:21:07,573 --> 00:21:10,735
[SPEAKER_05]: And what generally would be the recommendation of how old the truck should be?

209
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,158
[SPEAKER_05]: When would we start calling it an old truck?

210
00:21:14,678 --> 00:21:15,439
[SPEAKER_19]: Probably 10 years.

211
00:21:16,219 --> 00:21:21,483
[SPEAKER_19]: The amount of runs that Medfit is doing and kind of beating them up.

212
00:21:22,103 --> 00:21:28,568
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, that's kind of like the time that we should be starting to think about turning it over.

213
00:21:28,668 --> 00:21:28,828
[SPEAKER_19]: Got it.

214
00:21:31,294 --> 00:21:31,794
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Zara.

215
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:40,116
[SPEAKER_04]: This is similar to the question that Councilor or Council Vice President Collins asked, but there's an asterisk on the bottom.

216
00:21:41,057 --> 00:21:42,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I didn't say thank you for coming.

217
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:45,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for coming.

218
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:53,520
[SPEAKER_04]: To reiterate, there's an asterisk on the bottom under the personnel services summary that says eight firefighters are anticipated to start in January.

219
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,281
[SPEAKER_04]: How is that?

220
00:21:57,641 --> 00:21:58,781
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no change between the 2024

221
00:22:01,072 --> 00:22:05,379
[SPEAKER_04]: budgeted firefighters and the 2025 budget firefighters.

222
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Are eight people retiring and eight people are starting?

223
00:22:09,966 --> 00:22:10,987
[SPEAKER_04]: How does that move around?

224
00:22:11,087 --> 00:22:15,915
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I believe that asterisk is regarding hopefully the

225
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:19,471
[SPEAKER_19]: Starting a process on getting them hired.

226
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:33,223
[SPEAKER_19]: So we so that will be then factored into So there may be so that's probably anticipating like the long process of starting Doing background checks and then all the other things that come along.

227
00:22:33,283 --> 00:22:35,545
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll take a little time process of like how I said

228
00:22:37,354 --> 00:22:44,359
[SPEAKER_19]: they started the process back in August 23 to start hiring the new guys.

229
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:50,343
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was a long process of getting them all squared away before they can actually get their seat in the academy.

230
00:22:51,024 --> 00:22:52,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, before they even start the academy.

231
00:22:52,324 --> 00:22:52,605
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

232
00:22:53,185 --> 00:22:54,326
[SPEAKER_04]: How long are they in the academy?

233
00:22:54,646 --> 00:22:59,690
[SPEAKER_05]: The current batch of five, it was five started in August 23, and they're going to the academy this July.

234
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:05,654
[SPEAKER_19]: So they didn't, that was just the starting the process of ask calling for the civil service list.

235
00:23:06,883 --> 00:23:17,972
[SPEAKER_19]: selecting the name, taking like, I think they took 20 names off the civil service list, asked them to show up for, you know, say to just come show up and see who's interested.

236
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:20,815
[SPEAKER_19]: I think 18 actually appeared.

237
00:23:21,495 --> 00:23:30,282
[SPEAKER_19]: And then they began the process of how they hired a company to do background investigations on them.

238
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:31,944
[SPEAKER_19]: And then eventually,

239
00:23:33,393 --> 00:23:41,278
[SPEAKER_19]: once they got down to the five, finally, after interviews and things like that, psych exams, physical ability tests, and things like that.

240
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:49,222
[SPEAKER_19]: It ends up being a long process, and then you gotta hope that the academy is gonna have spots for them.

241
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:52,284
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's the other end of it.

242
00:23:52,684 --> 00:23:58,808
[SPEAKER_19]: Once you get them through that, the process on our end, you gotta call the academy and see if they have seats available to take them.

243
00:23:58,968 --> 00:24:00,549
[SPEAKER_19]: So, yeah.

244
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:02,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one more question, if that's okay.

245
00:24:03,953 --> 00:24:10,035
[SPEAKER_04]: What, in your view, would be a fully staffed fire department for Medford?

246
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:20,160
[SPEAKER_19]: Over the years, 106 is certainly the lowest that we've been at.

247
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:22,001
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the lowest that I've ever seen it.

248
00:24:23,302 --> 00:24:28,705
[SPEAKER_19]: But, I mean, probably 2013, we were at 124.

249
00:24:34,758 --> 00:24:38,820
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's like the highest that we've been in the last decade or so.

250
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:49,125
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's just kind of like you get retirements and you can't keep up with the pace of hiring more people to replace the retirements.

251
00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:59,250
[SPEAKER_19]: The department's obviously been aging out over the years and we just haven't kept up with replacing.

252
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,931
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is like a goal, this is a goal amount of staff.

253
00:25:03,312 --> 00:25:03,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

254
00:25:06,442 --> 00:25:07,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

255
00:25:07,342 --> 00:25:10,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further questions for the Fire Department?

256
00:25:12,024 --> 00:25:13,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Scarpelli?

257
00:25:16,946 --> 00:25:18,826
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good for now, Council President.

258
00:25:18,846 --> 00:25:19,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

259
00:25:20,027 --> 00:25:20,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good.

260
00:25:20,487 --> 00:25:20,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

261
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:23,188
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

262
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:27,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, I just had one quick question.

263
00:25:27,729 --> 00:25:29,350
[SPEAKER_05]: The 23 per group minimum manning, is that

264
00:25:30,634 --> 00:25:32,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that coming from the NFPA?

265
00:25:32,456 --> 00:25:36,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a contractual requirement?

266
00:25:36,858 --> 00:25:39,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it based on an NFPA suggestion?

267
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:47,465
[SPEAKER_19]: That's just what they've had in the contract for I'm not sure how many years now.

268
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:50,887
[SPEAKER_19]: Five, maybe five years or so.

269
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:53,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

270
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:54,349
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

271
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:55,210
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my question.

272
00:25:57,211 --> 00:25:58,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further questions from members of the council?

273
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:01,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Sanders.

274
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily a question.

275
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:09,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there may be more questions when the final budget comes out, but I wanted to thank you for your service.

276
00:26:09,976 --> 00:26:11,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's not been easy.

277
00:26:11,918 --> 00:26:16,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's not been an easy time to be our fire chief.

278
00:26:17,162 --> 00:26:18,183
[SPEAKER_06]: We really appreciate it.

279
00:26:19,303 --> 00:26:22,246
[SPEAKER_06]: All we hear is praise for you from everyone.

280
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:25,068
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that speaks a lot to your leadership.

281
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:26,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know who's saying such things.

282
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure we'll hear more from our firefighters.

283
00:26:35,763 --> 00:26:42,649
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to make sure that we are getting those grants, that we are spending the money we need to get that extra benefit.

284
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:47,773
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not only healthy for the fire department, it's healthy for our city financially as well.

285
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:52,356
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be top of mind for me going into this budget season.

286
00:26:52,516 --> 00:26:54,378
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate your presentation.

287
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:55,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

288
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:56,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

289
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any comments by members of the public?

290
00:27:01,818 --> 00:27:09,334
[SPEAKER_19]: just want to say I would just want to thank again the DPW IT Rich Lane he's been great and

291
00:27:10,472 --> 00:27:13,873
[SPEAKER_19]: facilities, Paul's been fantastic.

292
00:27:14,113 --> 00:27:23,635
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, over the years, there's one of the issues with buildings in Medford is clearly that we build buildings and we've let them kind of fall apart.

293
00:27:24,135 --> 00:27:30,477
[SPEAKER_19]: And Paul has been on it like, Paul's been on it great, but if there's a problem, Paul jumps on it and gets it fixed.

294
00:27:31,357 --> 00:27:31,837
[SPEAKER_19]: We used to have,

295
00:27:33,057 --> 00:27:33,838
[SPEAKER_19]: You might've seen them.

296
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:36,299
[SPEAKER_19]: We had the windows in fire prevention.

297
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:41,641
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, since 2018, they used to, every time it rained, there was like a waterfall coming in through the windows all over the rugs.

298
00:27:41,721 --> 00:27:50,986
[SPEAKER_19]: And Paul found out about it and he got somebody right in there recently and got it all fixed up for, so again, Paul's been doing a great job.

299
00:27:51,106 --> 00:27:52,987
[SPEAKER_19]: So we appreciate that very much.

300
00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:55,648
[SPEAKER_05]: We love DPW and facilities as well.

301
00:27:56,148 --> 00:27:56,728
[SPEAKER_05]: IT's okay.

302
00:28:04,221 --> 00:28:05,141
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, thank you so much.

303
00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:06,302
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, and building department.

304
00:28:06,322 --> 00:28:07,562
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't forget building department.

305
00:28:07,582 --> 00:28:10,744
[SPEAKER_19]: They show up whenever we have a late night emergency or something like that.

306
00:28:10,824 --> 00:28:12,064
[SPEAKER_19]: And we absolutely need that.

307
00:28:12,204 --> 00:28:15,706
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to keep the scene safe and they show up and take care of those issues for us.

308
00:28:15,726 --> 00:28:16,706
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank them also.

309
00:28:17,186 --> 00:28:17,546
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

310
00:28:18,187 --> 00:28:18,887
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

311
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:19,387
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

312
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:26,130
[SPEAKER_19]: And of course, my fantastic firefighters.

313
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:26,510
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

314
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:26,950
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

315
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:27,731
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, firefighters.

316
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:30,032
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a laundry list of these podiums.

317
00:28:30,072 --> 00:28:30,472
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it.

318
00:28:31,311 --> 00:28:32,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Buckley, name and address, record, please.

319
00:28:33,072 --> 00:28:36,035
[SPEAKER_12]: Walter Buckley, 340 Salem Street, Method.

320
00:28:36,055 --> 00:28:39,197
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to have a few comments.

321
00:28:39,497 --> 00:28:43,880
[SPEAKER_12]: The first one is our staffing right now, you guys were talking about, we're budgeted for 123.

322
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,383
[SPEAKER_12]: One of them's the clerk, so it's 122.

323
00:28:47,543 --> 00:28:49,064
[SPEAKER_12]: One of them's the chief, so it's 121.

324
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:49,985
[SPEAKER_12]: But we only have 106 members.

325
00:28:53,067 --> 00:29:00,636
[SPEAKER_12]: So as we're talking about the summer that comes around where minimum manning is 23, five guys are on vacation.

326
00:29:01,136 --> 00:29:03,199
[SPEAKER_12]: That means 19 people are coming in.

327
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,984
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a guaranteed four overtimes during the day and four overtimes during the night.

328
00:29:09,105 --> 00:29:10,506
[SPEAKER_12]: pretty much all throughout the summer.

329
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:14,009
[SPEAKER_12]: So I saw that the overtime budget was being cut.

330
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:16,611
[SPEAKER_12]: That might be an issue going forward.

331
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:21,234
[SPEAKER_12]: Also on the trucks, we have an aging fleet.

332
00:29:21,314 --> 00:29:23,836
[SPEAKER_12]: We have two trucks that are supposed to be coming in 2026.

333
00:29:23,976 --> 00:29:26,218
[SPEAKER_12]: No plans right now for any more trucks.

334
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:31,022
[SPEAKER_12]: And I saw on the budget that some of the maintenance was also being cut.

335
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:36,246
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it's a good idea to cut truck maintenance when you have an aging fleet and nothing coming.

336
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:39,816
[SPEAKER_12]: in the new year on this budget anyway.

337
00:29:46,207 --> 00:29:48,528
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's all I have.

338
00:29:48,568 --> 00:29:55,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Lieutenant Marcelino is going to talk about the SAFER grant and she'll tell you more about staffing for trucks.

339
00:29:55,872 --> 00:29:58,913
[SPEAKER_12]: According to NFPA standards, we're below that right now.

340
00:29:59,713 --> 00:30:03,395
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe the NFPA standards for us is five per truck.

341
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:04,996
[SPEAKER_12]: We have three per truck.

342
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:08,097
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's also an issue with staffing.

343
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:13,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Our main goal for the union is we need more members because more members work.

344
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:16,686
[SPEAKER_12]: And we don't have to do details every day.

345
00:30:16,806 --> 00:30:17,686
[SPEAKER_12]: Overtime is every day.

346
00:30:17,706 --> 00:30:26,509
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, some guys are working five or six days a week and you're working 24 hour shifts in the overtime and the details, you know, we're getting worn out.

347
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:30,091
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't think it's sustainable to do it with 105 members, to be honest.

348
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Danielle Masolino, 11 Spencer Road.

349
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:43,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I come with all of the nerdy information that some of you are asking.

350
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:46,843
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Councilor Zara, you asked about being fully staffed.

351
00:30:48,664 --> 00:30:52,726
[SPEAKER_03]: There really isn't like a whole number that you would say would be fully staffed.

352
00:30:52,806 --> 00:30:57,028
[SPEAKER_03]: But just to give a perspective of the history of the fire department, back in 1989, we were at our

353
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:06,793
[SPEAKER_03]: we say heaviest, there was 170 firefighters back in 1989, and we did 6,200 runs that year.

354
00:31:07,373 --> 00:31:13,957
[SPEAKER_03]: We're currently staffed at 107, and we did 12,450 runs last year, approximately.

355
00:31:15,037 --> 00:31:20,960
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're doing an infinitely larger number of runs versus how few firefighters we have.

356
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,122
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go into the NFPA standards, which is what governs our

357
00:31:26,863 --> 00:31:28,244
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, safety guidelines.

358
00:31:28,945 --> 00:31:35,872
[SPEAKER_03]: They like President Buckley said about 55 people on each engine and whatnot.

359
00:31:35,932 --> 00:31:37,714
[SPEAKER_03]: They recommend based on

360
00:31:39,585 --> 00:31:41,226
[SPEAKER_03]: low, medium, and high hazards.

361
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:53,549
[SPEAKER_03]: And with our city being the construction that it is and the number of high rises that we have, they actually consider us a moderate hazard instead of the low hazard that we wrote the grant to.

362
00:31:54,190 --> 00:32:03,432
[SPEAKER_03]: So what they would consider appropriate staffing would be five on each engine and six on each ladder, which would actually be a staffing of 37 every day versus the 23 that we staff right now.

363
00:32:08,974 --> 00:32:19,242
[SPEAKER_03]: We, with the grant, we were hoping to shoot for at least four on each piece of apparatus, and we ended up having to cut it down to the 11, which gets under that.

364
00:32:20,844 --> 00:32:37,037
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'd probably have, I think, if we got the grant, and every single person came to work that day, we would be able to staff up to, I think, four on each engine company, or four on four engine companies, and then three on the other additional pieces.

365
00:32:37,697 --> 00:32:38,518
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's better.

366
00:32:39,138 --> 00:32:53,406
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we're talking about safety and Chief Evans spoke about, you know, where we're going in the future, we would like to see those numbers go up so that we have, you know, the more we have working on the fire ground, obviously, the safer it is overall.

367
00:32:55,738 --> 00:33:02,762
[SPEAKER_03]: And the closer we get to those numbers, the more, the closer we're gonna get to being able to get rated.

368
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:08,165
[SPEAKER_03]: We go into ISO rating, or I'm sorry, our staffing level gets classified.

369
00:33:08,525 --> 00:33:16,750
[SPEAKER_03]: And once we're classed, if we're a class one department, that actually reduces the ISO rating for the city, which would in turn reduce the taxes on that.

370
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,591
[SPEAKER_03]: on the citizens and things like that.

371
00:33:18,671 --> 00:33:20,712
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like kind of all works together.

372
00:33:20,812 --> 00:33:23,994
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, you know, it's not just because we like to hang out with more people at work.

373
00:33:24,054 --> 00:33:26,735
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that, you know, the whole thing actually plays into the city.

374
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:30,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think what else I had.

375
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:33,938
[SPEAKER_03]: The grant, I know I spoke about it a lot the last time I was here.

376
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,340
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, that was like $3.9 million, if we get it.

377
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:44,005
[SPEAKER_03]: So that goes, the grant season is, the award season is between September 1st, or August 1st and September 31st.

378
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:46,007
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully, we'll be able to get something.

379
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:52,171
[SPEAKER_03]: And should we get awarded that, those 11 would go towards our staffing numbers, and that would actually bring us up to the 122.

380
00:33:53,712 --> 00:33:58,476
[SPEAKER_03]: So with the additional five that we have going to the Academy, we would be fully staffed with that grant.

381
00:34:01,795 --> 00:34:04,859
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the 11 would be paid for by the federal government, which is a better sell.

382
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,924
[SPEAKER_03]: But anything beyond that, I don't know if anybody else has any questions.

383
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:12,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have one.

384
00:34:13,688 --> 00:34:21,117
[SPEAKER_05]: On the NFPA standards, do they also have like a formula for like the size of a city, number of high rises, like how many engines and ladders you should have?

385
00:34:23,752 --> 00:34:30,574
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think they have it for, I can look into that, but I don't think there's a set formula for that.

386
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:46,737
[SPEAKER_03]: But what they do recommend is number of personnel showing up to a call and the low hazard for a first alarm house fire that are kind of like ours, it would be 17 on the first alarm.

387
00:34:47,778 --> 00:34:49,378
[SPEAKER_03]: We just barely get there.

388
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:51,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, because there's only 23 people.

389
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:56,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, and it goes into the people that are actually staffed for that group.

390
00:34:57,112 --> 00:34:59,913
[SPEAKER_03]: There's other little details with it.

391
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:01,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that 17 firefighters?

392
00:35:01,514 --> 00:35:03,415
[SPEAKER_03]: 17 firefighters on the first alarm.

393
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:10,338
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that only speaks to two-story wood construction on slab.

394
00:35:11,398 --> 00:35:29,012
[SPEAKER_03]: um slab foundation so no basement so no basement and no attic um we go further because we have the attic the basement the blue frame there's all the other details with us so we would be a little bit higher than that yeah um but i can find out exactly what they what they have to say about that if you want thank you

395
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:39,353
[SPEAKER_12]: We've actually gone to the IFF, which is our parent union, and they are conducting a study on the City of Method.

396
00:35:39,894 --> 00:35:47,297
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know how long it's gonna, probably gonna take a couple months anyway, but they're gonna give us all that information that we'll obviously send out forward to you guys.

397
00:35:47,847 --> 00:36:02,415
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes with, like, a really nice formatted presentation that's, like, really easy to work with, and you'd be able to go through it and click and go to the standards and look at that kind of, you know, look at all the details of it on your own.

398
00:36:02,715 --> 00:36:06,077
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd obviously try to present it to all of you if we had time, if you had time.

399
00:36:06,677 --> 00:36:14,462
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, it's going to speak to all of that as far as, like, how many piece apparatus, how many members we should have working.

400
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,782
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the age of our fleet, it talks about everything, which is great.

401
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,464
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're really looking forward to having that all done.

402
00:36:21,244 --> 00:36:22,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you so much.

403
00:36:22,325 --> 00:36:22,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

404
00:36:23,826 --> 00:36:30,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further comment from anyone on the fire department budget in person or on Zoom?

405
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:32,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I miss a question?

406
00:36:33,373 --> 00:36:34,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Lemming, sorry.

407
00:36:35,254 --> 00:36:55,239
[SPEAKER_11]: I just had a question because Chief Buckley mentioned that the maintenance services are being cut and I'm seeing the line item here for motor services going from 75 to 65 and motor repair supplies going from 120 to 100, but it looks like the actuals for the motor services is about 5,000.

408
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, it was about 5000 this year.

409
00:37:01,722 --> 00:37:04,864
[SPEAKER_11]: And the actuals for the motor repair supplies is about 36,000.

410
00:37:04,924 --> 00:37:11,008
[SPEAKER_11]: So is that is that it's kind of like typical utilization of that line item?

411
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:12,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Year to year?

412
00:37:12,469 --> 00:37:13,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this just uniquely?

413
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

414
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:19,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Fellow President, I'm very disappointed that you would demote President Buckley.

415
00:37:19,474 --> 00:37:19,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

416
00:37:20,054 --> 00:37:22,936
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe the real chief didn't speak on that.

417
00:37:30,245 --> 00:37:31,165
[SPEAKER_11]: My apologies.

418
00:37:31,465 --> 00:37:32,306
[SPEAKER_11]: My apologies.

419
00:37:32,386 --> 00:37:34,246
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a slip.

420
00:37:36,146 --> 00:37:36,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

421
00:37:36,827 --> 00:37:39,287
[SPEAKER_05]: We had some solidarity there.

422
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,688
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was recorded too.

423
00:37:43,088 --> 00:37:45,689
[SPEAKER_11]: So, okay.

424
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:47,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, man.

425
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:49,490
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be a long night.

426
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:50,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

427
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:59,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lemming, you were asking about the actual usage for the vehicle maintenance and repair.

428
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

429
00:38:03,123 --> 00:38:07,628
[SPEAKER_11]: I was focusing on the motor services expenses.

430
00:38:07,688 --> 00:38:12,233
[SPEAKER_11]: It says that the actuals so far this year were about $5,000 out of a $75,000 allocation.

431
00:38:12,253 --> 00:38:13,375
[SPEAKER_11]: That is as of December 31.

432
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:25,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, even so, the actuals are typically a little bit over 50%, but that just seems very low given the amount.

433
00:38:26,685 --> 00:38:33,010
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know if this is just a unique year where we haven't had a whole lot of repair problems.

434
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you say that that's typical?

435
00:38:38,553 --> 00:38:45,898
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, with the aging fleet, the aging fleet, that could go up, that could change.

436
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:47,319
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that's just

437
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:50,308
[SPEAKER_19]: a hopeful number.

438
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:55,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any expense that is being paid out of the DPW budget for the repairs of your vehicles?

439
00:38:55,972 --> 00:38:56,132
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

440
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:57,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than the staffing?

441
00:38:58,193 --> 00:38:58,373
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

442
00:38:58,453 --> 00:38:59,214
[SPEAKER_05]: The fleet maintenance?

443
00:38:59,414 --> 00:39:00,115
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

444
00:39:00,455 --> 00:39:05,998
[SPEAKER_19]: We have to still buy lots of tires for trucks and things like that.

445
00:39:06,038 --> 00:39:12,743
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a whole bunch of things that we constantly replace for certain parts of the trucks that get worn out.

446
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,761
[SPEAKER_19]: consistently.

447
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:23,327
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess the nature of the question is do you typically go under your allocated repair budget?

448
00:39:23,347 --> 00:39:26,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there some years where it's higher, some years where it's really low?

449
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:27,990
[SPEAKER_11]: What does that usually look like?

450
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,311
[SPEAKER_19]: It could go higher, sure.

451
00:39:30,571 --> 00:39:36,375
[SPEAKER_19]: Especially right now, we're trying to kind of band-aid some things here and there.

452
00:39:49,005 --> 00:39:54,869
[SPEAKER_19]: So just to save his eye, his vision because he's

453
00:39:59,659 --> 00:40:01,380
[SPEAKER_03]: My printing is very, very small.

454
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:04,222
[SPEAKER_03]: In 23, they budgeted $50,000 for vehicle maintenance and repair.

455
00:40:04,242 --> 00:40:05,423
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually went over, we were at $81,463.

456
00:40:05,463 --> 00:40:07,245
[SPEAKER_03]: And then vehicle supplies was budgeted at $85,000.

457
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:08,265
[SPEAKER_03]: And we went over to, it was $95,343.

458
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:10,747
[SPEAKER_03]: And years past, it looked pretty much the same.

459
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:11,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that fiscal 23?

460
00:40:26,058 --> 00:40:27,939
[SPEAKER_03]: This was this was last year's budget.

461
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:28,619
[SPEAKER_03]: So the fiscal year 24.

462
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:29,579
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was the 23 actual.

463
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:29,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

464
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:29,959
[SPEAKER_03]: And then 22.

465
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:30,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing.

466
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,320
[SPEAKER_03]: 22 budgeted was 50,000.

467
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,300
[SPEAKER_13]: And the actual was 76,259.

468
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:32,720
[SPEAKER_03]: For

469
00:40:41,663 --> 00:40:47,228
[SPEAKER_03]: maintenance and the vehicle supplies was budgeted at $80,000 and we went over at $85,000.

470
00:40:47,548 --> 00:40:52,672
[SPEAKER_03]: The past years were pretty much the same.

471
00:40:53,573 --> 00:40:59,418
[SPEAKER_03]: The only time it was a little bit less was when I think the other mechanic was more dedicated.

472
00:40:59,438 --> 00:41:09,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he was kind of dedicated to our department, so it was a little bit less in the maintenance realm, but the supplies was just as high.

473
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:14,882
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and then our fleet's getting older, so it's just going to get worse from here.

474
00:41:14,902 --> 00:41:15,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

475
00:41:17,323 --> 00:41:17,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

476
00:41:18,344 --> 00:41:18,944
[SPEAKER_05]: The chief of staff.

477
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:24,467
[SPEAKER_14]: I may have some slightly different information.

478
00:41:24,507 --> 00:41:29,830
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure, but for purposes of providing the council the information that was asked.

479
00:41:31,007 --> 00:41:34,848
[SPEAKER_14]: I have motor services, FY23 actual $34,000, 20 actual $54,000, 21 actual $26,000, 22 actual $51,000, 23 actual, I did hear $82,000.

480
00:41:34,908 --> 00:41:36,989
[SPEAKER_14]: There's another line that is motor repair supplies.

481
00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:38,170
[SPEAKER_14]: I have $66,000 out of what is a $120,000 budget.

482
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:59,359
[SPEAKER_14]: $50,000, $50,000, $85,000, $104,000.

483
00:41:56,256 --> 00:41:59,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Today's actuals, presently, are $43,000, roughly, call it $44,000, and $67,000, respectively.

484
00:41:59,379 --> 00:42:08,746
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, just on the question of whether any other budgets like TPW cover, I agree, not the materials, but obviously the labor and the overtime is covered by TPW.

485
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:25,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

486
00:42:26,642 --> 00:42:34,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for our edification and edification of the public in the future, is it possible to include the prior actuals in the ClearGov presentation?

487
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:36,968
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good question.

488
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:41,110
[SPEAKER_14]: I can certainly ask our folks to look into that.

489
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:46,774
[SPEAKER_14]: I know ClearGov, you know, has, I know we have the prior year actuals in ClearGov.

490
00:42:47,175 --> 00:42:50,257
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure how much it can load.

491
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:52,258
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a good question though.

492
00:42:52,298 --> 00:42:52,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool, thank you.

493
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:53,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

494
00:42:54,319 --> 00:43:02,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Just generally speaking, it would be useful, although I realize it could be a lot more effort for first-year counselors to kind of see how

495
00:43:02,745 --> 00:43:06,127
[SPEAKER_11]: these budgets have progressed over the years, just for context.

496
00:43:06,848 --> 00:43:07,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, absolutely.

497
00:43:07,528 --> 00:43:11,210
[SPEAKER_14]: I just actually asked our assistive finance director to send me the information.

498
00:43:11,831 --> 00:43:12,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

499
00:43:12,151 --> 00:43:12,451
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

500
00:43:13,912 --> 00:43:14,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

501
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:18,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have a question for the chief of staff.

502
00:43:19,195 --> 00:43:22,978
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all the budgets that were printed off of the city's website, off of ClearGov.

503
00:43:23,178 --> 00:43:24,859
[SPEAKER_05]: ClearGov had inaccurate information.

504
00:43:24,879 --> 00:43:25,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Inaccurate?

505
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:26,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

506
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so these are not the budgets that we used?

507
00:43:31,971 --> 00:43:36,893
[SPEAKER_05]: The actuals data in ClearGov, we discussed this in the last budget, was not all uploaded correctly.

508
00:43:37,473 --> 00:43:42,015
[SPEAKER_05]: So the budget data, like what was the budget for fiscal 24, the budget amounts were correct.

509
00:43:42,435 --> 00:43:46,957
[SPEAKER_05]: But my understanding is that actuals data was not all accurate that was uploaded.

510
00:43:46,997 --> 00:43:51,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you look at it, there's like a fiscal 21 in there where it says the city spent like $50 million.

511
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:53,039
[SPEAKER_05]: That's obviously not true.

512
00:43:54,622 --> 00:43:55,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I didn't go back.

513
00:43:55,463 --> 00:43:56,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, some of them I did.

514
00:43:56,624 --> 00:44:04,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I went back, I think, until 2020, but the ClearGov ones I would have assumed because we went to that nice new software.

515
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:13,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there was definitely some issues with the information that was uploaded, and we did talk about it last year, and we've already talked about it this budget cycle about making sure that whatever is put up there is accurate.

516
00:44:14,138 --> 00:44:14,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

517
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:15,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

518
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,221
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully that there's a lot of it for many prior years.

519
00:44:18,642 --> 00:44:19,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

520
00:44:19,202 --> 00:44:19,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

521
00:44:23,214 --> 00:44:30,359
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, seeing no hands raised and no one at the podium for the Fire Department, we're going to move to the Parking Department.

522
00:44:30,439 --> 00:44:31,940
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Director Morrison with us.

523
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:39,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Director Morrison, I'm going to quickly read the budget figures and then you can correct any mistakes that I make.

524
00:44:40,186 --> 00:44:41,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you won't make any mistakes.

525
00:44:41,827 --> 00:44:48,231
[SPEAKER_05]: We would love to hear any kind of highlights for this year, things you're planning for next year.

526
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:53,174
[SPEAKER_05]: And then one thing, which I forgot to ask Chief Evans, but he did give it to me anyway.

527
00:44:53,574 --> 00:44:58,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything that you're planning for in the future that wasn't included in this budget?

528
00:44:58,558 --> 00:44:59,518
[SPEAKER_05]: No, and he already got me.

529
00:44:59,558 --> 00:45:00,479
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you want to come back up?

530
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:13,540
[SPEAKER_05]: He got he filled it in its staffing it's the engine so we got there but I didn't ask it formally so if there's stuff that's not in here, but that your department needs and is planning for in future budgets we'd love to hear about that too.

531
00:45:13,941 --> 00:45:14,101
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

532
00:45:14,514 --> 00:45:19,598
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will just quickly say we have the parking department fiscal 24 budgeted 1,015,559, fiscal 25 budget 951,563.80.

533
00:45:19,638 --> 00:45:21,299
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a reduction of 63,995.20 and about a 6% reduction.

534
00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:22,980
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also a reduction in the headcount from 13 to 12.

535
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,961
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like the loss of one clerk position.

536
00:45:42,426 --> 00:46:02,312
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there were some fixed cost increases for the, looks like for non-union 2% contract and minor ordinary increases, but also a significant reduction in professional services of 70,000 related to having the new parking meters.

537
00:46:02,632 --> 00:46:04,993
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, I will turn it over to you, Director Morrison.

538
00:46:05,353 --> 00:46:09,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well the first thing I want to correct is we didn't really lose a position.

539
00:46:11,179 --> 00:46:21,309
[SPEAKER_15]: When we started, because we didn't have enough technology in the transition, we had more staff in the office because we were doing everything with paper and by hand.

540
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:38,213
[SPEAKER_15]: Now that we are operating totally within our new system, as two part-time clerks left, I re-evaluated what we needed, and so we changed that to one part-time clerk with more hours that served what we needed, and it's working out very well.

541
00:46:40,505 --> 00:46:41,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the correction.

542
00:46:41,686 --> 00:46:50,394
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I just want to make it sound like they cut a position because that's not what I actually did that because I want the office to reflect what we need.

543
00:46:51,155 --> 00:46:53,257
[SPEAKER_15]: And we didn't just didn't need that extra staff.

544
00:46:53,537 --> 00:46:53,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

545
00:46:53,817 --> 00:46:54,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

546
00:46:55,458 --> 00:46:59,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, floor is yours highlights of the year and plans for next year.

547
00:46:59,611 --> 00:47:12,183
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so the highlights of the year, obviously, is we've now transitioned a lot of the old stuff out of the system and we're almost totally just our new operating system.

548
00:47:12,203 --> 00:47:13,584
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a couple more things left.

549
00:47:14,005 --> 00:47:20,251
[SPEAKER_15]: For example, when I took over, there were $2 million in tickets, unpaid tickets.

550
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:23,193
[SPEAKER_15]: We have whittled that down to about $8,000 now.

551
00:47:25,115 --> 00:47:26,676
[SPEAKER_15]: and collected a lot of that money.

552
00:47:26,776 --> 00:47:29,258
[SPEAKER_15]: And the last bit of it is straggling.

553
00:47:29,318 --> 00:47:33,341
[SPEAKER_15]: And now as people are trying to get their registry holds released.

554
00:47:33,901 --> 00:47:40,005
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's been exciting to start moving that out and be operating in our own system.

555
00:47:40,165 --> 00:47:41,366
[SPEAKER_05]: You said $2 million down to $8,000.

556
00:47:41,486 --> 00:47:43,588
[SPEAKER_15]: It was like $1,999,000, but basically $2 million.

557
00:47:50,933 --> 00:47:51,893
[SPEAKER_15]: Pretty good, worse.

558
00:47:52,013 --> 00:47:59,315
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's reflected in what you see in our income and how it's high at this time because we are collecting that old money.

559
00:47:59,775 --> 00:48:03,796
[SPEAKER_15]: At some point, I think we'll settle into a little over a million dollars a year.

560
00:48:04,296 --> 00:48:15,199
[SPEAKER_15]: We're obviously covering our budget, which was a request when I was interviewed to make sure that we were paying for ourselves, for lack of a better term, and we are doing that.

561
00:48:15,879 --> 00:48:19,560
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was able to cut the budget as much as I was because

562
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:27,145
[SPEAKER_15]: technology and using that technology has allowed us to save in other costs.

563
00:48:27,685 --> 00:48:34,791
[SPEAKER_15]: So you'll see like GTechness costs went up significantly, but that's only because we're buying more technology from them.

564
00:48:35,391 --> 00:48:40,055
[SPEAKER_15]: But it looks like it went down in that professional services because as we put in the new equipment,

565
00:48:40,795 --> 00:48:44,897
[SPEAKER_15]: and the old equipment comes out, we're not paying that vendor anymore for the processing.

566
00:48:45,277 --> 00:48:54,162
[SPEAKER_15]: So that money starts to disappear, and we'll start to see just the three legs of our own system at some point, and those figures will start to settle as well.

567
00:48:54,602 --> 00:48:57,883
[SPEAKER_15]: But this year, GTechNA, along with GTechNA,

568
00:48:59,244 --> 00:49:01,286
[SPEAKER_15]: We are developing a couple of new things.

569
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:06,289
[SPEAKER_15]: One of them is the GL zone that I'm sure you've all heard about.

570
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:19,518
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is my staff has been involved in getting that permit developed and getting all that information into the system and, and have it ready to go and which we are, and we're ready to start that on July 1.

571
00:49:21,899 --> 00:49:29,322
[SPEAKER_15]: We are proposing, and I'm sure when we come before this body because we've been asked for it, some temporary passes.

572
00:49:30,002 --> 00:49:39,726
[SPEAKER_15]: So for folks who are moving into the city and need something for a moving truck for the day, or someone who has a workman in for more than the two days that the visitors pass.

573
00:49:40,826 --> 00:49:42,307
[SPEAKER_15]: covers that comes with the permit.

574
00:49:42,667 --> 00:49:48,370
[SPEAKER_15]: These two and three day temporary passes will allow those people to park on the street and operate.

575
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:59,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Landlords who can't get permits because they don't live in the city and can't get visitors passes because they don't live in the city can access those temporary passes.

576
00:50:00,295 --> 00:50:00,755
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's

577
00:50:02,376 --> 00:50:15,495
[SPEAKER_15]: Something that most of your surrounding communities offer, and it's been there's been a lot of asking for it and so we've developed that and we were hoping that that's something that the city will adopt Jim Silva who has been just

578
00:50:17,338 --> 00:50:33,211
[SPEAKER_15]: and a measurable resource has been very successful in this year and bringing together parking stakeholders that didn't think they were so like engineering and myself and planning, and the chief we meet on a regular basis.

579
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:36,193
[SPEAKER_15]: to start developing communication streams.

580
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:42,338
[SPEAKER_15]: So like, I know when someone's going to be digging up the road, because they're not calling engineering when someone digs up their road.

581
00:50:42,358 --> 00:50:43,239
[SPEAKER_15]: They're calling parking.

582
00:50:43,759 --> 00:50:46,462
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we have to tell them, we don't know what you're talking about.

583
00:50:46,562 --> 00:50:50,705
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're trying to develop those communications.

584
00:50:50,725 --> 00:50:56,790
[SPEAKER_15]: It is going very well, so that everybody knows what's going on and can answer those questions when they come across our desk.

585
00:50:57,831 --> 00:51:06,816
[SPEAKER_15]: We also have started this year assisting engineering in distributing the no parking signs for different projects, trenching projects and that type of thing.

586
00:51:07,516 --> 00:51:12,539
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we're now charging them for those signs, we weren't before, but we should have been.

587
00:51:12,799 --> 00:51:20,863
[SPEAKER_15]: And so because we're close to Treasury, we've volunteered to take that part on and people can come down with their permit and purchase the signs from parking.

588
00:51:22,234 --> 00:51:36,584
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing that we have also instituted this year is charging for the paid spaces when a vendor, when someone comes in and wants to do work in that area, sometimes they're there for 90 days.

589
00:51:37,164 --> 00:51:46,911
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that the city doesn't lose that income, they rent those spaces from us and then purchase the parking signs as well in order to do the work.

590
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:49,113
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're just trying to have a more organized,

591
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:51,954
[SPEAKER_15]: So we know what's going on in our city.

592
00:51:52,114 --> 00:52:03,057
[SPEAKER_15]: And if someone calls and says, you know, someone's digging up my street and it's not on that list, then we know we can call inspectional services and they go over and shut it down because they shouldn't be doing that.

593
00:52:03,117 --> 00:52:05,818
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm just surprised at how often it happens.

594
00:52:05,858 --> 00:52:12,439
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm happy to see that we're moving towards having more organization around that and for parking to be part of it.

595
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:30,817
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing, which is a big thing for my office, we found out in January that we are being honored by the International Mobility Parking Institute for technology and innovation.

596
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:35,122
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we'll get that award in Columbus, Ohio on June 11th.

597
00:52:36,503 --> 00:52:50,355
[SPEAKER_15]: where I will also be making a presentation about this department, because it's unheard of to have a parking department go from zero to 100 in four months.

598
00:52:50,395 --> 00:52:51,296
[SPEAKER_15]: It just doesn't happen.

599
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:52,757
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an 18-month project.

600
00:52:53,197 --> 00:52:55,859
[SPEAKER_15]: And so people out there are very interested in how we did it.

601
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,381
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a lot of collaborative work.

602
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:09,445
[SPEAKER_15]: not only with people here at City Hall, but with the vendors that we also brought on board, and also being able to utilize nontraditional ways of bringing those people on board.

603
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:27,811
[SPEAKER_15]: RFPs, people tend to use for those, but there are all kinds of lists, SourceWell, MAPC, Omni, things of that nature, where the state has done all the vetting of these folks, and so you can bring them on without having to do the RFP process, which we had to use to move so quickly.

604
00:53:28,611 --> 00:53:32,055
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's exciting, and I'm looking forward to that.

605
00:53:32,915 --> 00:53:34,497
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's a lot of the highlights.

606
00:53:34,637 --> 00:53:42,124
[SPEAKER_15]: Just being up operational, we could be better staffed.

607
00:53:42,484 --> 00:53:48,350
[SPEAKER_15]: If we had five more staff people in the parking control enforcement end, I think we could get more work done.

608
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:53,074
[SPEAKER_15]: That still continues to be a struggle, and we get a lot of calls from residents.

609
00:53:53,755 --> 00:53:55,535
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, wanting to know why we can't do more.

610
00:53:55,776 --> 00:53:58,616
[SPEAKER_15]: We just do what we can do with the resources that we have.

611
00:54:00,517 --> 00:54:01,917
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is some of the highlights.

612
00:54:02,777 --> 00:54:07,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of the things that we're looking forward to, the jail zone starting in July, obviously.

613
00:54:08,899 --> 00:54:10,679
[SPEAKER_15]: The new passes that I talked about.

614
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:17,381
[SPEAKER_15]: We're also looking to restore some of the technology that was in the cars that would allow us to do LPR.

615
00:54:20,822 --> 00:54:23,344
[SPEAKER_15]: like they did before, like Reef was doing before.

616
00:54:24,285 --> 00:54:26,867
[SPEAKER_15]: And that would be helpful for us for two reasons.

617
00:54:27,247 --> 00:54:30,550
[SPEAKER_15]: We're short-staffed, and that technology helps us with staffing.

618
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:40,377
[SPEAKER_15]: But also, it helps with the folks who are working alone in the overnight shift, and it provides them a little bit more security, since they wouldn't have to get out of the car.

619
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:48,484
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's important to me, because it should be at least a minimum of a two-man overnight crew, which we just don't have at the moment.

620
00:54:49,304 --> 00:54:53,527
[SPEAKER_15]: We have someone working 4 to 12 and then we have someone 3 to 11.

621
00:54:55,169 --> 00:54:58,872
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to increase that staffing at night, you know, so that they have support.

622
00:55:02,554 --> 00:55:05,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, congratulations to your department and the incredible work that you've done.

623
00:55:05,977 --> 00:55:06,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

624
00:55:07,018 --> 00:55:09,700
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm glad to see that it's being honored as it should be.

625
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:10,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

626
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:12,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions from members of the council?

627
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:14,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lozaro, Vice President Collins.

628
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:21,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't expecting the parking department to be so inspiring, but thank you.

629
00:55:22,579 --> 00:55:24,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Very happy to hear this information.

630
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:32,582
[SPEAKER_04]: And what an exciting thing that you've really turned things around and paying for your whole own department functionally.

631
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:34,082
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

632
00:55:34,282 --> 00:55:44,504
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there is any kind of concrete way that we can help support the hiring of more enforcement officers in the future,

633
00:55:45,631 --> 00:55:50,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I can say that I can see evidence of the need for that in the community.

634
00:55:50,854 --> 00:55:59,057
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do understand that being something that is a critical need, but congratulations on all of your hard work.

635
00:55:59,778 --> 00:56:00,398
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very evident.

636
00:56:00,478 --> 00:56:01,819
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a very hard working crew.

637
00:56:01,879 --> 00:56:09,082
[SPEAKER_15]: I remind people that although I put it together, it is my staff that makes it happen.

638
00:56:10,259 --> 00:56:12,080
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not writing one ticket, so.

639
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:21,083
[SPEAKER_15]: I do appreciate them, because what we've done has even surprised me, because this is not what I promised at first.

640
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:24,645
[SPEAKER_15]: I said, you know, a couple of years, maybe, we'll be able to support ourselves.

641
00:56:25,065 --> 00:56:34,709
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm very happy that we're doing it, but a lot of that is collecting that old money, which was very, I know when I first started, there was all these rumors about how it was $10 million and $5 million.

642
00:56:34,789 --> 00:56:39,091
[SPEAKER_15]: It was actually a little under $2 million, and we've just about collected it all.

643
00:56:40,837 --> 00:56:41,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Great work.

644
00:56:41,638 --> 00:56:41,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

645
00:56:42,338 --> 00:56:42,878
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.

646
00:56:42,898 --> 00:56:43,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

647
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:44,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Collins.

648
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,141
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

649
00:56:46,461 --> 00:56:50,163
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for being here and I want to also offer my congratulations.

650
00:56:50,443 --> 00:56:50,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

651
00:56:50,703 --> 00:56:54,726
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the product of a lot of hard work and I think it really shouldn't go unsaid.

652
00:56:54,786 --> 00:57:02,331
[SPEAKER_17]: It is pretty remarkable to go from having this like very, very normal municipal service be completely

653
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,624
[SPEAKER_17]: out of house completely contracted to bring that in house.

654
00:57:05,664 --> 00:57:07,367
[SPEAKER_17]: That's something I was always excited about.

655
00:57:07,387 --> 00:57:11,214
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's really quite amazing to see that become self-sufficient so quickly.

656
00:57:11,936 --> 00:57:13,017
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you for your leadership.

657
00:57:13,078 --> 00:57:13,398
[SPEAKER_17]: I know it.

658
00:57:14,318 --> 00:57:17,219
[SPEAKER_17]: I know like any major transition, it's been a rocky road at times.

659
00:57:17,479 --> 00:57:19,160
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it is.

660
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,901
[SPEAKER_17]: Just really one quick question.

661
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:27,182
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you spoke already to transitioning from some software and technological vendors to others.

662
00:57:27,242 --> 00:57:34,405
[SPEAKER_17]: I noticed the biggest line item change was the decrease of 70,000 under professional services, financial.

663
00:57:34,505 --> 00:57:35,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that what you're talking about?

664
00:57:35,565 --> 00:57:36,566
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I'm talking about.

665
00:57:36,626 --> 00:57:41,489
[SPEAKER_15]: So basically, I try not to throw the names out there because, you know, I try to be fair to them.

666
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:52,297
[SPEAKER_15]: But basically, as we are replacing the flow birds, which are very old and have been very expensive to maintain, and we're putting in the new equipment, that's allowed us to have that drop.

667
00:57:52,337 --> 00:57:54,799
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not paying them the processing fees for that.

668
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:57,461
[SPEAKER_15]: When I started, we were paying them about $67,000 a year.

669
00:58:00,003 --> 00:58:04,888
[SPEAKER_15]: And this year we will pay them $8,000 because we've started to work their machines out of the system.

670
00:58:05,749 --> 00:58:16,122
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a program called Meters for Trees that we're looking at to take the last 12 out of the system because of where they are over on Boston Ave, kind of a long walk.

671
00:58:16,722 --> 00:58:19,305
[SPEAKER_15]: We would put signs up for just pay by phone there.

672
00:58:20,026 --> 00:58:27,891
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the for every meter we take out the pay by phone corporation would donate a tree to the city to be planted somewhere.

673
00:58:28,391 --> 00:58:31,893
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're looking that's one of the things we're looking at for the next fiscal year.

674
00:58:32,413 --> 00:58:33,574
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's a great idea.

675
00:58:34,054 --> 00:58:38,056
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry that the tree warden is probably hearing about this now I haven't had a chance to meet with her.

676
00:58:41,337 --> 00:58:50,543
[SPEAKER_15]: But it is my plan to reach out to the tree warden and bring her into this, because obviously she would play the role in deciding where all of that went if we go with that program.

677
00:58:51,003 --> 00:58:57,527
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it would be the best way to remove the last vinyl of the old infrastructure out of the system.

678
00:58:57,607 --> 00:59:03,671
[SPEAKER_15]: Because if not, if we have to wait to replace it, you're talking about $60,000, $70,000 to replace it.

679
00:59:04,191 --> 00:59:06,953
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's where it is and where it is.

680
00:59:06,993 --> 00:59:08,814
[SPEAKER_15]: We've had some issues with vandalism.

681
00:59:08,854 --> 00:59:10,135
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know how much you've heard.

682
00:59:10,715 --> 00:59:17,021
[SPEAKER_15]: But it would cut down on that too, because it's just not an area that at night that's very populated.

683
00:59:17,381 --> 00:59:20,183
[SPEAKER_15]: So it just lends itself to that kind of mischief.

684
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:26,008
[SPEAKER_15]: But if the machines aren't there, and the parking is still there, because the signs will be there, you just have to use pay by phone.

685
00:59:26,028 --> 00:59:28,771
[SPEAKER_15]: So you wouldn't have the cash option and those options.

686
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:32,674
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think that we're talking about 12 machines, not the whole city.

687
00:59:33,175 --> 00:59:34,856
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it would work in that area.

688
00:59:35,296 --> 00:59:38,139
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I'm hoping that we all get a chance to move that forward.

689
00:59:38,459 --> 00:59:40,180
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I think that's a really exciting idea.

690
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:52,350
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think the parking department, you know, how expensive it was to use an outside contractor, you know, that we're keeping that in house now that the city is, you know, these are city employees now and kind of, in a lot of ways, it's talking about return on investment.

691
00:59:52,410 --> 01:00:00,916
[SPEAKER_17]: And wow, when you talk about getting like 12 trees donated, I think one of the many shocking things you learn behind the rail, how expensive it is to plant a single tree is one of them.

692
01:00:01,036 --> 01:00:04,099
[SPEAKER_17]: So I really, I'm really excited by that creative idea.

693
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:04,419
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

694
01:00:04,759 --> 01:00:06,400
[SPEAKER_15]: I am also with pay by phone.

695
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:17,287
[SPEAKER_15]: We are looking at, the businesses have been looking at some parking that they could pay for, like some of the doctor's offices that are here in Medford Square, limited parking.

696
01:00:17,867 --> 01:00:19,388
[SPEAKER_15]: I've had a lot of feedback from them.

697
01:00:20,088 --> 01:00:25,312
[SPEAKER_15]: Pay by phone has a system where they could pay for their patient's parking before they even show up.

698
01:00:25,972 --> 01:00:28,694
[SPEAKER_15]: And all they would have to do is find a space somewhere in the zone.

699
01:00:29,534 --> 01:00:30,876
[SPEAKER_15]: and go in for their appointment.

700
01:00:31,436 --> 01:00:38,263
[SPEAKER_15]: And so just streamline the process, whether they charge them for the parking or not is up to them, but we can make that service available for them.

701
01:00:38,964 --> 01:00:39,865
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a great idea.

702
01:00:40,005 --> 01:00:43,569
[SPEAKER_17]: And one more thing, I just didn't quite catch, you were talking about

703
01:00:44,383 --> 01:00:50,069
[SPEAKER_17]: We've only got a new type of permit for vendors that are parking temporarily while they're doing work.

704
01:00:50,109 --> 01:00:51,010
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that like for contractors?

705
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:53,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I don't call those permits because they're not permanent.

706
01:00:54,193 --> 01:00:55,134
[SPEAKER_15]: They would be passes.

707
01:00:55,514 --> 01:01:06,205
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're talking about a one day moving van pass for people who are moving in and out of the city, and a two and three day parking pass for either someone who's coming in and doing repair work,

708
01:01:06,886 --> 01:01:09,647
[SPEAKER_15]: or a landlord that's coming in and working on their building.

709
01:01:10,028 --> 01:01:19,652
[SPEAKER_15]: We've had a lot of landlords that are just in this position where if there's no one actually renting their place at the moment, they don't have access to a visitor's pass.

710
01:01:20,273 --> 01:01:24,295
[SPEAKER_15]: And due to our requirements for residency, they are not eligible for one.

711
01:01:24,875 --> 01:01:28,737
[SPEAKER_15]: So this would allow them to come in and temporarily do that.

712
01:01:29,157 --> 01:01:30,898
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's not something long term, which is not.

713
01:01:31,298 --> 01:01:34,979
[SPEAKER_15]: We're trying to make sure that the residents have room to park.

714
01:01:35,539 --> 01:01:44,442
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what the G Zone is all about as well, giving people options off just their street to park, because no streets are even here.

715
01:01:45,062 --> 01:01:47,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Some streets are smaller, some streets are longer.

716
01:01:47,842 --> 01:01:57,385
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're hoping that that experiment will bear good fruit and we can collect good data from it and allow us to maybe spread it around.

717
01:01:58,114 --> 01:01:58,294
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

718
01:01:58,614 --> 01:01:58,895
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

719
01:01:58,935 --> 01:01:59,455
[SPEAKER_17]: And that makes sense.

720
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:00,556
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate that explanation.

721
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:07,262
[SPEAKER_17]: And last thing I will say as a longtime resident of the GLX zone and a person who lives on a very short street, really excited for July.

722
01:02:09,124 --> 01:02:09,824
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we're trying.

723
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:12,945
[SPEAKER_15]: And like I said, I can't take all the credit for that.

724
01:02:13,685 --> 01:02:17,806
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm happy to assist Jim in these projects and moving them forward.

725
01:02:17,826 --> 01:02:28,209
[SPEAKER_15]: And like I said, having someone who isn't the director of any of those departments when we get together, be that head person, makes it easier because nobody is in charge.

726
01:02:28,269 --> 01:02:28,629
[SPEAKER_15]: He is.

727
01:02:29,309 --> 01:02:35,631
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I think it's allowed us to move things a little bit smoother and quicker, having that kind of

728
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:39,432
[SPEAKER_15]: voice here to bring kind of rope us all in.

729
01:02:40,132 --> 01:02:41,313
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's been in the works for a long time.

730
01:02:42,534 --> 01:02:43,955
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm happy to see it happen.

731
01:02:44,455 --> 01:02:45,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

732
01:02:45,396 --> 01:02:48,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking for the tree enthusiasts, all I can say is no Bradford pears.

733
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:51,100
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to leave that to you.

734
01:02:52,501 --> 01:02:53,742
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not a tree expert.

735
01:02:54,182 --> 01:02:55,303
[SPEAKER_15]: I would never even try.

736
01:02:55,343 --> 01:02:57,064
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about all I got.

737
01:02:57,424 --> 01:02:58,445
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Councilor Scarpelli.

738
01:03:00,307 --> 01:03:01,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

739
01:03:01,628 --> 01:03:03,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for all your hard work.

740
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:17,189
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the impact because of, I think that, oh boy, when you first started, we were calling the office on a daily basis and now we don't have many calls and that says a lot about

741
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:24,135
[SPEAKER_07]: department that, you know, unfortunately, people look at like, it's evil.

742
01:03:24,155 --> 01:03:26,697
[SPEAKER_07]: So but we know, we get it.

743
01:03:26,737 --> 01:03:27,818
[SPEAKER_15]: We're never gonna be loved.

744
01:03:27,878 --> 01:03:28,298
[SPEAKER_15]: We get it.

745
01:03:28,578 --> 01:03:37,866
[SPEAKER_15]: We're just trying to do the best we can for the residents because we are invested in and doing our part to make things better for the city.

746
01:03:38,325 --> 01:03:39,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I appreciate it.

747
01:03:39,166 --> 01:03:47,851
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that the only question I had is I remember that we had talked in the past that for your comfort, I know that your office was a little.

748
01:03:49,452 --> 01:03:52,894
[SPEAKER_07]: How can I say it was underwhelming?

749
01:03:53,635 --> 01:03:55,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Have we done any anything to support you?

750
01:03:56,237 --> 01:03:58,778
[SPEAKER_07]: And in your comfort level in your department?

751
01:03:58,858 --> 01:04:00,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that have we done anything to help with that?

752
01:04:02,361 --> 01:04:02,421
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh,

753
01:04:03,767 --> 01:04:11,870
[SPEAKER_15]: I know there was there were a lot of people looking at it, but I think that the determination was that it wasn't cost effective to do anything.

754
01:04:12,471 --> 01:04:13,871
[SPEAKER_15]: At least that's my understanding.

755
01:04:14,151 --> 01:04:17,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe the chief of staff or Paul Reggie can give you a better answer.

756
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:24,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, I think whatever, whatever we're doing, there's got to be there's got to be a solution where we can find

757
01:04:26,218 --> 01:04:33,804
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, hopefully find a more suitable location for you, especially as we're growing and as you're taking on pretty important pieces.

758
01:04:33,844 --> 01:04:44,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know that it doesn't sound like a lot, but just doing the passes for projects or for moving, that's going to be a very busy office.

759
01:04:44,473 --> 01:04:47,235
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, and if you look at neighboring communities,

760
01:04:48,649 --> 01:04:50,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Boy, they're standalone buildings.

761
01:04:51,131 --> 01:04:54,272
[SPEAKER_07]: And from what I recall, yours is possibly a cubicle.

762
01:04:54,352 --> 01:05:08,661
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would hope that we a little bit more proactive and finding you a better location or another space in the building where you have that space that you and your staff deserve.

763
01:05:08,701 --> 01:05:10,202
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to share.

764
01:05:10,482 --> 01:05:16,904
[SPEAKER_15]: The upside of our space, sir, is that when people come in and pay, at least the treasury office is close.

765
01:05:17,064 --> 01:05:18,425
[SPEAKER_15]: It's right across the hall.

766
01:05:18,925 --> 01:05:22,206
[SPEAKER_15]: And so they don't have to wander far when they're coming in to pay.

767
01:05:22,286 --> 01:05:25,127
[SPEAKER_15]: So six of one, half dozen of the other.

768
01:05:26,894 --> 01:05:27,554
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

769
01:05:28,555 --> 01:05:29,095
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

770
01:05:29,816 --> 01:05:30,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

771
01:05:31,877 --> 01:05:32,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some questions.

772
01:05:32,557 --> 01:05:40,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if the chief of staff or facilities director want to talk about the office space at all in the parking department and we've been able to make.

773
01:05:54,184 --> 01:05:55,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, thank you.

774
01:05:55,945 --> 01:05:56,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Never easy to say.

775
01:05:57,085 --> 01:06:00,706
[SPEAKER_14]: It's challenging to take on something that I agree is needed.

776
01:06:01,246 --> 01:06:04,788
[SPEAKER_14]: In this case, there was, I don't want to speak to the technical matter of it.

777
01:06:04,868 --> 01:06:11,250
[SPEAKER_14]: I defer to our facilities director, Paul Riggi, but it's one that, you know, has some load bearing walls.

778
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:15,931
[SPEAKER_14]: It has issues with, you know, the ceiling spaced above.

779
01:06:16,992 --> 01:06:20,413
[SPEAKER_14]: And when we went out for quotes or bids, my recollection is it was a $50,000 cost.

780
01:06:22,554 --> 01:06:28,677
[SPEAKER_14]: So I didn't, never wanted to say to our parking director that we couldn't do that, but that is kind of, it became cost prohibitive.

781
01:06:29,138 --> 01:06:30,779
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's what I can offer.

782
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:36,461
[SPEAKER_14]: If there are any questions that I can answer, I'm happy to, or I can certainly point in the direction of our facilities director.

783
01:06:36,942 --> 01:06:37,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Understood.

784
01:06:37,322 --> 01:06:40,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope in the future we can find a way to, to make some changes.

785
01:06:42,304 --> 01:06:44,726
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, you say 50,000.

786
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:46,507
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I say 50,000?

787
01:06:46,727 --> 01:06:47,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

788
01:06:47,067 --> 01:06:47,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

789
01:06:47,287 --> 01:06:47,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

790
01:06:48,468 --> 01:06:49,268
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my recollection.

791
01:06:49,288 --> 01:06:49,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

792
01:06:49,548 --> 01:06:49,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

793
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:52,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

794
01:06:53,551 --> 01:07:00,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Facetiously, maybe we should maybe make an office move from city solicitor's office and the traffic and parking.

795
01:07:00,334 --> 01:07:01,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that might work.

796
01:07:07,718 --> 01:07:11,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad we're in such a lighthearted mood this evening, but that landed the way that it did.

797
01:07:14,001 --> 01:07:15,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff for the answer.

798
01:07:18,925 --> 01:07:23,588
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had a couple questions you've answered most of them without me having to ask them, which I always appreciate.

799
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:40,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to confirm the suggestion of additional staffing the department was sometime in the future it would be beneficial to have as many as five additional parking and five additional parking folks would allow us to have at least be minimally staffed.

800
01:07:41,861 --> 01:07:46,964
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it would also allow us to respond to requests.

801
01:07:47,444 --> 01:07:52,927
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very frustrating when people call us and say, you know, someone's parked on my street or someone's blocking.

802
01:07:53,227 --> 01:08:01,511
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to refer them to traffic because some days at that time I might just have one person there and there's only so much one person can do.

803
01:08:02,191 --> 01:08:05,493
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it'd be nice to be able to give a better answer than that.

804
01:08:06,013 --> 01:08:06,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

805
01:08:07,655 --> 01:08:12,299
[SPEAKER_05]: And the LPR, the license plate readers, I just didn't catch it.

806
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:15,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Are those going in on the parking department vehicles or the police?

807
01:08:15,302 --> 01:08:28,995
[SPEAKER_15]: We have two vehicles that we inherited that have it on there, but it was so broken when we got it that when I had our vendor look at it, he said it's just too cost prohibitive to fix it.

808
01:08:29,495 --> 01:08:39,623
[SPEAKER_15]: So I waited until I could budget for it to reintroduce it into the system, and they'll be here in early June to fit two of the vehicles that we have with that technology.

809
01:08:39,943 --> 01:08:41,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

810
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:44,747
[SPEAKER_05]: And one other thing, and it's come up a little bit, but I just wanted to speak to it directly.

811
01:08:45,447 --> 01:08:54,631
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, ever since we've made this transition, one of the concerns has been the safety of the staff in your department, both folks out in the street and quite frankly, folks at the window.

812
01:08:54,651 --> 01:08:57,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Has that situation improved at all?

813
01:08:57,272 --> 01:08:58,173
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my goodness, yes.

814
01:08:59,033 --> 01:08:59,614
[SPEAKER_15]: It really has.

815
01:09:00,434 --> 01:09:09,798
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we're never gonna make 100% of the city happy, but I gotta say that probably 95% of the people are very gracious at that window.

816
01:09:09,858 --> 01:09:10,879
[SPEAKER_15]: You're always gonna have.

817
01:09:11,519 --> 01:09:18,723
[SPEAKER_15]: that one or two people who just don't want to pay their ticket or feel like they were ticketed unfairly.

818
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:23,826
[SPEAKER_15]: We do have an appeals process and we encourage people to appeal their ticket if they feel like that's happened.

819
01:09:24,407 --> 01:09:33,272
[SPEAKER_15]: But we also have a very good system and I'm not saying that we don't make mistakes, everyone does, but we make very few because there's no pressure from me

820
01:09:33,932 --> 01:09:35,113
[SPEAKER_15]: for a quota of tickets.

821
01:09:35,614 --> 01:09:40,057
[SPEAKER_15]: I want the ones they write to be good ones and correct and stand up to an appeal.

822
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:43,780
[SPEAKER_15]: They take a lot of supporting pictures to assist in that.

823
01:09:44,341 --> 01:09:47,123
[SPEAKER_15]: And the parker can see the pictures that we've taken.

824
01:09:47,603 --> 01:09:48,904
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's unusual.

825
01:09:49,165 --> 01:09:52,728
[SPEAKER_15]: Most departments keep those pictures for the appeals process.

826
01:09:53,348 --> 01:10:01,937
[SPEAKER_15]: But when I started here, I realized that we were doing such a culture change that I wanted people to see transparently what the process was.

827
01:10:02,337 --> 01:10:09,985
[SPEAKER_15]: So once we usually go in and show them the pictures, that usually tamps down their anger because we're just showing them.

828
01:10:11,218 --> 01:10:11,758
[SPEAKER_15]: what we did.

829
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:15,679
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that's made it much easier.

830
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:25,862
[SPEAKER_15]: But LPR will be helpful, especially with the new zone, but nothing replaces having eyes on the ground, boots on the ground.

831
01:10:26,362 --> 01:10:27,743
[SPEAKER_15]: You really need that.

832
01:10:28,883 --> 01:10:29,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

833
01:10:29,363 --> 01:10:30,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

834
01:10:30,704 --> 01:10:31,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Scarpelli.

835
01:10:32,763 --> 01:10:33,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

836
01:10:33,364 --> 01:10:33,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize.

837
01:10:34,024 --> 01:10:34,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I should have brought this up.

838
01:10:34,865 --> 01:10:42,069
[SPEAKER_07]: And director reminded me that on the on the appeals process, I know that is it?

839
01:10:42,769 --> 01:10:44,431
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't really had a chance to look through it.

840
01:10:44,471 --> 01:10:48,213
[SPEAKER_07]: And someone just mentioned it this afternoon, and wanted me to ask a question.

841
01:10:48,773 --> 01:10:48,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it?

842
01:10:49,013 --> 01:10:59,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it just people that the talk the talk around Medford again with the appeal process being something to the tune of $250?

843
01:11:01,361 --> 01:11:06,763
[SPEAKER_15]: No, we don't charge for an appeals process, but someone has the right.

844
01:11:06,843 --> 01:11:16,726
[SPEAKER_15]: If they appeal the ticket and they don't like the decision, anyone in Massachusetts that gets a ticket can go to their county courthouse and have a hearing.

845
01:11:16,946 --> 01:11:18,047
[SPEAKER_15]: And they charge the $250.

846
01:11:18,087 --> 01:11:18,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

847
01:11:23,243 --> 01:11:23,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

848
01:11:24,485 --> 01:11:27,489
[SPEAKER_15]: There's just one other thing I wanted to mention if it's okay.

849
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:34,140
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not on my budget because I took it out and put it on capital, but we still need a pickup truck for the meter crew.

850
01:11:35,599 --> 01:11:46,168
[SPEAKER_15]: We had an older truck that we got from DPW that they were getting rid of, but I expended my repair budget taking care of it, so I respectfully gave it back.

851
01:11:46,928 --> 01:11:56,877
[SPEAKER_15]: The police stepped up and gave us a Bronco, which is low mileage, it is great, but when you're taking, you see those kiosks, you need an open back truck to work with those.

852
01:11:57,357 --> 01:12:01,441
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's just something that we still need to get back into the system.

853
01:12:01,801 --> 01:12:02,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

854
01:12:02,301 --> 01:12:02,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

855
01:12:03,042 --> 01:12:03,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

856
01:12:05,344 --> 01:12:07,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further questions from members of the council?

857
01:12:08,687 --> 01:12:12,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, any comments from members of the public in person or on Zoom?

858
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:14,131
[SPEAKER_05]: In person, come to the podium.

859
01:12:14,311 --> 01:12:15,632
[SPEAKER_05]: On Zoom, please raise your hand.

860
01:12:19,615 --> 01:12:20,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, thank you very much.

861
01:12:21,057 --> 01:12:21,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Director Morrison.

862
01:12:22,097 --> 01:12:22,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, everybody.

863
01:12:22,858 --> 01:12:23,739
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate your time.

864
01:12:23,959 --> 01:12:25,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations again for your hard work.

865
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:26,401
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, thank you.

866
01:12:31,021 --> 01:12:33,823
[SPEAKER_05]: DPW, you are next.

867
01:12:35,604 --> 01:12:46,252
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will welcome Commissioner McGivern, Engineer Wartella, and any other of the DPW crew if they're wanting to join us.

868
01:12:47,653 --> 01:12:49,094
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just me and Owen tonight.

869
01:12:50,255 --> 01:12:51,116
[SPEAKER_18]: Mary's on vacation.

870
01:12:51,496 --> 01:12:52,037
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

871
01:12:52,517 --> 01:12:56,720
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you do have very specific questions.

872
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, how are you gonna answer your questions?

873
01:13:01,291 --> 01:13:02,252
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to do our best.

874
01:13:03,832 --> 01:13:08,415
[SPEAKER_18]: But I have the budget book here, so we can dig if we need to.

875
01:13:08,755 --> 01:13:11,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, let's put a motion and email Mary.

876
01:13:12,977 --> 01:13:13,758
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to bother her.

877
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:16,319
[SPEAKER_05]: No, on Monday or whenever she's back.

878
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:22,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we're going to go in alphabetical order through your department starting with cemetery.

879
01:13:24,625 --> 01:13:25,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we'll just do quick.

880
01:13:26,307 --> 01:13:32,254
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll read it through pause and have questions on each department rather than try to have everybody remember all.

881
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:36,196
[SPEAKER_05]: or six of them, because I will forget.

882
01:13:36,836 --> 01:13:43,198
[SPEAKER_05]: So starting with the Cemetery Division of the Department of Public Works, we have fiscal 24 budget, $1,059,320.

883
01:13:43,238 --> 01:13:44,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiscal 25 budget, $1,118,050.11 for a net increase of $58,730.11.

884
01:13:56,768 --> 01:14:00,412
[SPEAKER_05]: The headcount is remaining at nine, nine fiscal 24, nine fiscal 25.

885
01:14:01,233 --> 01:14:04,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And the growth in that is almost entirely salaries.

886
01:14:05,057 --> 01:14:10,863
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all fixed cost growth, no new programs, no new staff, as well as inflation cost increases for supplies.

887
01:14:11,444 --> 01:14:13,746
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that, what's going on with the cemetery division?

888
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:16,011
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, so you are correct.

889
01:14:16,311 --> 01:14:21,073
[SPEAKER_18]: And what I will say, what we have going on at the cemetery is capital-based.

890
01:14:22,174 --> 01:14:24,415
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll just kind of give you a rundown of what we're doing.

891
01:14:25,215 --> 01:14:33,178
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, when I started and, you know, I assessed each division, what's going on, cemeteries needs are capital-based, they're expensive.

892
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:38,841
[SPEAKER_18]: So just to tell you the things I got spun up here, let's see here.

893
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:51,175
[SPEAKER_18]: We have an architect currently doing some design development for both cemetery buildings, the maintenance garage, as well as the caretakers' quarters.

894
01:14:51,575 --> 01:14:57,862
[SPEAKER_18]: Both of those buildings are historic, so we're working with the historic commission to see if we can find some funding for the actual projects.

895
01:14:58,963 --> 01:15:01,345
[SPEAKER_18]: Those buildings have seen a bunch of deferred maintenance.

896
01:15:02,066 --> 01:15:12,934
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think the estimate was total work to bring them back to full preservation condition is about $8 million for both buildings.

897
01:15:13,355 --> 01:15:19,159
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're not going to do all that at one time, but we do have to plan for that because they're historic.

898
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:23,401
[SPEAKER_18]: We're also working on some cemetery expansion projects, two of them.

899
01:15:24,281 --> 01:15:30,342
[SPEAKER_18]: One of them we call the seven acre project, and another one is just moving an operational pile of soil.

900
01:15:30,402 --> 01:15:31,243
[SPEAKER_18]: So we open up a lawn.

901
01:15:32,343 --> 01:15:33,983
[SPEAKER_18]: So we've got those going on.

902
01:15:34,003 --> 01:15:34,903
[SPEAKER_18]: And what else?

903
01:15:36,364 --> 01:15:37,264
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's it.

904
01:15:37,764 --> 01:15:41,865
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are substantial projects that we're working on at the cemetery.

905
01:15:43,339 --> 01:15:52,062
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm happy to answer the questions on the operating budget as well, but it's pretty typical the raises are due to the CBA update.

906
01:16:00,615 --> 01:16:01,836
[SPEAKER_05]: access drive for the Brooks Estate?

907
01:16:02,196 --> 01:16:02,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

908
01:16:02,757 --> 01:16:06,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so it's on the north side of the drive, almost entirely, okay.

909
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:10,763
[SPEAKER_05]: And the remediation on the soil, how's, I mean, I've read the trustees' reports, how's that going?

910
01:16:10,963 --> 01:16:15,387
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, I wouldn't call it remediation necessarily, there was one small amount that needed to be- Removal, removal.

911
01:16:15,427 --> 01:16:16,327
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, that's a better word.

912
01:16:17,288 --> 01:16:25,875
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's going well, so we've been trying to do this in an effective, cost-effective manner for a couple of years now, and we've,

913
01:16:27,236 --> 01:16:31,317
[SPEAKER_18]: We're working with a new environmental engineering company.

914
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:33,358
[SPEAKER_18]: They're actually right in Medford Square Vineyard Engineering.

915
01:16:34,138 --> 01:16:39,319
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're helping us get rid of some of the more contaminated soil.

916
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:40,759
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a little bit of contamination.

917
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,140
[SPEAKER_18]: Who knows where it's from?

918
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:44,460
[SPEAKER_18]: That site has seen many uses over the years.

919
01:16:44,901 --> 01:16:45,981
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's been removed.

920
01:16:46,061 --> 01:16:48,541
[SPEAKER_18]: That's only a very small percentage of the overall pile.

921
01:16:48,802 --> 01:16:50,102
[SPEAKER_18]: The rest of it is, quote unquote, clean.

922
01:16:50,862 --> 01:16:59,267
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll be disposing of that either on site at an engineering project or just to a quarry.

923
01:17:00,327 --> 01:17:00,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

924
01:17:00,667 --> 01:17:11,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know I'm on the MMA public works committee and a lot of public works folks from around the state talking about how the cost of removing dirt

925
01:17:11,903 --> 01:17:15,706
[SPEAKER_05]: is going up and up, so I'm glad to hear it's mostly not contaminated.

926
01:17:15,986 --> 01:17:20,029
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we're getting creative with how to, you know, get rid of it.

927
01:17:20,949 --> 01:17:29,175
[SPEAKER_18]: So, we have some ideas in engineering, we have some ideas at some of our other sites at the cemetery, but... Should we put out an open call?

928
01:17:29,415 --> 01:17:29,776
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

929
01:17:30,036 --> 01:17:31,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we ask the residents if they want any dirt?

930
01:17:32,054 --> 01:17:33,575
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, no.

931
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:38,177
[SPEAKER_18]: Soil moving is very regulated here in Massachusetts.

932
01:17:38,417 --> 01:17:41,619
[SPEAKER_18]: So I could go into details, but there's no need to.

933
01:17:42,319 --> 01:17:42,479
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

934
01:17:44,821 --> 01:17:45,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

935
01:17:45,221 --> 01:17:45,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Tim.

936
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:46,902
[SPEAKER_05]: I just couldn't resist.

937
01:17:47,082 --> 01:17:47,602
[SPEAKER_05]: That's OK.

938
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:50,203
[SPEAKER_18]: I won't go into the difference between dirt and soil.

939
01:17:50,223 --> 01:17:50,984
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll save you guys.

940
01:17:54,312 --> 01:17:55,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's not up to me.

941
01:17:55,873 --> 01:17:57,394
[SPEAKER_05]: If anyone asks, that's what I can do.

942
01:17:58,094 --> 01:17:59,935
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, that sounds good on cemetery.

943
01:17:59,976 --> 01:18:06,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions from members of the council on the cemetery division, soil removal, et cetera?

944
01:18:08,961 --> 01:18:12,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, any questions from members of the public regarding the cemetery division?

945
01:18:15,265 --> 01:18:16,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, engineering.

946
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:19,141
[SPEAKER_05]: We have our City Engineer.

947
01:18:20,982 --> 01:18:23,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Just very quickly, Fiscal 24, the Engineering Division, $495,830.05.

948
01:18:23,283 --> 01:18:23,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiscal 25, $543,661.93.

949
01:18:23,463 --> 01:18:26,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Headcount staying the same at a four headcount for Fiscal 24 and Fiscal 25.

950
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:50,484
[SPEAKER_05]: net increase $47,831.93, and it looks like all of that is fixed cost growth, step increase, clerical unit increase, and the 2% non-union COLA increase.

951
01:18:51,905 --> 01:18:57,431
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to share anything additional about engineering, anything you've been up to this past year, and any plans for next year.

952
01:18:57,922 --> 01:18:58,904
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been up to a lot.

953
01:18:59,565 --> 01:19:00,366
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a lot of plans.

954
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:09,518
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to stick with the CIP and I'm just going to kind of keep it short on time since we've kind of gone over this in the past few meetings and just be mindful of everyone else here.

955
01:19:09,558 --> 01:19:12,322
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you've any stuff that you want to

956
01:19:12,642 --> 01:19:13,302
[SPEAKER_10]: to talk about.

957
01:19:13,322 --> 01:19:14,803
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to.

958
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:25,810
[SPEAKER_10]: But basically our CIP is going to be focused on water replacement and paving roads and sidewalks and any type of infrastructure projects going on.

959
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:29,792
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that we want to do a lot of flood mitigation work in and around the city.

960
01:19:30,212 --> 01:19:33,434
[SPEAKER_10]: We've reached out for a lot of grants to do this work so we can fund it.

961
01:19:34,094 --> 01:19:35,675
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're moving ahead.

962
01:19:35,715 --> 01:19:35,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

963
01:19:37,096 --> 01:19:37,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

964
01:19:38,537 --> 01:19:41,158
[SPEAKER_05]: My only question, or to council's questions.

965
01:19:42,372 --> 01:19:42,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lemming.

966
01:19:44,394 --> 01:19:55,704
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just more of a general engineering staffing question, but I figured while I have you all here, I might as well ask it.

967
01:19:56,945 --> 01:20:03,792
[SPEAKER_11]: We're doing the zoning overhaul, and I think I've talked to Owen about this, but just something I'd like to get a bit more understanding on.

968
01:20:03,852 --> 01:20:07,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of it, which I've been having a lot of meetings on, is implementing

969
01:20:07,615 --> 01:20:21,858
[SPEAKER_11]: transportation, demand management, zoning, ordinance, and I've been kind of shopping around different departments, begging people to fund and put somebody on a TDM study in the future, which would be required at the staff level.

970
01:20:23,638 --> 01:20:32,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Just from my understanding, how much staff time does it usually take to coordinate that, even once you've found a firm that's able to get something like that off the ground?

971
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:34,781
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't have the information for that.

972
01:20:37,415 --> 01:20:43,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Our staff is at its capacity right now, and that would have to be out of one of the on-calls.

973
01:20:45,118 --> 01:20:46,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, one of the on-calls?

974
01:20:46,739 --> 01:20:48,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the on-call consultant engineering.

975
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:50,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you speak more?

976
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:54,762
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be one of the on-call consultants that we have to reach out to do that for.

977
01:20:56,243 --> 01:20:57,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that make sense?

978
01:20:57,845 --> 01:21:03,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so you would reach out to an on-call consultant who would then find the firm to actually do this?

979
01:21:03,812 --> 01:21:15,384
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we have firms that are on-call that are on a three-year contract with us, just about to renew in July, and we would ask them to do what you're describing and what we've talked about before.

980
01:21:16,243 --> 01:21:23,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so it wouldn't actually take any staff time for the people that are being budgeted here?

981
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:25,051
[SPEAKER_11]: You just kind of ask for them to do that?

982
01:21:25,071 --> 01:21:25,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Not necessarily.

983
01:21:25,792 --> 01:21:40,065
[SPEAKER_10]: We do manage a lot of these projects in-house, so while consultants do the work, there is some time that our staff manages to make sure it checks in, make sure that they're spending the money appropriately.

984
01:21:41,389 --> 01:21:47,574
[SPEAKER_11]: And about, I understand that your staff are a capacity, but about how much time does that usually take to check in?

985
01:21:47,994 --> 01:21:50,736
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have that number right now.

986
01:21:51,977 --> 01:21:54,419
[SPEAKER_10]: We're pretty stretched thin at the moment, so.

987
01:21:54,439 --> 01:21:56,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

988
01:21:58,322 --> 01:21:59,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

989
01:21:59,243 --> 01:21:59,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

990
01:22:00,284 --> 01:22:09,611
[SPEAKER_05]: My only question, what maybe in future budgets, not in this budget, would the engineering department be looking for in terms of additional staffing or additional ordinary expenses?

991
01:22:11,283 --> 01:22:18,067
[SPEAKER_10]: It would basically be based on capital improvement plans and projects.

992
01:22:18,728 --> 01:22:26,613
[SPEAKER_10]: So the more we upgrade and ramp up more infrastructure projects, we will need more staff to go along with that.

993
01:22:27,733 --> 01:22:32,356
[SPEAKER_10]: If we don't do that, we're gonna be hiring resident engineers at a higher cost.

994
01:22:32,456 --> 01:22:37,780
[SPEAKER_10]: So we try to plan accordingly.

995
01:22:39,991 --> 01:22:45,298
[SPEAKER_05]: do you expect that level of investment, like given the capital plan that we have now?

996
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:56,933
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a tough question, but is there a certain threshold, like is there a time in this capital plan where you expect the work is going to be so great that you'll need someone new or would it require a bigger capital budget before we get there?

997
01:22:58,803 --> 01:23:00,664
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, the answer is yes.

998
01:23:01,444 --> 01:23:03,485
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's because of some of the things that we've talked about.

999
01:23:04,186 --> 01:23:07,147
[SPEAKER_18]: So the utilities coming to age, for example, right.

1000
01:23:07,287 --> 01:23:16,911
[SPEAKER_18]: So we know we I had a meeting on that today, for example, with one of the on call consulting engineers owners are to talking about, you know, something we'll talk about when water comes along.

1001
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:19,413
[SPEAKER_18]: But to get a grasp of

1002
01:23:20,473 --> 01:23:26,838
[SPEAKER_18]: the amount of both water works, sewer works, drainage works, and roadway works.

1003
01:23:27,338 --> 01:23:37,325
[SPEAKER_18]: We know that some portion of that has to be contracted at engineering soft costs with either on-call engineers or in-house engineers.

1004
01:23:37,785 --> 01:23:40,647
[SPEAKER_18]: on-call engineers are more expensive than in-house engineers.

1005
01:23:40,667 --> 01:23:54,617
[SPEAKER_18]: So, we know that we have tens of millions of dollars worth of work to do just in water alone over the next, I don't know, you know, 10 years, let's say, just kind of making up numbers that we can order of magnitude so we can understand this.

1006
01:23:55,377 --> 01:24:00,020
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, when Owen talks about the CIP, we have it pretty well built out for a couple of years.

1007
01:24:00,601 --> 01:24:03,483
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, three, four, five years, it starts to get a little fuzzy.

1008
01:24:03,623 --> 01:24:04,643
[SPEAKER_18]: That's understandable.

1009
01:24:05,224 --> 01:24:06,625
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's fuzzy to the point that

1010
01:24:07,245 --> 01:24:19,048
[SPEAKER_18]: And today, where we're really relying on that rate study that we're doing with the CIP study to really understand, do we need one more engineer, two more engineers?

1011
01:24:19,068 --> 01:24:20,969
[SPEAKER_18]: How are we going to split it with contract work?

1012
01:24:21,269 --> 01:24:22,509
[SPEAKER_18]: What loans are available?

1013
01:24:22,529 --> 01:24:25,230
[SPEAKER_18]: What are the forgiveness rates with the infrastructure plan?

1014
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:32,572
[SPEAKER_18]: All of these questions come into play almost as soon as the information starts rolling in from that study, which it actually did today.

1015
01:24:33,986 --> 01:24:35,250
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to start.

1016
01:24:36,032 --> 01:24:36,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a little bit.

1017
01:24:37,116 --> 01:24:38,741
[SPEAKER_05]: The first check-in meeting was today, basically.

1018
01:24:39,827 --> 01:24:40,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1019
01:24:40,087 --> 01:24:40,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's great to hear.

1020
01:24:41,188 --> 01:24:44,630
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know how hard you guys are working and how much progress we've made already.

1021
01:24:45,711 --> 01:24:46,731
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been really helpful.

1022
01:24:46,951 --> 01:24:58,338
[SPEAKER_05]: If folks want to reference our late April public works and facilities meeting where you guys give us the update on the street and sidewalk assessments, I think that's a great, great thing to reference so that we don't have to talk about it now.

1023
01:24:59,639 --> 01:25:05,002
[SPEAKER_05]: And really excited that we'll have something similar coming through around our water and sewer infrastructure as well.

1024
01:25:05,483 --> 01:25:07,844
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you so much for your hard work.

1025
01:25:08,304 --> 01:25:09,225
[SPEAKER_05]: It's much appreciated.

1026
01:25:11,913 --> 01:25:15,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further questions for the engineering division, for members of the council?

1027
01:25:16,135 --> 01:25:16,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Collins.

1028
01:25:17,576 --> 01:25:17,897
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1029
01:25:18,317 --> 01:25:20,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Not a question, just thank you for the presentation.

1030
01:25:20,938 --> 01:25:32,826
[SPEAKER_17]: And as you are both as well aware as anybody, you're carrying the load for the stuff in the community that constituents notice and complain about and look forward to improvements on, as much as anybody in the city.

1031
01:25:32,846 --> 01:25:37,309
[SPEAKER_17]: Same goes for your staff, everybody who's working on improving water, sewer, roads, sidewalks.

1032
01:25:39,058 --> 01:25:47,522
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that alongside the year-to-year operational budget planning, there's also the long-term forecasting like you were just speaking about, Commissioner.

1033
01:25:47,683 --> 01:25:50,364
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you for your hard work, and we really appreciate it.

1034
01:25:50,444 --> 01:25:59,148
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think here we get just a glimmer of the magnitudes of planning that have to go into what actually results in improvements that we get to see around the city.

1035
01:25:59,348 --> 01:25:59,628
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1036
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:02,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1037
01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:06,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions from members of the public around engineering?

1038
01:26:07,918 --> 01:26:10,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, in person or on Zoom, we'll go to Forestry Division.

1039
01:26:10,359 --> 01:26:11,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Forestry Division, budget fiscal 24, $616,473.

1040
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:12,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Budget fiscal 25, $623,106.94.

1041
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:14,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Five-person headcount in fiscal 24, five-person headcount in fiscal 25.

1042
01:26:14,901 --> 01:26:17,462
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the increases, fixed cost growth and salaries based on the DPW contract.

1043
01:26:17,482 --> 01:26:18,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn it over to you, Commissioner McGiver.

1044
01:26:33,675 --> 01:26:35,516
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, not a lot to say on forestry.

1045
01:26:35,536 --> 01:26:39,897
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll notice it's more of a modest growth, just that 1% number.

1046
01:26:40,498 --> 01:26:44,319
[SPEAKER_18]: We had, you know, there was some opportunities based on actuals there to trim it up a little bit.

1047
01:26:45,059 --> 01:26:54,723
[SPEAKER_18]: As some of you may recall, a couple of years ago, my first budget, I spent a considerable amount of effort to get forestry where, you know, a step in the right direction.

1048
01:26:54,763 --> 01:26:56,484
[SPEAKER_18]: We had two staff before, now we have four.

1049
01:26:57,004 --> 01:27:00,085
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would call this budget settled at the moment.

1050
01:27:00,525 --> 01:27:02,726
[SPEAKER_18]: It certainly can be revisited in a couple of years.

1051
01:27:04,633 --> 01:27:07,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, any questions?

1052
01:27:07,474 --> 01:27:09,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me, on the forestry budget, Councilor Callahan.

1053
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:12,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have a general question.

1054
01:27:12,075 --> 01:27:21,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that we're having a tree inventory done, and I've come to understand that we probably lose more trees than we plant each year.

1055
01:27:21,939 --> 01:27:31,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a dream for the forestry department that would allow us to plant as many trees as we lose each year?

1056
01:27:31,974 --> 01:27:32,834
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a great question.

1057
01:27:33,435 --> 01:27:38,358
[SPEAKER_18]: So another project we're working on besides the inventory is a vulnerability analysis.

1058
01:27:38,698 --> 01:27:42,440
[SPEAKER_18]: And that really is going to lead us towards both of those things.

1059
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:47,663
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to lead us towards having enough information for basically an urban forestry plant.

1060
01:27:48,183 --> 01:27:48,903
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have that right now.

1061
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:56,387
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have no basis of saying that we need to plant x number of trees more every year to sustain.

1062
01:27:56,448 --> 01:27:57,848
[SPEAKER_18]: And we need to plant them over here.

1063
01:27:58,289 --> 01:28:00,370
[SPEAKER_18]: And we need to plant this species with that one.

1064
01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:02,151
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have that information right now.

1065
01:28:02,651 --> 01:28:05,513
[SPEAKER_18]: So my dream is what the word you use.

1066
01:28:05,553 --> 01:28:11,837
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I call it a vision, but the vision would be that I have that document in my hand.

1067
01:28:11,997 --> 01:28:20,522
[SPEAKER_18]: I can share it with my tree warden and we can we can understand the order of magnitude of the work that we need to do over.

1068
01:28:21,382 --> 01:28:23,783
[SPEAKER_18]: a period of time, just like everything else.

1069
01:28:24,763 --> 01:28:26,664
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's where we're headed.

1070
01:28:27,525 --> 01:28:40,790
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what those documents look like yet, but I do know that the data is looking good that I've seen, and some of the graphics and information that I've seen in the vulnerability work is also pretty impressive at this point.

1071
01:28:40,810 --> 01:28:41,910
[SPEAKER_18]: So looking forward to it.

1072
01:28:42,830 --> 01:28:47,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to follow up, do you know when we'll get the geometry and the vulnerability assessment?

1073
01:28:47,977 --> 01:28:52,099
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we're due, tree inventory I believe is wrapping up.

1074
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,721
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we added on to a little bit.

1075
01:28:55,121 --> 01:28:58,463
[SPEAKER_18]: I would imagine that should be done soon, summer.

1076
01:28:59,283 --> 01:29:06,066
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the vulnerability project that is MVP funded has a deadline wrap up at the end of June.

1077
01:29:07,767 --> 01:29:14,631
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we are going for another grant to extend that to a year from now, June.

1078
01:29:16,105 --> 01:29:20,189
[SPEAKER_18]: to continue the efforts to get to that master plan.

1079
01:29:20,449 --> 01:29:27,316
[SPEAKER_18]: But June deadline was when one round ends, so we'll have a document, a deliverable, yeah.

1080
01:29:28,056 --> 01:29:30,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further questions from members of the council regarding the forestry division?

1081
01:29:33,882 --> 01:29:39,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, any questions or comments from members of the public on the forestry division at the podium or on Zoom?

1082
01:29:43,291 --> 01:29:45,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, we will move to Highway Division.

1083
01:29:49,412 --> 01:29:49,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiscal 24, budget $11,624,596.

1084
01:29:50,013 --> 01:29:52,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiscal 25, budget $12,475,611.23, increase $851,015.23,

1085
01:30:09,161 --> 01:30:13,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Headcount 24, headcount remaining at 24 for fiscal 25.

1086
01:30:14,944 --> 01:30:19,167
[SPEAKER_05]: And the entirety of this is also, again, all fixed cost growth.

1087
01:30:19,227 --> 01:30:27,031
[SPEAKER_05]: We have about 120,000 related to COLA increases and the contract changes for the 24 staff members.

1088
01:30:27,531 --> 01:30:33,635
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have, excuse me, a big increase here in our newly negotiated budget.

1089
01:30:34,685 --> 01:30:36,005
[SPEAKER_05]: waste management contract.

1090
01:30:36,105 --> 01:30:39,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are going from seven.

1091
01:30:40,446 --> 01:30:42,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming everything in 5293 is the waste contract.

1092
01:30:42,987 --> 01:30:44,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else in there?

1093
01:30:44,627 --> 01:30:44,407
8.7?

1094
01:30:44,667 --> 01:30:47,288
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going from 7938 to 8727?

1095
01:30:47,328 --> 01:30:47,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1096
01:30:47,948 --> 01:30:48,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1097
01:30:50,028 --> 01:30:50,348
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct.

1098
01:30:50,508 --> 01:30:52,489
[SPEAKER_18]: It's three contracts instead of one now.

1099
01:30:53,069 --> 01:30:53,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1100
01:30:53,289 --> 01:30:54,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the new three.

1101
01:30:54,809 --> 01:30:55,169
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct.

1102
01:30:58,010 --> 01:30:58,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so we can clarify that.

1103
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:02,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to just point out that that's about a 10% increase, which is more than 2.5%.

1104
01:31:03,672 --> 01:31:04,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to leave it at that.

1105
01:31:05,094 --> 01:31:08,578
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, just to provide a little clarity on that number, it's a conservative number.

1106
01:31:08,758 --> 01:31:09,379
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's put it that way.

1107
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,201
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a new contract.

1108
01:31:11,542 --> 01:31:15,587
[SPEAKER_18]: There are some unknowns, more so in year one than in year 10 on a contract like this.

1109
01:31:18,859 --> 01:31:21,442
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think we're going to end up spending $8.7 million, put it that way.

1110
01:31:22,263 --> 01:31:27,707
[SPEAKER_18]: There is a buffer in there because of the unknowns, the recycling costs, processing, for example.

1111
01:31:28,508 --> 01:31:29,509
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't know what that's going to do.

1112
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:33,893
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, we could spend it all.

1113
01:31:33,913 --> 01:31:34,414
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope we don't.

1114
01:31:34,534 --> 01:31:35,495
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a bad sign if we do.

1115
01:31:36,135 --> 01:31:36,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

1116
01:31:36,855 --> 01:31:37,135
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1117
01:31:38,235 --> 01:31:48,557
[SPEAKER_05]: And just on that note, when we move to year three of the contract or year four, whenever the biweekly trash kicks in, is that going to drop our rate?

1118
01:31:48,957 --> 01:31:50,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we expecting like a reduction at all?

1119
01:31:51,658 --> 01:31:55,699
[SPEAKER_18]: There is, but the reduction is actually spread out over the life of the contract.

1120
01:31:55,999 --> 01:31:56,379
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1121
01:31:56,919 --> 01:31:59,099
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was to make it affordable year to year.

1122
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,800
[SPEAKER_18]: So we actually have a credit at the beginning.

1123
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:06,204
[SPEAKER_18]: That we, you know, resolves itself, I think, in like year 5 or 6 or something.

1124
01:32:06,544 --> 01:32:07,385
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, great.

1125
01:32:07,565 --> 01:32:07,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1126
01:32:09,447 --> 01:32:16,173
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of the highway division, anything you want to talk about that you've done over fiscal 24 and any big plans for fiscal 25?

1127
01:32:16,633 --> 01:32:22,179
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I just want to note that the trash budget in here is like 66% of the highway division.

1128
01:32:22,299 --> 01:32:26,623
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we talk about $12 million for the highway division, most of that is trash removal.

1129
01:32:27,045 --> 01:32:33,388
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, highways are our biggest budget and actually, sorry, water is our biggest budget, but our biggest budget in the general fund world.

1130
01:32:34,188 --> 01:32:35,929
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's also the catch-all budget.

1131
01:32:36,529 --> 01:32:41,331
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, we pay fleet out of there and we take care of all the fleet, the city, police and fire.

1132
01:32:42,312 --> 01:32:43,832
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's important to know.

1133
01:32:44,153 --> 01:32:49,055
[SPEAKER_18]: Also clerical administration, me, new deputy are all out of the highway budget.

1134
01:32:49,395 --> 01:32:53,977
[SPEAKER_18]: So anyway, it's kind of deceiving when you look at it to just, you know,

1135
01:32:54,657 --> 01:32:56,939
[SPEAKER_18]: some of your new counselors, so I just want you to understand that.

1136
01:32:56,999 --> 01:33:02,785
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a little bit hard to understand if you don't know who the people are, for example.

1137
01:33:03,766 --> 01:33:14,456
[SPEAKER_18]: With that said, I'll take this opportunity just to go over, you know, sort of the DPW's budget, and I know probably Bob has talked to you about this as well, but

1138
01:33:15,717 --> 01:33:20,040
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, the water enterprise fund is about 63% of our budget.

1139
01:33:21,021 --> 01:33:23,903
[SPEAKER_18]: We buy about $22 million worth of water.

1140
01:33:24,043 --> 01:33:28,266
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's also something that sort of makes our budget look bigger than it actually is.

1141
01:33:28,726 --> 01:33:30,947
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't really have a 40 plus million dollar budget.

1142
01:33:30,968 --> 01:33:32,529
[SPEAKER_18]: It's more like a $20 million budget.

1143
01:33:33,749 --> 01:33:35,651
[SPEAKER_18]: Then about 36% is general fund.

1144
01:33:36,131 --> 01:33:40,154
[SPEAKER_18]: And we also have some perpetual care and sales lots in there as well.

1145
01:33:41,114 --> 01:33:41,995
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's kind of the,

1146
01:33:43,456 --> 01:33:45,697
[SPEAKER_18]: the overall pie chart of it.

1147
01:33:46,637 --> 01:33:51,859
[SPEAKER_18]: Water and sewers are biggest, highways second, cemetery, parks, forestry, engineering coming in after that.

1148
01:33:53,299 --> 01:33:57,040
[SPEAKER_18]: And some of the highlights from this year, deputy is the biggest one.

1149
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:59,021
[SPEAKER_18]: So we just hired a deputy, he started this week.

1150
01:33:59,281 --> 01:34:01,322
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's fantastic.

1151
01:34:02,102 --> 01:34:03,102
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been spread very thin.

1152
01:34:03,322 --> 01:34:11,665
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is gonna give me an opportunity to focus on some of the bigger picture items and have this gentleman, Scott Brink, focus on operations.

1153
01:34:13,625 --> 01:34:14,225
[SPEAKER_18]: That's exciting.

1154
01:34:15,166 --> 01:34:21,267
[SPEAKER_18]: We have, as you know, from alone, we now have some in-house paving equipment that we've been trained on.

1155
01:34:21,568 --> 01:34:22,528
[SPEAKER_18]: That's very exciting.

1156
01:34:23,188 --> 01:34:25,929
[SPEAKER_18]: We talked a little bit about that in our subcommittee meeting.

1157
01:34:25,949 --> 01:34:30,270
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see, we have three new waste contracts.

1158
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:32,151
[SPEAKER_18]: That's also a very big thing.

1159
01:34:33,271 --> 01:34:39,213
[SPEAKER_18]: So as we just talked about a little bit, we're moving to a system that collects compost,

1160
01:34:40,353 --> 01:34:44,935
[SPEAKER_18]: trash, recycling, and yard waste, the compost is what's different.

1161
01:34:46,375 --> 01:34:56,099
[SPEAKER_18]: Compost makes up a lot of your trash weight, and it's typically the element of trash that attracts things like rodents.

1162
01:34:56,119 --> 01:35:03,642
[SPEAKER_18]: So the idea would be, and trash disposal costs are going up and up and up, so the idea is to separate the compostables,

1163
01:35:04,882 --> 01:35:10,825
[SPEAKER_18]: make soil from that, and then to reduce the amount of trash, cunnage we have.

1164
01:35:11,666 --> 01:35:18,089
[SPEAKER_18]: So folks may have received something in the mail alerting them to signing up for compost.

1165
01:35:18,149 --> 01:35:19,330
[SPEAKER_18]: We're collecting a waiting list now.

1166
01:35:20,070 --> 01:35:23,932
[SPEAKER_18]: And that service begins in July, but it's limited first year.

1167
01:35:23,952 --> 01:35:25,233
[SPEAKER_18]: So first come, first serve.

1168
01:35:25,993 --> 01:35:26,853
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's important.

1169
01:35:28,769 --> 01:35:33,871
[SPEAKER_18]: And then there's some other things I just want to mention that you may know about, but you may not.

1170
01:35:33,911 --> 01:35:38,113
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not all highway related, but it's just because highway is sort of the catch-all budget.

1171
01:35:38,513 --> 01:35:45,936
[SPEAKER_18]: We're doing a lot of water quality regulatory work that's in preparation for new rules that the EPA is

1172
01:35:47,637 --> 01:35:50,699
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, making that go into effect in October.

1173
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:53,161
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's a lot of work there to prepare for that.

1174
01:35:53,922 --> 01:36:10,054
[SPEAKER_18]: We bought a camera van, so that allows us to camera our own pipes before we were doing that via contract work, but the technology is affordable, so we can do that in-house now, which is going to save us about $200,000 per year, something like that.

1175
01:36:10,855 --> 01:36:13,237
[SPEAKER_18]: So we kind of did that in the budget, I think, last year.

1176
01:36:13,937 --> 01:36:16,578
[SPEAKER_18]: that we did that this year, trained up on it.

1177
01:36:16,658 --> 01:36:18,919
[SPEAKER_18]: And we got a couple of guys that are really excited about it and using it.

1178
01:36:19,019 --> 01:36:20,520
[SPEAKER_18]: It's turning out really great.

1179
01:36:21,701 --> 01:36:23,181
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a new water quality controller.

1180
01:36:23,802 --> 01:36:28,844
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a couple of field improvements that we did.

1181
01:36:28,904 --> 01:36:33,746
[SPEAKER_18]: We helped the school system and their varsity team do some refurbishment on play set field.

1182
01:36:34,287 --> 01:36:36,508
[SPEAKER_18]: We redid the courts at Hickey Park.

1183
01:36:37,408 --> 01:36:40,189
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're trying to line up two more for this year.

1184
01:36:42,010 --> 01:36:43,491
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see what else?

1185
01:36:43,511 --> 01:36:48,295
[SPEAKER_18]: Owen didn't talk about this, but a lot of people have been asking questions about the work we did up at the dam.

1186
01:36:48,735 --> 01:36:53,138
[SPEAKER_18]: So we did do some maintenance work up there that was significant.

1187
01:36:54,179 --> 01:36:55,380
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the dam at Wrights Pond?

1188
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:56,141
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct, yeah.

1189
01:36:56,481 --> 01:36:57,802
[SPEAKER_18]: We only operate one dam.

1190
01:36:57,862 --> 01:36:58,822
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the Wrights Pond dam.

1191
01:36:59,883 --> 01:37:04,887
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, some people may see some changes up there, but it's all normal and it's what we're supposed to be doing.

1192
01:37:06,548 --> 01:37:20,460
[SPEAKER_18]: Lots of personnel movements within DPW this year due to folks leaving positions, getting filled within the union, which kind of causes a domino effect up the totem pole, so to speak.

1193
01:37:20,881 --> 01:37:25,024
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's been a pretty exciting thing.

1194
01:37:25,385 --> 01:37:27,927
[SPEAKER_18]: New faces in new positions, learning new skills.

1195
01:37:28,427 --> 01:37:29,048
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's good to see.

1196
01:37:30,609 --> 01:37:37,371
[SPEAKER_18]: Another thing Owen didn't really talk about, but I'll talk about, his office has made some significant improvements to the permitting process around here.

1197
01:37:37,591 --> 01:37:49,014
[SPEAKER_18]: And he's, I think, doing a fantastic job holding utility companies accountable, taking on some of the work that I had hoped to have more time working on when I was city engineer.

1198
01:37:49,334 --> 01:37:52,375
[SPEAKER_18]: And he picked it up, and he's been doing a great job with that.

1199
01:37:52,395 --> 01:37:57,437
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's really helping us with our pavement work and making sure we fix those

1200
01:37:58,157 --> 01:38:02,359
[SPEAKER_18]: fix those gas sinkholes that seem to pop up all over the city because of their trench work.

1201
01:38:03,099 --> 01:38:10,323
[SPEAKER_18]: Other exciting things is some things that we got going last year, flushing program.

1202
01:38:10,983 --> 01:38:18,207
[SPEAKER_18]: We talked about the rate study for water, CIP with the rate study, and then doing a hydraulic model.

1203
01:38:18,307 --> 01:38:19,408
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are all very exciting things.

1204
01:38:20,388 --> 01:38:21,849
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we talked about the tree inventory.

1205
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:25,513
[SPEAKER_18]: So just wanted to give that sort of overview of some of the things that are happening.

1206
01:38:25,753 --> 01:38:34,260
[SPEAKER_18]: As far as next year goes, what I'd really like to continue doing is making significant improvements to operations.

1207
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:36,923
[SPEAKER_18]: Now that I have a deputy, I'm going to be able to do that.

1208
01:38:37,743 --> 01:38:39,225
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's really what I'm looking forward to.

1209
01:38:39,725 --> 01:38:41,066
[SPEAKER_18]: And that has all kinds of benefits.

1210
01:38:42,407 --> 01:38:44,709
[SPEAKER_18]: If you understand operations, you know what I'm talking about.

1211
01:38:44,749 --> 01:38:45,290
[SPEAKER_18]: If not, that's OK.

1212
01:38:45,430 --> 01:38:46,191
[SPEAKER_18]: I can answer questions.

1213
01:38:48,041 --> 01:38:59,550
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I'm also excited about the new pavement equipment and seeing if I can get more use out of that to save resources when it comes to potholing.

1214
01:38:59,630 --> 01:39:04,054
[SPEAKER_18]: I think a lot of people see the same places being potholed over and over again.

1215
01:39:04,774 --> 01:39:13,483
[SPEAKER_18]: So the idea would be is we now have the equipment to replace that as a box out, as well as being able to do our own longer sidewalk repairs.

1216
01:39:13,863 --> 01:39:15,645
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's more to come there.

1217
01:39:16,545 --> 01:39:19,969
[SPEAKER_18]: And we've talked about some of the future ideas I have for that.

1218
01:39:20,409 --> 01:39:26,915
[SPEAKER_18]: So I hold those visions close and I'm trying to pick away at them as much as I can.

1219
01:39:28,902 --> 01:39:29,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1220
01:39:29,562 --> 01:39:31,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Commissioner for the Highway Division.

1221
01:39:31,824 --> 01:39:33,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions from members of the Council on the Highway Division?

1222
01:39:33,745 --> 01:39:34,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Callahan.

1223
01:39:35,427 --> 01:39:43,812
[SPEAKER_02]: The compost, you say you're building a list, and currently we have a relationship with Is It Garbage to Garden?

1224
01:39:44,153 --> 01:39:45,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

1225
01:39:45,253 --> 01:39:48,896
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that how the list is built, is through them, or is there also a separate list?

1226
01:39:49,474 --> 01:39:50,074
[SPEAKER_18]: I do them.

1227
01:39:50,394 --> 01:39:56,335
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's, uh, there should be, you know, garbage to garden has, uh, all kinds of resources that they've already put out there.

1228
01:39:56,455 --> 01:40:01,516
[SPEAKER_18]: I know we have links on the website to sign up and you've heard compost.com.

1229
01:40:01,796 --> 01:40:01,956
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1230
01:40:01,996 --> 01:40:02,936
[SPEAKER_18]: Medford compost.com.

1231
01:40:03,076 --> 01:40:03,396
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it.

1232
01:40:03,937 --> 01:40:04,417
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, thank you.

1233
01:40:05,337 --> 01:40:09,998
[SPEAKER_18]: And, um, so you just, you sign up there and, uh, like I said, I think you would see the 6,000, 8,000.

1234
01:40:10,398 --> 01:40:11,658
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't remember.

1235
01:40:11,678 --> 01:40:13,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it four, eight, 12, right?

1236
01:40:13,498 --> 01:40:16,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Say again, four in the first year, eight in the second year, 12 in the third year.

1237
01:40:16,939 --> 01:40:18,179
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I think it's six in first year.

1238
01:40:19,534 --> 01:40:21,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you may have negotiated that after we last talked.

1239
01:40:21,556 --> 01:40:22,316
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe, maybe.

1240
01:40:22,496 --> 01:40:23,797
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, don't please don't hold me to a number.

1241
01:40:23,877 --> 01:40:24,358
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a number.

1242
01:40:24,378 --> 01:40:25,158
[SPEAKER_18]: It's in the thousands.

1243
01:40:25,219 --> 01:40:28,161
[SPEAKER_18]: It's in the single digit thousands that we're capping off for year one.

1244
01:40:28,641 --> 01:40:31,484
[SPEAKER_18]: Then it opens up year two more, and then year three.

1245
01:40:31,564 --> 01:40:35,167
[SPEAKER_18]: We're hopeful to get everybody on board in year three.

1246
01:40:35,607 --> 01:40:41,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just so that I understand, that is through Garbage to Garden that we're doing our long-term compost project.

1247
01:40:41,192 --> 01:40:43,073
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to end up being in the city.

1248
01:40:43,834 --> 01:40:45,675
[SPEAKER_18]: No, we have a contract with Garbage to Garden.

1249
01:40:45,695 --> 01:40:45,935
[SPEAKER_18]: Perfect.

1250
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:48,631
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the three contracts.

1251
01:40:48,951 --> 01:40:53,075
[SPEAKER_05]: It's waste management, trash, waste management, recycling, garbage to garden, compost?

1252
01:40:53,455 --> 01:40:53,615
[SPEAKER_18]: Nope.

1253
01:40:53,815 --> 01:41:00,000
[SPEAKER_18]: Waste management, trash, and recycling, garbage to garden, compost, and then save that stuff yard waste.

1254
01:41:00,541 --> 01:41:00,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

1255
01:41:01,422 --> 01:41:01,662
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

1256
01:41:03,523 --> 01:41:05,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions on the highway division?

1257
01:41:07,747 --> 01:41:08,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one, Tim.

1258
01:41:09,008 --> 01:41:09,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1259
01:41:09,628 --> 01:41:11,670
[SPEAKER_05]: The reduction in the sidewalk repairs budget from $90,000 to $50,000.

1260
01:41:14,471 --> 01:41:15,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we making that up somewhere else?

1261
01:41:16,772 --> 01:41:19,472
[SPEAKER_05]: How is that going to impact what we can do there?

1262
01:41:20,692 --> 01:41:24,353
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not going to impact what we do, at least for this year.

1263
01:41:25,533 --> 01:41:27,174
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the line that we use to buy concrete.

1264
01:41:27,934 --> 01:41:30,515
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't bought a lot of concrete, so the actuals are lower.

1265
01:41:30,735 --> 01:41:33,315
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm focusing more on asphalt work, actually, to tell you the truth.

1266
01:41:33,415 --> 01:41:36,276
[SPEAKER_18]: We do have some concrete work to do, but

1267
01:41:37,356 --> 01:41:40,337
[SPEAKER_18]: As we've discussed before, it's not like I have a sidewalk crew that can pour concrete every day.

1268
01:41:41,357 --> 01:41:51,599
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's much more efficient for things like sidewalk repairs to do them in asphalt at first, usually, and then come back and do them in concrete.

1269
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:56,780
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what you're seeing is, if you look at the asphalt line, that one's bent down.

1270
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:01,041
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that as that's based on actuals,

1271
01:42:02,341 --> 01:42:04,882
[SPEAKER_18]: As we move forward year to year, I want that to go up.

1272
01:42:04,942 --> 01:42:10,704
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to be spending more on concrete in-house and I'm trying to line up as much as we can do this year as well.

1273
01:42:11,124 --> 01:42:11,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we've talked about it.

1274
01:42:11,965 --> 01:42:18,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to bring home a couple of questions and a couple of nuances that have come before me even since we last talked about it.

1275
01:42:18,787 --> 01:42:18,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1276
01:42:19,367 --> 01:42:25,849
[SPEAKER_05]: What's generally the timeline between a temporary asphalt patch and a concrete filling with concrete?

1277
01:42:25,989 --> 01:42:27,630
[SPEAKER_05]: How long is that usually lasting right now?

1278
01:42:28,072 --> 01:42:30,833
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, it's going to depend on who does it.

1279
01:42:31,393 --> 01:42:44,597
[SPEAKER_18]: So if it's, let's say, for example, a water repair that is scheduled with our water division, then that gets on a list.

1280
01:42:44,837 --> 01:42:49,819
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'd say within usually a couple of months, that goes from asphalt back to concrete.

1281
01:42:50,439 --> 01:42:51,440
[SPEAKER_18]: But then there are

1282
01:42:53,103 --> 01:42:57,227
[SPEAKER_18]: There are other issues where it doesn't always make sense to put back concrete.

1283
01:42:57,387 --> 01:42:58,609
[SPEAKER_18]: We find that a lot around trees.

1284
01:42:59,530 --> 01:43:01,672
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're not going to put the concrete back a lot of the times.

1285
01:43:03,473 --> 01:43:09,299
[SPEAKER_18]: Once I have a little bit more time and Owen has some breathing room, we're going to spend some more time investigating alternative materials around trees.

1286
01:43:11,141 --> 01:43:14,962
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now, neither material is good that we use, asphalt or concrete.

1287
01:43:15,582 --> 01:43:17,083
[SPEAKER_18]: So there are materials out there.

1288
01:43:18,024 --> 01:43:22,125
[SPEAKER_18]: They're expensive, they're finicky, they require different types of maintenance.

1289
01:43:22,906 --> 01:43:25,227
[SPEAKER_18]: There are success stories and there are failure stories.

1290
01:43:25,627 --> 01:43:32,310
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's about, you know, spending some time to figure out what the right one is and then working to fund it and figure out how to do it.

1291
01:43:34,231 --> 01:43:39,353
[SPEAKER_05]: And my other question, you kind of got there, where we have, you know,

1292
01:43:40,959 --> 01:43:49,949
[SPEAKER_05]: older trees planted in sidewalks that are basically shortening and narrowing the sidewalk or the roots are uprooting and it's an asphalt patch.

1293
01:43:51,991 --> 01:44:00,980
[SPEAKER_05]: How is the department making decisions between forestry and highway and your team around prioritizing saving healthy trees versus

1294
01:44:01,781 --> 01:44:07,163
[SPEAKER_05]: allowing for accessibility for people in wheelchairs and other forms of mobility devices.

1295
01:44:08,023 --> 01:44:09,384
[SPEAKER_05]: How are we working through that conundrum?

1296
01:44:09,404 --> 01:44:11,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I understand it's a difficult one.

1297
01:44:12,405 --> 01:44:13,225
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't mean to do that, sorry.

1298
01:44:13,445 --> 01:44:17,327
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a little bit of a difficult situation.

1299
01:44:17,347 --> 01:44:21,368
[SPEAKER_18]: However, the good thing is that Mass General Law has pretty clear guidance on this.

1300
01:44:21,989 --> 01:44:26,851
[SPEAKER_18]: Trees are protected, and ADA accessibility is also the rule of the land.

1301
01:44:28,912 --> 01:44:30,394
[SPEAKER_18]: you do have these conflicting issues.

1302
01:44:30,454 --> 01:44:35,239
[SPEAKER_18]: So really the obligation of the city is to try to figure out a way to honor both.

1303
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,962
[SPEAKER_18]: That's almost impossible.

1304
01:44:38,903 --> 01:44:48,253
[SPEAKER_18]: However, I just recently went to Charleston, South Carolina, and I was impressed by the way that they do it because their old oak trees are protected.

1305
01:44:49,474 --> 01:44:52,236
[SPEAKER_18]: And they have been growing in the street for a very long time.

1306
01:44:52,656 --> 01:44:54,857
[SPEAKER_18]: And they will literally build the street around the tree.

1307
01:44:55,057 --> 01:44:57,138
[SPEAKER_18]: So some of the trees are just in the middle of the road.

1308
01:44:57,579 --> 01:45:01,501
[SPEAKER_18]: And so they've redesigned the road basically around the tree.

1309
01:45:02,061 --> 01:45:04,842
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm not saying that we're going to do that here this year.

1310
01:45:04,862 --> 01:45:07,664
[SPEAKER_05]: But certainly not for every single one.

1311
01:45:08,244 --> 01:45:10,005
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, right.

1312
01:45:10,285 --> 01:45:18,849
[SPEAKER_18]: There are trees that are out there that are 100 plus years old that there's no way that our tree warden is going to say, let's cut down that tree.

1313
01:45:19,629 --> 01:45:23,070
[SPEAKER_18]: And she has that authority, especially if it's a healthy tree.

1314
01:45:23,691 --> 01:45:28,393
[SPEAKER_18]: But then, of course, you have a situation where someone with a stroller or a wheelchair can't get by.

1315
01:45:29,613 --> 01:45:35,215
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's got to be a design solution that saves the tree to do that.

1316
01:45:36,677 --> 01:45:44,157
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't, there's thousands of these locations all over the city, so we just gotta pick away at them one at a time, unless we have...

1317
01:45:45,765 --> 01:45:50,609
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, some big project that is gonna solve a good chunk of them or the worst ones.

1318
01:45:50,769 --> 01:45:57,894
[SPEAKER_18]: So now there is some synergy between that and the sidewalk assessment and the work that we're trying to do on the sidewalks.

1319
01:45:58,995 --> 01:46:09,443
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I don't know if it's been shared with this body in particular, but the sidewalk heat map that we have that shows

1320
01:46:10,703 --> 01:46:16,347
[SPEAKER_18]: where the high foot traffic is compared to the sidewalk repair that needs to happen.

1321
01:46:16,727 --> 01:46:18,468
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of those sidewalk repairs are around trees.

1322
01:46:18,948 --> 01:46:26,253
[SPEAKER_18]: So that automatically goes into the queue for Owen and his team to assess, are we doing this block of sidewalk or that one?

1323
01:46:26,293 --> 01:46:27,394
[SPEAKER_18]: And then when we do that,

1324
01:46:28,374 --> 01:46:29,736
[SPEAKER_18]: the trees are taken into consideration.

1325
01:46:30,136 --> 01:46:31,137
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's the opportunity.

1326
01:46:31,197 --> 01:46:32,679
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we need to ramp up the grade?

1327
01:46:32,859 --> 01:46:36,563
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we need to do anything drastic like take somebody's land?

1328
01:46:36,603 --> 01:46:42,369
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we need a foot of property on someone's property, or maybe we need to change the width of the road and move some curbing around.

1329
01:46:42,709 --> 01:46:44,751
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are the ways you solve those types of problems.

1330
01:46:46,794 --> 01:46:47,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

1331
01:46:47,194 --> 01:46:47,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1332
01:46:48,055 --> 01:46:49,817
[SPEAKER_05]: When you were in Charleston, did you make it to City Hall?

1333
01:46:51,027 --> 01:46:54,131
[SPEAKER_18]: I drove in a tour horse carriage.

1334
01:46:54,151 --> 01:46:54,992
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, wow.

1335
01:46:55,012 --> 01:46:55,633
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it was cool.

1336
01:46:55,893 --> 01:46:56,554
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool.

1337
01:46:56,574 --> 01:46:57,856
[SPEAKER_18]: It was cool, yeah.

1338
01:46:58,337 --> 01:47:01,040
[SPEAKER_18]: The ADPW cleans up the horses.

1339
01:47:01,821 --> 01:47:02,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1340
01:47:02,182 --> 01:47:03,564
[SPEAKER_18]: So anyway, cleans up the horses.

1341
01:47:03,624 --> 01:47:04,765
[SPEAKER_05]: So should we work on that, or?

1342
01:47:05,586 --> 01:47:06,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we have enough horses.

1343
01:47:06,868 --> 01:47:06,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1344
01:47:08,810 --> 01:47:13,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to know that the clerk was there, he might have something to say, but their council chambers gorgeous.

1345
01:47:13,395 --> 01:47:15,937
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if you want to.

1346
01:47:17,398 --> 01:47:26,727
[SPEAKER_16]: I was walking down the street and we walked past city hall and I said to my wife, let's go see the city clerk and she was kind enough to give us a tour of City Hall and took us to their council chamber and.

1347
01:47:27,808 --> 01:47:28,449
[SPEAKER_16]: It was amazing.

1348
01:47:28,509 --> 01:47:30,991
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was I was also impressed by Charleston.

1349
01:47:31,371 --> 01:47:31,511
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1350
01:47:31,811 --> 01:47:34,573
[SPEAKER_05]: What do they have, a multimillion dollar Washington portrait in their council chamber?

1351
01:47:34,593 --> 01:47:37,415
[SPEAKER_16]: They had she told me they have like 40 million dollars worth of art on the walls.

1352
01:47:37,435 --> 01:47:45,141
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, there's one that's like it's like there's a portrait of George Washington that they're having trouble insuring because it's because it costs because it's it's so valuable.

1353
01:47:45,542 --> 01:47:45,742
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.

1354
01:47:46,042 --> 01:47:47,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Paging director Ricky.

1355
01:47:50,566 --> 01:47:51,146
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, yes.

1356
01:47:51,686 --> 01:47:52,027
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1357
01:47:52,087 --> 01:47:52,427
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in.

1358
01:47:53,468 --> 01:47:53,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Tim.

1359
01:47:55,299 --> 01:47:58,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions from members of the Council, again, on the Highway Division?

1360
01:48:00,020 --> 01:48:03,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Any comments from members of the public, either in person or on Zoom?

1361
01:48:08,363 --> 01:48:11,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, we'll go to Parks, Parks Division.

1362
01:48:12,722 --> 01:48:13,822
[SPEAKER_05]: in fiscal 24, maintaining it eight in fiscal 25.

1363
01:48:13,862 --> 01:48:21,204
[SPEAKER_05]: $951,016 in fiscal 24 up to $957,577.56 in fiscal 25 for an increase of $6,561.56, about 1%, and all of that is in DPW contract increases for the salary, so it's all fixed cost growth, and it does look like some of that was obviously offset by some reductions.

1364
01:48:21,224 --> 01:48:21,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Commissioner McGovern.

1365
01:48:42,082 --> 01:48:42,262
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

1366
01:48:42,402 --> 01:48:42,962
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

1367
01:48:43,442 --> 01:48:48,024
[SPEAKER_18]: So I went over some of the things that we've been working on in parks, the field refurbishments.

1368
01:48:48,344 --> 01:48:50,044
[SPEAKER_18]: Parks is pretty simple, like forestry.

1369
01:48:50,505 --> 01:48:56,546
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now I feel like we have full staff and we have new leadership.

1370
01:48:57,347 --> 01:48:58,127
[SPEAKER_18]: Things are going great.

1371
01:48:59,087 --> 01:49:13,453
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot to be said for the hard work that the Parks Department puts in this time of year right now, making sure that the 15 fields we have operating right now are playable every day.

1372
01:49:13,954 --> 01:49:15,034
[SPEAKER_18]: So props to them.

1373
01:49:16,215 --> 01:49:18,616
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, a modest increase here.

1374
01:49:19,116 --> 01:49:23,838
[SPEAKER_18]: The fixed costs are really the thing that's happening there, and then some trims based on actuals.

1375
01:49:25,981 --> 01:49:29,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, any questions from members of the council regarding the parks division?

1376
01:49:32,644 --> 01:49:35,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, any questions from members of the public regarding the parks division?

1377
01:49:38,087 --> 01:49:40,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, that concludes the general fund DPW.

1378
01:49:41,069 --> 01:49:47,512
[SPEAKER_05]: So all the departments we just discussed were coming out of the general fund, which the biggest funder is the property tax levy.

1379
01:49:47,932 --> 01:49:52,395
[SPEAKER_05]: We're now going into water sewer enterprise fund, which is funded by the water and sewer rate payers.

1380
01:49:53,702 --> 01:50:00,469
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have in water sewer enterprise fiscal 24 budget 25,956,537 fiscal 25 budget 26,879,692 dollars and 12 cents.

1381
01:50:09,716 --> 01:50:20,086
[SPEAKER_05]: increase $923,155.12, going from a headcount of 21 to a headcount of 20, and that's about a 4% increase in the budget.

1382
01:50:21,327 --> 01:50:31,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of that is in fixed costs of about $1.1 million, the vast majority of that being the contract increase with the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, which is going up

1383
01:50:31,857 --> 01:50:38,761
[SPEAKER_05]: $784,517.

1384
01:50:31,877 --> 01:50:38,761
[SPEAKER_05]: There are also a number of other contracts going up significantly for $150,000 and $88,000 increase based on the new DPW contract for staff and staff raises.

1385
01:50:47,485 --> 01:50:51,327
[SPEAKER_05]: and some increased costs for field work around water mains and stormwater.

1386
01:50:51,868 --> 01:50:53,328
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also some new expenses.

1387
01:50:53,409 --> 01:51:03,614
[SPEAKER_05]: This is only the third time we've seen that all budget, and it's for two printers, safety equipment, and parts to replace fire hydrants.

1388
01:51:04,775 --> 01:51:10,258
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, again, 1.1 million in fixed costs, 800,000 of that is MWRA.

1389
01:51:10,558 --> 01:51:14,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Only 42,000 is a new expense, and it seems for some pretty basic stuff.

1390
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:16,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll turn it over to you, Commissioner McGimmer.

1391
01:51:16,297 --> 01:51:20,400
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, so we did a lot of work on the water budget last year.

1392
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:23,743
[SPEAKER_18]: So I haven't done much this year as far as changing things around.

1393
01:51:24,303 --> 01:51:26,805
[SPEAKER_18]: So the headcount you had, I think is wrong.

1394
01:51:26,825 --> 01:51:27,746
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there's a mistake there.

1395
01:51:28,286 --> 01:51:36,392
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have the deputy, which is new, but that position was in the budget, but it's a new person.

1396
01:51:36,752 --> 01:51:39,234
[SPEAKER_18]: Water quality controller, also a new position, new person.

1397
01:51:39,875 --> 01:51:42,056
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, existing person, but a new position.

1398
01:51:43,447 --> 01:51:44,590
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's going from 2 to 3.

1399
01:51:45,833 --> 01:51:47,697
[SPEAKER_18]: We added a couple of positions in water last year.

1400
01:51:48,519 --> 01:51:50,002
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are those are them.

1401
01:51:50,443 --> 01:51:53,029
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's.

1402
01:51:54,940 --> 01:52:04,148
[SPEAKER_18]: There were some increases there having to do with technology, the way that we test water, the way that we protect ourselves.

1403
01:52:04,168 --> 01:52:05,209
[SPEAKER_18]: We bought some trench gear.

1404
01:52:06,430 --> 01:52:12,715
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we have a flushing contract that we're trying to really get some headway on.

1405
01:52:13,656 --> 01:52:15,277
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're trying to start that actually this summer.

1406
01:52:16,238 --> 01:52:17,859
[SPEAKER_18]: So we added that to the budget last year.

1407
01:52:18,119 --> 01:52:20,401
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think we increased it a little bit this year for field work.

1408
01:52:22,603 --> 01:52:29,217
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, yeah, a lot of the other increases were contractual things that we typically do that just, you know, get more expensive.

1409
01:52:29,978 --> 01:52:33,406
[SPEAKER_18]: And we pay stormwater things out of here too, like catch basin cleaning and things like that, so.

1410
01:52:33,732 --> 01:52:37,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it, just so we can make sure we have the right stuff.

1411
01:52:39,016 --> 01:52:52,806
[SPEAKER_05]: In front of us, I had it in here as plus one deputy commissioner, plus two ME03, minus one assistant water network admin, minus two maintenance crafts, minus one equipment repair, as that sounds like that's not accurate.

1412
01:52:53,207 --> 01:52:54,928
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we need to, I think I need to look at that.

1413
01:52:55,388 --> 01:52:58,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, can you submit to us an updated headcount?

1414
01:52:58,331 --> 01:52:58,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

1415
01:52:58,871 --> 01:52:59,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1416
01:53:01,914 --> 01:53:04,836
[SPEAKER_05]: My only that was my only question was just, uh.

1417
01:53:05,877 --> 01:53:07,578
[SPEAKER_05]: That was I just had a question about that.

1418
01:53:07,699 --> 01:53:11,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, is the deputy commissioner being paid from the water sewer budget or.

1419
01:53:12,830 --> 01:53:13,510
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I believe it is.

1420
01:53:13,530 --> 01:53:14,091
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1421
01:53:14,531 --> 01:53:18,413
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, part of the rate study that we're doing will be indirect costs as well.

1422
01:53:18,853 --> 01:53:22,575
[SPEAKER_18]: So we do calculate indirect costs in the finance department and they figure out what that's going to be.

1423
01:53:23,595 --> 01:53:31,119
[SPEAKER_18]: However, one of the things that we should really take a close look at is based off of

1424
01:53:32,319 --> 01:53:37,981
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, especially the CIP, maybe some future growth in water and how we're gonna tackle that.

1425
01:53:38,921 --> 01:53:40,662
[SPEAKER_18]: That'll, the indirect cost will change as well.

1426
01:53:41,602 --> 01:53:43,342
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're gonna take a look at that as well.

1427
01:53:44,403 --> 01:53:44,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

1428
01:53:46,003 --> 01:53:49,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, any questions from members of the Council on the Water Sewer Enterprise Fund?

1429
01:53:49,204 --> 01:53:49,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan.

1430
01:53:52,525 --> 01:53:57,127
[SPEAKER_02]: So is this the fund out of which we have to repair all of our 120-year-old pipes?

1431
01:53:58,687 --> 01:54:00,048
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, or that or grants.

1432
01:54:03,113 --> 01:54:12,775
[SPEAKER_02]: And I apologize for this newbie question, but where in here am I looking for an increase because we got to start repairing these pipes?

1433
01:54:13,515 --> 01:54:14,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Which budget item?

1434
01:54:15,095 --> 01:54:15,955
[SPEAKER_18]: Not in operating.

1435
01:54:15,975 --> 01:54:21,036
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so eventually I'd like to have things in operating.

1436
01:54:21,076 --> 01:54:23,377
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're taking steps.

1437
01:54:23,417 --> 01:54:24,297
[SPEAKER_18]: Last year we take steps.

1438
01:54:24,317 --> 01:54:27,037
[SPEAKER_18]: We needed another water quality coordinator, so we have that now.

1439
01:54:27,057 --> 01:54:27,697
[SPEAKER_18]: Now we have two.

1440
01:54:28,238 --> 01:54:29,238
[SPEAKER_18]: That was an important step.

1441
01:54:31,458 --> 01:54:34,261
[SPEAKER_18]: This is all in preparation for the regulatory changes.

1442
01:54:34,961 --> 01:54:39,085
[SPEAKER_18]: And new equipment for testing lead, for example, is another thing.

1443
01:54:39,666 --> 01:54:48,814
[SPEAKER_18]: Where you're going to see the planning for replacing pipes and those costs are in capital improvements.

1444
01:54:49,394 --> 01:54:51,356
[SPEAKER_18]: So the CIPs, where you're going to see those.

1445
01:54:54,899 --> 01:55:03,923
[SPEAKER_18]: That is a little bit fuzzy a few years out because we don't necessarily know where we should be focusing our attention.

1446
01:55:04,163 --> 01:55:08,105
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what we're having worked on as part of the rate study.

1447
01:55:08,445 --> 01:55:12,347
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you can't just look at rates, you have to look at what you're going to be spending that money on and why.

1448
01:55:12,967 --> 01:55:15,709
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're starting from a place of how old are our pipes?

1449
01:55:15,749 --> 01:55:18,170
[SPEAKER_18]: How fast do we need to repair them or replace them?

1450
01:55:18,671 --> 01:55:22,233
[SPEAKER_18]: And then what do those costs look like over time?

1451
01:55:22,693 --> 01:55:25,275
[SPEAKER_18]: How do we fund them with debt service?

1452
01:55:25,735 --> 01:55:28,436
[SPEAKER_18]: How do we fund them with grants if they're available?

1453
01:55:28,697 --> 01:55:30,578
[SPEAKER_18]: How do we fund it from just retained earnings?

1454
01:55:30,918 --> 01:55:37,582
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are our sources and putting the pieces together on how to fund it is gonna be,

1455
01:55:39,603 --> 01:55:53,995
[SPEAKER_18]: not something that comes out of the operating budget, unless we're doing in-house relays, which I would eventually like to get there, because contract work is expensive, and if we have the skills in-house, then we can save some money there.

1456
01:55:54,876 --> 01:56:00,860
[SPEAKER_18]: So in other words, having a few people in-house that are dedicated every day to just relaying water pipe.

1457
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:04,431
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, of course, that's a vision, right?

1458
01:56:04,831 --> 01:56:09,274
[SPEAKER_18]: But where we are today is trying to understand the magnitude of the problem.

1459
01:56:09,694 --> 01:56:12,977
[SPEAKER_18]: And then how do we get there over time?

1460
01:56:13,117 --> 01:56:15,478
[SPEAKER_18]: And what does that, you know, what does that framework look like?

1461
01:56:16,599 --> 01:56:19,101
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I hope you don't mind if I just follow up a little bit.

1462
01:56:19,301 --> 01:56:25,445
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to wrap our heads around an issue.

1463
01:56:25,465 --> 01:56:25,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And

1464
01:56:28,117 --> 01:56:43,549
[SPEAKER_02]: You're saying if we had sort of in-house people, which I imagine is because you say it's part of a plan for the future, like that is really how a city would normally be run is you're using this budget to make sure that you maintain all of the lines.

1465
01:56:43,870 --> 01:56:44,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1466
01:56:44,050 --> 01:56:44,790
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there.

1467
01:56:47,247 --> 01:56:53,331
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, should I be looking in this budget for like us at least beginning to do some of that work this year, this fiscal year?

1468
01:56:53,371 --> 01:56:53,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1469
01:56:54,571 --> 01:57:00,295
[SPEAKER_18]: So the maintaining part is a lot of what this budget is doing.

1470
01:57:00,535 --> 01:57:03,617
[SPEAKER_18]: So things like the flushing program, which is in here.

1471
01:57:04,697 --> 01:57:11,021
[SPEAKER_18]: Things like the new water quality controller, even the deputy because of how that works.

1472
01:57:11,161 --> 01:57:15,204
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a supervisor position I'm also trying to fill that we have open right now.

1473
01:57:16,384 --> 01:57:24,146
[SPEAKER_18]: So all of those contribute to the strategy to get to a solution for the big problem, so to speak.

1474
01:57:24,686 --> 01:57:26,986
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's what you can be looking at in the operating.

1475
01:57:28,126 --> 01:57:36,828
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, of course, people, staff can also do relay work, but we don't have the capacity to have a crew every day doing relay.

1476
01:57:37,168 --> 01:57:41,669
[SPEAKER_18]: We actually tried it on, what's the name, was it?

1477
01:57:42,589 --> 01:57:43,070
[SPEAKER_18]: Was it Union?

1478
01:57:43,570 --> 01:57:44,070
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, Union.

1479
01:57:44,371 --> 01:57:46,312
[SPEAKER_18]: We tried it on Union Street, that's right.

1480
01:57:46,553 --> 01:57:47,373
[SPEAKER_18]: And it worked out great.

1481
01:57:47,533 --> 01:57:48,995
[SPEAKER_18]: We do have the skill sets, we can do it.

1482
01:57:49,735 --> 01:57:54,439
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm trying to model, you know, the vision based off of that.

1483
01:57:54,980 --> 01:57:57,562
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of times the cities don't have the skill set to do that.

1484
01:57:57,802 --> 01:57:58,403
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we do.

1485
01:57:59,243 --> 01:58:01,926
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not necessarily hard work and it can be, it can be trained.

1486
01:58:02,666 --> 01:58:04,887
[SPEAKER_18]: But with that said, that's not going to solve the problem.

1487
01:58:05,167 --> 01:58:11,370
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be a combination of in-house and contract work over quite a long span of time.

1488
01:58:12,030 --> 01:58:16,212
[SPEAKER_18]: Just to give you some numbers that we're talking about today, we're talking about like a 35-year plan.

1489
01:58:16,712 --> 01:58:18,933
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are the numbers that we're talking about here.

1490
01:58:18,953 --> 01:58:25,175
[SPEAKER_18]: A couple of miles, two to three miles of pipe replacements every year, some of that is contract work, some of that is in-house work.

1491
01:58:27,253 --> 01:58:28,534
[SPEAKER_18]: So hopefully that answers your question.

1492
01:58:28,914 --> 01:58:32,676
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my final question, I think, is about retained earnings.

1493
01:58:32,776 --> 01:58:35,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Retained earnings, by that, do you mean what enters

1494
01:58:39,994 --> 01:58:50,984
[SPEAKER_02]: the enterprise fund from the rates that is not spent in that fiscal year, that that should be something that we are, you know, sort of filling that bucket year by year.

1495
01:58:51,004 --> 01:58:55,128
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that something I can see here?

1496
01:58:55,208 --> 01:58:56,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is this really just a budget?

1497
01:58:56,469 --> 01:58:58,872
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not seeing sort of what is being retained?

1498
01:58:59,511 --> 01:59:02,233
[SPEAKER_18]: You can bring that question up with a finance director.

1499
01:59:02,253 --> 01:59:03,214
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure.

1500
01:59:03,555 --> 01:59:07,478
[SPEAKER_18]: So when the retained earnings are certified, then we know what that balance is.

1501
01:59:08,599 --> 01:59:11,642
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think the last time was $8 million or something like that.

1502
01:59:12,142 --> 01:59:13,003
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to go up.

1503
01:59:13,944 --> 01:59:16,966
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the reasons why it is what it is and it's kind of going up is because

1504
01:59:17,947 --> 01:59:20,749
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't necessarily know what the healthy number should be.

1505
01:59:20,969 --> 01:59:22,810
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's actually also going to be a part of the rate study.

1506
01:59:23,230 --> 01:59:31,135
[SPEAKER_18]: So we should be keeping retained earnings at a specific balance or hovering around a specific balance all the time.

1507
01:59:31,756 --> 01:59:34,978
[SPEAKER_18]: But right now, we don't actually have enough information to know what that number should be.

1508
01:59:36,059 --> 01:59:38,662
[SPEAKER_18]: And what it should be next year and the year after and the year after the year after.

1509
01:59:39,002 --> 01:59:40,224
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's going to be part of the study.

1510
01:59:41,726 --> 01:59:49,956
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure I don't I can't speak for Bob but I would imagine that the certified funds, you know, are available at some point in the process of the budget process.

1511
01:59:51,798 --> 02:00:01,141
[SPEAKER_18]: And we use retained earnings for, you know, we can use it for debt service for like, for example, that three and a half million dollar loan that we took out for the Willis Avenue water main replacement.

1512
02:00:01,562 --> 02:00:05,003
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, that debt service is paid out of the retained earnings, I believe.

1513
02:00:05,063 --> 02:00:09,444
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't wanna speak for Bob again, but like, you know, it's worked into the enterprise fund or retained earnings or something like that.

1514
02:00:10,485 --> 02:00:15,106
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, you know, we're planning on buying some vehicles, for example, out of the retained earnings.

1515
02:00:16,727 --> 02:00:28,791
[SPEAKER_18]: which is, you know, when you're talking about eight or nine or $10 million account, you know, half a million dollars worth of vehicles is, is, is significant, but not not not a drop in the bucket, but, you know, significant thing.

1516
02:00:29,691 --> 02:00:31,252
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's not we can't just

1517
02:00:33,362 --> 02:00:39,445
[SPEAKER_18]: dip into retained earnings to go replace all of our pipes out there, because we need to have that healthy number in there.

1518
02:00:40,486 --> 02:00:40,866
[SPEAKER_18]: What is it?

1519
02:00:40,926 --> 02:00:41,666
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it 5 million?

1520
02:00:41,706 --> 02:00:42,227
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it 6 million?

1521
02:00:42,467 --> 02:00:42,947
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll find out.

1522
02:00:43,867 --> 02:00:47,229
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we'll maintain that and we'll know what it should be every single year.

1523
02:00:47,489 --> 02:00:56,514
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, we'll work with Bob's office to, we're all consultant, we'll give us information and we'll work with Bob's office to figure out, you know, how to do that over time.

1524
02:00:58,646 --> 02:00:59,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

1525
02:00:59,266 --> 02:01:04,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Commissioner, are we, and Director Dickinson may have the answer as well.

1526
02:01:05,051 --> 02:01:09,014
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not budgeting for a surplus of retained earnings in the enterprise account, correct?

1527
02:01:09,875 --> 02:01:13,497
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not expecting more revenue than we are planning for in expenses?

1528
02:01:14,658 --> 02:01:15,859
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we're not in the general fund.

1529
02:01:16,159 --> 02:01:17,921
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there's typically a surplus.

1530
02:01:18,261 --> 02:01:22,324
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's usually because expenses were not made, right?

1531
02:01:22,344 --> 02:01:23,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we're not saying we're budgeting 27,

1532
02:01:25,148 --> 02:01:30,092
[SPEAKER_05]: point for 27 million in revenue, but we're only going to spend 26.5, right?

1533
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:32,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see what you're saying.

1534
02:01:32,694 --> 02:01:33,274
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't do that.

1535
02:01:34,275 --> 02:01:44,022
[SPEAKER_08]: No, retained earnings would come from turnbacks, basically, expense accounts, or additional revenue coming in.

1536
02:01:44,502 --> 02:01:44,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1537
02:01:45,303 --> 02:01:48,405
[SPEAKER_05]: But the budget, it's a balanced budget for the enterprise.

1538
02:01:48,485 --> 02:01:53,329
[SPEAKER_08]: But usually people don't spend to the end of their actual available budget.

1539
02:01:54,376 --> 02:01:59,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, and if they did, we'd have to do budget transfers when they went over.

1540
02:01:59,539 --> 02:02:05,902
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of revenue, people use more water, we get more revenue.

1541
02:02:07,403 --> 02:02:09,024
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how it works.

1542
02:02:09,384 --> 02:02:14,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever's left over at the end adds to what we had at the end of last year, and that's

1543
02:02:15,543 --> 02:02:17,064
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where your retained earnings come from.

1544
02:02:17,464 --> 02:02:17,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1545
02:02:18,024 --> 02:02:26,709
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just wanted to put that out there just to note that both additional money going to free cash reserves in the general fund or additional money going to retained earnings.

1546
02:02:27,349 --> 02:02:29,470
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that we're budgeting to raise more money than we spend.

1547
02:02:29,530 --> 02:02:32,211
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that we're either spending less or raising more than we expect.

1548
02:02:33,272 --> 02:02:33,452
Great.

1549
02:02:33,592 --> 02:02:34,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you both.

1550
02:02:35,873 --> 02:02:39,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further questions on the water sewer enterprise fund from members of the council?

1551
02:02:42,443 --> 02:02:45,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions or comments from members of the public, either in person or on Zoom?

1552
02:02:47,645 --> 02:02:54,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, I just wanted to note that if there are significant changes to any of the divisions, we may have you back after the budget proposal goes out.

1553
02:02:54,888 --> 02:02:57,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that we're expecting them, but who knows?

1554
02:02:59,190 --> 02:03:03,572
[SPEAKER_05]: So just because it's a new process and you're here earlier than normal, we appreciate it.

1555
02:03:03,592 --> 02:03:04,372
[SPEAKER_18]: Not a problem.

1556
02:03:04,392 --> 02:03:05,112
[SPEAKER_18]: You know where I work.

1557
02:03:08,814 --> 02:03:09,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Tim.

1558
02:03:09,434 --> 02:03:10,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everybody.

1559
02:03:10,375 --> 02:03:10,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Owen.

1560
02:03:17,672 --> 02:03:30,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Next we have right on topic debt service bonds and interest Yes, so this is one of the places we have two numbers we have our general fund debt service and our water and sewer fund debt service and

1561
02:03:32,199 --> 02:03:34,102
[SPEAKER_05]: General Fund Debt Service budgeted fiscal 24 $5,090,533.77.

1562
02:03:34,722 --> 02:03:36,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiscal 25 proposed $5,391,318.49 for about an increase of $300,000.

1563
02:03:47,501 --> 02:03:50,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Water and sewer fund debt service fiscal 24 budgeted $1,273,968 and fiscal 25 proposed $1,743,643.75 for an increase of about $500,000.

1564
02:04:05,908 --> 02:04:09,390
[SPEAKER_05]: The total debt service increasing about $800,000.

1565
02:04:10,050 --> 02:04:14,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, $500,000 from water sewer fund and $300,000 from our general fund.

1566
02:04:15,093 --> 02:04:18,194
[SPEAKER_05]: And it also looks like most of that is increased principal payments.

1567
02:04:18,874 --> 02:04:20,955
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will turn it over to Director Dickinson.

1568
02:04:22,596 --> 02:04:23,437
[SPEAKER_08]: It's debt service.

1569
02:04:23,697 --> 02:04:24,477
[SPEAKER_08]: We borrowed the money.

1570
02:04:24,697 --> 02:04:25,618
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to pay them back.

1571
02:04:27,018 --> 02:04:29,479
[SPEAKER_08]: The only additional thing there is

1572
02:04:31,806 --> 02:04:33,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of it's long-term debt service.

1573
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:43,197
[SPEAKER_08]: There's $60,000 in there for the $1.5 million that we barge for term for the fire station planning.

1574
02:04:44,438 --> 02:04:47,601
[SPEAKER_08]: But beyond that, it's all out there.

1575
02:04:47,661 --> 02:04:49,643
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all in the statement of indebtedness.

1576
02:04:49,883 --> 02:04:50,604
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we owe.

1577
02:04:50,624 --> 02:04:51,605
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we have to pay.

1578
02:04:51,845 --> 02:04:55,869
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's relatively boring.

1579
02:04:56,727 --> 02:05:02,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this keeping the debt service amounts about at the percent target for the budget that you guys set?

1580
02:05:03,553 --> 02:05:04,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it 3% or 5%?

1581
02:05:04,373 --> 02:05:05,534
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't quite remember.

1582
02:05:08,837 --> 02:05:13,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I don't know where we are with that.

1583
02:05:22,488 --> 02:05:26,291
[SPEAKER_08]: The city right now doesn't have a great deal of debt in general.

1584
02:05:28,675 --> 02:05:38,941
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd say that $5.3 million out of $100 million, it's very low compared to the total budget for the city.

1585
02:05:54,707 --> 02:06:05,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the Collins Center presentation on the capital improvement plan that the goal was to get us to a certain target percentage to increase bond capacity at some point.

1586
02:06:06,534 --> 02:06:10,216
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could just let us know kind of where this puts us on that track, on that target.

1587
02:06:10,296 --> 02:06:14,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was all the way up through fiscal 29, if I remember correctly.

1588
02:06:14,078 --> 02:06:14,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1589
02:06:14,658 --> 02:06:16,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, obviously

1590
02:06:17,435 --> 02:06:23,118
[SPEAKER_08]: But obviously, debt's coming off in the next few years, which is great.

1591
02:06:23,558 --> 02:06:35,565
[SPEAKER_08]: And the less the general fund has to borrow, obviously, there's going to be some other major expenditures in the next few years that will be debt funded.

1592
02:06:35,805 --> 02:06:42,109
[SPEAKER_08]: The fire station, we're planning for the fire station, but you're going to have to pay for it.

1593
02:06:42,149 --> 02:06:42,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1594
02:06:44,801 --> 02:06:45,321
[SPEAKER_05]: understood.

1595
02:06:45,522 --> 02:06:52,186
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if we were to do a debt exclusion for major capital project, that means that it wouldn't come out of the general fund debt service, correct?

1596
02:06:54,462 --> 02:07:00,647
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it would come out of the General Fund Debt Service, but it would be financed by a Prop 2.5 exclusion.

1597
02:07:01,087 --> 02:07:01,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1598
02:07:01,688 --> 02:07:05,651
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would just, on the tax recap, it's Form DE-1.

1599
02:07:05,771 --> 02:07:18,622
[SPEAKER_08]: You just put in how much that is, and that gets raised additionally to what you raised in appropriate, because it's beyond the balance of Prop 2.5 until you've paid off that debt.

1600
02:07:19,358 --> 02:07:20,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, OK.

1601
02:07:20,658 --> 02:07:28,280
[SPEAKER_05]: But that would potentially allow us to plan for other uses for the capital that may have gone to the fire station.

1602
02:07:28,861 --> 02:07:29,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1603
02:07:29,701 --> 02:07:29,901
Great.

1604
02:07:31,541 --> 02:07:36,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions from members of the council on the debt service bonds and interest budget?

1605
02:07:38,703 --> 02:07:43,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, any questions from members of the public on the debt service bonds and interest budget?

1606
02:07:46,566 --> 02:07:48,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, thank you, Director Dickinson.

1607
02:07:53,649 --> 02:07:54,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Electrical department.

1608
02:07:55,890 --> 02:07:57,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw Mr. Randazzo earlier.

1609
02:07:57,310 --> 02:08:00,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm guessing he went to do better things.

1610
02:08:06,293 --> 02:08:07,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

1611
02:08:08,814 --> 02:08:10,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, elections, give me one second.

1612
02:08:11,115 --> 02:08:13,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I may have just, I put elections in the wrong place.

1613
02:08:13,616 --> 02:08:13,996
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

1614
02:08:16,097 --> 02:08:18,837
[SPEAKER_11]: The words are pretty similar to be fair.

1615
02:08:19,838 --> 02:08:20,538
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no.

1616
02:08:20,618 --> 02:08:22,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw him here diligently waiting and he is,

1617
02:08:24,705 --> 02:08:27,909
[SPEAKER_05]: always at the beck and call I think of all of us.

1618
02:08:30,612 --> 02:08:31,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's back.

1619
02:08:36,206 --> 02:08:36,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that all right?

1620
02:08:37,067 --> 02:08:37,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, Steve.

1621
02:08:38,028 --> 02:08:38,789
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take you, Steve.

1622
02:08:39,330 --> 02:08:41,052
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw you running, so you get to go.

1623
02:08:42,293 --> 02:08:45,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone who runs into this room.

1624
02:08:45,457 --> 02:08:47,460
[SPEAKER_00]: I was expected to be a couple more on the list.

1625
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:48,461
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.

1626
02:08:48,521 --> 02:08:49,843
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's my fault, actually.

1627
02:08:49,883 --> 02:08:52,065
[SPEAKER_05]: I had it out of order, so that's on me.

1628
02:08:52,726 --> 02:08:53,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, council.

1629
02:08:53,747 --> 02:08:54,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.

1630
02:08:55,109 --> 02:08:56,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, Mr. Superintendent.

1631
02:08:56,450 --> 02:08:57,491
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great to have you here.

1632
02:08:58,872 --> 02:09:00,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for all the work that you do.

1633
02:09:00,474 --> 02:09:01,575
[SPEAKER_05]: We know how important it is.

1634
02:09:03,136 --> 02:09:08,621
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just going to quickly go through the budget for the electrical department.

1635
02:09:09,142 --> 02:09:10,943
[SPEAKER_05]: We have fiscal 24, 644,100.

1636
02:09:11,544 --> 02:09:12,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiscal 25, the new budget at 678,804.84.

1637
02:09:19,895 --> 02:09:21,236
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an increase of $34,704.84.

1638
02:09:21,377 --> 02:09:34,951
[SPEAKER_05]: The salaries raises coming from the contract and 2% non-union, some fixed cost increases and increases to vacation time and sick time.

1639
02:09:35,903 --> 02:09:43,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Some increases in electrical costs that we're paying more for our streetlights and some increase in some meter charges as well, but it's all fixed costs going up.

1640
02:09:44,825 --> 02:09:49,847
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, we'd love to hear from you about what you've been doing this year, your plans for next year.

1641
02:09:50,487 --> 02:09:57,629
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I had some medical issues this year and I was unfortunately not around for a lot of it, but I did the best while I was around.

1642
02:09:58,589 --> 02:10:12,175
[SPEAKER_00]: We're continuing to try to make upgrades to some of our pedestrian crossings, make them more ADA compliant, help the hearing impaired and so forth.

1643
02:10:12,255 --> 02:10:13,455
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working on that.

1644
02:10:15,436 --> 02:10:19,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much it's not an exciting department to really speak of.

1645
02:10:20,138 --> 02:10:23,839
[SPEAKER_00]: It's generally things break, traffic signals, street lights.

1646
02:10:23,919 --> 02:10:28,561
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the best I can to get those repairs taken care of.

1647
02:10:28,661 --> 02:10:34,364
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, sometimes it's not as easy as others, but I do try wherever I can.

1648
02:10:34,924 --> 02:10:36,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we think you're electrified.

1649
02:10:36,685 --> 02:10:37,005
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1650
02:10:40,473 --> 02:10:42,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Any big plans for the upcoming year?

1651
02:10:42,954 --> 02:10:44,034
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue the same.

1652
02:10:44,694 --> 02:10:50,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to make any upgrades as possible as funds allow.

1653
02:10:51,275 --> 02:10:58,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue to take an opportunity to upgrade lighting to LED, which is kind of a no-brainer in this day and age.

1654
02:10:59,497 --> 02:11:01,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Saves on maintenance, saves on power.

1655
02:11:01,998 --> 02:11:03,978
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a win-win for everyone.

1656
02:11:03,998 --> 02:11:07,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just pretty much keep the same.

1657
02:11:08,579 --> 02:11:11,422
[SPEAKER_00]: keep trucking along and hopefully keep the residents happy.

1658
02:11:12,122 --> 02:11:12,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.

1659
02:11:13,524 --> 02:11:17,007
[SPEAKER_05]: On the switch to LED, how many of our lights would you say are LED at this point?

1660
02:11:17,668 --> 02:11:24,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Street lights are roughly around 5,600 street lights that they've all been upgraded to LED.

1661
02:11:25,575 --> 02:11:31,461
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not including probably 130 of the decorative style that are throughout our squares.

1662
02:11:33,903 --> 02:11:38,404
[SPEAKER_00]: The school department on their properties, I know that Freedom Way is being addressed.

1663
02:11:38,945 --> 02:11:41,945
[SPEAKER_00]: That's obviously a concern, and I understand.

1664
02:11:42,786 --> 02:11:54,729
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mainly maintain the streets and stuff like that, and just try to assist any department, you know, such as the schools, if they're interested.

1665
02:11:54,889 --> 02:12:03,292
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of input also is given from Alicia Hunt, who does a great job with, you know, solidifying funds and stuff like that.

1666
02:12:03,749 --> 02:12:03,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1667
02:12:04,169 --> 02:12:10,594
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on the on the traffic signals, do we have any that are really old that need to be replaced?

1668
02:12:11,114 --> 02:12:19,000
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have some that are inundated, like, for instance, Boston Ave and Winthrop Street.

1669
02:12:19,060 --> 02:12:20,841
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of our oldest.

1670
02:12:20,881 --> 02:12:22,543
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also Arlington

1671
02:12:23,924 --> 02:12:26,467
[SPEAKER_00]: and Boston have that intersection as well.

1672
02:12:26,567 --> 02:12:28,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a couple of our oldest.

1673
02:12:29,611 --> 02:12:36,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Central Avenue in Spring is one that has a lot of deficiencies, but that is kind of beyond my scope.

1674
02:12:38,382 --> 02:12:46,808
[SPEAKER_00]: Todd from the traffic engineer has been assisting with that, and I kind of lean to him for his guidance because that's kind of his expertise.

1675
02:12:47,268 --> 02:12:55,033
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more of when a vehicle knocks down something, you know, we go and make sure it gets put back up and stuff like that.

1676
02:12:55,113 --> 02:12:55,273
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

1677
02:12:56,034 --> 02:12:56,254
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1678
02:12:56,394 --> 02:12:58,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions for Superintendent Randazzo?

1679
02:12:59,156 --> 02:13:00,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Collins?

1680
02:13:00,297 --> 02:13:00,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1681
02:13:00,837 --> 02:13:01,417
[SPEAKER_17]: Not a question.

1682
02:13:01,458 --> 02:13:06,481
[SPEAKER_17]: Appreciate this very straightforward budget, but just thanks for the work that you do year round, obviously.

1683
02:13:07,282 --> 02:13:10,925
[SPEAKER_17]: lighting is really important to residents when they're walking around driving.

1684
02:13:11,025 --> 02:13:13,427
[SPEAKER_17]: So we see the fruits of your hard work every day.

1685
02:13:13,507 --> 02:13:13,787
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1686
02:13:14,127 --> 02:13:14,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1687
02:13:15,068 --> 02:13:15,308
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1688
02:13:15,588 --> 02:13:16,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions?

1689
02:13:17,570 --> 02:13:20,272
[SPEAKER_05]: We are very lucky to have you and grateful for your work.

1690
02:13:20,412 --> 02:13:26,757
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, I'm just going to see if there's anyone from the public who would like to ask a question.

1691
02:13:28,478 --> 02:13:29,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none.

1692
02:13:29,198 --> 02:13:29,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

1693
02:13:29,799 --> 02:13:30,199
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1694
02:13:30,319 --> 02:13:30,940
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.

1695
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:31,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good evening.

1696
02:13:32,140 --> 02:13:32,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1697
02:13:36,308 --> 02:13:39,490
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, elections, sorry for that, it's my bad.

1698
02:13:40,991 --> 02:13:44,394
[SPEAKER_05]: And early in your tenure, I apologize for that as well.

1699
02:13:44,414 --> 02:13:49,638
[SPEAKER_05]: We have our new elections manager and the chief of staff here.

1700
02:13:49,658 --> 02:13:51,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we in week two?

1701
02:13:52,339 --> 02:13:52,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1702
02:13:52,780 --> 02:13:56,863
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so I'm sure you got it all handled, you know every detail.

1703
02:13:59,782 --> 02:14:02,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to thank you for being here.

1704
02:14:03,224 --> 02:14:13,390
[SPEAKER_05]: We have had, you know, we, this council voted a couple years ago to shift to this model of an independent elections department under an elections commission, and we've been working with the administration around that.

1705
02:14:13,810 --> 02:14:19,974
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had some great points of agreement, some points of disagreement, but we are, you know, we are really grateful.

1706
02:14:20,094 --> 02:14:23,636
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we had some conversations earlier to be like, let's call it elections department.

1707
02:14:24,216 --> 02:14:29,724
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great thing to make it clear that the commission is just overseeing and you guys are the elections department.

1708
02:14:30,765 --> 02:14:32,868
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but yeah, I just wanted to give some of that context.

1709
02:14:33,809 --> 02:14:40,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure, you know, it's a pretty new department independent, although served many years with this clerk and others as the registrar voters.

1710
02:14:42,270 --> 02:14:55,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to read through quickly basically the budget summary, then we'd love to hear so far from, and also wanna thank Chief of Staff Nazarian, who has been running elections for a little bit now.

1711
02:14:57,540 --> 02:15:11,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Just go through the budget, hear from both of you about what's been happening in fiscal 24, your plans for fiscal 25, anything you think this department needs that wasn't able to get into this budget, but maybe need in the future, and then we'll go to questions from members of the council.

1712
02:15:12,730 --> 02:15:13,991
[SPEAKER_05]: So fiscal 24 budget, $340,196.

1713
02:15:14,051 --> 02:15:14,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiscal 25 budget, $328,629.20.

1714
02:15:14,691 --> 02:15:15,291
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a decrease of about 3%, $11,566.80.

1715
02:15:15,351 --> 02:15:17,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Decrease is caused by having one fewer election in 2025, fiscal 25 than fiscal 24.

1716
02:15:17,673 --> 02:15:19,753
[SPEAKER_05]: So the salary line for seasonal and overtime seems to be reduced.

1717
02:15:38,476 --> 02:15:47,645
[SPEAKER_05]: excuse me, reduced, and also this decreases offset by increases from the contract and ordinary expenses due to inflation around fixed costs.

1718
02:15:47,965 --> 02:15:55,853
[SPEAKER_05]: The headcount is remaining three, I believe that's two full-time, one part-time, and that's staying the same over the two fiscal years.

1719
02:15:55,913 --> 02:15:58,776
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, I'll turn it over to both of you.

1720
02:16:00,446 --> 02:16:04,309
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll begin, and it's my distinct pleasure to introduce Danielle Petrantonio.

1721
02:16:05,130 --> 02:16:08,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Normally I get her last name wrong, so I'm delighted that I got it right this time.

1722
02:16:10,137 --> 02:16:13,179
[SPEAKER_14]: Danielle has been working in the field of elections for the past eight years.

1723
02:16:13,600 --> 02:16:17,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Danielle was most recently the director of elections in the city of Everett.

1724
02:16:18,443 --> 02:16:30,333
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, in addition to that, Danielle actually supported the city of Medford through the March 5th presidential primary, along with her counterpart, the city clerk and chair of the Elections Commission, Sergio Cornelio.

1725
02:16:30,773 --> 02:16:38,799
[SPEAKER_14]: So we were very, very fortunate that we were able to make this connection through attorney Lauren Goldberg from KP Law, who

1726
02:16:40,641 --> 02:16:47,047
[SPEAKER_14]: found us some help and they found Danielle and they found Sergio and they assisted us.

1727
02:16:48,668 --> 02:16:54,474
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we probably called them at least once a day throughout that election once we finally made that contact and

1728
02:16:55,959 --> 02:17:02,062
[SPEAKER_14]: So Danielle had actually worked for us as a consultant, and that was incredibly helpful.

1729
02:17:02,582 --> 02:17:10,405
[SPEAKER_14]: If it wasn't for Danielle, Sergio, and I've said this before in front of this council, but there were a lot of critical team members that allowed us to be successful in that election.

1730
02:17:11,486 --> 02:17:23,130
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just there to make sure that we paved the path to make sure that the other team members were successful, but the people who did all the work were Joan Lamone, as you may know her as Babe,

1731
02:17:24,671 --> 02:17:31,373
[SPEAKER_14]: Then Jan Joyce, she was our former head clerk in the office who came back and supported us throughout.

1732
02:17:31,693 --> 02:17:42,956
[SPEAKER_14]: There were a number of other individuals that are called the A-Team, Advanced Team, as they've been named by our election commission chair in the past.

1733
02:17:43,116 --> 02:17:48,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Which brings me to our election commission and the chair of our election commission, Henry Malorin, who obviously

1734
02:17:49,917 --> 02:17:55,600
[SPEAKER_14]: did a lot of heavy lifting throughout that election to make sure that, you know, I knew what was next.

1735
02:17:56,220 --> 02:18:02,762
[SPEAKER_14]: He put only as much as I needed in front of me to be able to handle what was next, and he was really methodical about that.

1736
02:18:03,422 --> 02:18:09,985
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm, you know, forever appreciative of the extra care and attention that he and

1737
02:18:10,645 --> 02:18:14,286
[SPEAKER_14]: especially Joan Lamone, put towards this past election.

1738
02:18:14,326 --> 02:18:32,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Without them and without the help of the City of Everett staff, who we now have somehow convinced to come here, because, you know, I think Danielle will tell you she enjoyed the work environment, she enjoyed the staff, the A-team, and I'll let her speak to that.

1739
02:18:33,691 --> 02:18:42,979
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm really happy that Danielle's joined our team, and that's the long and short of how we got to where we are and how Danielle's joined our team.

1740
02:18:43,859 --> 02:18:47,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm certainly interested to hear what you think is a more contentious electoral environment.

1741
02:18:48,863 --> 02:18:53,967
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see after the first election here.

1742
02:18:54,027 --> 02:18:54,948
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the right answer.

1743
02:19:01,278 --> 02:19:09,324
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll just, the way we've structured this, considering the fact that Danielle is on her second week, you know, I'm going to go through the budget.

1744
02:19:09,344 --> 02:19:17,791
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to go through the goals and, you know, obviously welcome Danielle to make any additional comments or additional points that she'd like to add.

1745
02:19:18,572 --> 02:19:23,276
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, either one of us may be answering your questions if you have any as we get through this budget.

1746
02:19:23,696 --> 02:19:23,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

1747
02:19:25,632 --> 02:19:30,364
[SPEAKER_14]: So as was already stated, this is a decrease over last year's budget.

1748
02:19:30,464 --> 02:19:34,113
[SPEAKER_14]: It's in terms of the bottom line, and that is because the number of elections we have.

1749
02:19:36,229 --> 02:19:41,792
[SPEAKER_14]: And in general, we do recognize that the complexity of this coming election is greater.

1750
02:19:41,992 --> 02:19:43,853
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've taken that into account to the budget.

1751
02:19:43,893 --> 02:19:54,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise, it might have been a larger decrease than you're seeing, because we do recognize that there's a federal election, and it's going to bring out a lot more voters than we have on a year-to-year basis.

1752
02:19:54,178 --> 02:19:57,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Federal elections inherently bring out the most voters, obviously.

1753
02:19:59,795 --> 02:20:11,383
[SPEAKER_14]: So just going through our budget narrative, essentially, the department continued to work in the basement storage area, isolating elections matters into their own dedicated and secured room.

1754
02:20:11,583 --> 02:20:16,987
[SPEAKER_14]: And before that, the election space was co-shared with the city clerk's office.

1755
02:20:17,367 --> 02:20:29,375
[SPEAKER_14]: I do want to send my specific thanks to our city clerk who turned around on the drop of a dime as I was taking on the role and responsibility and allowed us to separate his

1756
02:20:29,895 --> 02:20:30,616
[SPEAKER_14]: that we were able to bring.

1757
02:20:30,636 --> 02:20:32,917
[SPEAKER_14]: City clerk items into the vault.

1758
02:20:33,037 --> 02:20:42,583
[SPEAKER_14]: So city clerk and elections items or were completely segregated at one point because we just had such a sheer volume of ballots coming in at that point, and we wanted to

1759
02:20:45,131 --> 02:20:47,652
[SPEAKER_14]: the place to put people and organize.

1760
02:20:49,172 --> 02:20:52,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Really, we were in a situation where we knew we didn't have an elections manager.

1761
02:20:53,494 --> 02:20:57,995
[SPEAKER_14]: The office didn't have the other part-time position filled, and we're still working through that.

1762
02:20:59,596 --> 02:21:07,619
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were really wanting to make sure we had, for lack of better terms, and no pun intended, really, the path cleared so we could

1763
02:21:08,620 --> 02:21:14,169
[SPEAKER_14]: spread out, do what we needed to do in an organized manner, and have as few irregularities as possible.

1764
02:21:14,810 --> 02:21:16,733
[SPEAKER_14]: So really appreciate that, Adam.

1765
02:21:17,034 --> 02:21:19,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, I really, really appreciate that.

1766
02:21:22,267 --> 02:21:25,768
[SPEAKER_14]: We provided election worker training and manuals in March of 2024.

1767
02:21:25,929 --> 02:21:43,796
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really interesting because I think it was probably my, after one week of, post the resignation of our former elections manager, after one week of searching far and wide to try to find a temporary elections manager to serve the city of Medford and finding wheat

1768
02:21:44,861 --> 02:21:55,490
[SPEAKER_14]: There were no individuals out there who were either willing or had the necessary experience that was needed because there were so many changes in the Votes Act of 2020.

1769
02:21:59,508 --> 02:22:02,229
[SPEAKER_14]: It made the work dramatically complex.

1770
02:22:02,269 --> 02:22:06,712
[SPEAKER_14]: As I've said to other folks before, I don't consider myself any type of expert in elections.

1771
02:22:07,412 --> 02:22:12,295
[SPEAKER_14]: I will say I probably know 25% of elections, so Danielle will correct me if I get anything wrong here.

1772
02:22:12,335 --> 02:22:15,556
[SPEAKER_14]: But from what I understand, it's dramatically changed things.

1773
02:22:15,576 --> 02:22:19,258
[SPEAKER_14]: We also had another consultant who helped me with a lot of office work.

1774
02:22:20,239 --> 02:22:22,900
[SPEAKER_14]: That consultant was the former town clerk of Westminster.

1775
02:22:23,360 --> 02:22:27,584
[SPEAKER_14]: But she didn't have any experience with vote by mail or early voting.

1776
02:22:27,684 --> 02:22:29,646
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had to continue to kind of supplement.

1777
02:22:30,046 --> 02:22:41,095
[SPEAKER_14]: Getting back to my prior point, after a week of searching far and wide, we emailed listserv after we put feelers out, after feeler out, after feeler out.

1778
02:22:41,115 --> 02:22:44,338
[SPEAKER_14]: And I kind of got to a point where I realized we weren't going to get there.

1779
02:22:45,279 --> 02:22:47,941
[SPEAKER_14]: Then I kind of accepted that this is something I'm going to have to do.

1780
02:22:48,081 --> 02:22:49,943
[SPEAKER_14]: And working with Commissioner Malorin,

1781
02:22:52,268 --> 02:22:58,413
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the first things we had was, I remember distinctly, someone telling me, well, we have a training in a couple of days for our inspectors.

1782
02:23:00,034 --> 02:23:02,376
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't do a training in a couple of days for our inspectors.

1783
02:23:02,416 --> 02:23:03,677
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not going to work.

1784
02:23:03,697 --> 02:23:04,298
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not prepared.

1785
02:23:04,318 --> 02:23:05,379
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know who's going to do the training.

1786
02:23:05,439 --> 02:23:06,179
[SPEAKER_14]: It's certainly not me.

1787
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:08,241
[SPEAKER_14]: These inspectors are going to know more than me.

1788
02:23:09,082 --> 02:23:10,463
[SPEAKER_14]: So we did cancel the first training.

1789
02:23:10,783 --> 02:23:14,066
[SPEAKER_14]: And right around that time, we found Danielle and Sergio.

1790
02:23:14,246 --> 02:23:18,670
[SPEAKER_14]: And they actually came in, and they did our training, which was a subsequent week later.

1791
02:23:18,950 --> 02:23:21,071
[SPEAKER_14]: We rescheduled that training, and everything went.

1792
02:23:22,421 --> 02:23:24,041
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, and everything went very well.

1793
02:23:24,101 --> 02:23:35,744
[SPEAKER_14]: And so Danielle and Sergio, her counterpart, actually updated a lot of our information, and I'm sure, you know, Danielle will take it from where she left it off the last time she worked on it, candidly.

1794
02:23:37,564 --> 02:23:44,606
[SPEAKER_14]: As the Council knows, the Elections Commission and Department instituted a model of transparency.

1795
02:23:44,906 --> 02:23:45,326
[SPEAKER_14]: This was

1796
02:23:46,052 --> 02:23:52,618
[SPEAKER_14]: based on, frankly, comments that were made by the city council as to issues and concerns that came up in past elections.

1797
02:23:52,878 --> 02:23:54,760
[SPEAKER_14]: And we felt it was important.

1798
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:56,541
[SPEAKER_14]: The mayor was obviously supportive.

1799
02:23:57,142 --> 02:23:58,363
[SPEAKER_14]: The commission was supportive.

1800
02:23:58,703 --> 02:24:03,207
[SPEAKER_14]: We felt it important to write up when there were major irregularities in the process.

1801
02:24:03,247 --> 02:24:04,669
[SPEAKER_14]: The council received two reports.

1802
02:24:05,149 --> 02:24:06,150
[SPEAKER_14]: that we're going to be looking at.

1803
02:24:06,170 --> 02:24:06,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Those two reports.

1804
02:24:06,610 --> 02:24:10,594
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe if not one or both might be in the council's packets.

1805
02:24:10,654 --> 02:24:14,977
[SPEAKER_14]: So you know, you've done your your portion of that transparency, and we appreciate that.

1806
02:24:15,918 --> 02:24:19,961
[SPEAKER_14]: I've of course, handed those reports to Danielle, so she has that information as well.

1807
02:24:20,422 --> 02:24:22,223
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know, Danielle has asked.

1808
02:24:22,323 --> 02:24:24,645
[SPEAKER_14]: What is that section of the budget narrative mean?

1809
02:24:24,685 --> 02:24:27,247
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've explained that that's the expectation moving forward.

1810
02:24:27,928 --> 02:24:28,168
[SPEAKER_14]: So she

1811
02:24:34,505 --> 02:24:37,646
[SPEAKER_14]: continue to share anytime there's something reportable.

1812
02:24:39,327 --> 02:24:46,730
[SPEAKER_14]: As far as goals for fiscal 25, these are, you know, the ones largely that I was able to jot down.

1813
02:24:46,770 --> 02:24:51,613
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't apply a lot of pressure to Danielle to try to give us others, so maybe more to come.

1814
02:24:52,313 --> 02:24:52,953
[SPEAKER_14]: But for now, we

1815
02:24:55,174 --> 02:25:02,285
[SPEAKER_14]: are going to continue to work to recruit and train additional election workers to ensure that we have enough people to backfill for elections.

1816
02:25:02,986 --> 02:25:10,938
[SPEAKER_14]: We are also presently reviewing whether these workers need to be W-2 workers and on the city's payroll, so that's an evaluation that's going to be going on.

1817
02:25:12,688 --> 02:25:17,371
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're gonna continue to review all processes for elections to ensure efficiency.

1818
02:25:17,772 --> 02:25:36,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Candidly, Danielle and I were just talking about one major element of this budget process, which is the elections, city elections or town elections now have the ability to get reimbursed from the state for costs associated with early voting and vote by mail.

1819
02:25:37,959 --> 02:25:44,823
[SPEAKER_14]: And in summary, now that I've gone through a process, Danielle's obviously done it in her prior community as well.

1820
02:25:45,223 --> 02:25:53,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Now that I've gone through a process to actually submit for that reimbursement, I understand the system well, and I understand, you know, the parameters of the system.

1821
02:25:53,728 --> 02:25:55,349
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we can plan

1822
02:25:55,922 --> 02:25:57,443
[SPEAKER_14]: to maximize our reimbursement.

1823
02:25:57,583 --> 02:26:00,665
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we can pre-plan for the election to maximize our reimbursement.

1824
02:26:00,705 --> 02:26:02,166
[SPEAKER_14]: We were actually just chatting about that.

1825
02:26:02,687 --> 02:26:11,973
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's one avenue when I say continue to look for opportunities for efficiency, but it's efficiency and cost effectiveness ultimately.

1826
02:26:14,934 --> 02:26:23,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, we want the department to continue to attend professional development trainings, review all polling locations for accessibility and backups.

1827
02:26:23,519 --> 02:26:33,986
[SPEAKER_14]: We did get an email from, I'm not sure of the organization, but they mentioned an issue with potential accessible parking at one of our voting locations.

1828
02:26:34,086 --> 02:26:37,408
[SPEAKER_14]: I've transmitted that information over to Danielle, and I've asked her to take a look at it.

1829
02:26:37,468 --> 02:26:40,330
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to continue to pursue those reviews as well.

1830
02:26:41,226 --> 02:26:50,469
[SPEAKER_14]: And then one thing I think Danielle could probably talk to is some of the work in particular that she could speak to is some of the work that she's done in other communities as to expanding voter outreach.

1831
02:26:50,969 --> 02:26:53,310
[SPEAKER_14]: So I will pause there.

1832
02:26:53,330 --> 02:26:55,131
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good segue for Danielle.

1833
02:26:59,244 --> 02:27:01,926
[SPEAKER_01]: things I was most passionate about was getting the youth involved.

1834
02:27:02,006 --> 02:27:05,868
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually worked with one of the government teachers at Everett High School.

1835
02:27:06,228 --> 02:27:08,650
[SPEAKER_01]: We would hold voter drives a couple times a year.

1836
02:27:09,050 --> 02:27:12,832
[SPEAKER_01]: We would go into the government class, kind of teach them about the process of voting.

1837
02:27:13,633 --> 02:27:17,295
[SPEAKER_01]: We implemented a student poll worker program that kind of grew over the years.

1838
02:27:17,315 --> 02:27:20,957
[SPEAKER_01]: I think last year we had about 50 students who worked.

1839
02:27:20,977 --> 02:27:24,399
[SPEAKER_01]: So they could do everything that an adult poll worker could do.

1840
02:27:24,419 --> 02:27:26,500
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of buddied up with a veteran poll worker.

1841
02:27:27,201 --> 02:27:27,361
[SPEAKER_01]: And

1842
02:27:29,142 --> 02:27:29,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone loved it.

1843
02:27:29,843 --> 02:27:31,143
[SPEAKER_01]: The students were a big hit.

1844
02:27:31,183 --> 02:27:32,684
[SPEAKER_01]: The students loved the older poll workers.

1845
02:27:32,704 --> 02:27:34,426
[SPEAKER_01]: The older poll workers loved the students.

1846
02:27:34,746 --> 02:27:36,087
[SPEAKER_01]: They formed great relationships.

1847
02:27:37,027 --> 02:27:39,889
[SPEAKER_01]: We also held voting drives at a lot of the city events.

1848
02:27:40,810 --> 02:27:44,692
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would go there, have a little booth for voter outreach.

1849
02:27:44,833 --> 02:27:57,381
[SPEAKER_01]: We reached out to some of the local colleges, sent voter registrations to them, sent out saying that we needed poll workers to those schools to try to recruit them that way.

1850
02:27:59,142 --> 02:28:12,774
[SPEAKER_01]: local nursing homes to get as many as the residents registered and able to vote on election day, whether that was us actually going there and helping them vote or sending the ballots and picking them up.

1851
02:28:13,795 --> 02:28:15,677
[SPEAKER_01]: So just trying to get as many people

1852
02:28:16,437 --> 02:28:22,298
[SPEAKER_01]: all ages and all backgrounds registered and able to vote.

1853
02:28:22,318 --> 02:28:26,619
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different ways you can vote now by mail, early, in person.

1854
02:28:27,059 --> 02:28:29,139
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's accessible to a lot of people.

1855
02:28:29,159 --> 02:28:36,721
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just getting that information out there so that people know that it's available and how they can vote in the most convenient way for them.

1856
02:28:40,121 --> 02:28:40,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1857
02:28:40,501 --> 02:28:41,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

1858
02:28:42,182 --> 02:28:44,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions to Vice President Collins?

1859
02:28:46,165 --> 02:28:47,165
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for being here.

1860
02:28:47,366 --> 02:28:48,286
[SPEAKER_17]: It's great to meet you.

1861
02:28:48,666 --> 02:28:56,909
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for joining the team and I know you've heard a lot from staff I'm sure and your colleagues the city hall.

1862
02:28:58,029 --> 02:28:59,590
[SPEAKER_17]: How happy we are to have you on board.

1863
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:13,543
[SPEAKER_17]: full-time job, probably more like one and a half at least most of the time, but we're really happy to have you and to have you bring so much experience and enthusiasm to this role.

1864
02:29:14,563 --> 02:29:19,365
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're excited to work with you and support you however we can this election year and going forward.

1865
02:29:19,845 --> 02:29:24,786
[SPEAKER_17]: I have just one clarifying question on the budget before us, which I think is probably more for Nina.

1866
02:29:25,746 --> 02:29:29,328
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you spoke to this, but if you could just run me through, I see the

1867
02:29:31,078 --> 02:29:35,540
[SPEAKER_17]: the decrease in salaries part-time, I see the increase in salaries seasonal.

1868
02:29:36,400 --> 02:29:39,841
[SPEAKER_17]: If there's a short way to just explain how that all shakes out.

1869
02:29:41,102 --> 02:29:41,682
[SPEAKER_14]: I think so.

1870
02:29:42,342 --> 02:29:45,944
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not the most brief person as you've probably noticed.

1871
02:29:45,984 --> 02:29:46,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Me neither.

1872
02:29:46,484 --> 02:29:47,324
[SPEAKER_13]: But I will try.

1873
02:29:47,344 --> 02:29:54,607
[SPEAKER_14]: In summary, there's this reimbursement for the early voting costs.

1874
02:29:54,627 --> 02:29:56,928
[SPEAKER_14]: So a lot of those costs have shifted over to that area.

1875
02:29:57,968 --> 02:30:00,349
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've right-sized this to take into account

1876
02:30:01,598 --> 02:30:08,640
[SPEAKER_14]: that reimbursement area where we'd ultimately apply a lot of those costs for early voting and vote by mail.

1877
02:30:09,361 --> 02:30:11,881
[SPEAKER_14]: And I apologize, say that again?

1878
02:30:12,742 --> 02:30:14,922
[SPEAKER_17]: Would that be for the seasonals, for the part-time?

1879
02:30:15,903 --> 02:30:18,223
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be essentially for seasonals, yes.

1880
02:30:18,243 --> 02:30:19,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, that makes sense.

1881
02:30:19,184 --> 02:30:20,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1882
02:30:20,804 --> 02:30:21,865
[SPEAKER_14]: Essentially, you know,

1883
02:30:24,753 --> 02:30:36,364
[SPEAKER_14]: When crafting this budget, through you, Mr. President, when crafting this budget, I found that there wasn't enough lines, and I just expanded those lines.

1884
02:30:36,524 --> 02:30:44,031
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was actually one of the first things Danielle said, and I said, well, I went to the City of Everett website, and I stole the budget lines that you guys had, and I used that.

1885
02:30:44,171 --> 02:30:47,754
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is kind of, it's just kind of being drawn out a little bit more.

1886
02:30:48,695 --> 02:30:48,915
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1887
02:30:54,500 --> 02:30:57,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like to say, we're very grateful to have you here.

1888
02:30:57,784 --> 02:31:00,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to the city of Medford.

1889
02:31:00,807 --> 02:31:10,678
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure that everybody here is an elected official can tell you our own stories about how chaotic the November elections were and how.

1890
02:31:11,238 --> 02:31:32,166
[SPEAKER_11]: personally stressful it was I would just encourage you if you see anything in the elections office that you think could be fixed in terms of making things more efficient or you know just anything you see then please feel free to bring it to council's attention or to fix it

1891
02:31:33,487 --> 02:31:34,367
[SPEAKER_11]: fix it yourself.

1892
02:31:34,427 --> 02:31:59,104
[SPEAKER_11]: So I went to the, you know, I chatted with some of the elections workers a couple of weeks ago and just kind of saw how they were doing manual data entry on what looked like very outdated software, just spending a lot of time entering the voter registration cards prior to the March elections.

1893
02:32:00,865 --> 02:32:11,292
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not an expert on things like that, but it did seem like there was some room for improvement, either in terms of whatever software they're using, um, or just.

1894
02:32:12,793 --> 02:32:21,779
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not I'm not really sure if you would have any ideas on that, but if there is a way that council can help support that in the future and make the elections department more.

1895
02:32:22,400 --> 02:32:28,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Scalable or efficient or less prone to having these kind of mistakes that we've seen in previous years, we're all ears.

1896
02:32:29,662 --> 02:32:33,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the system is a state run system.

1897
02:32:33,324 --> 02:32:35,766
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no, we have to use that one.

1898
02:32:36,786 --> 02:32:38,808
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in the process of upgrading it.

1899
02:32:38,828 --> 02:32:41,569
[SPEAKER_01]: It was supposed to go into effect before the September election.

1900
02:32:41,609 --> 02:32:44,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it got pushed back to next year.

1901
02:32:45,112 --> 02:32:48,314
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is a 19, a system that was started in 1996.

1902
02:32:48,374 --> 02:32:54,137
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a little outdated and slow, but that's the whole state has no option but to use that.

1903
02:32:54,177 --> 02:32:56,479
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just trying to work around it the best we can.

1904
02:32:57,677 --> 02:33:07,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was a lot of the clerks there just taking in these handwritten cards and just typing in names, and it seemed like it was taking them five minutes.

1905
02:33:07,181 --> 02:33:08,102
[SPEAKER_13]: To register people?

1906
02:33:08,142 --> 02:33:17,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I was just kind of looking at it like, okay, I hope that this can be done better, but obviously it's a state-run system then.

1907
02:33:18,146 --> 02:33:22,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the good news is most people now kind of register online, whether it's at the RMV.

1908
02:33:22,748 --> 02:33:26,229
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't get as many of those handwritten cards as we used to.

1909
02:33:26,630 --> 02:33:30,291
[SPEAKER_01]: But those that we do, we still have to type it ourselves.

1910
02:33:32,172 --> 02:33:32,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1911
02:33:32,532 --> 02:33:35,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1912
02:33:35,694 --> 02:33:37,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had one question.

1913
02:33:37,734 --> 02:33:38,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry, Justin.

1914
02:33:38,675 --> 02:33:38,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

1915
02:33:41,094 --> 02:33:51,081
[SPEAKER_06]: might be similar, but I wanted to ask about when we were doing last year's election budget, something that came up was the drop in the number of FTEs.

1916
02:33:51,181 --> 02:33:56,385
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a big conversation about whether that was the right choice.

1917
02:33:56,405 --> 02:33:58,706
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think a lot of different perspectives on it.

1918
02:33:59,647 --> 02:34:01,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I can understand different perspectives on it.

1919
02:34:01,608 --> 02:34:03,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't expect any change to this budget.

1920
02:34:04,630 --> 02:34:07,292
[SPEAKER_06]: For the position that we're in right now, this is reasonable.

1921
02:34:08,173 --> 02:34:20,342
[SPEAKER_06]: In our last governance committee meeting, we talked about letting you come on and then evaluate the situation and maybe come back to us to talk about this in half a year or so.

1922
02:34:20,822 --> 02:34:22,483
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did want to raise that to your attention.

1923
02:34:24,008 --> 02:34:31,291
[SPEAKER_06]: that this is a point of conversation on the council and with the administration about the resources needed for this department.

1924
02:34:31,452 --> 02:34:34,293
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, again, just wanted to put that nugget out there.

1925
02:34:34,513 --> 02:34:41,296
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if the president had questions about that, because I know this is something that we had talked about before, too.

1926
02:34:42,357 --> 02:34:42,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no.

1927
02:34:42,917 --> 02:34:45,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think it remains to be seen to me.

1928
02:34:46,379 --> 02:34:50,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, things are getting done, and I appreciate the update and transparency.

1929
02:34:53,837 --> 02:34:54,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it remains to be seen.

1930
02:34:54,798 --> 02:34:59,923
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see how these upcoming elections go, given that this is the budget we're looking at citywide.

1931
02:35:00,944 --> 02:35:04,087
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes it a little tougher to say, let's add two positions in the elections department.

1932
02:35:04,107 --> 02:35:05,929
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be the most of any department in the whole city.

1933
02:35:06,830 --> 02:35:16,740
[SPEAKER_05]: But I certainly still have some outstanding questions of if the staffing level is sufficient for the level of work, or if there needs to be additional budgeting around the part-time and the seasonal.

1934
02:35:17,807 --> 02:35:17,887
[SPEAKER_05]: that.

1935
02:35:17,907 --> 02:35:19,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I respect that it's a moving target.

1936
02:35:19,728 --> 02:35:23,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Um and respect that, uh, your leadership and you know, we'll see.

1937
02:35:24,009 --> 02:35:24,590
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see how it goes.

1938
02:35:24,650 --> 02:35:29,751
[SPEAKER_05]: And I trust that there will be an honesty that if there is more needed that you'll come to us with the need and then I respect that.

1939
02:35:29,771 --> 02:35:36,234
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, my question was actually around more Councilor Lemming's question just around the voter list.

1940
02:35:36,794 --> 02:35:38,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Um you know, it does seem to be getting up there.

1941
02:35:45,336 --> 02:36:08,750
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, maybe not, but do you think that the updates to the state registration system or any work that you guys are planning to do maybe after these two elections might weed out some of the folks who have moved away but might still be listed and maybe they moved out of state so they didn't re-register in Massachusetts so the state system isn't pulling them out of Medford and putting them somewhere else, those kind of things?

1942
02:36:09,830 --> 02:36:17,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we just actually got a list in the mail from Florida and Maine, I think, that had sent us some lists.

1943
02:36:17,377 --> 02:36:25,565
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, you can't remove voters without a signature unless they haven't voted or filled out a census for four consecutive years.

1944
02:36:25,625 --> 02:36:34,694
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you didn't vote in two consecutive federal elections, after that four years, when we run the inactive report to send out the confirmation cards, it will delete.

1945
02:36:35,034 --> 02:36:37,735
[SPEAKER_01]: those voters, confirmation cards have to be sent out.

1946
02:36:37,755 --> 02:36:42,616
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now there's no one eligible to be deleted in that sense.

1947
02:36:42,736 --> 02:36:50,319
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in the next couple of years, you know, that that will catch up with that after this federal election, maybe in the next years.

1948
02:36:50,379 --> 02:36:50,939
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah.

1949
02:36:51,900 --> 02:36:55,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately, even when you know they moved out, you have to wait that four years if you can't get a signature.

1950
02:36:55,822 --> 02:37:01,885
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the times on the census, they'll send back moves, but they won't give us an address to send the delete voter form.

1951
02:37:02,665 --> 02:37:10,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there was an error in 2021, where people were moved, marked inactive inaccurately, and then all marked active.

1952
02:37:10,609 --> 02:37:18,293
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know how the backend of the system works, but could that maybe have restarted a bunch of four consecutive year clocks at that point?

1953
02:37:18,726 --> 02:37:30,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think, I don't know how in the past if confirmation cards were sent out every year, but that has to be like logged in the system, like you have to for it, the clock to start has to be every year.

1954
02:37:30,393 --> 02:37:36,017
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's where like there was, there might've been like one year where it either didn't get sent out or it didn't get put in the system.

1955
02:37:36,077 --> 02:37:38,738
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're starting from scratch again.

1956
02:37:38,858 --> 02:37:39,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

1957
02:37:39,619 --> 02:37:39,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1958
02:37:40,119 --> 02:37:40,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1959
02:37:41,880 --> 02:37:43,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further questions on the elections department?

1960
02:37:45,444 --> 02:37:48,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, any questions from the public on the Elections Department?

1961
02:37:51,228 --> 02:37:53,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, thank you so much and welcome to Medford.

1962
02:37:53,889 --> 02:37:54,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1963
02:37:59,913 --> 02:38:05,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Facilities Department, Director Riggi, thank you for sitting it out.

1964
02:38:06,937 --> 02:38:07,398
[SPEAKER_13]: No problem.

1965
02:38:09,679 --> 02:38:12,461
[SPEAKER_05]: And the rivalry between the Council and IT grows.

1966
02:38:16,287 --> 02:38:18,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

1967
02:38:18,610 --> 02:38:25,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw we forced Rich to eat some food.

1968
02:38:26,359 --> 02:38:28,702
[SPEAKER_05]: He's so bored and hungry, he went for the food.

1969
02:38:32,246 --> 02:38:34,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, Mr. Iggy.

1970
02:38:35,885 --> 02:38:36,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Facilities department.

1971
02:38:37,547 --> 02:38:37,888
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go.

1972
02:38:37,908 --> 02:38:38,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just go through it.

1973
02:38:38,789 --> 02:38:39,770
[SPEAKER_05]: You've watched everyone else.

1974
02:38:39,790 --> 02:38:40,331
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's up.

1975
02:38:40,351 --> 02:38:41,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiscal 24 $1,000,619,513 fiscal 25 $1,000,865,594 one head count.

1976
02:38:51,184 --> 02:38:52,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiscal 24, that's you.

1977
02:38:52,566 --> 02:38:54,428
[SPEAKER_05]: One headcount Fiscal 25, that's you.

1978
02:38:55,108 --> 02:38:59,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like about a 15% increase, all of that being essentially fixed cost growth.

1979
02:39:00,394 --> 02:39:03,096
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of an increase because of the non-union salary.

1980
02:39:04,057 --> 02:39:08,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Utility costs, electric and gas prices going up, that's a budget of 100 increase of $140,000.

1981
02:39:08,902 --> 02:39:11,245
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the cleaning contract increased $100,000.

1982
02:39:13,807 --> 02:39:14,828
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's really it.

1983
02:39:15,028 --> 02:39:26,957
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to share about what you've been doing fiscal 24 plans for fiscal 25, and then anything that isn't in this budget that you think may be needed for your department in the future, either new staff or other expenses.

1984
02:39:27,057 --> 02:39:27,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1985
02:39:28,638 --> 02:39:32,100
[SPEAKER_09]: I was able to get 3 of our buildings under HVAC.

1986
02:39:33,101 --> 02:39:35,363
[SPEAKER_09]: maintenance contracts, which was a big thing.

1987
02:39:36,705 --> 02:39:46,834
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been consolidating services to save money so we have only one pest control company, one alarm company, so we're saving money that way.

1988
02:39:48,056 --> 02:39:48,376
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll see

1989
02:39:49,977 --> 02:39:52,438
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also the Chevalier is part of the budget.

1990
02:39:52,778 --> 02:39:54,979
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just one staff person right now.

1991
02:39:55,079 --> 02:40:03,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the money for the Chevalier comes out of casino funding or paybacks from our client that uses the facility.

1992
02:40:04,723 --> 02:40:09,905
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the big accomplishments was finally finishing the facade project at Chevalier.

1993
02:40:10,885 --> 02:40:13,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Engine 3 is getting ready hopefully to reopen.

1994
02:40:14,746 --> 02:40:19,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping that July 1st, we can get that company back to Engine 3 on Salem Street.

1995
02:40:19,448 --> 02:40:21,269
[SPEAKER_05]: And was that about concrete or weather?

1996
02:40:21,329 --> 02:40:23,109
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the slab project.

1997
02:40:23,149 --> 02:40:25,670
[SPEAKER_09]: The slab was failing, so we needed to get that done.

1998
02:40:25,730 --> 02:40:28,911
[SPEAKER_09]: And as we opened it up, we found additional problems.

1999
02:40:29,651 --> 02:40:38,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I've also done some waterproofing and other items there at that station so they can be dry and we can protect that slab.

2000
02:40:38,914 --> 02:40:39,895
[SPEAKER_09]: So that'll be opening.

2001
02:40:42,055 --> 02:40:43,896
[SPEAKER_09]: This year, I'm working on

2002
02:40:45,267 --> 02:40:51,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Fire headquarters redesign, starting that project, and anything else that may come my way.

2003
02:40:51,971 --> 02:40:55,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Council Chambers windows will hopefully be replaced totally.

2004
02:40:55,894 --> 02:41:01,738
[SPEAKER_09]: I did some glass replacements and we found some structural issues with the windows.

2005
02:41:02,318 --> 02:41:07,742
[SPEAKER_09]: So, another big accomplishment is the city now has a house doctor.

2006
02:41:08,362 --> 02:41:09,062
[SPEAKER_09]: the city of Met for three years.

2007
02:41:09,082 --> 02:41:16,347
[SPEAKER_09]: We have three firms on call on their architectural firms, so any department in the city and also the school department can call these.

2008
02:41:17,487 --> 02:41:18,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Architectural firms.

2009
02:41:18,608 --> 02:41:28,353
[SPEAKER_09]: They've guaranteed pricing for the city of Met for three years, and they can provide architectural support for any major projects that we may encounter.

2010
02:41:28,834 --> 02:41:29,814
[SPEAKER_09]: That was something that.

2011
02:41:30,555 --> 02:41:31,475
[SPEAKER_09]: The city has been trying to

2012
02:41:37,858 --> 02:41:47,984
[SPEAKER_09]: In the future, I think what I'm really going to be looking at is the facilities department and actually creating a department.

2013
02:41:48,305 --> 02:41:57,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Last year, I was only here for a couple of months when I did my budget, so I'm still trying to figure out what was up and what was going on.

2014
02:41:59,572 --> 02:42:03,155
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some maintenance workers that have a different reporting structure.

2015
02:42:03,195 --> 02:42:05,976
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we need to bring them into the facilities

2016
02:42:07,538 --> 02:42:09,699
[SPEAKER_09]: and maybe increase the staff.

2017
02:42:10,339 --> 02:42:13,702
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not just one person for 18 different buildings in the city.

2018
02:42:14,402 --> 02:42:15,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

2019
02:42:15,203 --> 02:42:16,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that 18 including the schools?

2020
02:42:17,244 --> 02:42:17,384
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2021
02:42:18,125 --> 02:42:28,792
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've also, I'm technically not supposed to work at the schools, but I've been helping as much as I can in the schools for support and helping them with different projects at the schools.

2022
02:42:29,133 --> 02:42:29,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2023
02:42:29,513 --> 02:42:33,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's personally, I think there's great opportunities for synergy there, but.

2024
02:42:34,741 --> 02:42:36,303
[SPEAKER_05]: We will leave the law for another day.

2025
02:42:36,323 --> 02:42:40,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question.

2026
02:42:40,807 --> 02:42:41,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions?

2027
02:42:41,849 --> 02:42:42,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Collins.

2028
02:42:43,951 --> 02:42:45,072
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for being here.

2029
02:42:45,312 --> 02:42:48,556
[SPEAKER_17]: I really appreciate the straightforward, very legible budget.

2030
02:42:49,378 --> 02:42:53,922
[SPEAKER_17]: questions that I had on the utilities and the contractor services you already explained.

2031
02:42:54,642 --> 02:43:05,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Utilities, the city was very lucky about almost four years ago, signed an electric contract which electric rates were very low, so we were guaranteed for three-year pricing.

2032
02:43:06,312 --> 02:43:09,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, that contract came up last November.

2033
02:43:10,195 --> 02:43:11,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Electric prices went through the roof.

2034
02:43:12,597 --> 02:43:18,662
[SPEAKER_09]: We have another three-year contract, but we're still paying substantially lower than if we

2035
02:43:19,242 --> 02:43:21,283
[SPEAKER_09]: went through National Grid to get our electric.

2036
02:43:21,383 --> 02:43:22,903
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's it.

2037
02:43:23,003 --> 02:43:29,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Contracted services, I found that the DPW building does not have any outside cleaning.

2038
02:43:29,566 --> 02:43:31,706
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're adding that starting in July.

2039
02:43:32,187 --> 02:43:36,748
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, the library is open six days a week, but we only provide cleaning for five days.

2040
02:43:37,168 --> 02:43:42,650
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're adding the six-day Saturday, so we can make sure the library is clean for the residents.

2041
02:43:43,791 --> 02:43:44,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

2042
02:43:44,571 --> 02:43:45,131
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much.

2043
02:43:45,251 --> 02:43:45,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

2044
02:43:45,471 --> 02:43:45,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2045
02:43:45,951 --> 02:43:47,552
[SPEAKER_05]: My only question... Oh, sorry.

2046
02:43:48,737 --> 02:43:51,919
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, I just missed part of what you're saying about the house doctor.

2047
02:43:52,019 --> 02:43:53,860
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that essentially like an on-call?

2048
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:56,382
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an on-call architect.

2049
02:43:57,662 --> 02:44:10,149
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a state model where they have that for any state agency and cities and towns can put out an RFP to request architecture firms to provide pricing.

2050
02:44:10,970 --> 02:44:16,433
[SPEAKER_09]: We reviewed it, and then we selected three firms to be on-call for the city of Bedford.

2051
02:44:16,873 --> 02:44:17,053
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

2052
02:44:17,622 --> 02:44:19,363
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for all of your proactive work.

2053
02:44:19,423 --> 02:44:23,106
[SPEAKER_05]: My only question, do the new windows come with drapes?

2054
02:44:24,047 --> 02:44:26,769
[SPEAKER_09]: That we have to talk about.

2055
02:44:27,049 --> 02:44:38,978
[SPEAKER_09]: I received some ARPA funding from the mayor to do some things, so hopefully I can stretch the ARPA funding to figure out once we do the windows, what we can do with the shades and the drapes.

2056
02:44:39,639 --> 02:44:41,640
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't need four-piece drapes.

2057
02:44:41,721 --> 02:44:42,921
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be talking about that.

2058
02:44:42,961 --> 02:44:47,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, aesthetically we should do some, I agree with that.

2059
02:44:48,871 --> 02:44:50,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought we should keep the ripped one, though.

2060
02:44:52,334 --> 02:44:53,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been focused.

2061
02:44:53,655 --> 02:44:56,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll bring that to the... Everyone else has been talking.

2062
02:44:58,900 --> 02:45:01,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Chevalier, $32,000 staying flat.

2063
02:45:02,303 --> 02:45:05,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this all funded through casino money or half funded?

2064
02:45:05,766 --> 02:45:08,609
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's our portion of that.

2065
02:45:09,249 --> 02:45:12,292
[SPEAKER_09]: The rest of the funding comes from the same budget.

2066
02:45:12,352 --> 02:45:14,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions for facilities in Chevalier?

2067
02:45:16,986 --> 02:45:17,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions?

2068
02:45:18,327 --> 02:45:18,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry, go ahead.

2069
02:45:18,888 --> 02:45:19,228
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2070
02:45:19,989 --> 02:45:22,931
[SPEAKER_17]: You said half is funded casino mitigation.

2071
02:45:22,971 --> 02:45:25,313
[SPEAKER_17]: That's $32,000?

2072
02:45:25,753 --> 02:45:37,443
[SPEAKER_09]: $32,000 is the maintenance work, and then any other funding we need at the Chevalier comes from our casino mitigation fund and our payments from our Blumenreich.

2073
02:45:37,823 --> 02:45:38,143
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2074
02:45:38,904 --> 02:45:39,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

2075
02:45:39,945 --> 02:45:40,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further questions?

2076
02:45:43,468 --> 02:45:44,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions from members of the public?

2077
02:45:49,130 --> 02:45:51,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Rich, do you have any questions for Paul?

2078
02:45:55,276 --> 02:45:56,277
[SPEAKER_05]: None that you can say publicly.

2079
02:46:00,821 --> 02:46:02,162
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I think that's all we have.

2080
02:46:02,202 --> 02:46:02,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

2081
02:46:02,903 --> 02:46:07,147
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate the work that your department does, that you do.

2082
02:46:10,690 --> 02:46:12,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Information technology.

2083
02:46:17,065 --> 02:46:17,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the coat.

2084
02:46:19,226 --> 02:46:19,706
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good.

2085
02:46:19,806 --> 02:46:20,386
[SPEAKER_05]: It's looking good.

2086
02:46:20,686 --> 02:46:25,648
[SPEAKER_20]: I was supposed to be at dinner, but because the schedule got rearranged by one of you, I got put last.

2087
02:46:25,688 --> 02:46:27,209
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not dinner.

2088
02:46:27,609 --> 02:46:28,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

2089
02:46:28,129 --> 02:46:28,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Dinner for rich.

2090
02:46:29,270 --> 02:46:29,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that really true?

2091
02:46:29,990 --> 02:46:31,691
[SPEAKER_20]: As far as you know.

2092
02:46:35,692 --> 02:46:39,194
[SPEAKER_05]: In cases where you do have urgent plans, always feel free.

2093
02:46:39,934 --> 02:46:40,754
[SPEAKER_05]: We will accommodate.

2094
02:46:40,854 --> 02:46:41,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I give 24-7 for City.

2095
02:46:44,019 --> 02:46:47,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a life other than servicing its needs.

2096
02:46:47,820 --> 02:46:49,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Just don't tell HR.

2097
02:46:52,082 --> 02:46:54,883
[SPEAKER_20]: I am salary exempt, so... Yeah, exactly.

2098
02:46:54,903 --> 02:46:55,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Aren't we all?

2099
02:46:57,204 --> 02:46:59,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Adam, if you could be... Oh, you have a presentation?

2100
02:47:00,965 --> 02:47:02,505
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what professionals do, my friend.

2101
02:47:02,525 --> 02:47:03,866
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, jeez.

2102
02:47:04,206 --> 02:47:08,127
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm glad no one else is here.

2103
02:47:08,167 --> 02:47:09,868
[SPEAKER_20]: We all know what we stand for.

2104
02:47:12,332 --> 02:47:13,412
[SPEAKER_20]: make one big happy face.

2105
02:47:13,432 --> 02:47:16,134
[SPEAKER_11]: This is my favorite presentation so far.

2106
02:47:18,595 --> 02:47:20,035
[SPEAKER_05]: This Rattler is getting two beaded.

2107
02:47:22,116 --> 02:47:22,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

2108
02:47:22,596 --> 02:47:29,619
[SPEAKER_16]: Not only will I make it to the end, I will code it.

2109
02:47:29,679 --> 02:47:30,300
[SPEAKER_13]: All righty.

2110
02:47:33,441 --> 02:47:34,821
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me share.

2111
02:47:38,103 --> 02:47:38,723
[SPEAKER_17]: Go on up here.

2112
02:47:40,304 --> 02:47:40,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Just you and me, right?

2113
02:47:46,035 --> 02:47:46,695
[SPEAKER_20]: Will you wait for me?

2114
02:47:47,615 --> 02:47:47,755
What?

2115
02:47:48,636 --> 02:47:48,976
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, no.

2116
02:47:50,936 --> 02:47:55,977
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you have, um... Usually people wait until I start talking to walk out, so I don't know.

2117
02:47:56,797 --> 02:47:58,078
[SPEAKER_17]: Have you already been made a co-host?

2118
02:47:59,118 --> 02:47:59,958
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I'm trying to figure out.

2119
02:48:00,598 --> 02:48:00,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, yeah.

2120
02:48:02,979 --> 02:48:03,339
[SPEAKER_17]: Cancel.

2121
02:48:05,059 --> 02:48:06,139
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, you are a co-host, I see.

2122
02:48:06,159 --> 02:48:06,459
[SPEAKER_17]: I am, yeah.

2123
02:48:06,579 --> 02:48:08,560
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll shoot you a video.

2124
02:48:08,600 --> 02:48:13,041
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll share it.

2125
02:48:14,001 --> 02:48:14,581
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't let me share.

2126
02:48:25,344 --> 02:48:25,905
[SPEAKER_17]: Share screen.

2127
02:48:27,886 --> 02:48:29,388
[SPEAKER_17]: Solid start to an IT presentation.

2128
02:48:30,028 --> 02:48:32,410
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really a little embarrassing.

2129
02:48:32,890 --> 02:48:33,571
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we go.

2130
02:48:35,613 --> 02:48:35,893
[SPEAKER_20]: Share.

2131
02:48:36,733 --> 02:48:39,235
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.

2132
02:48:41,157 --> 02:48:41,577
[SPEAKER_20]: There you go.

2133
02:48:41,597 --> 02:48:42,058
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all I had.

2134
02:48:42,078 --> 02:48:43,559
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to share a picture of my dog and my cat.

2135
02:48:51,656 --> 02:48:52,958
[SPEAKER_20]: Now they're internet famous.

2136
02:48:53,098 --> 02:48:55,341
[SPEAKER_11]: What are their names?

2137
02:48:56,482 --> 02:48:58,926
[SPEAKER_20]: The dog is Linus and the cat is Larry.

2138
02:49:01,192 --> 02:49:08,098
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, so last year when I was here, I was on day three of the job, and half of you weren't even here yet.

2139
02:49:08,258 --> 02:49:16,225
[SPEAKER_20]: So I figure, I don't know that there's ever been a comprehensive review of technology or technology usage here in the city.

2140
02:49:17,666 --> 02:49:21,249
[SPEAKER_20]: So I thought I'd structure my presentation a little different than other people have been doing them.

2141
02:49:21,830 --> 02:49:23,491
[SPEAKER_20]: Plus, I was an analyst in another life.

2142
02:49:23,531 --> 02:49:24,712
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what we do is presentations.

2143
02:49:26,735 --> 02:49:30,356
[SPEAKER_20]: Just a quick agenda, what I'll be covering, nothing major here.

2144
02:49:30,676 --> 02:49:32,657
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll get through this as quick as possible so we can all go home.

2145
02:49:33,217 --> 02:49:39,059
[SPEAKER_20]: Basically, when I came on board, there was nobody in the position for almost a year and a half.

2146
02:49:39,919 --> 02:49:41,999
[SPEAKER_20]: So they had a help desk.

2147
02:49:42,039 --> 02:49:47,161
[SPEAKER_20]: We have a third party called TOS, a company that does, you know, you can call them, what have you.

2148
02:49:47,841 --> 02:49:49,582
[SPEAKER_20]: get your password reset, get some helpful things.

2149
02:49:49,722 --> 02:49:53,765
[SPEAKER_20]: But that relationship needs to be managed to get them moving in the right direction.

2150
02:49:53,785 --> 02:49:55,245
[SPEAKER_20]: They did the best they could.

2151
02:49:55,586 --> 02:49:56,326
[SPEAKER_20]: There was nobody here.

2152
02:49:56,526 --> 02:49:57,387
[SPEAKER_20]: They didn't have a person.

2153
02:49:58,167 --> 02:50:02,129
[SPEAKER_20]: It's tough to find the right skill set for this job, I think.

2154
02:50:03,310 --> 02:50:06,131
[SPEAKER_20]: So they took their time and did the best they could.

2155
02:50:06,211 --> 02:50:10,154
[SPEAKER_20]: So when I got here, I said, I need to assess everything suit to nuts.

2156
02:50:11,794 --> 02:50:18,916
[SPEAKER_20]: I used to live in Medford, just so you know, so I was well aware of where the city was from a technology standpoint.

2157
02:50:20,417 --> 02:50:26,659
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't feel that in the past 20-25 years much has been done in investment and technology here in the city.

2158
02:50:26,879 --> 02:50:31,180
[SPEAKER_20]: We lag pretty far behind our contemporaries in the area.

2159
02:50:32,220 --> 02:50:36,746
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, so I kind of took a look at what was there and found a, what I expect to find.

2160
02:50:36,766 --> 02:50:42,372
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, this is just a very short list of the things that weren't done properly or hadn't been done at all.

2161
02:50:43,133 --> 02:50:45,475
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, there's a very, very long list that accompanies this.

2162
02:50:45,516 --> 02:50:47,077
[SPEAKER_20]: I can share with anyone that wants to see it.

2163
02:50:47,838 --> 02:50:52,744
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, but just an idea that even the basics weren't done to the degree that should have been done.

2164
02:50:53,184 --> 02:50:54,845
[SPEAKER_20]: hear from what I what I saw.

2165
02:50:56,326 --> 02:51:01,989
[SPEAKER_20]: So setting about that, I said, you know, we're really in a firefighting mode right now.

2166
02:51:02,290 --> 02:51:04,071
[SPEAKER_20]: Everybody has problems all the time.

2167
02:51:04,811 --> 02:51:08,213
[SPEAKER_20]: People just literally just learn to live with the problems they had.

2168
02:51:08,233 --> 02:51:11,495
[SPEAKER_20]: And I find that unacceptable in this kind of position.

2169
02:51:12,116 --> 02:51:15,257
[SPEAKER_20]: So I spent a good amount of time in the beginning,

2170
02:51:16,198 --> 02:51:17,279
[SPEAKER_20]: trying to stabilize things.

2171
02:51:18,080 --> 02:51:27,368
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I worked with the help desk that we have to get them working in the way I wanted them to work, in the way, giving customer service the way I felt they should be giving it.

2172
02:51:28,428 --> 02:51:35,594
[SPEAKER_20]: And then did some other things where I was able to deploy new assets to people that, you know, people have computers over six, seven years old.

2173
02:51:36,315 --> 02:51:39,918
[SPEAKER_20]: They were just frustrated with them, but, you know, they learned to suffer in silence around here.

2174
02:51:40,939 --> 02:51:43,721
[SPEAKER_20]: So did as much as I could to try to get in the first,

2175
02:51:44,522 --> 02:51:46,524
[SPEAKER_20]: three months, four months stability.

2176
02:51:47,084 --> 02:51:47,585
[SPEAKER_20]: And it works.

2177
02:51:48,145 --> 02:51:56,612
[SPEAKER_20]: When I first came on board the TOS, our help desk was averaging about 165 tickets a month calls from end users.

2178
02:51:57,913 --> 02:52:00,215
[SPEAKER_20]: Right now we average about 50 to 55.

2179
02:52:00,255 --> 02:52:03,277
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's a reduction of about 63%.

2180
02:52:04,338 --> 02:52:08,842
[SPEAKER_20]: What that means is people are able to continue to be productive throughout the day, not facing constant interruptions.

2181
02:52:09,482 --> 02:52:12,405
[SPEAKER_20]: And it also frankly frees up my time to work on

2182
02:52:12,925 --> 02:52:19,849
[SPEAKER_20]: what I'm going to spend a little bit of time talking about here, capital projects and improvements and things like that, that are really going to move the city forward.

2183
02:52:20,750 --> 02:52:27,074
[SPEAKER_20]: I was, you know, we had helpdesk, I wasn't brought in to do helpdesk, I was brought in to do digital transformation, and that's what I'm starting to do.

2184
02:52:28,294 --> 02:52:33,257
[SPEAKER_20]: So planning, these are the capital projects we're looking to kick off or have kicked off.

2185
02:52:34,338 --> 02:52:35,059
[SPEAKER_20]: We basically have

2186
02:52:36,155 --> 02:52:39,957
[SPEAKER_20]: Most communities around here build municipal fiber optic networks.

2187
02:52:41,478 --> 02:52:44,139
[SPEAKER_20]: They did the most of that work between 2007 and 2012.

2188
02:52:44,839 --> 02:52:45,679
[SPEAKER_20]: Medford never did it.

2189
02:52:46,800 --> 02:52:49,661
[SPEAKER_20]: So that was high on my list to get started.

2190
02:52:50,322 --> 02:52:54,624
[SPEAKER_20]: One of the original thinking was they were going to put in fiber to the fire stations.

2191
02:52:55,524 --> 02:52:59,566
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I kind of took over that project and said, you know, why don't we do a bunch of the other municipal buildings?

2192
02:53:00,166 --> 02:53:07,791
[SPEAKER_20]: So the first part of it will be all the fire stations will be connected City Hall, Council on Aging, Library, DPW.

2193
02:53:08,732 --> 02:53:15,877
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we will work in another phase, and I'll talk about that a little bit later, of tying up the rest of the buildings in there.

2194
02:53:16,777 --> 02:53:21,758
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll go into a little more detail on another slide just because I think it helps to understand.

2195
02:53:22,539 --> 02:53:27,040
[SPEAKER_20]: People look at the costs and they say, why are we spending that much when it seems to be fine now?

2196
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,040
[SPEAKER_20]: I can speak to that a little bit.

2197
02:53:30,200 --> 02:53:36,762
[SPEAKER_20]: City Hall, where we are now, there's at least four different generations going back about 30 years of cabling the network.

2198
02:53:36,782 --> 02:53:37,782
[SPEAKER_20]: We had to replace all that.

2199
02:53:37,862 --> 02:53:40,523
[SPEAKER_20]: It just doesn't make sense anymore to struggle with it.

2200
02:53:41,103 --> 02:53:42,463
[SPEAKER_20]: We have problems with it all the time.

2201
02:53:43,444 --> 02:53:44,584
[SPEAKER_20]: I always say the network here is

2202
02:53:45,024 --> 02:53:46,687
[SPEAKER_20]: a couple of cans and a piece of string.

2203
02:53:48,369 --> 02:53:54,417
[SPEAKER_20]: Then, you know, one of the other important products too is, so the fourth one down, the Zetron replacement.

2204
02:53:54,437 --> 02:54:01,247
[SPEAKER_20]: So the Zetron is the system that public safety uses in the 911 center to alert the fire stations, you know, they have a

2205
02:54:02,348 --> 02:54:11,453
[SPEAKER_20]: A robust system that can tell them all kinds of different things, where it is, what have you, alerts them, wakes them up on a sound sleep by turning the lights on and playing this crazy space invader's noise.

2206
02:54:11,513 --> 02:54:14,035
[SPEAKER_20]: It freaks you out the first time you're in a station and it goes off.

2207
02:54:14,835 --> 02:54:16,736
[SPEAKER_20]: Doesn't even bother the firefighters, it's hilarious.

2208
02:54:18,097 --> 02:54:25,741
[SPEAKER_20]: But that is really the sort of nexus of that is in the actual 911 call center where the operator is taking the calls.

2209
02:54:25,841 --> 02:54:26,622
[SPEAKER_20]: Right now it's about

2210
02:54:28,022 --> 02:54:29,363
[SPEAKER_20]: 22 or 23 year old system.

2211
02:54:30,043 --> 02:54:39,206
[SPEAKER_20]: The new system has a whole bunch of automations in it where it can really reduce the workload of someone when they're on a call with somebody that's in a crisis situation.

2212
02:54:39,886 --> 02:54:44,388
[SPEAKER_20]: They can focus on the person calling and less on keystrokes and things like that.

2213
02:54:44,468 --> 02:54:47,069
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're pretty excited about that and the fire department is.

2214
02:54:48,549 --> 02:54:53,854
[SPEAKER_20]: And then just here in general in the city, and I'll talk about the phone system a little bit too.

2215
02:54:53,874 --> 02:55:01,821
[SPEAKER_20]: We're replacing all the phones because they're an end of life for forever and a day and the phone system is, yeah, if you've ever used it, it's a mess.

2216
02:55:02,602 --> 02:55:05,505
[SPEAKER_20]: And it saves us a whole host of money by doing this.

2217
02:55:06,246 --> 02:55:09,648
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we're hopefully, we're in the valuation phase right now.

2218
02:55:10,228 --> 02:55:17,493
[SPEAKER_20]: If you look at the way our HR department, their workflow, it's all paper and moving papers around and what have you.

2219
02:55:18,783 --> 02:55:19,863
[SPEAKER_20]: really just difficult on them.

2220
02:55:19,883 --> 02:55:26,206
[SPEAKER_20]: There's only two HR folks, you know, it's Lisa obviously, but two generals in their benefits and in our recruitment.

2221
02:55:27,787 --> 02:55:31,328
[SPEAKER_20]: So, they have to spend a vast majority of their time just doing everything manually.

2222
02:55:32,008 --> 02:55:38,791
[SPEAKER_20]: And if you go down and say, can I get a list of all the employees of the DPW, you know, sort of thing and start qualifying things,

2223
02:55:39,511 --> 02:55:40,772
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just a manual process.

2224
02:55:40,792 --> 02:55:43,954
[SPEAKER_20]: It could take them days to get through to find the data.

2225
02:55:44,314 --> 02:55:45,795
[SPEAKER_20]: So we've looked at HRS systems.

2226
02:55:46,656 --> 02:55:47,516
[SPEAKER_20]: I know what they can do.

2227
02:55:48,437 --> 02:55:54,140
[SPEAKER_20]: We were evaluating some of the vendors out there that I think will fit an organization of our size.

2228
02:55:54,200 --> 02:56:01,125
[SPEAKER_20]: And hopefully this year, mid-year, fall-ish, we can start bringing that in and piloting it.

2229
02:56:02,739 --> 02:56:08,903
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just want to go on a little more detail on the fiber because people look at the cost and say, well, why are we spending that?

2230
02:56:09,604 --> 02:56:13,726
[SPEAKER_20]: It's an infrastructure project, and it's kind of the basis of everything we're going to do going forward.

2231
02:56:14,527 --> 02:56:25,894
[SPEAKER_20]: But just as when I have a methodology of going through asking for money for projects, it has to return a certain amount of money or self-fund itself over time.

2232
02:56:26,515 --> 02:56:30,978
[SPEAKER_20]: So when you add up all the money we spend now by having distributors

2233
02:56:31,638 --> 02:56:37,201
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, systems and what have you, you know, every location building has its own internet connection.

2234
02:56:37,541 --> 02:56:40,883
[SPEAKER_20]: So yeah, it's a you're paying $200 a month doesn't seem like a big deal.

2235
02:56:40,923 --> 02:56:41,764
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll multiply that up by 17.

2236
02:56:42,524 --> 02:56:45,506
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what we have in terms of tens of thousands of dollars.

2237
02:56:46,066 --> 02:56:49,108
[SPEAKER_20]: We do this project, we have one internet connection for the city.

2238
02:56:50,488 --> 02:56:55,250
[SPEAKER_20]: So, it's things like that, and then I don't have to buy duplicates of hardware, because I have to put hardware at every end point.

2239
02:56:55,410 --> 02:56:59,131
[SPEAKER_20]: I can get rid of all that infrastructure and not have to pay those maintenance contracts.

2240
02:56:59,551 --> 02:57:00,372
[SPEAKER_20]: So, it kind of snowballs.

2241
02:57:00,432 --> 02:57:01,752
[SPEAKER_20]: It makes administration easier.

2242
02:57:01,812 --> 02:57:02,852
[SPEAKER_20]: Those costs go down.

2243
02:57:03,893 --> 02:57:10,575
[SPEAKER_20]: So, it just kind of even just the first year, you know, we turn it live, you're looking at $110,000.

2244
02:57:10,615 --> 02:57:13,776
[SPEAKER_20]: I won't have to spend an additional money somewhere else.

2245
02:57:14,596 --> 02:57:15,537
[SPEAKER_20]: So, do you have a question?

2246
02:57:20,623 --> 02:57:22,686
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I didn't want to take him at the end or whatever.

2247
02:57:24,028 --> 02:57:24,649
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys do you.

2248
02:57:24,669 --> 02:57:27,453
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay, whatever.

2249
02:57:27,774 --> 02:57:28,855
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll sell you for the hand up, so.

2250
02:57:33,467 --> 02:57:35,188
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the same thing with the phone system.

2251
02:57:35,468 --> 02:57:38,089
[SPEAKER_20]: Right now, we get way overcharged by our phone vendor.

2252
02:57:38,109 --> 02:57:43,132
[SPEAKER_20]: Hopefully, they're not watching this, because I need them to keep going for a little while longer.

2253
02:57:44,272 --> 02:57:48,714
[SPEAKER_20]: But the call series, we were actually able to roll the fire department in.

2254
02:57:48,754 --> 02:57:50,275
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be able to cancel their contract.

2255
02:57:50,695 --> 02:57:58,759
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the only people that will be outside of the phone system after we're done would be police and schools.

2256
02:57:59,299 --> 02:58:02,341
[SPEAKER_20]: And those are two organizations that I don't currently support.

2257
02:58:03,722 --> 02:58:16,341
[SPEAKER_20]: So they would be on their own, but everybody else you think, rec department, chevalier, DPW yard, council on aging, fire department finally will all be wrapped to the new phone systems and then you save 38 grand a year.

2258
02:58:19,042 --> 02:58:19,783
[SPEAKER_20]: So let's talk about the budget.

2259
02:58:21,185 --> 02:58:22,186
[SPEAKER_20]: We can take a look at that.

2260
02:58:22,507 --> 02:58:26,252
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a little, I don't know if you've got a chance to really go through it.

2261
02:58:27,033 --> 02:58:33,301
[SPEAKER_20]: I moved a bunch of things around just because to make it easier from an administrative standpoint, I combined some accounts that were legacy accounts.

2262
02:58:33,341 --> 02:58:35,184
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't even know what the original intent of them was.

2263
02:58:37,026 --> 02:58:44,392
[SPEAKER_20]: So when we go through this, it looks like they stole a bunch of money from me, but it's not really accurate.

2264
02:58:45,413 --> 02:58:50,757
[SPEAKER_20]: We were paying the support for what's called admins, our financial software package, out of my budget.

2265
02:58:51,438 --> 02:58:56,182
[SPEAKER_20]: It didn't really make any sense to do that anymore, so I just transferred that back to finance.

2266
02:58:56,922 --> 02:59:01,666
[SPEAKER_20]: It's literally just fill out a piece of paper every year, so there's no point in me having to worry about that.

2267
02:59:02,487 --> 02:59:03,087
[SPEAKER_20]: And then,

2268
02:59:04,169 --> 02:59:12,091
[SPEAKER_20]: More importantly, we see an addition of about 51,000 or so in the consulting, I think it's consulting.

2269
02:59:13,029 --> 02:59:13,650
[SPEAKER_20]: professional services.

2270
02:59:15,071 --> 02:59:21,417
[SPEAKER_20]: So last night, my esteemed colleagues in the library went and talked about technology and what they use and what have you.

2271
02:59:22,218 --> 02:59:26,482
[SPEAKER_20]: So they had been under their own sort of support contract for their technology.

2272
02:59:26,502 --> 02:59:28,504
[SPEAKER_20]: The past few, it predates me being here.

2273
02:59:29,525 --> 02:59:30,366
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not very efficient.

2274
02:59:30,767 --> 02:59:33,189
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to have economies of scale and put everything in one.

2275
02:59:33,229 --> 02:59:35,411
[SPEAKER_20]: You can negotiate, you've got a negotiating power.

2276
02:59:36,192 --> 02:59:41,517
[SPEAKER_20]: So we thought about it and said, why don't we move that over into my budget?

2277
02:59:41,938 --> 02:59:43,159
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I'll manage this.

2278
02:59:43,179 --> 02:59:45,281
[SPEAKER_20]: They use the same company for support that we do.

2279
02:59:45,301 --> 02:59:46,803
[SPEAKER_20]: It would just make sense.

2280
02:59:46,823 --> 02:59:48,504
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I would go back and negotiate with them.

2281
02:59:48,625 --> 02:59:53,509
[SPEAKER_20]: Both contracts are up July 1st and say, you know, what can we do to combine these things?

2282
02:59:53,549 --> 02:59:55,772
[SPEAKER_20]: Where are there efficiencies we can, you know,

2283
02:59:57,293 --> 02:59:58,394
[SPEAKER_20]: make it a little better for everyone.

2284
02:59:58,854 --> 03:00:01,196
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm still in the negotiation phases.

2285
03:00:01,556 --> 03:00:02,877
[SPEAKER_20]: It's going pretty well.

2286
03:00:03,097 --> 03:00:04,719
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think we're that far apart.

2287
03:00:05,559 --> 03:00:08,562
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah, that money was added over there to account for that.

2288
03:00:08,582 --> 03:00:15,107
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's before anybody gets the, you know, we're underfunding the library and the IT director is taking books out of children's hands.

2289
03:00:15,147 --> 03:00:16,428
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not really the story.

2290
03:00:16,448 --> 03:00:19,070
[SPEAKER_20]: We're just moving the money from one spot to the other.

2291
03:00:19,130 --> 03:00:22,493
[SPEAKER_20]: And the day it gets spent, they get the same quality service they've been used to.

2292
03:00:22,973 --> 03:00:25,195
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing changes in that regard.

2293
03:00:26,156 --> 03:00:29,219
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's just want to make that clear.

2294
03:00:29,279 --> 03:00:35,386
[SPEAKER_20]: So Zach, if you have any questions on the budget numbers or anything, just let me know because I'm going to move on real quick.

2295
03:00:36,307 --> 03:00:41,092
[SPEAKER_20]: And then there's this, I don't know, I don't even know if I finished this slide, but it was more cost savings.

2296
03:00:41,612 --> 03:00:43,574
[SPEAKER_20]: It was just low hanging fruit, you know,

2297
03:00:44,255 --> 03:00:47,798
[SPEAKER_20]: Fire departments always left them their own to their own devices for technology.

2298
03:00:49,079 --> 03:00:52,942
[SPEAKER_20]: Why, I have no idea, but I'm happy that I'm able to support them now.

2299
03:00:53,642 --> 03:01:03,250
[SPEAKER_20]: But then in going over contracts and whatever, I found just a few things that it was easy to roll into either my budget or just cancel out right as we had redundant systems.

2300
03:01:03,870 --> 03:01:06,813
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's really all that that's trying to show there.

2301
03:01:07,553 --> 03:01:09,135
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that's it.

2302
03:01:12,489 --> 03:01:15,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Director Lane, thank you very much for your thorough presentation.

2303
03:01:15,672 --> 03:01:16,173
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2304
03:01:16,473 --> 03:01:18,816
[SPEAKER_05]: A model for all of us.

2305
03:01:20,798 --> 03:01:21,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions for members of the Council?

2306
03:01:21,859 --> 03:01:23,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Lemmon, then Councillor Collins.

2307
03:01:24,585 --> 03:01:24,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2308
03:01:25,305 --> 03:01:30,387
[SPEAKER_11]: It's clear that you've been busy since you started here, and we're very grateful to have you.

2309
03:01:30,607 --> 03:01:32,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it two questions?

2310
03:01:32,748 --> 03:01:49,693
[SPEAKER_11]: First, is it logistically possible either technically or administratively to connect to get the school system as well onto the same Internet connection, potentially for more savings?

2311
03:01:49,733 --> 03:01:51,594
[SPEAKER_11]: You mentioned their Medford City Hall,

2312
03:01:53,694 --> 03:01:59,279
[SPEAKER_11]: library and some other place that wasn't the public schools.

2313
03:01:59,599 --> 03:02:01,521
[SPEAKER_20]: I currently don't support the school system.

2314
03:02:01,561 --> 03:02:05,804
[SPEAKER_20]: The school systems generally are networked slightly different.

2315
03:02:05,924 --> 03:02:06,785
[SPEAKER_20]: The reason for that is this.

2316
03:02:07,625 --> 03:02:11,729
[SPEAKER_20]: When you have a Comcast or Verizon coming to your town,

2317
03:02:12,389 --> 03:02:13,411
[SPEAKER_20]: generally shake them down.

2318
03:02:13,471 --> 03:02:17,298
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, you negotiate with them to do certain things for the municipality.

2319
03:02:17,939 --> 03:02:22,407
[SPEAKER_20]: And that generally involves bringing fiber optic technology out to all the schools.

2320
03:02:22,547 --> 03:02:23,749
[SPEAKER_20]: All the schools are connected.

2321
03:02:23,849 --> 03:02:24,971
[SPEAKER_20]: These things are recorded.

2322
03:02:28,428 --> 03:02:30,130
[SPEAKER_20]: So all the schools currently are connected.

2323
03:02:30,190 --> 03:02:35,434
[SPEAKER_20]: We were actually strangely connected from here, that room right in there, up to the high school.

2324
03:02:36,955 --> 03:02:40,938
[SPEAKER_20]: Now the connection's broken, doesn't work right now, but it's Comcast originally put it in.

2325
03:02:41,539 --> 03:02:45,222
[SPEAKER_20]: Of course, Comcast doesn't run fiber anymore, so there's not much we can do about that.

2326
03:02:45,742 --> 03:02:50,646
[SPEAKER_20]: But we are this year, I believe, renegotiating with Verizon and Comcast again for the city.

2327
03:02:51,387 --> 03:02:55,070
[SPEAKER_20]: So we'll certainly have some latitude on what we can do.

2328
03:02:55,150 --> 03:02:55,590
[SPEAKER_20]: I would love

2329
03:02:56,351 --> 03:02:57,712
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I'm not going to say what I was going to say.

2330
03:02:57,772 --> 03:03:02,176
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah, I would have some latitude to get some things upgraded or updated where we need to be.

2331
03:03:02,577 --> 03:03:06,921
[SPEAKER_20]: But to answer your question, not that I'm avoiding it, right now schools aren't in scope.

2332
03:03:06,961 --> 03:03:09,323
[SPEAKER_20]: They have their own IT person up there.

2333
03:03:09,343 --> 03:03:14,308
[SPEAKER_20]: It just wouldn't be feasible the way things are architected to do that.

2334
03:03:14,668 --> 03:03:14,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2335
03:03:15,629 --> 03:03:16,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Second question.

2336
03:03:16,330 --> 03:03:20,235
[SPEAKER_11]: What was the $131 spent on a part-time employee?

2337
03:03:20,816 --> 03:03:24,521
[SPEAKER_20]: I have no idea how that got in there or why that's been in there.

2338
03:03:24,561 --> 03:03:29,087
[SPEAKER_20]: There's also for, there was something in there for a dollar for conferences.

2339
03:03:29,127 --> 03:03:30,548
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm like, who's going to a dollar conference?

2340
03:03:31,589 --> 03:03:37,312
[SPEAKER_20]: But the 131 doesn't show up in my budget as a line item.

2341
03:03:37,672 --> 03:03:40,413
[SPEAKER_20]: I will say one thing about the salaries down the bottom.

2342
03:03:41,073 --> 03:03:44,355
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to make it clear that I did not get an 8% raise.

2343
03:03:45,555 --> 03:03:52,238
[SPEAKER_20]: That is simply from, some of the department heads, predates me, were in a sort of union.

2344
03:03:53,499 --> 03:03:55,840
[SPEAKER_20]: We decided not to go forward with that in December.

2345
03:03:56,420 --> 03:04:05,002
[SPEAKER_20]: So that triggered the administration giving us the 2% for 3 fiscal years retro back there.

2346
03:04:05,162 --> 03:04:11,964
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I believe this is accounting for a 1.3% increase for fiscal year 2025.

2347
03:04:12,464 --> 03:04:13,224
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's just that.

2348
03:04:13,264 --> 03:04:15,845
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not that I got a raise or anything.

2349
03:04:16,205 --> 03:04:23,466
[SPEAKER_20]: So you'll see that a lot of the poverty heads, probably about 9 or 10, they didn't really get bumped up.

2350
03:04:24,087 --> 03:04:24,647
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just retro.

2351
03:04:25,527 --> 03:04:25,787
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2352
03:04:28,971 --> 03:04:31,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, any other questions for Councilor Iya, Councilor Collins?

2353
03:04:32,532 --> 03:04:34,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for being so forthcoming about that.

2354
03:04:34,452 --> 03:04:36,813
[SPEAKER_17]: I did notice on some other budgets, so thank you for speaking to it.

2355
03:04:37,573 --> 03:04:40,454
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you as well for the most visual presentation of the night.

2356
03:04:40,694 --> 03:04:40,974
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2357
03:04:41,234 --> 03:04:47,916
[SPEAKER_17]: And no specific question for you, just it's great to hear some of the details about, in addition to the whole scope of what you're doing, a lot of the consolidation of systems.

2358
03:04:49,016 --> 03:04:50,457
[SPEAKER_17]: This is great to hear.

2359
03:04:50,737 --> 03:04:51,357
[SPEAKER_17]: Happy that we're doing that.

2360
03:04:51,617 --> 03:04:51,817
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2361
03:04:53,001 --> 03:04:57,365
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to personally thank you for all the assistance you've given to us here.

2362
03:04:58,346 --> 03:05:00,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Emergency assistance, not emergency assistance.

2363
03:05:01,069 --> 03:05:08,596
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a much better digital setup up here now for chairs of the council, council committees, school committee to

2364
03:05:10,618 --> 03:05:15,721
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, be working on Zoom, managing it, there's a physical hard connection in case the Wi-Fi goes out.

2365
03:05:15,961 --> 03:05:22,784
[SPEAKER_05]: So making this kind of a foolproof setup up here as best as possible, even though I'm sure we try to file it up as much as we can.

2366
03:05:24,945 --> 03:05:26,706
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just been really great.

2367
03:05:26,866 --> 03:05:28,127
[SPEAKER_05]: So really thankful for that.

2368
03:05:28,467 --> 03:05:32,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Also for working with Kevin Harrington and myself on some of the

2369
03:05:33,854 --> 03:05:39,316
[SPEAKER_05]: consulting us on the audio visual upgrade and work in the clerk's office as well.

2370
03:05:39,356 --> 03:05:40,496
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to really thank you for that.

2371
03:05:41,156 --> 03:05:46,418
[SPEAKER_05]: And next time, especially if you're bringing slides next year, I may not remember this, but I hope you remember it.

2372
03:05:46,438 --> 03:05:47,518
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go first.

2373
03:05:48,619 --> 03:05:59,843
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're on big, long night, seriously, and you've reminded me that I said it, if I'm still the president, fingers crossed, that's a commitment I'm happy to make.

2374
03:05:59,863 --> 03:06:01,063
[SPEAKER_12]: No problem.

2375
03:06:04,963 --> 03:06:07,364
[SPEAKER_05]: put it in your calendar, mostly because I want everyone to come with a PowerPoint.

2376
03:06:07,444 --> 03:06:08,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a great thing.

2377
03:06:09,184 --> 03:06:10,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised nobody does.

2378
03:06:12,925 --> 03:06:14,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

2379
03:06:14,766 --> 03:06:16,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any questions for members of the public?

2380
03:06:18,147 --> 03:06:25,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing no members of the public present in the chamber or on Zoom, you are free to go.

2381
03:06:25,829 --> 03:06:26,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

2382
03:06:26,250 --> 03:06:27,810
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2383
03:06:28,070 --> 03:06:30,151
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we did make you miss dinner, I do apologize.

2384
03:06:37,472 --> 03:06:40,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Last department of the night, law department.

2385
03:06:41,574 --> 03:06:44,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief of staff Nesarian representing the administration.

2386
03:06:45,616 --> 03:06:46,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Law department budget, fiscal 24, $552,403.

2387
03:06:46,937 --> 03:06:47,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiscal 25, $530,035.80.

2388
03:06:47,297 --> 03:06:49,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Head count going down from three to two, minus 4% growth.

2389
03:06:49,198 --> 03:06:53,541
[SPEAKER_05]: The decrease is due to the reduction and removal of the assistant city clerk and some minor reductions in ordinary expenses.

2390
03:06:53,561 --> 03:06:55,142
[SPEAKER_05]: There is an increase in the

2391
03:07:07,355 --> 03:07:11,378
[SPEAKER_05]: City solicitor salary increase in the budget for outside legal counsel.

2392
03:07:12,499 --> 03:07:13,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief of staff Nazarian.

2393
03:07:17,002 --> 03:07:18,543
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I said assistant city solicitor, right?

2394
03:07:19,604 --> 03:07:19,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

2395
03:07:20,024 --> 03:07:21,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Assistant city solicitor.

2396
03:07:21,125 --> 03:07:21,846
[SPEAKER_05]: My apologies.

2397
03:07:24,688 --> 03:07:25,108
[SPEAKER_05]: What a night.

2398
03:07:25,368 --> 03:07:31,213
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so the removal of the assistant city solicitor position, taking the full-time head count down from three to two.

2399
03:07:31,993 --> 03:07:35,616
[SPEAKER_05]: And so with that, we'll go to the chief of staff for,

2400
03:07:37,239 --> 03:07:37,880
[SPEAKER_05]: further presentation.

2401
03:07:38,601 --> 03:07:39,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello again.

2402
03:07:39,041 --> 03:07:52,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, you know, I know that the council's, you know, very well aware of the challenges that we're facing and the school department budget and you know the where the mayor myself and the finance team have been working hard to try to

2403
03:07:52,892 --> 03:07:55,454
[SPEAKER_14]: to find the millions more that the school department needs.

2404
03:07:57,315 --> 03:08:10,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Candidly, the mayor asked that I say that if it were up to her, obviously we work collaboratively with the council, that she would propose removing both the city solicitor and the assistant city solicitor from the budget and using those dollars to go to

2405
03:08:14,056 --> 03:08:23,123
[SPEAKER_14]: the school department and then using that the KP law resource to continue the work that we believe is allowed the city to move forward very.

2406
03:08:23,780 --> 03:08:24,700
[SPEAKER_14]: the city solicitor position.

2407
03:08:24,720 --> 03:08:24,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Um.

2408
03:08:24,780 --> 03:08:27,161
[SPEAKER_14]: More quickly, especially on a number of different areas.

2409
03:08:27,721 --> 03:08:40,746
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, as the mayor asked that I say, um, you know, she views this as a compromise to allow the assistant city solicitor funds to go to, uh, the school department, essentially, so those funds can be used by schools.

2410
03:08:41,387 --> 03:08:43,908
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know, maintain the city solicitor position.

2411
03:08:45,128 --> 03:08:45,948
[SPEAKER_14]: I do think that there's

2412
03:08:53,590 --> 03:09:10,667
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's a challenging scenario, but I have said before, I've said probably year after year in front of this council, the number of disciplines, and I will read the list of disciplines that we really do draw upon with KP law can't be matched by a two-person city solicitor team.

2413
03:09:10,707 --> 03:09:11,248
[SPEAKER_14]: It just can't.

2414
03:09:12,829 --> 03:09:14,491
[SPEAKER_14]: So from that perspective, I don't...

2415
03:09:16,641 --> 03:09:26,428
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't believe the council's under any impressions that that would be the case, but the reality is that we would always need an outside vendor.

2416
03:09:27,068 --> 03:09:32,332
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's important that we have an outside vendor that can provide the level of support that our organization needs.

2417
03:09:32,412 --> 03:09:35,414
[SPEAKER_14]: There are so many disciplines specific, and I'll just touch on those really quick.

2418
03:09:37,428 --> 03:09:44,636
[SPEAKER_14]: labor and employment contracts, our procurement offices often reaching out to KP law reviewing contracts.

2419
03:09:44,856 --> 03:09:48,240
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a there's a lot that happens there.

2420
03:09:48,260 --> 03:09:53,026
[SPEAKER_14]: I just happened to start my time in the city of Medford on it in a temporary basis.

2421
03:09:53,743 --> 03:09:55,725
[SPEAKER_14]: in the procurement office, essentially.

2422
03:09:55,785 --> 03:10:02,812
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know firsthand as to how much work that office uses under the retainer, fortunately.

2423
03:10:03,713 --> 03:10:08,237
[SPEAKER_14]: Real estate, land use, environmental, governmental information.

2424
03:10:10,679 --> 03:10:13,460
[SPEAKER_14]: and access, construction, litigation.

2425
03:10:13,580 --> 03:10:15,660
[SPEAKER_14]: We didn't discuss this earlier, I'm surprised.

2426
03:10:15,700 --> 03:10:33,005
[SPEAKER_14]: I meant to mention it, but obviously the recount, I'm surprised it didn't come up, but the recount that we had in December of 2023, obviously we got what is believed and across the state to be the expert in that area, Attorney Lauren Goldberg.

2427
03:10:33,025 --> 03:10:39,247
[SPEAKER_14]: I think many of the council members interacted with her, Attorney Goldberg, at that recount, and I'm sure you found her to be just as professional as

2428
03:10:40,207 --> 03:10:41,628
[SPEAKER_14]: We have experience.

2429
03:10:41,648 --> 03:10:44,089
[SPEAKER_14]: She's the managing partner of the law firm, fortunately.

2430
03:10:44,769 --> 03:10:52,872
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're very lucky to not only have her insight, expertise, and the ability to reach out to her and ask her any questions.

2431
03:10:53,072 --> 03:10:57,054
[SPEAKER_14]: As I said before, we were lucky enough to have her connect us with the city of Everett.

2432
03:10:57,314 --> 03:11:07,118
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's tangible and intangible benefits that I think that the city is receiving from the partnership that we've had for the last few years.

2433
03:11:09,339 --> 03:11:13,782
[SPEAKER_14]: So that just at a high level addresses the change in terms of staffing.

2434
03:11:14,282 --> 03:11:23,667
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm happy to go through more information on the narrative and the goals for next year.

2435
03:11:23,707 --> 03:11:28,569
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all very broad, but I'm happy to go through it if the council thinks it would be beneficial.

2436
03:11:31,251 --> 03:11:34,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Any requests for the narrative or objections to the narrative?

2437
03:11:35,093 --> 03:11:35,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anyone want to hear it?

2438
03:11:40,023 --> 03:11:41,765
[SPEAKER_05]: seeing those very broad, very broad.

2439
03:11:41,785 --> 03:11:44,248
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it's going to provide you that much.

2440
03:11:44,308 --> 03:11:46,270
[SPEAKER_14]: So just save yourselves the time.

2441
03:11:46,470 --> 03:11:53,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to say that that is certainly no comment on the wonderful work of Jada Spencer, our office manager and confidential secretary.

2442
03:11:53,858 --> 03:11:54,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2443
03:11:54,098 --> 03:11:56,261
[SPEAKER_14]: We wouldn't, this wouldn't, this truly wouldn't be

2444
03:11:57,702 --> 03:11:58,242
[SPEAKER_14]: the city solicitor.

2445
03:11:58,262 --> 03:11:58,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Um.

2446
03:11:58,323 --> 03:12:03,386
[SPEAKER_14]: This this set up that we presently have in the absence of the city solicitor, and we've been trying.

2447
03:12:04,067 --> 03:12:04,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Um.

2448
03:12:05,247 --> 03:12:17,916
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't comment on the adjustment to the city solicitor salary that's proposed here, but we did receive the council's request, and we did do our best to be as equitable as possible across the organization by taking our

2449
03:12:24,821 --> 03:12:40,750
[SPEAKER_14]: in a direction that would skew things significantly across the organization because we have a lot of highly skilled professionals who have licensure that, you know, I'd love to see a class, the class and comp study to really help us with these things is the reality of the situation.

2450
03:12:40,810 --> 03:12:51,015
[SPEAKER_14]: So the only other thing I was going to say back to Janice, Miss Janice Spencer, I really don't know how to thank her for all the work she's done.

2451
03:12:52,616 --> 03:12:53,717
[SPEAKER_14]: She's the one who helps us

2452
03:12:54,966 --> 03:13:03,292
[SPEAKER_14]: keep the glue together with that department, but she's also taken on the responsibility of records access officer in the absence of a city solicitor, which is a monumental task.

2453
03:13:04,353 --> 03:13:18,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Occasionally, she'll tell me the challenges she faces, you know, people will ask for a record, she'll get back to them, they'll be asked to pay an amount, and then they'll, you know, have frustrations that they haven't received the documentation, but it does take a long time.

2454
03:13:18,064 --> 03:13:21,366
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have many, many departments that she has to reach out to

2455
03:13:22,988 --> 03:13:50,171
[SPEAKER_14]: compiled documents, and it's not always 10 days, because under the law, we have 10 days to respond and provide an estimate of how much time it might take, because there are circumstances where the pile, I mean, I've had the building commissioner send me a photo of a pile about this high of public records that needed to be copied for, you know, one public records request, and that's just one, and we receive, I'd guess, hundreds a month

2456
03:13:50,811 --> 03:13:59,199
[SPEAKER_14]: hundreds, and that's not including police, for instance, because they have their own records access officer, and I believe fire as well, but I'd have to double check that.

2457
03:14:01,140 --> 03:14:03,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, police gets a lot more public records requests, too, so.

2458
03:14:05,844 --> 03:14:06,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2459
03:14:06,065 --> 03:14:06,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

2460
03:14:06,465 --> 03:14:07,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, questions from the council.

2461
03:14:07,686 --> 03:14:09,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins, Councilor Lemming.

2462
03:14:11,089 --> 03:14:12,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for the presentation.

2463
03:14:12,570 --> 03:14:13,071
[SPEAKER_17]: Appreciate it.

2464
03:14:16,442 --> 03:14:17,863
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have any specific questions for you.

2465
03:14:17,883 --> 03:14:21,625
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to go on the record and state some impressions given in good faith.

2466
03:14:25,326 --> 03:14:38,453
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, it's no secret to anybody that the Council has for a couple of terms been advocating for increased capacity within our in-house legal department, and I do hear you on the breadth of experience and expertise that KP Law brings to the table.

2467
03:14:40,157 --> 03:14:42,960
[SPEAKER_17]: In many occasions, we benefited from having them as available resource.

2468
03:14:43,680 --> 03:14:51,367
[SPEAKER_17]: I also think it's still true that they serve a different function than what we're hoping to expand in the in-house law department.

2469
03:14:53,689 --> 03:15:00,576
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, keeping and maintaining the role of city solicitor and assistant city solicitor

2470
03:15:01,488 --> 03:15:03,450
[SPEAKER_17]: over the long term is something that's really important to me.

2471
03:15:04,371 --> 03:15:10,876
[SPEAKER_17]: We know that this budget season, or I would say, speaking for myself, I'm also aware that this budget season is an extenuating circumstance.

2472
03:15:12,658 --> 03:15:22,727
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I think I'm still, as with the rest of the budget, you know, most of the budgets that we've received, the departmental budgets we've received, don't have any big changes, like there isn't a great change in headcount.

2473
03:15:22,747 --> 03:15:28,672
[SPEAKER_17]: This is one where there is, and I think it's gonna take me more than a day and a half to kind of absorb that and, you know, see how I feel about it.

2474
03:15:29,538 --> 03:15:34,503
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that that's going to come down to, you know, the context of the overall budget proposal that we receive.

2475
03:15:35,503 --> 03:15:42,049
[SPEAKER_17]: Because of course, you know, these changes this year are all about context and making sure that we're putting resources where they're really needed.

2476
03:15:42,069 --> 03:15:50,196
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, I'm talking about, you know, the schools and making sure that we are maintaining our baseline, you know, across the city and schools as an organization this year.

2477
03:15:53,119 --> 03:15:55,221
[SPEAKER_17]: But at the same time, you know, this feels like a big change.

2478
03:15:55,612 --> 03:16:02,598
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I know this earlier this spring, the council advocated for actually increasing the salary allocated to both city solicitor and city solicitor.

2479
03:16:02,659 --> 03:16:07,083
[SPEAKER_17]: So I do understand that if the premise is, why don't we nix both?

2480
03:16:07,223 --> 03:16:14,910
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a compromise from that starting position, but from the starting position of we want to be competitive with other cities to fill both positions, this is a pretty big change.

2481
03:16:16,031 --> 03:16:17,512
[SPEAKER_17]: Just wanted to put that out there for the record.

2482
03:16:17,532 --> 03:16:20,095
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, that's how I'm absorbing this proposed change.

2483
03:16:22,159 --> 03:16:39,371
[SPEAKER_17]: and I also, you know, like I said, just to reiterate, I think that as with anything this year, it's gonna come down to the context of the overall budget that we're passing this year and our plans for how we're going to fill gaps citywide.

2484
03:16:40,812 --> 03:16:41,312
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much.

2485
03:16:41,332 --> 03:16:43,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Vice President Collins.

2486
03:16:43,994 --> 03:16:44,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lemming.

2487
03:16:47,196 --> 03:16:47,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2488
03:16:49,122 --> 03:17:00,199
[SPEAKER_11]: So hypothetically, if we did have a city solicitor, how much do you think it would decrease the line some of the line items here as well?

2489
03:17:00,260 --> 03:17:01,401
[SPEAKER_11]: So how much would so.

2490
03:17:03,803 --> 03:17:15,290
[SPEAKER_11]: KB law, it sounds like from what you're saying would be necessary, even in the case that we did have a city solicitor for more specialized services, how much of the services that.

2491
03:17:16,071 --> 03:17:22,635
[SPEAKER_11]: They're providing now, and an approximate dollar amount, do you think could be done by by in house legal?

2492
03:17:26,266 --> 03:17:28,928
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be an incredibly difficult question to answer.

2493
03:17:29,989 --> 03:17:36,454
[SPEAKER_14]: It really depends on the specialty experience or otherwise of the incoming city solicitor, for instance.

2494
03:17:36,994 --> 03:17:41,918
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, if that city solicitor has decades of experience, that would be a different equation.

2495
03:17:42,478 --> 03:17:48,162
[SPEAKER_14]: If that city solicitor is relatively new to municipal sector or, you know,

2496
03:17:51,161 --> 03:17:57,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Frankly, we've met candidates who have worked on the private side only, right?

2497
03:17:57,383 --> 03:18:13,930
[SPEAKER_14]: They would need to get acquainted with the open meeting law, with the public records law, with the... There's another law that somehow I'm not recalling right now as far as document.

2498
03:18:14,710 --> 03:18:16,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Our city clerk, I'm sure would have it at the top of his mind.

2499
03:18:18,536 --> 03:18:23,877
[SPEAKER_14]: document retention, thank you, document retention law, those are, that's like the bread and butter.

2500
03:18:23,897 --> 03:18:25,478
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the standard stuff, right?

2501
03:18:25,498 --> 03:18:44,823
[SPEAKER_14]: The public records and the open meeting law and retention, those things, you know, we had made an offer to a candidate not long ago, that was a New Hampshire solicitor, that person would get need to get acquainted with the city, the state of Massachusetts laws, there's some similarities, but not all.

2502
03:18:45,363 --> 03:18:47,065
[SPEAKER_14]: So it would take some time potentially again.

2503
03:18:47,085 --> 03:18:53,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Something that rewards institutional knowledge, which would be acquired over a period of time.

2504
03:18:53,850 --> 03:18:59,014
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would guess initially they'd be relying on KP law a good amount.

2505
03:18:59,094 --> 03:19:00,756
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the best summary to state, yes.

2506
03:19:02,197 --> 03:19:11,945
[SPEAKER_11]: But it also sounds like from what you're saying, FOIA requests and whatnot, you're personally handling a lot of the tasks that would otherwise fall on in-house legal counsel.

2507
03:19:12,461 --> 03:19:12,881
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not.

2508
03:19:13,621 --> 03:19:17,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Janice Spencer, the office manager in the law department, is handling those.

2509
03:19:18,043 --> 03:19:18,983
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I misheard that.

2510
03:19:19,003 --> 03:19:19,783
[SPEAKER_14]: No worries.

2511
03:19:20,323 --> 03:19:21,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Thankfully, I cannot.

2512
03:19:21,924 --> 03:19:23,164
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel for Janice.

2513
03:19:24,045 --> 03:19:25,145
[SPEAKER_14]: She does a great job.

2514
03:19:25,885 --> 03:19:26,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2515
03:19:28,146 --> 03:19:28,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2516
03:19:28,586 --> 03:19:32,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Zargarpur.

2517
03:19:33,467 --> 03:19:34,288
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been here for a while.

2518
03:19:35,548 --> 03:19:36,928
[SPEAKER_04]: I may be missing it.

2519
03:19:39,348 --> 03:19:42,810
[SPEAKER_04]: The payments that we make to KP Law, what budget does that come out of?

2520
03:19:42,870 --> 03:19:43,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that included here?

2521
03:19:44,070 --> 03:19:45,011
[SPEAKER_14]: That is included here.

2522
03:19:45,971 --> 03:19:49,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, the retainer comes out of this budget.

2523
03:19:50,033 --> 03:19:54,315
[SPEAKER_14]: As you can see on the second line, under ordinary expenses, 010-151-5302 professional service is legal.

2524
03:19:54,355 --> 03:19:55,956
[SPEAKER_14]: The budgeted amount last year was $96,000.

2525
03:19:55,996 --> 03:19:58,337
[SPEAKER_14]: The proposed budgeted amount for this year is $138,000.

2526
03:19:58,397 --> 03:19:58,978
[SPEAKER_14]: This coming year is $138,000.

2527
03:19:59,038 --> 03:20:00,058
[SPEAKER_14]: There was an increase to the cost.

2528
03:20:08,246 --> 03:20:24,317
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess what I'm asking is, if the thinking here is to save an amount of money in the legal department so that it can be used in the school department to balance the budget, how much is being saved?

2529
03:20:25,239 --> 03:20:31,902
[SPEAKER_14]: The proposed savings would be about $78,000, just $79,000, roughly, in the assistant city solicitor.

2530
03:20:31,922 --> 03:20:34,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise, this budget would be that much larger.

2531
03:20:34,683 --> 03:20:45,449
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that is happening in various departments in order to balance the school budget in the meantime, because it's legally required that we have a balanced school budget to present to the state.

2532
03:20:47,470 --> 03:20:53,512
[SPEAKER_04]: But $78,000 is not a very large amount of money for a city's budget.

2533
03:20:56,377 --> 03:20:59,719
[SPEAKER_04]: From my perspective, I'm just saying that.

2534
03:21:01,321 --> 03:21:07,945
[SPEAKER_14]: And to that, if I don't mean to interrupt, but to that, I will say it's not just $78,000.

2535
03:21:08,786 --> 03:21:11,728
[SPEAKER_14]: We have combed through a lot of budgets.

2536
03:21:11,808 --> 03:21:12,849
[SPEAKER_14]: These dollars are adding up.

2537
03:21:13,930 --> 03:21:14,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2538
03:21:14,510 --> 03:21:15,931
[SPEAKER_14]: It's still a very fluid issue.

2539
03:21:15,951 --> 03:21:20,975
[SPEAKER_14]: We learned about that major, that number, the gap last week.

2540
03:21:22,136 --> 03:21:22,896
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been working.

2541
03:21:23,902 --> 03:21:29,526
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I can't say around the clock, because I do sleep, but we have been working diligently on that issue.

2542
03:21:29,626 --> 03:21:38,733
[SPEAKER_14]: And these are ways that we can get pieces put together to make a larger pie to be able to address the school department issue.

2543
03:21:39,113 --> 03:21:40,294
[SPEAKER_14]: It's still a work in progress.

2544
03:21:41,154 --> 03:21:41,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Understood.

2545
03:21:41,915 --> 03:21:42,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2546
03:21:42,515 --> 03:21:42,675
Yeah.

2547
03:21:43,716 --> 03:21:44,797
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going back to Councilor Lemming.

2548
03:21:46,898 --> 03:21:47,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Seng?

2549
03:21:49,711 --> 03:22:00,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I think obviously this is a difficult issue to broach with the Council, because you and the Mayor very much know where most of the Council stands on this.

2550
03:22:01,223 --> 03:22:06,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I think when I think back to our first budget, Councillor Collins and my first budget,

2551
03:22:08,850 --> 03:22:15,854
[SPEAKER_06]: the conversations were that council wanted the solicitor and assistant city solicitor to cut the funding for KP Law.

2552
03:22:16,295 --> 03:22:32,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was a reasonable compromise at that time to put in the two positions and to keep funding for KP Law given what you said about the areas of expertise that KP Law does offer the city, that a lot of city staff have expressed

2553
03:22:34,386 --> 03:22:44,972
[SPEAKER_06]: interest and support for, but I also do very much believe that the solicitor roles are fundamentally just different roles than having legal advisors, legal consultants there.

2554
03:22:46,433 --> 03:22:48,794
[SPEAKER_06]: The interests are different.

2555
03:22:49,114 --> 03:22:54,017
[SPEAKER_06]: The ways that we can use them as a council, access them as a council are different as well.

2556
03:22:55,038 --> 03:22:56,839
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also don't want to re-litigate.

2557
03:22:57,559 --> 03:23:00,440
[SPEAKER_06]: right now, any of those past discussions.

2558
03:23:01,821 --> 03:23:05,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I would agree with Vice President Collins that a lot of this is about context.

2559
03:23:05,542 --> 03:23:08,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I understand the change being made.

2560
03:23:09,743 --> 03:23:20,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't, you know, have a very firm stance on it unless I know what's being made up from it, where, you know, what does the rest of the budget look like.

2561
03:23:21,227 --> 03:23:23,568
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would want to say that, you know,

2562
03:23:24,720 --> 03:23:39,027
[SPEAKER_06]: If the change makes sense, even if the change makes sense, and even if it's something that I could bring myself to support, I would really like to see a path back of adding this position back into the budget come next, the next budget for fiscal 26.

2563
03:23:39,983 --> 03:23:43,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a direction that we'll have to chart.

2564
03:23:44,105 --> 03:23:56,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully in the next month, we'll have a better picture as to how, you know, what's the big picture long-term plan to add the assistant solicitor position back into the general fund.

2565
03:23:59,213 --> 03:23:59,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

2566
03:24:00,974 --> 03:24:06,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't wanna get into... I'm gonna work hard on what I'm about to say.

2567
03:24:08,487 --> 03:24:12,610
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there are other ways to address the school funding issue that do not include this cut.

2568
03:24:13,650 --> 03:24:18,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we are still discussing that, and I'll leave it at that for that element of it.

2569
03:24:20,535 --> 03:24:22,596
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely don't support this model.

2570
03:24:23,257 --> 03:24:25,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly wouldn't support a fully outsourced model.

2571
03:24:28,883 --> 03:24:39,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say that in conversations with council who work for the firm that we are outsourcing to, there have been mentions that the model we are using is unorthodox.

2572
03:24:42,626 --> 03:24:56,250
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think that they would benefit from us moving to that model and for some of those councils to say that they would see an in-house model at least partially being more of a

2573
03:24:57,878 --> 03:25:05,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to say recommendation, but I've heard from members of the legal team that we work with that that element is important.

2574
03:25:05,263 --> 03:25:06,745
[SPEAKER_05]: They think that there's a lot of value there.

2575
03:25:08,486 --> 03:25:11,528
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, that's really where I'm at on it.

2576
03:25:11,608 --> 03:25:19,114
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we had a budget agreement two years ago that was predicated on having two full-time staff members in the law department.

2577
03:25:19,354 --> 03:25:26,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not think that that, I do not think the circumstances of this budget abrogate that agreement.

2578
03:25:26,139 --> 03:25:27,380
[SPEAKER_05]: And I certainly don't think that

2579
03:25:28,953 --> 03:25:33,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there are other ways to find the solution that we're seeking to find by removing this position.

2580
03:25:33,098 --> 03:25:39,005
[SPEAKER_05]: I also don't think that 78,000 is enough at this point to hire a qualified assistant city solicitor, so that's another discussion.

2581
03:25:40,827 --> 03:25:47,454
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I just think that there's a lot of work that

2582
03:25:50,165 --> 03:25:55,126
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this council has been put in a position of not having in-house council that has put us in difficult positions in the past.

2583
03:25:55,286 --> 03:25:57,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we work our best with council.

2584
03:25:57,547 --> 03:26:04,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're very judicious with trying not to reach out to council because we understand that there could be added costs to all of that.

2585
03:26:04,569 --> 03:26:16,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I think basically the way that all of that works has put this council in difficult positions at certain times and having in-house council, a city solicitor,

2586
03:26:17,544 --> 03:26:27,029
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll just add that there have been a variety of processes and procedures that have been drawn out in terms of codification and of ordinances.

2587
03:26:28,470 --> 03:26:34,633
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, it's not a comment so much on any failing of a person as much as it is that

2588
03:26:35,202 --> 03:26:40,104
[SPEAKER_05]: there's no lawyer in this building that you can walk up to their office and say, hey, do you have five minutes?

2589
03:26:41,064 --> 03:26:43,805
[SPEAKER_05]: And know that that's gonna be the position and opinion of the city.

2590
03:26:44,145 --> 03:26:46,486
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that that's an incredibly important thing to have.

2591
03:26:46,546 --> 03:26:49,667
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm glad to see the increased salary here.

2592
03:26:49,687 --> 03:26:52,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that that attracts a qualified candidate.

2593
03:26:52,148 --> 03:27:01,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I think losing the other full-time staff person in the department may detract a qualified candidate from wanting to come here, knowing that they won't have an assistant.

2594
03:27:02,612 --> 03:27:04,813
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are really my main concerns here.

2595
03:27:05,574 --> 03:27:11,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I, my preference would be not even a path in the future, but to just have a level staff funded budget here.

2596
03:27:11,637 --> 03:27:18,141
[SPEAKER_05]: If it gets, uh, if it's a, if it's a take back at the end of the year, like it has been the last three fiscal years is a take back at the end of the year.

2597
03:27:18,241 --> 03:27:18,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

2598
03:27:18,741 --> 03:27:31,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so, or maybe I'm not using the right term, but, uh, um, yeah, I just think that this is, I don't think that using this department's budget,

2599
03:27:32,321 --> 03:27:37,304
[SPEAKER_05]: to address the problems that are being stated is the most judicious course.

2600
03:27:37,605 --> 03:27:38,785
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll leave it at that.

2601
03:27:40,266 --> 03:27:53,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hopeful that we can continue to work collaboratively through the process and understanding of the deep underfunding of the schools and find an alternative to changes in the law department structure.

2602
03:27:54,716 --> 03:27:59,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead, find an alternative to that as we look to close the gap on the school funding.

2603
03:28:02,950 --> 03:28:16,339
[SPEAKER_05]: in the absence of being able to do that, I think some commitment in future budgets that this would be a key priority and that we would look to bring back the second full-time person potentially at a more competitive rate would also be potentially a path that we could take.

2604
03:28:16,519 --> 03:28:18,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Although that's sort of speaking for myself.

2605
03:28:18,120 --> 03:28:20,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where I'm at on this.

2606
03:28:22,524 --> 03:28:28,187
[SPEAKER_05]: It has been certainly a top priority of the council, a major issue and a major question that we've been hearing.

2607
03:28:28,207 --> 03:28:28,247
[SPEAKER_05]: So

2608
03:28:34,434 --> 03:28:40,558
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of places that I would be more than happy and willing to look to address the financial issue.

2609
03:28:40,678 --> 03:28:42,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is one where it's really tough to do that.

2610
03:28:43,920 --> 03:28:46,502
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's all I'll say from my perspective.

2611
03:28:47,703 --> 03:28:50,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further comments by members of the council on the law department budget?

2612
03:28:51,806 --> 03:28:52,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Collins.

2613
03:28:54,548 --> 03:28:54,948
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2614
03:28:55,148 --> 03:29:00,532
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, not to belabor any points, but just I think this is obviously an ongoing conversation.

2615
03:29:01,428 --> 03:29:06,389
[SPEAKER_17]: conversations about any changes to any departmental budget, don't open and close and leave preliminary budget hearing.

2616
03:29:06,409 --> 03:29:08,329
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's one advantage of this new structure.

2617
03:29:08,810 --> 03:29:11,870
[SPEAKER_17]: We have many more opportunities to talk about this, to discuss and negotiate.

2618
03:29:12,890 --> 03:29:25,033
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think one, I think something that's come up for me even just in this one meeting, which I think has been useful and clear in the way that many department heads are thinking about their budgets and the way that we're thinking about the organizational budget overall is

2619
03:29:29,298 --> 03:29:32,259
[SPEAKER_17]: What are we investing in and what's the return that we get from those investments?

2620
03:29:32,859 --> 03:29:39,160
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know in a year where there's a really emergent need, that conversation gets a lot harder.

2621
03:29:39,260 --> 03:29:47,722
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're trying to fill a multi-million gap for the schools and contemplate all possible solutions for doing that.

2622
03:29:47,782 --> 03:29:49,582
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that we have to be talking about all of them.

2623
03:29:51,822 --> 03:29:54,763
[SPEAKER_17]: But I wouldn't want, you know,

2624
03:29:56,718 --> 03:30:04,261
[SPEAKER_17]: what a well-resourced city council is able to do for the city in the short and long term to fall out of that discussion.

2625
03:30:06,842 --> 03:30:20,746
[SPEAKER_17]: Even just thinking about the plans that we have for this year and where I think we're fairly well supported right now on one of our three major, one of our major projects being the zoning overhaul because of the zoning consultant that we do have the resources for for the rest of this fiscal year and the next one.

2626
03:30:22,847 --> 03:30:25,688
[SPEAKER_17]: But we also are going to be working on a city charter

2627
03:30:27,148 --> 03:30:30,489
[SPEAKER_17]: especially we're talking about the context of a major budget shortfall.

2628
03:30:31,729 --> 03:30:41,571
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the few things that this council has direct influence over is making the zoning decisions that affect business development.

2629
03:30:41,611 --> 03:30:52,113
[SPEAKER_17]: That could be one of the pieces of solving our budget deficit for the longer term so we don't keep coming back and having budget discussions like these when we're trying to fill gaps and trying to cut things that really shouldn't be cut.

2630
03:30:54,508 --> 03:31:05,036
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I hope that, I think this is one of the first, apart from the schools, this is one of the first really major consequential, in my opinion, cuts that has been proposed this budget season.

2631
03:31:07,178 --> 03:31:23,070
[SPEAKER_17]: But I don't think that we should, I think that as we contemplate it, we need to consider what we're leaving on the table by not continuing to try to empower the city council with

2632
03:31:24,329 --> 03:31:27,230
[SPEAKER_17]: this piece of the puzzle when it comes to our legal representation.

2633
03:31:27,270 --> 03:31:35,711
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, I feel that me and my fellow counselors who have been on for more than one term have a different perspective on this than folks who have been here for less time.

2634
03:31:35,791 --> 03:31:45,613
[SPEAKER_17]: But I understand that there's a difference, and this doesn't take it all away from what KP Law provides, because everything that you said I think is totally true.

2635
03:31:46,013 --> 03:31:53,635
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's also true that having legal representation that is really for the council is different.

2636
03:31:54,056 --> 03:32:17,326
[SPEAKER_17]: and is responsible to the council in a way that is different, that is accountable to the council's goals, in a way that is distinct from the type of service that KP law provides, and not to say that that in any way diminishes what they do, but just to flesh out the points that I was making previously, because I know sometimes I can be a little abstract, and I just, you know, since this is the first time where

2637
03:32:19,278 --> 03:32:32,501
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilman Singh, this proposed change in public, I just wanted to put that out there for the record of some of what's on my mind as we consider this cut as part of the package that we try to make to cut our way to resolving that deficit.

2638
03:32:33,201 --> 03:32:44,443
[SPEAKER_17]: And what gives me hope is knowing that there are a lot of other solutions that we can, and I know that people are contemplating for how to arrive at a solution that at least

2639
03:32:45,842 --> 03:32:52,146
[SPEAKER_17]: all of the critical functions that the city provides, continuing to provide great service for residents and students and teachers.

2640
03:32:53,447 --> 03:32:55,848
[SPEAKER_17]: So I look forward to continuing that work.

2641
03:32:56,028 --> 03:32:56,308
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2642
03:32:56,829 --> 03:32:57,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

2643
03:32:57,629 --> 03:32:58,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have one more question.

2644
03:33:00,891 --> 03:33:07,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Will there be a cap change presented to the council to reflect the salary change proposed?

2645
03:33:08,156 --> 03:33:11,958
[SPEAKER_05]: And would that come with the budget and with an effective date of July 1, something like that?

2646
03:33:12,526 --> 03:33:16,268
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean, we iron those things out, but essentially there would have there would need to be another paper.

2647
03:33:16,568 --> 03:33:17,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

2648
03:33:17,489 --> 03:33:24,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think just thinking through in my head, that's probably the best way to do it, then we avoid any sort of chapter 40, whatever 43 issues.

2649
03:33:29,975 --> 03:33:33,077
[SPEAKER_05]: When I give you the floor back, I know we all just said a bunch of stuff.

2650
03:33:33,137 --> 03:33:33,918
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

2651
03:33:33,958 --> 03:33:34,518
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it.

2652
03:33:35,253 --> 03:33:35,794
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it.

2653
03:33:36,195 --> 03:33:43,227
[SPEAKER_14]: And I I recognize and I think Councillor saying said it, um, you know, this isn't necessarily an easy conversation.

2654
03:33:43,307 --> 03:33:44,610
[SPEAKER_14]: I recognize that the council.

2655
03:33:45,390 --> 03:33:48,631
[SPEAKER_14]: and the administration have had a number of discussions on this topic.

2656
03:33:49,211 --> 03:33:59,375
[SPEAKER_14]: I think in practicality, you know, I think the way I see it is I don't think that this proposed change really changes anything for the council.

2657
03:33:59,575 --> 03:34:04,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Frankly, you know, and we may end up disagreeing on that, but this is a discussion.

2658
03:34:04,256 --> 03:34:07,017
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something that we will continue to discuss throughout.

2659
03:34:07,137 --> 03:34:11,138
[SPEAKER_14]: And as we try to figure out where, you know, how to

2660
03:34:14,073 --> 03:34:15,494
[SPEAKER_14]: finalize a budget this year, right?

2661
03:34:15,554 --> 03:34:28,381
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, I don't take what I'm saying to be necessarily, I wanna preface the following comments that these are really mine and these are my reflections as chief of staff and not necessarily of the mayors.

2662
03:34:29,722 --> 03:34:40,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably hard to split the two, but I'll try to make that distinction just to tell you that, you know, when I look at this model, as far as the city solicitor is concerned, I think, you know,

2663
03:34:41,727 --> 03:34:46,433
[SPEAKER_14]: We could hire a city solicitor, and we can hire an assistant city solicitor, and they're both going to be bombarded.

2664
03:34:47,434 --> 03:34:50,738
[SPEAKER_14]: And the assistant city solicitor is going to be accountable to the city solicitor.

2665
03:34:51,659 --> 03:34:54,602
[SPEAKER_14]: And the city solicitor is going to be accountable to the administration.

2666
03:34:55,463 --> 03:34:58,166
[SPEAKER_14]: And I say that to be just completely upfront and honest.

2667
03:34:58,206 --> 03:35:00,148
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, these staff positions are

2668
03:35:01,553 --> 03:35:07,637
[SPEAKER_14]: our staff positions of the city, and they are under the direction of the mayor.

2669
03:35:08,078 --> 03:35:17,364
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't say that to say anything other than we are going to continue to work together and collaborate and provide resources and figure out ways to solve.

2670
03:35:17,424 --> 03:35:19,406
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think there's been an incredibly

2671
03:35:21,047 --> 03:35:29,777
[SPEAKER_14]: positive, very large steps towards developing better working relationships, to be completely candid.

2672
03:35:29,837 --> 03:35:33,541
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think any one of us thinks probably any differently.

2673
03:35:33,561 --> 03:35:35,043
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think we see it any differently.

2674
03:35:35,083 --> 03:35:37,425
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's, I think the public can probably see it.

2675
03:35:37,465 --> 03:35:38,386
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's very good.

2676
03:35:39,988 --> 03:35:42,231
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not to say anything other than to say

2677
03:35:44,121 --> 03:35:47,163
[SPEAKER_14]: There's, I don't see a different, I don't see a different resource.

2678
03:35:47,203 --> 03:35:52,066
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see a different approach to the model because I don't think we've,

2679
03:35:53,137 --> 03:36:07,963
[SPEAKER_14]: the council can draw on KP Law, or if it was another firm or another firm, those resources will still be finite, whether we have an assistant city solicitor or not, they will still be finite, no matter how you deal with it.

2680
03:36:08,303 --> 03:36:11,004
[SPEAKER_14]: We have 26 plus department heads in this organization.

2681
03:36:11,304 --> 03:36:12,684
[SPEAKER_14]: We have seven city councilors.

2682
03:36:13,125 --> 03:36:19,527
[SPEAKER_14]: We have, obviously, the mayor and myself, and many others who would need to draw upon.

2683
03:36:19,587 --> 03:36:21,308
[SPEAKER_14]: We have departments

2684
03:36:22,108 --> 03:36:36,177
[SPEAKER_14]: that have staff within them that are contacting legal for advice and resources, whether it's our CPA manager or some other position in the CDBG manager in the organization.

2685
03:36:36,477 --> 03:36:39,839
[SPEAKER_14]: It is not just 26 plus 7 plus 2, it's much more than that.

2686
03:36:40,539 --> 03:36:45,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone, whether having one full-time city solicitor and or

2687
03:36:46,703 --> 03:36:50,285
[SPEAKER_14]: a full-time assistant city solicitor, their time is going to become very narrow.

2688
03:36:50,785 --> 03:37:04,652
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just say that to put into perspective, you know, kind of my angle, and I know the angle that I'm looking at something may not be the angle you're all looking at something, but I want to put in your heads, just like you're putting in my heads, the angles that I see this and how this might play out.

2689
03:37:05,132 --> 03:37:07,173
[SPEAKER_14]: That city solicitor and that city solicitor

2690
03:37:08,308 --> 03:37:10,089
[SPEAKER_14]: they're not going to be able to attend to everything.

2691
03:37:10,549 --> 03:37:15,753
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not going to materially change, in my mind, how the distribution of resources becomes.

2692
03:37:16,273 --> 03:37:20,415
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do believe, and I think maybe I've mistaken.

2693
03:37:20,896 --> 03:37:22,777
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure.

2694
03:37:22,837 --> 03:37:23,497
[SPEAKER_14]: I wasn't here.

2695
03:37:23,577 --> 03:37:24,398
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't speak to it.

2696
03:37:24,438 --> 03:37:33,583
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's my understanding that this council has done such a good job over the past several years that there are more ordinances that are getting pushed through.

2697
03:37:33,603 --> 03:37:35,645
[SPEAKER_14]: And yes, it does take time.

2698
03:37:35,725 --> 03:37:36,405
[SPEAKER_14]: It all takes time.

2699
03:37:36,425 --> 03:37:37,266
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think that's

2700
03:37:38,146 --> 03:37:39,747
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how government works.

2701
03:37:39,827 --> 03:37:41,869
[SPEAKER_14]: And government has to work sometimes, right?

2702
03:37:41,949 --> 03:37:43,630
[SPEAKER_14]: It does take time to go through a process.

2703
03:37:43,990 --> 03:37:49,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes there are scenarios where something gets generated at the city council level.

2704
03:37:50,035 --> 03:37:57,400
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, it's an idea and it gets a draft ordinance gets written and it gets passed to legal to be reviewed.

2705
03:37:57,761 --> 03:38:00,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Legal pulls in our department heads because sometimes that has to happen.

2706
03:38:01,263 --> 03:38:07,568
[SPEAKER_14]: Other times the council members are working with the department head and the department heads already or the necessary department heads are already looped in.

2707
03:38:08,068 --> 03:38:14,870
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there is a good model because we've seen the council be very successful with ordinances and changes and review.

2708
03:38:15,550 --> 03:38:20,191
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's just Nina Nazarian, chief of staff, telling you my perspective and my angle.

2709
03:38:20,211 --> 03:38:26,512
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not meant to take away from anything you all have said, just to tell you that I don't know that much changes.

2710
03:38:26,572 --> 03:38:29,673
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, we're looking at this probably from a different angle.

2711
03:38:31,094 --> 03:38:31,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam Chief.

2712
03:38:31,814 --> 03:38:32,614
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciate that.

2713
03:38:32,654 --> 03:38:35,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what you said highlights, though, the difference.

2714
03:38:38,812 --> 03:38:39,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially for us.

2715
03:38:40,794 --> 03:38:45,480
[SPEAKER_05]: The CPA manager can go ask KP Law for something, but a counselor has to ask me to ask you to ask them.

2716
03:38:46,661 --> 03:38:46,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

2717
03:38:47,382 --> 03:38:49,965
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a different... We don't even have...

2718
03:38:51,243 --> 03:38:52,664
[SPEAKER_05]: the same access to legal counsel.

2719
03:38:52,684 --> 03:39:02,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you haven't denied access and I'm not implying that, but I'm saying that the process for us is like two more steps than it might be for a non-department head staff person.

2720
03:39:04,731 --> 03:39:08,373
[SPEAKER_14]: I will tell you that the CPA manager reaches out to the department head before accessing.

2721
03:39:09,033 --> 03:39:09,574
[SPEAKER_05]: One step more.

2722
03:39:10,114 --> 03:39:14,696
[SPEAKER_14]: There is also, you know, there is also an inherent,

2723
03:39:16,932 --> 03:39:29,524
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, I had this conversation with Councilor Lemming and I, again, this is Nina Nazarian speaking, but, you know, there is, the City Council is a body.

2724
03:39:30,560 --> 03:39:32,401
[SPEAKER_14]: The city council acts as a body.

2725
03:39:33,382 --> 03:39:37,124
[SPEAKER_14]: And those are unique things to consider, right?

2726
03:39:38,105 --> 03:39:49,993
[SPEAKER_14]: If every city councilor were to take a specific action without the city council, without the body's involvement, that would be contrary to how it functions.

2727
03:39:50,473 --> 03:39:54,996
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I say that with all due respect and not meaning to be in any way, shape, or form

2728
03:39:58,041 --> 03:40:02,165
[SPEAKER_14]: minimizing the point you're trying to make, but the council is a body.

2729
03:40:02,745 --> 03:40:08,991
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, that's Nina Nazarian speaking and I'm not meant to be anything but kind of talk this out.

2730
03:40:09,451 --> 03:40:12,073
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of the point I'm making though.

2731
03:40:14,295 --> 03:40:15,937
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't think that

2732
03:40:17,335 --> 03:40:25,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we are members of a legislative body, it limits our rights to reach out to city staff members or to independent resources for research.

2733
03:40:25,277 --> 03:40:27,638
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think we need to debate our theories about that tonight.

2734
03:40:28,438 --> 03:40:30,078
[SPEAKER_05]: More my point is that we make the law.

2735
03:40:31,379 --> 03:40:37,761
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now, we are making laws often without a lawyer in the room who is there to serve us.

2736
03:40:38,081 --> 03:40:39,041
[SPEAKER_05]: We can ask for it.

2737
03:40:39,741 --> 03:40:41,902
[SPEAKER_05]: We work around the schedules of KP Law.

2738
03:40:41,942 --> 03:40:43,222
[SPEAKER_05]: They are often very flexible.

2739
03:40:43,322 --> 03:40:46,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I'm not trying to point fingers at individuals

2740
03:40:48,629 --> 03:41:09,147
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a difference between having someone who represents and works, is paid by just the city of Medford, who works in an office at Medford City Hall, who can build a relationship and grab a snack with a department head or a staff member or sit around a table with the city council in the committee room or here.

2741
03:41:10,336 --> 03:41:13,598
[SPEAKER_05]: versus people that we see on Zoom every so often.

2742
03:41:13,778 --> 03:41:20,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Janelle Austin pretty well now, but I know her now about as well as I knew Mark Rumley or Kim Scanlon.

2743
03:41:21,603 --> 03:41:23,324
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've worked with Janelle for four years.

2744
03:41:23,364 --> 03:41:24,944
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked with Mark Rumley for zero days.

2745
03:41:24,964 --> 03:41:27,606
[SPEAKER_05]: And I worked with Kim Scanlon for a year and a half.

2746
03:41:28,346 --> 03:41:30,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of that is, hey Kim, in the hall.

2747
03:41:31,128 --> 03:41:37,492
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of that is walking into the clerk's office and having a conversation you didn't expect to have that generates a different result.

2748
03:41:37,592 --> 03:41:39,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, to be honest,

2749
03:41:40,771 --> 03:41:46,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Same reason that there's a policy where remote work is not the standard operating procedure of the city, right?

2750
03:41:46,616 --> 03:41:58,344
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because having the people in the place doing the thing is generally perceived, especially in this work, to be of government, of serving people and engaging with people, to be the better model.

2751
03:42:00,546 --> 03:42:03,028
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my position as an individual counselor.

2752
03:42:05,262 --> 03:42:16,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I strongly and firmly believe that while KP Law, I would be fine with KP Law at $138,000 if it also meant a city solicitor at $160,000 and an assistant city solicitor at a competitive salary.

2753
03:42:16,425 --> 03:42:17,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I got no problem with that.

2754
03:42:17,365 --> 03:42:19,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I respect KP Law's specialty and expertise.

2755
03:42:21,266 --> 03:42:30,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think that there's a fundamental difference between an outsourced legal counsel and an in-house person dedicated to the city of Medford all the time.

2756
03:42:32,009 --> 03:42:33,509
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that it would,

2757
03:42:35,438 --> 03:42:43,221
[SPEAKER_05]: make our job as a council as a body easier to know that we're going to have to build that relationship.

2758
03:42:43,321 --> 03:42:45,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time we're writing an ordinance, we talk to a different person.

2759
03:42:46,303 --> 03:42:47,963
[SPEAKER_05]: We have different conversations.

2760
03:42:48,023 --> 03:42:48,924
[SPEAKER_05]: We have

2761
03:42:50,000 --> 03:42:53,723
[SPEAKER_05]: an hour long disagreement because we don't understand each other's communication style.

2762
03:42:53,983 --> 03:43:00,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just, it comes down to like these very personal and, and, but also very tangible realities.

2763
03:43:00,548 --> 03:43:02,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry about that.

2764
03:43:03,250 --> 03:43:05,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why my phone is ringing at me.

2765
03:43:06,513 --> 03:43:08,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm probably telling me I need to go to bed.

2766
03:43:10,216 --> 03:43:16,181
[SPEAKER_05]: But in any case, it's just, it, it,

2767
03:43:17,563 --> 03:43:23,152
[SPEAKER_05]: It is serving this purpose well enough for us to get work done, but it is not making it easy for us to excel.

2768
03:43:23,392 --> 03:43:28,520
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that has been my experience now in my third term.

2769
03:43:28,800 --> 03:43:32,146
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really, I certainly don't think that the more

2770
03:43:33,530 --> 03:43:42,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Drastic course suggested is something that we should move towards to say remove this city solicitor position because that'll save another 100,000 for the schools.

2771
03:43:42,152 --> 03:43:47,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to find real sustainable long term solutions and on that question.

2772
03:43:49,734 --> 03:43:52,335
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also just think in principle that this is just not the.

2773
03:43:53,248 --> 03:44:00,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly not the approach that the council would want, even though I can respect what you're saying that under the current charter, the solicitor reports to the mayor.

2774
03:44:01,595 --> 03:44:10,562
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just think that that role in my experience and my conversations with counselors for many terms of my conversations with people who held the position of solicitor in the past.

2775
03:44:11,519 --> 03:44:25,592
[SPEAKER_05]: And in my conversations, as I said, with members of the legal team that we hired to do the solicitor's job right now, there's a lot of value to having that position filled and building that in-house knowledge and interpersonal relationship.

2776
03:44:25,712 --> 03:44:28,455
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think we're solving it tonight.

2777
03:44:29,275 --> 03:44:30,136
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a preliminary meeting.

2778
03:44:30,196 --> 03:44:32,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that point is incredibly well taken.

2779
03:44:34,246 --> 03:44:36,767
[SPEAKER_05]: haven't seen the budget yet, so maybe we'll get somewhere different than this.

2780
03:44:37,548 --> 03:44:46,493
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm glad that we had this conversation now versus having this be a conversation in the middle of June where motions are made that none of us want to make or like.

2781
03:44:46,693 --> 03:44:49,374
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll leave that for another day.

2782
03:44:49,794 --> 03:44:52,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion on this item, and I will allow you to respond.

2783
03:44:53,775 --> 03:44:55,117
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have much else to say.

2784
03:44:55,137 --> 03:45:03,308
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the only other thing that I would say, and it was a point you made earlier, President Behrs, as to the unorthodox, I think you called it unorthodox.

2785
03:45:03,428 --> 03:45:03,909
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

2786
03:45:03,929 --> 03:45:05,571
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I can't speak to

2787
03:45:07,537 --> 03:45:21,003
[SPEAKER_14]: perspectives, but, you know, and I can, what I can tell you is I've worked for a number of communities, form of governments were different, but, you know, outside legal counsel is not necessarily unorthodox across the Commonwealth.

2788
03:45:22,264 --> 03:45:33,549
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I don't know what the comparative is, but I just, I don't feel that there's, I wouldn't, by no means am I suggesting that there was anything stated tonight that I think has been

2789
03:45:36,857 --> 03:45:59,813
[SPEAKER_14]: uh unfair or otherwise but I think historically there have been comments by you know maybe former city councillors as to the intent or otherwise the the nature of or the the um just just bad information misinformation has been stated in the past about this this topic and I'm not saying any councillors uh

2790
03:46:01,135 --> 03:46:09,662
[SPEAKER_14]: on this council have said any of those things, but I'm really not saying that, but I think former councillors have made points that have confused the situation.

2791
03:46:09,722 --> 03:46:16,727
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just wanna say that I don't think it's an unorthodox style, but I haven't studied the matter across the Commonwealth.

2792
03:46:16,767 --> 03:46:23,332
[SPEAKER_14]: I can just tell you that there's a number of communities that do utilize the support of outside council.

2793
03:46:23,812 --> 03:46:25,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely, and I agree with that.

2794
03:46:25,594 --> 03:46:27,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that as you just said, most of them are towns.

2795
03:46:28,476 --> 03:46:29,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not aware of a city that does it,

2796
03:46:30,852 --> 03:46:37,437
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was the point that the person I was, and I'm not quoting them and saying unorthodox, that's my description of their words.

2797
03:46:37,917 --> 03:46:39,898
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, this model presents a city solicitor.

2798
03:46:39,958 --> 03:46:41,419
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just point that out.

2799
03:46:41,499 --> 03:46:42,760
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know you acknowledge that.

2800
03:46:42,960 --> 03:46:43,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And it does.

2801
03:46:43,441 --> 03:46:44,301
[SPEAKER_05]: No, and that's very true.

2802
03:46:44,361 --> 03:46:49,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't, you know, it sounded like taking it was an option.

2803
03:46:51,372 --> 03:47:00,839
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, I was asked to state to the council what the mayor, how the mayor would do this, given what we've seen in terms of demand and product.

2804
03:47:01,239 --> 03:47:02,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that, thank you.

2805
03:47:02,900 --> 03:47:10,145
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, you know, I don't think we're solving it tonight, but I think all of our opinions have been stated clearly.

2806
03:47:10,185 --> 03:47:11,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anyone else have any comments?

2807
03:47:13,867 --> 03:47:18,290
[SPEAKER_05]: There's literally no one else in the Zoom and no one else in the room, so I won't even ask for the public comment.

2808
03:47:18,590 --> 03:47:19,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to adjourn.

2809
03:47:19,771 --> 03:47:20,512
[SPEAKER_14]: Where did they all go?

2810
03:47:21,385 --> 03:47:30,342
[SPEAKER_05]: on the motion to report the questions from the committee tonight to the administration and to adjourn by Councillor Lemming, seconded by Councillor Lozano.

2811
03:47:30,483 --> 03:47:31,084
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favour?
