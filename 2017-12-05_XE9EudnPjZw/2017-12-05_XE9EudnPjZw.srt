68
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:56,099

00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:57,879

[SPEAKER_19]: There is none.

73
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:16,177
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it your wish that I should present them?

74
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:18,239
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

75
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:20,821
[SPEAKER_19]: So this was the committee of the whole of November 13th.

76
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:21,942
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

77
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,543
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we need to hear me?

78
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:25,304
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

79
00:02:30,008 --> 00:02:36,754
[SPEAKER_19]: And present at the meeting were Mayor Burke, Vice Chair Anne Marie Cuno, Arenda Benedetto, Kathy Kreatz, Mia Mustone, Robert Scurry and myself.

80
00:02:37,214 --> 00:02:40,878
[SPEAKER_19]: Also attending was Michael Ruggiero and Paul Rousseau, school committee members elect.

[SPEAKER_19]: Principal, Paul DeLeva.

[SPEAKER_19]: Athletic Trainer, Tanya Cashman.

[SPEAKER_19]: Tim Zitt.

92
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:27,131
[SPEAKER_19]: Registrar, Curtis Tudin, and other community members, including Tammy Simonotis, Marie Petrides, Angela Moore, David Lu, Melanie McLaughlin, Tanya Sullivan, and Jameel Webb Davis.

93
00:03:27,512 --> 00:03:30,174
[SPEAKER_19]: Transcript recorder Miranda Wilson was also in attendance.

94
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:41,310
[SPEAKER_19]: The meeting was called to discuss school brains, the field trip policy, follow up on student concussions, and report on the North Medford bus.

95
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,034
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a very substantial meeting, went on for hours.

96
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:46,017
[SPEAKER_19]: I just added that.

97
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:49,478
[SPEAKER_19]: Superintendent Dawson made the following remarks.

98
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:54,400
[SPEAKER_19]: The evenings, and by the way, sorry, there was a mistake.

99
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,121
[SPEAKER_19]: It should be Bernadette Riccadeli.

100
00:03:57,441 --> 00:03:59,202
[SPEAKER_19]: So we addressed the four different issues.

101
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:04,504
[SPEAKER_19]: And the first item was the report of the North Medford bus capacity and ridership.

102
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:10,006
[SPEAKER_19]: Director of Administration and Finance, Christine Patterson, gave this report and it's attached.

103
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:11,887
[SPEAKER_19]: And principal,

104
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:14,607
[SPEAKER_19]: Tucci verified the report.

105
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:23,749
[SPEAKER_19]: There are two buses coming from North Medford in the morning, and in the afternoon, there are between 45 to 50 riders daily, which is within its capacity.

106
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:26,370
[SPEAKER_19]: At this time, there's no need to add another bus.

107
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,511
[SPEAKER_19]: Administration will keep the committee informed as demand increases.

108
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:33,511
[SPEAKER_19]: The next item was student concussions.

109
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:35,792
[SPEAKER_19]: We talked about this at length.

110
00:04:37,253 --> 00:04:42,958
[SPEAKER_19]: As part of our discussions, parent Tammy Simonotis spoke of her son's experience at Beverly High School.

111
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:50,244
[SPEAKER_19]: She asserted that her son was injured during a JV soccer game and that there was inadequate trainer medical coverage by the Beverly staff.

112
00:04:50,764 --> 00:04:53,887
[SPEAKER_19]: She believes that the Beverly schools did not have a certified trainer at the game.

113
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,990
[SPEAKER_19]: Her son suffered a head injury, chipped teeth, and nosebleeds.

114
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,792
[SPEAKER_19]: The concern focused upon safety at away games.

115
00:05:03,523 --> 00:05:10,769
[SPEAKER_19]: Members of our staff spoke with the athletic director at Beverly, but really haven't received any more news.

116
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:18,775
[SPEAKER_19]: Mrs. Simone was pleased with how Medford handles injuries, but was very upset at the Beverly response.

117
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:25,901
[SPEAKER_19]: Concern was particularly high because the game was allowed to go on after the injury took place.

118
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:31,525
[SPEAKER_19]: The superintendent promised that he will be conferring with the MIAA regarding this matter.

119
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:41,772
[SPEAKER_19]: The next item under discussion was the field trip policy, and Administrators Paul DeLiva, Tony Vento, and Kathy Medaglio contributed comments during the discussions.

120
00:05:43,072 --> 00:05:50,757
[SPEAKER_19]: CPAC Chairperson Melanie McLaughlin raised equity issues about the policy and commented that CPAC should have been consulted as the policy was formulated.

121
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:58,704
[SPEAKER_19]: There was a discussion about the annual trip to New York by the Andrew School and the questions about deadlines.

122
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:12,057
[SPEAKER_19]: And among the 90 students who attended, there were 19 students who either had an IEP or 504 plan, and this was 19% of the participants.

123
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,224
[SPEAKER_19]: If we had added another bus, it would have cost approximately 7,500 and would not have made the trip doable.

124
00:06:21,205 --> 00:06:21,365
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

125
00:06:21,385 --> 00:06:28,851
[SPEAKER_19]: McLaughlin asserted that the trip excluded students with disabilities and that every trip should be planned to serve all interested students.

126
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:30,813
[SPEAKER_19]: The issue raised several points.

127
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:36,040
[SPEAKER_19]: Can field trips be planned with application deadlines if those deadlines are applicable to all students?

128
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:39,725
[SPEAKER_19]: Should field trips be limited if the economics cannot be balanced?

129
00:06:40,186 --> 00:06:44,832
[SPEAKER_19]: And should the cost of medical services be shared by all participants or subsidized by the school system?

130
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:47,775
[SPEAKER_19]: After continued discussion, the policy was tabled.

131
00:06:47,795 --> 00:06:51,017
[SPEAKER_19]: Administrators will bring forward a revised policy that addresses the issues.

132
00:06:51,718 --> 00:06:53,760
[SPEAKER_19]: The final issue of the evening was school brains.

133
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,725
[SPEAKER_19]: Headmaster Perella and Data Information Specialist Registrar Curtis Tudin gave us a report.

134
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:06,890
[SPEAKER_19]: The headmaster reported that changes had been made to address the GPA concerns raised during the spring by Mr. David Lu.

135
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:11,134
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Tudin provided a chart that showed the increase in usage by parents and teachers.

136
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:13,016
[SPEAKER_19]: More will be done going forward.

137
00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:15,438
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a work in progress, but it is moving forward.

138
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:19,262
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Liu was still skeptical about the accuracy of the reporting system.

139
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:22,385
[SPEAKER_19]: He revisited his concerns from last spring.

140
00:07:22,805 --> 00:07:24,987
[SPEAKER_19]: Administrators asserted that the changes would work.

141
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:27,910
[SPEAKER_19]: The school committee asked to be informed as the year progressed.

142
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:29,932
[SPEAKER_19]: The meeting was adjourned at 10.05.

143
00:07:30,153 --> 00:07:32,295
[SPEAKER_19]: Respectfully submitted, Paulette Vanderkoot, Secretary.

144
00:07:32,955 --> 00:07:33,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good, thank you, Ms.

145
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:34,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Vandekloot.

146
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:35,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

147
00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:35,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Kreatz.

148
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:39,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Superintendent Belson, I just wanted to follow up with you.

149
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,003
[SPEAKER_10]: I was in touch with Ms.

150
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:49,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Simonettis and I just wanted to know if something was filed with the MIAA regarding the incident, if you've had a chance to file that yet.

151
00:07:50,876 --> 00:07:55,057
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so I've had substantial contact with the Beverly Public Schools.

152
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:59,699
[SPEAKER_18]: They strongly dispute the account provided to us by Ms.

153
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:00,739
[SPEAKER_18]: Simonides.

154
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:04,580
[SPEAKER_18]: I've gone back and forth with Stephen Hershey, who is the superintendent there.

155
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:11,603
[SPEAKER_18]: He claims, and he gave me the name of the trainer, the certified trainer who was on the field at that time.

156
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:17,465
[SPEAKER_18]: He said that no trainer from Beverly did anything with the individual.

157
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:24,619
[SPEAKER_18]: As a result, he feels that it may have been somebody else who just simply helped out on the sidelines.

158
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,481
[SPEAKER_18]: So I have a lot more to do.

159
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:33,688
[SPEAKER_18]: I did contact the MIAA briefly and told them that we're in the process of continuing to investigate what actually took place.

160
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:41,636
[SPEAKER_18]: But there is a distinct difference of opinion between what Beverly feels happened and what was reported to us.

161
00:08:42,277 --> 00:08:47,304
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's a little bit going on right now, and I'll have more reports soon as I get a better chance to talk to all the parties.

162
00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:52,271
[SPEAKER_18]: The feeling from Beverly was that somebody assisted the student, but not necessarily the trainer.

163
00:08:54,952 --> 00:09:00,318
[SPEAKER_18]: the play was allowed to go forward without any reason to stop the play.

164
00:09:00,658 --> 00:09:14,174
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's back and forth, but Beverly strongly refutes the idea that their trainer assisted our student, and also that the trainer was not licensed, and they gave me the name and showed me the licensure.

165
00:09:14,938 --> 00:09:17,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you communicate that information to the parent?

166
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:18,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Not yet.

167
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:20,443
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, this is still going back.

168
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:22,746
[SPEAKER_18]: In fact, the latest communication was as late as today.

169
00:09:23,386 --> 00:09:24,227
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm Stephen Hershey.

170
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:27,170
[SPEAKER_18]: So I've got a lot more work to do.

171
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,173
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, obviously, there's a real difference of opinion in what took place.

172
00:09:30,973 --> 00:09:34,996
[SPEAKER_10]: So you got the name and the person is not certified?

173
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:35,596
[SPEAKER_10]: They are.

174
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:38,218
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually have it on my phone.

175
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:41,559
[SPEAKER_19]: I can give it to you afterwards.

176
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:53,346
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess that would raise the question to me is if our kids are playing and a student got hurt, why wasn't our student cared for by the trainer who was there?

177
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:56,068
[SPEAKER_18]: According to the Beverly Public Schools,

178
00:09:57,374 --> 00:10:00,977
[SPEAKER_18]: Since the referee didn't stop the play, obviously he didn't consider it serious enough.

179
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:08,523
[SPEAKER_18]: And that for some reason, the assistance was done on the sidelines.

180
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:14,188
[SPEAKER_18]: They suspect that somebody who maybe had a nursing background or something else like that may have helped on the sidelines.

181
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:18,051
[SPEAKER_18]: The question is, why did the youngster go back in the game too if he had a kick in the head?

182
00:10:18,391 --> 00:10:20,092
[SPEAKER_18]: There are a couple of questions that still have to be answered.

183
00:10:20,472 --> 00:10:29,696
[SPEAKER_19]: And if the student, I believe the parent, told us that the student was bleeding, so why would the, I mean, we already talked about why didn't the referee stop the game?

184
00:10:30,317 --> 00:10:34,399
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, well, according to them, they didn't believe the referee needed to stop the game.

185
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:40,762
[SPEAKER_18]: And secondly, you know, and without casting any aspersions on anyone, as you know, Mississimini's was not at the game.

186
00:10:41,342 --> 00:10:47,725
[SPEAKER_18]: And so as a result, we have a situation where people who were at the game have very different reports as to what took place there.

187
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:57,149
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, but certainly blood is blood and if well, that's that's you know, an assumption that was made as to when the bleeding took place and who did what and where and I need more information.

188
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,430
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, obviously, we have a back and forth going on.

189
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:09,718
[SPEAKER_18]: And I asked Stephen Hershey, who's the again, superintendent of Beverly, because Mississippi nineties was contacting the Beverly School Committee, and others up in Beverly.

190
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:10,499
[SPEAKER_18]: And

191
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,416
[SPEAKER_18]: they are siding with the Beverly Public Schools right now.

192
00:11:14,436 --> 00:11:18,098
[SPEAKER_18]: So I need a lot more feeling as to what's really took place.

193
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,138
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information, Mayor?

194
00:11:19,318 --> 00:11:19,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information.

195
00:11:19,998 --> 00:11:25,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Through you to the Superintendent, has the Game Officials Committee been contacted to find out who the referee was?

196
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,402
[SPEAKER_18]: I asked for that information, I haven't got it back yet.

197
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:31,323
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, have you spoke to the coach?

198
00:11:32,182 --> 00:11:33,863
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't speak to the coach, but Mr. Maloney did.

199
00:11:34,764 --> 00:11:36,345
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I'm gonna get a follow-up on that.

200
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:44,512
[SPEAKER_18]: But again, today's information, which I just got today, is a direct refutation of the story we got.

201
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:47,494
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I really need to ask a lot of questions.

202
00:11:47,654 --> 00:11:54,479
[SPEAKER_19]: Right, but we do have the student who this happened to, and we could have a follow-up with the student.

203
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,403
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I just don't know when it happened, how it happened, and the like.

204
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:01,125
[SPEAKER_18]: I have two very different reports.

205
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:03,055
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

206
00:12:03,075 --> 00:12:03,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Cugno.

207
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:19,114
[SPEAKER_08]: When you find out from Beverly, or when you continue discussions with Beverly, could you find out, were they filming the game to see, you know, what type of play happened out there, or was there anyone filming the game to see what type of...

208
00:12:20,295 --> 00:12:22,838
[SPEAKER_18]: I doubt they were filming the JV game.

209
00:12:22,978 --> 00:12:25,581
[SPEAKER_18]: They may have filmed the varsity game, but I doubt they filmed the JV game.

210
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:27,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, sometimes it depends on the schools.

211
00:12:27,903 --> 00:12:29,104
[SPEAKER_08]: They might do it if the kids.

212
00:12:29,344 --> 00:12:31,226
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be someone out there that just had their Facebook.

213
00:12:31,387 --> 00:12:34,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Not their Facebook, their cell phone and were filming too.

214
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to see what type of play and if there is something out there that at least we could see.

215
00:12:39,695 --> 00:12:44,977
[SPEAKER_08]: okay let me let me if I can mayor let me let me read you the latest communication from Stephen Hershey

216
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,983
[SPEAKER_18]: because I'm gonna put it on my cell phone, and it'll give you an idea of the strength of his comment.

217
00:13:09,463 --> 00:13:11,164
[SPEAKER_18]: It wasn't like, I don't think anything happened.

218
00:13:11,484 --> 00:13:13,725
[SPEAKER_18]: It was very, very direct.

219
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:15,927
[SPEAKER_18]: So let me read it to you.

220
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:23,110
[SPEAKER_15]: While you're getting that up, Mr. Tringali, our student representative, would like to ask a question.

221
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:23,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

222
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:31,215
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the danger behind concussions is the lack of education that goes with it, and especially on the part of the coaches.

223
00:13:32,844 --> 00:14:00,725
[SPEAKER_00]: and if the student does not know to take themselves out of the game they will put themselves at risk for a second damage to the brain which is far worse than the first, so possibly if we're thinking about our own education policy in the future and keeping our own kids safe I think this is a great example to show that we should push for Medford coaches to be

224
00:14:02,848 --> 00:14:04,290
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of concussions in the game.

225
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:27,189
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been six years since Michelle's been gone, so about six years ago, that everyone had to go through it.

226
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:43,098
[SPEAKER_08]: The ironic part is that actually I argued with the referee themselves, their organization, because there is a policy out there that everyone has to go through, and that is the coaches have to go through it, the administration has to go through it, the students have to go through it,

227
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:50,525
[SPEAKER_08]: have to go through it, and at that point in time, and of course, athletic directors had to go through it, nurses.

228
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:59,954
[SPEAKER_08]: The only ones at that point in time that didn't have to go through it were the referees, which I thought was completely ironic because they were the ones that called the game.

229
00:15:00,094 --> 00:15:05,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Fought long and hard enough, it finally came true, and the referees have also had to go through it.

230
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:21,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to give you a quick policy on that, when a student has a concussion, our athletic trainer actually, before the season begins, tests all our children, and there's a certain way of testing them through the concussion strategies that they have.

231
00:15:22,211 --> 00:15:30,577
[SPEAKER_08]: If by any chance a child does get hurt on the field, then that child has to go back to that trainer, gets evaluated, has to go to a doctor,

232
00:15:31,117 --> 00:15:39,500
[SPEAKER_08]: will not be placed on that field again, not only with the clearance of a doctor, not only with the clearance of the nurses, but also with the clearance of the trainer.

233
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:46,403
[SPEAKER_08]: And let me tell you, our trainer, she doesn't care which doctor clears you, you will not get on that field unless that trainer

234
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:52,304
[SPEAKER_08]: And, unfortunately, this was a situation that happened prior to that.

235
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:54,124
[SPEAKER_08]: It happened on the field.

236
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:59,265
[SPEAKER_08]: It happened away, you know, in experiences of, I'm going to say, on everyone.

237
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,246
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I understand that the student, the player wanted to get back.

238
00:16:02,846 --> 00:16:04,566
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it's like everything else.

239
00:16:04,586 --> 00:16:06,046
[SPEAKER_08]: The player always wants to get back.

240
00:16:06,226 --> 00:16:08,567
[SPEAKER_08]: But we as adults have to take responsibility, too.

241
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,007
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not blaming the coach.

242
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:11,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not blaming our team.

243
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:12,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not blaming anybody.

244
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:15,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying that there's certain things that we need to make decisions upon.

245
00:16:16,848 --> 00:16:18,330
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the superintendent is working with them.

246
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:28,379
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't want to draw any conclusions until I have more investigation, but let me read you what Stephen Hershey wrote me today, and then attach some additional information which I'm exploring with others.

247
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:29,861
[SPEAKER_18]: Good afternoon.

248
00:16:29,881 --> 00:16:31,642
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sending you copies of what I have in addition.

249
00:16:31,662 --> 00:16:33,524
[SPEAKER_18]: Your athletic director sent a letter to us.

250
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:37,047
[SPEAKER_18]: I spoke with several Beverly parents I know usually attend the games.

251
00:16:37,168 --> 00:16:41,352
[SPEAKER_18]: While some of them remember the play, they do not report it as a significant injury.

252
00:16:41,892 --> 00:16:44,895
[SPEAKER_18]: They note that there was no stoppage of play, nor the issuance of a card.

253
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:50,401
[SPEAKER_18]: Our trainer's name is Charla Berenas, and she has been with us for a long time without complaint.

254
00:16:50,881 --> 00:16:55,266
[SPEAKER_18]: Beverly has taken this seriously from the start, but I have been unable to verify what has been reported.

255
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:59,350
[SPEAKER_18]: Our coaches and trainer are expected to deal with potential concussions with great caution.

256
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:04,135
[SPEAKER_18]: We perform ongoing training to ensure we are attending to the safety of all athletes under our own

257
00:17:04,835 --> 00:17:06,116
[SPEAKER_18]: are players from other teams.

258
00:17:06,516 --> 00:17:07,677
[SPEAKER_18]: I would like to find out what happened.

259
00:17:07,717 --> 00:17:09,518
[SPEAKER_18]: Please forward me any information you have.

260
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,060
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have an ongoing investigation.

261
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:17,583
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't draw a conclusion without more discussion with people.

262
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:18,764
[SPEAKER_18]: This came through today.

263
00:17:19,485 --> 00:17:21,206
[SPEAKER_18]: And we've got a little bit more to follow up.

264
00:17:21,286 --> 00:17:27,650
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just don't want to draw conclusions until I'm comfortable that everyone has a chance to review the information back and forth.

265
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,512
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll mark it for a report, follow-up report on our agenda.

266
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:31,913
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

267
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:37,132
[SPEAKER_15]: And is there a motion to accept this committee of the whole report from November 13th?

268
00:17:37,232 --> 00:17:39,835
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, actually amended, because I was not present at this meeting.

269
00:17:40,055 --> 00:17:40,795
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, second.

270
00:17:41,356 --> 00:17:42,377
[SPEAKER_18]: And you can add me to the meeting.

271
00:17:42,397 --> 00:17:45,820
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice Chair Cugno.

272
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,460
[SPEAKER_15]: Add you to it?

273
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,262
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I was present.

274
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:50,423
Okay.

275
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:54,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion for acceptance of the report as amended?

276
00:17:54,226 --> 00:17:55,427
[SPEAKER_15]: So moved.

277
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:57,069
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

278
00:17:57,189 --> 00:17:57,910
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

279
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:58,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

280
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,291
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

281
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:00,692
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

282
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,061
[SPEAKER_15]: The Committee of the Whole from November 15th.

283
00:18:04,462 --> 00:18:06,003
[SPEAKER_15]: We do not have that report yet.

284
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:10,388
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd ask that one of my colleagues table this Committee of the Whole report.

285
00:18:10,448 --> 00:18:12,290
[SPEAKER_15]: So moved by Mr. Benedetto.

286
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

287
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:14,412
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

288
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:14,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

289
00:18:15,173 --> 00:18:15,794
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

290
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:16,935
[SPEAKER_15]: That paper is tabled.

291
00:18:17,616 --> 00:18:19,117
[SPEAKER_15]: Committee of the Whole minutes from November 27th, 2017.

292
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:31,553
[SPEAKER_15]: This was a meeting that we held last week in order to discuss the succession plan for our superintendent of schools.

293
00:18:31,573 --> 00:18:35,195
[SPEAKER_15]: We had the Mass Association of School Committees present.

294
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:41,818
[SPEAKER_15]: He presented quite a brochure to us on strategies that we should use in our deliberations.

295
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:47,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Ultimately, the Medford School Committee voted on the following matters in Committee of the Whole.

296
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:53,303
[SPEAKER_15]: that the MASC, Mass Associated School Committee, will provide a sample brochure to us.

297
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:58,044
[SPEAKER_15]: The school committee will also explore other search consultants before making a selection.

298
00:18:58,744 --> 00:19:01,285
[SPEAKER_15]: The school committee voted to review internal candidates first.

299
00:19:01,325 --> 00:19:02,585
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a seven to zero vote.

300
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:08,727
[SPEAKER_15]: And the school committee voted to meet again on December 11th, 2017 to continue its work.

301
00:19:09,427 --> 00:19:14,668
[SPEAKER_15]: We also had quite a bit of discussion around a search committee if we ultimately do go outside.

302
00:19:14,748 --> 00:19:17,729
[SPEAKER_15]: What was explained to us is if we do internal candidates,

303
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:21,612
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be school committee interviewing in a public session.

304
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:28,600
[SPEAKER_15]: If from there we go to a full search, a nationwide search, let's say, we would form a committee.

305
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:36,689
[SPEAKER_15]: And the complement of that committee would be set up of three teachers from the different levels of schooling.

306
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:47,116
[SPEAKER_15]: one administrator, one student, school committee members, suggested was three, and also community members being parents.

307
00:19:47,676 --> 00:19:55,061
[SPEAKER_15]: And we also wanted to make sure that we included all subgroups such as special ed and ELL in those check boxes.

308
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:57,082
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're working on an actual application.

309
00:19:57,482 --> 00:20:02,986
[SPEAKER_15]: For those out there, we're working on a formal application that people can fill out and submit back to us if they have an interest.

310
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:06,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, I ask that our diversity director be a member of this committee.

311
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:10,828
[SPEAKER_15]: It was voted on in a seven to zero, so thank you all for that.

312
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:14,628
[SPEAKER_15]: And we will be meeting next week to discuss this further on December 11th.

313
00:20:15,008 --> 00:20:16,389
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Superintendent, is that up here?

314
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:17,389
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

315
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:18,709
[SPEAKER_15]: That is in the high school.

316
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:19,769
[SPEAKER_18]: It will be in the conference room.

317
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

318
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,811
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to accept the report and place it on file.

319
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:27,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to accept by Mr. Gugno, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

320
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:28,511
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

321
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:29,131
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

322
00:20:29,372 --> 00:20:30,112
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

323
00:20:30,232 --> 00:20:30,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

324
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:33,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Community participation, Ms.

325
00:20:33,886 --> 00:20:36,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Retta Smith regarding the school breakfast program.

326
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:38,515
[SPEAKER_15]: Mia, did you want to say a few words or no?

327
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:39,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Go Retta.

328
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:40,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Go Retta.

329
00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:47,164
[SPEAKER_18]: You've been handed a report tonight that was sent to us.

330
00:20:47,184 --> 00:20:54,070
[SPEAKER_15]: So on our desk is a report on the 2017 breakfast participation rates as well as some literature.

331
00:20:55,851 --> 00:20:56,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening everyone.

332
00:20:57,613 --> 00:21:01,837
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was asked to present some information on the school breakfast program.

333
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:06,801
[SPEAKER_11]: So I am a registered dietitian and I am the nutritionist for the food services department.

334
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:08,862
[SPEAKER_11]: for Medford Public Schools.

335
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:13,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Just some general information, we offer breakfast at all of our schools.

336
00:21:13,945 --> 00:21:19,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of them, it's traditional style offered before school begins in the cafeteria.

337
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:24,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Three of them offer breakfast free of charge for any student interested.

338
00:21:25,473 --> 00:21:33,538
[SPEAKER_11]: One of those three has breakfast not in the cafeteria before school, but in the classroom after the bell, and it counts as learning time.

339
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:49,464
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you look at the sheet that has the breakfast participation rates, if you look at the last column, the percent ADP, so the percentage of average daily participation, it ranges from 0% to 86 almost percent.

340
00:21:50,164 --> 00:21:55,447
[SPEAKER_11]: So this really shows the drastic variance in participation rates.

341
00:21:55,967 --> 00:22:02,590
[SPEAKER_11]: So the Columbus, the McGlynn Elementary and Middle School all are offering universally free breakfasts.

342
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:17,920
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you take a look at just those three, using the October 2017 data, the McGlynn Elementary School had almost 29% participation, the middle school was almost 21, and the Columbus was at about 86.

343
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:26,805
[SPEAKER_11]: So the Columbus is the school that offers breakfast in the classroom for everyone, so you can see the difference that that really makes in the participation rates.

344
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:29,687
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is not something that is unique

345
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:38,554
[SPEAKER_11]: to our district, the EOS Foundation, which is a non-profit organization that really promotes school breakfast being offered after the bell.

346
00:22:38,754 --> 00:22:50,563
[SPEAKER_11]: They have seen this statewide that schools offering free breakfasts in a traditional setting before the bell experience participation rates far lower than those who offer it in the classroom.

347
00:22:51,824 --> 00:22:56,167
[SPEAKER_15]: Could you explain why the Columbus offers it after the bell versus the others before?

348
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,301
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's a good question.

349
00:22:58,381 --> 00:23:05,486
[SPEAKER_11]: The McGlynn Middle School, this is its first year instituting the universal, so I don't know what the decision was there.

350
00:23:05,546 --> 00:23:12,592
[SPEAKER_11]: The elementary school, from what I'm told a few years ago, I think this was before I started working here, there was a rodent issue.

351
00:23:12,752 --> 00:23:20,638
[SPEAKER_11]: They originally started off doing a breakfast in the class model, and there was a rodent issue that was attributed to the breakfast program, so they stopped.

352
00:23:21,113 --> 00:23:25,577
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Mr. Superintendent, are the principals deciding whether it's before or after the bell?

353
00:23:25,757 --> 00:23:26,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much, yeah.

354
00:23:26,478 --> 00:23:26,898
[SPEAKER_15]: Pretty much?

355
00:23:27,118 --> 00:23:27,278
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

356
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:29,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we ask them to all reevaluate?

357
00:23:30,261 --> 00:23:30,501
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

358
00:23:32,422 --> 00:23:32,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

359
00:23:32,803 --> 00:23:34,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Would that be a recommendation you'd make?

360
00:23:34,364 --> 00:23:41,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that was my, I just wanted to have you consider this information and questions of universal breakfast going forward.

361
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,752
[SPEAKER_18]: It's probably another factor, too, in terms of busing.

362
00:23:43,772 --> 00:23:46,774
[SPEAKER_18]: The more busing that takes place, the less likely they are to arrive.

363
00:23:48,663 --> 00:23:51,171
[SPEAKER_18]: take it before the actual school starts.

364
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:54,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, right, yes, yeah, that has a big impact in participation as well, yeah.

365
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:55,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Benedetto?

366
00:23:56,253 --> 00:23:57,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

367
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:02,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you tell me what the percentage of the forms returned are for each building, do you know that?

368
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,099
[SPEAKER_11]: So the free and reduced eligibility?

369
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:11,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, whether they sign that they need it or they return the form saying that they're not eligible but they have to sign their form.

370
00:24:12,345 --> 00:24:15,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Does every student sign have a form returned?

371
00:24:15,908 --> 00:24:17,389
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's voluntary.

372
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:20,491
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do we get two parents that

373
00:24:22,423 --> 00:24:45,816
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know what this is, and it's coming home, and they're not knowing to turn them back in, and get the quote we need, because that would, you know, that would change a lot, and do parents know that this also reflects in whether or not they pay for SAT exams, as well as college applications, if they reduce lunch, has bigger implications other than just foods on a daily basis.

374
00:24:46,256 --> 00:25:01,906
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think, like up at the high school you might not get any kids learning forms, but if they knew that that was tied in and there was like a campaign to really educate people throughout the community, I think that our numbers could actually be higher than what they're listed here.

375
00:25:01,926 --> 00:25:02,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

376
00:25:03,227 --> 00:25:13,655
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's concerning to me and I think we have to have like almost 100% return rate per building and like really make it like a campaign or part of re-registration at each year.

377
00:25:14,455 --> 00:25:23,382
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way we are making sure we capture hungry families as well as giving all those alternative processes.

378
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:26,825
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would really like to know how many forms were returned.

379
00:25:27,846 --> 00:25:36,493
[SPEAKER_03]: per school, like broken down by school, as well as a plan for outreach for next year, so that way we are reaching every family.

380
00:25:36,553 --> 00:25:39,455
[SPEAKER_03]: They either sign off yes or they sign off no.

381
00:25:40,176 --> 00:25:47,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's a big job and a big undertaking, but I think it's well worth it in the community, because I don't think people especially,

382
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:57,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'd like to comment on that that we have engaged and made sure that we have the free and reduced applications in multiple languages they are returned and

383
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,682
[SPEAKER_04]: There is not a requirement for them to be returned.

384
00:26:10,742 --> 00:26:12,463
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a forced item.

385
00:26:12,523 --> 00:26:19,947
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we are capturing more free and reduced qualifications because they are incorporated within the portal.

386
00:26:20,248 --> 00:26:22,109
[SPEAKER_04]: So we automatically draw those down.

387
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:26,471
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not necessary that we receive an actual form back from every household.

388
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:29,153
[SPEAKER_04]: We are gathering those and getting those counts.

389
00:26:29,973 --> 00:26:38,700
[SPEAKER_04]: regardless through the portals that have, that's why we've encouraged additional services and we've had outreach with our parent information center.

390
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:50,550
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are providing much more detailed information and encouraging families to participate in these other systems that will provide them additional resources and then also

391
00:26:51,302 --> 00:26:53,963
[SPEAKER_04]: automatically qualify them for free or reduced.

392
00:26:54,703 --> 00:27:00,465
[SPEAKER_03]: And my point too is sometimes there's awards for 100% return rate for classes.

393
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:09,549
[SPEAKER_03]: They get really getting the word out and being a campaign so that the word goes home and people are excited and learning about it because they don't pay attention to every form.

394
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:12,010
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's so important to feed our children.

395
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:18,392
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's so important for kids that say, oh, we don't have money for our college applications.

396
00:27:18,452 --> 00:27:19,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not applying.

397
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:34,507
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the tests are covered and the applications are cheaper and like it's so many, many more aspects of this as well as our district could receive more federal funding because of our percentage rates.

398
00:27:35,047 --> 00:27:37,089
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just a suggestion.

399
00:27:37,129 --> 00:27:39,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I made it maybe last year as well.

400
00:27:40,301 --> 00:27:42,182
[SPEAKER_18]: So let me just make one clarification.

401
00:27:42,222 --> 00:27:43,543
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the breakfast program.

402
00:27:43,823 --> 00:27:47,285
[SPEAKER_18]: This is not the total numbers of students on free and reduced.

403
00:27:48,546 --> 00:27:53,088
[SPEAKER_18]: Not everybody comes in early enough for breakfast, especially at the high school and places like that.

404
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:57,211
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll give you a report with the total numbers, because they're much higher.

405
00:27:57,911 --> 00:28:06,313
[SPEAKER_18]: when you look at the school lunch program as opposed to the breakfast program, which is a more, let's say, niche program that not everybody participates in.

406
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:11,954
[SPEAKER_18]: It's one that we'd like to increase, and we've talked to Andrea Silbert over at EOS many times.

407
00:28:13,674 --> 00:28:18,335
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think that the breakfast program doesn't give you a full accurate picture.

408
00:28:18,395 --> 00:28:24,897
[SPEAKER_18]: If just at the high school alone, the number of youngsters who are in free and reduced, who don't pay a user fee for athletics, would tell you that it's much higher than this.

409
00:28:25,657 --> 00:28:45,363
[SPEAKER_19]: okay so we'll give you that we'll give you that report I noticed that the Tufts alternative school has a very low participation yeah this really surprised me because I would think it would almost be the natural environment for

410
00:28:45,543 --> 00:28:48,805
[SPEAKER_19]: where kids would be coming in and might pick up some breakfast at school.

411
00:28:48,906 --> 00:28:50,407
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you have any insight into that number?

412
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:52,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was really surprised by that also.

413
00:28:52,948 --> 00:29:02,415
[SPEAKER_11]: So we contacted Mr. Toomey over there, and he said that because they're allowed to come in so much later that most of them just eat before they come in.

414
00:29:02,956 --> 00:29:06,779
[SPEAKER_11]: And they can ask for breakfast, but they don't.

415
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:15,185
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do think that that's definitely an area of opportunity, especially if you could offer a breakfast that might be an incentive for students to come in.

416
00:29:15,689 --> 00:29:17,189
[SPEAKER_05]: get them there a little earlier.

417
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:17,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

418
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:23,831
[SPEAKER_19]: And the other thing I noticed is most of the schools we see an increase between September and October.

419
00:29:24,251 --> 00:29:37,655
[SPEAKER_19]: There was only one school where there was a slight decline and I'm just want to make sure that we we keep on looking at these numbers because I wouldn't want there to be any stigma attached to kids going in for breakfast.

420
00:29:37,915 --> 00:29:39,095
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why I think the classroom is

421
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:41,376
[SPEAKER_19]: environment really is ideal.

422
00:29:43,097 --> 00:29:56,245
[SPEAKER_19]: And if it works at the Columbus, maybe if we could talk to some of the principals and ask another one to try it for a month and see how it goes, just to see what kind of participation we have then.

423
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:56,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

424
00:29:57,305 --> 00:30:08,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I know for the past two years in a row, the Eos Foundation has awarded the Columbus a Healthy Start Award, and they give those to schools that see breakfast participation rates

425
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:13,595
[SPEAKER_11]: at 80% and higher for so many consecutive months over the course of a year.

426
00:30:13,655 --> 00:30:16,677
[SPEAKER_11]: So their average is over 80% year long.

427
00:30:16,697 --> 00:30:19,299
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.

428
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:29,065
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion by Mr. Benedetto, and also I ask that the superintendent reach out to the various principals to determine if they could do after the bell breakfast.

429
00:30:29,845 --> 00:30:31,166
[SPEAKER_15]: On that motion, all those in favor?

430
00:30:31,526 --> 00:30:31,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

431
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:32,667
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

432
00:30:32,907 --> 00:30:33,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

433
00:30:34,048 --> 00:30:34,868
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Ms.

434
00:30:34,888 --> 00:30:35,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Smith.

435
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:43,635
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to make a motion to suspend the order of business so that we can take up the report on student survey on substance abuse.

436
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,877
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a motion for suspension of the rules.

437
00:30:45,997 --> 00:30:47,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Ms.

438
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:48,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Cugno.

439
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:48,879
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

440
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:49,359
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

441
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,520
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

442
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

443
00:30:54,464 --> 00:31:06,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Before our nutritionist leaves, I saw on some social media that the Columbus School was talking about maybe sour milk and some of the things and asked that they just look into that.

444
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:16,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw on some social media about, at the McGlen and definitely at the Columbus, I saw some posts about children not taking the milk because they felt the milk was sour.

445
00:31:17,245 --> 00:31:24,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yes we are aware of that and I guess what I can say in response to that is we handle the milks appropriately.

446
00:31:25,271 --> 00:31:33,518
[SPEAKER_11]: We use a first in first out rotation system so the the oldest milks you know are the first ones that are in the coolers and leaving.

447
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:45,447
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean all of the refrigerators are keeping at temp so I think this might potentially be a supplier issue so we'll have to

448
00:31:47,434 --> 00:32:00,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but what I can say is from our handling of everything, we're doing everything that we can to ensure that the milks are are at a safe temperature and they are within the best by date.

449
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:01,281
[SPEAKER_11]: So they should be.

450
00:32:01,881 --> 00:32:02,482
[SPEAKER_11]: They should be good.

451
00:32:03,842 --> 00:32:05,563
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have to figure out why they're not.

452
00:32:06,323 --> 00:32:09,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Would you like to school committee elect?

453
00:32:09,605 --> 00:32:11,086
[SPEAKER_15]: Would you like to step up to the mic, please?

454
00:32:11,126 --> 00:32:11,346
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

455
00:32:11,366 --> 00:32:13,307
[SPEAKER_15]: I just had a question about.

456
00:32:14,167 --> 00:32:14,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

457
00:32:14,488 --> 00:32:14,988
[SPEAKER_15]: Through the chair.

458
00:32:17,585 --> 00:32:27,507
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a question about whether the in-class breakfast, how is the milk transported to the classes and how long does it sit in the classes and come back and over and over multiple times a day?

459
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:32,808
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you track that the milk isn't the same milk going to the class for four or five days in a row?

460
00:32:33,428 --> 00:32:37,048
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it actually kept cold while it's sitting in the class for an hour or two?

461
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:38,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

462
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:40,769
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is for the breakfast in the classroom?

463
00:32:40,869 --> 00:32:41,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

464
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:45,210
[SPEAKER_11]: So the breakfast items are transported in coolers.

465
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,552
[SPEAKER_11]: And they leave that morning and go.

466
00:32:48,852 --> 00:32:52,714
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know what the exact time frame is, but they're kept in coolers.

467
00:32:52,734 --> 00:32:55,836
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they are used probably, I would say, within an hour.

468
00:32:56,336 --> 00:32:59,038
[SPEAKER_11]: And any of the milks that come back are discarded.

469
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:03,340
[SPEAKER_11]: So that should not be contributing to the issue.

470
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:05,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

471
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:13,458
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, item four, based on suspension of the rules, report on student survey on substance abuse.

472
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,019
[SPEAKER_15]: We have with us Ms.

473
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:21,045
[SPEAKER_15]: Penny Funny-Elite from Medford City Hall Team Medford to do a presentation.

474
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,527
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you need us to move at all, Penny?

475
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:23,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

476
00:33:24,247 --> 00:33:26,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just turn on this projector and we shall see.

477
00:33:37,618 --> 00:33:55,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so thank you for having me today.

478
00:33:55,386 --> 00:34:01,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here to present the data, but I do not do my work alone, and Tony Vento and Rachel Perry are here.

479
00:34:02,213 --> 00:34:09,920
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk about the work that they do in the schools that really support youth substance use and prevention of youth substance use in the city.

480
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:15,705
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to say this is a report on a survey called the Community Care Survey.

481
00:34:15,725 --> 00:34:17,966
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been doing this survey since 2005.

482
00:34:19,007 --> 00:34:20,268
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done every two years.

483
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:27,655
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a long amount of years to see trends that have changed throughout the time of the city.

484
00:34:28,597 --> 00:34:37,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some of the things to note are that what it looks at is it looks at risk and protective factors, as well as frequency of reported use.

485
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,483
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this is, the youth take this survey.

486
00:34:40,084 --> 00:34:41,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's an anonymous survey.

487
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:43,045
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes back to us.

488
00:34:43,105 --> 00:34:49,229
[SPEAKER_02]: We send it to, excuse me, it goes from the school directly to the, uh, the researcher who cleans the data.

489
00:34:49,729 --> 00:34:56,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, by cleaning the data, what I mean is that they eliminate any surveys that exaggerate drug use.

490
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:59,255
[SPEAKER_02]: or any other antisocial behavior.

491
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:10,866
[SPEAKER_02]: They eliminate surveys where students report a fictitious drug that's on there, and then anything that's logically inconsistent patterns of drug use, they will eliminate those surveys.

492
00:35:11,207 --> 00:35:19,174
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say they had 100 that were not, you know, valid, they will eliminate those that will not be included in the total count for the survey itself.

493
00:35:21,315 --> 00:35:39,460
[SPEAKER_02]: But what it's doing is it's looking at—we don't ask questions about sexuality, but what risk and protective factors do is that really show what drives young people to do things that are risky for—so that's why we're looking at this larger picture snapshot.

494
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:45,161
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of communities use a youth risk behavior survey, and it really looks at the frequency.

495
00:35:45,461 --> 00:35:48,242
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look at some of the community conditions.

496
00:35:48,682 --> 00:35:51,264
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's a large report.

497
00:35:51,344 --> 00:35:52,744
[SPEAKER_02]: We've broken it up for you.

498
00:35:52,904 --> 00:36:06,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, we're going to talk just about substance abuse rates, and then I will come back, if I'm correct, Superintendent Belson, we discussed that I would come back, talk about risk and protective factors, and then come back again and talk about more data that we saw in the survey.

499
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:17,234
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm doing here by showing you this presentation is that I think that we need to remember that this is not a school problem.

500
00:36:17,395 --> 00:36:23,501
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a societal, family, peer-level, individual-level issue.

501
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:29,068
[SPEAKER_02]: And to solve anything that we want to see change on these numbers, we really need to be working as

502
00:36:29,428 --> 00:36:31,549
[SPEAKER_02]: as a whole, as a team to be able to do this.

503
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:41,194
[SPEAKER_02]: The school over the years, I've been here since 2008, I began in September 2008 doing this work, and the schools have had tremendous involvement.

504
00:36:41,454 --> 00:36:46,056
[SPEAKER_02]: The police department has had tremendous involvement in the work that we've done through the Board of Health.

505
00:36:47,537 --> 00:36:52,039
[SPEAKER_02]: And we put out many, many, many instances of putting information out to parents

506
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:55,984
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have not had public forums where parents come out in droves.

507
00:36:56,024 --> 00:37:01,692
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not that we wish they could get the information that we're putting out there.

508
00:37:01,732 --> 00:37:05,998
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of our urges here tonight is to say to parents, please pay attention.

509
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,621
[SPEAKER_02]: We are doing prevention.

510
00:37:08,061 --> 00:37:09,543
[SPEAKER_02]: education for you.

511
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:11,344
[SPEAKER_02]: We have resources for you.

512
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:16,569
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to be thinking about substance use prevention long before someone uses substances.

513
00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:24,997
[SPEAKER_02]: We're fortunate now in the City of Medford at the Board of Health to have an outreach worker or recovery coach who will

514
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:30,018
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, between the two of us, we sit and come up with a plan and work with individuals at the police department.

515
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:45,482
[SPEAKER_02]: We do an early intervention program where if youth are found drinking or using drugs, we will bring them in for a three-hour education course, give them a screening to see if they themselves have any issues, and then we will speak directly to their families about getting them help.

516
00:37:45,822 --> 00:37:52,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're really pushing that, you know, this is about getting help and getting this solved before it becomes a chronic issue for you and your family.

517
00:37:53,568 --> 00:37:56,693
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have these resources available.

518
00:37:56,733 --> 00:38:00,319
[SPEAKER_02]: We are begging you to come out to our presentations and or

519
00:38:00,942 --> 00:38:03,063
[SPEAKER_02]: access this information online.

520
00:38:04,203 --> 00:38:11,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Many programs for parents are going to be going up on the Mystic Valley Public Health website coming up soon.

521
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:16,469
[SPEAKER_02]: That will be linked to the city of Medford's website and hopefully to the school's website and to the police's website.

522
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:22,631
[SPEAKER_02]: But in today, if you have an issue and this is a televised, so I'm talking to the public.

523
00:38:23,572 --> 00:38:26,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Please go to drugfree.org and look for information there.

524
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:28,354
[SPEAKER_02]: They can they can steer you in the right direction.

525
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:34,518
[SPEAKER_02]: So the survey itself, we're looking at three different measures of use rates.

526
00:38:34,598 --> 00:38:36,780
[SPEAKER_02]: We have lifetime use, so have you ever tried a substance?

527
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:50,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Experimentation is something that happens, but use where it becomes a problem or can lead to a problem, we're looking at that at the 30-day prevalence use rate, so whether or not a student has used a substance within the last month, the last 30 days.

528
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:53,031
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we measure as current use.

529
00:38:54,623 --> 00:39:00,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And historically, we've always done the survey prior to the February vacation.

530
00:39:01,365 --> 00:39:07,027
[SPEAKER_02]: And this year, I believe in last year as well, the way that the schedule worked out, the survey was done after that time.

531
00:39:07,047 --> 00:39:12,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So that might be something to think about, but I don't see that reflected in the data at this point.

532
00:39:13,248 --> 00:39:19,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Binge drinking behavior is reported if five or more drinks in one sitting in the last two weeks.

533
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:22,571
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we are measuring binge drinking behavior.

534
00:39:23,381 --> 00:39:29,165
[SPEAKER_02]: So the purpose of prevention is to delay use.

535
00:39:29,185 --> 00:39:32,327
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to drive those youth numbers back.

536
00:39:32,488 --> 00:39:40,213
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to do our best to get the people who need help, help, and to reduce the amount of people that are trying, experimenting, and using frequently.

537
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:46,998
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I have here to show you is I have multiple charts that will show you what's happened over time.

538
00:39:47,378 --> 00:39:49,380
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one here, I think, is really important.

539
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:57,351
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at the substance use as a bell curve, you're going to have 5% to 10% of the students, they're never going to use substances.

540
00:39:57,672 --> 00:40:04,462
[SPEAKER_02]: They may have family history that causes them, they may have some school commitments or some religious commitments that prevent them from using.

541
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:19,890
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the other end, you might have five to 10% of students who were gonna use no matter what prevention measures were put into place because they have family history, they have trauma, they have other leading factors that could drive them towards something of that nature.

542
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:31,136
[SPEAKER_02]: So what our goal is is really to drive the numbers back from, we want as many people getting help and more towards that five to 10% of use as opposed to never using.

543
00:40:32,357 --> 00:40:43,028
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2005, you can see here 71% of high school students, 71.2% of high school students said that they had used alcohol in their lifetime, 9th through 12th graders.

544
00:40:43,048 --> 00:40:45,030
[SPEAKER_02]: This is both the high school and the vocational school.

545
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:48,554
[SPEAKER_02]: In all of this case, those two schools are combined with the data.

546
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,963
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2017, 45.8% of the students said that they had used alcohol in their lifetime.

547
00:40:56,824 --> 00:41:00,546
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a significant change in the rates.

548
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:05,188
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is as a result of the teamwork that I talked about when I first started speaking.

549
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:09,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're doing is working, and we need to continue doing it.

550
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:13,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to continue to bring in more people into the fold and have this conversation.

551
00:41:15,268 --> 00:41:29,691
[SPEAKER_02]: This is 6th grade, and again, when we report out the data, I have both in your packet, lifetime and 30-day use, but current trends are really where you would see that there's sort of an issue that we would want to be addressing in the community.

552
00:41:30,032 --> 00:41:32,832
[SPEAKER_02]: That is where we would put more of our weight in the data.

553
00:41:33,272 --> 00:41:34,593
[SPEAKER_02]: So 6th to 8th grade,

554
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:43,735
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, over time, we've really brought these numbers down and these numbers are extremely low.

555
00:41:43,775 --> 00:41:50,617
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're looking at is, and all of you should have a chart provided with the actual percentages.

556
00:41:51,197 --> 00:41:53,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to do that because it's hard to read charts sometimes.

557
00:41:54,798 --> 00:42:00,760
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be on page six, maybe page actually five.

558
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,881
[SPEAKER_02]: So for middle school students,

559
00:42:04,936 --> 00:42:07,678
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, 30 day use is three point four percent.

560
00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:12,642
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about that's a lot lower than the national average for U.S.

561
00:42:12,722 --> 00:42:13,703
[SPEAKER_02]: norm for eighth grade.

562
00:42:13,723 --> 00:42:15,825
[SPEAKER_02]: It was seven point three percent.

563
00:42:16,225 --> 00:42:24,712
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you that our eighth graders for were reporting.

564
00:42:27,334 --> 00:42:33,499
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, there's reporting seven point nine percent, so we do want to be paying attention to that.

565
00:42:33,866 --> 00:42:35,387
[SPEAKER_02]: It's close to the national average.

566
00:42:36,127 --> 00:42:39,548
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a low number, thank goodness, but we should be talking about this.

567
00:42:39,588 --> 00:42:42,909
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why I'm saying we need to talk early and often.

568
00:42:43,229 --> 00:42:48,791
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to be prepared and we need to be ready to have those conversations.

569
00:42:48,811 --> 00:43:00,455
[SPEAKER_02]: We all should be talking to our friends' parents so they know what our personal preferences are and plans when they go to their houses, when they go to parties, they go out to football games or whatever it is, that everyone's well aware.

570
00:43:01,995 --> 00:43:03,155
[SPEAKER_02]: We do see the numbers declining.

571
00:43:03,175 --> 00:43:04,816
[SPEAKER_02]: We always want to be monitoring the numbers.

572
00:43:05,376 --> 00:43:11,878
[SPEAKER_02]: In the high school, sorry, at the 9th through 12th grade level, we see the decline as well over time.

573
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:14,579
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're very pleased to see that.

574
00:43:17,439 --> 00:43:21,181
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that we're monitoring this year that we've never monitored before is vaping.

575
00:43:21,901 --> 00:43:25,802
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have numbers to compare to the previous years.

576
00:43:26,582 --> 00:43:29,103
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we can tell you is

577
00:43:30,264 --> 00:43:31,805
[SPEAKER_02]: on page four.

578
00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:41,972
[SPEAKER_02]: What we know right now is that this is what the students reported in February of 2017.

579
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:49,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Also remember all 12th grade data, those students do not go to these school systems any longer.

580
00:43:50,037 --> 00:43:50,737
[SPEAKER_02]: They have moved on.

581
00:43:51,158 --> 00:43:53,099
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is something to be thinking about.

582
00:43:55,581 --> 00:43:59,402
[SPEAKER_02]: We believe that this number is going up exponentially as we speak.

583
00:43:59,842 --> 00:44:09,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on conversations amongst students and staff, there's a lot more concern for vaping, and we need to be thinking about it overall.

584
00:44:09,885 --> 00:44:11,106
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what vaping is.

585
00:44:11,886 --> 00:44:17,308
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the most popular vaping product that we're hearing about all over the state, really, right?

586
00:44:17,348 --> 00:44:18,028
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Juul.

587
00:44:18,768 --> 00:44:20,150
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks like a USB.

588
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:25,994
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually charge it by using it as a USB in your computer or wherever.

589
00:44:27,896 --> 00:44:30,938
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of those is equivalent to one pack of cigarettes.

590
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:34,521
[SPEAKER_02]: The most popular product is a mango flavor.

591
00:44:36,274 --> 00:44:40,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Call me crazy, but I think they're marketing to a very specific population.

592
00:44:41,355 --> 00:44:45,076
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a very catchy name and very catchy products.

593
00:44:45,356 --> 00:44:49,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And anything flavored is going to be really attractive to young people.

594
00:44:49,517 --> 00:44:51,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the thing is about this, the other day we were talking about it.

595
00:44:51,938 --> 00:44:52,698
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, oh, don't worry.

596
00:44:52,738 --> 00:44:54,499
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a patented product.

597
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:58,300
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to be making marijuana products with this.

598
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:58,900
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not true.

599
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:04,523
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually inject marijuana oil into this product once the stuff is out.

600
00:45:04,563 --> 00:45:10,786
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can go on YouTube, and you can learn anything you want to learn about how to hack this.

601
00:45:11,226 --> 00:45:13,628
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's discreet.

602
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:18,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody could be vaping in here right now, and you may not notice.

603
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,791
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be very discreet in that way.

604
00:45:21,572 --> 00:45:24,834
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something that we really need to be paying attention to.

605
00:45:24,974 --> 00:45:25,854
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very covert.

606
00:45:26,634 --> 00:45:27,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have something you want to say?

607
00:45:28,195 --> 00:45:40,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard that students are doing it in classrooms because it looks like just a USB port, and they also can even exhale right into their hoodies and you don't even see anything.

608
00:45:40,581 --> 00:45:44,142
[SPEAKER_03]: So kids in class are actually, they call it dueling.

609
00:45:47,163 --> 00:45:49,324
[SPEAKER_02]: No, finish your report and then I have mine.

610
00:45:49,484 --> 00:45:52,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so the reality is is that

611
00:45:53,486 --> 00:45:56,909
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of information and misinformation out there about vaping.

612
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:05,957
[SPEAKER_02]: But the main thing that you need to take away from this is that it contains nicotine, and nicotine is one of the most highly addicted drugs in the entire world, right?

613
00:46:06,337 --> 00:46:13,383
[SPEAKER_02]: So there may be speculation that they're going to get hooked on vaping and then they're going to get hooked on cigarettes.

614
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:18,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I argue that they're probably going to be hooked on vaping for a very long time is really what the issue is going to be.

615
00:46:19,449 --> 00:46:23,974
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't know because there isn't long-term data to show what the effect of this will be.

616
00:46:24,334 --> 00:46:29,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like with cigarettes, we didn't know what cigarettes were going to do to us, and now look at where we're at.

617
00:46:29,741 --> 00:46:32,584
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to be cautious about that.

618
00:46:32,925 --> 00:46:34,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I want to show you this because

619
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:38,441
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a product that is also a vaping product.

620
00:46:38,822 --> 00:46:42,424
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell these inserts at dispensaries.

621
00:46:42,645 --> 00:46:53,073
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you see something like this, looks like an old timey cigarette holder, that can also be filled with a THC oil of some kind or something, some sort of marijuana derivative product.

622
00:46:54,388 --> 00:47:03,252
[SPEAKER_02]: So marijuana has become legalized in Massachusetts, and it's still dangerous for kids to use marijuana.

623
00:47:03,692 --> 00:47:10,815
[SPEAKER_02]: It can create long-term changes in the way that their brain responds to addictions.

624
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:13,076
[SPEAKER_02]: It can do a number of different things.

625
00:47:13,757 --> 00:47:19,279
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want to show you in this slide is a very, very busy slide, but I put everything in one slide so that I didn't forget about a single thing.

626
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Perception of harm.

627
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,180
[SPEAKER_02]: So great risk of harm.

628
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,981
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how our students said on the survey that if you tried marijuana, you would be at great risk of harm.

629
00:47:29,241 --> 00:47:31,202
[SPEAKER_02]: There were other things, moderate risk, no risk.

630
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:34,442
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is specifically looking at the term great risk of harm.

631
00:47:34,882 --> 00:47:40,203
[SPEAKER_02]: So the good news is that there are a number of people who do think that you'd be at great risk of harm if you tried marijuana just once.

632
00:47:41,643 --> 00:47:48,825
[SPEAKER_02]: But then in some cases, oddly, that smoking it regularly is somehow OK.

633
00:47:51,794 --> 00:47:57,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Great risk harm is a measure that if you look at, this is what the data shows nationally, right?

634
00:47:57,977 --> 00:48:01,039
[SPEAKER_02]: That if you believe it's harmful, you will use it less.

635
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:09,063
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we want to do is make sure that people are well informed of what these drugs and alcohol and everything can do to you.

636
00:48:10,913 --> 00:48:12,435
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like these numbers are pretty low.

637
00:48:12,995 --> 00:48:17,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that this is going to be an ongoing problem for a long time and I'm going to tell you why.

638
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:22,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's very difficult to convey honest facts to young people about marijuana.

639
00:48:23,765 --> 00:48:30,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And we as a community really need to hunker down and think about how to present this information.

640
00:48:30,672 --> 00:48:32,213
[SPEAKER_02]: If we provide false facts

641
00:48:32,934 --> 00:48:36,775
[SPEAKER_02]: of scare tactics to young people, it will not change that number.

642
00:48:37,155 --> 00:48:42,657
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll probably make other things worse because then they'll know for a fact that you were lying to them about marijuana.

643
00:48:42,717 --> 00:48:44,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're lying about cocaine.

644
00:48:44,278 --> 00:48:46,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're lying about heroin or other opioids.

645
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:47,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

646
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:52,861
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we want to do is figure out what is our game plan and to really work on that.

647
00:48:52,881 --> 00:48:59,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there is some education in the curriculum, but I think that we can be doing more and we need to be thinking about this.

648
00:49:00,847 --> 00:49:01,507
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit more.

649
00:49:01,627 --> 00:49:08,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we as a state should have been thinking about this a little bit more all along the way and be prepared because this was going to happen.

650
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:23,417
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other thing to be very aware of, which is startling to me even, even though I've seen it all, no I haven't really seen it all, but is that driving with someone under the influence of marijuana is pretty high in high school students.

651
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:34,086
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know one thing for sure, that Mothers Against Drunk Driving did a hell of a job of changing drinking and driving rates amongst young people.

652
00:49:34,526 --> 00:49:37,568
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also need to be thinking about this with marijuana as well.

653
00:49:38,048 --> 00:49:44,532
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks to me like almost 30% of high school seniors last year had driven in a car with someone under the influence of marijuana.

654
00:49:44,552 --> 00:49:50,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that classically, people who smoke marijuana will go for a joy ride.

655
00:49:50,156 --> 00:49:50,876
[SPEAKER_02]: They hop in their car.

656
00:49:50,896 --> 00:49:52,217
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of a part of the culture.

657
00:49:52,807 --> 00:50:01,234
[SPEAKER_02]: is, you know, getting in your car and getting isolated, getting away from, you know, wherever, especially when you're a teenager because you don't have the freedom to smoke weed in your house or marijuana in your house.

658
00:50:01,294 --> 00:50:03,936
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to be paying attention to that.

659
00:50:04,157 --> 00:50:06,358
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to be paying very close attention to that, I think.

660
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,661
[SPEAKER_02]: All in all, if you were to

661
00:50:12,053 --> 00:50:18,575
[SPEAKER_02]: take a look at these marijuana rates, we are low in use rates.

662
00:50:18,655 --> 00:50:21,215
[SPEAKER_02]: We're lower than most of the country.

663
00:50:21,315 --> 00:50:27,437
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that, you know, it's really interesting.

664
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:29,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just go back real quick.

665
00:50:30,058 --> 00:50:30,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially with high school.

666
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:41,430
[SPEAKER_02]: So marijuana is the gray line, the third line down here, starting on the left, and then it goes up.

667
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:44,953
[SPEAKER_02]: 2009, 2013, which makes perfect sense, because it's decriminalization.

668
00:50:45,393 --> 00:50:47,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical marijuana becomes legal, right?

669
00:50:47,735 --> 00:50:50,977
[SPEAKER_02]: So the perception of harm has definitely changed at that point.

670
00:50:51,357 --> 00:50:54,979
[SPEAKER_02]: But for some reason, from 2013 into 2017, we're still seeing a decline.

671
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:59,622
[SPEAKER_02]: in that use, in that regular use of marijuana.

672
00:51:00,062 --> 00:51:09,484
[SPEAKER_02]: But what typically happens with marijuana use rates is there may be less people who start using marijuana, but the people who use marijuana use it far more chronically.

673
00:51:10,225 --> 00:51:11,505
[SPEAKER_02]: So they may use it more.

674
00:51:11,645 --> 00:51:13,726
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something to also be thinking about.

675
00:51:18,439 --> 00:51:25,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, we get to the get to the get to the end of the presentation here, where we're doing a lot of things as a community.

676
00:51:26,107 --> 00:51:28,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned the youth diversion program.

677
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:36,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned all the work that we've done over the years, working with the school and the police, working on research, finding evidence based practices.

678
00:51:37,439 --> 00:51:38,740
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the city has done.

679
00:51:39,761 --> 00:51:46,268
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also have a grant called Partnerships for Success that's specifically focusing on prescription drug prevention.

680
00:51:47,189 --> 00:51:48,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Our numbers are very low.

681
00:51:49,031 --> 00:51:59,222
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go back to your charts and you look at 30-day use rates, and even, well, I would say look at your lifetime rates of prescription drugs.

682
00:52:01,426 --> 00:52:14,571
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see that in 2005, the high school students, we had 11.4% of students reporting that they use prescription drugs without a doctor's prescription.

683
00:52:15,431 --> 00:52:16,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're looking at now

684
00:52:17,352 --> 00:52:20,753
[SPEAKER_02]: of all students ever having tried 3.8 percent.

685
00:52:21,173 --> 00:52:29,697
[SPEAKER_02]: So regardless of the situation that's happening in our community with overdoses, we're seeing youth rates decline with opioid use.

686
00:52:31,037 --> 00:52:39,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I still see, you know, numbers declining with tranquilizers and then also stimulants are sort of leveled off from the previous year.

687
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:46,363
[SPEAKER_02]: But our urge with our grant is to really say we need to be paying attention to all of these prescription drugs.

688
00:52:46,823 --> 00:52:51,766
[SPEAKER_02]: They all cause, you know, can create an effect and cause a problem.

689
00:52:52,547 --> 00:52:54,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Opioids are clearly our biggest concern.

690
00:52:54,608 --> 00:52:55,729
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all over the news.

691
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:59,532
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a good thing because people are talking about it to their kids.

692
00:52:59,632 --> 00:53:02,914
[SPEAKER_02]: They're talking about what's going on with other family members maybe.

693
00:53:04,235 --> 00:53:05,116
[SPEAKER_02]: My aunt lives in Indiana.

694
00:53:05,136 --> 00:53:09,319
[SPEAKER_02]: She had crazy surgery, and they were all over her prescription pain meds.

695
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:13,642
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was very pleased to hear that, not just in Massachusetts, but other parts of the country.

696
00:53:14,042 --> 00:53:16,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Doctors are paying attention to those pain medications.

697
00:53:17,385 --> 00:53:23,970
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing is I went to Tufts last week, and I did a training on how to use naloxone with Armstrong Ambulance.

698
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:27,593
[SPEAKER_02]: And I stated that cocaine is being cut with fentanyl.

699
00:53:28,193 --> 00:53:30,575
[SPEAKER_02]: on the street and I had a kid look up at me like, oh.

700
00:53:31,255 --> 00:53:41,102
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have, and I'm not saying that kid uses cocaine, my point though being that people are unaware of this and it's very important to know that we have to pay attention to all drug use.

701
00:53:41,262 --> 00:53:44,665
[SPEAKER_02]: It should not be about this drug is bad, this one isn't as bad.

702
00:53:45,185 --> 00:53:53,131
[SPEAKER_02]: All drugs are bad because, and alcohol too, because it creates addiction and pathways to addiction then lead to further addiction problems.

703
00:53:54,938 --> 00:53:56,279
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that we just want to be aware of.

704
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:02,226
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyhow, the Partnerships for Success grant, we have multiple projects that we're working with the school on.

705
00:54:02,726 --> 00:54:16,741
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing is a health and safety guide went out to all families from, I believe, eighth grade to 11th grade at the end of last year, and it was a 24-page guide, multiple

706
00:54:17,201 --> 00:54:24,763
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple things to think about, where to dispose of drugs, what is vaping, understanding stress in your students, prescription drugs.

707
00:54:24,883 --> 00:54:30,585
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very well-organized litany of resources as well as information.

708
00:54:31,165 --> 00:54:34,866
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one way that we're trying to get information out to parents is direct mailing.

709
00:54:35,786 --> 00:54:41,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that we're doing that I think is really important is that we've helped through working with Rachel.

710
00:54:41,628 --> 00:54:46,229
[SPEAKER_02]: We've implemented a module on prescription drugs into the 10th grade curriculum.

711
00:54:47,473 --> 00:54:48,374
[SPEAKER_02]: for the Michigan model.

712
00:54:49,215 --> 00:54:55,321
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have a risk to resiliency professional development series where we're talking about trauma-informed care.

713
00:54:55,701 --> 00:54:57,924
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about absenteeism.

714
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:03,810
[SPEAKER_02]: And really what we're trying to communicate is that we want to build these kids up.

715
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:04,490
[SPEAKER_02]: right?

716
00:55:05,131 --> 00:55:08,515
[SPEAKER_02]: If we just say that you're going to do drugs, you're going to do drugs, they might do drugs.

717
00:55:08,915 --> 00:55:10,197
[SPEAKER_02]: You've told them that's who they are.

718
00:55:10,637 --> 00:55:24,993
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to really do the opposite of that and try to identify those sparks, those things that make individuals who they are and things that they can find sense of purpose, not our sense of purpose on these kids, but what is their sense of purpose so that they can have that

719
00:55:25,373 --> 00:55:31,520
[SPEAKER_02]: driven internal, you know, guiding thing that keeps them in that 5 to 10% away from substances.

720
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,083
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're working with faculty to get them that information.

721
00:55:35,364 --> 00:55:44,313
[SPEAKER_02]: So through the lens of asset building, the lens of looking at kids as though they have positive things to bring to this world, but understanding those risk factors.

722
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:45,635
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, we're working with

723
00:55:46,355 --> 00:55:54,561
[SPEAKER_02]: two identified faculty members, one's a coach and one's an after school club advisor.

724
00:55:54,941 --> 00:56:02,387
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're working with them to do training to all of the school clubs and advisors, because in the city of Medford, that's where kids go after school in the high school.

725
00:56:02,427 --> 00:56:04,088
[SPEAKER_02]: They go to the clubs, they go to sports.

726
00:56:04,408 --> 00:56:08,811
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're doing a integrated training with them around developmental relationships.

727
00:56:09,152 --> 00:56:12,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Just what I was saying, how do you identify those sparks in that kid?

728
00:56:12,434 --> 00:56:38,801
[SPEAKER_02]: you have you have these high high achievers who are overstressed out and you have people who don't participate because the high achievers might be taken over so we're trying to talk about how do you balance that how you facilitate your clubs how do you operate as a club advisor as opposed to a teacher in a classroom so um those are our main programs that we're doing at the city and then i'm going to step back and let um rachel and tony talk about the projects that they've done in the school and then i'll answer questions i'll just thank you penny thank you

729
00:56:40,569 --> 00:56:40,989
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening.

730
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:43,851
[SPEAKER_20]: I wanted to talk a little bit about vaping.

731
00:56:44,392 --> 00:56:51,117
[SPEAKER_20]: Penny had talked about our numbers going down, but we have noticed we're seeing more and more of it here at the high school, so we have addressed it.

732
00:56:52,318 --> 00:57:04,127
[SPEAKER_20]: One thing we have done is on November 21st, there was a meeting, a staff meeting that Nick Tucci actually presented information on vaping to our teachers, to our staff, presented what to look for, what the dangers are.

733
00:57:04,827 --> 00:57:09,290
[SPEAKER_20]: and what they can do if they see a student actually vaping in class, what the steps are from there.

734
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:14,893
[SPEAKER_20]: Tony has actually done some information out on our blog, out to parents.

735
00:57:15,353 --> 00:57:17,154
[SPEAKER_20]: So that was out, I believe, was that October?

736
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,234
[SPEAKER_20]: That was in October.

737
00:57:19,775 --> 00:57:24,718
[SPEAKER_20]: What we're working on right now is another message that goes out to all parents that will be going out in December.

738
00:57:26,779 --> 00:57:32,222
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Dempsey and Lisa Dunphy are also working on a video that students will be making

739
00:57:32,665 --> 00:57:36,147
[SPEAKER_20]: and that will actually be presented as a homeroom activity in January.

740
00:57:36,207 --> 00:57:38,208
[SPEAKER_20]: So that will go out to all the students at the high school.

741
00:57:39,709 --> 00:57:49,655
[SPEAKER_20]: We have set up a presentation for February 8th for all parents where it will be a vaping presentation along with in plain sight, which will be here again at the high school.

742
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:55,259
[SPEAKER_20]: We had that at City Hall last year, but we thought it would be something that in light of everything that we could bring back.

743
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:02,263
[SPEAKER_20]: And as part of our Michigan model curriculum, we've added vaping to any

744
00:58:03,131 --> 00:58:08,556
[SPEAKER_20]: lesson that included tobacco, so this is in the second year at the high school and the first year at the middle schools.

745
00:58:09,217 --> 00:58:17,544
[SPEAKER_20]: I did reach out to the principals at the middle schools and they really haven't seen much going on with vaping there, but we have seen the uptick here at the high school.

746
00:58:17,724 --> 00:58:20,667
[SPEAKER_15]: They know what to look for in the middle schools, the teachers and?

747
00:58:20,907 --> 00:58:24,931
[SPEAKER_20]: That's something that we can actually present, that would be the next step to bring it down to the middle school.

748
00:58:26,012 --> 00:58:26,292
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

749
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

750
00:58:28,601 --> 00:58:37,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I think some of the health services department activities we've talked about in the past, first being the expert screening that we do in grade nine.

751
00:58:37,788 --> 00:58:39,810
[SPEAKER_06]: This year, we're extending that to grade seven.

752
00:58:40,831 --> 00:58:49,798
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in the process of finishing all the training for the middle school staff so that we can start that after the turn of the year.

753
00:58:50,198 --> 00:58:52,620
[SPEAKER_06]: And our high school screening will start in January.

754
00:58:53,594 --> 00:58:59,840
[SPEAKER_06]: The other project the School Health Advisory Council has been involved in is we're reaching out to the community physicians.

755
00:59:00,721 --> 00:59:10,449
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've met with the chief of pediatrics at Winchester Hospital, and we're looking to get onto the agenda for one of their Grand Rounds meetings.

756
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:19,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to be discussing ways that we as school support staff can work and collaborate with the community physicians so we have better communication,

757
00:59:20,455 --> 00:59:27,240
[SPEAKER_06]: And we each understand each other's models and we can be working on the same agendas.

758
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:31,283
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're very pleased to be reaching out into the community for that.

759
00:59:34,605 --> 00:59:37,087
[SPEAKER_06]: I think everything else has been mentioned.

760
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:44,612
[SPEAKER_06]: But our real goal is to get out education to parents and to faculty this year about all these changes.

761
00:59:45,798 --> 00:59:46,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

762
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:46,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

763
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:47,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuno.

764
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:47,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

765
00:59:47,819 --> 00:59:52,021
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I just want to say thank you to all of you and everyone who's involved in this.

766
00:59:52,061 --> 00:59:56,783
[SPEAKER_08]: The educational piece in this is extremely important, and the work that you've done has been extremely important.

767
00:59:57,183 --> 00:59:58,384
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to say thank you for that.

768
00:59:58,664 --> 01:00:00,145
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do have some questions.

769
01:00:00,345 --> 01:00:09,889
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as the survey, Penny, when the survey goes out, are there questions on the survey asking, like, when do they do this?

770
01:00:09,949 --> 01:00:10,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it weekends?

771
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:13,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it, you know, after school, before school, during school?

772
01:00:14,551 --> 01:00:15,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are they doing it?

773
01:00:15,732 --> 01:00:19,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they doing it just as an experimental, one-time thing?

774
01:00:19,334 --> 01:00:20,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they doing it because they're bored?

775
01:00:20,815 --> 01:00:22,616
[SPEAKER_08]: They're doing it because there's peer pressure?

776
01:00:24,237 --> 01:00:26,438
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, different questions like that.

777
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:27,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything like that in the survey?

778
01:00:28,179 --> 01:00:34,523
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's no questions like that, but there are questions about where they get their alcohol, or I believe it's just alcohol.

779
01:00:35,003 --> 01:00:41,986
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do think it is important, not that I'm saying that, no matter when anyone uses anything like this, it's always important.

780
01:00:42,366 --> 01:00:51,931
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think if we could at least get a base on, well, gee, it's happening more on the weekends, it's happening after school, it's happening for our students that are busy.

781
01:00:52,491 --> 01:00:55,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they doing it more when it's not their season?

782
01:00:55,553 --> 01:01:00,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they doing it when it's not their hockey season, or their soccer season, or their football season?

783
01:01:00,695 --> 01:01:02,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is it for our drama students?

784
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:04,341
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not picking on clubs.

785
01:01:04,421 --> 01:01:06,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying as examples.

786
01:01:06,785 --> 01:01:14,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it students that are always involved with a particular project that they're in, or a team that they're on, or a debate after school?

787
01:01:15,979 --> 01:01:20,883
[SPEAKER_08]: that kind of makes them think twice because they definitely know the repercussions of that.

788
01:01:21,243 --> 01:01:32,311
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think for us all, I think it would be very important to know because if we could stop pinpointing where these stats go, okay, it's lower at this time, it's higher at this time.

789
01:01:32,431 --> 01:01:35,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it around final exams?

790
01:01:35,593 --> 01:01:37,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it around MCAS?

791
01:01:37,214 --> 01:01:38,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it around the parks?

792
01:01:38,815 --> 01:01:41,878
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so many variables and I think that

793
01:01:42,857 --> 01:01:45,759
[SPEAKER_08]: We, you have done this survey now for the last few years.

794
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:51,304
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, as a school committee member and as a parent, I think I would like to see it a little bit more expand.

795
01:01:51,364 --> 01:01:59,191
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's a lot more work, but to expand it to really see the pinpoint of where these students, you know, and why they're doing it.

796
01:02:00,292 --> 01:02:04,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes there's no answers to those questions, and I totally understand that.

797
01:02:04,655 --> 01:02:20,648
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing I was going to ask you, too, is you had mentioned about, and I apologize if I used the wrong terminology, but the interventions, if you find that there's a group of students that are having a party, and then you bring them in for a three-hour workshop.

798
01:02:22,829 --> 01:02:24,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Have we found those numbers to go up?

799
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:27,171
[SPEAKER_08]: No, those numbers are very low, actually.

800
01:02:28,011 --> 01:02:36,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Our police officer, we've been doing this project since 2012, and it's been rolled out for about three years now.

801
01:02:39,011 --> 01:02:39,952
[SPEAKER_02]: The numbers are very low.

802
01:02:41,552 --> 01:02:43,734
[SPEAKER_02]: We just are not seeing very many kids in the park.

803
01:02:43,894 --> 01:02:44,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Not by we.

804
01:02:44,974 --> 01:02:49,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a patrol officer, but the patrol officer not seeing people out in the park very often.

805
01:02:49,457 --> 01:02:54,039
[SPEAKER_02]: We've sent out youth car specifically for that on high, you know, incident times.

806
01:02:54,179 --> 01:03:00,322
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're just not having as many of those calls coming in as they did years in the in the years past.

807
01:03:02,038 --> 01:03:05,364
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that it's very interesting.

808
01:03:05,424 --> 01:03:07,908
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I would say to you is this about those questions.

809
01:03:07,928 --> 01:03:09,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to answer that.

810
01:03:09,731 --> 01:03:12,595
[SPEAKER_02]: This survey is a national survey.

811
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:19,372
[SPEAKER_02]: The questions that are on there are vetted through research.

812
01:03:19,792 --> 01:03:31,536
[SPEAKER_02]: So to add more questions on, this is already 200 questions for the students to sit and get through, which is much, is far more extensive than the YRBS that others ask.

813
01:03:31,576 --> 01:03:33,157
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're already asking a lot from these kids.

814
01:03:33,497 --> 01:03:38,019
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other thing is, is that we can get some of that information just through a different method.

815
01:03:38,059 --> 01:03:41,180
[SPEAKER_02]: We could use focus groups, key informant interviews,

816
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:47,765
[SPEAKER_02]: We would just need to find a way to get like a third party to come in, you know, and to do that and to set those up.

817
01:03:47,825 --> 01:03:50,527
[SPEAKER_02]: So for instance, I'm calling out to all the parents.

818
01:03:50,587 --> 01:04:06,139
[SPEAKER_02]: If parents know that, you know, they want to know this information and they're willing to sign a permission slip, we have already have the means to start asking questions like this and getting qualitative data for us to find more out about when and where and how this is happening in the city.

819
01:04:06,491 --> 01:04:07,952
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think it's really important.

820
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:17,341
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I understand the national one because you do want to compare us to everyone else, but the bottom line is also we want to make sure of what's happening in our own backyard.

821
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:24,987
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that, you know, again, it's not forcing anyone to, you know, to answer these questions, but I think it's really important to know when

822
01:04:25,788 --> 01:04:26,928
[SPEAKER_08]: and certain things are happening.

823
01:04:27,649 --> 01:04:34,270
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as to go back to kids hanging around the park, kids haven't been hanging around the park in a very long time.

824
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:36,111
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't really happen as much anymore.

825
01:04:36,471 --> 01:04:39,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Years ago, parents allowed kids to hang around the park.

826
01:04:39,572 --> 01:04:40,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Nowadays, they don't.

827
01:04:41,172 --> 01:04:44,573
[SPEAKER_08]: But that doesn't mean that just because they're not, things aren't happening.

828
01:04:45,254 --> 01:04:49,615
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't want to put blinders on and say that everybody's perfect and nothing's happening.

829
01:04:50,055 --> 01:05:09,011
[SPEAKER_08]: But unfortunately, we have seen, and I'm not saying it in the city of Medford, and I'm not saying it doesn't happen in the city of Medford, but unfortunately, we have seen situations from, you know, it hits the media or whatever that, well, you know, gee, parents think, well, my kids are gonna go out and drink anyway, so why don't we all have them downstairs in the basement?

830
01:05:09,571 --> 01:05:13,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Or gee, you know, they're gonna be doing that anyway, so why don't we have them, you know, here?

831
01:05:14,215 --> 01:05:16,837
[SPEAKER_08]: So just because they're not in a so-called park,

832
01:05:18,759 --> 01:05:21,141
[SPEAKER_08]: I still think that we have to have our ears and eyes open.

833
01:05:21,301 --> 01:05:38,717
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I was saying, if our administration, if teachers hear anything about this big party going on or anything like that, hey, if the police officers happen to be around that area at that time, and it's not a get you, I have to get you type of thing.

834
01:05:39,057 --> 01:05:43,642
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really to be more preventative before anything happens.

835
01:05:43,662 --> 01:05:44,142
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all it is.

836
01:05:46,044 --> 01:06:03,157
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as the vaporing and the marijuana, I mean, my opinion is it's because now the legalization of it all, and I think that, you know, students and anyone who had the mentality before saying, oh, gee, it was marijuana that didn't want to touch it.

837
01:06:03,197 --> 01:06:06,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, like, oh, it's marijuana because, like, we can't have it.

838
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:07,661
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've seen it.

839
01:06:07,821 --> 01:06:09,302
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen it this summer especially.

840
01:06:09,722 --> 01:06:19,211
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen it, like, you know, people just, you know, smoking it, going down the street, and you have young children with you, and now young children are, like, smelling it, and you're smelling it.

841
01:06:19,691 --> 01:06:24,035
[SPEAKER_08]: And here we were years ago saying, you know, well, gee, do you know what, you know, secondhand smoking does?

842
01:06:24,055 --> 01:06:29,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we have to explain to our kids, you know, well, gee, secondhand marijuana, inhaling it.

843
01:06:30,517 --> 01:06:34,179
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and it's a very, very concerning situation.

844
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:40,901
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that as a school system, we've been lucky enough to say, yes, we can ban it because we ban cigarettes.

845
01:06:40,941 --> 01:06:42,522
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not allowed to do that.

846
01:06:43,002 --> 01:06:47,604
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know if that number now is rising because students, you know, it's a new thing.

847
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:57,848
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if it's the mentality of it all, and we could do it, it's not a big deal, it's not as bad as the cigarettes, because we don't have anything healthier yet to prove that.

848
01:06:58,689 --> 01:07:01,010
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if those numbers are going up because of it.

849
01:07:03,391 --> 01:07:15,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I have a very extensive conversation with one of the classes here a couple months ago about vaping, about marijuana, and you know,

850
01:07:17,263 --> 01:07:19,726
[SPEAKER_02]: They were really practical.

851
01:07:20,648 --> 01:07:21,789
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to know where the research is?

852
01:07:23,014 --> 01:07:24,754
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to see the data.

853
01:07:24,894 --> 01:07:31,676
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a good thing in many ways, because these are well-educated young people who are researching information on their own.

854
01:07:32,036 --> 01:07:35,877
[SPEAKER_02]: On the same hand, they want to see it.

855
01:07:35,997 --> 01:07:37,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, it's not there.

856
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:37,837
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not provided.

857
01:07:38,598 --> 01:07:41,178
[SPEAKER_02]: But I pushed them.

858
01:07:41,218 --> 01:07:45,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I pushed them far and hard to think about this in a broader context.

859
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:47,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a really rich discussion.

860
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:52,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that there's tons of opportunity for us to have youth-led

861
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:57,379
[SPEAKER_02]: initiatives that talk about vaping, that talk about marijuana use, I think that we can

862
01:07:57,817 --> 01:07:59,879
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely be looking at that in the future.

863
01:07:59,899 --> 01:08:05,863
[SPEAKER_02]: These are really brilliant kids in the school, so I'd be very interested to start doing that.

864
01:08:05,883 --> 01:08:07,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Just two more questions real quick.

865
01:08:07,985 --> 01:08:10,067
[SPEAKER_08]: One is to both Tony and Rachel.

866
01:08:10,407 --> 01:08:20,255
[SPEAKER_08]: You were saying that you're speaking to our teachers more and more now about the way to be more aware of it, to be more cautious of it, and they know what the next steps are, but what do the students know?

867
01:08:20,295 --> 01:08:21,716
[SPEAKER_08]: What are their next steps?

868
01:08:21,776 --> 01:08:25,339
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're caught with it, what happens?

869
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:26,600
[SPEAKER_06]: The administration would follow

870
01:08:27,139 --> 01:08:29,441
[SPEAKER_06]: the discipline codes that are in the handbook.

871
01:08:29,461 --> 01:08:33,164
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's similar to using, God bless you, tobacco products.

872
01:08:33,464 --> 01:08:37,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So they would follow those discipline codes.

873
01:08:38,569 --> 01:08:54,723
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess, Penny, the other thing is for you is I know that you've done a lot of outreach, but is there still any one-to-one on with the schools, like when they have parent-teacher nights, or if they're doing a special thing in their schools, is there anything going on that you have a table set up?

874
01:08:55,163 --> 01:09:10,080
[SPEAKER_08]: So because I know it's difficult sometimes to get parents out because everyone is busy, but sometimes if they're there and I don't want to overtake another meeting, but I'm just saying that if you know that you're going to get a good crowd out there because of that meeting, is there something set up that night?

875
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:19,453
[SPEAKER_08]: with your information, with someone out there to talk, or maybe even have a five-minute, you know, discussion with the audience.

876
01:09:19,473 --> 01:09:26,443
[SPEAKER_02]: So over the years, there's been, you know, a myriad of ways that I've been included in these types of events.

877
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:33,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had opportunities to speak before the parent teacher night presentation begins and that table there.

878
01:09:34,824 --> 01:09:46,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had, you know, the best part about the city of Medford and the work that we've done here is that this community really takes on the work themselves.

879
01:09:46,575 --> 01:09:51,119
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when high quality information is being put out, I don't need to be there.

880
01:09:51,819 --> 01:09:53,680
[SPEAKER_02]: just to be a steward over it.

881
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:54,461
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being done.

882
01:09:54,861 --> 01:10:05,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the stuff that happens for when DA Ryan comes and talks about social host liability, that's a tremendous program, and that's happening on a regular yearly basis.

883
01:10:05,647 --> 01:10:09,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the kinds of things that we really, really shows how

884
01:10:10,201 --> 01:10:12,322
[SPEAKER_02]: much effort is being put in by the school system.

885
01:10:14,023 --> 01:10:27,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year we had Dr. Ruth Cody come and do a presentation as a partnership and there were 75 people there but the majority were faculty and other people that work in school systems throughout the region.

886
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:30,732
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, the first time we ever had a presentation here it was

887
01:10:31,752 --> 01:10:35,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Be a parent, not a pal, social host liability, just like the DAs.

888
01:10:36,216 --> 01:10:38,879
[SPEAKER_02]: There were three people that showed up.

889
01:10:39,259 --> 01:10:43,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was 2,400 mail outs that went out advertising this program.

890
01:10:43,663 --> 01:10:52,971
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just like, it's nice to see when people do come and we get to talk to them and they see that we're not, but really what happens is when we do a community table,

891
01:10:54,873 --> 01:11:05,641
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very scary to people to talk about substance abuse when you're talking about a 7th grade kid or even a 7 year old or even a high school kid who you've never seen have an issue with it.

892
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:07,963
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not want to talk to it.

893
01:11:08,003 --> 01:11:09,164
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're called Team Medford.

894
01:11:09,744 --> 01:11:12,506
[SPEAKER_02]: people because people just don't want to talk about it.

895
01:11:12,826 --> 01:11:21,570
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very rare that you get a good, you know, showing out at your table at the community tabling events, but it is worth it.

896
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:24,912
[SPEAKER_02]: We do often have a really good conversation with at least one person.

897
01:11:25,332 --> 01:11:29,754
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, I mean, we go to as many as we can, and we'll continue to do that.

898
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:35,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see where it's actually an institutionalized conversation.

899
01:11:35,216 --> 01:11:39,602
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just like, oh, the substance abuse people are coming and walking in and they're going to tell you some information.

900
01:11:39,943 --> 01:11:45,731
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice when we're coming and we're asked to be experts, but it's really a part of the growth of an individual.

901
01:11:46,132 --> 01:11:49,655
[SPEAKER_02]: to be talking about this, so I think that it should be sort of embedded in everything.

902
01:11:49,695 --> 01:12:06,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's why I was saying, I know having you come in just by yourselves, even though you have a great program, it's just, as you mentioned, scary sometimes, and people don't want to hear it sometimes, and so this way here, instead of having it directly, that's why I was saying if there was some collaboration,

903
01:12:06,769 --> 01:12:07,769
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that you've had it.

904
01:12:08,069 --> 01:12:10,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I know that they've had it.

905
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:26,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I just for people that are watching that don't know about it, you know, and maybe they don't feel comfortable calling you, but they might feel comfortable calling a principal or a teacher or, you know, or a child listening, you know, happens to listen to this and and asks another, you know, another student.

906
01:12:26,735 --> 01:12:27,995
[SPEAKER_08]: At least they know that, gee,

907
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,937
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have to necessarily call you directly.

908
01:12:30,957 --> 01:12:34,060
[SPEAKER_08]: They can go to someone because they know that you're all working together.

909
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:34,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

910
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:35,661
[SPEAKER_02]: That's absolutely true.

911
01:12:36,021 --> 01:12:41,826
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the biggest things for their buck in the college setting is how to help a friend.

912
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:47,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And we worked with a student last year to put up posters that were about how to help a friend.

913
01:12:47,771 --> 01:12:49,252
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're advertised to the kids.

914
01:12:50,593 --> 01:12:56,496
[SPEAKER_02]: about how do you get resources for your friends, and they're up, but again, do they see them?

915
01:12:56,556 --> 01:13:04,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless we paid a million dollars to have a Snapchat story commercial, I don't know if anyone's ever gonna see it, let's be honest.

916
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,102
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're putting them up.

917
01:13:07,762 --> 01:13:08,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Benedetto.

918
01:13:08,562 --> 01:13:10,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Through you to the superintendent.

919
01:13:11,544 --> 01:13:14,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a vaping policy on the books, or are we using the tobacco policy?

920
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:20,852
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're using the tobacco policy because vaping is sort of a derivative.

921
01:13:21,732 --> 01:13:25,874
[SPEAKER_18]: But as we move forward, we'll obviously specify a little bit more completely.

922
01:13:26,055 --> 01:13:32,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with the growth I see throughout, not just our community, but socially, in adults as well as

923
01:13:33,738 --> 01:13:58,217
[SPEAKER_03]: high school age students, I would like for this committee to start working on that, so that way it's in our handbooks as vaping, as juuling, as the correct terminology, so students are very clear how we as adults feel in this community about this, because students just do not believe, they think that, oh, I quit smoking, I'm only vaping now, and that's what you hear.

924
01:13:58,757 --> 01:14:16,983
[SPEAKER_03]: and they don't realize when it gets in their lungs it's like popcorn and it blows up their lungs and it does all these health implications and there's not a lot of data because they haven't been doing it for years, but having two people in my house who read this report before I got here, 27 and, almost 27 and almost 25.

925
01:14:17,924 --> 01:14:24,306
[SPEAKER_03]: One's a future NP and one works in another community on these exact programs.

926
01:14:24,786 --> 01:14:26,747
[SPEAKER_03]: They were happy to see our numbers.

927
01:14:27,507 --> 01:14:29,510
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're doing a great job in MedFed.

928
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:39,002
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to be clear, call it what it is, name it, say it's not okay, and tell them that from day one, so that way the wording is correct.

929
01:14:39,022 --> 01:14:42,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Because once you name something, it's not like this secret thing anymore.

930
01:14:42,386 --> 01:14:43,628
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as cool, not as fun.

931
01:14:44,789 --> 01:14:48,952
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a motion on the floor and I need a second from one of my colleagues.

932
01:14:49,933 --> 01:15:04,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see this in place and in every handbook at our junior high and high school level by next year so that parents know that this is happening in our community and that we're taking it seriously and we're not gonna continue.

933
01:15:05,387 --> 01:15:05,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

934
01:15:05,707 --> 01:15:06,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

935
01:15:06,508 --> 01:15:06,668
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

936
01:15:06,688 --> 01:15:07,668
[SPEAKER_19]: Vander Kloof.

937
01:15:07,968 --> 01:15:20,175
[SPEAKER_19]: Penny, last spring I was able to attend, and I don't remember the title of it, but the Night of Remembrance for those who had died of opiate deaths, related deaths.

938
01:15:20,775 --> 01:15:26,058
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of the things, and it was a very powerful presentation, but there were two speakers that particularly impacted me.

939
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:29,840
[SPEAKER_19]: They were both students who had previously attended Medford High.

940
01:15:31,081 --> 01:15:36,285
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of the things that they said was they both said they actually were pretty good kids here.

941
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:39,868
[SPEAKER_19]: They were, you know, were popular.

942
01:15:39,948 --> 01:15:47,215
[SPEAKER_19]: They were, you know, kids who were not involved, particularly with drugs or alcohol at that time.

943
01:15:48,755 --> 01:16:00,239
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of my biggest concerns is, I think we're doing good work laying a positive foundation here, but I'm totally worried about that transition off to college.

944
01:16:00,599 --> 01:16:04,281
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm not sure, you just mentioned some posters, how to help a friend.

945
01:16:04,301 --> 01:16:08,602
[SPEAKER_19]: And we see these incredible stories of the Fratt brothers.

946
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:13,524
[SPEAKER_19]: who are drinking too much and then let their frat brother die.

947
01:16:13,644 --> 01:16:19,186
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's where I'm wondering, our last, we're touching the kids at 10th grade.

948
01:16:20,047 --> 01:16:26,229
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know whether we're discussing at that point, hey, when you get to college, these are things to expect.

949
01:16:27,330 --> 01:16:31,551
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just concerned about that transition to college and loneliness too.

950
01:16:32,132 --> 01:16:37,314
[SPEAKER_19]: For some kids, when they go off, we put so much, hey, we're going to college and then all of a sudden they get there and it's kind of a little lonely sometimes.

951
01:16:38,157 --> 01:16:40,018
[SPEAKER_20]: So we do touch upon that in 10th grade.

952
01:16:40,198 --> 01:16:46,462
[SPEAKER_20]: Last year, we actually had Armstrong Ambulance come in, and they did a training for all of our seniors going off to college.

953
01:16:46,842 --> 01:16:50,344
[SPEAKER_20]: They talked about drugs, drug use, overdoses.

954
01:16:50,864 --> 01:16:53,185
[SPEAKER_20]: They learned how to do CPR, first aid.

955
01:16:54,606 --> 01:17:00,269
[SPEAKER_20]: So that was actually something that we started last year to help those students transitioning from senior year into college.

956
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:07,177
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, I just wondered, those two speakers who were there that night, have they come and spoken?

957
01:17:07,277 --> 01:17:18,603
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that they both expressed willingness to me and others to come and talk directly to students, and I've wondered if you might.

958
01:17:18,663 --> 01:17:24,866
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure you have the names, and they certainly expressed their willingness to me, and I think that we might, it might be valuable.

959
01:17:26,679 --> 01:17:33,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for not including the naloxone training to seniors and also to our vocational students.

960
01:17:35,327 --> 01:17:37,929
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a lot of stuff.

961
01:17:37,949 --> 01:17:46,496
[SPEAKER_02]: So I apologize, because that's a big one, though, because it does start to talk about this missing population, 18 to 28-year-olds, I would say.

962
01:17:47,296 --> 01:17:57,804
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we're doing that's really a big cornerstone in our office is we're doing a lot of work working with trying to address overdose rates and the trades.

963
01:17:58,565 --> 01:18:02,048
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've worked with Heidi.

964
01:18:03,048 --> 01:18:06,610
[SPEAKER_02]: last year did a great job of getting us in and we had that conversation.

965
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:10,072
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talked about dangers on the job.

966
01:18:10,112 --> 01:18:20,056
[SPEAKER_02]: We met with all the vocational students that were in co-op and we talked about injuries on the job, what to do if there's an injury from a tourniquet to how to use naloxone.

967
01:18:20,717 --> 01:18:27,860
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had some really great conversations, super bright nursing, CNA students and just really, really good conversations there.

968
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:32,082
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one way that we should be thinking about and continuing to partner about

969
01:18:32,428 --> 01:18:41,062
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, working with those employers who are taking on our students and what are they doing, what are their practices, we've created a toolkit for workers on a

970
01:18:41,409 --> 01:18:45,710
[SPEAKER_02]: how to understand the laws that pertain to them as well as to their employees.

971
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:47,550
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've done a lot of work around that.

972
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:50,471
[SPEAKER_02]: That gets at the population that's not going off to college.

973
01:18:50,791 --> 01:18:58,713
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that one thing that Danielle from Armstrong Ambulance would say is that the majority of the students were staying in Massachusetts.

974
01:18:59,213 --> 01:19:04,814
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's really about all of us thinking, all of our school systems thinking as a whole.

975
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:12,366
[SPEAKER_02]: about how to teach kids the same information across the board, so when they do go to school, they're still taking care of each other and helping each other out.

976
01:19:12,946 --> 01:19:13,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Benedetto?

977
01:19:14,547 --> 01:19:20,511
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're doing that training this year for CPI or First Aid, can we add back-end training?

978
01:19:21,031 --> 01:19:21,732
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already in it.

979
01:19:21,912 --> 01:19:23,673
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already there.

980
01:19:23,833 --> 01:19:26,495
[SPEAKER_03]: And is that for both the high school and the vocational schools?

981
01:19:26,555 --> 01:19:27,836
[SPEAKER_03]: It is seniors.

982
01:19:28,016 --> 01:19:28,917
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's great.

983
01:19:29,057 --> 01:19:30,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's wonderful.

984
01:19:30,678 --> 01:19:32,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Ternagli?

985
01:19:34,908 --> 01:19:49,960
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the, so in the school, I think that the reason that, as you stated many times, the reason that people do dueling so much is just because they think it's not bad, and also that it seems clean, and they don't think that it's hurtful.

986
01:19:50,541 --> 01:19:55,985
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I think is, would be really effective, similar to the 74% of students

987
01:19:58,244 --> 01:20:00,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford students are marijuana-free.

988
01:20:01,486 --> 01:20:05,067
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was really effective, just having the facts up there.

989
01:20:05,508 --> 01:20:22,196
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think something that could be really effective in the school, like maybe picking three or four facts from one Juul pod contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes, you'd be surprised how many people pay attention to that.

990
01:20:22,556 --> 01:20:23,897
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially, as you mentioned,

991
01:20:26,563 --> 01:20:27,624
[SPEAKER_00]: the facts are not out there.

992
01:20:28,184 --> 01:20:39,731
[SPEAKER_00]: And people would be really, it would change the perception of the problem at hand before it really takes root over time.

993
01:20:40,371 --> 01:20:41,232
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.

994
01:20:41,522 --> 01:20:56,656
[SPEAKER_02]: That's called social norming, and you just identified a scientific research study, evidence-based, but it works, and we have done posters in the past that we believe could have driven those numbers continually down, talking about how many students actually don't use marijuana.

995
01:20:57,097 --> 01:21:00,019
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting when you are someone who's using substances,

996
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:05,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Your peer group's probably using substances, thus the whole entire world is using substances.

997
01:21:05,765 --> 01:21:07,507
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something to be thinking about.

998
01:21:07,567 --> 01:21:13,033
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really important to get the facts out there and to really show that there's a lot of kids who just don't do this stuff, a lot of students.

999
01:21:14,915 --> 01:21:16,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you yield to Miss O'Brien?

1000
01:21:16,256 --> 01:21:16,416
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1001
01:21:16,836 --> 01:21:17,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Miss O'Brien.

1002
01:21:17,577 --> 01:21:23,081
[SPEAKER_16]: So back when I was in high school, I was part of the Above the Influence Club for a while with Miss Perry as my advisor.

1003
01:21:23,341 --> 01:21:26,704
[SPEAKER_16]: And we had Chris Herron come and speak to all the athletes in high school.

1004
01:21:27,024 --> 01:21:27,764
[SPEAKER_16]: It was mandatory.

1005
01:21:27,804 --> 01:21:31,687
[SPEAKER_16]: You couldn't even play the spring sport unless you went and saw Chris Herron.

1006
01:21:31,827 --> 01:21:41,855
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that was such a positive thing for us as high schoolers to see someone who's young and who overcame something and made something of his life, who

1007
01:21:42,335 --> 01:21:45,078
[SPEAKER_16]: was rich at one point and then totally went somewhere else.

1008
01:21:45,118 --> 01:21:53,786
[SPEAKER_16]: And I feel like that would be so beneficial to have a motivational speaker come in, not even just the athletes, but to everyone in the school should have the opportunity to come see someone.

1009
01:21:54,246 --> 01:21:56,688
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it's not just the athletes that fall out of track, you know?

1010
01:21:57,008 --> 01:21:57,569
[SPEAKER_16]: It's everyone.

1011
01:21:57,709 --> 01:22:00,251
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think a motivational speaker would be totally helpful.

1012
01:22:00,271 --> 01:22:04,435
[SPEAKER_16]: Because Chris Heron, I know, like my friends, when we left, we were like, oh my gosh.

1013
01:22:04,515 --> 01:22:05,016
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, wow.

1014
01:22:05,756 --> 01:22:09,838
[SPEAKER_16]: I know Mary Burke's daughter was on the lacrosse team with me and she, it was just amazing.

1015
01:22:09,878 --> 01:22:17,520
[SPEAKER_16]: It was an amazing experience and I think the children would really benefit from that and I think we should not even open it to just the high school, it should be the middle school too.

1016
01:22:18,441 --> 01:22:27,024
[SPEAKER_16]: And me being a young teacher and wanting to teach in Medford, I think we have such a strong community and we're so tight bonded and I'm so tight bonded with everyone in the community.

1017
01:22:27,044 --> 01:22:29,325
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel like I can talk to anyone here and I want to be able to

1018
01:22:31,606 --> 01:22:36,671
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how to put it, but have people be able to come and talk to the teachers and be comfortable with everyone.

1019
01:22:36,991 --> 01:22:40,674
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think a motivational speaker coming in would be just a great aspect.

1020
01:22:40,734 --> 01:22:41,435
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how Ms.

1021
01:22:41,455 --> 01:22:42,696
[SPEAKER_16]: Perry got Chris Hirons.

1022
01:22:42,716 --> 01:22:47,480
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe she could come about that again, but I know he does motivational speaking all the time.

1023
01:22:47,521 --> 01:22:48,281
[SPEAKER_16]: I follow him on Twitter.

1024
01:22:48,301 --> 01:22:49,202
[SPEAKER_16]: I think he's amazing.

1025
01:22:49,883 --> 01:22:51,184
[SPEAKER_16]: And yeah.

1026
01:22:51,204 --> 01:22:52,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Great recommendation, Hannah.

1027
01:22:53,946 --> 01:22:54,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Skerry.

1028
01:22:55,112 --> 01:23:00,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, through you to Sebastian, here's your next great story, next great lead in the Mustang News.

1029
01:23:00,641 --> 01:23:05,149
[SPEAKER_05]: It's their posters, you know, get it in print and shoot for our Pulitzer.

1030
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,960
[SPEAKER_19]: Betty can give you more stats.

1031
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,881
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I follow up on that?

1032
01:23:09,921 --> 01:23:21,223
[SPEAKER_19]: But actually, I wondered, I think that one in our report, that one stat about one jewel can have whatever it was, one jewel contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.

1033
01:23:21,703 --> 01:23:25,183
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just so striking that it is time for us.

1034
01:23:25,203 --> 01:23:26,504
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a graphics arts department.

1035
01:23:26,524 --> 01:23:28,664
[SPEAKER_19]: We can get some posters made up.

1036
01:23:28,784 --> 01:23:31,784
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that that would be incredibly valuable to right away get out.

1037
01:23:31,984 --> 01:23:34,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you should also know that one of those pods is like,

1038
01:23:35,547 --> 01:23:37,553
[SPEAKER_02]: $4.00, like four or five bucks.

1039
01:23:38,584 --> 01:23:41,145
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot cheaper than a pack.

1040
01:23:41,205 --> 01:23:44,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And no taxes, or is it a tax on that stuff?

1041
01:23:44,065 --> 01:23:45,046
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's online.

1042
01:23:45,146 --> 01:23:46,186
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if it's taxed.

1043
01:23:46,226 --> 01:23:47,526
[SPEAKER_15]: Conceals tax.

1044
01:23:47,566 --> 01:23:48,086
[SPEAKER_15]: Conceals tax.

1045
01:23:48,466 --> 01:23:52,147
[SPEAKER_15]: So our community, the Board of Health passed that you cannot sell to minors.

1046
01:23:52,187 --> 01:23:52,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1047
01:23:52,427 --> 01:23:52,787
[SPEAKER_15]: Bless you.

1048
01:23:52,807 --> 01:23:53,327
[SPEAKER_15]: God bless you.

1049
01:23:53,387 --> 01:23:54,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Bless you.

1050
01:23:54,868 --> 01:23:57,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Just one last point for Sebastian.

1051
01:23:57,428 --> 01:24:05,890
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a great article a couple of weeks ago on The Globe regarding dueling and its effects and what they know so far.

1052
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:07,851
[SPEAKER_05]: So you might want to research that.

1053
01:24:08,691 --> 01:24:11,973
[SPEAKER_05]: come up with your own conclusions and get a story out there for us.

1054
01:24:12,153 --> 01:24:12,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

1055
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:13,234
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1056
01:24:13,254 --> 01:24:13,394
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

1057
01:24:13,434 --> 01:24:13,914
[SPEAKER_19]: Vander Kloof.

1058
01:24:14,034 --> 01:24:22,180
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, no, I just wondered if we can also, I don't know whether I should make it as a form of a motion, but maybe we could talk to the graphic arts department and get some posters made.

1059
01:24:23,941 --> 01:24:25,321
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion on the floor, I second.

1060
01:24:26,522 --> 01:24:29,824
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motions that have been offered thus far, all those in favor?

1061
01:24:30,024 --> 01:24:30,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1062
01:24:30,585 --> 01:24:31,365
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1063
01:24:31,826 --> 01:24:34,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes, including a motivational speaker.

1064
01:24:38,113 --> 01:24:38,753
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1065
01:24:38,893 --> 01:24:39,733
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, through the chair.

1066
01:24:40,133 --> 01:24:41,774
[SPEAKER_15]: School committee man elect.

1067
01:24:42,574 --> 01:24:43,374
[SPEAKER_17]: I have two questions.

1068
01:24:44,314 --> 01:24:51,456
[SPEAKER_17]: The first is, so the alcohol use from the sixth to eighth grade dropped pretty precipitously from 2011 to 2013.

1069
01:24:52,236 --> 01:24:55,197
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was wondering what accounts for that drop.

1070
01:24:55,777 --> 01:24:59,177
[SPEAKER_17]: And the second thing I had is maybe just helping us understand the analytics.

1071
01:24:59,197 --> 01:25:01,638
[SPEAKER_17]: So you have children completing a survey

1072
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:12,566
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we have any sense of how many people are actually users but are concerned that if they fill out this survey with this information it will be seen by a teacher that they're handing it in?

1073
01:25:13,346 --> 01:25:15,087
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we have a sense of like heroin use?

1074
01:25:15,127 --> 01:25:18,149
[SPEAKER_17]: I know overdose is a serious issue in Medford.

1075
01:25:18,369 --> 01:25:23,212
[SPEAKER_17]: So do we have a sense of underage heroin overdoses in Medford right now?

1076
01:25:23,232 --> 01:25:25,433
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no underage heroin overdoses in Medford.

1077
01:25:27,034 --> 01:25:31,377
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an individual who was 19 that overdosed and died in Medford.

1078
01:25:31,397 --> 01:25:32,578
[SPEAKER_02]: They were from another community.

1079
01:25:32,718 --> 01:25:33,618
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something to know.

1080
01:25:37,441 --> 01:25:39,342
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have it here at the bottom.

1081
01:25:39,442 --> 01:25:48,067
[SPEAKER_02]: But these numbers are so small that it's very, you have to really think about that, that this is like points.

1082
01:25:49,282 --> 01:25:51,485
[SPEAKER_02]: 1% of the entire population that took it reported.

1083
01:25:51,505 --> 01:25:52,587
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be one student.

1084
01:25:53,108 --> 01:25:55,312
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's something to think about when you're looking at that data.

1085
01:25:55,793 --> 01:25:56,394
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's there.

1086
01:25:57,656 --> 01:25:59,479
[SPEAKER_02]: But your question is about.

1087
01:26:01,029 --> 01:26:03,391
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, what was the drop?

1088
01:26:03,711 --> 01:26:05,093
[SPEAKER_17]: The drop was pretty significant.

1089
01:26:05,113 --> 01:26:07,735
[SPEAKER_17]: If you have 10%, that's a significant selection.

1090
01:26:07,755 --> 01:26:08,376
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a significant drop.

1091
01:26:08,416 --> 01:26:13,340
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we saw at that time was we saw an increase in parental monitoring.

1092
01:26:14,281 --> 01:26:23,409
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were to look at the risk and protective factors, we talked about in 2011, there were some protective factors that were very low in the middle schools.

1093
01:26:23,789 --> 01:26:28,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the next year, they were exactly even with their sister scores.

1094
01:26:29,054 --> 01:26:39,783
[SPEAKER_02]: So the deal was is that there were many opportunities for rewards if you do something in the school, but there weren't very many opportunities.

1095
01:26:40,364 --> 01:26:44,988
[SPEAKER_02]: So when those two came together and they were evened out, we talked about it at the school committee meeting.

1096
01:26:45,288 --> 01:26:46,910
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about it with the principals.

1097
01:26:47,230 --> 01:26:50,413
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a whole influx of new activities after school.

1098
01:26:50,913 --> 01:26:55,775
[SPEAKER_02]: activities that started to happen, those numbers became aligned and we saw that number drop.

1099
01:26:55,795 --> 01:26:59,477
[SPEAKER_02]: So parents were monitoring their kids more closely.

1100
01:26:59,957 --> 01:27:04,419
[SPEAKER_02]: The schools addressed some of the pro-social things that needed to be addressed in the community.

1101
01:27:05,139 --> 01:27:10,641
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a real sort of like chasm of everybody working together, I think, and that really helped drive those numbers down.

1102
01:27:11,942 --> 01:27:16,124
[SPEAKER_17]: And do you have a sense of how many kids are using but don't report on the survey?

1103
01:27:16,768 --> 01:27:20,362
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just sort of a given with these surveys, right?

1104
01:27:22,307 --> 01:27:31,630
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest with you, a lot of people who are using substances know very well that they don't want to be using substances, and so they do self-report pretty accurately on these surveys.

1105
01:27:31,930 --> 01:27:41,453
[SPEAKER_02]: They may not want to be forthcoming with someone that knows them and may feel shame if they were to report, but when it's anonymous, it's secretive.

1106
01:27:41,533 --> 01:27:43,253
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually do fill them out pretty accurately.

1107
01:27:43,273 --> 01:27:47,815
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's what, nationally, that's what the story has been.

1108
01:27:48,795 --> 01:27:52,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the exact scientific fact for you, but that's what I do know.

1109
01:27:53,736 --> 01:27:54,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

1110
01:27:54,356 --> 01:27:56,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion to receive this report?

1111
01:27:56,277 --> 01:27:56,917
[SPEAKER_08]: One more question, Ms.

1112
01:27:56,957 --> 01:27:57,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Cugno.

1113
01:27:57,417 --> 01:28:08,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I was just thinking of the bullet points that we were talking about, whether it be Sebastian or both of you, is the other one about getting into our vehicle with someone who's been vaping.

1114
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:11,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, which is very important and it's very serious.

1115
01:28:12,942 --> 01:28:23,845
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't and I think that would be a bullet point really put out there, because I don't think people are aware of how serious that could be, because we're you know, we've been trained in our mind.

1116
01:28:24,005 --> 01:28:29,747
[SPEAKER_08]: And as as kids, we've been trained in our minds to is, you know, you don't get into a vehicle with someone who's been drinking.

1117
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:30,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1118
01:28:30,387 --> 01:28:31,568
[SPEAKER_08]: No one's been talking about this.

1119
01:28:31,648 --> 01:28:32,748
[SPEAKER_08]: This is, you know, newer.

1120
01:28:33,188 --> 01:28:35,709
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's definitely a point we need to put out there.

1121
01:28:36,009 --> 01:28:38,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it's a really important one to talk about for sure.

1122
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:40,071
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1123
01:28:40,111 --> 01:28:43,592
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion this report being received and placed on file, all those in favor?

1124
01:28:44,033 --> 01:28:44,133
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1125
01:28:44,453 --> 01:28:45,093
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1126
01:28:45,393 --> 01:28:46,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

1127
01:28:46,114 --> 01:28:46,454
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1128
01:28:52,456 --> 01:28:55,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, motion to revert to the regular order of business.

1129
01:28:55,979 --> 01:28:56,779
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1130
01:28:56,859 --> 01:28:57,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1131
01:28:57,259 --> 01:28:58,120
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1132
01:28:58,600 --> 01:28:59,401
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1133
01:28:59,881 --> 01:29:05,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Report one, recommendation to approve Medford High School, Medford-Volk Tech High School graduation date and location.

1134
01:29:05,445 --> 01:29:05,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Move approval.

1135
01:29:05,945 --> 01:29:06,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to approve.

1136
01:29:06,726 --> 01:29:09,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Superintendent, you want me just to announce the date?

1137
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:20,295
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we can just make one quick comment, as we've done this at this place every year for a long time now, and the reason we need to approve it so early is that if we have snow days,

1138
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:22,380
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, we've locked in the date.

1139
01:29:23,001 --> 01:29:26,762
[SPEAKER_18]: So we don't have to have, you know, so many days.

1140
01:29:26,882 --> 01:29:29,063
[SPEAKER_18]: But if there are no snow days, we don't have to worry about it.

1141
01:29:29,703 --> 01:29:39,406
[SPEAKER_18]: And the other thing that I just will let you know is that Mr. William Cummings of the Cummings Foundation will speak at graduation in addition to the normal speakers.

1142
01:29:39,766 --> 01:29:40,286
[SPEAKER_15]: That's exciting.

1143
01:29:41,007 --> 01:29:41,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Excellent.

1144
01:29:41,367 --> 01:29:45,008
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's June 6th, all those parents out there, at 6 p.m.

1145
01:29:45,048 --> 01:29:47,309
[SPEAKER_15]: at the Gancher Center at Tufts University.

1146
01:29:48,629 --> 01:29:51,072
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to approve by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

1147
01:29:51,112 --> 01:29:51,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Kreatz.

1148
01:29:51,593 --> 01:29:52,394
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1149
01:29:52,414 --> 01:29:52,955
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1150
01:29:53,155 --> 01:29:53,816
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1151
01:29:54,016 --> 01:29:54,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1152
01:29:56,739 --> 01:29:58,081
[SPEAKER_15]: Financial report, Ms.

1153
01:29:58,101 --> 01:29:58,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Patterson.

1154
01:30:02,628 --> 01:30:09,152
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is our first quarterly or close to one third of the year report on our financials.

1155
01:30:09,953 --> 01:30:25,563
[SPEAKER_04]: The general fund operating budget for FY 18 is fifty six million four hundred thirty one thousand, of which year to date we have spent forty two percent, forty two point nine percent, which is the total of twenty four million two hundred and fifteen thousand seven eighty six.

1156
01:30:26,063 --> 01:30:30,226
[SPEAKER_04]: And that includes both our expenditures and our encumbrances, which is

1157
01:30:30,646 --> 01:30:34,230
[SPEAKER_04]: reserving funds for anticipated and projected expenses.

1158
01:30:35,271 --> 01:30:48,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So of the amount spent to date, our 10-month biweekly employees have received nine of their checks since August 28th, with an additional special run in October to accommodate the anticipated number of checks per calendar year.

1159
01:30:49,457 --> 01:30:55,544
[SPEAKER_04]: And all 12-month employees have received 11 of their paychecks since July 1, the first start of the new fiscal year.

1160
01:30:56,685 --> 01:31:02,492
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have many staff members out on maternity leave with some additional expected in the spring.

1161
01:31:02,612 --> 01:31:03,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently, we have nine.

1162
01:31:04,254 --> 01:31:06,176
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are some significant increases.

1163
01:31:07,077 --> 01:31:12,382
[SPEAKER_04]: coverages that we're maintaining that is also long-term sub-capacities.

1164
01:31:13,142 --> 01:31:25,073
[SPEAKER_04]: And while there has been significant transition for teaching and other staff members during this school year, we have been able to fill the positions based on the program needs and will continue to do so as those arise.

1165
01:31:26,854 --> 01:31:29,355
[SPEAKER_04]: The business office is fully staffed.

1166
01:31:29,735 --> 01:31:35,057
[SPEAKER_04]: We transitioned from some various leaves and had significant turnover over the summer.

1167
01:31:35,577 --> 01:31:43,559
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are in the process of reclassifying our payroll codes to reflect correct budget items and be in line with that.

1168
01:31:44,021 --> 01:31:46,582
[SPEAKER_04]: where they were reflected for the departmental charges.

1169
01:31:47,442 --> 01:32:03,508
[SPEAKER_04]: We are also excited and encouraged to be rolling out and implementing a new automated onboarding process for the hiring and tracking that will greatly improve our laborious process for new hires and streamlining documentation.

1170
01:32:03,868 --> 01:32:10,110
[SPEAKER_04]: This will also be rolled out to current employees for data changes and updates, and it is a

1171
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:16,100
[SPEAKER_04]: subsequent system for the current attendance ASOP system that we use with Frontline.

1172
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,163
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will also include a mobile app.

1173
01:32:18,744 --> 01:32:21,289
[SPEAKER_04]: So that will greatly improve utilization.

1174
01:32:22,749 --> 01:32:49,805
[SPEAKER_04]: So as we continue to respond to the DESE, Department of Ed chart of account change structures, as well as additional reporting components that they have for us, we have to report and track expenses by a number of different areas, which include by school, by function code, by category, district wide, and expanding out to individual grants, the higher level grants, such as Title I and special education.

1175
01:32:50,950 --> 01:33:04,123
[SPEAKER_04]: So within the operating budget where some budget columns may be zero, the planned cost projections are included in those breakout items and the balances within each function remain to be positive.

1176
01:33:04,863 --> 01:33:10,209
[SPEAKER_04]: So we please also note that the encumbrance column, it does include amounts that we have

1177
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:16,273
[SPEAKER_04]: included our best projections for year end expenditures.

1178
01:33:16,693 --> 01:33:24,658
[SPEAKER_04]: So those will continue to be monitored, liquidated and updated as costs are trued up, as the invoices come in and actual payments are.

1179
01:33:25,176 --> 01:33:25,616
[SPEAKER_04]: relieved.

1180
01:33:26,537 --> 01:33:31,501
[SPEAKER_04]: So included with the summary are some of the key program areas within our general fund.

1181
01:33:32,401 --> 01:33:35,684
[SPEAKER_04]: The first of which and is the largest component of our budget is salaries.

1182
01:33:36,784 --> 01:33:44,530
[SPEAKER_04]: In fiscal year 2018 we have two salary increments that were awarded for the collective bargaining units.

1183
01:33:44,630 --> 01:33:47,232
[SPEAKER_04]: The first was in July or and or the start of their

1184
01:33:48,272 --> 01:33:57,136
[SPEAKER_04]: contract and the second increase will be in January for the appropriate CBA groups and that will be another 1%.

1185
01:33:58,736 --> 01:34:13,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So the undistributed allocation will be dispersed among the budget adjustments for different program areas so as we identify the increases in certain areas we will be reallocating some of those amounts for

1186
01:34:14,662 --> 01:34:17,384
[SPEAKER_04]: personnel changes, retirement buybacks and the such.

1187
01:34:19,225 --> 01:34:21,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Another area of interest is security.

1188
01:34:22,087 --> 01:34:27,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Large investments have been made to replace and repair the security cameras throughout the district at all buildings.

1189
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:35,974
[SPEAKER_04]: So the amount of $194,949 within the budget is earmarked for the security program reporting area.

1190
01:34:36,515 --> 01:34:40,337
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it will most likely be shifted to a capital account once appropriated.

1191
01:34:42,025 --> 01:34:48,491
[SPEAKER_04]: We expect that the projects will be completed at all schools by mid-December and we will follow up with a detailed report.

1192
01:34:49,492 --> 01:34:56,859
[SPEAKER_04]: There have been many schools that have finalized the completion of those repairs and we will be updating as they

1193
01:34:57,779 --> 01:34:58,680
[SPEAKER_04]: finalized as well.

1194
01:34:59,281 --> 01:35:18,963
[SPEAKER_04]: So security in the buildings is a priority and the district continues to demonstrate its commitment to ensuring safety in the multiple areas and that includes our staffing, training our staff members, cameras, security cameras, and identification stops at entrance locations which include the Raptor license scanning and name tag system.

1195
01:35:20,831 --> 01:35:32,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Our technology is another significant area where the committee decided to infuse the system with significant funding at each of the school systems, at each school building.

1196
01:35:33,243 --> 01:35:43,792
[SPEAKER_04]: There was 15,000 earmarked for the high school level, 5,000 for Curtis Tufts, 15,000 for the middle schools, and 13,000 for each elementary school, which was significant.

1197
01:35:44,533 --> 01:35:59,461
[SPEAKER_04]: We utilized those funds and used some high volume discounts along with state bid pricing to maximize the investment within those technology area and rolled out over the summer to have the carts and units available for the start of school.

1198
01:36:00,061 --> 01:36:07,545
[SPEAKER_04]: So in total we had 455 devices, new devices for this school year that were rolled out for use in each of the buildings.

1199
01:36:08,982 --> 01:36:26,176
[SPEAKER_04]: And additionally, within technology, we just received the E-rate approval that will further improve connectivity district-wide, and we're hoping the matching dollars that were requested from the city will be approved, and we'll be able to continue the technology investment throughout school year 2018.

1200
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:32,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Transportation continues to be a large item.

1201
01:36:32,961 --> 01:36:41,784
[SPEAKER_04]: We are currently in year three of the original three-year contract with Eastern Bus, and we have an additional two years locked in at specified rates for that contract.

1202
01:36:42,564 --> 01:36:45,845
[SPEAKER_04]: The budget reflects an anticipated reduction of one bus.

1203
01:36:46,446 --> 01:36:50,107
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we did have to bring bus number 18 back into

1204
01:36:51,127 --> 01:36:58,153
[SPEAKER_04]: the cycle due to the shift in newcomers programs and so we've had to utilize the additional bus for that.

1205
01:36:58,793 --> 01:37:05,499
[SPEAKER_04]: So it shows a negative amount within that category based on the need for additional transportation.

1206
01:37:06,758 --> 01:37:28,276
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have absorbed the cost for students that attend the Minuteman Vocational School, and the amount we expect will be covered by the reduced enrollment in the tuition, so where we had projected additional students going out, and the offset coming in for the transportation will net itself out.

1207
01:37:29,417 --> 01:37:41,419
[SPEAKER_04]: We currently provide after-school buses to the middle schools and that's per contract that was identified in the original contract three buses per day and that's for 70 days throughout the school year.

1208
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:57,263
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also indicated that should the elementary schools be considering additional after-school programs there would be some additional costs realized with that and we would need to work with the provider for the levels of

1209
01:37:59,704 --> 01:38:06,248
[SPEAKER_04]: and participation and timing of those trips because the routes are all intertwined and combined.

1210
01:38:06,308 --> 01:38:17,817
[SPEAKER_04]: So there may be possibility for an additional contractor at that point if it was decided and determined to go forward with that additional expense in the transportation area.

1211
01:38:19,186 --> 01:38:33,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Our utilities, which covers natural gas, electricity, water, we encumber the utilities based on historical years of usage, and we budget conservatively for unexpected occurrences.

1212
01:38:33,969 --> 01:38:36,849
[SPEAKER_04]: So our natural gas rates have been very favorable.

1213
01:38:37,449 --> 01:38:40,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Utilization has been lower due to milder winters.

1214
01:38:41,150 --> 01:38:47,991
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we still have not experienced the cold months for this fiscal year, so we're not quite sure how that will land.

1215
01:38:48,891 --> 01:39:02,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Electricity continues to be volatile in the marketplace, and we will be expecting a slightly higher rate beginning next fiscal year, which we have locked in with City Hall working with the Power Options Company.

1216
01:39:03,514 --> 01:39:12,156
[SPEAKER_04]: So our current rate is slightly lower, which is for the supply cost at .0882 per kilowatt hour.

1217
01:39:12,716 --> 01:39:14,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving into next fiscal year,

1218
01:39:14,918 --> 01:39:24,201
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll have .0931, so definitely moving forward as we budget and plan for that, we will need to budget some increases in that area.

1219
01:39:25,421 --> 01:39:29,522
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have encumbered the entire line item for that account.

1220
01:39:29,662 --> 01:39:39,385
[SPEAKER_04]: It has typically gone to the very end of that particular expense, so we wanna maintain a conservative estimate and show that fully expended.

1221
01:39:40,586 --> 01:39:48,255
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in summary, the first financial report shows that the expenditures are in line with our budget projections.

1222
01:39:48,555 --> 01:39:58,346
[SPEAKER_04]: We will continue to monitor and review them, and we constantly look at consolidating purchases, utilizing state bids when we can.

1223
01:39:58,987 --> 01:40:01,869
[SPEAKER_04]: and the like, and identifying savings wherever possible.

1224
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:15,259
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to, again, thank City Hall, my counterparts at the hall, that communication, cooperation has been very effective in helping us accomplish what we need to get done.

1225
01:40:15,299 --> 01:40:15,760
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1226
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:18,642
[SPEAKER_19]: Christina, I had one question.

1227
01:40:18,762 --> 01:40:24,186
[SPEAKER_19]: Could you please explain what you mean by we are reclassifying payroll codes to reflect correct budget lines?

1228
01:40:24,655 --> 01:40:38,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so our payroll system is not linked with our financial system, so we outsource payroll, so we have to identify a payroll code that is crosswalked to our general ledger code, a financial software code.

1229
01:40:38,698 --> 01:40:50,620
[SPEAKER_04]: So those codes, which was a much smaller code number, may not necessarily be aligned with what our either newly identified budget financial account code is, general ledger account.

1230
01:40:51,080 --> 01:41:06,145
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going through now and really scouring those areas to look at some anomalies that might be occurring and to make sure that where we budgeted individuals based on department school-wide that they are correctly classified in the payroll code.

1231
01:41:06,265 --> 01:41:14,068
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so it doesn't mean that somebody who was added to the business office or transferred in the role was given different classification?

1232
01:41:14,528 --> 01:41:15,668
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no.

1233
01:41:15,708 --> 01:41:17,769
[SPEAKER_04]: This is strictly an accounting function.

1234
01:41:18,109 --> 01:41:22,811
[SPEAKER_04]: So identifying the crosswalk from our payroll system to our general fund accounting system.

1235
01:41:26,552 --> 01:41:26,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

1236
01:41:26,732 --> 01:41:27,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Kurtz?

1237
01:41:27,633 --> 01:41:28,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, thank you, Christine.

1238
01:41:29,013 --> 01:41:30,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the reports, excellent.

1239
01:41:30,614 --> 01:41:31,794
[SPEAKER_10]: I just have one question.

1240
01:41:32,274 --> 01:41:34,375
[SPEAKER_10]: It does mention, I was gonna ask about the cameras.

1241
01:41:34,795 --> 01:41:39,116
[SPEAKER_10]: So it mentions that a large investment was made to replace and repair security cameras.

1242
01:41:39,657 --> 01:41:43,378
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know a lot of us were getting emails throughout the fall

1243
01:41:43,818 --> 01:41:47,537
[SPEAKER_10]: where a lot of parents are very concerned because a lot of cameras were out.

1244
01:41:47,923 --> 01:41:49,083
[SPEAKER_10]: and they weren't operating.

1245
01:41:49,463 --> 01:41:58,225
[SPEAKER_10]: So are there any cameras that are still in need of repair or were all the cameras that were malfunctioning and not operating?

1246
01:41:58,666 --> 01:41:59,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Were they all repaired?

1247
01:42:00,366 --> 01:42:08,188
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've addressed all of the inoperable cameras that were the critical areas for observation.

1248
01:42:08,688 --> 01:42:13,309
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of those have been addressed with the investment that we have provided.

1249
01:42:13,749 --> 01:42:17,790
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not all currently complete as the contractor is still working on them.

1250
01:42:18,371 --> 01:42:26,901
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have several teams at several locations and they anticipate being complete in the next couple of weeks.

1251
01:42:27,985 --> 01:42:30,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask a point of clarification?

1252
01:42:30,506 --> 01:42:30,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1253
01:42:32,686 --> 01:42:35,027
[SPEAKER_03]: So you said the key point cameras.

1254
01:42:35,147 --> 01:42:40,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean all cameras are now online and working or just key points?

1255
01:42:40,688 --> 01:42:41,308
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

1256
01:42:41,428 --> 01:42:50,710
[SPEAKER_04]: As I mentioned, repairs and replacements have not all been done to this date, to date right now for reporting back to you.

1257
01:42:51,490 --> 01:42:54,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of the schools have been, and they are in process right now.

1258
01:42:55,131 --> 01:43:00,193
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where we will be finalizing the update in a couple of weeks when they are complete.

1259
01:43:00,513 --> 01:43:02,834
[SPEAKER_04]: So they did, I believe, the Roberts is complete.

1260
01:43:03,554 --> 01:43:13,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the other highly critical areas, but the larger projects that were greater in scale are still ongoing.

1261
01:43:13,478 --> 01:43:16,739
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're in the process of being repaired and replaced.

1262
01:43:16,993 --> 01:43:19,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a completion hopeful date?

1263
01:43:20,316 --> 01:43:20,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Two weeks.

1264
01:43:23,398 --> 01:43:29,723
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all cameras within the district will be up and running and functioning appropriately?

1265
01:43:30,624 --> 01:43:34,247
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that it's really important to understand that cameras are fragile.

1266
01:43:35,483 --> 01:43:38,686
[SPEAKER_18]: And that every year, we're going to have to allocate money for this.

1267
01:43:39,267 --> 01:43:44,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Because lightning strikes, all kinds of things take place that are beyond our control.

1268
01:43:45,233 --> 01:43:51,059
[SPEAKER_18]: And we can go all year long and then find that we need cameras that have to be replaced going into the school year.

1269
01:43:52,464 --> 01:43:59,891
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the key thing, you know, apropos to your question is, is that are we covering the areas that people need to be, have covered, that people can see?

1270
01:43:59,911 --> 01:44:00,611
[SPEAKER_18]: The answer is yes.

1271
01:44:02,393 --> 01:44:04,815
[SPEAKER_18]: And we'll try to, you know, continually

1272
01:44:05,826 --> 01:44:07,447
[SPEAKER_18]: prioritize as we go forward.

1273
01:44:07,487 --> 01:44:17,334
[SPEAKER_18]: If a camera goes down, we certainly want to ensure that a key area is covered, so rather than one that might be a duplicate of an existing area.

1274
01:44:17,814 --> 01:44:22,938
[SPEAKER_18]: But for the most part, in the middle of December, we believe everything will be fixed.

1275
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:38,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as another follow-up, I know that Attorney Bill O'Keefe offered to supply us with extra cameras, and even if we have them as a stash of backup cameras, he's more than willing to donate them.

1276
01:44:38,952 --> 01:44:51,963
[SPEAKER_03]: He has in the past, and he has more to donate, so I'm making a motion now that the superintendent reach out to him and just see if they're functioning with our system now, and if it's appropriate to have them as backup.

1277
01:44:52,243 --> 01:44:55,144
[SPEAKER_18]: So let me answer that before we go too far down the road.

1278
01:44:56,144 --> 01:45:00,306
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. O'Keefe did provide a substantial number, 30 additional cameras this year.

1279
01:45:00,806 --> 01:45:02,747
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of them are not compatible with what we need.

1280
01:45:03,307 --> 01:45:08,809
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of them can be used for limited purposes, but given what we're doing right now and given the upgrade in technology,

1281
01:45:09,789 --> 01:45:18,376
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, what's coming out of that institution that Bill gets it from, uh, is not necessarily compatible with what we've got.

1282
01:45:18,416 --> 01:45:19,477
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a few that can be.

1283
01:45:19,978 --> 01:45:23,080
[SPEAKER_18]: So, we've got to screen them out, but we really can't be overly dependent on that.

1284
01:45:23,561 --> 01:45:37,732
[SPEAKER_18]: We appreciate what Bill's done, but on the other hand, we've got to be careful that, uh, they're mostly inside cameras, and the things that deal with outside cameras are very different, and we're also dealing with a different way of, uh, of a transmission, uh, than we previously did.

1285
01:45:39,390 --> 01:45:44,494
[SPEAKER_18]: We can use them periodically, but it's not a one-to-one kind of application, but we do appreciate it.

1286
01:45:44,554 --> 01:45:46,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I also make a motion to send him a thank you note.

1287
01:45:47,676 --> 01:45:49,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we did once, but I'll send it again.

1288
01:45:49,297 --> 01:45:55,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Consistently over the years providing us with any technology that comes to his hands.

1289
01:45:56,642 --> 01:45:57,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Still moved.

1290
01:45:58,063 --> 01:45:59,424
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion for approval?

1291
01:45:59,544 --> 01:46:00,285
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a few questions.

1292
01:46:00,425 --> 01:46:01,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I thought you already asked.

1293
01:46:01,806 --> 01:46:02,626
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was just on that.

1294
01:46:02,766 --> 01:46:04,848
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was the security issue.

1295
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:11,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted some clarity on the business office team and now that it's fully staffed, what types of movement happened?

1296
01:46:11,932 --> 01:46:13,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Were there any positions added?

1297
01:46:13,894 --> 01:46:14,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just curious.

1298
01:46:15,174 --> 01:46:19,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we talked about a HR person at one point, the superintendent mentioned something like that.

1299
01:46:19,197 --> 01:46:21,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I just was wondering what that looks like now.

1300
01:46:21,759 --> 01:46:23,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe we could even get like,

1301
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:25,722
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a plan.

1302
01:46:25,822 --> 01:46:26,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.

1303
01:46:27,143 --> 01:46:27,883
[SPEAKER_04]: No, absolutely.

1304
01:46:28,404 --> 01:46:32,007
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had a maternity leave that was not covered.

1305
01:46:32,727 --> 01:46:33,908
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were understaffed.

1306
01:46:34,409 --> 01:46:40,634
[SPEAKER_04]: We also had transition from one of our team members who went to another department within the school.

1307
01:46:41,174 --> 01:46:44,938
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had to fill another payroll position.

1308
01:46:45,078 --> 01:46:46,399
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's been nothing added.

1309
01:46:46,919 --> 01:46:49,782
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been backfilling and trying to maintain and keep

1310
01:46:50,382 --> 01:46:53,207
[SPEAKER_04]: keep the level of service with less people.

1311
01:46:53,848 --> 01:47:00,641
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was nobody added except a replacement for an open position that had transferred.

1312
01:47:01,418 --> 01:47:09,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we see that chart anyway, just so the committee members, we have an idea of what the roles are, who's in those roles.

1313
01:47:09,502 --> 01:47:17,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that would be helpful, because if we have any questions moving forward, of course we'd go through the superintendent, but you know, it's just to know.

1314
01:47:17,485 --> 01:47:18,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Names and job titles.

1315
01:47:18,546 --> 01:47:20,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that would be great, thank you.

1316
01:47:21,576 --> 01:47:28,983
[SPEAKER_18]: We do have expectations of coming forward with a proposal as the year progresses to enhance our human resources capacity.

1317
01:47:29,483 --> 01:47:38,191
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's become a major, major area and you cannot continue to just simply treat it as a byproduct of everything else going on.

1318
01:47:38,251 --> 01:47:41,494
[SPEAKER_18]: So, that will come forward as a major proposal and we'll have that discussion.

1319
01:47:44,194 --> 01:47:58,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I just also want to speak about the community schools budget, and I know that the committee approved almost two years ago about having it quarterly, so just as a friendly reminder that I'd like to see that coming forward soon.

1320
01:47:59,010 --> 01:47:59,830
[SPEAKER_03]: We will.

1321
01:47:59,991 --> 01:48:00,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1322
01:48:00,872 --> 01:48:06,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we can even add it to the list of items on the back of our agenda so we don't forget, because I might forget.

1323
01:48:08,359 --> 01:48:10,460
[SPEAKER_18]: I doubt you're going to forget.

1324
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:13,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report?

1325
01:48:13,642 --> 01:48:16,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to accept the report, place it on file.

1326
01:48:16,584 --> 01:48:17,225
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

1327
01:48:17,285 --> 01:48:17,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1328
01:48:17,425 --> 01:48:17,905
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

1329
01:48:17,925 --> 01:48:18,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion granted.

1330
01:48:18,466 --> 01:48:19,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank You Christine.

1331
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:36,561
[SPEAKER_15]: Item number three, report on bilingual education legislation.

1332
01:48:36,601 --> 01:48:37,501
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Superintendent.

1333
01:48:38,261 --> 01:48:49,744
[SPEAKER_18]: So, as you probably know, the state legislature has approved an option for school districts to incorporate bilingual education into the existing SEI format.

1334
01:48:50,604 --> 01:48:59,926
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, 15 years ago, Ron Unz, who came from California, pushed a initiative petition, which he previously had some success in Arizona and California,

1335
01:49:00,546 --> 01:49:04,069
[SPEAKER_18]: and Massachusetts decided that it would adopt it as well.

1336
01:49:04,990 --> 01:49:11,916
[SPEAKER_18]: It was given great support from John Silbert at the time, and also Mitt Romney, who was a gubernatorial candidate, and it carried its way.

1337
01:49:12,837 --> 01:49:15,479
[SPEAKER_18]: Since the time it's been implemented, there's been mixed results.

1338
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:18,781
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

1339
01:49:18,801 --> 01:49:22,961
[SPEAKER_18]: But it comes with that whole idea that, you know, everyone should speak English, and we believe they should.

1340
01:49:23,041 --> 01:49:33,604
[SPEAKER_18]: But how to learn to speak English, especially to learn subjects that require deep cognitive knowledge or cognitive language, is not so easily done.

1341
01:49:34,804 --> 01:49:38,605
[SPEAKER_18]: And there are reasons for blending and doing things a little bit differently.

1342
01:49:40,526 --> 01:49:42,388
[SPEAKER_18]: We obviously are looking at that.

1343
01:49:42,428 --> 01:49:51,295
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be waiting for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to give us the latest guidelines as they see them, and we haven't seen them yet.

1344
01:49:51,335 --> 01:49:55,459
[SPEAKER_18]: We probably won't see them until either late spring or perhaps even into the summer.

1345
01:49:56,079 --> 01:50:00,563
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I doubt there's going to be much done in the next fiscal year.

1346
01:50:01,884 --> 01:50:17,462
[SPEAKER_18]: We are going to look at the blend of programs, and Paul is going to come up in a minute and talk about that, and how it comes together so that we can take advantage of the law where it's appropriate, while at the same time not lose track of situations which are best served by the current SEI.

1347
01:50:18,443 --> 01:50:21,526
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, as you probably know, our teachers have

1348
01:50:22,307 --> 01:50:35,057
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been working to get SEI endorsements, which are required now, for teachers who work with students who have EL requirements, and the vast majority of faculty members do, especially in the core academic areas.

1349
01:50:35,377 --> 01:50:48,207
[SPEAKER_18]: However, there's still some gaps, and there's still a need to continue pushing that as people receive students who have this English language need, to make sure that the teachers are fully prepared for them.

1350
01:50:50,189 --> 01:50:56,472
[SPEAKER_18]: We also have the issue of dealing with the distribution of students with EL, and we're going to look at that.

1351
01:50:56,572 --> 01:50:58,112
[SPEAKER_18]: We did some distribution this year.

1352
01:50:58,753 --> 01:51:00,133
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll have some comment about that.

1353
01:51:00,633 --> 01:51:06,056
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not an easy subject, because as you move people around, you create, you solve one problem, you create another.

1354
01:51:06,506 --> 01:51:18,575
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to provide some options for you in the beginning of the year, sometime in January, so you can look at what options are available to you and what it means financially and what it means programmatically.

1355
01:51:19,395 --> 01:51:25,920
[SPEAKER_18]: But tonight, we want to give you an idea about the law, the pros, the cons of it, and some of the other things that Paul has put together.

1356
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:32,745
[SPEAKER_18]: So with permission, Paul, if you come on up and give us a discussion on this topic.

1357
01:51:33,626 --> 01:51:34,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, everyone.

1358
01:51:36,033 --> 01:51:43,639
[SPEAKER_12]: So, this bill allows districts to choose what type of programming works best for their communities.

1359
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:54,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Unlike the old TBE, they had it set up where it was mandatory if you had 20 or more students who spoke in a language group.

1360
01:51:55,988 --> 01:52:04,272
[SPEAKER_12]: During that time, students in their first year, it was 20% of instruction was in English, 80% was in the target language.

1361
01:52:04,312 --> 01:52:06,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Year two, it was a 50-50 split.

1362
01:52:06,633 --> 01:52:11,496
[SPEAKER_12]: And then year three, it was 20% in the native language and 80% in the target language.

1363
01:52:17,358 --> 01:52:22,201
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't know what guidance the state's going to come out with regarding this.

1364
01:52:22,761 --> 01:52:30,585
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to look at licensure because all of the bilingual licenses were put on hold by DESE 15 years ago when that ended.

1365
01:52:32,066 --> 01:52:34,207
[SPEAKER_12]: So we don't know what their requirements will be.

1366
01:52:34,827 --> 01:52:35,507
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't know

1367
01:52:37,348 --> 01:52:39,849
[SPEAKER_12]: really what their guidance will be with programming.

1368
01:52:40,809 --> 01:52:47,131
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't, my understanding of it as the bill is written is it doesn't have to be a full-on program as it was in the past.

1369
01:52:47,591 --> 01:52:55,654
[SPEAKER_12]: We can now have just individual classes that can support our students who speak other languages.

1370
01:52:55,774 --> 01:53:03,797
[SPEAKER_12]: So as Mr. Belson and I were talking about this initially, we're thinking, you know, start out when we look at our language groups, Portuguese is our highest,

1371
01:53:05,197 --> 01:53:08,078
[SPEAKER_12]: highest number of speakers at the high school.

1372
01:53:08,938 --> 01:53:16,059
[SPEAKER_12]: Our high school students are at a disadvantage because they have a finite period of time in which to learn language, pass all of their MCAS tests.

1373
01:53:16,079 --> 01:53:31,922
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we were to introduce something here in Medford, we would look at those protocol, the protocol set out by the Department of Ed, look at our student population, which again, changes on a regular basis, and make those decisions at that time.

1374
01:53:34,955 --> 01:53:39,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Esconia, I know that we really don't have a lot of questions to ask.

1375
01:53:40,217 --> 01:53:41,338
[SPEAKER_08]: You won't have the answers to them.

1376
01:53:41,958 --> 01:53:46,200
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess I don't know why this has never even come before.

1377
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:50,522
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm going to ask you a question when students come to the place and they speak a different language.

1378
01:53:51,863 --> 01:54:06,492
[SPEAKER_08]: They I know that we have specific classes to go into, but are they partnered with anybody in the high school themselves like like to go to lunch with or anything like that that already that are here in our system as students and speak both languages?

1379
01:54:06,953 --> 01:54:10,595
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason I said that is I don't know why it's never really hit me.

1380
01:54:10,995 --> 01:54:15,318
[SPEAKER_08]: But many years ago, going here, we had students that came in from Italy.

1381
01:54:15,338 --> 01:54:17,420
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember my teacher actually asking me,

1382
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:24,284
[SPEAKER_08]: to see if that student could, well, at that time our schedules were different, so that student had to come to all the classes I went to.

1383
01:54:24,985 --> 01:54:34,812
[SPEAKER_08]: But at least to have someone that they could go to lunch with, introduce them to other people that maybe speak the language that they're here and in English.

1384
01:54:35,032 --> 01:54:37,113
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't, you know, I've never even asked that question.

1385
01:54:37,133 --> 01:54:37,734
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know why.

1386
01:54:38,321 --> 01:54:52,846
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, when the students come here who don't speak English, they're set up with special, with their classes that are with an ESL teacher or a duly certified teacher who is certified in the content as well as ESL.

1387
01:54:53,146 --> 01:54:55,987
[SPEAKER_12]: And those are our newcomer classrooms even here at the high school.

1388
01:54:57,087 --> 01:55:11,936
[SPEAKER_12]: The teachers in collaboration with the building, with the assistant principals and guidance kind of have an informal protocol to set up students with other students, but it's not formalized, it's not a specific program.

1389
01:55:12,356 --> 01:55:18,059
[SPEAKER_12]: But the actual classes, the students are with all newcomers in these newcomer classrooms.

1390
01:55:18,459 --> 01:55:19,541
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I understood that.

1391
01:55:19,561 --> 01:55:26,591
[SPEAKER_08]: I just didn't know if there was someone that they could hook them up with and, you know, at least show them, you know, to go to lunch with and maybe introduce it to their friends.

1392
01:55:26,732 --> 01:55:33,021
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, that way, at least interpret for them, especially when they come into a new building.

1393
01:55:33,061 --> 01:55:33,241
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean.

1394
01:55:33,782 --> 01:55:38,104
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you speak the language and you walk into a building or a new atmosphere and it's intimidating.

1395
01:55:38,705 --> 01:55:42,066
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, to come in and not know the language is even worse.

1396
01:55:42,466 --> 01:55:49,090
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was just thinking, like I said, years ago, my teachers just asked if we would take students along with us, at least at the beginning.

1397
01:55:49,570 --> 01:55:55,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it is very difficult to mandate someone to say, OK, you're going to be with that student every day.

1398
01:55:55,613 --> 01:56:05,381
[SPEAKER_08]: but at least to merge them into lunch, and where are the bathrooms, and where is the cafeteria, and how do you go talk to the principal, and how do I get back into that classroom that I was supposed to go into?

1399
01:56:05,721 --> 01:56:07,522
[SPEAKER_12]: And like I said, that's done informally.

1400
01:56:07,542 --> 01:56:14,387
[SPEAKER_12]: There's not a formal protocol or process for that, but the teachers work in collaboration with the guidance department on that.

1401
01:56:15,568 --> 01:56:16,169
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

1402
01:56:16,249 --> 01:56:16,389
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

1403
01:56:16,429 --> 01:56:16,869
[SPEAKER_19]: Vandekloot.

1404
01:56:17,610 --> 01:56:24,075
[SPEAKER_19]: So Mr. Texer, are you thinking that we would pilot a program in Portuguese for next school year?

1405
01:56:25,098 --> 01:56:27,119
[SPEAKER_12]: I would wait until guidance comes out.

1406
01:56:27,139 --> 01:56:38,722
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm actually going to a state meeting this Friday that will give me some additional information, and maybe I'll have a timeline on when the state will come out with their guidance.

1407
01:56:39,363 --> 01:56:43,304
[SPEAKER_12]: But I wouldn't move forward with anything until the guidance came forth.

1408
01:56:43,664 --> 01:56:57,172
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay so and at Medford high school say for the Portuguese students level one and level two would be those students who were certainly level one would be the students who were just coming to us and level two they might have been with us for?

1409
01:56:57,752 --> 01:57:03,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Well those levels are based on what we do as a screener test when the students arrive it's based on

1410
01:57:05,393 --> 01:57:11,356
[SPEAKER_12]: WIDA testing, we're using the WIDA screener, and that gives us the level.

1411
01:57:11,756 --> 01:57:20,000
[SPEAKER_12]: So students may have had English in their native country, which is why they would test as a level two, but they're still a newcomer, just arrival.

1412
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:24,982
[SPEAKER_12]: Other students that are level one most likely didn't have English in their native country.

1413
01:57:26,227 --> 01:57:39,171
[SPEAKER_19]: The other question, which certainly is to be addressed to you, but a little bit different, is that we changed significantly this year when we split some programs between the Roberts and the Brooks.

1414
01:57:39,811 --> 01:57:40,711
[SPEAKER_19]: How is that working out?

1415
01:57:44,354 --> 01:57:48,177
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd have to, I mean, are you looking for something specific or?

1416
01:57:48,397 --> 01:57:57,384
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I was just curious, I think one of the concerns had to do with siblings and the ability of siblings to oversee their, you know, sisters and brothers.

1417
01:57:58,025 --> 01:58:07,972
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that the Parent Information Center has been struggling with trying to do the placement that best meets both children, and in some cases that hasn't actually happened.

1418
01:58:08,533 --> 01:58:13,236
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so at some point I'd like to ask for a report on how that's worked out.

1419
01:58:14,442 --> 01:58:17,323
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be tied into our discussion about options.

1420
01:58:17,603 --> 01:58:18,864
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, sounds great.

1421
01:58:18,904 --> 01:58:25,987
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a larger picture and, you know, Paul and I have had some serious discussions about pros and cons of any kind of movement of people.

1422
01:58:26,487 --> 01:58:33,170
[SPEAKER_18]: What it means for staff, what it means for transportation, what it means for siblings, what it means for, you know, language groupings.

1423
01:58:33,910 --> 01:58:38,512
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a very complex issue and it requires a great deal of trade-off.

1424
01:58:39,232 --> 01:58:47,855
[SPEAKER_18]: We have to decide what's the most important thing to us, what are the most important issues to us, and how we're going to solve them because there's no one perfect solution for any of this.

1425
01:58:48,756 --> 01:58:49,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1426
01:58:49,636 --> 01:58:49,816
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1427
01:58:49,936 --> 01:58:53,438
[SPEAKER_13]: Stone, thank you for your report, both of you for your report.

1428
01:58:53,718 --> 01:59:04,082
[SPEAKER_13]: The last paragraph on the report is if we were to move either program to the Andrews, there are at least 10 teachers who will need the SEI endorsement.

1429
01:59:05,042 --> 01:59:10,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Organizations such as MatSol, Revis, Steam, I don't know any of them, will do training in the district.

1430
01:59:10,505 --> 01:59:16,147
[SPEAKER_13]: The cost is between $8,800 and $12,000 for anywhere from 25 to 30 participants.

1431
01:59:16,507 --> 01:59:19,349
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's new to me, I didn't know that there was a separate training.

1432
01:59:19,449 --> 01:59:21,109
[SPEAKER_13]: And is it, how long is the training?

1433
01:59:22,230 --> 01:59:23,630
[SPEAKER_12]: It's intense, it's a 40 hour course.

1434
01:59:25,489 --> 01:59:32,235
[SPEAKER_13]: And so these companies, they'll all come to our city and would train the teachers who need this certification?

1435
01:59:32,455 --> 01:59:32,675
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1436
01:59:33,396 --> 01:59:39,021
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's only certain providers can give it because this was governed under the Department of Justice.

1437
01:59:40,422 --> 01:59:46,548
[SPEAKER_12]: So like Medford can't just offer their own training and say, okay, you're retail endorsed.

1438
01:59:46,668 --> 01:59:51,972
[SPEAKER_12]: It has to be through one of the state providers because the Department of Justice is still overseeing it.

1439
01:59:52,773 --> 01:59:53,174
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1440
01:59:53,514 --> 01:59:59,922
[SPEAKER_18]: At one time it should be noted that the courses were offered free, but that gate is now closed.

1441
01:59:59,942 --> 02:00:00,502
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1442
02:00:00,542 --> 02:00:08,552
[SPEAKER_18]: So now we have to, if we have openings for new people, if they're not coming out of colleges with the SEI enforcement, we have to actually offer it if they have students.

1443
02:00:08,993 --> 02:00:09,814
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, thank you.

1444
02:00:11,905 --> 02:00:13,607
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to receive in place?

1445
02:00:13,707 --> 02:00:15,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a paper in place on file, ma'am?

1446
02:00:15,388 --> 02:00:18,590
[SPEAKER_15]: By Mr. Skerry, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1447
02:00:18,610 --> 02:00:19,771
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1448
02:00:20,371 --> 02:00:20,571
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1449
02:00:20,631 --> 02:00:21,312
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1450
02:00:21,392 --> 02:00:22,032
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1451
02:00:22,052 --> 02:00:23,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Texerra.

1452
02:00:24,892 --> 02:00:28,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Item 5, recommendation to approve revised field trip policy.

1453
02:00:28,754 --> 02:00:29,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Superintendent.

1454
02:00:29,754 --> 02:00:36,738
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to ask our deputy superintendent to tell us how we've responded to some of the issues that were raised recently.

1455
02:00:45,082 --> 02:00:45,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

1456
02:00:46,883 --> 02:00:57,848
[SPEAKER_07]: So at the Committee of the Whole meeting on November 13th, Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson gave an overview of the draft of the field trip policy.

1457
02:00:59,549 --> 02:01:13,036
[SPEAKER_07]: It is important to know, I want to give credit where credit is due, that the substantive part of this policy really was developed by Tony Vento, Director of Health Services, and Gail Trainor, Assistant Principal at the high school.

1458
02:01:14,356 --> 02:01:26,342
[SPEAKER_07]: So Beverly, Tony, Gail, and I reviewed this in light of the comments that the committee had on the 13th, and we made the following revisions.

1459
02:01:26,923 --> 02:01:29,964
[SPEAKER_07]: There are five revisions that I will go over.

1460
02:01:30,485 --> 02:01:35,267
[SPEAKER_07]: The first revision is that we added an accessibility statement.

1461
02:01:35,867 --> 02:01:40,450
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you look on page one of the document, the bottom of page one,

1462
02:01:41,450 --> 02:01:43,791
[SPEAKER_07]: In bold print, we added the following.

1463
02:01:44,271 --> 02:01:50,534
[SPEAKER_07]: The Medford Public Schools is committed to ensuring that district field trips are accessible to all students.

1464
02:01:51,215 --> 02:02:01,820
[SPEAKER_07]: The policy adheres to all requirements set forth in both Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, also known as ADA of 1990.

1465
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:05,962
[SPEAKER_07]: So we addressed that concern with that statement.

1466
02:02:08,043 --> 02:02:10,364
[SPEAKER_07]: The second concern that we addressed

1467
02:02:12,331 --> 02:02:25,527
[SPEAKER_07]: is has to do with the definition of a chaperone, and a chaperone includes any adult who is vested or non-vested with monitoring student safety so if you look on page two of your document

1468
02:02:28,404 --> 02:02:32,165
[SPEAKER_07]: The second half of the page, next to where it says chaperones, I will read that.

1469
02:02:32,766 --> 02:02:34,426
[SPEAKER_07]: So the wording now is the following.

1470
02:02:34,987 --> 02:02:48,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Chaperone is any employee of the Metro Public Schools or parent slash guardian or any adult that attends a trip and is vested or non-vested with the responsibility of monitoring student safety.

1471
02:02:49,724 --> 02:02:58,556
[SPEAKER_07]: does not say a criminal offender record information or a quarry check of all chaperones must be on file in the superintendent's office at least seven days prior to the date of the trip.

1472
02:02:58,576 --> 02:03:01,861
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so that addresses that second concern.

1473
02:03:04,078 --> 02:03:14,048
[SPEAKER_07]: The third concern has to do with in emergency situations, the school committee will be added to the list of entities that will be notified.

1474
02:03:14,449 --> 02:03:24,579
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you look on page three of the document, under letter J, Roman numeral three, lowercase Roman numeral three,

1475
02:03:25,648 --> 02:03:28,209
[SPEAKER_07]: you will see that members of the school committee have added.

1476
02:03:28,569 --> 02:03:48,575
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll read all of J. Should an emergency situation occur, the sponsoring faculty member is responsible for notifying, to the best of their ability, by telephone, text, or email, as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after the emergency situation occurs, the following individuals.

1477
02:03:49,175 --> 02:03:51,896
[SPEAKER_07]: The superintendent, headmaster, and principal.

1478
02:03:52,864 --> 02:03:58,328
[SPEAKER_07]: the parent slash guardian of record, and again, number three, members of the school committee.

1479
02:03:59,869 --> 02:04:03,031
[SPEAKER_07]: So we believe that addresses that third concern.

1480
02:04:04,472 --> 02:04:06,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Going on to the fourth concern.

1481
02:04:07,674 --> 02:04:10,616
[SPEAKER_07]: So the fourth concern has to do with the term counseling services.

1482
02:04:10,996 --> 02:04:13,478
[SPEAKER_07]: We've broadened that to support services.

1483
02:04:13,898 --> 02:04:15,739
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you look in the document on page five,

1484
02:04:18,281 --> 02:04:21,882
[SPEAKER_07]: On page five you have, let's see, it's section four approval documentation.

1485
02:04:22,002 --> 02:04:35,648
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go down to letter D, again on page five, letter D, it says the cost per student, if applicable, including the provision for nursing or support services.

1486
02:04:35,668 --> 02:04:40,849
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, we change counseling to support services if necessary, as well as travel insurance.

1487
02:04:41,950 --> 02:04:44,631
[SPEAKER_07]: So we believe that addresses that concern.

1488
02:04:45,534 --> 02:05:00,905
[SPEAKER_07]: And then lastly, the fifth concern that was expressed on the night of the 13th has to do with affirming, creating an affirmation statement that all field trip related forms will be posted to the school's website.

1489
02:05:01,225 --> 02:05:12,613
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you look on page nine of the document, it's the very last item, it's a letter D, and it now says all field trip related forms will be posted to the district website.

1490
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:32,389
[SPEAKER_19]: uh... i'm happy to take any any questions uh... thank you bernadette so of the uh... corrections and changes that you've made i've noted that all the ones that i particularly had brought up the taking care of that of course now being said is my eyes lit on another uh...

1491
02:05:34,369 --> 02:05:36,970
[SPEAKER_19]: which I think we need to amend.

1492
02:05:37,271 --> 02:05:38,971
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you give me a second so I can find it.

1493
02:05:40,472 --> 02:05:46,354
[SPEAKER_19]: It has to do with the notification for approval or disapproval of the field trip.

1494
02:05:46,474 --> 02:06:01,780
[SPEAKER_19]: And it is on page four, section three B. It reads right now, all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote by the Medford School Committee six months prior to the trip.

1495
02:06:03,064 --> 02:06:05,585
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have to say, I know that that's totally unrealistic.

1496
02:06:06,105 --> 02:06:13,969
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that when we're thinking about it, we're thinking about all-schools concert trips, which involve overnight out-of-country travel.

1497
02:06:14,389 --> 02:06:24,354
[SPEAKER_19]: So that would be when the kids are going off to Spain or Italy or whatever, that that time frame of six months is what we would be expecting or looking for.

1498
02:06:25,417 --> 02:06:35,080
[SPEAKER_19]: But we all know that there have been other overnight trips, even including, you know, the SkillsUSA program is an overnight trip.

1499
02:06:35,740 --> 02:06:38,701
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had kids go to the Ethics Bowl was an overnight trip.

1500
02:06:39,161 --> 02:06:41,602
[SPEAKER_19]: Those things, there was no time to give six months.

1501
02:06:42,022 --> 02:06:46,444
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not realistic to have our policy say six months.

1502
02:06:46,464 --> 02:06:48,084
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think we need a sentence which say,

1503
02:06:50,665 --> 02:07:02,668
[SPEAKER_19]: For other field trips, you know, for other overnight trips, the school committee will be brought to the school committee for their approval.

1504
02:07:04,148 --> 02:07:04,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Using discretion.

1505
02:07:05,649 --> 02:07:08,429
[SPEAKER_19]: Using as timely, you know, I mean, it depends on the timeframe.

1506
02:07:08,449 --> 02:07:09,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Prior to the trip.

1507
02:07:09,569 --> 02:07:11,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Prior discretion to the trip.

1508
02:07:11,630 --> 02:07:13,130
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, prior to the trip.

1509
02:07:13,170 --> 02:07:14,711
[SPEAKER_19]: But I mean, it has to be reasonable.

1510
02:07:14,731 --> 02:07:19,992
[SPEAKER_19]: We really don't like the last minute ones that, I mean, there's a last minute one because there's an opportunity that's last minute.

1511
02:07:20,692 --> 02:07:23,393
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's a last minute one because nobody got around to telling us.

1512
02:07:41,144 --> 02:07:54,219
[SPEAKER_08]: The only question I have about that is that sometimes depending on our schedule if something comes up quickly and a deposit has to be put in to hold it and we don't meet

1513
02:07:55,671 --> 02:07:57,372
[SPEAKER_08]: until after the deadline.

1514
02:07:57,392 --> 02:08:03,655
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, there is a clause which allows the superintendent to approve a trip if we don't have a meeting.

1515
02:08:03,835 --> 02:08:04,255
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1516
02:08:04,296 --> 02:08:05,736
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's covered in that.

1517
02:08:05,776 --> 02:08:10,239
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, I think the first sentence needs to say overnight out of country.

1518
02:08:10,879 --> 02:08:11,859
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1519
02:08:12,260 --> 02:08:12,620
[SPEAKER_19]: Travel.

1520
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:18,263
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the second sentence need to say other, I'm just trying to think.

1521
02:08:19,083 --> 02:08:30,536
[SPEAKER_19]: Other trips involving overnight travel must be approved by the school committee within an appropriate time frame.

1522
02:08:30,757 --> 02:08:33,460
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we're gonna need to leave it a little bit unclear.

1523
02:08:35,782 --> 02:08:38,005
[SPEAKER_19]: Unless someone else has a better wording.

1524
02:08:38,405 --> 02:08:54,414
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I had a, because the wording is already in here, it seems like, under E. I wouldn't distinguish between out of country or in, just private payment means, before they book it, they have to get approval from us.

1525
02:08:56,215 --> 02:09:04,539
[SPEAKER_15]: And then if there's an extreme emergency, or it comes up really short notice, like the bulls came up very short notice, then that's different.

1526
02:09:05,060 --> 02:09:06,460
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's addressed like at an E.

1527
02:09:09,698 --> 02:09:12,020
[SPEAKER_07]: So prior to payment.

1528
02:09:12,060 --> 02:09:27,053
[SPEAKER_19]: So you're saying all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote of the Medford School Committee prior to payment.

1529
02:09:27,154 --> 02:09:28,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Prior to payment, okay.

1530
02:09:30,218 --> 02:09:31,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I will add that, change that.

1531
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:35,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there any other suggestions at this point?

1532
02:09:35,781 --> 02:09:38,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope, that's good.

1533
02:09:38,822 --> 02:09:39,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve.

1534
02:09:39,523 --> 02:09:40,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Benedetto.

1535
02:09:40,303 --> 02:09:41,263
[SPEAKER_10]: I just had one note too.

1536
02:09:42,004 --> 02:09:43,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Benedetto.

1537
02:09:43,484 --> 02:09:47,146
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, thank you for making all the changes I brought forward at that meeting.

1538
02:09:50,203 --> 02:10:00,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just hoping that that statement about the method of public schools is committed to ensuring that the district field trips are accessible to all students.

1539
02:10:00,729 --> 02:10:13,036
[SPEAKER_03]: The policy adheres to all requirements set forth by both section 504, Rehabilitation Act and American Disability Act meets the needs that were brought up by other people at that meeting.

1540
02:10:14,316 --> 02:10:15,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it does.

1541
02:10:15,217 --> 02:10:17,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's fair and appropriate.

1542
02:10:17,738 --> 02:10:20,301
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I will say is that I did do research.

1543
02:10:20,501 --> 02:10:25,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I looked at a lot of other district policy statements.

1544
02:10:25,506 --> 02:10:34,795
[SPEAKER_07]: I looked at a lot of federal law, and I thought this encompassed it in a broad way, in a succinct way.

1545
02:10:35,275 --> 02:10:37,837
[SPEAKER_07]: There are volumes and volumes of information.

1546
02:10:37,857 --> 02:10:39,478
[SPEAKER_07]: There's obviously lots of case law.

1547
02:10:40,098 --> 02:10:41,159
[SPEAKER_07]: I try to be succinct.

1548
02:10:41,819 --> 02:10:48,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm certainly willing to be open, but I did research on it.

1549
02:10:54,226 --> 02:11:00,028
[SPEAKER_03]: does meet that need, and thank you for adding that in, as well as making the changes I brought forward.

1550
02:11:00,689 --> 02:11:09,492
[SPEAKER_03]: The only other thing I have is I was hoping to see an example of the form that teachers and staff would meet, and I wanted to, you know,

1551
02:11:10,352 --> 02:11:22,338
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure that it's on the online, so it goes from one person, gets signed off by the nurses, then goes to the administration, and then finally signed off by the superintendent in electronic format.

1552
02:11:22,598 --> 02:11:25,500
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would like to see and approve that form.

1553
02:11:25,900 --> 02:11:34,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And also an example of the medication administration slash delegation form that the district uses, I'd like to see that as well.

1554
02:11:34,424 --> 02:11:36,085
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's here all in one shot.

1555
02:11:36,525 --> 02:11:43,468
[SPEAKER_03]: So if parents ever want to see what's the policy, they have the sample forms, they have everything right here, part of this packet.

1556
02:11:44,009 --> 02:11:53,173
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm asking that this be revised and brought to us with those in tact, because that was what was requested at our last meeting for my notes.

1557
02:11:53,693 --> 02:11:56,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I ask a question?

1558
02:11:56,594 --> 02:11:57,694
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do have forms.

1559
02:11:58,755 --> 02:12:00,475
[SPEAKER_07]: There's probably 12, maybe.

1560
02:12:00,495 --> 02:12:01,835
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there are about 12 forms.

1561
02:12:02,236 --> 02:12:04,196
[SPEAKER_07]: They are still in development.

1562
02:12:04,316 --> 02:12:07,717
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that, again, Tony Vento and Gail Traynor have been working on them.

1563
02:12:08,037 --> 02:12:09,938
[SPEAKER_07]: They're very close to being finalized.

1564
02:12:10,218 --> 02:12:11,638
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not just one or two.

1565
02:12:11,938 --> 02:12:20,241
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of forms, and we're trying to make them so that they're visually easy to understand, yet substantive at the same time.

1566
02:12:20,647 --> 02:12:23,670
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm asking to table this until we have the completed.

1567
02:12:23,710 --> 02:12:25,352
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we've asked for an amendment as well.

1568
02:12:25,492 --> 02:12:26,853
[SPEAKER_15]: So when you bring back the amendment.

1569
02:12:28,215 --> 02:12:28,955
[SPEAKER_19]: May I ask one question?

1570
02:12:28,975 --> 02:12:29,996
[SPEAKER_19]: You have the samples ready?

1571
02:12:30,397 --> 02:12:35,682
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there any concern about tabling this piece of it at this point?

1572
02:12:35,722 --> 02:12:37,824
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it gonna hold anything up in terms of?

1573
02:12:38,905 --> 02:12:39,646
[SPEAKER_19]: We have an amendment.

1574
02:12:39,666 --> 02:12:39,866
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1575
02:12:41,738 --> 02:12:42,999
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think it's gonna hold anything up.

1576
02:12:43,039 --> 02:12:45,561
[SPEAKER_18]: You know the basic premise of the report.

1577
02:12:45,581 --> 02:12:46,241
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, okay.

1578
02:12:46,261 --> 02:12:51,225
[SPEAKER_18]: I think if we allow us to just move forward, you know, and the formalization will take place when we get back.

1579
02:12:51,245 --> 02:12:55,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so you want a motion to approve subject to the amendment that we just drafted?

1580
02:12:56,568 --> 02:12:58,870
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, Erin, yes.

1581
02:12:59,670 --> 02:13:07,896
[SPEAKER_19]: No, Erin wants to, what I was just asking was for clarification, because Erin wants to table it at right now and hold it until we have all of it together.

1582
02:13:08,236 --> 02:13:10,317
[SPEAKER_19]: I just asked whether there was any problem with that.

1583
02:13:10,618 --> 02:13:20,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I guess, you know, we're gonna have some field trips that are gonna show up in the next little while, and if it takes a little bit longer to get everything clear, we'll be operating under some old rules.

1584
02:13:20,504 --> 02:13:25,208
[SPEAKER_18]: It might be useful to just simply say that in the main, this is an acceptable piece, understanding the amendment.

1585
02:13:26,188 --> 02:13:30,292
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, and that we provide the forms at the earliest possible time in January.

1586
02:13:32,495 --> 02:13:42,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, I would second the field trip policy we accepted tonight with inclusion of amendments to the latest date.

1587
02:13:43,085 --> 02:13:43,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Forms.

1588
02:13:43,666 --> 02:13:44,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Your forms, yes.

1589
02:13:45,632 --> 02:13:48,255
[SPEAKER_18]: and we'll provide them to you, but at least you'll have something that's, you know.

1590
02:13:48,275 --> 02:13:50,958
[SPEAKER_03]: At least we have a policy in place.

1591
02:13:50,998 --> 02:14:00,269
[SPEAKER_03]: The forms need to be approved, I want them district wide, there's specific things, so it's hard to approve something based on, without having everything at one point.

1592
02:14:01,030 --> 02:14:04,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like, everything is in here that we need in here, but I,

1593
02:14:07,661 --> 02:14:11,202
[SPEAKER_03]: How long would it take to get the forms to us and be presented?

1594
02:14:11,322 --> 02:14:12,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we have a lot of meetings coming up.

1595
02:14:13,263 --> 02:14:17,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they have to be K-12 forms.

1596
02:14:18,484 --> 02:14:19,925
[SPEAKER_07]: They are created.

1597
02:14:19,945 --> 02:14:22,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they might need a little bit more tweaking.

1598
02:14:22,306 --> 02:14:23,606
[SPEAKER_07]: We have been working on that.

1599
02:14:23,706 --> 02:14:26,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps Beverly has something to add to that.

1600
02:14:27,384 --> 02:14:29,887
[SPEAKER_22]: The forms were done, they just aren't organized.

1601
02:14:29,927 --> 02:14:35,572
[SPEAKER_22]: When we got the forms, they were so voluminous that they were just very hard for people to deal with.

1602
02:14:35,973 --> 02:14:37,874
[SPEAKER_22]: So I know, Tony, we've been working at it.

1603
02:14:37,914 --> 02:14:40,877
[SPEAKER_22]: We just, it will take more time to get it.

1604
02:14:40,917 --> 02:14:43,320
[SPEAKER_22]: The forms should not change anything in the policy.

1605
02:14:44,441 --> 02:14:51,228
[SPEAKER_22]: And, again, I'm a little concerned about dragging this out because people are looking for guidance, the administration, the principals.

1606
02:14:51,268 --> 02:14:53,050
[SPEAKER_22]: We have a meeting tomorrow with principals.

1607
02:14:53,070 --> 02:14:57,674
[SPEAKER_22]: We'd like to be able to say we have a policy guide so that we don't keep going on.

1608
02:14:58,335 --> 02:15:01,118
[SPEAKER_22]: The forms, again, it's an organizational piece.

1609
02:15:01,418 --> 02:15:05,983
[SPEAKER_22]: It's trying to make them customer-friendly, and it should not really

1610
02:15:06,651 --> 02:15:07,694
[SPEAKER_22]: be anything.

1611
02:15:07,734 --> 02:15:11,282
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we have those forms by the 18th to satisfy the needs of this board?

1612
02:15:18,002 --> 02:15:18,642
[SPEAKER_22]: I think so.

1613
02:15:18,702 --> 02:15:20,803
[SPEAKER_22]: Tony, you said we've been revising.

1614
02:15:20,823 --> 02:15:21,623
[SPEAKER_22]: We've been working on it.

1615
02:15:22,023 --> 02:15:25,664
[SPEAKER_22]: We just don't have it perfect, OK?

1616
02:15:26,044 --> 02:15:27,664
[SPEAKER_22]: In terms of there are medical forms.

1617
02:15:27,684 --> 02:15:31,165
[SPEAKER_22]: OK, it's kind of a cascading effect.

1618
02:15:31,545 --> 02:15:34,045
[SPEAKER_22]: There's the preliminary forms that everybody's going to have to do.

1619
02:15:34,566 --> 02:15:39,467
[SPEAKER_22]: And then what comes into play is another set of forms for children that have medical issues.

1620
02:15:40,207 --> 02:15:45,208
[SPEAKER_22]: So we need to make it so that people understand they don't have to fill out 20 forms when

1621
02:15:45,848 --> 02:15:46,528
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't apply.

1622
02:15:46,548 --> 02:15:54,151
[SPEAKER_22]: And so that's what we're struggling with now, trying to make this concise, make it applicable to the particular trip.

1623
02:15:54,831 --> 02:16:00,453
[SPEAKER_22]: And we don't want, because we know what happens when you put a whole bunch of papers out, people just look at it and say, I can't do this.

1624
02:16:00,533 --> 02:16:01,393
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, it's just too much.

1625
02:16:01,753 --> 02:16:03,734
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're trying to make it customer friendly.

1626
02:16:04,294 --> 02:16:12,677
[SPEAKER_22]: But again, the policy, the form should really not, I mean, we can get them to you, but I'd like to move forward with this if we could.

1627
02:16:16,392 --> 02:16:34,007
[SPEAKER_03]: So the form I'm looking at is is the application to go on the field trip Not so much all the forms that all parents have to do but even the application form like okay I want to take my second grade class to Apple picking at you know

1628
02:16:35,231 --> 02:16:47,941
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm going to go online, I'm going to fill this out, it's going to go to the nurse and it's going to go to my head, you know, my principal and the superintendent for approval.

1629
02:16:48,975 --> 02:16:50,237
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the type of form I want.

1630
02:16:50,257 --> 02:16:50,957
[SPEAKER_03]: From the teacher.

1631
02:16:51,218 --> 02:16:51,959
[SPEAKER_03]: From everyone.

1632
02:16:52,019 --> 02:16:57,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want it tracked, so I want to know, I want data next year saying, this is where they went.

1633
02:16:58,086 --> 02:17:03,872
[SPEAKER_03]: This grade over here went on five field trips, whereas this school over here hasn't.

1634
02:17:03,992 --> 02:17:07,056
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe as a district, we might want to help them.

1635
02:17:07,977 --> 02:17:09,499
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I want that data.

1636
02:17:09,619 --> 02:17:18,711
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the form that I, I don't need every single form at this point, but I want, when you roll this out, hey, here's our new thing, and this is how you apply.

1637
02:17:19,251 --> 02:17:20,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it to go with it.

1638
02:17:20,893 --> 02:17:21,995
[SPEAKER_03]: If you just do that one.

1639
02:17:23,456 --> 02:17:28,860
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think, too, Erin, you may have mentioned last time at the meeting a checklist of things.

1640
02:17:29,661 --> 02:17:31,282
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we added one thing to the checklist.

1641
02:17:31,462 --> 02:17:32,623
[SPEAKER_22]: So we have the checklist.

1642
02:17:33,184 --> 02:17:35,045
[SPEAKER_22]: We have the preliminary form.

1643
02:17:35,145 --> 02:17:47,414
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just that we really want to make everything else, and it can be a lot of forms, depending upon the youngsters who are going on the trip, something that people aren't going to look at and say, I'm not going to go on the trip because I don't want to fill out the forms.

1644
02:17:47,854 --> 02:17:49,396
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be the last thing we want to do on that.

1645
02:17:50,711 --> 02:17:56,629
[SPEAKER_22]: We can do the checklist and we can do just the preliminary application.

1646
02:17:57,197 --> 02:17:58,598
[SPEAKER_08]: A clarification on that.

1647
02:17:58,618 --> 02:17:59,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion.

1648
02:17:59,058 --> 02:18:02,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information.

1649
02:18:03,682 --> 02:18:10,167
[SPEAKER_08]: There is, I mean, I know that there's a large group that have computers, but there's also a large group out there that doesn't.

1650
02:18:10,887 --> 02:18:19,173
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I just want to make sure, you know, not everything translates from on-site to actually hot copy as easily.

1651
02:18:20,274 --> 02:18:24,437
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we're doing this online, are we doing them in different languages?

1652
02:18:24,778 --> 02:18:26,179
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just for teachers.

1653
02:18:28,765 --> 02:18:30,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's where the clarification is.

1654
02:18:30,446 --> 02:18:36,067
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not talking about the parent filling it out, you're actually just talking about the teacher filling it out.

1655
02:18:36,187 --> 02:18:44,309
[SPEAKER_22]: There will be a parent permission form that will be part of the package, but I think at this point we're talking about what's the checklist.

1656
02:18:45,230 --> 02:18:53,512
[SPEAKER_22]: Most of this, a lot of this has stemmed from the fact that teachers would begin to plan trips, begin to fundraise,

1657
02:18:53,908 --> 02:18:57,152
[SPEAKER_22]: begin to get kids excited without the principal knowing.

1658
02:18:57,913 --> 02:19:00,276
[SPEAKER_22]: And then there were all kinds of repercussions after the fact.

1659
02:19:00,296 --> 02:19:07,305
[SPEAKER_22]: So this was really initially an attempt to make sure that before people start the process, they know what the process has to be.

1660
02:19:07,826 --> 02:19:10,249
[SPEAKER_22]: And so that was where this was originated from.

1661
02:19:14,153 --> 02:19:15,154
[SPEAKER_15]: It's two separate ones.

1662
02:19:15,214 --> 02:19:20,721
[SPEAKER_15]: One's a motion to accept the policy with the one amendment that was made a little earlier.

1663
02:19:21,262 --> 02:19:25,727
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Erin asked that the whole policy not be accepted until we have the forms.

1664
02:19:26,408 --> 02:19:29,172
[SPEAKER_15]: She's now specified it's the start form.

1665
02:19:29,772 --> 02:19:31,294
[SPEAKER_15]: But to me the policy

1666
02:19:32,295 --> 02:19:37,599
[SPEAKER_15]: dictates and the forms can come and they can be changed as things change in life.

1667
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:48,768
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would ask that we approve the policy so that we can get it out to the principals, especially at your meeting tomorrow, and then we can get the forms at our next meeting or the meeting after.

1668
02:19:48,808 --> 02:19:54,453
[SPEAKER_22]: We can get those two forms to you next time, but we won't have the opportunity to meet with the principals again until January.

1669
02:19:54,913 --> 02:19:56,935
[SPEAKER_22]: So if we had this to them tomorrow, it would be helpful.

1670
02:19:57,675 --> 02:19:57,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

1671
02:19:57,855 --> 02:19:58,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Kreatz.

1672
02:19:58,996 --> 02:20:02,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I had a similar question about the forms.

1673
02:20:02,298 --> 02:20:13,144
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to know, are the forms gonna be available to the teachers with the Google Doc documents, where they can go in and add their information directly onto it and then move it along?

1674
02:20:13,484 --> 02:20:15,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think that was discussed at the last meeting.

1675
02:20:16,185 --> 02:20:28,756
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it was At the committee of the whole about the field trip there was a number of parents from the CPAC organization Did you reach out to them to ask them if this was I don't they spoke about the language?

1676
02:20:28,797 --> 02:20:32,380
[SPEAKER_13]: They were looking for that made them feel confident that we were being equitable.

1677
02:20:32,940 --> 02:20:33,961
[SPEAKER_13]: So is that possible?

1678
02:20:33,981 --> 02:20:38,385
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the chairperson said could you reach out to me with language I could help you with language and

1679
02:20:38,961 --> 02:20:39,161
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

1680
02:20:39,222 --> 02:20:49,620
[SPEAKER_22]: We basically, as Bernadette said, she did the research, but we also worked with Kathy Medaglia, who looked at this for me and thought that this would be something that would cover all of those instances.

1681
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:51,483
[SPEAKER_22]: So we feel that it does.

1682
02:20:53,262 --> 02:20:54,362
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a motion on the floor, Ms.

1683
02:20:54,382 --> 02:20:54,843
[SPEAKER_19]: Vanden Heuvel.

1684
02:20:55,083 --> 02:21:00,644
[SPEAKER_19]: So you're gonna kill me, but I'm going back to this line about approval.

1685
02:21:01,425 --> 02:21:17,050
[SPEAKER_19]: And you just said something, you said that what happened in the past is that teachers started advertising to the kids that they were gonna go on this, and they got everybody all excited, and they might even start raising money, and that has nothing to do with payment.

1686
02:21:18,230 --> 02:21:31,881
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we're saying that when we want to approve the trip, if you're waiting, saying, well, we only need to approve it with payment, that means that teacher can already be advertising it and they can be raising money.

1687
02:21:32,061 --> 02:21:35,264
[SPEAKER_19]: Payment is not the word that you want there.

1688
02:21:35,504 --> 02:21:37,505
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're dealing with which, come on back.

1689
02:21:37,706 --> 02:21:41,208
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is page four, number three.

1690
02:21:41,248 --> 02:21:41,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just see.

1691
02:21:44,995 --> 02:21:47,517
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's, yes, right here.

1692
02:21:48,618 --> 02:21:55,003
[SPEAKER_22]: All school-sponsored trips involve overnight, out-of-state travel, must receive prior approval.

1693
02:21:55,684 --> 02:21:58,226
[SPEAKER_15]: They need to figure out if people are even interested in going.

1694
02:21:58,246 --> 02:22:01,729
[SPEAKER_15]: They have to poll their students.

1695
02:22:01,829 --> 02:22:04,711
[SPEAKER_15]: If no one wants to go, they're not going to come to us and ask for approval.

1696
02:22:07,554 --> 02:22:15,078
[SPEAKER_07]: So what you're saying is that it should not be prior to payment, that we need to take that out.

1697
02:22:15,378 --> 02:22:18,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Moments ago you suggested that we add that in prior to payment.

1698
02:22:18,860 --> 02:22:20,280
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't suggest payment, someone else did.

1699
02:22:20,320 --> 02:22:20,921
[SPEAKER_19]: I did.

1700
02:22:20,941 --> 02:22:30,085
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, and I suggested that what we were doing was saying that teacher was going out of the country, the school committee wanted six months notice.

1701
02:22:30,626 --> 02:22:32,327
[SPEAKER_19]: I think if there's an overnight trip,

1702
02:22:35,548 --> 02:22:40,791
[SPEAKER_19]: within the United States that we want two months notice, maybe three months notice.

1703
02:22:41,451 --> 02:22:57,540
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I'm saying, and then I'm putting in a clause and saying, if an opportunity arises for students that is, you know, underneath this timeframe, that approval can be given by the superintendent with notification to the school committee.

1704
02:22:58,832 --> 02:23:04,295
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, that's that's how I would line it out now, because payment, I think, is I think payment is arbitrary.

1705
02:23:04,436 --> 02:23:06,577
[SPEAKER_22]: And there are some trips that we're not going to require payment.

1706
02:23:06,657 --> 02:23:08,118
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of the out of right.

1707
02:23:08,218 --> 02:23:10,279
[SPEAKER_19]: So just recently, we had the Italian.

1708
02:23:11,140 --> 02:23:11,480
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

1709
02:23:11,620 --> 02:23:14,122
[SPEAKER_19]: Come to New York opportunities to go to New York.

1710
02:23:14,162 --> 02:23:14,402
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

1711
02:23:14,662 --> 02:23:15,743
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, that was being funded.

1712
02:23:15,803 --> 02:23:16,863
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, someone else.

1713
02:23:17,064 --> 02:23:17,604
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.

1714
02:23:17,744 --> 02:23:19,445
[SPEAKER_22]: So it may be in a timely way.

1715
02:23:19,625 --> 02:23:22,267
[SPEAKER_22]: Overnight trips, other overnight trips must be.

1716
02:23:23,307 --> 02:23:28,011
[SPEAKER_22]: approved in a timely way, because we do have things that happen very quickly, like that New York trip.

1717
02:23:28,652 --> 02:23:30,553
[SPEAKER_22]: Others we have several months doing.

1718
02:23:30,593 --> 02:23:34,156
[SPEAKER_22]: So if we just put it in a timely way and we leave it kind of discretionary.

1719
02:23:36,112 --> 02:23:42,256
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you need to be careful not to overregulate because what happens is the circumstances change, situations change.

1720
02:23:42,696 --> 02:23:53,043
[SPEAKER_18]: What you're really saying to us, be responsible, be reasonable, keep us informed, make things, you know, don't let people go run amok and go too far down the road before, you know, you know about it.

1721
02:23:53,063 --> 02:23:55,244
[SPEAKER_18]: Because that's really what we're basically saying to people.

1722
02:23:55,284 --> 02:24:00,888
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think, you know, we've got professionals on staff, they've got to understand that that means give us the information in a timely way.

1723
02:24:01,568 --> 02:24:07,390
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Superintendent, do I dare remind you that just last week we were approving a field trip.

1724
02:24:07,430 --> 02:24:10,392
[SPEAKER_19]: We had a new administrator.

1725
02:24:10,432 --> 02:24:13,213
[SPEAKER_18]: We also had a full month where we didn't hold a meeting.

1726
02:24:13,853 --> 02:24:17,315
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's really, you know, that was really a circumstantial thing, but that's eight.

1727
02:24:17,335 --> 02:24:29,340
[SPEAKER_19]: So let me just ask the committee, if we're talking about foreign trips out of country to Italy, to Honduras, wherever it is, how much time does the committee want to know in advance to approve that?

1728
02:24:29,360 --> 02:24:30,220
[SPEAKER_05]: 90 days.

1729
02:24:32,103 --> 02:24:33,704
[SPEAKER_19]: 90 days, here it said six months.

1730
02:24:34,745 --> 02:24:39,749
[SPEAKER_22]: We usually bring those to you pretty early, you know, almost like a year.

1731
02:24:39,789 --> 02:24:49,036
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't want to be in a situation where there might be an opportunity for our students to do something.

1732
02:24:49,596 --> 02:24:59,364
[SPEAKER_08]: And then because the teacher then looks down and looks at the policy and says, oh, geez, it wasn't within the two weeks or it wasn't within the three weeks or seven months.

1733
02:24:59,504 --> 02:25:00,725
[SPEAKER_08]: What if they don't even bring it?

1734
02:25:01,185 --> 02:25:05,511
[SPEAKER_22]: What if we kept it six months unless there are extenuating circumstances?

1735
02:25:05,531 --> 02:25:06,693
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine.

1736
02:25:06,913 --> 02:25:08,014
[SPEAKER_22]: That's fine.

1737
02:25:08,054 --> 02:25:08,976
[SPEAKER_22]: Discretionary.

1738
02:25:11,038 --> 02:25:13,882
[SPEAKER_21]: Six months unless there are extenuating circumstances.

1739
02:25:15,340 --> 02:25:17,060
[SPEAKER_21]: That leaves some flexibility.

1740
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:17,381
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1741
02:25:17,401 --> 02:25:24,823
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think you should do three months, because I think... Wait, the six months was for foreign travel, okay?

1742
02:25:25,043 --> 02:25:32,625
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're saying just a general blanket, and the kids are going to Cape Cod, we're not asking for six months time.

1743
02:25:33,365 --> 02:25:44,748
[SPEAKER_22]: No, the overnight in domestic trips, I thought we said would be in a timely way, because those are going to pop up quickly, or they may be longer.

1744
02:25:45,212 --> 02:25:46,533
[SPEAKER_22]: I think those would be in a timely way.

1745
02:25:46,894 --> 02:25:51,458
[SPEAKER_22]: The six months, I think, for the international, I think is reasonable.

1746
02:25:51,578 --> 02:25:55,001
[SPEAKER_22]: Most of those trips are planned a year in advance, for the most part.

1747
02:25:55,301 --> 02:25:56,502
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, that's good.

1748
02:25:56,743 --> 02:25:58,324
[SPEAKER_15]: So as amended now.

1749
02:25:58,404 --> 02:26:04,409
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion for approval of the policy as amended on the floor, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

1750
02:26:04,490 --> 02:26:05,510
