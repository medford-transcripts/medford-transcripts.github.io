elect. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=161.518s">Also</a>  present were the following, Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson, Assistant Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Director of Pupil Services Kathleen Madaglio, Director of Curriculum Bernadette <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=175.369s">Director</a>  of Finance and Administration, Kirsteen Patterson. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=178.451s">Director</a>  of Foreign Language, Rita DeCarlo. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=180.512s">Supervisor</a>  of Health Services, Tony Vento. <a

href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=187.376s">Principal,</a>  Paul DeLeva. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=189.197s">Principal,</a>  Jacob Edwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=190.458s">Assistant</a>  Principal, Nick Tucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=191.918s">Athletic</a>  Trainer, Tanya Cashman. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=194.1s">Tim</a>  Zitt. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=195.08s">Registrar,</a>  Curtis Tudin, and other community members, including Tammy Simonotis, Marie Petrides, Angela Moore, David Lu, Melanie McLaughlin, Tanya Sullivan, and Jameel Webb Davis. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=207.512s">Transcript</a>  recorder Miranda Wilson was also in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=211.896s">The</a>  meeting was called to discuss school brains, the field trip policy, follow up on student concussions, and report on the North Medford bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=221.71s">It</a>  was a very substantial meeting, went on for hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=225.336s">I</a>  just added that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=226.557s">Superintendent</a>  Dawson made the following remarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=229.998s">The</a>  evenings, and by the way, sorry, there was a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=234.48s">It</a>  should be Bernadette Riccadeli. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=237.441s">So</a>  we addressed the four different issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=240.823s">And</a>  the first item was the report of the North Medford bus capacity and ridership. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=245.104s">Director</a>  of Administration and Finance, Christine Patterson, gave this report and it's attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=251.306s">And</a>  principal, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=253.427s">Tucci</a>  verified the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=254.967s">There</a>  are two buses coming from North Medford in the morning, and in the afternoon, there are between 45 to 50 riders daily, which is within its capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=264.309s">At</a>  this time, there's no need to add another bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=266.79s">Administration</a>  will keep the committee informed as demand increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=270.751s">The</a>  next item was student concussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=273.972s">We</a>  talked about this at length. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=277.253s">As</a>  part of our discussions, parent Tammy Simonotis spoke of her son's experience at Beverly High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=283.098s">She</a>  asserted that her son was injured during a JV soccer game and that there was inadequate trainer medical coverage by the Beverly staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=290.764s">She</a>  believes that the Beverly schools did not have a certified trainer at the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=294.367s">Her</a>  son suffered a head injury, chipped teeth, and nosebleeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=297.35s">The</a>  concern focused upon safety at away games. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=303.523s">Members</a>  of our staff spoke with the athletic director at Beverly, but really haven't received any more news. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=312.61s">Mrs.</a>  Simone was pleased with how Medford handles injuries, but was very upset at the Beverly response. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=320.837s">Concern</a>  was particularly high because the game was allowed to go on after the injury took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=326.942s">The</a>  superintendent promised that he will be conferring with the MIAA regarding this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=332.366s">The</a>  next item under discussion was the field trip policy, and Administrators Paul DeLiva, Tony Vento, and Kathy Medaglio contributed comments during the discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=343.072s">CPAC</a>  Chairperson Melanie McLaughlin raised equity issues about the policy and commented that CPAC should have been consulted as the policy was formulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=352.658s">There</a>  was a discussion about the annual trip to New York by the Andrew School and the questions about deadlines. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=360.226s">And</a>  among the 90 students who attended, there were 19 students who either had an IEP or 504 plan, and this was 19% of the participants. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=374.9s">If</a>  we had added another bus, it would have cost approximately 7,500 and would not have made the trip doable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=381.205s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=381.385s">McLaughlin</a>  asserted that the trip excluded students with disabilities and that every trip should be planned to serve all interested students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=389.471s">The</a>  issue raised several points. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=391.274s">Can</a>  field trips be planned with application deadlines if those deadlines are applicable to all students? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=396.681s">Should</a>  field trips be limited if the economics cannot be balanced? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=400.186s">And</a>  should the cost of medical services be shared by all participants or subsidized by the school system? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=405.673s">After</a>  continued discussion, the policy was tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=407.795s">Administrators</a>  will bring forward a revised policy that addresses the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=411.718s">The</a>  final issue of the evening was school brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=414.38s">Headmaster</a>  Perella and Data Information Specialist Registrar Curtis Tudin gave us a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=421.126s">The</a>  headmaster reported that changes had been made to address the GPA concerns raised during the spring by Mr. David Lu. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=427.331s">Mr.</a>  Tudin provided a chart that showed the increase in usage by parents and teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=431.654s">More</a>  will be done going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=433.296s">This</a>  is a work in progress, but it is moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=436.059s">Mr.</a>  Liu was still skeptical about the accuracy of the reporting system. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=439.682s">He</a>  revisited his concerns from last spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=442.805s">Administrators</a>  asserted that the changes would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=445.268s">The</a>  school committee asked to be informed as the year progressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=448.351s">The</a>  meeting was adjourned at 10.05. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=450.153s">Respectfully</a>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=452.955s">Very</a>  good, thank you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=453.796s">Vandekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=455.438s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=455.618s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=456.098s">Yes,</a>  Superintendent Belson, I just wanted to follow up with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=460.002s">I</a>  was in touch with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=461.023s">Simonettis</a>  and I just wanted to know if something was filed with the MIAA regarding the incident, if you've had a chance to file that yet.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=470.876s">Okay,</a>  so I've had substantial contact with the Beverly Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=475.818s">They</a>  strongly dispute the account provided to us by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=480.179s">Simonides.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=481.679s">I've</a>  gone back and forth with Stephen Hershey, who is the superintendent there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=485.681s">He</a>  claims, and he gave me the name of the trainer, the certified trainer who was on the field at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=492.723s">He</a>  said that no trainer from Beverly did anything with the individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=500.495s">As</a>  a result, he feels that it may have been somebody else who just simply helped out on the sidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=505.28s">So</a>  I have a lot more to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=506.501s">I</a>  did contact the MIAA briefly and told them that we're in the process of continuing to investigate what actually took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=514.349s">But</a>  there is a distinct difference of opinion between what Beverly feels happened and what was reported to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=522.277s">So</a>  there's a little bit going on right now, and I'll have more reports soon as I get a better chance to talk to all the parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=527.765s">The</a>  feeling from Beverly was that somebody assisted the student, but not necessarily the trainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=534.952s">the</a>  play was allowed to go forward without any reason to stop the play. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=540.658s">So</a>  there's back and forth, but Beverly strongly refutes the idea that their trainer assisted our student, and also that the trainer was not licensed, and they gave me the name and showed me the licensure.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=554.938s">Did</a>  you communicate that information to the parent? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=558.061s">Not</a>  yet.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=558.682s">You</a>  know, this is still going back. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=560.483s">In</a>  fact, the latest communication was as late as today. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=563.386s">I'm</a>  Stephen Hershey. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=564.888s">So</a>  I've got a lot more work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=567.23s">I</a>  mean, obviously, there's a real difference of opinion in what took place.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=570.973s">So</a>  you got the name and the person is not certified? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=575.136s">They</a>  are.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=576.056s">I</a>  actually have it on my phone.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=578.258s">I</a>  can give it to you afterwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=581.98s">I</a>  guess that would raise the question to me is if our kids are playing and a student got hurt, why wasn't our student cared for by the trainer who was there?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=593.606s">According</a>  to the Beverly Public Schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=597.374s">Since</a>  the referee didn't stop the play, obviously he didn't consider it serious enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=601.678s">And</a>  that for some reason, the assistance was done on the sidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=608.803s">They</a>  suspect that somebody who maybe had a nursing background or something else like that may have helped on the sidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=614.748s">The</a>  question is, why did the youngster go back in the game too if he had a kick in the head? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=618.391s">There</a>  are a couple of questions that still have to be answered.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=620.472s">And</a>  if the student, I believe the parent, told us that the student was bleeding, so why would the, I mean, we already talked about why didn't the referee stop the game?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=630.317s">Yeah,</a>  well, according to them, they didn't believe the referee needed to stop the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=634.879s">And</a>  secondly, you know, and without casting any aspersions on anyone, as you know, Mississimini's was not at the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=641.342s">And</a>  so as a result, we have a situation where people who were at the game have very different reports as to what took place there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=648.142s">Yes,</a>  but certainly blood is blood and if well, that's that's you know, an assumption that was made as to when the bleeding took place and who did what and where and I need more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=657.189s">I</a>  mean, obviously, we have a back and forth going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=660.171s">And</a>  I asked Stephen Hershey, who's the again, superintendent of Beverly, because Mississippi nineties was contacting the Beverly School Committee, and others up in Beverly. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=670.358s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=671.755s">they</a>  are siding with the Beverly Public Schools right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=674.436s">So</a>  I need a lot more feeling as to what's really took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=678.178s">Point</a>  of information, Mayor?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=679.318s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=679.998s">Through</a>  you to the Superintendent, has the Game Officials Committee been contacted to find out who the referee was?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=686.041s">I</a>  asked for that information, I haven't got it back yet.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=689.702s">Also,</a>  have you spoke to the coach?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=692.182s">I</a>  didn't speak to the coach, but Mr. Maloney did. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=694.764s">And</a>  so I'm gonna get a follow-up on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=696.365s">But</a>  again, today's information, which I just got today, is a direct refutation of the story we got. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=705.172s">And</a>  so I really need to ask a lot of questions.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=707.654s">Right,</a>  but we do have the student who this happened to, and we could have a follow-up with the student.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=714.56s">Yeah,</a>  I just don't know when it happened, how it happened, and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=719.443s">I</a>  have two very different reports.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=722.875s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=723.075s">Cugno.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=725.318s">When</a>  you find out from Beverly, or when you continue discussions with Beverly, could you find out, were they filming the game to see, you know, what type of play happened out there, or was there anyone filming the game to see what type of...</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=740.295s">I</a>  doubt they were filming the JV game. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=742.978s">They</a>  may have filmed the varsity game, but I doubt they filmed the JV game.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=745.781s">Well,</a>  sometimes it depends on the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=747.903s">They</a>  might do it if the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=749.344s">It</a>  could be someone out there that just had their Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=751.387s">Not</a>  their Facebook, their cell phone and were filming too. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=755.17s">Just</a>  to see what type of play and if there is something out there that at least we could see. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=759.695s">okay</a>  let me let me if I can mayor let me let me read you the latest communication from Stephen Hershey</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=783.52s">because</a>  I'm gonna put it on my cell phone, and it'll give you an idea of the strength of his comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=789.463s">It</a>  wasn't like, I don't think anything happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=791.484s">It</a>  was very, very direct. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=794.526s">So</a>  let me read it to you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=796.427s">While</a>  you're getting that up, Mr. Tringali, our student representative, would like to ask a question.</p>

    <p>[Sebastian Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=803.13s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=803.511s">A</a>  lot of the danger behind concussions is the lack of education that goes with it, and especially on the part of the coaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=812.844s">and</a>  if the student does not know to take themselves out of the game they will put themselves at risk for a second damage to the brain which is far worse than the first, so possibly if we're thinking about our own education policy in the future and keeping our own kids safe I think this is a great example to show that we should push for Medford coaches to be <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=842.848s">aware</a>  of concussions in the game.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=862.066s">It's</a>  been six years since Michelle's been gone, so about six years ago, that everyone had to go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=867.209s">The</a>  ironic part is that actually I argued with the referee themselves, their organization, because there is a policy out there that everyone has to go through, and that is the coaches have to go through it, the administration has to go through it, the students have to go through it, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=883.678s">have</a>  to go through it, and at that point in time, and of course, athletic directors had to go through it, nurses. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=891.666s">The</a>  only ones at that point in time that didn't have to go through it were the referees, which I thought was completely ironic because they were the ones that called the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=900.094s">Fought</a>  long and hard enough, it finally came true, and the referees have also had to go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=906.981s">Just</a>  to give you a quick policy on that, when a student has a concussion, our athletic trainer actually, before the season begins, tests all our children, and there's a certain way of testing them through the concussion strategies that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=922.211s">If</a>  by any chance a child does get hurt on the field, then that child has to go back to that trainer, gets evaluated, has to go to a doctor, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=931.117s">will</a>  not be placed on that field again, not only with the clearance of a doctor, not only with the clearance of the nurses, but also with the clearance of the trainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=939.88s">And</a>  let me tell you, our trainer, she doesn't care which doctor clears you, you will not get on that field unless that trainer <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=947.563s">And,</a>  unfortunately, this was a situation that happened prior to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=953.204s">It</a>  happened on the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=954.204s">It</a>  happened away, you know, in experiences of, I'm going to say, on everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=959.625s">You</a>  know, I understand that the student, the player wanted to get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=962.846s">And,</a>  you know, it's like everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=964.586s">The</a>  player always wants to get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=966.226s">But</a>  we as adults have to take responsibility, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=968.927s">I'm</a>  not blaming the coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=970.087s">I'm</a>  not blaming our team. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=971.207s">I'm</a>  not blaming anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=972.487s">I'm</a>  just saying that there's certain things that we need to make decisions upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=976.848s">No,</a>  the superintendent is working with them.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=979.17s">So</a>  I don't want to draw any conclusions until I have more investigation, but let me read you what Stephen Hershey wrote me today, and then attach some additional information which I'm exploring with others. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=989.4s">Good</a>  afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=989.881s">I'm</a>  sending you copies of what I have in addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=991.662s">Your</a>  athletic director sent a letter to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=993.604s">I</a>  spoke with several Beverly parents I know usually attend the games. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=997.168s">While</a>  some of them remember the play, they do not report it as a significant injury. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1001.892s">They</a>  note that there was no stoppage of play, nor the issuance of a card. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1005.416s">Our</a>  trainer's name is Charla Berenas, and she has been with us for a long time without complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1010.881s">Beverly</a>  has taken this seriously from the start, but I have been unable to verify what has been reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1015.766s">Our</a>  coaches and trainer are expected to deal with potential concussions with great caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1019.93s">We</a>  perform ongoing training to ensure we are attending to the safety of all athletes under our own <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1024.835s">are</a>  players from other teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1026.516s">I</a>  would like to find out what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1027.717s">Please</a>  forward me any information you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1030.099s">So</a>  we have an ongoing investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1033.041s">I</a>  can't draw a conclusion without more discussion with people. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1037.884s">This</a>  came through today. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1039.485s">And</a>  we've got a little bit more to follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1041.286s">And</a>  I just don't want to draw conclusions until I'm comfortable that everyone has a chance to review the information back and forth.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1048.631s">We'll</a>  mark it for a report, follow-up report on our agenda.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1051.733s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1060.055s">Okay,</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1061.356s">And</a>  you can add me to the meeting.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1095.173s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1095.834s">That</a>  paper is tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1097.616s">Committee</a>  of the Whole minutes from November 27th, 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1103.308s">This</a>  was a meeting that we held last week in order to discuss the succession plan for our superintendent of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1111.573s">We</a>  had the Mass Association of School Committees present. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1115.275s">He</a>  presented quite a brochure to us on strategies that we should use in our deliberations. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1122.959s">Ultimately,</a>  the Medford School Committee voted on the following matters in Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1128.662s">that</a>  the MASC, Mass Associated School Committee, will provide a sample brochure to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1134.083s">The</a>  school committee will also explore other search consultants before making a selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1138.744s">The</a>  school committee voted to review internal candidates first. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1141.325s">That</a>  was a seven to zero vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1143.245s">And</a>  the school committee voted to meet again on December 11th, 2017 to continue its work. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1149.427s">We</a>  also had quite a bit of discussion around a search committee if we ultimately do go outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1154.748s">What</a>  was explained to us is if we do internal candidates, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1158.689s">It</a>  would be school committee interviewing in a public session. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1162.433s">If</a>  from there we go to a full search, a nationwide search, let's say, we would form a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1168.901s">And</a>  the complement of that committee would be set up of three teachers from the different levels of schooling. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1177.81s">one</a>  administrator, one student, school committee members, suggested was three, and also community members being parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1187.676s">And</a>  we also wanted to make sure that we included all subgroups such as special ed and ELL in those check boxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1195.101s">So</a>  we're working on an actual application. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1197.482s">For</a>  those out there, we're working on a formal application that people can fill out and submit back to us if they have an interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1203.586s">Also,</a>  I ask that our diversity director be a member of this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1207.367s">It</a>  was voted on in a seven to zero, so thank you all for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1211.448s">And</a>  we will be meeting next week to discuss this further on December 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1215.008s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, is that up here?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1217.129s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1217.529s">That</a>  is in the high school.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1218.769s">It</a>  will be in the conference room.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1243.421s">You've</a>  been handed a report tonight that was sent to us.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1247.184s">So</a>  on our desk is a report on the 2017 breakfast participation rates as well as some literature.</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1255.851s">Good</a>  evening everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1257.613s">So</a>  I was asked to present some information on the school breakfast program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1262.217s">So</a>  I am a registered dietitian and I am the nutritionist for the food services department. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1267.681s">for</a>  Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1269.583s">Just</a>  some general information, we offer breakfast at all of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1273.945s">Most</a>  of them, it's traditional style offered before school begins in the cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1280.409s">Three</a>  of them offer breakfast free of charge for any student interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1285.473s">One</a>  of those three has breakfast not in the cafeteria before school, but in the classroom after the bell, and it counts as learning time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1294.597s">So</a>  if you look at the sheet that has the breakfast participation rates, if you look at the last column, the percent ADP, so the percentage of average daily participation, it ranges from 0% to 86 almost percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1310.164s">So</a>  this really shows the drastic variance in participation rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1315.967s">So</a>  the Columbus, the McGlynn Elementary and Middle School all are offering universally free breakfasts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1323.31s">So</a>  if you take a look at just those three, using the October 2017 data, the McGlynn Elementary School had almost 29% participation, the middle school was almost 21, and the Columbus was at about 86. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1338.26s">So</a>  the Columbus is the school that offers breakfast in the classroom for everyone, so you can see the difference that that really makes in the participation rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1347.586s">And</a>  this is not something that is unique <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1350.147s">to</a>  our district, the EOS Foundation, which is a non-profit organization that really promotes school breakfast being offered after the bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1358.754s">They</a>  have seen this statewide that schools offering free breakfasts in a traditional setting before the bell experience participation rates far lower than those who offer it in the classroom.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1371.824s">Could</a>  you explain why the Columbus offers it after the bell versus the others before?</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1377.38s">So</a>  that's a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1378.381s">The</a>  McGlynn Middle School, this is its first year instituting the universal, so I don't know what the decision was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1385.546s">The</a>  elementary school, from what I'm told a few years ago, I think this was before I started working here, there was a rodent issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1392.752s">They</a>  originally started off doing a breakfast in the class model, and there was a rodent issue that was attributed to the breakfast program, so they stopped.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1401.113s">So,</a>  Mr. Superintendent, are the principals deciding whether it's before or after the bell?</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1405.757s">Pretty</a>  much, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1406.478s">Pretty</a>  much? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1407.118s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1408.259s">Can</a>  we ask them to all reevaluate?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1410.261s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1412.422s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1412.803s">Would</a>  that be a recommendation you'd make?</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1414.364s">Yeah,</a>  that was my, I just wanted to have you consider this information and questions of universal breakfast going forward.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1421.17s">It's</a>  probably another factor, too, in terms of busing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1423.772s">The</a>  more busing that takes place, the less likely they are to arrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1428.663s">take</a>  it before the actual school starts.</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1431.789s">Oh,</a>  right, yes, yeah, that has a big impact in participation as well, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1435.172s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1436.253s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1437.353s">Could</a>  you tell me what the percentage of the forms returned are for each building, do you know that?</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1442.357s">So</a>  the free and reduced eligibility?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1444.119s">Yeah,</a>  whether they sign that they need it or they return the form saying that they're not eligible but they have to sign their form. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1452.345s">Does</a>  every student sign have a form returned?</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1455.908s">No,</a>  it's voluntary.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1457.649s">And</a>  how do we get two parents that <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1462.423s">don't</a>  know what this is, and it's coming home, and they're not knowing to turn them back in, and get the quote we need, because that would, you know, that would change a lot, and do parents know that this also reflects in whether or not they pay for SAT exams, as well as college applications, if they reduce lunch, has bigger implications other than just foods on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1486.256s">And</a>  I don't think, like up at the high school you might not get any kids learning forms, but if they knew that that was tied in and there was like a campaign to really educate people throughout the community, I think that our numbers could actually be higher than what they're listed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1501.926s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1503.227s">So</a>  that's concerning to me and I think we have to have like almost 100% return rate per building and like really make it like a campaign or part of re-registration at each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1514.455s">So</a>  that way we are making sure we capture hungry families as well as giving all those alternative processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1523.542s">So</a>  I would really like to know how many forms were returned. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1527.846s">per</a>  school, like broken down by school, as well as a plan for outreach for next year, so that way we are reaching every family. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1536.553s">They</a>  either sign off yes or they sign off no. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1540.176s">I</a>  know it's a big job and a big undertaking, but I think it's well worth it in the community, because I don't think people especially, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1548.088s">Yes,</a>  I'd like to comment on that that we have engaged and made sure that we have the free and reduced applications in multiple languages they are returned and</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1567.94s">There</a>  is not a requirement for them to be returned. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1570.742s">That's</a>  not a forced item. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1572.523s">However,</a>  we are capturing more free and reduced qualifications because they are incorporated within the portal. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1580.248s">So</a>  we automatically draw those down. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1582.409s">So</a>  it's not necessary that we receive an actual form back from every household. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1586.791s">We</a>  are gathering those and getting those counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1589.973s">regardless</a>  through the portals that have, that's why we've encouraged additional services and we've had outreach with our parent information center. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1599.101s">So</a>  we are providing much more detailed information and encouraging families to participate in these other systems that will provide them additional resources and then also <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1611.302s">automatically</a>  qualify them for free or reduced.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1614.703s">And</a>  my point too is sometimes there's awards for 100% return rate for classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1620.826s">They</a>  get really getting the word out and being a campaign so that the word goes home and people are excited and learning about it because they don't pay attention to every form. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1630.029s">And</a>  it's so important to feed our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1632.29s">And</a>  it's so important for kids that say, oh, we don't have money for our college applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1638.452s">I'm</a>  not applying. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1640.513s">you</a>  know, the tests are covered and the applications are cheaper and like it's so many, many more aspects of this as well as our district could receive more federal funding because of our percentage rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1655.047s">So</a>  that's just a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1657.129s">I</a>  think I made it maybe last year as well.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1660.301s">So</a>  let me just make one clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1662.222s">This</a>  is the breakfast program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1663.823s">This</a>  is not the total numbers of students on free and reduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1668.546s">Not</a>  everybody comes in early enough for breakfast, especially at the high school and places like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1673.188s">So</a>  we'll give you a report with the total numbers, because they're much higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1677.911s">when</a>  you look at the school lunch program as opposed to the breakfast program, which is a more, let's say, niche program that not everybody participates in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1687.053s">It's</a>  one that we'd like to increase, and we've talked to Andrea Silbert over at EOS many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1693.674s">But</a>  I think that the breakfast program doesn't give you a full accurate picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1698.395s">If</a>  just at the high school alone, the number of youngsters who are in free and reduced, who don't pay a user fee for athletics, would tell you that it's much higher than this.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1705.657s">okay</a>  so we'll give you that we'll give you that report I noticed that the Tufts alternative school has a very low participation yeah this really surprised me because I would think it would almost be the natural environment for <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1725.543s">where</a>  kids would be coming in and might pick up some breakfast at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1728.906s">Do</a>  you have any insight into that number?</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1730.567s">Yeah,</a>  I was really surprised by that also. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1732.948s">So</a>  we contacted Mr. Toomey over there, and he said that because they're allowed to come in so much later that most of them just eat before they come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1742.956s">And</a>  they can ask for breakfast, but they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1747.299s">But</a>  I do think that that's definitely an area of opportunity, especially if you could offer a breakfast that might be an incentive for students to come in.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1755.689s">get</a>  them there a little earlier.</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1757.649s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1758.23s">And</a>  the other thing I noticed is most of the schools we see an increase between September and October. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1764.251s">There</a>  was only one school where there was a slight decline and I'm just want to make sure that we we keep on looking at these numbers because I wouldn't want there to be any stigma attached to kids going in for breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1777.915s">That's</a>  why I think the classroom is <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1780.095s">environment</a>  really is ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1783.097s">And</a>  if it works at the Columbus, maybe if we could talk to some of the principals and ask another one to try it for a month and see how it goes, just to see what kind of participation we have then.</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1796.505s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1797.305s">I</a>  know for the past two years in a row, the Eos Foundation has awarded the Columbus a Healthy Start Award, and they give those to schools that see breakfast participation rates <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1808.932s">at</a>  80% and higher for so many consecutive months over the course of a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1813.655s">So</a>  their average is over 80% year long. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1816.697s">That's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1820.779s">So</a>  on the motion by Mr. Benedetto, and also I ask that the superintendent reach out to the various principals to determine if they could do after the bell breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1829.845s">On</a>  that motion, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1831.526s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1831.646s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1832.907s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1834.048s">Thank</a>  you very much, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1834.888s">Smith.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1836.309s">I'd</a>  like to make a motion to suspend the order of business so that we can take up the report on student survey on substance abuse.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1843.775s">There's</a>  a motion for suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1845.997s">Seconded</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1847.638s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1848.058s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1848.899s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1849.82s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1850.58s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1854.464s">Before</a>  our nutritionist leaves, I saw on some social media that the Columbus School was talking about maybe sour milk and some of the things and asked that they just look into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1867.256s">I</a>  saw on some social media about, at the McGlen and definitely at the Columbus, I saw some posts about children not taking the milk because they felt the milk was sour.</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1877.245s">Yes,</a>  yes we are aware of that and I guess what I can say in response to that is we handle the milks appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1885.271s">We</a>  use a first in first out rotation system so the the oldest milks you know are the first ones that are in the coolers and leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1893.558s">I</a>  mean all of the refrigerators are keeping at temp so I think this might potentially be a supplier issue so we'll have to <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1907.434s">Yeah,</a>  but what I can say is from our handling of everything, we're doing everything that we can to ensure that the milks are are at a safe temperature and they are within the best by date. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1920.641s">So</a>  they should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1921.881s">They</a>  should be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1923.842s">So</a>  we have to figure out why they're not.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1926.323s">Would</a>  you like to school committee elect? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1929.605s">Would</a>  you like to step up to the mic, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1931.126s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1931.366s">I</a>  just had a question about.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1934.167s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1934.488s">Through</a>  the chair.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1937.585s">I</a>  had a question about whether the in-class breakfast, how is the milk transported to the classes and how long does it sit in the classes and come back and over and over multiple times a day? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1948.047s">How</a>  do you track that the milk isn't the same milk going to the class for four or five days in a row? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1953.428s">And</a>  is it actually kept cold while it's sitting in the class for an hour or two?</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1957.469s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1958.309s">So</a>  this is for the breakfast in the classroom? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1960.869s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1961.289s">So</a>  the breakfast items are transported in coolers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1965.99s">And</a>  they leave that morning and go. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1968.852s">And</a>  I don't know what the exact time frame is, but they're kept in coolers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1972.734s">And</a>  so they are used probably, I would say, within an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1976.336s">And</a>  any of the milks that come back are discarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1980.599s">So</a>  that should not be contributing to the issue.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1985.362s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1987.753s">Okay,</a>  item four, based on suspension of the rules, report on student survey on substance abuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1994.159s">We</a>  have with us Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1995.1s">Penny</a>  Funny-Elite from Medford City Hall Team Medford to do a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2001.065s">Do</a>  you need us to move at all, Penny?</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2003.587s">Maybe.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2004.247s">Let</a>  me just turn on this projector and we shall see. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2017.618s">Okay,</a>  so thank you for having me today. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2035.386s">I'm</a>  here to present the data, but I do not do my work alone, and Tony Vento and Rachel Perry are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2042.213s">to</a>  talk about the work that they do in the schools that really support youth substance use and prevention of youth substance use in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2050.7s">So</a>  I just want to say this is a report on a survey called the Community Care Survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2055.725s">We've</a>  been doing this survey since 2005. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2059.007s">It's</a>  done every two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2060.409s">So</a>  we have a long amount of years to see trends that have changed throughout the time of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2068.597s">Um,</a>  some of the things to note are that what it looks at is it looks at risk and protective factors, as well as frequency of reported use. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2077.242s">So,</a>  this is, the youth take this survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2080.084s">Um,</a>  it's an anonymous survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2082.005s">It</a>  comes back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2083.105s">We</a>  send it to, excuse me, it goes from the school directly to the, uh, the researcher who cleans the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2089.729s">Um,</a>  by cleaning the data, what I mean is that they eliminate any surveys that exaggerate drug use. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2097.233s">or</a>  any other antisocial behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2099.896s">They</a>  eliminate surveys where students report a fictitious drug that's on there, and then anything that's logically inconsistent patterns of drug use, they will eliminate those surveys. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2111.207s">So</a>  let's say they had 100 that were not, you know, valid, they will eliminate those that will not be included in the total count for the survey itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2121.315s">But</a>  what it's doing is it's looking at—we don't ask questions about sexuality, but what risk and protective factors do is that really show what drives young people to do things that are risky for—so that's why we're looking at this larger picture snapshot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2139.8s">A</a>  lot of communities use a youth risk behavior survey, and it really looks at the frequency. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2145.461s">It</a>  doesn't look at some of the community conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2148.682s">So,</a>  it's a large report. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2151.344s">We've</a>  broken it up for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2152.904s">Tonight,</a>  we're going to talk just about substance abuse rates, and then I will come back, if I'm correct, Superintendent Belson, we discussed that I would come back, talk about risk and protective factors, and then come back again and talk about more data that we saw in the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2169.085s">What</a>  I'm doing here by showing you this presentation is that I think that we need to remember that this is not a school problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2177.395s">This</a>  is a societal, family, peer-level, individual-level issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2184.142s">And</a>  to solve anything that we want to see change on these numbers, we really need to be working as <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2189.428s">as</a>  a whole, as a team to be able to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2192.57s">The</a>  school over the years, I've been here since 2008, I began in September 2008 doing this work, and the schools have had tremendous involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2201.454s">The</a>  police department has had tremendous involvement in the work that we've done through the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2207.537s">And</a>  we put out many, many, many instances of putting information out to parents <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2212.479s">And</a>  we have not had public forums where parents come out in droves. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2216.024s">And</a>  that's not that we wish they could get the information that we're putting out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2221.732s">So</a>  one of our urges here tonight is to say to parents, please pay attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2226.059s">We</a>  are doing prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2228.061s">education</a>  for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2229.643s">We</a>  have resources for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2231.364s">We</a>  want to be thinking about substance use prevention long before someone uses substances. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2237.009s">We're</a>  fortunate now in the City of Medford at the Board of Health to have an outreach worker or recovery coach who will <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2245.577s">You</a>  know, between the two of us, we sit and come up with a plan and work with individuals at the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2250.378s">We</a>  do an early intervention program where if youth are found drinking or using drugs, we will bring them in for a three-hour education course, give them a screening to see if they themselves have any issues, and then we will speak directly to their families about getting them help. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2265.822s">Because</a>  we're really pushing that, you know, this is about getting help and getting this solved before it becomes a chronic issue for you and your family. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2273.568s">So</a>  we have these resources available. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2276.733s">We</a>  are begging you to come out to our presentations and or <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2280.942s">access</a>  this information online. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2284.203s">Many</a>  programs for parents are going to be going up on the Mystic Valley Public Health website coming up soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2291.066s">That</a>  will be linked to the city of Medford's website and hopefully to the school's website and to the police's website. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2297.169s">But</a>  in today, if you have an issue and this is a televised, so I'm talking to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2303.572s">Please</a>  go to drugfree.org and look for information there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2306.333s">They</a>  can they can steer you in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2308.934s">So</a>  the survey itself, we're looking at three different measures of use rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2314.598s">We</a>  have lifetime use, so have you ever tried a substance? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2317.24s">Experimentation</a>  is something that happens, but use where it becomes a problem or can lead to a problem, we're looking at that at the 30-day prevalence use rate, so whether or not a student has used a substance within the last month, the last 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2331.35s">That's</a>  what we measure as current use. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2334.623s">And</a>  historically, we've always done the survey prior to the February vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2341.365s">And</a>  this year, I believe in last year as well, the way that the schedule worked out, the survey was done after that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2347.047s">So</a>  that might be something to think about, but I don't see that reflected in the data at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2353.248s">Binge</a>  drinking behavior is reported if five or more drinks in one sitting in the last two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2359.77s">So</a>  that's what we are measuring binge drinking behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2363.381s">So</a>  the purpose of prevention is to delay use. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2369.185s">We</a>  want to drive those youth numbers back. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2372.488s">We</a>  want to do our best to get the people who need help, help, and to reduce the amount of people that are trying, experimenting, and using frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2380.754s">So</a>  what I have here to show you is I have multiple charts that will show you what's happened over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2387.378s">But</a>  this one here, I think, is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2389.82s">So</a>  if you look at the substance use as a bell curve, you're going to have 5% to 10% of the students, they're never going to use substances. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2397.672s">They</a>  may have family history that causes them, they may have some school commitments or some religious commitments that prevent them from using. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2404.882s">And</a>  on the other end, you might have five to 10% of students who were gonna use no matter what prevention measures were put into place because they have family history, they have trauma, they have other leading factors that could drive them towards something of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2420.15s">So</a>  what our goal is is really to drive the numbers back from, we want as many people getting help and more towards that five to 10% of use as opposed to never using. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2432.357s">In</a>  2005, you can see here 71% of high school students, 71.2% of high school students said that they had used alcohol in their lifetime, 9th through 12th graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2443.048s">This</a>  is both the high school and the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2445.511s">In</a>  all of this case, those two schools are combined with the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2449.76s">In</a>  2017, 45.8% of the students said that they had used alcohol in their lifetime. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2456.824s">This</a>  is a significant change in the rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2461.086s">And</a>  this is as a result of the teamwork that I talked about when I first started speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2465.588s">So</a>  what we're doing is working, and we need to continue doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2469.69s">And</a>  we need to continue to bring in more people into the fold and have this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2475.268s">This</a>  is 6th grade, and again, when we report out the data, I have both in your packet, lifetime and 30-day use, but current trends are really where you would see that there's sort of an issue that we would want to be addressing in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2490.032s">That</a>  is where we would put more of our weight in the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2493.272s">So</a>  6th to 8th grade, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2496.493s">As</a>  you can see, over time, we've really brought these numbers down and these numbers are extremely low. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2503.775s">What</a>  you're looking at is, and all of you should have a chart provided with the actual percentages. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2511.197s">I</a>  like to do that because it's hard to read charts sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2514.798s">It</a>  would be on page six, maybe page actually five. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2521.26s">So</a>  for middle school students, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2524.936s">You</a>  know, 30 day use is three point four percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2527.778s">That's</a>  about that's a lot lower than the national average for U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2532.722s">norm</a>  for eighth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2533.723s">It</a>  was seven point three percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2536.225s">And</a>  I can tell you that our eighth graders for were reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2547.334s">All</a>  right, there's reporting seven point nine percent, so we do want to be paying attention to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2553.866s">It's</a>  close to the national average. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2556.127s">It</a>  is a low number, thank goodness, but we should be talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2559.588s">This</a>  is why I'm saying we need to talk early and often. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2563.229s">We</a>  need to be prepared and we need to be ready to have those conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2568.811s">We</a>  all should be talking to our friends' parents so they know what our personal preferences are and plans when they go to their houses, when they go to parties, they go out to football games or whatever it is, that everyone's well aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2581.995s">We</a>  do see the numbers declining. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2583.175s">We</a>  always want to be monitoring the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2585.376s">In</a>  the high school, sorry, at the 9th through 12th grade level, we see the decline as well over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2592.758s">And</a>  we're very pleased to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2597.439s">One</a>  thing that we're monitoring this year that we've never monitored before is vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2601.901s">So</a>  we don't have numbers to compare to the previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2606.582s">But</a>  what we can tell you is <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2610.264s">on</a>  page four. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2618.329s">What</a>  we know right now is that this is what the students reported in February of 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2623.353s">Also</a>  remember all 12th grade data, those students do not go to these school systems any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2630.037s">They</a>  have moved on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2631.158s">So</a>  that is something to be thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2635.581s">We</a>  believe that this number is going up exponentially as we speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2639.842s">Based</a>  on conversations amongst students and staff, there's a lot more concern for vaping, and we need to be thinking about it overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2649.885s">So</a>  this is what vaping is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2651.886s">This</a>  is the most popular vaping product that we're hearing about all over the state, really, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2657.348s">It's</a>  called Juul. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2658.768s">And</a>  it looks like a USB. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2660.93s">You</a>  can actually charge it by using it as a USB in your computer or wherever. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2667.896s">And</a>  one of those is equivalent to one pack of cigarettes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2672.199s">The</a>  most popular product is a mango flavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2676.274s">Call</a>  me crazy, but I think they're marketing to a very specific population. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2681.355s">They</a>  have a very catchy name and very catchy products. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2685.356s">And</a>  anything flavored is going to be really attractive to young people. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2689.517s">Now,</a>  the thing is about this, the other day we were talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2691.938s">And</a>  I said, oh, don't worry. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2692.738s">This</a>  is a patented product. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2695.199s">They're</a>  not going to be making marijuana products with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2698.36s">That's</a>  not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2699.26s">You</a>  can actually inject marijuana oil into this product once the stuff is out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2704.563s">So</a>  you can go on YouTube, and you can learn anything you want to learn about how to hack this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2711.226s">So</a>  it's discreet. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2716.089s">Somebody</a>  could be vaping in here right now, and you may not notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2719.05s">It</a>  can be very discreet in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2721.572s">So</a>  it's something that we really need to be paying attention to. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2724.974s">It's</a>  very covert. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2726.634s">Did</a>  you have something you want to say?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2728.195s">I</a>  heard that students are doing it in classrooms because it looks like just a USB port, and they also can even exhale right into their hoodies and you don't even see anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2740.581s">So</a>  kids in class are actually, they call it dueling.</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2747.163s">No,</a>  finish your report and then I have mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2749.484s">Okay,</a>  so the reality is is that <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2753.486s">There's</a>  a lot of information and misinformation out there about vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2757.49s">But</a>  the main thing that you need to take away from this is that it contains nicotine, and nicotine is one of the most highly addicted drugs in the entire world, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2766.337s">So</a>  there may be speculation that they're going to get hooked on vaping and then they're going to get hooked on cigarettes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2773.804s">I</a>  argue that they're probably going to be hooked on vaping for a very long time is really what the issue is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2779.449s">And</a>  we don't know because there isn't long-term data to show what the effect of this will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2784.334s">Just</a>  like with cigarettes, we didn't know what cigarettes were going to do to us, and now look at where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2789.741s">So</a>  we need to be cautious about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2792.925s">Now,</a>  I want to show you this because <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2795.539s">This</a>  is a product that is also a vaping product. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2798.822s">They</a>  sell these inserts at dispensaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2802.645s">So</a>  if you see something like this, looks like an old timey cigarette holder, that can also be filled with a THC oil of some kind or something, some sort of marijuana derivative product. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2814.388s">So</a>  marijuana has become legalized in Massachusetts, and it's still dangerous for kids to use marijuana. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2823.692s">It</a>  can create long-term changes in the way that their brain responds to addictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2831.456s">It</a>  can do a number of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2833.757s">What</a>  I want to show you in this slide is a very, very busy slide, but I put everything in one slide so that I didn't forget about a single thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2841.04s">Perception</a>  of harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2842.04s">So</a>  great risk of harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2843.2s">This</a>  is how our students said on the survey that if you tried marijuana, you would be at great risk of harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2849.241s">There</a>  were other things, moderate risk, no risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2851.482s">But</a>  this is specifically looking at the term great risk of harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2854.882s">So</a>  the good news is that there are a number of people who do think that you'd be at great risk of harm if you tried marijuana just once. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2861.643s">But</a>  then in some cases, oddly, that smoking it regularly is somehow OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2871.794s">Great</a>  risk harm is a measure that if you look at, this is what the data shows nationally, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2877.977s">That</a>  if you believe it's harmful, you will use it less. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2882.12s">So</a>  what we want to do is make sure that people are well informed of what these drugs and alcohol and everything can do to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2890.913s">But</a>  I feel like these numbers are pretty low. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2892.995s">I</a>  think that this is going to be an ongoing problem for a long time and I'm going to tell you why. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2897.359s">Because</a>  it's very difficult to convey honest facts to young people about marijuana. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2903.765s">And</a>  we as a community really need to hunker down and think about how to present this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2910.672s">If</a>  we provide false facts <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2912.934s">of</a>  scare tactics to young people, it will not change that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2917.155s">It'll</a>  probably make other things worse because then they'll know for a fact that you were lying to them about marijuana. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2922.717s">Maybe</a>  you're lying about cocaine. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2924.278s">Maybe</a>  you're lying about heroin or other opioids. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2927.059s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2927.319s">So</a>  what we want to do is figure out what is our game plan and to really work on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2932.881s">I</a>  know that there is some education in the curriculum, but I think that we can be doing more and we need to be thinking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2940.847s">a</a>  little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2941.627s">I</a>  think that we as a state should have been thinking about this a little bit more all along the way and be prepared because this was going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2948.67s">So</a>  the other thing to be very aware of, which is startling to me even, even though I've seen it all, no I haven't really seen it all, but is that driving with someone under the influence of marijuana is pretty high in high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2965.18s">So</a>  we know one thing for sure, that Mothers Against Drunk Driving did a hell of a job of changing drinking and driving rates amongst young people. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2974.526s">But</a>  we also need to be thinking about this with marijuana as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2978.048s">It</a>  looks to me like almost 30% of high school seniors last year had driven in a car with someone under the influence of marijuana. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2984.552s">And</a>  I think that classically, people who smoke marijuana will go for a joy ride. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2990.156s">They</a>  hop in their car. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2990.896s">It's</a>  sort of a part of the culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2992.807s">is,</a>  you know, getting in your car and getting isolated, getting away from, you know, wherever, especially when you're a teenager because you don't have the freedom to smoke weed in your house or marijuana in your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3001.294s">So</a>  we need to be paying attention to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3004.157s">We</a>  need to be paying very close attention to that, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3008.06s">All</a>  in all, if you were to <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3012.053s">take</a>  a look at these marijuana rates, we are low in use rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3018.655s">We're</a>  lower than most of the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3021.315s">So</a>  I think that, you know, it's really interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3027.457s">Let</a>  me just go back real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3030.058s">Especially</a>  with high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3031.904s">So</a>  marijuana is the gray line, the third line down here, starting on the left, and then it goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3041.671s">2009,</a>  2013, which makes perfect sense, because it's decriminalization. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3045.393s">Medical</a>  marijuana becomes legal, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3047.735s">So</a>  the perception of harm has definitely changed at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3051.357s">But</a>  for some reason, from 2013 into 2017, we're still seeing a decline. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3057.421s">in</a>  that use, in that regular use of marijuana. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3060.062s">But</a>  what typically happens with marijuana use rates is there may be less people who start using marijuana, but the people who use marijuana use it far more chronically. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3070.225s">So</a>  they may use it more. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3071.645s">So</a>  that's something to also be thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3078.439s">And</a>  then finally, we get to the get to the get to the end of the presentation here, where we're doing a lot of things as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3086.107s">I</a>  mentioned the youth diversion program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3089.21s">I</a>  mentioned all the work that we've done over the years, working with the school and the police, working on research, finding evidence based practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3097.439s">That's</a>  what the city has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3099.761s">But</a>  we also have a grant called Partnerships for Success that's specifically focusing on prescription drug prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3107.189s">Our</a>  numbers are very low. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3109.031s">If</a>  you go back to your charts and you look at 30-day use rates, and even, well, I would say look at your lifetime rates of prescription drugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3121.426s">You'll</a>  see that in 2005, the high school students, we had 11.4% of students reporting that they use prescription drugs without a doctor's prescription. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3135.431s">And</a>  you're looking at now <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3137.352s">of</a>  all students ever having tried 3.8 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3141.173s">So</a>  regardless of the situation that's happening in our community with overdoses, we're seeing youth rates decline with opioid use. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3151.037s">I</a>  still see, you know, numbers declining with tranquilizers and then also stimulants are sort of leveled off from the previous year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3159.36s">But</a>  our urge with our grant is to really say we need to be paying attention to all of these prescription drugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3166.823s">They</a>  all cause, you know, can create an effect and cause a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3172.547s">Opioids</a>  are clearly our biggest concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3174.608s">It's</a>  all over the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3176.25s">And</a>  that's a good thing because people are talking about it to their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3179.632s">They're</a>  talking about what's going on with other family members maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3184.235s">My</a>  aunt lives in Indiana. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3185.136s">She</a>  had crazy surgery, and they were all over her prescription pain meds. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3189.619s">So</a>  I was very pleased to hear that, not just in Massachusetts, but other parts of the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3194.042s">Doctors</a>  are paying attention to those pain medications. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3197.385s">But</a>  one thing is I went to Tufts last week, and I did a training on how to use naloxone with Armstrong Ambulance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3204.35s">And</a>  I stated that cocaine is being cut with fentanyl. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3208.193s">on</a>  the street and I had a kid look up at me like, oh. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3211.255s">So</a>  I have, and I'm not saying that kid uses cocaine, my point though being that people are unaware of this and it's very important to know that we have to pay attention to all drug use. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3221.262s">It</a>  should not be about this drug is bad, this one isn't as bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3225.185s">All</a>  drugs are bad because, and alcohol too, because it creates addiction and pathways to addiction then lead to further addiction problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3234.938s">This</a>  is something that we just want to be aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3237.06s">So</a>  anyhow, the Partnerships for Success grant, we have multiple projects that we're working with the school on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3242.726s">One</a>  thing is a health and safety guide went out to all families from, I believe, eighth grade to 11th grade at the end of last year, and it was a 24-page guide, multiple <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3257.201s">multiple</a>  things to think about, where to dispose of drugs, what is vaping, understanding stress in your students, prescription drugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3264.883s">It</a>  was a very well-organized litany of resources as well as information. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3271.165s">That's</a>  one way that we're trying to get information out to parents is direct mailing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3275.786s">Another</a>  thing that we're doing that I think is really important is that we've helped through working with Rachel. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3281.628s">We've</a>  implemented a module on prescription drugs into the 10th grade curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3287.473s">for</a>  the Michigan model. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3289.215s">And</a>  then we have a risk to resiliency professional development series where we're talking about trauma-informed care. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3295.701s">We're</a>  talking about absenteeism. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3298.504s">And</a>  really what we're trying to communicate is that we want to build these kids up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3304.29s">right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3305.131s">If</a>  we just say that you're going to do drugs, you're going to do drugs, they might do drugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3308.915s">You've</a>  told them that's who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3310.637s">We're</a>  trying to really do the opposite of that and try to identify those sparks, those things that make individuals who they are and things that they can find sense of purpose, not our sense of purpose on these kids, but what is their sense of purpose so that they can have that <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3325.373s">driven</a>  internal, you know, guiding thing that keeps them in that 5 to 10% away from substances. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3332.0s">So</a>  we're working with faculty to get them that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3335.364s">So</a>  through the lens of asset building, the lens of looking at kids as though they have positive things to bring to this world, but understanding those risk factors. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3344.333s">And</a>  then finally, we're working with <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3346.355s">two</a>  identified faculty members, one's a coach and one's an after school club advisor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3354.941s">And</a>  we're working with them to do training to all of the school clubs and advisors, because in the city of Medford, that's where kids go after school in the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3362.427s">They</a>  go to the clubs, they go to sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3364.408s">So</a>  we're doing a integrated training with them around developmental relationships. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3369.152s">Just</a>  what I was saying, how do you identify those sparks in that kid? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3372.434s">you</a>  have you have these high high achievers who are overstressed out and you have people who don't participate because the high achievers might be taken over so we're trying to talk about how do you balance that how you facilitate your clubs how do you operate as a club advisor as opposed to a teacher in a classroom so um those are our main programs that we're doing at the city and then i'm going to step back and let um rachel and tony talk about the projects that they've done in the school and then i'll answer questions i'll just thank you penny thank you</p>

    <p>[Rachel Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3400.569s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3401.73s">I</a>  wanted to talk a little bit about vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3404.392s">Penny</a>  had talked about our numbers going down, but we have noticed we're seeing more and more of it here at the high school, so we have addressed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3412.318s">One</a>  thing we have done is on November 21st, there was a meeting, a staff meeting that Nick Tucci actually presented information on vaping to our teachers, to our staff, presented what to look for, what the dangers are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3424.827s">and</a>  what they can do if they see a student actually vaping in class, what the steps are from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3430.13s">Tony</a>  has actually done some information out on our blog, out to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3435.353s">So</a>  that was out, I believe, was that October? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3437.434s">That</a>  was in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3439.775s">What</a>  we're working on right now is another message that goes out to all parents that will be going out in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3446.779s">Mr.</a>  Dempsey and Lisa Dunphy are also working on a video that students will be making <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3452.665s">and</a>  that will actually be presented as a homeroom activity in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3456.207s">So</a>  that will go out to all the students at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3459.709s">We</a>  have set up a presentation for February 8th for all parents where it will be a vaping presentation along with in plain sight, which will be here again at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3469.675s">We</a>  had that at City Hall last year, but we thought it would be something that in light of everything that we could bring back. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3477.06s">And</a>  as part of our Michigan model curriculum, we've added vaping to any <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3483.131s">lesson</a>  that included tobacco, so this is in the second year at the high school and the first year at the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3489.217s">I</a>  did reach out to the principals at the middle schools and they really haven't seen much going on with vaping there, but we have seen the uptick here at the high school.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3497.724s">They</a>  know what to look for in the middle schools, the teachers and?</p>

    <p>[Rachel Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3500.907s">That's</a>  something that we can actually present, that would be the next step to bring it down to the middle school.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3506.012s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3507.78s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3508.601s">I</a>  think some of the health services department activities we've talked about in the past, first being the expert screening that we do in grade nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3517.788s">This</a>  year, we're extending that to grade seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3520.831s">We're</a>  in the process of finishing all the training for the middle school staff so that we can start that after the turn of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3530.198s">And</a>  our high school screening will start in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3533.594s">The</a>  other project the School Health Advisory Council has been involved in is we're reaching out to the community physicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3540.721s">So</a>  we've met with the chief of pediatrics at Winchester Hospital, and we're looking to get onto the agenda for one of their Grand Rounds meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3550.57s">And</a>  we're going to be discussing ways that we as school support staff can work and collaborate with the community physicians so we have better communication, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3560.455s">And</a>  we each understand each other's models and we can be working on the same agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3568.08s">So</a>  we're very pleased to be reaching out into the community for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3574.605s">I</a>  think everything else has been mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3577.907s">But</a>  our real goal is to get out education to parents and to faculty this year about all these changes.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3585.798s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3586.499s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3586.679s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3587.359s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3587.819s">First</a>  of all, I just want to say thank you to all of you and everyone who's involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3592.061s">The</a>  educational piece in this is extremely important, and the work that you've done has been extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3597.183s">So</a>  I want to say thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3598.664s">But</a>  I do have some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3600.345s">And</a>  as far as the survey, Penny, when the survey goes out, are there questions on the survey asking, like, when do they do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3609.949s">Is</a>  it weekends? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3610.77s">Is</a>  it, you know, after school, before school, during school? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3614.551s">Why</a>  are they doing it? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3615.732s">Are</a>  they doing it just as an experimental, one-time thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3619.334s">Are</a>  they doing it because they're bored? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3620.815s">They're</a>  doing it because there's peer pressure? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3624.237s">You</a>  know, different questions like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3626.498s">Is</a>  there anything like that in the survey?</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3628.179s">No,</a>  there's no questions like that, but there are questions about where they get their alcohol, or I believe it's just alcohol.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3635.003s">But</a>  I do think it is important, not that I'm saying that, no matter when anyone uses anything like this, it's always important. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3642.366s">But</a>  I think if we could at least get a base on, well, gee, it's happening more on the weekends, it's happening after school, it's happening for our students that are busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3652.491s">Are</a>  they doing it more when it's not their season? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3655.553s">Are</a>  they doing it when it's not their hockey season, or their soccer season, or their football season? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3660.695s">Or</a>  is it for our drama students? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3662.859s">And</a>  I'm not picking on clubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3664.421s">I'm</a>  just saying as examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3666.785s">Is</a>  it students that are always involved with a particular project that they're in, or a team that they're on, or a debate after school? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3675.979s">that</a>  kind of makes them think twice because they definitely know the repercussions of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3681.243s">And</a>  I think for us all, I think it would be very important to know because if we could stop pinpointing where these stats go, okay, it's lower at this time, it's higher at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3692.431s">Is</a>  it around final exams? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3695.593s">Is</a>  it around MCAS? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3697.214s">Is</a>  it around the parks? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3698.815s">There's</a>  so many variables and I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3702.857s">We,</a>  you have done this survey now for the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3705.8s">I</a>  mean, as a school committee member and as a parent, I think I would like to see it a little bit more expand. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3711.364s">I</a>  know it's a lot more work, but to expand it to really see the pinpoint of where these students, you know, and why they're doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3720.292s">Sometimes</a>  there's no answers to those questions, and I totally understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3724.655s">The</a>  other thing I was going to ask you, too, is you had mentioned about, and I apologize if I used the wrong terminology, but the interventions, if you find that there's a group of students that are having a party, and then you bring them in for a three-hour workshop. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3742.829s">Have</a>  we found those numbers to go up? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3744.85s">No,</a>  those numbers are very low, actually.</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3748.011s">Our</a>  police officer, we've been doing this project since 2012, and it's been rolled out for about three years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3759.011s">The</a>  numbers are very low. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3761.552s">We</a>  just are not seeing very many kids in the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3763.894s">Not</a>  by we. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3764.974s">I'm</a>  not a patrol officer, but the patrol officer not seeing people out in the park very often. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3769.457s">We've</a>  sent out youth car specifically for that on high, you know, incident times. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3774.179s">And</a>  they're just not having as many of those calls coming in as they did years in the in the years past. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3782.038s">So</a>  I think that it's very interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3785.424s">So</a>  what I would say to you is this about those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3787.928s">I</a>  just want to answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3789.731s">This</a>  survey is a national survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3794.57s">The</a>  questions that are on there are vetted through research. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3799.792s">So</a>  to add more questions on, this is already 200 questions for the students to sit and get through, which is much, is far more extensive than the YRBS that others ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3811.576s">So</a>  we're already asking a lot from these kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3813.497s">But</a>  the other thing is, is that we can get some of that information just through a different method. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3818.059s">We</a>  could use focus groups, key informant interviews, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3821.84s">We</a>  would just need to find a way to get like a third party to come in, you know, and to do that and to set those up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3827.825s">So</a>  for instance, I'm calling out to all the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3830.587s">If</a>  parents know that, you know, they want to know this information and they're willing to sign a permission slip, we have already have the means to start asking questions like this and getting qualitative data for us to find more out about when and where and how this is happening in the city.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3846.491s">I</a>  just think it's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3848.012s">I</a>  mean, I understand the national one because you do want to compare us to everyone else, but the bottom line is also we want to make sure of what's happening in our own backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3857.821s">And</a>  I think that, you know, again, it's not forcing anyone to, you know, to answer these questions, but I think it's really important to know when <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3865.788s">and</a>  certain things are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3867.649s">And</a>  as far as to go back to kids hanging around the park, kids haven't been hanging around the park in a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3874.31s">That</a>  doesn't really happen as much anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3876.471s">Years</a>  ago, parents allowed kids to hang around the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3879.572s">Nowadays,</a>  they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3881.172s">But</a>  that doesn't mean that just because they're not, things aren't happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3885.254s">And</a>  I don't want to put blinders on and say that everybody's perfect and nothing's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3890.055s">But</a>  unfortunately, we have seen, and I'm not saying it in the city of Medford, and I'm not saying it doesn't happen in the city of Medford, but unfortunately, we have seen situations from, you know, it hits the media or whatever that, well, you know, gee, parents think, well, my kids are gonna go out and drink anyway, so why don't we all have them downstairs in the basement? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3909.571s">Or</a>  gee, you know, they're gonna be doing that anyway, so why don't we have them, you know, here? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3914.215s">So</a>  just because they're not in a so-called park, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3918.759s">I</a>  still think that we have to have our ears and eyes open. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3921.301s">And</a>  that's why I was saying, if our administration, if teachers hear anything about this big party going on or anything like that, hey, if the police officers happen to be around that area at that time, and it's not a get you, I have to get you type of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3939.057s">It's</a>  really to be more preventative before anything happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3943.662s">That's</a>  all it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3946.044s">And</a>  as far as the vaporing and the marijuana, I mean, my opinion is it's because now the legalization of it all, and I think that, you know, students and anyone who had the mentality before saying, oh, gee, it was marijuana that didn't want to touch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3963.197s">Now,</a>  like, oh, it's marijuana because, like, we can't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3966.78s">And</a>  I've seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3967.821s">I've</a>  seen it this summer especially. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3969.722s">I've</a>  seen it, like, you know, people just, you know, smoking it, going down the street, and you have young children with you, and now young children are, like, smelling it, and you're smelling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3979.691s">And</a>  here we were years ago saying, you know, well, gee, do you know what, you know, secondhand smoking does? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3984.055s">Now</a>  we have to explain to our kids, you know, well, gee, secondhand marijuana, inhaling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3990.517s">You</a>  know, and it's a very, very concerning situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3994.199s">I</a>  know that as a school system, we've been lucky enough to say, yes, we can ban it because we ban cigarettes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4000.941s">You're</a>  not allowed to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4003.002s">I</a>  just don't know if that number now is rising because students, you know, it's a new thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4008.704s">And</a>  I don't know if it's the mentality of it all, and we could do it, it's not a big deal, it's not as bad as the cigarettes, because we don't have anything healthier yet to prove that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4018.689s">So</a>  I don't know if those numbers are going up because of it.</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4023.391s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I have a very extensive conversation with one of the classes here a couple months ago about vaping, about marijuana, and you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4037.263s">They</a>  were really practical. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4040.648s">They</a>  want to know where the research is? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4043.014s">They</a>  want to see the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4044.894s">This</a>  is a good thing in many ways, because these are well-educated young people who are researching information on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4052.036s">On</a>  the same hand, they want to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4055.997s">And</a>  unfortunately, it's not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4057.137s">It's</a>  not provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4058.598s">But</a>  I pushed them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4061.218s">I</a>  pushed them far and hard to think about this in a broader context. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4065.159s">And</a>  we had a really rich discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4068.04s">And</a>  I think that there's tons of opportunity for us to have youth-led <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4073.403s">initiatives</a>  that talk about vaping, that talk about marijuana use, I think that we can <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4077.817s">definitely</a>  be looking at that in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4079.899s">These</a>  are really brilliant kids in the school, so I'd be very interested to start doing that.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4085.883s">Just</a>  two more questions real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4087.985s">One</a>  is to both Tony and Rachel. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4090.407s">You</a>  were saying that you're speaking to our teachers more and more now about the way to be more aware of it, to be more cautious of it, and they know what the next steps are, but what do the students know? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4100.295s">What</a>  are their next steps? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4101.776s">If</a>  they're caught with it, what happens?</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4105.399s">The</a>  administration would follow <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4107.139s">the</a>  discipline codes that are in the handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4109.461s">So</a>  it's similar to using, God bless you, tobacco products. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4113.464s">So</a>  they would follow those discipline codes.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4118.569s">And</a>  I guess, Penny, the other thing is for you is I know that you've done a lot of outreach, but is there still any one-to-one on with the schools, like when they have parent-teacher nights, or if they're doing a special thing in their schools, is there anything going on that you have a table set up? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4135.163s">So</a>  because I know it's difficult sometimes to get parents out because everyone is busy, but sometimes if they're there and I don't want to overtake another meeting, but I'm just saying that if you know that you're going to get a good crowd out there because of that meeting, is there something set up that night? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4151.522s">with</a>  your information, with someone out there to talk, or maybe even have a five-minute, you know, discussion with the audience.</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4159.473s">So</a>  over the years, there's been, you know, a myriad of ways that I've been included in these types of events. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4166.917s">I've</a>  had opportunities to speak before the parent teacher night presentation begins and that table there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4174.824s">I've</a>  had, you know, the best part about the city of Medford and the work that we've done here is that this community really takes on the work themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4186.575s">And</a>  so when high quality information is being put out, I don't need to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4191.819s">just</a>  to be a steward over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4193.76s">It's</a>  being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4194.861s">So</a>  all the stuff that happens for when DA Ryan comes and talks about social host liability, that's a tremendous program, and that's happening on a regular yearly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4205.647s">So</a>  those are the kinds of things that we really, really shows how <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4210.201s">much</a>  effort is being put in by the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4214.023s">Last</a>  year we had Dr. Ruth Cody come and do a presentation as a partnership and there were 75 people there but the majority were faculty and other people that work in school systems throughout the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4227.41s">So</a>  again, the first time we ever had a presentation here it was <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4231.752s">Be</a>  a parent, not a pal, social host liability, just like the DAs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4236.216s">There</a>  were three people that showed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4239.259s">And</a>  there was 2,400 mail outs that went out advertising this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4243.663s">So</a>  it's just like, it's nice to see when people do come and we get to talk to them and they see that we're not, but really what happens is when we do a community table, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4254.873s">This</a>  is very scary to people to talk about substance abuse when you're talking about a 7th grade kid or even a 7 year old or even a high school kid who you've never seen have an issue with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4266.762s">They</a>  do not want to talk to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4268.003s">That's</a>  why we're called Team Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4269.744s">people</a>  because people just don't want to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4272.826s">So</a>  it's very rare that you get a good, you know, showing out at your table at the community tabling events, but it is worth it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4281.61s">We</a>  do often have a really good conversation with at least one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4285.332s">So,</a>  yes, I mean, we go to as many as we can, and we'll continue to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4291.17s">I'd</a>  like to see where it's actually an institutionalized conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4295.216s">It's</a>  not just like, oh, the substance abuse people are coming and walking in and they're going to tell you some information. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4299.943s">It's</a>  nice when we're coming and we're asked to be experts, but it's really a part of the growth of an individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4306.132s">to</a>  be talking about this, so I think that it should be sort of embedded in everything.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4309.695s">Well,</a>  that's why I was saying, I know having you come in just by yourselves, even though you have a great program, it's just, as you mentioned, scary sometimes, and people don't want to hear it sometimes, and so this way here, instead of having it directly, that's why I was saying if there was some collaboration, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4326.769s">And</a>  I know that you've had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4328.069s">Yeah,</a>  and I know that they've had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4330.27s">I</a>  just for people that are watching that don't know about it, you know, and maybe they don't feel comfortable calling you, but they might feel comfortable calling a principal or a teacher or, you know, or a child listening, you know, happens to listen to this and and asks another, you know, another student. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4346.735s">At</a>  least they know that, gee, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4348.415s">They</a>  don't have to necessarily call you directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4350.957s">They</a>  can go to someone because they know that you're all working together.</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4354.12s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4354.74s">That's</a>  absolutely true. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4356.021s">And</a>  one of the biggest things for their buck in the college setting is how to help a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4362.567s">And</a>  we worked with a student last year to put up posters that were about how to help a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4367.771s">And</a>  so they're advertised to the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4370.593s">about</a>  how do you get resources for your friends, and they're up, but again, do they see them? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4376.556s">Unless</a>  we paid a million dollars to have a Snapchat story commercial, I don't know if anyone's ever gonna see it, let's be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4384.32s">But</a>  we're putting them up.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4387.762s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4388.562s">Through</a>  you to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4391.544s">Do</a>  we have a vaping policy on the books, or are we using the tobacco policy?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4396.47s">So</a>  we're using the tobacco policy because vaping is sort of a derivative. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4401.732s">But</a>  as we move forward, we'll obviously specify a little bit more completely.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4406.055s">Well,</a>  with the growth I see throughout, not just our community, but socially, in adults as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4413.738s">high</a>  school age students, I would like for this committee to start working on that, so that way it's in our handbooks as vaping, as juuling, as the correct terminology, so students are very clear how we as adults feel in this community about this, because students just do not believe, they think that, oh, I quit smoking, I'm only vaping now, and that's what you hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4438.757s">and</a>  they don't realize when it gets in their lungs it's like popcorn and it blows up their lungs and it does all these health implications and there's not a lot of data because they haven't been doing it for years, but having two people in my house who read this report before I got here, 27 and, almost 27 and almost 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4457.924s">One's</a>  a future NP and one works in another community on these exact programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4464.786s">They</a>  were happy to see our numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4467.507s">that</a>  we're doing a great job in MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4470.13s">We</a>  want to be clear, call it what it is, name it, say it's not okay, and tell them that from day one, so that way the wording is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4479.022s">Because</a>  once you name something, it's not like this secret thing anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4482.386s">It's</a>  not as cool, not as fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4484.789s">So</a>  that's a motion on the floor and I need a second from one of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4489.933s">I'd</a>  like to see this in place and in every handbook at our junior high and high school level by next year so that parents know that this is happening in our community and that we're taking it seriously and we're not gonna continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4505.387s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4505.707s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4506.508s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4506.688s">Vander</a>  Kloof. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4507.968s">Penny,</a>  last spring I was able to attend, and I don't remember the title of it, but the Night of Remembrance for those who had died of opiate deaths, related deaths. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4520.775s">And</a>  one of the things, and it was a very powerful presentation, but there were two speakers that particularly impacted me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4526.458s">They</a>  were both students who had previously attended Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4531.081s">And</a>  one of the things that they said was they both said they actually were pretty good kids here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4536.866s">They</a>  were, you know, were popular. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4539.948s">They</a>  were, you know, kids who were not involved, particularly with drugs or alcohol at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4548.755s">And</a>  one of my biggest concerns is, I think we're doing good work laying a positive foundation here, but I'm totally worried about that transition off to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4560.599s">And</a>  I'm not sure, you just mentioned some posters, how to help a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4564.301s">And</a>  we see these incredible stories of the Fratt brothers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4569.022s">who</a>  are drinking too much and then let their frat brother die. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4573.644s">And</a>  that's where I'm wondering, our last, we're touching the kids at 10th grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4580.047s">I</a>  don't know whether we're discussing at that point, hey, when you get to college, these are things to expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4587.33s">I'm</a>  just concerned about that transition to college and loneliness too. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4592.132s">For</a>  some kids, when they go off, we put so much, hey, we're going to college and then all of a sudden they get there and it's kind of a little lonely sometimes.</p>

    <p>[Rachel Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4598.157s">So</a>  we do touch upon that in 10th grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4600.198s">Last</a>  year, we actually had Armstrong Ambulance come in, and they did a training for all of our seniors going off to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4606.842s">They</a>  talked about drugs, drug use, overdoses. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4610.864s">They</a>  learned how to do CPR, first aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4614.606s">So</a>  that was actually something that we started last year to help those students transitioning from senior year into college.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4622.034s">Also,</a>  I just wondered, those two speakers who were there that night, have they come and spoken? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4627.277s">I</a>  know that they both expressed willingness to me and others to come and talk directly to students, and I've wondered if you might. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4638.663s">I'm</a>  sure you have the names, and they certainly expressed their willingness to me, and I think that we might, it might be valuable.</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4646.679s">I</a>  apologize for not including the naloxone training to seniors and also to our vocational students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4655.327s">We</a>  do a lot of stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4657.949s">So</a>  I apologize, because that's a big one, though, because it does start to talk about this missing population, 18 to 28-year-olds, I would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4667.296s">One</a>  of the things that we're doing that's really a big cornerstone in our office is we're doing a lot of work working with trying to address overdose rates and the trades. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4678.565s">And</a>  so we've worked with Heidi. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4683.048s">last</a>  year did a great job of getting us in and we had that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4686.63s">So</a>  we talked about dangers on the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4690.112s">We</a>  met with all the vocational students that were in co-op and we talked about injuries on the job, what to do if there's an injury from a tourniquet to how to use naloxone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4700.717s">And</a>  we had some really great conversations, super bright nursing, CNA students and just really, really good conversations there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4707.9s">So</a>  that's one way that we should be thinking about and continuing to partner about <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4712.428s">You</a>  know, working with those employers who are taking on our students and what are they doing, what are their practices, we've created a toolkit for workers on a <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4721.409s">how</a>  to understand the laws that pertain to them as well as to their employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4726.01s">So</a>  we've done a lot of work around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4728.07s">That</a>  gets at the population that's not going off to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4730.791s">But</a>  I think that one thing that Danielle from Armstrong Ambulance would say is that the majority of the students were staying in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4739.213s">And</a>  so it's really about all of us thinking, all of our school systems thinking as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4745.341s">about</a>  how to teach kids the same information across the board, so when they do go to school, they're still taking care of each other and helping each other out.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4752.946s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4754.547s">So</a>  when you're doing that training this year for CPI or First Aid, can we add back-end training?</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4761.031s">It's</a>  already in it.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4761.912s">It's</a>  already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4763.833s">And</a>  is that for both the high school and the vocational schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4766.555s">It</a>  is seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4768.016s">So</a>  that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4769.057s">I</a>  think that's wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4770.678s">Mr.</a>  Ternagli?</p>

    <p>[Sebastian Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4774.908s">I</a>  think that the, so in the school, I think that the reason that, as you stated many times, the reason that people do dueling so much is just because they think it's not bad, and also that it seems clean, and they don't think that it's hurtful. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4790.541s">One</a>  thing that I think is, would be really effective, similar to the 74% of students <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4798.244s">Medford</a>  students are marijuana-free. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4801.486s">I</a>  thought that was really effective, just having the facts up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4805.508s">So</a>  I think something that could be really effective in the school, like maybe picking three or four facts from one Juul pod contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes, you'd be surprised how many people pay attention to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4822.556s">And</a>  especially, as you mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4826.563s">the</a>  facts are not out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4828.184s">And</a>  people would be really, it would change the perception of the problem at hand before it really takes root over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4840.371s">So,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4841.522s">That's</a>  called social norming, and you just identified a scientific research study, evidence-based, but it works, and we have done posters in the past that we believe could have driven those numbers continually down, talking about how many students actually don't use marijuana. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4857.097s">It's</a>  interesting when you are someone who's using substances, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4860.84s">Your</a>  peer group's probably using substances, thus the whole entire world is using substances. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4865.765s">So</a>  that's something to be thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4867.567s">It's</a>  really important to get the facts out there and to really show that there's a lot of kids who just don't do this stuff, a lot of students.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4874.915s">Can</a>  you yield to Miss O'Brien? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4876.256s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4876.836s">Miss</a>  O'Brien.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4877.577s">So</a>  back when I was in high school, I was part of the Above the Influence Club for a while with Miss Perry as my advisor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4883.341s">And</a>  we had Chris Herron come and speak to all the athletes in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4887.024s">It</a>  was mandatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4887.804s">You</a>  couldn't even play the spring sport unless you went and saw Chris Herron. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4891.827s">And</a>  I think that was such a positive thing for us as high schoolers to see someone who's young and who overcame something and made something of his life, who <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4902.335s">was</a>  rich at one point and then totally went somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4905.118s">And</a>  I feel like that would be so beneficial to have a motivational speaker come in, not even just the athletes, but to everyone in the school should have the opportunity to come see someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4914.246s">Because</a>  it's not just the athletes that fall out of track, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4917.008s">It's</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4917.709s">And</a>  I think a motivational speaker would be totally helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4920.271s">Because</a>  Chris Heron, I know, like my friends, when we left, we were like, oh my gosh. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4924.515s">Like,</a>  wow. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4925.756s">I</a>  know Mary Burke's daughter was on the lacrosse team with me and she, it was just amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4929.878s">It</a>  was an amazing experience and I think the children would really benefit from that and I think we should not even open it to just the high school, it should be the middle school too. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4938.441s">And</a>  me being a young teacher and wanting to teach in Medford, I think we have such a strong community and we're so tight bonded and I'm so tight bonded with everyone in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4947.044s">I</a>  feel like I can talk to anyone here and I want to be able to <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4951.606s">I</a>  don't know how to put it, but have people be able to come and talk to the teachers and be comfortable with everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4956.991s">And</a>  I think a motivational speaker coming in would be just a great aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4960.734s">I</a>  don't know how Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4961.455s">Perry</a>  got Chris Hirons. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4962.716s">Maybe</a>  she could come about that again, but I know he does motivational speaking all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4967.521s">I</a>  follow him on Twitter. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4968.301s">I</a>  think he's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4969.883s">And</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4971.204s">Great</a>  recommendation, Hannah. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4973.946s">Mr.</a>  Skerry.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4986.4s">Betty</a>  can give you more stats. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4988.16s">Can</a>  I follow up on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4989.921s">But</a>  actually, I wondered, I think that one in our report, that one stat about one jewel can have whatever it was, one jewel contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5001.703s">It's</a>  just so striking that it is time for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5005.203s">We</a>  have a graphics arts department. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5006.524s">We</a>  can get some posters made up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5008.784s">I</a>  think that that would be incredibly valuable to right away get out.</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5011.984s">I</a>  think you should also know that one of those pods is like, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5015.547s">$4.00,</a>  like four or five bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5018.584s">So</a>  a lot cheaper than a pack. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5021.205s">And</a>  no taxes, or is it a tax on that stuff?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5024.065s">No,</a>  it's online. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5025.146s">I</a>  don't know if it's taxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5026.226s">Conceals</a>  tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5027.566s">Conceals</a>  tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5028.466s">So</a>  our community, the Board of Health passed that you cannot sell to minors. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5032.187s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5032.427s">Bless</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5032.807s">God</a>  bless you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5082.574s">I</a>  have two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5084.314s">The</a>  first is, so the alcohol use from the sixth to eighth grade dropped pretty precipitously from 2011 to 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5092.236s">And</a>  I was wondering what accounts for that drop. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5095.777s">And</a>  the second thing I had is maybe just helping us understand the analytics. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5099.197s">So</a>  you have children completing a survey <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5103.2s">Do</a>  we have any sense of how many people are actually users but are concerned that if they fill out this survey with this information it will be seen by a teacher that they're handing it in? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5113.346s">Do</a>  we have a sense of like heroin use? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5115.127s">I</a>  know overdose is a serious issue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5118.369s">So</a>  do we have a sense of underage heroin overdoses in Medford right now?</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5123.232s">There</a>  are no underage heroin overdoses in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5127.034s">There</a>  was an individual who was 19 that overdosed and died in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5131.397s">They</a>  were from another community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5132.718s">So</a>  that's something to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5137.441s">So</a>  I have it here at the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5139.442s">But</a>  these numbers are so small that it's very, you have to really think about that, that this is like points. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5149.282s">1%</a>  of the entire population that took it reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5151.505s">That</a>  could be one student. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5153.108s">So</a>  there's something to think about when you're looking at that data. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5155.793s">So</a>  it's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5157.656s">But</a>  your question is about.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5161.029s">Oh,</a>  what was the drop? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5163.711s">The</a>  drop was pretty significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5165.113s">If</a>  you have 10%, that's a significant selection.</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5167.755s">It</a>  is a significant drop. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5168.416s">And</a>  what we saw at that time was we saw an increase in parental monitoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5174.281s">If</a>  you were to look at the risk and protective factors, we talked about in 2011, there were some protective factors that were very low in the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5183.789s">And</a>  by the next year, they were exactly even with their sister scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5189.054s">So</a>  the deal was is that there were many opportunities for rewards if you do something in the school, but there weren't very many opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5200.364s">So</a>  when those two came together and they were evened out, we talked about it at the school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5205.288s">We</a>  talked about it with the principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5207.23s">There</a>  was a whole influx of new activities after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5210.913s">activities</a>  that started to happen, those numbers became aligned and we saw that number drop. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5215.795s">So</a>  parents were monitoring their kids more closely. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5219.957s">The</a>  schools addressed some of the pro-social things that needed to be addressed in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5225.139s">It</a>  was a real sort of like chasm of everybody working together, I think, and that really helped drive those numbers down.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5231.942s">And</a>  do you have a sense of how many kids are using but don't report on the survey?</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5236.768s">So</a>  that's just sort of a given with these surveys, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5242.307s">To</a>  be honest with you, a lot of people who are using substances know very well that they don't want to be using substances, and so they do self-report pretty accurately on these surveys. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5251.93s">They</a>  may not want to be forthcoming with someone that knows them and may feel shame if they were to report, but when it's anonymous, it's secretive. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5261.533s">They</a>  actually do fill them out pretty accurately. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5263.273s">At</a>  least that's what, nationally, that's what the story has been. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5268.795s">I</a>  don't have the exact scientific fact for you, but that's what I do know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5273.736s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5274.356s">Is</a>  there a motion to receive this report? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5276.277s">One</a>  more question, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5276.957s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5277.417s">Actually,</a>  I was just thinking of the bullet points that we were talking about, whether it be Sebastian or both of you, is the other one about getting into our vehicle with someone who's been vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5288.3s">Yeah,</a>  which is very important and it's very serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5292.942s">And</a>  I don't and I think that would be a bullet point really put out there, because I don't think people are aware of how serious that could be, because we're you know, we've been trained in our mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5304.005s">And</a>  as as kids, we've been trained in our minds to is, you know, you don't get into a vehicle with someone who's been drinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5309.887s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5310.387s">No</a>  one's been talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5311.648s">This</a>  is, you know, newer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5313.188s">So</a>  I think that's definitely a point we need to put out there.</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5316.009s">Yeah,</a>  I think it's a really important one to talk about for sure.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5319.731s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5320.111s">On</a>  the motion this report being received and placed on file, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5324.033s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5324.453s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5325.393s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5326.114s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5332.456s">Okay,</a>  motion to revert to the regular order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5335.979s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5336.859s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5337.259s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5338.6s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5339.881s">Report</a>  one, recommendation to approve Medford High School, Medford-Volk Tech High School graduation date and location. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5345.445s">Move</a>  approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5345.945s">Motion</a>  to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5346.726s">Superintendent,</a>  you want me just to announce the date?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5349.428s">Well,</a>  we can just make one quick comment, as we've done this at this place every year for a long time now, and the reason we need to approve it so early is that if we have snow days, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5361.1s">you</a>  know, we've locked in the date. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5363.001s">So</a>  we don't have to have, you know, so many days. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5366.882s">But</a>  if there are no snow days, we don't have to worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5369.703s">And</a>  the other thing that I just will let you know is that Mr. William Cummings of the Cummings Foundation will speak at graduation in addition to the normal speakers.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5379.766s">That's</a>  exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5381.007s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5381.367s">So</a>  it's June 6th, all those parents out there, at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5385.048s">at</a>  the Gancher Center at Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5388.629s">Motion</a>  to approve by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5391.112s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5391.593s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5392.414s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5393.155s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5394.016s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5396.739s">Financial</a>  report, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5398.101s">Patterson.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5402.628s">So</a>  this is our first quarterly or close to one third of the year report on our financials. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5409.953s">The</a>  general fund operating budget for FY 18 is fifty six million four hundred thirty one thousand, of which year to date we have spent forty two percent, forty two point nine percent, which is the total of twenty four million two hundred and fifteen thousand seven eighty six. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5426.063s">And</a>  that includes both our expenditures and our encumbrances, which is <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5430.646s">reserving</a>  funds for anticipated and projected expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5435.271s">So</a>  of the amount spent to date, our 10-month biweekly employees have received nine of their checks since August 28th, with an additional special run in October to accommodate the anticipated number of checks per calendar year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5449.457s">And</a>  all 12-month employees have received 11 of their paychecks since July 1, the first start of the new fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5456.685s">So</a>  we have many staff members out on maternity leave with some additional expected in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5462.612s">Currently,</a>  we have nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5464.254s">So</a>  there are some significant increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5467.077s">coverages</a>  that we're maintaining that is also long-term sub-capacities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5473.142s">And</a>  while there has been significant transition for teaching and other staff members during this school year, we have been able to fill the positions based on the program needs and will continue to do so as those arise. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5486.854s">The</a>  business office is fully staffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5489.735s">We</a>  transitioned from some various leaves and had significant turnover over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5495.577s">So</a>  we are in the process of reclassifying our payroll codes to reflect correct budget items and be in line with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5504.021s">where</a>  they were reflected for the departmental charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5507.442s">We</a>  are also excited and encouraged to be rolling out and implementing a new automated onboarding process for the hiring and tracking that will greatly improve our laborious process for new hires and streamlining documentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5523.868s">This</a>  will also be rolled out to current employees for data changes and updates, and it is a <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5531.09s">subsequent</a>  system for the current attendance ASOP system that we use with Frontline. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5536.36s">And</a>  it will also include a mobile app. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5538.744s">So</a>  that will greatly improve utilization. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5542.749s">So</a>  as we continue to respond to the DESE, Department of Ed chart of account change structures, as well as additional reporting components that they have for us, we have to report and track expenses by a number of different areas, which include by school, by function code, by category, district wide, and expanding out to individual grants, the higher level grants, such as Title I and special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5570.95s">So</a>  within the operating budget where some budget columns may be zero, the planned cost projections are included in those breakout items and the balances within each function remain to be positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5584.863s">So</a>  we please also note that the encumbrance column, it does include amounts that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5591.95s">included</a>  our best projections for year end expenditures. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5596.693s">So</a>  those will continue to be monitored, liquidated and updated as costs are trued up, as the invoices come in and actual payments are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5605.176s">relieved.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5606.537s">So</a>  included with the summary are some of the key program areas within our general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5612.401s">The</a>  first of which and is the largest component of our budget is salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5616.784s">In</a>  fiscal year 2018 we have two salary increments that were awarded for the collective bargaining units. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5624.63s">The</a>  first was in July or and or the start of their <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5628.272s">contract</a>  and the second increase will be in January for the appropriate CBA groups and that will be another 1%. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5638.736s">So</a>  the undistributed allocation will be dispersed among the budget adjustments for different program areas so as we identify the increases in certain areas we will be reallocating some of those amounts for <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5654.662s">personnel</a>  changes, retirement buybacks and the such. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5659.225s">Another</a>  area of interest is security. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5662.087s">Large</a>  investments have been made to replace and repair the security cameras throughout the district at all buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5668.93s">So</a>  the amount of $194,949 within the budget is earmarked for the security program reporting area. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5676.515s">However,</a>  it will most likely be shifted to a capital account once appropriated. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5682.025s">We</a>  expect that the projects will be completed at all schools by mid-December and we will follow up with a detailed report. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5689.492s">There</a>  have been many schools that have finalized the completion of those repairs and we will be updating as they <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5697.779s">finalized</a>  as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5699.281s">So</a>  security in the buildings is a priority and the district continues to demonstrate its commitment to ensuring safety in the multiple areas and that includes our staffing, training our staff members, cameras, security cameras, and identification stops at entrance locations which include the Raptor license scanning and name tag system. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5720.831s">Our</a>  technology is another significant area where the committee decided to infuse the system with significant funding at each of the school systems, at each school building. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5733.243s">There</a>  was 15,000 earmarked for the high school level, 5,000 for Curtis Tufts, 15,000 for the middle schools, and 13,000 for each elementary school, which was significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5744.533s">We</a>  utilized those funds and used some high volume discounts along with state bid pricing to maximize the investment within those technology area and rolled out over the summer to have the carts and units available for the start of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5760.061s">So</a>  in total we had 455 devices, new devices for this school year that were rolled out for use in each of the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5768.982s">And</a>  additionally, within technology, we just received the E-rate approval that will further improve connectivity district-wide, and we're hoping the matching dollars that were requested from the city will be approved, and we'll be able to continue the technology investment throughout school year 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5788.84s">Transportation</a>  continues to be a large item. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5792.961s">We</a>  are currently in year three of the original three-year contract with Eastern Bus, and we have an additional two years locked in at specified rates for that contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5802.564s">The</a>  budget reflects an anticipated reduction of one bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5806.446s">However,</a>  we did have to bring bus number 18 back into <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5811.127s">the</a>  cycle due to the shift in newcomers programs and so we've had to utilize the additional bus for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5818.793s">So</a>  it shows a negative amount within that category based on the need for additional transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5826.758s">We</a>  also have absorbed the cost for students that attend the Minuteman Vocational School, and the amount we expect will be covered by the reduced enrollment in the tuition, so where we had projected additional students going out, and the offset coming in for the transportation will net itself out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5849.417s">We</a>  currently provide after-school buses to the middle schools and that's per contract that was identified in the original contract three buses per day and that's for 70 days throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5862.02s">We've</a>  also indicated that should the elementary schools be considering additional after-school programs there would be some additional costs realized with that and we would need to work with the provider for the levels of <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5879.704s">and</a>  participation and timing of those trips because the routes are all intertwined and combined. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5886.308s">So</a>  there may be possibility for an additional contractor at that point if it was decided and determined to go forward with that additional expense in the transportation area. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5899.186s">Our</a>  utilities, which covers natural gas, electricity, water, we encumber the utilities based on historical years of usage, and we budget conservatively for unexpected occurrences. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5913.969s">So</a>  our natural gas rates have been very favorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5917.449s">Utilization</a>  has been lower due to milder winters. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5921.15s">However,</a>  we still have not experienced the cold months for this fiscal year, so we're not quite sure how that will land. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5928.891s">Electricity</a>  continues to be volatile in the marketplace, and we will be expecting a slightly higher rate beginning next fiscal year, which we have locked in with City Hall working with the Power Options Company. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5943.514s">So</a>  our current rate is slightly lower, which is for the supply cost at .0882 per kilowatt hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5952.716s">Moving</a>  into next fiscal year, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5954.918s">we'll</a>  have .0931, so definitely moving forward as we budget and plan for that, we will need to budget some increases in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5965.421s">But</a>  we have encumbered the entire line item for that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5969.662s">It</a>  has typically gone to the very end of that particular expense, so we wanna maintain a conservative estimate and show that fully expended. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5980.586s">So,</a>  in summary, the first financial report shows that the expenditures are in line with our budget projections. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5988.555s">We</a>  will continue to monitor and review them, and we constantly look at consolidating purchases, utilizing state bids when we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5998.987s">and</a>  the like, and identifying savings wherever possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6002.33s">And</a>  I'd like to, again, thank City Hall, my counterparts at the hall, that communication, cooperation has been very effective in helping us accomplish what we need to get done.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6015.299s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6015.98s">Christina,</a>  I had one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6018.762s">Could</a>  you please explain what you mean by we are reclassifying payroll codes to reflect correct budget lines?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6024.655s">Yes,</a>  so our payroll system is not linked with our financial system, so we outsource payroll, so we have to identify a payroll code that is crosswalked to our general ledger code, a financial software code. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6038.698s">So</a>  those codes, which was a much smaller code number, may not necessarily be aligned with what our either newly identified budget financial account code is, general ledger account. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6051.08s">So</a>  we're going through now and really scouring those areas to look at some anomalies that might be occurring and to make sure that where we budgeted individuals based on department school-wide that they are correctly classified in the payroll code.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6066.265s">Okay,</a>  so it doesn't mean that somebody who was added to the business office or transferred in the role was given different classification?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6074.528s">No,</a>  no, no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6075.708s">This</a>  is strictly an accounting function. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6078.109s">So</a>  identifying the crosswalk from our payroll system to our general fund accounting system.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6086.552s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6086.732s">Kurtz?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6087.633s">Hi,</a>  thank you, Christine. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6089.013s">Thank</a>  you for the reports, excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6090.614s">I</a>  just have one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6092.274s">It</a>  does mention, I was gonna ask about the cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6094.795s">So</a>  it mentions that a large investment was made to replace and repair security cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6099.657s">And</a>  I know a lot of us were getting emails throughout the fall <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6103.818s">where</a>  a lot of parents are very concerned because a lot of cameras were out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6107.923s">and</a>  they weren't operating. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6109.463s">So</a>  are there any cameras that are still in need of repair or were all the cameras that were malfunctioning and not operating? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6118.666s">Were</a>  they all repaired?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6120.366s">So</a>  we've addressed all of the inoperable cameras that were the critical areas for observation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6128.688s">So</a>  all of those have been addressed with the investment that we have provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6133.749s">They</a>  are not all currently complete as the contractor is still working on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6138.371s">So</a>  they have several teams at several locations and they anticipate being complete in the next couple of weeks.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6147.985s">Can</a>  I ask a point of clarification? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6150.506s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6152.686s">So</a>  you said the key point cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6155.147s">Does</a>  that mean all cameras are now online and working or just key points?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6160.688s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6161.428s">As</a>  I mentioned, repairs and replacements have not all been done to this date, to date right now for reporting back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6171.49s">Many</a>  of the schools have been, and they are in process right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6175.131s">So</a>  that's where we will be finalizing the update in a couple of weeks when they are complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6180.513s">So</a>  they did, I believe, the Roberts is complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6183.554s">Some</a>  of the other highly critical areas, but the larger projects that were greater in scale are still ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6193.478s">So</a>  they're in the process of being repaired and replaced.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6196.993s">Do</a>  we have a completion hopeful date?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6200.316s">Two</a>  weeks.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6203.398s">And</a>  then all cameras within the district will be up and running and functioning appropriately?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6210.624s">I</a>  think that it's really important to understand that cameras are fragile. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6215.483s">And</a>  that every year, we're going to have to allocate money for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6219.267s">Because</a>  lightning strikes, all kinds of things take place that are beyond our control. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6225.233s">And</a>  we can go all year long and then find that we need cameras that have to be replaced going into the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6232.464s">I</a>  think the key thing, you know, apropos to your question is, is that are we covering the areas that people need to be, have covered, that people can see? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6239.911s">The</a>  answer is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6242.393s">And</a>  we'll try to, you know, continually <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6245.826s">prioritize</a>  as we go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6247.487s">If</a>  a camera goes down, we certainly want to ensure that a key area is covered, so rather than one that might be a duplicate of an existing area. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6257.814s">But</a>  for the most part, in the middle of December, we believe everything will be fixed.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6264.7s">Just</a>  as another follow-up, I know that Attorney Bill O'Keefe offered to supply us with extra cameras, and even if we have them as a stash of backup cameras, he's more than willing to donate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6278.952s">He</a>  has in the past, and he has more to donate, so I'm making a motion now that the superintendent reach out to him and just see if they're functioning with our system now, and if it's appropriate to have them as backup.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6292.243s">So</a>  let me answer that before we go too far down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6296.144s">Mr.</a>  O'Keefe did provide a substantial number, 30 additional cameras this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6300.806s">Some</a>  of them are not compatible with what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6303.307s">Some</a>  of them can be used for limited purposes, but given what we're doing right now and given the upgrade in technology, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6309.789s">Um,</a>  what's coming out of that institution that Bill gets it from, uh, is not necessarily compatible with what we've got. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6318.416s">There's</a>  a few that can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6319.978s">So,</a>  we've got to screen them out, but we really can't be overly dependent on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6323.561s">We</a>  appreciate what Bill's done, but on the other hand, we've got to be careful that, uh, they're mostly inside cameras, and the things that deal with outside cameras are very different, and we're also dealing with a different way of, uh, of a transmission, uh, than we previously did. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6339.39s">We</a>  can use them periodically, but it's not a one-to-one kind of application, but we do appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6344.554s">I</a>  also make a motion to send him a thank you note. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6347.676s">I</a>  think we did once, but I'll send it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6349.297s">Consistently</a>  over the years providing us with any technology that comes to his hands.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6356.642s">Still</a>  moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6358.063s">Is</a>  there a motion for approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6359.544s">I</a>  had a few questions.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6360.425s">Oh,</a>  I thought you already asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6361.806s">No,</a>  I was just on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6362.766s">So</a>  that was the security issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6364.928s">I</a>  wanted some clarity on the business office team and now that it's fully staffed, what types of movement happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6371.932s">Were</a>  there any positions added? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6373.894s">I'm</a>  just curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6375.174s">I</a>  know we talked about a HR person at one point, the superintendent mentioned something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6379.197s">I</a>  just was wondering what that looks like now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6381.759s">Or</a>  maybe we could even get like, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6383.94s">you</a>  know, a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6385.822s">Yeah,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6387.143s">No,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6388.404s">So</a>  we had a maternity leave that was not covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6392.727s">So</a>  we were understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6394.409s">We</a>  also had transition from one of our team members who went to another department within the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6401.174s">So</a>  we had to fill another payroll position. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6405.078s">So</a>  there's been nothing added. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6406.919s">We've</a>  been backfilling and trying to maintain and keep <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6410.382s">keep</a>  the level of service with less people. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6413.848s">So</a>  there was nobody added except a replacement for an open position that had transferred.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6421.418s">Can</a>  we see that chart anyway, just so the committee members, we have an idea of what the roles are, who's in those roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6429.502s">Yeah,</a>  that would be helpful, because if we have any questions moving forward, of course we'd go through the superintendent, but you know, it's just to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6437.485s">Names</a>  and job titles. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6438.546s">Yeah,</a>  that would be great, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6441.576s">We</a>  do have expectations of coming forward with a proposal as the year progresses to enhance our human resources capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6449.483s">I</a>  mean, it's become a major, major area and you cannot continue to just simply treat it as a byproduct of everything else going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6458.251s">So,</a>  that will come forward as a major proposal and we'll have that discussion.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6464.194s">I</a>  just also want to speak about the community schools budget, and I know that the committee approved almost two years ago about having it quarterly, so just as a friendly reminder that I'd like to see that coming forward soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6479.01s">We</a>  will. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6479.991s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6480.872s">Maybe</a>  we can even add it to the list of items on the back of our agenda so we don't forget, because I might forget.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6488.359s">I</a>  doubt you're going to forget.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6490.76s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor to accept this report? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6493.642s">Motion</a>  to accept the report, place it on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6496.584s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6497.285s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6497.425s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6497.925s">Motion</a>  granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6498.466s">Thank</a>  You Christine.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6513.02s">Item</a>  number three, report on bilingual education legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6516.601s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6518.261s">So,</a>  as you probably know, the state legislature has approved an option for school districts to incorporate bilingual education into the existing SEI format. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6530.604s">Now,</a>  15 years ago, Ron Unz, who came from California, pushed a initiative petition, which he previously had some success in Arizona and California, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6540.546s">and</a>  Massachusetts decided that it would adopt it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6544.99s">It</a>  was given great support from John Silbert at the time, and also Mitt Romney, who was a gubernatorial candidate, and it carried its way. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6552.837s">Since</a>  the time it's been implemented, there's been mixed results. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6557.2s">Sometimes</a>  it works, sometimes it doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6558.801s">But</a>  it comes with that whole idea that, you know, everyone should speak English, and we believe they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6563.041s">But</a>  how to learn to speak English, especially to learn subjects that require deep cognitive knowledge or cognitive language, is not so easily done. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6574.804s">And</a>  there are reasons for blending and doing things a little bit differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6580.526s">We</a>  obviously are looking at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6582.428s">We're</a>  going to be waiting for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to give us the latest guidelines as they see them, and we haven't seen them yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6591.335s">We</a>  probably won't see them until either late spring or perhaps even into the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6596.079s">So,</a>  I doubt there's going to be much done in the next fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6601.884s">We</a>  are going to look at the blend of programs, and Paul is going to come up in a minute and talk about that, and how it comes together so that we can take advantage of the law where it's appropriate, while at the same time not lose track of situations which are best served by the current SEI. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6618.443s">Also,</a>  as you probably know, our teachers have <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6622.307s">We've</a>  been working to get SEI endorsements, which are required now, for teachers who work with students who have EL requirements, and the vast majority of faculty members do, especially in the core academic areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6635.377s">However,</a>  there's still some gaps, and there's still a need to continue pushing that as people receive students who have this English language need, to make sure that the teachers are fully prepared for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6650.189s">We</a>  also have the issue of dealing with the distribution of students with EL, and we're going to look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6656.572s">We</a>  did some distribution this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6658.753s">We'll</a>  have some comment about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6660.633s">It's</a>  not an easy subject, because as you move people around, you create, you solve one problem, you create another. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6666.506s">So</a>  we're going to provide some options for you in the beginning of the year, sometime in January, so you can look at what options are available to you and what it means financially and what it means programmatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6679.395s">But</a>  tonight, we want to give you an idea about the law, the pros, the cons of it, and some of the other things that Paul has put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6685.96s">So</a>  with permission, Paul, if you come on up and give us a discussion on this topic.</p>

    <p>[Paul Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6693.626s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6696.033s">So,</a>  this bill allows districts to choose what type of programming works best for their communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6704.3s">Unlike</a>  the old TBE, they had it set up where it was mandatory if you had 20 or more students who spoke in a language group. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6715.988s">During</a>  that time, students in their first year, it was 20% of instruction was in English, 80% was in the target language. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6724.312s">Year</a>  two, it was a 50-50 split. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6726.633s">And</a>  then year three, it was 20% in the native language and 80% in the target language. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6737.358s">We</a>  don't know what guidance the state's going to come out with regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6742.761s">We</a>  have to look at licensure because all of the bilingual licenses were put on hold by DESE 15 years ago when that ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6752.066s">So</a>  we don't know what their requirements will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6754.827s">We</a>  don't know <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6757.348s">really</a>  what their guidance will be with programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6760.809s">It</a>  doesn't, my understanding of it as the bill is written is it doesn't have to be a full-on program as it was in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6767.591s">We</a>  can now have just individual classes that can support our students who speak other languages. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6775.774s">So</a>  as Mr. Belson and I were talking about this initially, we're thinking, you know, start out when we look at our language groups, Portuguese is our highest, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6785.197s">highest</a>  number of speakers at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6788.938s">Our</a>  high school students are at a disadvantage because they have a finite period of time in which to learn language, pass all of their MCAS tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6796.079s">So</a>  if we were to introduce something here in Medford, we would look at those protocol, the protocol set out by the Department of Ed, look at our student population, which again, changes on a regular basis, and make those decisions at that time.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6814.955s">Esconia,</a>  I know that we really don't have a lot of questions to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6820.217s">You</a>  won't have the answers to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6821.958s">But</a>  I guess I don't know why this has never even come before. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6826.24s">But</a>  I'm going to ask you a question when students come to the place and they speak a different language. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6831.863s">They</a>  I know that we have specific classes to go into, but are they partnered with anybody in the high school themselves like like to go to lunch with or anything like that that already that are here in our system as students and speak both languages? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6846.953s">And</a>  the reason I said that is I don't know why it's never really hit me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6850.995s">But</a>  many years ago, going here, we had students that came in from Italy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6855.338s">I</a>  remember my teacher actually asking me, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6858.22s">to</a>  see if that student could, well, at that time our schedules were different, so that student had to come to all the classes I went to. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6864.985s">But</a>  at least to have someone that they could go to lunch with, introduce them to other people that maybe speak the language that they're here and in English. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6875.032s">And</a>  I don't, you know, I've never even asked that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6877.133s">I</a>  don't even know why.</p>

    <p>[Paul Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6878.321s">Well,</a>  when the students come here who don't speak English, they're set up with special, with their classes that are with an ESL teacher or a duly certified teacher who is certified in the content as well as ESL. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6893.146s">And</a>  those are our newcomer classrooms even here at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6897.087s">The</a>  teachers in collaboration with the building, with the assistant principals and guidance kind of have an informal protocol to set up students with other students, but it's not formalized, it's not a specific program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6912.356s">But</a>  the actual classes, the students are with all newcomers in these newcomer classrooms.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6918.459s">No,</a>  I understood that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6919.561s">I</a>  just didn't know if there was someone that they could hook them up with and, you know, at least show them, you know, to go to lunch with and maybe introduce it to their friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6926.732s">And,</a>  you know, that way, at least interpret for them, especially when they come into a new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6933.061s">I</a>  mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6933.782s">You</a>  know, you speak the language and you walk into a building or a new atmosphere and it's intimidating. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6938.705s">You</a>  know, to come in and not know the language is even worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6942.466s">So</a>  I was just thinking, like I said, years ago, my teachers just asked if we would take students along with us, at least at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6949.57s">Because</a>  it is very difficult to mandate someone to say, OK, you're going to be with that student every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6955.613s">but</a>  at least to merge them into lunch, and where are the bathrooms, and where is the cafeteria, and how do you go talk to the principal, and how do I get back into that classroom that I was supposed to go into?</p>

    <p>[Paul Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6965.721s">And</a>  like I said, that's done informally. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6967.542s">There's</a>  not a formal protocol or process for that, but the teachers work in collaboration with the guidance department on that.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6975.568s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6976.249s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6976.429s">Vandekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6977.61s">So</a>  Mr. Texer, are you thinking that we would pilot a program in Portuguese for next school year?</p>

    <p>[Paul Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6985.098s">I</a>  would wait until guidance comes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6987.139s">I'm</a>  actually going to a state meeting this Friday that will give me some additional information, and maybe I'll have a timeline on when the state will come out with their guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6999.363s">But</a>  I wouldn't move forward with anything until the guidance came forth.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7003.664s">Okay</a>  so and at Medford high school say for the Portuguese students level one and level two would be those students who were certainly level one would be the students who were just coming to us and level two they might have been with us for?</p>

    <p>[Paul Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7017.752s">Well</a>  those levels are based on what we do as a screener test when the students arrive it's based on <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7025.393s">WIDA</a>  testing, we're using the WIDA screener, and that gives us the level. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7031.756s">So</a>  students may have had English in their native country, which is why they would test as a level two, but they're still a newcomer, just arrival. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7040.16s">Other</a>  students that are level one most likely didn't have English in their native country.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7046.227s">The</a>  other question, which certainly is to be addressed to you, but a little bit different, is that we changed significantly this year when we split some programs between the Roberts and the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7059.811s">How</a>  is that working out?</p>

    <p>[Paul Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7064.354s">I'd</a>  have to, I mean, are you looking for something specific or?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7068.397s">Well,</a>  I was just curious, I think one of the concerns had to do with siblings and the ability of siblings to oversee their, you know, sisters and brothers.</p>

    <p>[Paul Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7078.025s">I</a>  know that the Parent Information Center has been struggling with trying to do the placement that best meets both children, and in some cases that hasn't actually happened.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7088.533s">Okay,</a>  so at some point I'd like to ask for a report on how that's worked out.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7094.442s">It's</a>  going to be tied into our discussion about options. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7097.603s">Okay,</a>  sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7098.904s">It's</a>  a larger picture and, you know, Paul and I have had some serious discussions about pros and cons of any kind of movement of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7106.487s">What</a>  it means for staff, what it means for transportation, what it means for siblings, what it means for, you know, language groupings. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7113.91s">This</a>  is a very complex issue and it requires a great deal of trade-off. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7119.232s">We</a>  have to decide what's the most important thing to us, what are the most important issues to us, and how we're going to solve them because there's no one perfect solution for any of this.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7128.756s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7129.636s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7129.936s">Stone,</a>  thank you for your report, both of you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7133.718s">The</a>  last paragraph on the report is if we were to move either program to the Andrews, there are at least 10 teachers who will need the SEI endorsement. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7145.042s">Organizations</a>  such as MatSol, Revis, Steam, I don't know any of them, will do training in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7150.505s">The</a>  cost is between $8,800 and $12,000 for anywhere from 25 to 30 participants. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7156.507s">So</a>  that's new to me, I didn't know that there was a separate training. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7159.449s">And</a>  is it, how long is the training?</p>

    <p>[Paul Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7162.23s">It's</a>  intense, it's a 40 hour course.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7165.489s">And</a>  so these companies, they'll all come to our city and would train the teachers who need this certification?</p>

    <p>[Paul Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7172.455s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7173.396s">And</a>  it's only certain providers can give it because this was governed under the Department of Justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7180.422s">So</a>  like Medford can't just offer their own training and say, okay, you're retail endorsed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7186.668s">It</a>  has to be through one of the state providers because the Department of Justice is still overseeing it.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7192.773s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7193.514s">At</a>  one time it should be noted that the courses were offered free, but that gate is now closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7199.942s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7200.542s">So</a>  now we have to, if we have openings for new people, if they're not coming out of colleges with the SEI enforcement, we have to actually offer it if they have students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7208.993s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7211.905s">Is</a>  there a motion to receive in place? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7213.707s">Is</a>  there a paper in place on file, ma'am? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7215.388s">By</a>  Mr. Skerry, seconded by Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7218.61s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7220.371s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7220.631s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7221.392s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7222.052s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Texerra. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7224.892s">Item</a>  5, recommendation to approve revised field trip policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7228.754s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7229.754s">So</a>  we're going to ask our deputy superintendent to tell us how we've responded to some of the issues that were raised recently.</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7245.082s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7246.883s">So</a>  at the Committee of the Whole meeting on November 13th, Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson gave an overview of the draft of the field trip policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7259.549s">It</a>  is important to know, I want to give credit where credit is due, that the substantive part of this policy really was developed by Tony Vento, Director of Health Services, and Gail Trainor, Assistant Principal at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7274.356s">So</a>  Beverly, Tony, Gail, and I reviewed this in light of the comments that the committee had on the 13th, and we made the following revisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7286.923s">There</a>  are five revisions that I will go over. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7290.485s">The</a>  first revision is that we added an accessibility statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7295.867s">So</a>  if you look on page one of the document, the bottom of page one, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7301.45s">In</a>  bold print, we added the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7304.271s">The</a>  Medford Public Schools is committed to ensuring that district field trips are accessible to all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7311.215s">The</a>  policy adheres to all requirements set forth in both Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, also known as ADA of 1990. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7322.08s">So</a>  we addressed that concern with that statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7328.043s">The</a>  second concern that we addressed <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7332.331s">is</a>  has to do with the definition of a chaperone, and a chaperone includes any adult who is vested or non-vested with monitoring student safety so if you look on page two of your document <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7348.404s">The</a>  second half of the page, next to where it says chaperones, I will read that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7352.766s">So</a>  the wording now is the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7354.987s">Chaperone</a>  is any employee of the Metro Public Schools or parent slash guardian or any adult that attends a trip and is vested or non-vested with the responsibility of monitoring student safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7369.724s">does</a>  not say a criminal offender record information or a quarry check of all chaperones must be on file in the superintendent's office at least seven days prior to the date of the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7378.576s">All</a>  right, so that addresses that second concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7384.078s">The</a>  third concern has to do with in emergency situations, the school committee will be added to the list of entities that will be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7394.449s">So</a>  if you look on page three of the document, under letter J, Roman numeral three, lowercase Roman numeral three, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7405.648s">you</a>  will see that members of the school committee have added. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7408.569s">So</a>  I'll read all of J. Should an emergency situation occur, the sponsoring faculty member is responsible for notifying, to the best of their ability, by telephone, text, or email, as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after the emergency situation occurs, the following individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7429.175s">The</a>  superintendent, headmaster, and principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7432.864s">the</a>  parent slash guardian of record, and again, number three, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7439.869s">So</a>  we believe that addresses that third concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7444.472s">Going</a>  on to the fourth concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7447.674s">So</a>  the fourth concern has to do with the term counseling services. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7450.996s">We've</a>  broadened that to support services. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7453.898s">So</a>  if you look in the document on page five, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7458.281s">On</a>  page five you have, let's see, it's section four approval documentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7462.002s">If</a>  you go down to letter D, again on page five, letter D, it says the cost per student, if applicable, including the provision for nursing or support services. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7475.668s">So</a>  again, we change counseling to support services if necessary, as well as travel insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7481.95s">So</a>  we believe that addresses that concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7485.534s">And</a>  then lastly, the fifth concern that was expressed on the night of the 13th has to do with affirming, creating an affirmation statement that all field trip related forms will be posted to the school's website. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7501.225s">So</a>  if you look on page nine of the document, it's the very last item, it's a letter D, and it now says all field trip related forms will be posted to the district website.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7514.2s">uh...</a>  i'm happy to take any any questions uh... thank you bernadette so of the uh... corrections and changes that you've made i've noted that all the ones that i particularly had brought up the taking care of that of course now being said is my eyes lit on another uh... <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7534.369s">which</a>  I think we need to amend. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7537.271s">So</a>  if you give me a second so I can find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7540.472s">It</a>  has to do with the notification for approval or disapproval of the field trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7546.474s">And</a>  it is on page four, section three B. It reads right now, all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote by the Medford School Committee six months prior to the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7563.064s">And</a>  I have to say, I know that that's totally unrealistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7566.105s">I</a>  think that when we're thinking about it, we're thinking about all-schools concert trips, which involve overnight out-of-country travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7574.389s">So</a>  that would be when the kids are going off to Spain or Italy or whatever, that that time frame of six months is what we would be expecting or looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7585.417s">But</a>  we all know that there have been other overnight trips, even including, you know, the SkillsUSA program is an overnight trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7595.74s">We've</a>  had kids go to the Ethics Bowl was an overnight trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7599.161s">Those</a>  things, there was no time to give six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7602.022s">It's</a>  not realistic to have our policy say six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7606.464s">So</a>  I think we need a sentence which say, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7610.665s">For</a>  other field trips, you know, for other overnight trips, the school committee will be brought to the school committee for their approval.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7624.148s">Using</a>  discretion.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7625.649s">Using</a>  as timely, you know, I mean, it depends on the timeframe.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7628.449s">Prior</a>  to the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7629.569s">Prior</a>  discretion to the trip.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7631.63s">Yeah,</a>  prior to the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7633.17s">But</a>  I mean, it has to be reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7634.731s">We</a>  really don't like the last minute ones that, I mean, there's a last minute one because there's an opportunity that's last minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7640.692s">And</a>  there's a last minute one because nobody got around to telling us.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7661.144s">The</a>  only question I have about that is that sometimes depending on our schedule if something comes up quickly and a deposit has to be put in to hold it and we don't meet <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7675.671s">until</a>  after the deadline.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7677.392s">Well,</a>  there is a clause which allows the superintendent to approve a trip if we don't have a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7683.835s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Sebastian Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7684.296s">So</a>  that's covered in that.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7685.776s">But</a>  again, I think the first sentence needs to say overnight out of country. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7690.879s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7692.26s">Travel.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7692.94s">And</a>  then the second sentence need to say other, I'm just trying to think. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7699.083s">Other</a>  trips involving overnight travel must be approved by the school committee within an appropriate time frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7710.757s">I</a>  think we're gonna need to leave it a little bit unclear. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7715.782s">Unless</a>  someone else has a better wording.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7718.405s">Well,</a>  I had a, because the wording is already in here, it seems like, under E. I wouldn't distinguish between out of country or in, just private payment means, before they book it, they have to get approval from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7736.215s">And</a>  then if there's an extreme emergency, or it comes up really short notice, like the bulls came up very short notice, then that's different.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7745.06s">And</a>  that's addressed like at an E.</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7749.698s">So</a>  prior to payment.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7752.06s">So</a>  you're saying all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote of the Medford School Committee prior to payment.</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7767.154s">Prior</a>  to payment, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7770.218s">I</a>  will add that, change that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7772.399s">Are</a>  there any other suggestions at this point? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7775.781s">Nope,</a>  that's good.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7778.822s">Motion</a>  to approve.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7779.523s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7780.303s">I</a>  just had one note too.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7782.004s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7783.484s">First</a>  of all, thank you for making all the changes I brought forward at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7790.203s">I'm</a>  just hoping that that statement about the method of public schools is committed to ensuring that the district field trips are accessible to all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7800.729s">The</a>  policy adheres to all requirements set forth by both section 504, Rehabilitation Act and American Disability Act meets the needs that were brought up by other people at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7814.316s">I</a>  think it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7815.217s">I</a>  think it's fair and appropriate.</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7817.738s">So</a>  what I will say is that I did do research. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7820.501s">I</a>  looked at a lot of other district policy statements. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7825.506s">I</a>  looked at a lot of federal law, and I thought this encompassed it in a broad way, in a succinct way. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7835.275s">There</a>  are volumes and volumes of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7837.857s">There's</a>  obviously lots of case law. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7840.098s">I</a>  try to be succinct. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7841.819s">I'm</a>  certainly willing to be open, but I did research on it.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7854.226s">does</a>  meet that need, and thank you for adding that in, as well as making the changes I brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7860.689s">The</a>  only other thing I have is I was hoping to see an example of the form that teachers and staff would meet, and I wanted to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7870.352s">make</a>  sure that it's on the online, so it goes from one person, gets signed off by the nurses, then goes to the administration, and then finally signed off by the superintendent in electronic format. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7882.598s">So</a>  I would like to see and approve that form. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7885.9s">And</a>  also an example of the medication administration slash delegation form that the district uses, I'd like to see that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7894.424s">So</a>  it's here all in one shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7896.525s">So</a>  if parents ever want to see what's the policy, they have the sample forms, they have everything right here, part of this packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7904.009s">So</a>  I'm asking that this be revised and brought to us with those in tact, because that was what was requested at our last meeting for my notes.</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7913.693s">Can</a>  I ask a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7916.594s">So</a>  we do have forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7918.755s">There's</a>  probably 12, maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7920.495s">I</a>  think there are about 12 forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7922.236s">They</a>  are still in development. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7924.316s">I</a>  know that, again, Tony Vento and Gail Traynor have been working on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7928.037s">They're</a>  very close to being finalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7930.218s">But</a>  it's not just one or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7931.938s">There</a>  are a lot of forms, and we're trying to make them so that they're visually easy to understand, yet substantive at the same time.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7940.647s">So</a>  I'm asking to table this until we have the completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7943.71s">Well,</a>  we've asked for an amendment as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7945.492s">So</a>  when you bring back the amendment.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7948.215s">May</a>  I ask one question? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7948.975s">You</a>  have the samples ready? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7950.397s">Is</a>  there any concern about tabling this piece of it at this point? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7955.722s">Is</a>  it gonna hold anything up in terms of? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7958.905s">We</a>  have an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7959.666s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7961.738s">I</a>  don't think it's gonna hold anything up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7963.039s">You</a>  know the basic premise of the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7965.581s">Right,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7966.261s">I</a>  think if we allow us to just move forward, you know, and the formalization will take place when we get back.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7971.245s">Okay,</a>  so you want a motion to approve subject to the amendment that we just drafted?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7976.568s">Well,</a>  Erin, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7979.67s">No,</a>  Erin wants to, what I was just asking was for clarification, because Erin wants to table it at right now and hold it until we have all of it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7988.236s">I</a>  just asked whether there was any problem with that.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7990.618s">Well,</a>  I guess, you know, we're gonna have some field trips that are gonna show up in the next little while, and if it takes a little bit longer to get everything clear, we'll be operating under some old rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8000.504s">It</a>  might be useful to just simply say that in the main, this is an acceptable piece, understanding the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8006.188s">I</a>  mean, and that we provide the forms at the earliest possible time in January.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8012.495s">Mayor,</a>  I would second the field trip policy we accepted tonight with inclusion of amendments to the latest date.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8023.085s">Forms.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8023.666s">Your</a>  forms, yes.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8025.632s">and</a>  we'll provide them to you, but at least you'll have something that's, you know.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8028.275s">At</a>  least we have a policy in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8030.998s">The</a>  forms need to be approved, I want them district wide, there's specific things, so it's hard to approve something based on, without having everything at one point. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8041.03s">I</a>  do like, everything is in here that we need in here, but I, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8047.661s">How</a>  long would it take to get the forms to us and be presented? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8051.322s">I</a>  mean, we have a lot of meetings coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8053.263s">I</a>  mean, they have to be K-12 forms.</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8058.484s">They</a>  are created. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8059.945s">I</a>  think that they might need a little bit more tweaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8062.306s">We</a>  have been working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8063.706s">Perhaps</a>  Beverly has something to add to that.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8067.384s">The</a>  forms were done, they just aren't organized. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8069.927s">When</a>  we got the forms, they were so voluminous that they were just very hard for people to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8075.973s">So</a>  I know, Tony, we've been working at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8077.914s">We</a>  just, it will take more time to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8080.917s">The</a>  forms should not change anything in the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8084.441s">And,</a>  again, I'm a little concerned about dragging this out because people are looking for guidance, the administration, the principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8091.268s">We</a>  have a meeting tomorrow with principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8093.07s">We'd</a>  like to be able to say we have a policy guide so that we don't keep going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8098.335s">The</a>  forms, again, it's an organizational piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8101.418s">It's</a>  trying to make them customer-friendly, and it should not really <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8106.651s">be</a>  anything.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8107.734s">Can</a>  we have those forms by the 18th to satisfy the needs of this board?</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8118.002s">I</a>  think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8118.702s">Tony,</a>  you said we've been revising. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8120.823s">We've</a>  been working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8122.023s">We</a>  just don't have it perfect, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8126.044s">In</a>  terms of there are medical forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8127.684s">OK,</a>  it's kind of a cascading effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8131.545s">There's</a>  the preliminary forms that everybody's going to have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8134.566s">And</a>  then what comes into play is another set of forms for children that have medical issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8140.207s">So</a>  we need to make it so that people understand they don't have to fill out 20 forms when <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8145.848s">It</a>  doesn't apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8146.548s">And</a>  so that's what we're struggling with now, trying to make this concise, make it applicable to the particular trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8154.831s">And</a>  we don't want, because we know what happens when you put a whole bunch of papers out, people just look at it and say, I can't do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8160.533s">You</a>  know, it's just too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8161.753s">So</a>  we're trying to make it customer friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8164.294s">But</a>  again, the policy, the form should really not, I mean, we can get them to you, but I'd like to move forward with this if we could.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8176.392s">So</a>  the form I'm looking at is is the application to go on the field trip Not so much all the forms that all parents have to do but even the application form like okay I want to take my second grade class to Apple picking at you know <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8195.231s">And</a>  so I'm going to go online, I'm going to fill this out, it's going to go to the nurse and it's going to go to my head, you know, my principal and the superintendent for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8208.975s">That's</a>  the type of form I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8210.257s">From</a>  the teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8211.218s">From</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8212.019s">And</a>  I want it tracked, so I want to know, I want data next year saying, this is where they went. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8218.086s">This</a>  grade over here went on five field trips, whereas this school over here hasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8223.992s">And</a>  maybe as a district, we might want to help them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8227.977s">you</a>  know, I want that data. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8229.619s">So</a>  that's the form that I, I don't need every single form at this point, but I want, when you roll this out, hey, here's our new thing, and this is how you apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8239.251s">I</a>  want it to go with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8240.893s">If</a>  you just do that one.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8243.456s">And</a>  I think, too, Erin, you may have mentioned last time at the meeting a checklist of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8249.661s">I</a>  think we added one thing to the checklist. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8251.462s">So</a>  we have the checklist. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8253.184s">We</a>  have the preliminary form. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8255.145s">It's</a>  just that we really want to make everything else, and it can be a lot of forms, depending upon the youngsters who are going on the trip, something that people aren't going to look at and say, I'm not going to go on the trip because I don't want to fill out the forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8267.854s">That</a>  would be the last thing we want to do on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8270.711s">We</a>  can do the checklist and we can do just the preliminary application.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8277.197s">A</a>  clarification on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8278.618s">Motion.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8279.058s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8283.682s">There</a>  is, I mean, I know that there's a large group that have computers, but there's also a large group out there that doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8290.887s">And</a>  so I just want to make sure, you know, not everything translates from on-site to actually hot copy as easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8300.274s">So</a>  when we're doing this online, are we doing them in different languages?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8304.778s">This</a>  is just for teachers.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8308.765s">Okay,</a>  that's where the clarification is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8310.446s">You're</a>  not talking about the parent filling it out, you're actually just talking about the teacher filling it out.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8316.187s">There</a>  will be a parent permission form that will be part of the package, but I think at this point we're talking about what's the checklist. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8325.23s">Most</a>  of this, a lot of this has stemmed from the fact that teachers would begin to plan trips, begin to fundraise, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8333.908s">begin</a>  to get kids excited without the principal knowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8337.913s">And</a>  then there were all kinds of repercussions after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8340.296s">So</a>  this was really initially an attempt to make sure that before people start the process, they know what the process has to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8347.826s">And</a>  so that was where this was originated from.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8354.153s">It's</a>  two separate ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8355.214s">One's</a>  a motion to accept the policy with the one amendment that was made a little earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8361.262s">And</a>  then Erin asked that the whole policy not be accepted until we have the forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8366.408s">She's</a>  now specified it's the start form. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8369.772s">But</a>  to me the policy <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8372.295s">dictates</a>  and the forms can come and they can be changed as things change in life. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8378.24s">So</a>  I would ask that we approve the policy so that we can get it out to the principals, especially at your meeting tomorrow, and then we can get the forms at our next meeting or the meeting after.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8388.808s">We</a>  can get those two forms to you next time, but we won't have the opportunity to meet with the principals again until January. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8394.913s">So</a>  if we had this to them tomorrow, it would be helpful.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8397.675s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8397.855s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8398.996s">Oh,</a>  I had a similar question about the forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8402.298s">I</a>  just wanted to know, are the forms gonna be available to the teachers with the Google Doc documents, where they can go in and add their information directly onto it and then move it along? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8413.484s">Because</a>  I think that was discussed at the last meeting.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8416.185s">Yes,</a>  it was At the committee of the whole about the field trip there was a number of parents from the CPAC organization Did you reach out to them to ask them if this was I don't they spoke about the language? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8428.797s">They</a>  were looking for that made them feel confident that we were being equitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8432.94s">So</a>  is that possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8433.981s">I</a>  think the chairperson said could you reach out to me with language I could help you with language and</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8438.961s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8439.222s">We</a>  basically, as Bernadette said, she did the research, but we also worked with Kathy Medaglia, who looked at this for me and thought that this would be something that would cover all of those instances. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8449.68s">So</a>  we feel that it does.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8453.262s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8454.382s">Vanden</a>  Heuvel. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8455.083s">So</a>  you're gonna kill me, but I'm going back to this line about approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8461.425s">And</a>  you just said something, you said that what happened in the past is that teachers started advertising to the kids that they were gonna go on this, and they got everybody all excited, and they might even start raising money, and that has nothing to do with payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8478.23s">So</a>  if we're saying that when we want to approve the trip, if you're waiting, saying, well, we only need to approve it with payment, that means that teacher can already be advertising it and they can be raising money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8492.061s">Payment</a>  is not the word that you want there.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8495.504s">So</a>  we're dealing with which, come on back.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8497.706s">So</a>  this is page four, number three.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8501.248s">Let's</a>  just see.</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8504.995s">So,</a>  it's, yes, right here.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8508.618s">All</a>  school-sponsored trips involve overnight, out-of-state travel, must receive prior approval.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8515.684s">They</a>  need to figure out if people are even interested in going. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8518.246s">They</a>  have to poll their students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8521.829s">If</a>  no one wants to go, they're not going to come to us and ask for approval.</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8527.554s">So</a>  what you're saying is that it should not be prior to payment, that we need to take that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8535.378s">Moments</a>  ago you suggested that we add that in prior to payment.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8538.86s">I</a>  didn't suggest payment, someone else did. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8540.32s">I</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8540.941s">Okay,</a>  and I suggested that what we were doing was saying that teacher was going out of the country, the school committee wanted six months notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8550.626s">I</a>  think if there's an overnight trip, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8555.548s">within</a>  the United States that we want two months notice, maybe three months notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8561.451s">Okay,</a>  I'm saying, and then I'm putting in a clause and saying, if an opportunity arises for students that is, you know, underneath this timeframe, that approval can be given by the superintendent with notification to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8578.832s">I</a>  mean, that's that's how I would line it out now, because payment, I think, is I think payment is arbitrary.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8584.436s">And</a>  there are some trips that we're not going to require payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8586.657s">Some</a>  of the out of right.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8588.218s">So</a>  just recently, we had the Italian. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8591.14s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8591.62s">Come</a>  to New York opportunities to go to New York.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8594.162s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8594.662s">Well,</a>  that was being funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8595.803s">I</a>  mean, someone else.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8597.064s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8597.744s">So</a>  it may be in a timely way. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8599.625s">Overnight</a>  trips, other overnight trips must be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8603.307s">approved</a>  in a timely way, because we do have things that happen very quickly, like that New York trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8608.652s">Others</a>  we have several months doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8610.593s">So</a>  if we just put it in a timely way and we leave it kind of discretionary.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8616.112s">I</a>  think you need to be careful not to overregulate because what happens is the circumstances change, situations change. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8622.696s">What</a>  you're really saying to us, be responsible, be reasonable, keep us informed, make things, you know, don't let people go run amok and go too far down the road before, you know, you know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8633.063s">Because</a>  that's really what we're basically saying to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8635.284s">And</a>  I think, you know, we've got professionals on staff, they've got to understand that that means give us the information in a timely way. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8641.568s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, do I dare remind you that just last week we were approving a field trip.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8647.43s">We</a>  had a new administrator.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8650.432s">We</a>  also had a full month where we didn't hold a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8653.853s">And</a>  that's really, you know, that was really a circumstantial thing, but that's eight.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8657.335s">So</a>  let me just ask the committee, if we're talking about foreign trips out of country to Italy, to Honduras, wherever it is, how much time does the committee want to know in advance to approve that?</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8669.36s">90</a>  days.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8672.103s">90</a>  days, here it said six months.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8674.745s">We</a>  usually bring those to you pretty early, you know, almost like a year.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8679.789s">I</a>  just don't want to be in a situation where there might be an opportunity for our students to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8689.596s">And</a>  then because the teacher then looks down and looks at the policy and says, oh, geez, it wasn't within the two weeks or it wasn't within the three weeks or seven months. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8699.504s">What</a>  if they don't even bring it?</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8701.185s">What</a>  if we kept it six months unless there are extenuating circumstances?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8705.531s">That's</a>  fine.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8706.913s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8708.054s">Discretionary.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8711.038s">Six</a>  months unless there are extenuating circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8715.34s">That</a>  leaves some flexibility.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8717.1s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8717.401s">So</a>  I think you should do three months, because I think... Wait, the six months was for foreign travel, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8725.043s">If</a>  you're saying just a general blanket, and the kids are going to Cape Cod, we're not asking for six months time.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8733.365s">No,</a>  the overnight in domestic trips, I thought we said would be in a timely way, because those are going to pop up quickly, or they may be longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8745.212s">I</a>  think those would be in a timely way. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8746.894s">The</a>  six months, I think, for the international, I think is reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8751.578s">Most</a>  of those trips are planned a year in advance, for the most part.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8755.301s">All</a>  right, that's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8756.743s">So</a>  as amended now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8758.404s">Motion</a>  for approval of the policy as amended on the floor, seconded by Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8764.49s">Roll</a>  call vote, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8766.371s">Mrs.</a>  Cugno.</p>
