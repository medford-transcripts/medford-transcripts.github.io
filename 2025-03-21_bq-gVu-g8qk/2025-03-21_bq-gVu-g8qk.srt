Congratulations.

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,341
[SPEAKER_18]: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

51
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:58,445
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. President, I'd like to move suspension of the rules for item 15-616 and also the paper in relative to the Garden Club Commission.

52
00:04:59,125 --> 00:04:59,525
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

53
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:03,246
[SPEAKER_18]: So under the motion for suspension of the rules under Councilor Camuso, all those in favor?

54
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:04,447
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

55
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:06,848
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion carries.

56
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:11,009
[SPEAKER_18]: 15-016 to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass.

57
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:12,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Dear Mr. President and Councilors,

00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:27,764
[SPEAKER_18]: I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body confirm the appointment of Losa Julie Janvier of 63 Rockwell Avenue, Medford, as a member of the Medford Housing Authority for a term to expire April 8, 2020.

59
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:30,285
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

60
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:36,226
[SPEAKER_18]: Janvier, who will serve as the tenant representative, is present this evening.

61
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:39,367
[SPEAKER_18]: This position has become available as Ms.

62
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:42,828
[SPEAKER_18]: Heather Merchant has moved out of the city

63
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:45,593
[SPEAKER_18]: very truly yours, Michael J. McGlynn, et cetera.

64
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:50,734
[SPEAKER_18]: The mayor sent this along in the agenda over the weekend.

65
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:59,196
[SPEAKER_18]: And we also received Mr. Genevieve's resume in our packets over the weekend.

66
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:02,557
[SPEAKER_18]: So go ahead, Councilman.

67
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:03,998
[SPEAKER_32]: Move approval on the appointment.

68
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:12,180
[SPEAKER_32]: And if we could do two papers after this that are relative to the Medford Housing Authority under suspension

69
00:06:12,843 --> 00:06:15,846
[SPEAKER_32]: while the representative is here.

70
00:06:16,406 --> 00:06:16,827
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

71
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:26,315
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion of approval, uh, Councilor Penta, um, Mr. Rumley, can you answer a question please?

72
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,921
[SPEAKER_09]: The city saloon sitter approaches the podium.

73
00:06:34,182 --> 00:06:34,822
[SPEAKER_09]: I was looking at you.

74
00:06:34,842 --> 00:06:35,963
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't get the words out of my mouth.

75
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:37,184
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm saying, I apologize.

76
00:06:37,204 --> 00:06:37,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

77
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,013
[SPEAKER_09]: This young lady that's being appointed now, that's a mayoral appointment, correct?

78
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:44,334
[SPEAKER_09]: It is, Councilor.

79
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:46,115
[SPEAKER_09]: And how long has the vacancy been there?

80
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:48,057
[SPEAKER_24]: I really don't know.

81
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:50,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anybody know how long the vacancy has been?

82
00:06:50,158 --> 00:06:54,722
[SPEAKER_24]: I certainly think it's been one full year.

83
00:06:55,022 --> 00:06:55,563
[SPEAKER_09]: One full year.

84
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,825
[SPEAKER_24]: At least that's to my knowledge, because I don't recall any appointment in the last year.

85
00:07:00,006 --> 00:07:08,793
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, Mr. Solicitor, I know it's not your call, but during this past year, there have been concerns from tenants

86
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:11,054
[SPEAKER_09]: that there was no tenant representative.

87
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:21,196
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would hope the young lady becomes very cognizant of all the concerns, whether you agree or disagree, to bring them forward to the board, because there hasn't been anyone there for a year.

88
00:07:21,957 --> 00:07:23,857
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's really what's needed.

89
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,177
[SPEAKER_09]: You need representation.

90
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:26,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

91
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:26,798
[SPEAKER_24]: Very well.

92
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:27,238
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

93
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:33,219
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Patu, is all set?

94
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:33,479
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep.

95
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:35,259
[SPEAKER_18]: Roll call vote.

96
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:38,300
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion of approval by Councilor Camuso,

97
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:40,853
[SPEAKER_18]: A roll call vote has been requested.

98
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:42,274
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

99
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:44,775
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

100
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:46,236
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

101
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:49,778
Yes.

102
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:51,799
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

103
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:53,019
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

104
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:54,960
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

105
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,401
[SPEAKER_18]: With the vote of 70 affirmative, none negative.

106
00:07:58,122 --> 00:08:01,864
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, we, uh, can we take the two regarding method?

107
00:08:01,904 --> 00:08:02,124
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

108
00:08:03,585 --> 00:08:05,005
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion has been approved.

109
00:08:05,405 --> 00:08:06,346
[SPEAKER_18]: Congratulations.

110
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:08,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for your service.

111
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,421
[SPEAKER_18]: Can she actually just stick around, if we could ask her to stick around?

112
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:13,702
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you would, because we have two papers before us.

113
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:19,305
[SPEAKER_18]: They're both offered under suspension, one by Councilor Camuso, one offered by Councilor Caraviello.

114
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:33,951
[SPEAKER_18]: They're both the same, I believe, so be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss the current problems at Tamponi Manor, and by Councilor Camuso, be it resolved that the conditions at the Medford Housing Authority be discussed.

115
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:36,092
[SPEAKER_18]: So if Councilor Camuso, you'd like to start.

116
00:08:36,352 --> 00:08:37,313
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Mr. President.

117
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,809
[SPEAKER_32]: First of all, congratulations on your appointment.

118
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:47,933
[SPEAKER_32]: This is the most important appointment, I think, on that board, because it brings a perspective from the tenants.

119
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:56,617
[SPEAKER_32]: We often hear complaints, but I've been getting a considerable amount of more complaints recently, just to name a few.

120
00:08:57,098 --> 00:09:00,699
[SPEAKER_32]: Tempone Manor recently just had a pretty nasty assault down there.

121
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:04,481
[SPEAKER_32]: There's the ongoing drug problems in the building.

122
00:09:06,494 --> 00:09:11,761
[SPEAKER_32]: There's people drinking out on the steps of Canal Street when people are traversing the neighborhood, and this is public housing.

123
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:16,887
[SPEAKER_32]: Willis Ave, all you have to do is pick up the police blotter each week.

124
00:09:17,617 --> 00:09:21,918
[SPEAKER_32]: and see some of the problems that are ongoing down there and walk on court as well.

125
00:09:22,618 --> 00:09:24,998
[SPEAKER_32]: These are quality of life issues, Mr. President.

126
00:09:25,658 --> 00:09:36,620
[SPEAKER_32]: Quality of life issues that will affect the senior citizens down here at our high rises in Medford Square, as well as Bradley Road and all the other units that are under the authority and jurisdiction of the Medford Housing Authority.

127
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:46,082
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that the leadership, as far as the executive director and the board, have to really get involved with this.

128
00:09:46,706 --> 00:09:48,467
[SPEAKER_32]: and get their hands around this.

129
00:09:50,148 --> 00:10:02,295
[SPEAKER_32]: Not to get too much into specifics, but one of the situations with a recent assault, another assault took place with the same people a year or two ago, and they're still living there.

130
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,763
[SPEAKER_32]: These are our senior citizens and our residents that deserve a better quality of life.

131
00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:17,249
[SPEAKER_32]: So if we could just ask the Executive Director to issue a report to us on what he's doing to clean up these housing developments, it would be greatly appreciated.

132
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,050
[SPEAKER_32]: Very good.

133
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:28,137
[SPEAKER_18]: So on the motion of Councilor Tommaso that the Director of Medford Housing Authority report back to the Council regarding the aforementioned incidents.

134
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:29,358
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Caraviello.

135
00:10:29,678 --> 00:10:30,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

136
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I concur with my colleague here.

137
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:48,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been hearing the complaints coming, but also on top of what Councilor Camuso had mentioned, there's many complaints about dogs, multiple dogs, pit bulls being brought into these apartments where people are literally afraid to walk out the door anymore.

138
00:10:49,678 --> 00:10:53,640
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's also four and five families living in one unit.

139
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,403
[SPEAKER_05]: They're coming in, there's abandoned cars being left on these properties where they're dealing drugs right out of the car.

140
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:08,443
[SPEAKER_05]: the seniors that live there deserve a better life than what they're getting right now.

141
00:11:09,104 --> 00:11:20,230
[SPEAKER_05]: And I second councilor Camuso's request to have this sent to the Medford housing authority, even though we have no authority over them.

142
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,271
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's something they should be made aware of.

143
00:11:23,472 --> 00:11:25,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope that gets done tonight, Mr. President.

144
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:33,680
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

145
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:39,903
[SPEAKER_25]: I, too, have received the same complaints and concerns and want to thank my two colleagues for bringing this up tonight.

146
00:11:41,163 --> 00:11:54,029
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's great that we get a correspondence back from the Director of Medford Housing, but I think it's only appropriate with the seriousness of these particular complaints that the Housing Director appear before the Medford City Council.

147
00:11:54,510 --> 00:12:01,693
[SPEAKER_25]: If you choose executive session, that'd be fine with me or here at the council meeting.

148
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:04,845
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's only appropriate that he appear before us, Mr. President.

149
00:12:05,546 --> 00:12:14,674
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe if I could suggest I'll call the Committee of the Whole to address this so that we can sit and maybe have more collegial conversation about this.

150
00:12:14,954 --> 00:12:15,875
[SPEAKER_25]: That's perfect.

151
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:18,277
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Caraviello.

152
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:25,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, there is a meeting over there at the Housing Authority tomorrow night, and I know this is also on their agenda.

153
00:12:26,064 --> 00:12:26,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

154
00:12:26,564 --> 00:12:28,986
[SPEAKER_05]: So anybody who wants to go over there can maybe attend over there also.

155
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,501
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Camuso, all those in favor?

156
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:34,301
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

157
00:12:34,882 --> 00:12:37,883
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion is carried.

158
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:37,883
15, 518.

159
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:48,346
[SPEAKER_18]: To President De La Ruzo and members of the Honorable Medford City Council, from Mayor Michael J. McGlynn, reestablishment of the Medford Community Garden Commission.

160
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:59,630
[SPEAKER_18]: Dear Mr. President and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approve the following amendment to the revised ordinances of the City of Medford.

161
00:13:00,188 --> 00:13:06,850
[SPEAKER_18]: Your approval of this amendment will provide for the establishment of a community garden commission in the city of Medford.

162
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:11,572
[SPEAKER_18]: The following is a full text of the proposed amendment.

163
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:19,155
[SPEAKER_13]: I will read it now being of the full text of the amendment and recommend a brief synopsis thereof.

164
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:20,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

165
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:27,938
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, on the motion of Councilor Knight, I will forego the reading of the three and a half pages of the, uh,

166
00:13:28,815 --> 00:13:42,123
[SPEAKER_18]: of the proposed ordinance and kindly request that the city solicitor, who was here present tonight, give the council a brief synopsis and overview of what is before us.

167
00:13:42,563 --> 00:13:44,224
[SPEAKER_18]: Welcome again, Mr. Solicitor.

168
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:46,185
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

169
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:54,631
[SPEAKER_24]: The ordinance which is before you tonight is the result of the work of many people, least of which was me.

170
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:57,032
[SPEAKER_24]: I did a little bit of polishing on the language,

171
00:13:57,908 --> 00:14:02,591
[SPEAKER_24]: But there have been others involved in this much more than I, and I don't have all of their names.

172
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:07,955
[SPEAKER_24]: I wish I did, but certainly Alicia Hunt and Saira McGiven here at City Hall.

173
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,176
[SPEAKER_24]: And I also work with Michael Lambert.

174
00:14:10,276 --> 00:14:13,498
[SPEAKER_24]: And there's a lot of names I'm leaving out, so I hope they forgive me.

175
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:18,401
[SPEAKER_24]: But this ordinance deals with a community garden commission.

176
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:24,785
[SPEAKER_24]: There is one amendment I'm going to propose at the end of my explanation, and I'll try to make the explanation brief.

177
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,447
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll go through it section at a time.

178
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:36,370
[SPEAKER_24]: Obviously, the be it ordained is a preamble, which is just a short precis as to where this would fit in in the ordinances.

179
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:44,832
[SPEAKER_24]: And by the way, the division and section numbers, I went over with Mr. Finn before I put it on the council agenda, so that's where those numbers came from.

180
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:51,894
[SPEAKER_24]: In the first section, it's the establishment, which names it as the Community Garden Commission.

181
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:57,235
[SPEAKER_24]: The function is to organize, coordinate, set policies, and have oversight.

182
00:14:57,882 --> 00:15:05,627
[SPEAKER_24]: community gardens now established or to be established on property owned, controlled or managed by the city of Medford.

183
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:11,492
[SPEAKER_24]: I ask that you hold that thought till the end because I'm going to suggest an amendment to that second provision.

184
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:13,653
[SPEAKER_24]: Next it's jurisdiction.

185
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:26,102
[SPEAKER_24]: The jurisdiction would be to consider and to approve the amount of fees to be charged for people participating in the community gardens and to provide general oversight on the plots and to make regulations, et cetera.

186
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:32,697
[SPEAKER_24]: The next section deals with members and terms, and I know I'm going a little quick, so if you want me to slow down, just let me know.

187
00:15:33,678 --> 00:15:41,780
[SPEAKER_24]: Five members, there'd be five regular members of the commission, two alternates, and at least one representative from various community gardens.

188
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:49,982
[SPEAKER_24]: The initial terms would be staggered in one, two, and three-year terms, so as to make a changeover on every anniversary.

189
00:15:52,837 --> 00:16:05,805
[SPEAKER_24]: Then if there are additional gardens established, section C of this section allows for additional commissioners and or alternates to be appointed by the mayor in the same manner as original appointments.

190
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:14,110
[SPEAKER_24]: And the last part of that, section D, it says that if a member is absent, then their place can be taken by an alternate member.

191
00:16:14,831 --> 00:16:21,455
[SPEAKER_24]: And in a case where there is repeated absences or an inability or unwillingness to participate,

192
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:33,252
[SPEAKER_24]: The chairperson of the commission can make a recommendation to the mayor that the person's appointment be terminated, and then the mayor can appoint in a similar fashion to the original appointments.

193
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:42,580
[SPEAKER_24]: The organization of the commission would be to have a chairman, a vice chairman, chosen from among its membership in its first meeting in November each year.

194
00:16:44,362 --> 00:16:49,366
[SPEAKER_24]: And the vice chairman can sit in the position of the chairman if that's necessary.

195
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:58,899
[SPEAKER_24]: And a majority of the members would have the ability to call emergency meetings, but of course there must always be compliance with the open meeting laws.

196
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:09,601
[SPEAKER_24]: Next, the commission would have the ability to, after public notice and after public hearing, to make rules and regulations pertaining to community gardens.

197
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:15,142
[SPEAKER_24]: And these of course would be filed with the city clerk in the city of Medford.

198
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:19,223
[SPEAKER_24]: They could also set fees.

199
00:17:20,512 --> 00:17:27,417
[SPEAKER_24]: and to make regulations which are consistent with their purpose and also set the amount and purpose of fees.

200
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:38,204
[SPEAKER_24]: Next, the application of the fees would be to cover the reasonable and necessary garden expenses which pertain to the community gardens.

201
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:46,549
[SPEAKER_24]: So they just couldn't be set in an arbitrary fashion, but would have to have some nexus to actual expenses

202
00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:48,096
[SPEAKER_24]: and to costs.

203
00:17:48,877 --> 00:17:55,039
[SPEAKER_24]: And of course they can accept recommendations from the participants in the gardens as to the fees, et cetera.

204
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:58,460
[SPEAKER_24]: And they have to be equitable and fair to all garden members.

205
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:11,505
[SPEAKER_24]: Finally, the commission should compile or shall compile an annual report of their activities and submit that report to the mayor and the Medford city council at the end of each calendar year.

206
00:18:12,245 --> 00:18:14,106
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's generally the outline.

207
00:18:14,502 --> 00:18:17,544
[SPEAKER_24]: of that particular ordinance, skipping a lot of words to save time.

208
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:21,047
[SPEAKER_24]: And there is one amendment I would suggest.

209
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:25,130
[SPEAKER_24]: It falls in concert with that.

210
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,613
[SPEAKER_24]: The chair recognizes Councilman.

211
00:18:28,753 --> 00:18:29,234
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

212
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:29,234
15619?

213
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:29,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

214
00:18:29,634 --> 00:18:30,895
[SPEAKER_09]: That falls in concert with this.

215
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:33,277
[SPEAKER_24]: The revolving account.

216
00:18:33,577 --> 00:18:39,922
[SPEAKER_24]: There would also be related to this, we're asking on a separate paper for the council to approve a revolving account.

217
00:18:40,557 --> 00:18:45,520
[SPEAKER_24]: And a revolving account, as you know, has to be approved by the Medford City Council or by any city council, that is.

218
00:18:46,161 --> 00:18:58,029
[SPEAKER_24]: And the purpose of a revolving account is to designate certain dollars which, when they come in, have to be essentially earmarked, escrowed is another synonym, for a particular purpose.

219
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:09,237
[SPEAKER_24]: So the request here of the mayor is that the council approve a revolving account to be used for the Medford Garden Commission, and any fees received by the commission

220
00:19:09,707 --> 00:19:28,676
[SPEAKER_24]: from its members or plot holders, or any other donations would be deposited into this particular revolving account, which would provide a source for payment of expenses related to community gardens, including but not limited to equipment, supplies, and maintenance.

221
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:35,419
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, under this proposal of this revolving account, the Director of the Office of Energy and Environment,

222
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:46,858
[SPEAKER_24]: would have the authority to approve expenditures, but the expenditures approved could never exceed $10,000 or the balance in the account.

223
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:51,282
[SPEAKER_24]: So if the balance in the account was $2,000, there could not be approval for more than $2,000.

224
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:56,467
[SPEAKER_24]: It would be driven by the balance in the account with a ceiling of $10,000.

225
00:19:57,107 --> 00:20:03,653
[SPEAKER_24]: And the director of the Office of Energy and Environment would be required to annually prepare a report

226
00:20:04,948 --> 00:20:09,692
[SPEAKER_24]: disclosing all deposits and expenditures from the account during the fiscal year.

227
00:20:10,353 --> 00:20:14,757
[SPEAKER_24]: And so that's essentially what the revolving account relationship is to the community guidance.

228
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,679
[SPEAKER_24]: And I do have that one amendment.

229
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:17,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

230
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:19,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

231
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:20,503
[SPEAKER_09]: You have the amendment, you said?

232
00:20:20,943 --> 00:20:21,644
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I do have it.

233
00:20:21,664 --> 00:20:23,586
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor has the floor.

234
00:20:23,626 --> 00:20:25,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't we let him finish his presentation?

235
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:25,968
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, okay.

236
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:27,970
[SPEAKER_24]: So it was one sentence we would have added on.

237
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:34,443
[SPEAKER_24]: And on yours, it'll be in section 2-550 under function and purpose.

238
00:20:35,244 --> 00:20:38,146
[SPEAKER_24]: Right now, as proposed to the council, it says this.

239
00:20:38,626 --> 00:20:54,075
[SPEAKER_24]: The function and purpose of the commission is to organize, coordinate, set policies, and provide oversight for various community gardens now established and to be established prospectively on property owned, controlled, and managed by the city of Bedford.

240
00:20:54,475 --> 00:20:55,756
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what it presently says.

241
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:01,875
[SPEAKER_24]: I would change the period at the end of that sentence to a comma and add these words.

242
00:21:02,756 --> 00:21:03,616
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Finn, you ready?

243
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:04,577
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

244
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:16,908
[SPEAKER_24]: With the specific exception of the community garden that presently exists at Riverbend Park in Medford, period.

245
00:21:18,918 --> 00:21:23,522
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I know that I can hear your silent question, why?

246
00:21:24,343 --> 00:21:35,472
[SPEAKER_24]: And the answer to that question why is the garden which exists at Riverbend Park, although I'm not a participant in it, I know that it's been up and running for some time.

247
00:21:36,032 --> 00:21:42,758
[SPEAKER_24]: They have in effect rules and regulations and processes and procedures that pertain to the utilization of that garden.

248
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:47,662
[SPEAKER_24]: And the request has been that they be accepted

249
00:21:48,186 --> 00:21:58,072
[SPEAKER_24]: from this, except that it may not be under the parameters of the umbrella of this particular ordinance, because they seem to have, they've been doing this for a few years now.

250
00:21:58,412 --> 00:22:01,213
[SPEAKER_24]: Their processes and procedures are already in place.

251
00:22:01,634 --> 00:22:08,177
[SPEAKER_24]: And I suppose if you needed an analogy, it would be essentially as having them grandfathered in.

252
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:13,620
[SPEAKER_24]: And those are the proposals before the council tonight.

253
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:18,453
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

254
00:22:18,513 --> 00:22:19,453
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Rumley, thank you.

255
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:27,118
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we also need to give a word of thanks to the members of the Medford Community Garden Volunteer Commission that were able to put this together.

256
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:33,602
[SPEAKER_13]: One question that I have for you, Mr. Rumley, would be the fact that we have these five total members in the alternates.

257
00:22:33,662 --> 00:22:39,365
[SPEAKER_13]: And because they're going to be appointed to serve on this commission, they would be considered city employees, correct?

258
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:44,508
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, to the same extent other boards and commission members now are indeed city employees.

259
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:46,894
[SPEAKER_24]: But there's a footnote on that.

260
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:50,435
[SPEAKER_24]: They're city employees because they operate under the city government.

261
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:56,437
[SPEAKER_24]: But they're not employees in the sense of being on payroll and entitled to benefits and all the rest.

262
00:22:56,857 --> 00:23:05,620
[SPEAKER_24]: For example, under Section 268A of the Massachusetts General Laws, conflict of interest rules apply to all municipal employees.

263
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,902
[SPEAKER_24]: And all municipal employees include even those people on boards or commissions.

264
00:23:11,402 --> 00:23:13,803
[SPEAKER_24]: So while they're considered municipal employees,

265
00:23:14,233 --> 00:23:19,175
[SPEAKER_24]: for purposes of the conflict of interest law and other provisions.

266
00:23:19,595 --> 00:23:29,359
[SPEAKER_24]: They're not city employees the way others, such as myself, would be considered, who are on the regular payroll and appointed.

267
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,662
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, Mr. Rumley, in looking at this, I think that it's very thorough.

268
00:23:37,702 --> 00:23:39,203
[SPEAKER_13]: They've done a great job putting this together.

269
00:23:40,676 --> 00:23:46,479
[SPEAKER_13]: would expect that this has your stamp of approval on it, considering that you're here presenting it to us this evening in terms of legality?

270
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:47,860
[SPEAKER_24]: The answer is yes, it does.

271
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:56,385
[SPEAKER_24]: It's also, as I said earlier, I don't want to claim that it was my exclusive labor, because it certainly was not.

272
00:23:57,345 --> 00:24:01,648
[SPEAKER_24]: All I had to do was polish up a little bit and change and recraft a couple of things.

273
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:08,832
[SPEAKER_24]: But it's the people that have put their, literally, their backs and their sweat into it that came up with the original drafts.

274
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:14,751
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've witnessed them putting their backs in sweat and into the creation of the garden down on Winthrop Street.

275
00:24:15,311 --> 00:24:20,413
[SPEAKER_13]: I've also seen a lot of excitement relative to the McNally Park Community Gardens down there.

276
00:24:20,474 --> 00:24:25,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I think this is a great piece of legislation and I would move for approval as amended.

277
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:26,817
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

278
00:24:27,297 --> 00:24:31,899
[SPEAKER_18]: On that motion, I think we have Councilor Penta, were you still in the queue here?

279
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:32,159
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

280
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:32,940
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead.

281
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Mark.

282
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:35,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

283
00:24:37,812 --> 00:24:41,953
[SPEAKER_09]: the folks that are involved with the community gardens do wonderful work.

284
00:24:42,673 --> 00:24:51,615
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's these folks as individuals and a lot of them don't have the space at their own personal residence where they could have this type of a garden.

285
00:24:52,235 --> 00:25:01,957
[SPEAKER_09]: But I have some concern over this as it relates to number one, I'm passing this tonight without knowing and having a lot of the representatives, you know, and some of the terms here is called plotters.

286
00:25:01,997 --> 00:25:07,638
[SPEAKER_09]: But one of the things that stands out at me is the mayor has all five appointments.

287
00:25:08,176 --> 00:25:17,981
[SPEAKER_09]: And since you're asking the council to make a vote of acceptance, not you, but the administration is, uh, I think the council should have one representative of their choice.

288
00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:22,164
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the, the plotters or the garden people, they should have a representative as well.

289
00:25:22,684 --> 00:25:25,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and leave all five exclusively to the mirror.

290
00:25:25,326 --> 00:25:28,948
[SPEAKER_09]: I think at this point in time, I think would not be fair.

291
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,168
[SPEAKER_09]: That's, that's number one.

292
00:25:30,949 --> 00:25:33,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Number two, it's called the river bend garden folks.

293
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:33,890
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're right.

294
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Exempting them.

295
00:25:34,771 --> 00:25:36,872
[SPEAKER_09]: They've done a wonderful job for 12 years down there.

296
00:25:37,555 --> 00:25:39,737
[SPEAKER_09]: And everything down there really works well.

297
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:43,300
[SPEAKER_09]: And they probably have set the tempo as to what's going on.

298
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:52,468
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess the question is, what are they doing so right that we need a commission to say we've got to correct something going forward?

299
00:25:53,148 --> 00:25:53,629
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

300
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:56,911
[SPEAKER_09]: These are questions that I think, you know, and the committee will hold.

301
00:25:57,592 --> 00:26:00,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Second of all, I have no idea where the $10,000 figure came from.

302
00:26:01,848 --> 00:26:02,889
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, I can tell you that.

303
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:09,974
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, that's entirely and completely a creature of my legislative hand.

304
00:26:10,494 --> 00:26:20,102
[SPEAKER_24]: I just put it there as a cap, figuring that, generally speaking, $10,000 oftentimes in procurement and in other areas of law seems to be that initial ceiling.

305
00:26:20,582 --> 00:26:25,966
[SPEAKER_24]: And whether it was $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000 is simply a matter of preference, not really a matter of law.

306
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:27,387
[SPEAKER_09]: But the Riverbend folks,

307
00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:29,221
[SPEAKER_09]: didn't have any kind of a cap.

308
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:34,202
[SPEAKER_09]: They just adjusted themselves and paid for whatever their expenses were and have been through the years.

309
00:26:34,863 --> 00:26:48,406
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I'm reading this correctly, it indicates over here, um, that not only are these, uh, plot families, um, plot holders along with donations, and they're also going to be charged a fee and inclusive of that.

310
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:56,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, the question is if, if I had my particular garden down there and I was working on it, now I'm going to be charged the fee.

311
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:57,388
[SPEAKER_09]: And then,

312
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:14,524
[SPEAKER_09]: If we are putting all of these together, and I believe it says, um, and line over here, it says each community garden or group of gardens in the case of gardens, plural of eight or fewer plots, she'll have at least one representative on the commission.

313
00:27:14,824 --> 00:27:14,984
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

314
00:27:15,304 --> 00:27:25,770
[SPEAKER_09]: So if they have one representative on the commission, the question then becomes if they have one representative on the commission and the mayor has all five, how do you, how do you get to that one member on the commission?

315
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

316
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:26,951
[SPEAKER_09]: But,

317
00:27:27,757 --> 00:27:29,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Just put that aside as a separate thought.

318
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:44,450
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just concerned over the fact that it's another tax and a fee on people who are doing something voluntarily, who are willing to take a parcel of land, cultivate it, grow it into a garden, for the purposes of which they so choose.

319
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,052
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it's on a first come, first served basis.

320
00:27:47,712 --> 00:27:55,338
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess the Riverbend folks are the best example to show you this, that through the last 12 years, they paid for all their expenses themselves, and they've shared it.

321
00:27:56,217 --> 00:28:13,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the question then becomes, if, in fact, we get all these plotters, as they're called, to have to pay an annual fee or whatever it might be, and it goes into a pool, who then makes the determination if one of these locations needs an upgrading and wants an upgrading?

322
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:23,197
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I'm in the river bend or X bend, whatever it might be, and I feel that I don't want that money to go there, I want it to stay right here in my own section, how are we going to address this and handle this?

323
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:24,498
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be by the commission.

324
00:28:24,898 --> 00:28:27,819
[SPEAKER_24]: which would have no form or function without this ordinance.

325
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:34,941
[SPEAKER_09]: So having no form of function without the ordinance right now, if you go to the one on Winthrop Street, they're basically working on their own.

326
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:37,522
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go to McNally Park, they're basically working on their own.

327
00:28:39,522 --> 00:28:48,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a good idea to have some kind of oversight, but to have it this controlled and taxing.

328
00:28:48,785 --> 00:28:49,805
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, it's like another tax.

329
00:28:50,578 --> 00:28:52,118
[SPEAKER_09]: on somebody wanting to do something.

330
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:52,898
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a fee.

331
00:28:53,078 --> 00:28:55,579
[SPEAKER_24]: I know that you're using the word in its most benign form.

332
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:57,739
[SPEAKER_24]: But I also know that you know it's not a tax.

333
00:28:57,899 --> 00:28:58,379
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a fee.

334
00:28:58,599 --> 00:28:59,160
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a fee.

335
00:28:59,240 --> 00:28:59,880
[SPEAKER_09]: It's another fee.

336
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:05,141
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're asking someone who never had to pay a fee before, now they're going to have to pay a fee, over and beyond expenses.

337
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:10,001
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, but before, you couldn't just walk onto a municipal property and plant vegetables.

338
00:29:10,262 --> 00:29:11,202
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I understand that.

339
00:29:11,782 --> 00:29:13,382
[SPEAKER_09]: But you've also been allowed to do this.

340
00:29:13,822 --> 00:29:16,603
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the last 12 years, there's a group.

341
00:29:16,643 --> 00:29:18,283
[SPEAKER_24]: Right, and because that's successful,

342
00:29:18,682 --> 00:29:31,651
[SPEAKER_24]: And because the interest in participating in community guidance is discernible and growing, it's necessary at this juncture of its growth to ensure that its proper growth take place with some degree.

343
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:36,494
[SPEAKER_24]: I wouldn't call this to be Stalinistic regulation.

344
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:37,755
[SPEAKER_24]: This is very flexible.

345
00:29:38,295 --> 00:29:42,418
[SPEAKER_24]: With some degree of regulation so that it can grow properly and orderly.

346
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:45,920
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think it's going to discourage participation.

347
00:29:46,343 --> 00:29:47,204
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the opposite.

348
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,406
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's going to increase participation.

349
00:29:49,646 --> 00:29:50,627
[SPEAKER_09]: But how do you get a fee?

350
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:52,128
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we get to this issue of a fee?

351
00:29:52,148 --> 00:29:53,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's going to make the determination of the fee?

352
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:56,852
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, there's always going to be a cost, isn't there, to a human endeavor.

353
00:29:57,032 --> 00:29:58,813
[SPEAKER_24]: There's always going to be a cost to a task.

354
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:00,615
[SPEAKER_24]: So there may be a need for soil.

355
00:30:01,215 --> 00:30:02,216
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not a great gardener.

356
00:30:02,276 --> 00:30:02,897
[SPEAKER_24]: My wife is.

357
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:11,103
[SPEAKER_24]: But there's going to be a need for soil and maybe water or shovels, et cetera, that are necessary.

358
00:30:11,463 --> 00:30:14,366
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sure that others will be much more familiar with what the needs are.

359
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:25,115
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you already have a group of people that are doing that on their own, what I don't understand is you're saying going from them forward, it's going to come under a commission.

360
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:28,918
[SPEAKER_24]: Just to give it some order.

361
00:30:29,198 --> 00:30:36,664
[SPEAKER_24]: But also, and I think I know that I'm preaching to the choir here, an ordinance doesn't become etched in granite and never change.

362
00:30:37,105 --> 00:30:43,970
[SPEAKER_24]: If it's necessary to recraft, change, or to tweak, I'm sure that that will bubble up to the surface at the right time.

363
00:30:44,404 --> 00:30:57,442
[SPEAKER_24]: But I think it's good at this point where we have a garden at Winthrop Street, and there's one the next street over from my house at McNally Park, and I'm finding that tot lot with that garden very, very well utilized.

364
00:30:57,802 --> 00:30:59,865
[SPEAKER_24]: I see that every time I drive away from my house.

365
00:31:00,366 --> 00:31:01,928
[SPEAKER_24]: It's good to have some structure so that

366
00:31:02,534 --> 00:31:03,675
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe there'll be an addition.

367
00:31:03,755 --> 00:31:05,756
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe there'll be something else that'll be necessary.

368
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:08,978
[SPEAKER_24]: Another park will come online, more community gardens.

369
00:31:09,358 --> 00:31:11,419
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand your concerns because I know what they are.

370
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:18,463
[SPEAKER_24]: You don't want to put additional burdens on people that want to engage in an extremely productive and community-based initiative.

371
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:19,844
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm with you on that.

372
00:31:20,224 --> 00:31:26,108
[SPEAKER_24]: But in order to allow them to do so in a fashion which is going to be progressive, it's going to need some structure.

373
00:31:26,488 --> 00:31:27,408
[SPEAKER_24]: That's really it.

374
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,450
[SPEAKER_09]: The only real thing, lastly, the only real thing is the $10,000.

375
00:31:32,552 --> 00:31:56,669
[SPEAKER_09]: If I was a plotter, and I was to see this ordinance, and I was to see it's going to be up to and not exceeding $10,000, does that mean at any point in time, at any one of these developments, any future development, if an assessment had to be to carry the next person forward, but in my small little world, whether it's on Winthrop Street or wherever, I'm going to be charged an additional amount of money to get to that point?

376
00:31:56,729 --> 00:32:01,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if I understand this correctly, their fees and whatever, it all goes into a pool, correct?

377
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:01,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

378
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:08,937
[SPEAKER_09]: And in that pool, whatever the location might need that's making the request, that's where the money's going to go if the commission votes on it.

379
00:32:09,277 --> 00:32:09,817
[SPEAKER_09]: That's correct, too.

380
00:32:09,837 --> 00:32:09,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

381
00:32:10,337 --> 00:32:17,501
[SPEAKER_09]: So, like I said, if I'm in my own little world and I don't want it to go there, I want it to keep it on my one subscription, whatever it might be.

382
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:18,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor, I could tell you this.

383
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:25,166
[SPEAKER_24]: If you feel a different number outside of $10,000 would be more prudent and would be more productive and useful.

384
00:32:25,886 --> 00:32:31,109
[SPEAKER_24]: As I said, that $10,000 came off of my hand with a pen saying, this sounds reasonable.

385
00:32:31,405 --> 00:32:32,886
[SPEAKER_24]: but I'm open to any suggestions.

386
00:32:33,987 --> 00:32:38,550
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, a realistic figure would probably be $3,000 to start, because I'm quite sure this is all a minimal.

387
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:40,252
[SPEAKER_09]: $3,000 is fine by me.

388
00:32:41,573 --> 00:32:44,395
[SPEAKER_09]: I would move, Mr. President, that $10,000 be reduced to $3,000.

389
00:32:44,915 --> 00:32:48,798
[SPEAKER_09]: And let's just see where this gets itself going and how the cost factor goes.

390
00:32:48,818 --> 00:32:52,020
[SPEAKER_24]: Then another — it might be necessary, as I said.

391
00:32:52,521 --> 00:32:53,582
[SPEAKER_24]: Ordinances are fluid.

392
00:32:54,062 --> 00:32:56,704
[SPEAKER_24]: If $3,000 doesn't work, we may know that fairly quickly.

393
00:32:56,844 --> 00:32:57,705
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

394
00:32:57,865 --> 00:32:59,926
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, it would mean that if there are expenditures over $3,000,

395
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:07,683
[SPEAKER_24]: We can't go into a deficit on this, obviously, because the cap on spending would be the number that you put.

396
00:33:08,263 --> 00:33:17,968
[SPEAKER_24]: So if I could be so bold as to make a suggestion, perhaps the launching figure might be, to address the concerns that you have, maybe a more prudent launching figure would be $5,000.

397
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:18,568
[SPEAKER_24]: Fair enough.

398
00:33:20,757 --> 00:33:23,359
[SPEAKER_18]: So on the motion of Council Penta to adjust this to 5,000.

399
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:27,602
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Mugler-Curran has been patiently waiting.

400
00:33:28,122 --> 00:33:29,863
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

401
00:33:30,744 --> 00:33:33,105
[SPEAKER_25]: I appreciate what Councilor Penta had to offer.

402
00:33:33,165 --> 00:33:49,616
[SPEAKER_25]: However, I know there are people here from the Garden Club, and it may be interesting to find out what the current expenditures are, the number of plots, and based on that information, because if we have a figure of 10,000 that's currently in the ordinance, to go down to 3,000 if they're already expending 5,000,

403
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,772
[SPEAKER_25]: It doesn't make any sense to me, so.

404
00:33:52,852 --> 00:33:55,874
[SPEAKER_18]: The chair was gonna invite the Garden Club members up to speak.

405
00:33:55,914 --> 00:33:56,335
[SPEAKER_18]: That's fine.

406
00:33:56,895 --> 00:33:59,017
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Marks, for your point of information.

407
00:33:59,377 --> 00:34:00,678
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

408
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:05,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll yield if you wanna, if anybody from the Garden Club wants to come up and answer that.

409
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:09,405
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a number of the councilors awaiting, and then we'll invite the Garden Club members up.

410
00:34:09,606 --> 00:34:10,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, sorry.

411
00:34:11,127 --> 00:34:16,972
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a question, City Solicitor Rumley, on section 2-556, the annual report.

412
00:34:19,411 --> 00:34:25,912
[SPEAKER_10]: and how it coordinates with the revolving account, which is number five in the revolving account.

413
00:34:25,932 --> 00:34:36,775
[SPEAKER_10]: So the director of office and energy and environment has to report, has to disclose all deposits expenditures from the revolving account.

414
00:34:36,815 --> 00:34:47,837
[SPEAKER_10]: That section doesn't say to who, where the section in the ordinance 2-556 says that the garden club has to report to the mayor and the Medford City Council.

415
00:34:49,973 --> 00:35:05,457
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it would be probably helpful to change it to 2-556 to report to the Mayor, to the City Council, and to the Office of Energy and Environment, and then have the Office of Energy and Environment have to report to the Mayor and the City Council.

416
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:09,038
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, that's entirely different from what I thought you were going to say.

417
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:22,089
[SPEAKER_24]: I thought you, if you don't mind me saying so, what I thought you were going to say is how come the annual report is made by the commission each December and the fiscal report is made at the end of the fiscal year?

418
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:31,356
[SPEAKER_24]: Because we had the, I had the commission doing its annual report in December, figuring that that was the best time to do a report dealing with gardens because it would be the beginning of the winter.

419
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:38,042
[SPEAKER_24]: But whoever gets the report and submits the report, if it should go to the mayor, the council,

420
00:35:38,733 --> 00:35:40,334
[SPEAKER_24]: anyone, that's all fluid.

421
00:35:40,354 --> 00:35:44,396
[SPEAKER_24]: You can certainly, if you want to amend it to include those other entities, fine by me.

422
00:35:44,516 --> 00:35:44,936
[SPEAKER_10]: I think so.

423
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:55,702
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think when we meet in our budget hearings in June, when we talk about the next fiscal fiscal year's budget, we, you know, we go over each commission's line item budget.

424
00:35:55,742 --> 00:36:03,066
[SPEAKER_10]: So it'll be good to have the annual report, the report from the office of energy and environment before us.

425
00:36:03,386 --> 00:36:07,888
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why I had put that in for the fiscal year, as opposed to December for the dollar report.

426
00:36:08,258 --> 00:36:09,899
[SPEAKER_24]: so that it could mimic the fiscal year.

427
00:36:11,059 --> 00:36:13,680
[SPEAKER_24]: So the fiscal year report comes at the end of the fiscal year.

428
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,921
[SPEAKER_24]: The garden report comes at the end of the seasons of gardening.

429
00:36:19,402 --> 00:36:31,166
[SPEAKER_10]: But if we could put the language in with the revolving count that the mayor, that the Office of Energy and Environment report, just like it's... That's absolutely fine.

430
00:36:31,986 --> 00:36:37,468
[SPEAKER_10]: ...report to the mayor and to the Medford City Council by the end of the fiscal year.

431
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,085
[SPEAKER_10]: then it's more fluid and we know we're going to get a report from both the club and the Office of Energy and Environment.

432
00:36:45,145 --> 00:36:51,089
[SPEAKER_10]: We know we're going to get the breakdown of fees and donations, expenditures.

433
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:53,050
[SPEAKER_10]: We know we're going to get both reports.

434
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:53,771
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be happy to-.

435
00:36:53,831 --> 00:36:56,012
[SPEAKER_10]: I think your suggestions are very helpful.

436
00:36:56,653 --> 00:36:58,434
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd make that part of the committee report.

437
00:36:58,934 --> 00:37:03,918
[SPEAKER_18]: May I take this opportunity to point out that before us for discussion right now,

438
00:37:04,506 --> 00:37:10,510
[SPEAKER_18]: is 15-518, the ordinance itself.

439
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:16,594
[SPEAKER_16]: 15-619 is the issue of the revolving account, which is not before us for discussion.

440
00:37:17,014 --> 00:37:22,778
[SPEAKER_10]: And then my last point, Councilor Penta touched on it, but I too, I know five appointments from the mayor's office.

441
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:29,942
[SPEAKER_10]: I too feel that, you know, most of our commissions are, the majority does come from the mayor's office, but the council does have appointments.

442
00:37:30,663 --> 00:37:31,243
[SPEAKER_10]: You always have,

443
00:37:31,905 --> 00:37:37,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like with the housing authority, we have a member of somebody who's actually living in the housing authority as a member.

444
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:46,134
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would recommend that somebody from the actual, you know, garden club definitely, you know, it'd be mandated that they be a member as well.

445
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:49,376
[SPEAKER_14]: So with those two amendments.

446
00:37:51,877 --> 00:37:56,780
[SPEAKER_19]: You changed the five-member

447
00:38:00,785 --> 00:38:10,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor, two members of the mayor, one from the council and one from the clubs.

448
00:38:11,109 --> 00:38:13,770
[SPEAKER_18]: So as proposed, it's broken down this way.

449
00:38:15,191 --> 00:38:19,772
[SPEAKER_18]: In a staggering of terms, one, two and three year terms as follows.

450
00:38:20,272 --> 00:38:26,875
[SPEAKER_18]: Two members for a term of three years, two members for a term of two years, one member for a term of one year.

451
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:34,171
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we have to do is to determine who is going to have appointments in each of those three categories.

452
00:38:34,451 --> 00:38:35,051
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

453
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:40,734
[SPEAKER_19]: So you want three members from the mayor?

454
00:38:40,774 --> 00:38:42,335
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you want to amend it?

455
00:38:42,595 --> 00:38:47,017
[SPEAKER_10]: One member for a three year term be, um, be a city council appointment.

456
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we can do two.

457
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:52,921
[SPEAKER_10]: So one member of the city council would have the two year term.

458
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:55,242
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe Councilor Lungo-Koehn has the chair.

459
00:38:55,824 --> 00:38:56,344
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with that.

460
00:38:56,444 --> 00:38:59,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, one person from two-member term.

461
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:02,827
[SPEAKER_09]: One member from the club is in the three-year term.

462
00:39:02,847 --> 00:39:09,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and then one member from the club be able to appoint a member for a three-year term.

463
00:39:11,831 --> 00:39:13,091
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the mayor has the last three.

464
00:39:16,473 --> 00:39:18,194
[SPEAKER_16]: They're all three-year terms.

465
00:39:18,614 --> 00:39:18,794
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

466
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,194
[SPEAKER_10]: No, three years, two years, one year.

467
00:39:20,214 --> 00:39:21,455
[SPEAKER_16]: They're all three-year terms.

468
00:39:27,796 --> 00:39:31,398
[SPEAKER_24]: If I may to the Council, every term is three years.

469
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,980
[SPEAKER_24]: Only the original terms are staggered.

470
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,561
[SPEAKER_24]: That's so that they're staggered throughout.

471
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:38,643
[SPEAKER_24]: It's kind of like walking up a flight of stairs, one, two, three.

472
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,264
[SPEAKER_24]: But once you get to the third stair, you're home.

473
00:39:41,664 --> 00:39:43,105
[SPEAKER_24]: It's three-year terms for everybody.

474
00:39:43,645 --> 00:39:48,868
[SPEAKER_24]: So you have two members for a three-year term, two for a two-year term, and two for one, but that only happens once.

475
00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:50,529
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it revolves out.

476
00:39:53,865 --> 00:39:57,846
[SPEAKER_09]: At the outset, the council gets one two-year term, because we read every two years.

477
00:39:59,507 --> 00:40:05,709
[SPEAKER_09]: The Guiding Club gets one three-year term, and the mayor gets two three-year terms, and he gets the one-year term.

478
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Starting off, that's what you said.

479
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:09,450
[SPEAKER_10]: From the outset, yeah.

480
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,110
[SPEAKER_09]: At the outset.

481
00:40:11,311 --> 00:40:12,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of clarification, Mr. President?

482
00:40:12,751 --> 00:40:15,132
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of clarification, Councilor Knight.

483
00:40:15,952 --> 00:40:20,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Would the gentleman clarify whether or not he means the council gets one as an individual member of the council, or as a council appointee?

484
00:40:20,393 --> 00:40:20,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Council appointee.

485
00:40:20,914 --> 00:40:21,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Council appointee.

486
00:40:21,494 --> 00:40:22,394
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the clarification.

487
00:40:23,372 --> 00:40:24,193
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Vice President.

488
00:40:26,154 --> 00:40:27,175
[SPEAKER_17]: That's my questions for now.

489
00:40:27,215 --> 00:40:27,535
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

490
00:40:27,755 --> 00:40:28,936
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

491
00:40:29,016 --> 00:40:29,816
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Camuso.

492
00:40:30,076 --> 00:40:30,497
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

493
00:40:30,757 --> 00:40:40,543
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, the first thing is, um, if you'd allow me just to briefly discuss the $10,000, this is money that's coming in.

494
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:46,207
[SPEAKER_32]: That's going to be user fees slash money from the gardeners to cap it at $3,000.

495
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:50,890
[SPEAKER_32]: If they're putting their own money into this revolving account, which is not appropriated through the city budget process,

496
00:40:51,455 --> 00:40:53,456
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't see why we should be capping it at $3,000.

497
00:40:54,356 --> 00:41:05,300
[SPEAKER_32]: We should give them at least the $10,000, the same that the artists are allowed to spend at a bare minimum, the same that the parks and recreation has in a revolving account.

498
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,842
[SPEAKER_32]: But to limit it, I don't see that being proactive for this startup.

499
00:41:11,282 --> 00:41:14,323
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd also like to make an amendment if the council is amenable to

500
00:41:15,293 --> 00:41:28,819
[SPEAKER_32]: The amendment that the city solicitor made to have the Riverbend Park not part of this, I would think it would be prudent for this council to do it for three calendar years after the start-up.

501
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,221
[SPEAKER_32]: At some point, they should not be running their separate and distinct operation.

502
00:41:33,662 --> 00:41:38,804
[SPEAKER_32]: It should encompass under the Garden Club, I'm sorry, the Garden Commission at some point.

503
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:44,847
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. Lasky and that crew has done a phenomenal job down there, but I just have a hard time

504
00:41:45,235 --> 00:41:54,049
[SPEAKER_32]: keeping one entity separate and distinct in the long term in the city where everything else is going to fall under this.

505
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,472
[SPEAKER_32]: It's similar to a school.

506
00:41:55,532 --> 00:41:59,338
[SPEAKER_32]: We can't say, well, all the schools are going to fall under the school committee except one school.

507
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:01,090
[SPEAKER_32]: We're going to keep that under the council.

508
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,711
[SPEAKER_32]: It just doesn't make sense.

509
00:42:03,092 --> 00:42:07,155
[SPEAKER_32]: Would the city administration be amenable to a three-year phase out?

510
00:42:08,296 --> 00:42:17,664
[SPEAKER_32]: So your amendment to make it so that the Riverbend Park is not part of this, that it would not be part of this for the initial three years.

511
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:24,349
[SPEAKER_32]: After three years, which is 36 months from now, they will become part of this ordinance as of that effective date.

512
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:29,173
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it would be unfair of me to make that affirmation without

513
00:42:29,623 --> 00:42:31,664
[SPEAKER_24]: speaking to people at the Riverbend Park.

514
00:42:32,005 --> 00:42:33,125
[SPEAKER_24]: I just don't think it would be right.

515
00:42:33,365 --> 00:42:33,766
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

516
00:42:33,786 --> 00:42:50,116
[SPEAKER_24]: The second thing is that being said, unfortunately, my second point, the second thing is when you enact an ordinance, when you say that at a certain point in the future, this will happen, what you're doing is you're preordaining knowledge of what's going to happen in three years.

517
00:42:50,673 --> 00:42:51,013
[SPEAKER_24]: Who knows?

518
00:42:51,834 --> 00:42:52,875
[SPEAKER_24]: You never know what's going to happen.

519
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:57,418
[SPEAKER_24]: But if a need arises in three years, you can address it because that's what you do.

520
00:42:57,718 --> 00:43:06,025
[SPEAKER_32]: But we also could put the language that effective upon its passage that that particular portion expires on a specific date, 36 months from the date of passage.

521
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:16,552
[SPEAKER_32]: I just don't think it's fair, to be quite honest, and I think that the people that are already at Riverbend Park should have the opportunity to continue, but at some point, it should encompass all of the gardens in the city.

522
00:43:16,752 --> 00:43:18,013
[SPEAKER_24]: I know that you want to be fair.

523
00:43:18,073 --> 00:43:19,474
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just about equity.

524
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:23,357
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I respect fairness and equity as much as the next person.

525
00:43:23,898 --> 00:43:35,607
[SPEAKER_24]: So much so that I will tell you that I spoke at length today with a person that participates significantly at Riverbend Park, who was very comforted by the fact

526
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:39,570
[SPEAKER_24]: that it was being accepted from this because of all the past history that they have.

527
00:43:40,031 --> 00:43:49,975
[SPEAKER_24]: And if I was to say right now, well, no matter what my conversation was with those people this afternoon, I'm going to, three years from now, pull them into the ordinance, then I wouldn't be acting fairly.

528
00:43:50,355 --> 00:43:51,535
[SPEAKER_24]: So I can't do that.

529
00:43:51,635 --> 00:43:55,937
[SPEAKER_32]: Unfortunately, it's, um, the paper before us is your amendment that you added.

530
00:43:56,417 --> 00:44:01,319
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, unfortunately it's the vote of the council this evening, which will send it back to the mayor for enactment.

531
00:44:01,399 --> 00:44:05,521
[SPEAKER_32]: And I, as one member of the council, uh, I just can't, um, I just have a hard time,

532
00:44:06,995 --> 00:44:08,336
[SPEAKER_32]: segregate in one current garden.

533
00:44:08,356 --> 00:44:10,316
[SPEAKER_32]: I appreciate everything that they've done.

534
00:44:10,636 --> 00:44:13,498
[SPEAKER_32]: That's why I'm giving them, I think, reasonable as three years.

535
00:44:14,778 --> 00:44:18,660
[SPEAKER_32]: And then they'll come under the auspices of this.

536
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,300
[SPEAKER_32]: I just look at all the parks in the community.

537
00:44:20,681 --> 00:44:24,362
[SPEAKER_32]: If we take one park away from the park board and now call it a separate park,

538
00:44:25,058 --> 00:44:26,619
[SPEAKER_32]: It just doesn't make sense.

539
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,760
[SPEAKER_32]: It doesn't make sense.

540
00:44:28,741 --> 00:44:36,026
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'm going to make that motion in whatever way it goes that we either suspend it or give them 36 months.

541
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:38,748
[SPEAKER_32]: I feel more comfortable doing it with the 36 months.

542
00:44:38,788 --> 00:44:43,172
[SPEAKER_32]: And I disagree with the city solicitor in this particular matter, because language is written all the time.

543
00:44:43,212 --> 00:44:54,000
[SPEAKER_32]: Matter of fact, we go back to the mills tax that was done here, and we put a date on it where the mills tax would be reviewed after several years and come back to this council.

544
00:44:54,722 --> 00:44:55,562
[SPEAKER_32]: It happens all the time.

545
00:44:56,082 --> 00:45:06,825
[SPEAKER_32]: At the state level, the MBTA now has a control board, and it expires certain regulations within the control board, expired at a certain date upon the effective passage of the legislation.

546
00:45:07,285 --> 00:45:10,486
[SPEAKER_32]: So I respectfully disagree with the solicitor in this particular matter.

547
00:45:10,826 --> 00:45:12,826
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that we can do it upon its passage.

548
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,307
[SPEAKER_32]: It's 36 months from the date of its passage.

549
00:45:16,087 --> 00:45:23,269
[SPEAKER_32]: And I just think it's in the equity of fairness and just doing the right thing for the future gardeners that are out there.

550
00:45:24,558 --> 00:45:45,971
[SPEAKER_24]: Just to respond to the example given of the meals tax, there is a significant and objective difference between the assessment of a dollar amount or a percentage dealing with meals and rooms, et cetera, and the participation in an effort like community gardens, which deals with

551
00:45:47,388 --> 00:45:56,515
[SPEAKER_24]: people, their creativity, their relaxation, their contentment, and their ability to utilize soil that otherwise wouldn't be at their disposal.

552
00:45:57,035 --> 00:46:03,219
[SPEAKER_24]: And the last point I'd make about it is, in the meals tax, there's no person that was talked to in the afternoon.

553
00:46:03,279 --> 00:46:06,541
[SPEAKER_24]: I spoke to a representative from Riverbend Park this afternoon.

554
00:46:06,962 --> 00:46:12,305
[SPEAKER_24]: It is not their consensus that they wanted to be exempt from this.

555
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:14,327
[SPEAKER_24]: So I said I would propose the amendment.

556
00:46:14,387 --> 00:46:15,828
[SPEAKER_24]: I had the acquiescence of the mayor.

557
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,532
[SPEAKER_24]: and I have no authority to back off of that amendment.

558
00:46:18,632 --> 00:46:18,932
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

559
00:46:19,072 --> 00:46:22,713
[SPEAKER_32]: But the city council has the right to either accept it, amend it.

560
00:46:22,753 --> 00:46:25,755
[SPEAKER_32]: We've made other amendments this evening, uh, to the paper.

561
00:46:26,155 --> 00:46:31,097
[SPEAKER_32]: So, uh, with all due respect, if the mayor's paper, um, I think there's a fairer way to do it.

562
00:46:31,137 --> 00:46:33,898
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm going to make that amendment and whatever way my colleagues see fit.

563
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:35,918
[SPEAKER_32]: Uh, that's it.

564
00:46:35,938 --> 00:46:45,842
[SPEAKER_32]: So an amendment that upon the effective passage of this paper, that the garden club at river Bend park, uh, stays separate and distinct for 36 months from the date of its passage.

565
00:46:46,192 --> 00:46:58,243
[SPEAKER_32]: And then at that point, the 37th month, it would fall under the domain of the Garden Commission, which, and quite honestly, I hope Riverbend Park helps this commission, because they've done a fabulous job down there.

566
00:46:58,843 --> 00:47:02,346
[SPEAKER_32]: This is an incentive to make the whole thing work by including them as well.

567
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:04,148
[SPEAKER_32]: So I make that amendment.

568
00:47:05,049 --> 00:47:06,910
[SPEAKER_15]: As amended by Councilor Camuso.

569
00:47:26,749 --> 00:47:28,470
[SPEAKER_18]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

570
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:29,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

571
00:47:29,831 --> 00:47:31,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Solicitor, can I answer your question?

572
00:47:33,714 --> 00:47:39,397
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I'd like to commend the commission, the guiding community for the great work.

573
00:47:39,998 --> 00:47:42,920
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, for one, would hope they expand into

574
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:47,001
[SPEAKER_05]: other areas, especially that big lot on Grove Street and maybe on the other side of the river.

575
00:47:47,581 --> 00:47:59,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, when these groups, uh, let's say when they, when they start to expand going down the line, it says here that, um, that, uh, there are provision we've made.

576
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:05,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, how, how would, how would the membership be made on, uh, on going forward by the size of the garden?

577
00:48:05,565 --> 00:48:11,746
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, well, yes, if there was, if there was small, I believe it says if there's eight or less, uh,

578
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:16,292
[SPEAKER_24]: eight or less plots, that would be a smaller garden.

579
00:48:18,152 --> 00:48:22,755
[SPEAKER_24]: Groups of gardens of less than eight would have one representative, but more than eight would have one.

580
00:48:23,555 --> 00:48:31,879
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that the plots right now, as I understand it, Winthrop Street has anywhere from 13 to 17 plots, and they're about at half capacity.

581
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:33,339
[SPEAKER_24]: I could be wrong about that.

582
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,340
[SPEAKER_24]: And McNally has four.

583
00:48:37,141 --> 00:48:38,342
[SPEAKER_24]: So they're fairly small right now.

584
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:50,813
[SPEAKER_05]: There's more people that are interested in them, and I hope they grow and get full, and we expand it into different areas of the community.

585
00:48:51,313 --> 00:48:51,553
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure.

586
00:48:51,813 --> 00:48:53,494
[SPEAKER_24]: I think those are fine sentiments.

587
00:48:58,636 --> 00:48:59,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

588
00:49:00,417 --> 00:49:01,357
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

589
00:49:01,417 --> 00:49:10,761
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm not sure if this is an appropriate question to the city solicitor or maybe someone from the guiding club, but the way I understand it right now, the Riverbend Park

590
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,841
[SPEAKER_25]: for many years had a waiting list.

591
00:49:13,382 --> 00:49:16,224
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm glad to see this program expand to other parks.

592
00:49:16,644 --> 00:49:20,648
[SPEAKER_25]: We do have 26 parks in the city, many of which are underutilized.

593
00:49:21,949 --> 00:49:27,473
[SPEAKER_25]: But currently, I guess I'd like to find out if there is a waiting list, just say at the Riverbend Park.

594
00:49:28,354 --> 00:49:38,122
[SPEAKER_25]: And under this particular ordinance, if I was on the waiting list at Riverbend Park and not knowing anything about fees or anything else at that park,

595
00:49:38,969 --> 00:49:42,493
[SPEAKER_25]: And an opening came up at McNally or Winthrop Street.

596
00:49:43,053 --> 00:49:44,995
[SPEAKER_25]: Am I eligible to fill that opening?

597
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:53,463
[SPEAKER_25]: Would I have to pay the fee that's dictated by the commission based on Winthrop Street and McNally?

598
00:50:11,247 --> 00:50:18,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor, why don't we invite this representative of the group to come up and address the Council.

599
00:50:19,232 --> 00:50:23,175
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a president or a leader of your group that wishes to address us?

600
00:50:23,255 --> 00:50:29,679
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we kindly invite all of you who wish to speak on this when it's appropriate.

601
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:32,321
[SPEAKER_18]: But the Councilor seems to have agreed to it.

602
00:50:33,075 --> 00:50:36,416
[SPEAKER_18]: interjected you in here, so we'll allow you all to speak now.

603
00:50:36,456 --> 00:50:38,016
[SPEAKER_29]: My name's Amanda Bowen at the moment.

604
00:50:38,096 --> 00:50:41,537
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm the president of our loosely formed group.

605
00:50:41,577 --> 00:50:49,939
[SPEAKER_29]: I just wanted to clarify that the Medford Garden Club has provided membership for our organization, but the Garden Club is a separate entity.

606
00:50:50,019 --> 00:50:57,641
[SPEAKER_29]: We're calling ourselves the Medford, I don't know what, we've called ourselves a number of different things, but we're headed toward commission, we hope.

607
00:50:59,582 --> 00:51:00,302
[SPEAKER_25]: What is that again?

608
00:51:00,362 --> 00:51:01,182
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry, I didn't get the last.

609
00:51:02,002 --> 00:51:07,505
[SPEAKER_29]: We have called ourselves a variety of things, but we are distinct from the Garden Club.

610
00:51:07,545 --> 00:51:16,511
[SPEAKER_29]: The Garden Club is a separate entity, which focuses on gardens in general, and we are focused on community gardens, gardens for the community.

611
00:51:18,512 --> 00:51:19,352
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what we're doing.

612
00:51:19,412 --> 00:51:23,675
[SPEAKER_25]: But if you're following their, from what we just heard, their rules and regulations and

613
00:51:23,943 --> 00:51:28,484
[SPEAKER_25]: trying to mirror exactly what they're doing, then why wouldn't it be a combined effort?

614
00:51:28,664 --> 00:51:30,245
[SPEAKER_25]: And why would there be a separation?

615
00:51:30,385 --> 00:51:39,608
[SPEAKER_29]: Riverbend has worked very well for a long time, and they feel strongly that they have done a good job and supported themselves.

616
00:51:39,668 --> 00:51:46,490
[SPEAKER_29]: And so they are, I think, if I had to conjecture, I would say that they're waiting to see how things work out.

617
00:51:46,924 --> 00:51:51,426
[SPEAKER_29]: with the other ones, and I don't think there's any worry that eventually they will be part of the fold.

618
00:51:52,587 --> 00:51:55,329
[SPEAKER_29]: But at the moment, they've been a model for us.

619
00:51:55,529 --> 00:52:02,773
[SPEAKER_29]: We've also been looking at community gardens in all the surrounding communities to get ideas about how to run this.

620
00:52:04,273 --> 00:52:08,696
[SPEAKER_25]: So there'll be an ability to cross-pollinate memberships?

621
00:52:08,716 --> 00:52:09,296
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, absolutely.

622
00:52:09,336 --> 00:52:10,777
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, we're talking to them all the time.

623
00:52:11,377 --> 00:52:16,240
[SPEAKER_29]: And Fred Lasky, as a representative of Riverbend, is in our group that meets once a month.

624
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,262
[SPEAKER_29]: So he comes and talks to us about what they do.

625
00:52:20,282 --> 00:52:22,583
[SPEAKER_25]: OK.

626
00:52:22,783 --> 00:52:29,748
[SPEAKER_25]: And just if you could, just because I've seen the McNally and also the Winthrop, how many plots are at Winthrop?

627
00:52:30,168 --> 00:52:37,312
[SPEAKER_29]: Winthrop, we have 18 now, and we should have 36 after our next build, which is happening at the end of the month.

628
00:52:39,354 --> 00:52:40,915
[SPEAKER_25]: And McNally Park?

629
00:52:41,615 --> 00:52:45,918
[SPEAKER_29]: McNally is four, and that's all that was built as part of that park renovation.

630
00:52:46,298 --> 00:52:46,458
[SPEAKER_25]: Four.

631
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:49,338
[SPEAKER_25]: And are they roughly the same square footage?

632
00:52:49,698 --> 00:52:49,938
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

633
00:52:49,978 --> 00:52:56,920
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, they, they, they, I think McNally might be a little bit smaller each plot, but they're, they're roughly the same size.

634
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,120
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

635
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:03,002
[SPEAKER_25]: And as an organization, how do you control the use of water within any of these sites?

636
00:53:04,542 --> 00:53:10,624
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, I'm not the best person to answer that, but I think that the city has provided us with water at Winthrop.

637
00:53:11,284 --> 00:53:14,625
[SPEAKER_29]: And so, um, and they've had a little trouble getting it to work properly.

638
00:53:15,062 --> 00:53:18,104
[SPEAKER_29]: But the fact is, the city is providing the water.

639
00:53:19,465 --> 00:53:20,085
[SPEAKER_25]: Is it metered?

640
00:53:20,786 --> 00:53:21,446
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't believe so.

641
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:24,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Would the club be opposed to it?

642
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:27,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

643
00:53:28,912 --> 00:53:38,879
[SPEAKER_13]: It is my understanding that McNally Park is metered, and it's metered as part of the general park maintenance meter, not just exclusively to the community garden, but it's metered as part of hot maintenance.

644
00:53:38,939 --> 00:53:40,900
[SPEAKER_29]: It's coming off a water line, which is there.

645
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,480
[SPEAKER_13]: That's at McNally.

646
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,461
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't speak to Winthrop.

647
00:53:42,828 --> 00:53:46,629
[SPEAKER_29]: It's coming off a water line, which is there for irrigation at the condensation.

648
00:53:48,149 --> 00:54:03,393
[SPEAKER_25]: I just think maybe for future reference, it may be worthwhile for your group or even this council recommend that a meter be put in just to safeguard the group and to make sure that it'll be a way of tracking year after year to see what's currently used.

649
00:54:03,453 --> 00:54:06,914
[SPEAKER_25]: Because as you know, that is considered unaccounted for water.

650
00:54:07,467 --> 00:54:09,728
[SPEAKER_25]: And we all pay for that as rate payers.

651
00:54:10,468 --> 00:54:18,790
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think it's a great use and it's worthwhile, but I think there needs to be a way of seeing what's being used and also the ability to control it.

652
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:23,151
[SPEAKER_25]: But I applaud everyone for their work on an ordinance.

653
00:54:23,912 --> 00:54:26,392
[SPEAKER_25]: As you can see, I'm sure a lot of time and effort went into this.

654
00:54:27,153 --> 00:54:32,074
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's easy to pick it apart, but I know there's a lot of work that went into this.

655
00:54:32,174 --> 00:54:35,675
[SPEAKER_25]: And I look forward to the eventual expanding of this program.

656
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:44,294
[SPEAKER_25]: I remember the days of the Victory Gardens on Grove Street, and there had to be 100 plots in there, and it was real bustling.

657
00:54:44,434 --> 00:54:51,257
[SPEAKER_25]: And I would love to see this expanded in other neighborhoods where people can walk down and do their own garden.

658
00:54:51,717 --> 00:54:55,339
[SPEAKER_29]: And we certainly hope to go move beyond just Winthrop and McMahon.

659
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:56,280
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you for your involvement.

660
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:57,860
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

661
00:54:58,481 --> 00:55:04,984
[SPEAKER_18]: And the council invites those of you who've been involved in this to just line up to present to the council, and especially

662
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:14,580
[SPEAKER_15]: if you want to speak particularly to the content of the ordinance and your participation in drafting it would be most helpful for our deliberations.

663
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:21,063
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you want to come on up and please state your name and address for the welcome, for the record and welcome.

664
00:55:21,604 --> 00:55:22,624
[SPEAKER_31]: My name is Lisa Risley.

665
00:55:22,684 --> 00:55:24,065
[SPEAKER_31]: Most people know me as Riz.

666
00:55:24,285 --> 00:55:29,007
[SPEAKER_31]: I live at 93 Cedar Road North up in North Medford, the Heights, whatever they want to call it.

667
00:55:30,348 --> 00:55:31,889
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm the treasurer for the Friends Group.

668
00:55:32,403 --> 00:55:42,507
[SPEAKER_31]: And we are officially known, we are 501.3C group, bless you.

669
00:55:42,587 --> 00:55:45,809
[SPEAKER_31]: We've been formed for about a year now, so we do have tax-exempt status.

670
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:47,750
[SPEAKER_31]: We have been raising money.

671
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:51,711
[SPEAKER_31]: So we are known as the Friends of Medford Community Gardens.

672
00:55:53,352 --> 00:56:00,015
[SPEAKER_31]: Winthrop Street is a miracle, with many thanks to Fred Lasky for his assistance, his help, and able advising.

673
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,191
[SPEAKER_31]: that was pulled off in a month.

674
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:08,213
[SPEAKER_31]: Winthrop was built, Councilman Penta, you raised concerns about the fees.

675
00:56:09,233 --> 00:56:14,575
[SPEAKER_31]: Winthrop was built by paying $6,000 in expenditures.

676
00:56:15,295 --> 00:56:16,916
[SPEAKER_31]: That was what it cost to build that garden.

677
00:56:17,596 --> 00:56:20,897
[SPEAKER_31]: And a lot of volunteer labor, hard labor.

678
00:56:21,557 --> 00:56:26,119
[SPEAKER_31]: And people who just said, we're gonna do this, this is our neighborhood, and we are going to build it.

679
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,060
[SPEAKER_31]: That money,

680
00:56:30,008 --> 00:56:38,191
[SPEAKER_31]: came from a $5,000 gift from Go Green Medford, and money raised in donations, sales of silly little flappy flowers.

681
00:56:38,991 --> 00:56:40,572
[SPEAKER_31]: Anybody wants to buy one to support?

682
00:56:40,832 --> 00:56:43,993
[SPEAKER_31]: Let me know, $5, I'm the treasurer, I keep all this stuff.

683
00:56:46,434 --> 00:56:52,837
[SPEAKER_31]: As for accounting, every single fee that is collected, we charge $25 for a plot.

684
00:56:55,438 --> 00:56:58,939
[SPEAKER_31]: I have a long experience as an accounting for

685
00:56:59,675 --> 00:57:00,336
[SPEAKER_31]: in academia.

686
00:57:01,477 --> 00:57:05,881
[SPEAKER_31]: My background, I was the bookkeeper for an academic library.

687
00:57:05,921 --> 00:57:10,525
[SPEAKER_31]: I had five separate collections with budgets, so I'm used to juggling a lot of figures.

688
00:57:11,786 --> 00:57:14,509
[SPEAKER_31]: Every garden has its own spreadsheet.

689
00:57:14,609 --> 00:57:16,010
[SPEAKER_31]: Right now, it's two gardens.

690
00:57:16,711 --> 00:57:19,013
[SPEAKER_31]: There's one for McNally, one for Winthrop.

691
00:57:19,713 --> 00:57:24,718
[SPEAKER_31]: And every $25 that comes in is recorded in the appropriate thing, and that is the account for that garden.

692
00:57:25,453 --> 00:57:30,096
[SPEAKER_31]: The people making up the decision as to how that money is spent are the people who are gardening there.

693
00:57:30,997 --> 00:57:33,999
[SPEAKER_31]: If they say, we need a hose, get a hose.

694
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:35,760
[SPEAKER_31]: That's fine.

695
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,881
[SPEAKER_31]: Make sure I have a receipt.

696
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:39,583
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm sorry.

697
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,364
[SPEAKER_31]: Again, I worked in academia.

698
00:57:41,444 --> 00:57:44,647
[SPEAKER_31]: I know you cannot do anything without a receipt or a purchase order.

699
00:57:45,167 --> 00:57:50,951
[SPEAKER_31]: I am not writing a check to anybody unless I have receipts for every single cent spent.

700
00:57:52,732 --> 00:57:53,193
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm a little...

701
00:57:54,178 --> 00:57:57,379
[SPEAKER_31]: Anal retentive that way, but then again, I want us to be covered.

702
00:57:57,419 --> 00:57:58,199
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't want any problems.

703
00:57:58,219 --> 00:57:59,299
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't want any questions.

704
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,061
[SPEAKER_31]: This is important because right now, we're at the beginning.

705
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:05,021
[SPEAKER_31]: We're all getting along.

706
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:05,661
[SPEAKER_31]: We're all good.

707
00:58:05,741 --> 00:58:06,641
[SPEAKER_31]: Everything's happy.

708
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:08,002
[SPEAKER_31]: We want to keep it this way.

709
00:58:08,762 --> 00:58:10,002
[SPEAKER_31]: We want to stay good neighbors.

710
00:58:11,243 --> 00:58:13,183
[SPEAKER_31]: So the gardeners are deciding.

711
00:58:14,103 --> 00:58:16,984
[SPEAKER_31]: There is a provision when people apply for a garden plot.

712
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:19,865
[SPEAKER_31]: We want to know if someone is in hard times.

713
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:28,727
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, if you're, I'm sorry, if you're in one of the housing developments here and you're having a hard time just covering your food bill, we're not going to take money out of your pocket.

714
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:29,948
[SPEAKER_31]: We're not going to take food.

715
00:58:30,008 --> 00:58:32,671
[SPEAKER_31]: We want to know and make provisions for people.

716
00:58:33,952 --> 00:58:43,080
[SPEAKER_31]: Ideally, I know that we've been told that there is a plan that hopefully as all of our parks come online for revamping that they're going to put new community garden beds in the

717
00:58:43,956 --> 00:58:45,157
[SPEAKER_31]: We'd love to see that happen.

718
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:53,861
[SPEAKER_31]: We've had chats with Mike Nestor in the Parks Department about all of these little green spaces that aren't big enough for parks, but we could put a raised bed there.

719
00:58:54,602 --> 00:58:56,223
[SPEAKER_31]: We would love to do that.

720
00:58:56,683 --> 00:59:06,208
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a lot of us who are experienced gardeners, and we want to see everybody who wants that opportunity get it, and do it as effectively as possible.

721
00:59:06,548 --> 00:59:09,590
[SPEAKER_31]: We have experienced grant writers in the Friends Group who are working on this.

722
00:59:13,038 --> 00:59:21,685
[SPEAKER_31]: Riverbend was built, yes, by the people there, but they had help from neighborhood organizations and businesses in the neighborhood.

723
00:59:21,945 --> 00:59:23,486
[SPEAKER_31]: We're reaching out to those businesses.

724
00:59:24,707 --> 00:59:28,990
[SPEAKER_31]: Riverbend, I'm not challenging the amendment at all.

725
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:32,953
[SPEAKER_31]: Their request to remain a separate entity, I completely respect and understand.

726
00:59:33,013 --> 00:59:33,714
[SPEAKER_31]: We respect it.

727
00:59:34,334 --> 00:59:34,755
[SPEAKER_31]: We get it.

728
00:59:34,855 --> 00:59:38,538
[SPEAKER_31]: They've worked hard and it's like, oh my God, don't pull us in.

729
00:59:38,738 --> 00:59:41,580
[SPEAKER_31]: It's cool, but our intent

730
00:59:42,252 --> 00:59:45,573
[SPEAKER_31]: is that all of Medford, we're all, we're working for all of Medford.

731
00:59:45,613 --> 00:59:46,973
[SPEAKER_31]: We're working for every neighborhood.

732
00:59:47,613 --> 00:59:50,954
[SPEAKER_31]: So we want to make sure it goes forward.

733
00:59:54,915 --> 00:59:55,695
[SPEAKER_30]: Just a quick question.

734
00:59:55,815 --> 00:59:58,656
[SPEAKER_30]: When you say $25 for a plot, is that like a yearly fee?

735
00:59:58,756 --> 00:59:59,816
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the yearly fee.

736
01:00:00,417 --> 01:00:02,457
[SPEAKER_30]: And they decide how that money is being spent, not us.

737
01:00:02,597 --> 01:00:04,898
[SPEAKER_30]: So that's the way you create an expense account.

738
01:00:05,118 --> 01:00:09,719
[SPEAKER_31]: They have, and they have their own, and my spreadsheets are, there's a donation spreadsheet.

739
01:00:10,572 --> 01:00:12,754
[SPEAKER_31]: There's the general fund, that's where the donations go to.

740
01:00:12,834 --> 01:00:14,596
[SPEAKER_31]: There's, you know, the plot funds.

741
01:00:15,037 --> 01:00:18,620
[SPEAKER_31]: And there's an accounting of every dime that has gone out, every check that's been written.

742
01:00:18,901 --> 01:00:19,181
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

743
01:00:19,742 --> 01:00:28,811
[SPEAKER_18]: And if I could, I apologize for speaking from the chair, but will that then, pending approval of everything, be rolled into the revolving account?

744
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:31,514
[SPEAKER_31]: That is to be, sir, that's to be decided.

745
01:00:31,534 --> 01:00:33,075
[SPEAKER_31]: The revolving account is,

746
01:00:34,092 --> 01:00:41,173
[SPEAKER_31]: something that, at this point, I'm not a commissioner, so I'm not going to say, you know, yes, this money is going here.

747
01:00:42,474 --> 01:00:43,954
[SPEAKER_31]: That needs to be negotiated.

748
01:00:44,194 --> 01:00:45,254
[SPEAKER_31]: That needs to be figured out.

749
01:00:46,654 --> 01:01:01,017
[SPEAKER_31]: Again, we are an official 501.3 organization, 3C organization, just like the Friends of the Public Library, and we will be happy to continue to operate as the Friends Group, you know, no matter what happens here, because we need to see this happen.

750
01:01:02,394 --> 01:01:04,775
[SPEAKER_25]: A question for the speaker from Councilor Marks.

751
01:01:06,096 --> 01:01:09,718
[SPEAKER_25]: You may not know, but what is the current waiting list at Riverbend?

752
01:01:09,738 --> 01:01:10,158
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you know?

753
01:01:10,779 --> 01:01:12,040
[SPEAKER_31]: Riverbend, I'm unaware.

754
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:15,702
[SPEAKER_31]: I know it is revolving because people move, people leave.

755
01:01:15,722 --> 01:01:17,863
[SPEAKER_31]: They don't always tell them that they're being taken off the waiting list.

756
01:01:19,824 --> 01:01:20,925
[SPEAKER_31]: I've heard both sides of it.

757
01:01:21,605 --> 01:01:24,547
[SPEAKER_31]: So, I mean, I've heard from Riverbend folks.

758
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,827
[SPEAKER_31]: It's like, oh, no, it's not a big deal.

759
01:01:25,847 --> 01:01:27,388
[SPEAKER_31]: And I've heard from people, oh, I could never get in.

760
01:01:28,349 --> 01:01:30,430
[SPEAKER_31]: So, for me, I take everything with a grain of salt.

761
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:31,931
[SPEAKER_31]: So, I think it's somewhere in the middle.

762
01:01:32,591 --> 01:01:36,893
[SPEAKER_31]: that there might be people who've waited for a long time, and there might be people who weren't following up.

763
01:01:38,314 --> 01:01:40,736
[SPEAKER_31]: So that's a question for the Riverbend folks.

764
01:01:41,816 --> 01:01:45,518
[SPEAKER_31]: Our waiting list is not that extensive right now because people are just learning we're there.

765
01:01:46,379 --> 01:01:51,041
[SPEAKER_31]: I would love to see our waiting list be like 100 people so I could come to you guys and say, please.

766
01:01:53,183 --> 01:02:00,807
[SPEAKER_25]: Are there any provisions that would have people maybe have a lot for a year, two year, three year, and have to turn it over?

767
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:05,344
[SPEAKER_31]: That has been, actually Winthrop is, I believe, divided at this point.

768
01:02:06,705 --> 01:02:07,045
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm wrong.

769
01:02:08,306 --> 01:02:22,373
[SPEAKER_31]: Because the license at first was only for one year, everybody only has their plot for one year, the decision will be made as to whether or not we're going to split for people only having like a three year or five year.

770
01:02:22,653 --> 01:02:25,575
[SPEAKER_31]: That's been a big, it's been a very big and contentious discussion.

771
01:02:26,415 --> 01:02:28,977
[SPEAKER_31]: So I cannot answer your question completely, but that is,

772
01:02:30,393 --> 01:02:32,215
[SPEAKER_31]: And can people split a plot?

773
01:02:32,595 --> 01:02:32,835
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

774
01:02:33,676 --> 01:02:37,539
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, we have two folks who are sharing one of the McNally plots.

775
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:39,721
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

776
01:02:40,141 --> 01:02:40,541
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.

777
01:02:40,661 --> 01:02:41,322
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight?

778
01:02:43,524 --> 01:02:44,044
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, sir.

779
01:02:44,104 --> 01:02:44,584
[SPEAKER_13]: No, thank you.

780
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:47,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for coming this evening, and thank you for your work.

781
01:02:48,447 --> 01:02:51,290
[SPEAKER_13]: Certainly, this is the fruits of your labor and the labor of the Friends Group.

782
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,511
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm one of the noobs.

783
01:02:53,852 --> 01:02:54,792
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm just the administrator.

784
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:55,773
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm not one of the heavy lifters.

785
01:02:57,492 --> 01:03:03,414
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the questions that I have, and it might not be appropriate for you because you are an administrator, would be, you know, we see the community gardens right now.

786
01:03:03,454 --> 01:03:04,014
[SPEAKER_13]: They're bustling.

787
01:03:04,054 --> 01:03:05,355
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a lot of growth down there.

788
01:03:05,375 --> 01:03:09,696
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you walk down Winthrop Street and you have eight feet worth of tomato plants well over my head.

789
01:03:10,797 --> 01:03:11,497
[SPEAKER_13]: At the end of the season,

790
01:03:12,528 --> 01:03:13,128
[SPEAKER_13]: what's going to happen?

791
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:15,250
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that stuff going to be left there to compost?

792
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:16,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it going to be pulled out?

793
01:03:16,551 --> 01:03:21,074
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the direction that we're looking at in terms of when we're out of season versus when we're in season?

794
01:03:21,314 --> 01:03:25,217
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks great when it's in bloom, but what happens when it's not in bloom?

795
01:03:25,537 --> 01:03:29,580
[SPEAKER_31]: Every gardener signs a waiver, a liability waiver.

796
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,703
[SPEAKER_31]: So they accept their own personal responsibility.

797
01:03:34,203 --> 01:03:35,784
[SPEAKER_31]: Every gardener also signs the rules.

798
01:03:36,225 --> 01:03:41,068
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's a very set thing of you will tend your plot, you will weed your plot.

799
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:45,012
[SPEAKER_31]: The garden will close at the end of the season.

800
01:03:45,132 --> 01:03:47,073
[SPEAKER_31]: Everyone is expected to clear their waste.

801
01:03:48,874 --> 01:03:49,875
[SPEAKER_31]: Compost will happen.

802
01:03:50,935 --> 01:03:59,520
[SPEAKER_31]: I am not in the Winthrop Garden, but I know the wonderful people that run it, and they are avid gardeners.

803
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:00,200
[SPEAKER_31]: They don't want rats.

804
01:04:00,581 --> 01:04:01,161
[SPEAKER_31]: They don't want

805
01:04:03,513 --> 01:04:03,853
[SPEAKER_31]: waste.

806
01:04:03,913 --> 01:04:06,495
[SPEAKER_31]: They don't want an eyesore because it is.

807
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:09,137
[SPEAKER_31]: You go past it on Route 16 and you can see it.

808
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:12,240
[SPEAKER_31]: So there are very, there are rules that every gardener must agree to.

809
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:20,426
[SPEAKER_31]: And if you do not follow those rules and they're common sense, they're not draconian, like it's, you will be responsible.

810
01:04:21,547 --> 01:04:22,487
[SPEAKER_31]: You will remain tamed.

811
01:04:23,048 --> 01:04:24,909
[SPEAKER_31]: If you have a problem, tell us.

812
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:26,831
[SPEAKER_31]: We're a neighborhood community.

813
01:04:26,851 --> 01:04:29,993
[SPEAKER_31]: We're going to work together and everything will be maintained.

814
01:04:30,943 --> 01:04:32,764
[SPEAKER_31]: So there will not be an ICER at the end of the season.

815
01:04:32,784 --> 01:04:37,926
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it might even be premature to ask, because at this point in time, if we establish the commission, they have the right to establish the regulations.

816
01:04:38,026 --> 01:04:41,688
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess I was more concerned about what the practice is now and what's going to happen at the end of this season.

817
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:45,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Once we establish the commission, the commission has the right to set these regulations.

818
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:47,411
[SPEAKER_31]: This was well thought out.

819
01:04:48,031 --> 01:04:53,314
[SPEAKER_31]: The folks that have been working on this for two plus years, this stuff was well thought out long beforehand.

820
01:04:53,734 --> 01:04:57,696
[SPEAKER_31]: They wanted to be sure that these kind of concerns were going to be addressed immediately.

821
01:04:58,836 --> 01:05:00,597
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that you guys have done an excellent job.

822
01:05:01,257 --> 01:05:12,101
[SPEAKER_11]: certainly circling the wagons and paying close attention to detail and thinking of, you know, a lot of issues and items that might come up that aren't necessarily something that you'd see in the day-to-day operations.

823
01:05:12,421 --> 01:05:14,201
[SPEAKER_11]: You've done a great job.

824
01:05:14,241 --> 01:05:16,162
[SPEAKER_11]: You've done a great job, and that's why I support the ordinance.

825
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:17,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

826
01:05:17,482 --> 01:05:17,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

827
01:05:17,762 --> 01:05:18,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

828
01:05:18,803 --> 01:05:19,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Penta.

829
01:05:20,723 --> 01:05:21,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I find this very intriguing.

830
01:05:22,104 --> 01:05:24,665
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a very nuts and bolts guy when it comes to dollars and cents.

831
01:05:24,885 --> 01:05:25,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

832
01:05:25,365 --> 01:05:29,186
[SPEAKER_09]: So please just explain to me, you said it costs $6,000 to get to Winthrop Street.

833
01:05:29,567 --> 01:05:29,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

834
01:05:30,028 --> 01:05:32,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that shared by the 13 folks that are there now?

835
01:05:33,631 --> 01:05:34,913
[SPEAKER_31]: The building cost was not.

836
01:05:35,233 --> 01:05:38,597
[SPEAKER_31]: The building cost was covered by Go Green Medford's grant.

837
01:05:38,617 --> 01:05:39,398
[SPEAKER_31]: No, I'm sorry.

838
01:05:40,339 --> 01:05:40,499
[SPEAKER_31]: What?

839
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:42,701
[SPEAKER_31]: Green Medford, I'm sorry.

840
01:05:44,223 --> 01:05:50,750
[SPEAKER_31]: We had been given money at the beginning of when we opened the account in October.

841
01:05:51,490 --> 01:06:00,435
[SPEAKER_31]: We had $5,100 seed money and raised the additional funds to cover.

842
01:06:01,456 --> 01:06:04,137
[SPEAKER_31]: So that $6,000 came from donations.

843
01:06:04,497 --> 01:06:12,342
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, so now with that being said, and you folks that are out there working it, what do you actually think it's going to cost to get through this first year?

844
01:06:13,442 --> 01:06:14,343
[SPEAKER_31]: We're finding that out.

845
01:06:14,863 --> 01:06:16,884
[SPEAKER_31]: Right now, it's about paying for a hose.

846
01:06:18,699 --> 01:06:20,420
[SPEAKER_31]: it's about paying for the splitter.

847
01:06:23,441 --> 01:06:24,741
[SPEAKER_31]: If I may, just momentarily.

848
01:06:24,901 --> 01:06:31,243
[SPEAKER_31]: Susan and Elise, money is going towards equipment that you guys need, yes?

849
01:06:32,163 --> 01:06:33,083
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and it's minimal.

850
01:06:33,384 --> 01:06:39,566
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, it's... There's also going to the splitters, which basically you're able to do them without getting a fence.

851
01:06:39,906 --> 01:06:40,146
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

852
01:06:40,206 --> 01:06:41,406
That's about it.

853
01:06:41,686 --> 01:06:43,867
Otherwise, people have some money for their living.

854
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:52,041
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

855
01:06:52,121 --> 01:06:55,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, taking what you just said into consideration, Mr. Clerk—I mean, Mr. Solicitor.

856
01:06:57,485 --> 01:06:59,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Solicitor, could you come here real quick?

857
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:01,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Because she's getting to the nub of my question.

858
01:07:03,149 --> 01:07:13,417
[SPEAKER_09]: When we talked about the original dollar amount of $10,000, and now we have it down to $5,000, and just hearing the young lady in the back of the hall just basically say what they're purchasing and buying.

859
01:07:14,297 --> 01:07:21,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Does this mean that the fees that this new ordinance is going to have is going to cover all that so you folks don't have to pay for that or not?

860
01:07:22,982 --> 01:07:23,182
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

861
01:07:23,983 --> 01:07:27,345
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess my question is, what is this money going to be used for for the fees?

862
01:07:27,845 --> 01:07:31,768
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, it says right in the ordinance that it would be used for the expenses of the garden.

863
01:07:31,788 --> 01:07:34,869
[SPEAKER_24]: It has to be related to the expenses of the garden.

864
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:38,852
[SPEAKER_24]: And if that figure, by the way, were $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000, the expenditures could be no more than

865
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:46,182
[SPEAKER_24]: 4,300, if only 4,300 were raised.

866
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:49,943
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's why I thought a softer figure was 10.

867
01:07:51,504 --> 01:08:02,549
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I'm just confused because if you folks are donating all your own time, effort, and money into all of this, I think, can you just explain it better?

868
01:08:02,629 --> 01:08:03,710
[SPEAKER_31]: You guys know what you're doing.

869
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:08,372
[SPEAKER_31]: Councilman Penta, if I may, one of the things that we will need to replenish soil, okay?

870
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,922
[SPEAKER_31]: We will need to help provide soil amendments.

871
01:08:10,962 --> 01:08:12,563
[SPEAKER_31]: That's what some of this money is going to go towards.

872
01:08:27,992 --> 01:08:30,695
[SPEAKER_01]: As a group, we've expended $6,000 to build it.

873
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:36,700
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me to pay $25 to build to garden, I'm a gardener at McNally Park in one of the four beds there.

874
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:37,180
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.

875
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:37,881
[SPEAKER_01]: My kids love it.

876
01:08:38,381 --> 01:08:40,984
[SPEAKER_01]: We enjoy spending time with the other community members there.

877
01:08:41,444 --> 01:08:44,287
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a huge benefit to me, and I'm happy to pay $25 to have access.

878
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:50,091
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to probably end up making bulk compost orders, if you want a number on something.

879
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:56,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost might not seem like it costs very much, but when you have 36 beds each, four by 16, it adds up.

880
01:08:56,795 --> 01:08:58,816
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the kinds of things that fees go toward.

881
01:08:59,156 --> 01:09:01,678
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I think people need to hear.

882
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:02,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that.

883
01:09:02,879 --> 01:09:03,559
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that.

884
01:09:04,139 --> 01:09:06,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody else have a question for a current gardener?

885
01:09:06,021 --> 01:09:06,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

886
01:09:06,281 --> 01:09:06,661
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good.

887
01:09:07,562 --> 01:09:07,722
[SPEAKER_01]: No?

888
01:09:08,342 --> 01:09:08,402
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

889
01:09:08,762 --> 01:09:09,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

890
01:09:09,823 --> 01:09:10,964
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

891
01:09:11,504 --> 01:09:11,704
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.

892
01:09:11,744 --> 01:09:13,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

893
01:09:13,545 --> 01:09:14,705
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Michael Ruggiero.

894
01:09:14,725 --> 01:09:16,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

895
01:09:17,546 --> 01:09:19,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to speak to one item.

896
01:09:19,687 --> 01:09:22,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is an overall a great idea.

897
01:09:22,068 --> 01:09:26,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I commend the mayor's office and the community garden group that have done some great work.

898
01:09:27,349 --> 01:09:36,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish to draw your attention to section 2 slash 552 subsection A. All these commissioners are going to be appointed by the mayor.

899
01:09:37,252 --> 01:09:43,254
[SPEAKER_02]: This might work out great now that we have a current mayor that works collegiately with these groups.

900
01:09:43,825 --> 01:09:46,806
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this might not always be the case in the future.

901
01:09:47,446 --> 01:09:53,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I suggest that these members are elected directly from the community gardeners themselves.

902
01:09:54,729 --> 01:10:05,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that one person might need to be brought in from the mayor's office to make sure that there is a line of communication between the mayor's office and these groups.

903
01:10:06,314 --> 01:10:12,457
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it is a mistake to have all five commissioners directly appointed by the mayor.

904
01:10:13,975 --> 01:10:21,060
[SPEAKER_02]: would be that perhaps there would be in the future a mayor who is not as interested in community gardening as this current administration.

905
01:10:21,541 --> 01:10:25,744
[SPEAKER_02]: So I urge that you consider that four of these members are elected at large.

906
01:10:25,824 --> 01:10:28,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I've taken a brief sample of the members here.

907
01:10:28,846 --> 01:10:31,648
[SPEAKER_02]: They do support this idea as of my conversation.

908
01:10:31,668 --> 01:10:32,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you not support?

909
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:37,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you don't like the idea that you elect people directly?

910
01:10:37,102 --> 01:10:37,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

911
01:10:45,948 --> 01:10:47,249
[SPEAKER_02]: You think that's enough, the three?

912
01:10:51,993 --> 01:10:55,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm confused because I just spoke with the city solicitor.

913
01:10:55,495 --> 01:10:57,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps there's a miscommunication on my end.

914
01:10:57,157 --> 01:10:59,558
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is, I withdraw any sort of objection.

915
01:11:00,099 --> 01:11:02,681
[SPEAKER_02]: The solicitor said that these five people are

916
01:11:03,802 --> 01:11:05,302
[SPEAKER_02]: appointed by the mayor as of now.

917
01:11:05,342 --> 01:11:06,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct or not?

918
01:11:07,483 --> 01:11:09,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

919
01:11:09,503 --> 01:11:16,425
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's very important to point out that this was a citizen driven initiative and that the text of the amendment actually wasn't written at the hand of the solicitor.

920
01:11:16,485 --> 01:11:20,286
[SPEAKER_13]: It was written at the hand of the people that are actually looking to create the commission.

921
01:11:20,706 --> 01:11:26,307
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it would be important for us to support their wishes and what they see is going to work.

922
01:11:26,887 --> 01:11:29,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, you know, I certainly think it's a great ordinance.

923
01:11:29,568 --> 01:11:30,828
[SPEAKER_13]: I've said it three or four times tonight.

924
01:11:31,618 --> 01:11:33,339
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, this is what the people are looking for.

925
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:35,841
[SPEAKER_13]: This is what they put forward to us, and this is what they're asking us to vote on.

926
01:11:36,601 --> 01:11:43,245
[SPEAKER_13]: With the exception of a couple of items, Mr. President, you know, I can't find a good reason to vote against it.

927
01:11:43,345 --> 01:11:48,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Legislatively, I just want to clarify, as of right now— Thank you, Counsel, and I— Sir.

928
01:11:49,688 --> 01:11:50,629
[SPEAKER_18]: The Counsel is speaking.

929
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:53,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you all set, Counsel?

930
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:55,331
[SPEAKER_13]: I think so at this point in time, Mr. President.

931
01:11:55,371 --> 01:11:55,992
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you know,

932
01:11:57,462 --> 01:11:58,583
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said, it's a good idea.

933
01:11:58,663 --> 01:12:00,684
[SPEAKER_13]: It's something that I think we should take to a vote.

934
01:12:00,724 --> 01:12:02,485
[SPEAKER_13]: We've all looked into it.

935
01:12:02,545 --> 01:12:03,365
[SPEAKER_13]: We've all reviewed it.

936
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:04,306
[SPEAKER_13]: We've all done our homework.

937
01:12:04,346 --> 01:12:07,468
[SPEAKER_13]: We've all, you know, spoke about what amendments we'd like to see fit.

938
01:12:08,008 --> 01:12:12,971
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd certainly like to hear from some more people that are either in favor or against it to see where they stand.

939
01:12:13,011 --> 01:12:15,652
[SPEAKER_13]: But ultimately, Mr. President, the community gardens are coming.

940
01:12:15,692 --> 01:12:16,272
[SPEAKER_13]: They're here already.

941
01:12:16,653 --> 01:12:17,653
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we need to govern them.

942
01:12:17,673 --> 01:12:18,474
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to regulate them.

943
01:12:18,514 --> 01:12:22,576
[SPEAKER_13]: And we need to be sure that there's a fair, open, and transparent process for these people who want to get a plot.

944
01:12:23,036 --> 01:12:24,757
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that this ordinance meets those goals.

945
01:12:27,815 --> 01:12:32,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair and open means that the people of the garden control the commissioners that apply.

946
01:12:33,297 --> 01:12:38,358
[SPEAKER_02]: As of right now, unamended, these five commissioners will be appointed directly by the mayor's office.

947
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:47,101
[SPEAKER_02]: That is something that we need to consider if there is a mayor that comes in later who is not as excited about this community garden commission.

948
01:12:48,581 --> 01:12:50,322
[SPEAKER_32]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

949
01:12:50,782 --> 01:12:54,443
[SPEAKER_32]: What the candidate for office fails to recognize is this is still public property.

950
01:12:54,993 --> 01:12:56,054
[SPEAKER_32]: And this was citizen-driven.

951
01:12:56,454 --> 01:12:59,596
[SPEAKER_32]: This is public property that the mayor is responsible for.

952
01:12:59,616 --> 01:13:04,359
[SPEAKER_32]: If someone falls in that garden, they're not going to the five members of the board.

953
01:13:04,679 --> 01:13:06,200
[SPEAKER_32]: They're going to see Mark Rumley for a suit.

954
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,381
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very important to remember that.

955
01:13:08,901 --> 01:13:11,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Without this commission now, they're still going to speak to Mark Rumley.

956
01:13:12,123 --> 01:13:14,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there another call for a point of information, Councilor Knight?

957
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:18,387
[SPEAKER_32]: Without this commission, without this commission,

958
01:13:18,972 --> 01:13:23,994
[SPEAKER_32]: There's no rules in place to make sure that there's fair and equitable access to the gardens.

959
01:13:24,314 --> 01:13:25,714
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, the city has a stake at it.

960
01:13:26,194 --> 01:13:31,136
[SPEAKER_32]: If someone doesn't feel they're being fairly treated, they can go down here and see Diane McLeod.

961
01:13:31,356 --> 01:13:32,277
[SPEAKER_32]: This is fairly simple.

962
01:13:32,417 --> 01:13:34,697
[SPEAKER_32]: This is something good for our community, Mr. President.

963
01:13:35,498 --> 01:13:36,778
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for that point of information.

964
01:13:36,838 --> 01:13:38,159
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

965
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:47,802
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's also important to point out that the ordinance was already amended by the council to reflect that there would be a council rep and a garden rep as members of the five-member commission.

966
01:13:50,763 --> 01:13:51,644
[SPEAKER_18]: Sir, you may continue.

967
01:13:53,225 --> 01:14:02,672
[SPEAKER_02]: The issue is not a simple binary one, where to speak, to improve this provision, what we have before us, is not simply to shoot it down.

968
01:14:03,112 --> 01:14:04,573
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great idea.

969
01:14:04,593 --> 01:14:05,894
[SPEAKER_02]: It should happen.

970
01:14:06,374 --> 01:14:07,855
[SPEAKER_02]: These people are doing great work.

971
01:14:08,276 --> 01:14:10,818
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is, how do we protect them adequately?

972
01:14:11,158 --> 01:14:11,998
[SPEAKER_02]: That is my only point.

973
01:14:12,279 --> 01:14:12,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

974
01:14:15,941 --> 01:14:16,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.

975
01:14:16,442 --> 01:14:18,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Please state your name and address for the record.

976
01:14:19,911 --> 01:14:21,292
[SPEAKER_03]: My name's Alexander Panchich.

977
01:14:21,712 --> 01:14:23,834
[SPEAKER_03]: I live at 12 Cushing Street in Medford.

978
01:14:24,435 --> 01:14:27,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a member of the Mystic Riverbend Community Garden.

979
01:14:27,777 --> 01:14:36,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I was hearing questions floating around about them, I felt it was my duty to come up and speak about it.

980
01:14:36,524 --> 01:14:42,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Also to speak about the idea that why we would like to remain independent.

981
01:14:43,009 --> 01:14:45,871
[SPEAKER_03]: There are different ways of running community gardens.

982
01:14:46,092 --> 01:14:46,952
[SPEAKER_03]: There's many different

983
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:48,890
[SPEAKER_03]: ways of doing it.

984
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:50,411
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have a victory garden.

985
01:14:50,471 --> 01:14:56,954
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have a garden where all the members are working together for one whole harvest.

986
01:14:57,255 --> 01:15:02,637
[SPEAKER_03]: You can run it as a sort of adjunct to a park where you can have the public moving through it.

987
01:15:02,657 --> 01:15:02,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So

988
01:15:04,372 --> 01:15:07,714
[SPEAKER_03]: What we've done at Mystic Riverbend Garden has worked for 12 years.

989
01:15:08,034 --> 01:15:09,314
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worked very well.

990
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:14,717
[SPEAKER_03]: People are on waiting lists, and the waiting list changes.

991
01:15:14,757 --> 01:15:16,438
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had four new people this year.

992
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:27,123
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't move that fast, and we also respect the soil that we have spent so much time cultivating and adding to.

993
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:33,926
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't agree completely with the way that other people might want to run their gardens.

994
01:15:34,606 --> 01:15:43,689
[SPEAKER_03]: And since ours has worked so well for so long and is transparent in the way that it operates, there's no secret society, there's no secret meetings.

995
01:15:45,109 --> 01:15:50,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone is very welcome to come down and come to our meetings or even just come down to the garden itself.

996
01:15:52,692 --> 01:15:57,533
[SPEAKER_03]: As they've mentioned, we've been very open with how we run things.

997
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:02,215
[SPEAKER_03]: They come to us for advice, come to us to see how we've managed it,

998
01:16:02,631 --> 01:16:10,655
[SPEAKER_03]: come to us to see what works, what doesn't work, and come to us to see how we put our own effort into the day-to-day operation of it.

999
01:16:12,215 --> 01:16:24,901
[SPEAKER_03]: But come back and say, okay, now that you've run it real well for 12 years, we want you to run it this way instead, because we're trying an experiment, I don't think is a very good idea.

1000
01:16:25,281 --> 01:16:29,423
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the reasons why we would like to remain independent, because we have been successful.

1001
01:16:30,004 --> 01:16:30,704
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we weren't,

1002
01:16:31,708 --> 01:16:32,648
[SPEAKER_03]: we would be looking for help.

1003
01:16:34,369 --> 01:16:40,671
[SPEAKER_03]: If you had, I think, Councilor Marks, you had a question about the community garden.

1004
01:16:40,871 --> 01:16:42,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost my place and I can't remember what it was.

1005
01:16:53,494 --> 01:16:53,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1006
01:16:53,995 --> 01:16:55,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe they were answered all.

1007
01:16:55,335 --> 01:16:55,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1008
01:16:56,535 --> 01:16:57,416
[SPEAKER_03]: So there, yeah.

1009
01:16:57,536 --> 01:16:58,756
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way the waiting list moves,

1010
01:16:59,851 --> 01:17:05,112
[SPEAKER_03]: at Riverbend, we actually started out with the idea that we would have three plots for the school.

1011
01:17:06,713 --> 01:17:15,074
[SPEAKER_03]: The school wasn't that interested in them, so we scaled it back to one plot, because only one teacher wanted to use it, and then we gave those away.

1012
01:17:15,134 --> 01:17:23,096
[SPEAKER_03]: We can split plots, we can do a lot of different things, but we can do that because we have that independence.

1013
01:17:23,636 --> 01:17:25,697
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've put 12 years of money, 12 years of effort,

1014
01:17:28,238 --> 01:17:39,281
[SPEAKER_03]: 12 years, and I do believe, and I feel I can speak fairly well for everyone in the garden, that we are basically the definition of being grandfathered.

1015
01:17:39,701 --> 01:17:40,621
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done this for a while.

1016
01:17:43,862 --> 01:17:44,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1017
01:17:45,662 --> 01:17:51,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we vote on this tonight, if the members aren't happy with these terms, would they speak up on it now?

1018
01:17:51,224 --> 01:17:54,204
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, you are happy with these terms?

1019
01:17:54,304 --> 01:17:57,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make sure.

1020
01:17:57,967 --> 01:17:59,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1021
01:18:00,149 --> 01:18:03,111
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have no objection to the amendments that are presented.

1022
01:18:03,131 --> 01:18:05,293
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all right.

1023
01:18:05,493 --> 01:18:05,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1024
01:18:10,216 --> 01:18:10,457
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

1025
01:18:10,617 --> 01:18:12,819
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, I want to thank Mr. Patience.

1026
01:18:12,879 --> 01:18:18,143
[SPEAKER_32]: Is it Patrick for coming up, but, uh, I'm going to keep the amendment there, I think 36 months.

1027
01:18:18,883 --> 01:18:23,187
[SPEAKER_32]: Uh, and quite honestly, if this doesn't work in 36 months, the audience is going to be out the window.

1028
01:18:23,227 --> 01:18:27,510
[SPEAKER_32]: So it's not going to, it will be moved and you guys will still operate your garden off to the side.

1029
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:33,374
[SPEAKER_32]: So like I said, I just think it's the equity that has to be done.

1030
01:18:33,415 --> 01:18:41,781
[SPEAKER_32]: And like I said, I cannot appreciate Mr. Lasky and his group, what they've done up to this point, because it wouldn't be realistic.

1031
01:18:42,242 --> 01:18:48,647
[SPEAKER_32]: But I don't even remember starting a revolving account for Riverbend Park way back when, when it started.

1032
01:18:50,937 --> 01:18:55,138
[SPEAKER_32]: There's not even public records as far as how much money comes in and out and stuff.

1033
01:18:55,438 --> 01:18:58,619
[SPEAKER_32]: I just think that 36 months is enough.

1034
01:18:58,839 --> 01:19:02,960
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll even, for the gentleman's sake, I'll even go out 48 months.

1035
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,421
[SPEAKER_32]: Give them four years.

1036
01:19:04,561 --> 01:19:08,002
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that's more than reasonable until it all becomes one.

1037
01:19:09,722 --> 01:19:11,443
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're changing your amendment to 48 months?

1038
01:19:11,883 --> 01:19:14,403
[SPEAKER_32]: If the council, 48 months.

1039
01:19:15,284 --> 01:19:15,884
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I'll do that.

1040
01:19:15,924 --> 01:19:20,365
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll withdraw the 36 months and 48 months, which is four years from the date of its passage,

1041
01:19:26,019 --> 01:19:38,648
[SPEAKER_32]: It comes down to equity, I mean, and you can't have different organizations running different public properties when it all falls under similar data.

1042
01:19:39,668 --> 01:19:44,472
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe the city solicitor can be helpful on all of this.

1043
01:19:48,628 --> 01:19:50,849
[SPEAKER_18]: We have several amendments on an ordinance.

1044
01:19:51,650 --> 01:20:10,762
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, if the solicitor could advise the council on a, uh, uh, with all due respects on a way to handle those, um, amendments, uh, can we take them, uh, as collectively, uh, we need to have them read back to us too, uh, before we vote on them or should we take them separately?

1045
01:20:11,382 --> 01:20:14,605
[SPEAKER_24]: I would suggest reverse chronological order.

1046
01:20:15,245 --> 01:20:16,826
[SPEAKER_24]: Take councilor Camusos first.

1047
01:20:17,667 --> 01:20:20,988
[SPEAKER_24]: and then the other one's going down the line earlier.

1048
01:20:21,028 --> 01:20:37,335
[SPEAKER_24]: The first, because the first, if his proposed amendment is taken first, then that will, one way or the other, the recommendation before you is that the Riverbend Garden be exempted.

1049
01:20:38,156 --> 01:20:39,836
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Camuso takes a different view.

1050
01:20:39,856 --> 01:20:46,239
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that's a good place to start and to take these singularly because I think in total there are only three or four.

1051
01:20:47,889 --> 01:20:48,909
[SPEAKER_32]: I respectfully disagree.

1052
01:20:48,929 --> 01:20:51,511
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't think this is a legal decision, as the city solicitor stated.

1053
01:20:51,932 --> 01:20:57,336
[SPEAKER_32]: In the past, this is more of a parliamentary procedure, which would fall under the domain of the president of the council.

1054
01:20:57,576 --> 01:20:58,777
[SPEAKER_24]: You're absolutely correct.

1055
01:20:58,817 --> 01:21:05,142
[SPEAKER_32]: The motion of Councilor Lungo-Koehn... No, you didn't answer that in the past.

1056
01:21:05,222 --> 01:21:08,065
[SPEAKER_32]: In the past, clearly because this is the mayor's paper you're answering.

1057
01:21:08,845 --> 01:21:09,386
[SPEAKER_18]: Nonsense.

1058
01:21:10,507 --> 01:21:13,269
[SPEAKER_18]: The chair recognizes Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1059
01:21:16,564 --> 01:21:17,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to sever the amendments.

1060
01:21:18,305 --> 01:21:21,486
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of Councilor Lungo-Koehn, that all amendments be severed.

1061
01:21:21,506 --> 01:21:22,066
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President.

1062
01:21:22,306 --> 01:21:22,947
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks.

1063
01:21:23,667 --> 01:21:25,788
[SPEAKER_25]: Just if I could, because I agree on all this.

1064
01:21:26,988 --> 01:21:35,771
[SPEAKER_25]: If the Riverbend group wants to stay separate right now at this particular point, there is no animosity among the groups.

1065
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:38,092
[SPEAKER_25]: The friends are fine with that.

1066
01:21:39,153 --> 01:21:39,973
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't see this.

1067
01:21:40,053 --> 01:21:45,015
[SPEAKER_25]: The city is not supporting the Riverbend and they're not supporting

1068
01:21:45,835 --> 01:21:54,302
[SPEAKER_25]: the friends other than allowing to use city land, then I don't see this disparity that one speaks about.

1069
01:21:55,463 --> 01:21:58,105
[SPEAKER_25]: And I see it as different organizations.

1070
01:21:58,165 --> 01:22:00,747
[SPEAKER_25]: We have little leagues that are different in the city.

1071
01:22:00,847 --> 01:22:03,309
[SPEAKER_25]: We have football leagues that are different in the city.

1072
01:22:03,950 --> 01:22:06,191
[SPEAKER_25]: And I don't see this as any different for now.

1073
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:08,974
[SPEAKER_25]: And maybe someday they'll join together.

1074
01:22:10,215 --> 01:22:12,997
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would support leaving it as is.

1075
01:22:13,097 --> 01:22:14,418
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't support right now.

1076
01:22:15,322 --> 01:22:18,785
[SPEAKER_25]: the amendment that Councilor Camuso put forward.

1077
01:22:19,065 --> 01:22:31,473
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it has some valid points, but at this particular time, there's no one in opposition, and I don't see why I'm going to create opposition when there seems to be harmony among the group.

1078
01:22:32,434 --> 01:22:34,976
[SPEAKER_25]: So I just want to go on record, Mr. President.

1079
01:22:35,076 --> 01:22:38,558
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of Vice President Lago-Curran to sever the amendments.

1080
01:22:38,618 --> 01:22:39,379
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

1081
01:22:39,739 --> 01:22:39,859
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

1082
01:22:39,999 --> 01:22:40,720
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

1083
01:22:41,884 --> 01:22:42,584
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion carries.

1084
01:22:42,604 --> 01:22:54,631
[SPEAKER_18]: So the first one then, uh, was the amendment offered by councilor Camuso, uh, that, uh, that in section, uh, go ahead.

1085
01:22:54,752 --> 01:22:55,312
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1086
01:22:56,052 --> 01:22:58,354
[SPEAKER_18]: So, so the, the amendment before us,

1087
01:23:09,768 --> 01:23:14,743
[SPEAKER_18]: is to exempt Riverbend Park for a period of 48 months.

1088
01:23:17,754 --> 01:23:19,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of clarification, Councilor Knight.

1089
01:23:19,315 --> 01:23:20,195
[SPEAKER_13]: We have two amendments.

1090
01:23:20,255 --> 01:23:26,459
[SPEAKER_13]: We have an amendment that I put forward at the suggestion of the solicitor, which would be to exempt Riverbend Park exclusively from the ordinance.

1091
01:23:27,019 --> 01:23:33,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we have Councilor Camuso's contradictory amendment that would exempt Riverbend Park only for a defined period of time.

1092
01:23:34,023 --> 01:23:34,163
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1093
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:41,047
[SPEAKER_16]: So what we're voting on now is the amendment offered by Councilor Camuso to exempt Riverbend Park

1094
01:23:41,647 --> 01:23:49,052
[SPEAKER_16]: for 48 months, at which time it would follow under the purview of this Metro Community Garden Commission.

1095
01:23:49,672 --> 01:23:56,816
[SPEAKER_18]: So on the motion of amendment by Councilor Camuso, a roll call vote has been requested.

1096
01:23:58,417 --> 01:24:03,300
[SPEAKER_18]: A yes would be to approve Councilor Camuso's amendment.

1097
01:24:03,701 --> 01:24:08,023
[SPEAKER_18]: A no would be to vote contrary to that amendment.

1098
01:24:09,404 --> 01:24:10,164
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Camuso.

1099
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:10,745
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1100
01:24:11,785 --> 01:24:12,686
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Caraviello?

1101
01:24:12,766 --> 01:24:12,966
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1102
01:24:14,087 --> 01:24:14,707
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight?

1103
01:24:14,807 --> 01:24:15,027
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1104
01:24:15,828 --> 01:24:16,949
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn?

1105
01:24:17,049 --> 01:24:17,229
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1106
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:18,810
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks?

1107
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:19,310
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1108
01:24:20,131 --> 01:24:20,972
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Penta?

1109
01:24:21,112 --> 01:24:21,352
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1110
01:24:22,273 --> 01:24:23,173
[SPEAKER_19]: President Dello Russo?

1111
01:24:23,393 --> 01:24:23,654
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1112
01:24:23,834 --> 01:24:28,417
[SPEAKER_18]: A vote of six in the negative, one in the affirmative.

1113
01:24:28,917 --> 01:24:29,798
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion fails.

1114
01:24:31,959 --> 01:24:36,122
[SPEAKER_18]: The next amendment that was offered was the one.

1115
01:24:37,383 --> 01:24:39,365
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we're taking them, uh,

1116
01:24:40,225 --> 01:24:43,126
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we can do it this way then, and work it down.

1117
01:24:43,226 --> 01:25:02,473
[SPEAKER_18]: So, section 2550, to exempt specific, what was suggested in the language is after the city of Medford, with the specific exemption of the community garden presently existing at Riverbend Park.

1118
01:25:03,053 --> 01:25:06,254
[SPEAKER_18]: So for that amendment, which was offered by Councilor Knight,

1119
01:25:07,428 --> 01:25:08,368
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

1120
01:25:08,588 --> 01:25:08,668
[SPEAKER_32]: Aye.

1121
01:25:08,808 --> 01:25:27,313
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. President, if I may, I know my resolution failed, but at this point, I'm going to, in the interest of having a unanimous vote for something good in our community, I'm going to vote with the rest of my council colleagues to include the language amended by the city solicitor, presented before the body by Councilor Knight.

1122
01:25:28,433 --> 01:25:30,014
[SPEAKER_32]: If the record could reflect that.

1123
01:25:30,034 --> 01:25:30,294
[SPEAKER_32]: It will.

1124
01:25:30,654 --> 01:25:31,654
[SPEAKER_32]: So all those in favor?

1125
01:25:32,054 --> 01:25:32,394
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

1126
01:25:32,774 --> 01:25:33,594
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

1127
01:25:34,515 --> 01:25:35,835
[SPEAKER_18]: So that amendment passes.

1128
01:25:36,551 --> 01:25:42,433
[SPEAKER_18]: The next amendment was in section 2, 552, members in terms.

1129
01:25:43,174 --> 01:26:05,403
[SPEAKER_18]: The recommendation of councillors Lungo-Koehn, and Penta was that of the five members, the five members of the commission, the mayor has the right of appointment of three, one comes

1130
01:26:06,190 --> 01:26:15,373
[SPEAKER_18]: appointed by the City Council and one appointed by the membership of the Community Garden Executive Committee, was it or?

1131
01:26:16,073 --> 01:26:17,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Membership.

1132
01:26:17,573 --> 01:26:18,013
[SPEAKER_16]: Membership.

1133
01:26:18,834 --> 01:26:22,035
[SPEAKER_18]: So on that amendment, all those in favor?

1134
01:26:22,395 --> 01:26:22,775
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

1135
01:26:23,655 --> 01:26:24,535
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

1136
01:26:25,916 --> 01:26:26,816
[SPEAKER_18]: The amendment carries.

1137
01:26:28,418 --> 01:26:29,559
[SPEAKER_18]: Did we have one more amendment?

1138
01:26:29,699 --> 01:26:30,599
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1139
01:26:30,659 --> 01:26:45,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it had to do with the fiscal year report to- That was offered by- Yeah, that the annual report include the language, mayor, Office of Environment and Energy, and to the Medford City Council.

1140
01:26:45,789 --> 01:26:47,490
[SPEAKER_16]: So that the language

1141
01:26:48,127 --> 01:26:56,652
[SPEAKER_16]: include that the annual report be presented to the Mayor, Office of Environment and Energy, and the Metro City Council.

1142
01:26:56,792 --> 01:26:58,052
[SPEAKER_19]: Was that by fiscal year?

1143
01:27:00,794 --> 01:27:04,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, at the end of the fiscal year, with that language we put in there, so we know when.

1144
01:27:04,396 --> 01:27:05,756
[SPEAKER_16]: At the end of the fiscal year.

1145
01:27:05,776 --> 01:27:06,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Striking December?

1146
01:27:07,217 --> 01:27:10,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Striking December?

1147
01:27:10,539 --> 01:27:12,440
[SPEAKER_10]: No, sorry, no, we're not changing the time frame.

1148
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:16,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Just adding that it be presented to the Office of Energy and Environment.

1149
01:27:18,354 --> 01:27:30,123
[SPEAKER_18]: She's clarifying it, and it should be not changing the time frame, but that the Office of Energy and Environment be included into those receiving the annual report.

1150
01:27:33,246 --> 01:27:34,947
[SPEAKER_18]: On that amendment, all those in favor?

1151
01:27:36,322 --> 01:27:37,263
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

1152
01:27:38,003 --> 01:27:39,084

[SPEAKER_18]: Is this a,

1159
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:06,812

[SPEAKER_16]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight to waive all three readings.

[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Penta?

01:28:27,846 --> 01:28:28,086
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1177
01:28:28,566 --> 01:28:29,287
[SPEAKER_19]: President Dello Russo?

1178
01:28:29,607 --> 01:28:29,907
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1179
01:28:30,548 --> 01:28:32,229
[SPEAKER_19]: We get Vice President Langley-Kern?

1180
01:28:33,029 --> 01:28:33,149
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1181
01:28:34,326 --> 01:28:34,486
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1182
01:28:35,787 --> 01:28:38,048
[SPEAKER_18]: Seven in the affirmative, none naked, negative.

1183
01:28:38,509 --> 01:28:40,710
[SPEAKER_18]: The ordinance passes.

1184
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:41,431
[SPEAKER_18]: Congratulations.

1185
01:28:43,212 --> 01:28:45,633
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, we'll run to suspension.

1186
01:28:45,713 --> 01:28:48,375
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, we'll run to suspension.

1187
01:28:48,415 --> 01:28:52,758
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll take the financial paper attached to this, if we could.

1188
01:28:53,235 --> 01:29:06,040
[SPEAKER_18]: So on 15-619, to the President, to members of the Medford City Council, from Mayor McGlynn, regarding the establishment of a revolving account for the Medford Community Guiding Commission.

1189
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:22,666
[SPEAKER_18]: Dear Mr. President, to members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approve the establishment of a revolving account under General Laws, Chapter 44, Paragraph 53E and a half, to serve the Medford Community Guiding Commission with the following provisions.

1190
01:29:23,390 --> 01:29:31,716
[SPEAKER_18]: One, the fees received from the community garden members or plot holders, along with any donations, will be deposited into the revolving account.

1191
01:29:32,257 --> 01:29:42,804
[SPEAKER_18]: Two, the revolving account will provide a source for the payment of expenses related to the community gardens for items such as, but not limited to, equipment, supplies, and maintenance.

1192
01:29:42,964 --> 01:29:51,771
[SPEAKER_18]: Three, the director of the Office of Energy and Environment shall have the authority, in accordance with all applicable law,

1193
01:29:52,359 --> 01:29:54,763
[SPEAKER_18]: to approve expenditures from the revolving account.

1194
01:29:55,364 --> 01:30:06,661
[SPEAKER_18]: Four, the total amount of annual expenditures from the revolving account shall be limited to $10,000, but in any event, expenditures shall not exceed the balance of the account.

1195
01:30:07,185 --> 01:30:18,175
[SPEAKER_18]: And five, the Director of the Office of Energy and Environment shall annually prepare a report disclosing all deposits and expenditures from the revolving account for the current fiscal year.

1196
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:22,218
[SPEAKER_18]: Respectfully submitted, Michael J. McGlynn, Mayor, etc.

1197
01:30:22,759 --> 01:30:24,080
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Lungelkirch.

1198
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:24,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1199
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:28,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Just what we spoke about earlier, number five, that we just add.

1200
01:30:31,492 --> 01:30:34,533
[SPEAKER_10]: to the end to the mayor and the city council.

1201
01:30:34,753 --> 01:30:44,455
[SPEAKER_18]: So, uh, amending, uh, uh, paragraph number five to include, uh, the mayor and city council in that report, uh, as amended.

1202
01:30:44,475 --> 01:30:47,695
[SPEAKER_18]: Did anybody else want to offer amendments?

1203
01:30:47,875 --> 01:30:49,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, two questions.

1204
01:30:50,156 --> 01:30:53,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, number three says the director of office of energy environment.

1205
01:30:54,377 --> 01:30:59,638
[SPEAKER_09]: And since this is all on Parkland, is there any reason why this is not coming under the park board commission?

1206
01:31:00,132 --> 01:31:02,634
[SPEAKER_09]: rather than the Office of Energy and Environment?

1207
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:07,338
[SPEAKER_24]: All parks are under the jurisdiction of the Park Board, you're quite correct.

1208
01:31:08,999 --> 01:31:15,664
[SPEAKER_24]: This would specifically be Office of Energy and Environment, which has had a relationship with the people involved in community gardens from the beginning.

1209
01:31:16,725 --> 01:31:27,613
[SPEAKER_24]: But, and also it would be a bit, there's a practical reason too, because the director of the Office of Community Development is a municipal employee in the fullest sense,

1210
01:31:28,057 --> 01:31:34,340
[SPEAKER_24]: And if we would have expenditures approved by the park board, we'd be waiting for their monthly meetings anyway.

1211
01:31:35,101 --> 01:31:36,101
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's a little bit different.

1212
01:31:36,501 --> 01:31:41,784
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's more convenient and it still has to be done in accordance with all municipal finance law, et cetera.

1213
01:31:42,044 --> 01:31:43,545
[SPEAKER_24]: And under the auditor too.

1214
01:31:43,785 --> 01:31:49,128
[SPEAKER_09]: And the second part of number three, it said she'll have the authority in accordance with all.

1215
01:31:49,168 --> 01:31:57,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that mean that that individual, whoever he or she might be, can refuse a vote of the commission to make an expenditure?

1216
01:31:59,586 --> 01:32:03,128
[SPEAKER_24]: If the expenditure were related to the community guidance, the answer would be no.

1217
01:32:03,389 --> 01:32:07,932
[SPEAKER_09]: But it says here, the director of the Office of Energy and Environment shall have the authority to approve.

1218
01:32:08,072 --> 01:32:09,813
[SPEAKER_24]: In accordance with our applicable law.

1219
01:32:09,833 --> 01:32:10,233
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

1220
01:32:10,253 --> 01:32:13,315
[SPEAKER_24]: And you've just passed the first set of laws which are approved locally.

1221
01:32:13,355 --> 01:32:14,096
[SPEAKER_09]: But I understand that.

1222
01:32:14,136 --> 01:32:15,457
[SPEAKER_09]: It says to approve expenditures.

1223
01:32:15,517 --> 01:32:24,483
[SPEAKER_09]: And if that individual, now or in the future, does not feel that the expenditures are warranted, wouldn't that be in contravention to the commission?

1224
01:32:24,943 --> 01:32:26,985
[SPEAKER_24]: It certainly would be in contravention to the commission.

1225
01:32:27,005 --> 01:32:28,646
[SPEAKER_24]: And I bet that it would start quite

1226
01:32:29,733 --> 01:32:30,614
[SPEAKER_24]: quite a controversy.

1227
01:32:30,654 --> 01:32:31,534
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's give an example.

1228
01:32:31,895 --> 01:32:41,821
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's say that $1,000 worth of, and forgive me, specialized soil had to be purchased, and then the Director of Energy and Environment said, no, we're not spending it.

1229
01:32:42,202 --> 01:32:47,665
[SPEAKER_24]: But yet the Commission said that this is the latest thing in compact gardening.

1230
01:32:47,705 --> 01:32:51,328
[SPEAKER_24]: We need to have that, and we approve it, and it's part of gardening.

1231
01:32:51,688 --> 01:32:54,270
[SPEAKER_24]: It would certainly create a controversy, which I'm sure would

1232
01:32:54,626 --> 01:33:02,671
[SPEAKER_24]: quickly rise to, at very least, the level of department head level in the city and maybe get to the council or to the then mayor.

1233
01:33:03,012 --> 01:33:04,092
[SPEAKER_24]: It would have to be resolved.

1234
01:33:04,132 --> 01:33:17,481
[SPEAKER_24]: But the final resolution, by the way, as you know from the past, would be the auditor, the finance auditor director, has the final authority to approve or to disapprove expenditures in accordance with municipal finance law.

1235
01:33:18,201 --> 01:33:21,464
[SPEAKER_09]: But if this is just a matter of personal choice, that's what I'm concerned about.

1236
01:33:21,484 --> 01:33:23,565
[SPEAKER_24]: If there were an arbitrary personal decision

1237
01:33:23,995 --> 01:33:29,501
[SPEAKER_24]: And the director of the Office of Energy and Environment said, I don't want you to spend it on that.

1238
01:33:29,821 --> 01:33:37,088
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd rather that you spent on ABC Corporation's product as opposed to DEF Corporation product.

1239
01:33:37,429 --> 01:33:39,010
[SPEAKER_24]: That, to me, would be arbitrary.

1240
01:33:39,331 --> 01:33:40,612
[SPEAKER_09]: So who makes that final decision?

1241
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:51,184
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, the initial one to make the approval would be the Office of Energy and Environment, but there are ways internally that things do get arbitrated, so to speak, to use that word loosely.

1242
01:33:51,544 --> 01:33:57,926
[SPEAKER_24]: And that would be through finance auditing, and sometimes it gets to me for an interpretation.

1243
01:33:58,907 --> 01:34:00,187
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion for approval, Mr. President.

1244
01:34:00,377 --> 01:34:04,842
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Marx, Councilor Knight.

1245
01:34:05,483 --> 01:34:12,932
[SPEAKER_13]: In building upon what Councilor Lungo amended, I'd also like to see a copy of the annual report sent to the people that actually hold the plot.

1246
01:34:14,192 --> 01:34:19,335
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that that might be very helpful to them to see the success of a growing community garden and the success in the community.

1247
01:34:19,936 --> 01:34:24,239
[SPEAKER_13]: If I had a plot and I was out there working every day, I'd like to get a copy of the annual report as well.

1248
01:34:24,279 --> 01:34:30,883
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe we can make that a part of the requirement, Mr. President, that it goes to the mayor, the council, and as well as those that are fortunate enough to be selected to have a plot.

1249
01:34:31,363 --> 01:34:31,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

1250
01:34:31,863 --> 01:34:37,227
[SPEAKER_18]: So on the motion of approval by Councilor Marks as amended by Councilor Lango-Kern and Councilor Knight.

1251
01:34:38,056 --> 01:34:39,477
[SPEAKER_18]: Sir, you wish to speak on this matter.

1252
01:34:39,577 --> 01:34:42,320
[SPEAKER_18]: Welcome, and please state your name and address for the record, Senator.

1253
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:44,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1254
01:34:44,061 --> 01:34:46,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Robert Capucci of 71 Evans Street.

1255
01:34:47,724 --> 01:34:48,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1256
01:34:48,165 --> 01:34:51,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have a few questions.

1257
01:34:55,131 --> 01:35:05,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Could it be possible that all parks in Medford are, by the request of the council, looked at for possible

1258
01:35:06,153 --> 01:35:11,937
[SPEAKER_07]: other venues for something like this, because I know I might be speaking out of turn.

1259
01:35:12,217 --> 01:35:26,187
[SPEAKER_07]: There might be works in the process that I don't know about, but my park, Morrison Park on Central Ave, this might be out of turn of the topic, but it's out of disarray.

1260
01:35:29,246 --> 01:35:31,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe this is a matter for the questions I have.

1261
01:35:31,787 --> 01:35:34,227
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that Morrison Park is falling apart.

1262
01:35:34,367 --> 01:35:37,108
[SPEAKER_07]: The tennis court has huge cracks in it.

1263
01:35:37,128 --> 01:35:38,928
[SPEAKER_07]: There's grass growing up between it.

1264
01:35:39,268 --> 01:35:40,549
[SPEAKER_07]: The basketball court as well.

1265
01:35:40,589 --> 01:35:42,529
[SPEAKER_07]: There are fences falling apart.

1266
01:35:42,709 --> 01:35:43,870
[SPEAKER_07]: And I might be speaking out of turn.

1267
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:45,390
[SPEAKER_07]: The Parks Department might have this.

1268
01:35:45,850 --> 01:35:53,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe as a part of this, I don't know if you could have like all parks looked at since this gardening was brought up.

1269
01:35:53,552 --> 01:35:54,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1270
01:35:54,232 --> 01:35:55,112
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. Cappucci.

1271
01:35:55,412 --> 01:35:57,573
[SPEAKER_18]: So on the motion for approval, all those in favor?

1272
01:35:58,513 --> 01:36:00,414
[SPEAKER_25]: Just if I could, Mr. President.

1273
01:36:00,454 --> 01:36:02,495
[SPEAKER_25]: Because the gentleman brings up a very valid point.

1274
01:36:03,335 --> 01:36:08,297
[SPEAKER_25]: And as I've stated in the past, our parks, in my opinion, are underutilized right now.

1275
01:36:09,017 --> 01:36:15,720
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think all you have to look at is what Lowell did during their revitalization of their downtown business district.

1276
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:21,122
[SPEAKER_25]: They also included their many parks throughout the city of Lowell that were in disrepair.

1277
01:36:21,742 --> 01:36:27,184
[SPEAKER_25]: And residents got together, and in some parks, they built little performance stages

1278
01:36:28,071 --> 01:36:38,154
[SPEAKER_25]: and did nifty artwork around the perimeter of the park with steel and metal and really made it an inviting and attractive place for residents to come.

1279
01:36:38,754 --> 01:36:50,318
[SPEAKER_25]: And they're seeing these parks now gone from drug dens, to be quite honest with you, and places that were in disrepair to places where there's performing arts right now.

1280
01:36:50,992 --> 01:36:54,395
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's used as a community gathering spot.

1281
01:36:55,015 --> 01:36:58,598
[SPEAKER_25]: And we right now in this community don't have many of those areas.

1282
01:36:59,018 --> 01:37:05,823
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think what the gentleman just mentioned about bringing some life back into our parks is a very valid point.

1283
01:37:06,463 --> 01:37:09,625
[SPEAKER_25]: And I look forward to that discussion in the future.

1284
01:37:10,206 --> 01:37:14,049
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Marks as amended, all those in favor?

1285
01:37:14,389 --> 01:37:14,529
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

1286
01:37:14,949 --> 01:37:15,810
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

1287
01:37:18,211 --> 01:37:20,753
[SPEAKER_18]: for the establishment of the revolving account.

1288
01:37:20,793 --> 01:37:27,519
[SPEAKER_18]: The chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello to take a paper out of order.

1289
01:37:27,799 --> 01:37:28,520
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1290
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:35,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, if we could take paper number 15-608 out of order, I'd appreciate it.

1291
01:37:35,425 --> 01:37:37,847
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, all those in favor?

1292
01:37:38,187 --> 01:37:38,908
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

1293
01:37:38,988 --> 01:37:39,588
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion carries 15-608.

1294
01:37:41,408 --> 01:37:42,890
[SPEAKER_18]: 608, offered by Councilor Caraviello.

1295
01:37:43,251 --> 01:37:50,501
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council allow Carol Power to address the council about turn the town teal.

1296
01:37:50,701 --> 01:37:51,522
[SPEAKER_18]: Welcome, Carol.

1297
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:54,240
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1298
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:55,340
[SPEAKER_23]: My name's Carol Powers.

1299
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:59,321
[SPEAKER_23]: I live at 20 Walter Street in Medford, and this is Judy Budney.

1300
01:37:59,641 --> 01:38:00,801
[SPEAKER_23]: She's also a committee member.

1301
01:38:01,761 --> 01:38:09,283
[SPEAKER_23]: This is the fourth year we're asking for permission to turn the town, turn Medford, turn the town teal with ribbons.

1302
01:38:11,063 --> 01:38:15,624
[SPEAKER_23]: This is a promotion just to raise awareness for ovarian cancer.

1303
01:38:15,644 --> 01:38:16,884
[SPEAKER_23]: We've done it for the past three years.

1304
01:38:17,284 --> 01:38:20,165
[SPEAKER_23]: We put up the signs, I'm sorry, we put up the bows.

1305
01:38:21,315 --> 01:38:24,999
[SPEAKER_23]: In September, we keep them up for the whole month and then we take them down.

1306
01:38:26,441 --> 01:38:29,505
[SPEAKER_23]: And we just need approval to send it in to turn the town tails.

1307
01:38:31,067 --> 01:38:31,727
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight.

1308
01:38:34,511 --> 01:38:36,012
[SPEAKER_13]: If I may, thank you very much for coming.

1309
01:38:36,593 --> 01:38:40,538
[SPEAKER_13]: This is certainly something that I was happy to support last year and I was able to

1310
01:38:41,188 --> 01:38:43,850
[SPEAKER_13]: get a couple of nice ribbons for us here as well at the council.

1311
01:38:43,870 --> 01:38:45,231
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm certainly happy to support it.

1312
01:38:45,311 --> 01:38:51,815
[SPEAKER_13]: And I might ask that if in fact the measure does pass this evening, that we can have our ribbons displayed right here on our Rostam for first September.

1313
01:38:52,376 --> 01:38:52,696
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

1314
01:38:53,536 --> 01:38:53,837
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1315
01:38:54,597 --> 01:38:55,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello.

1316
01:38:56,218 --> 01:39:04,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, but a ovarian cancer is, is, is very, you know, uh, is a, is a cancer that's very, very serious.

1317
01:39:05,064 --> 01:39:09,247
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, you know, if you've had someone in your family that's had it, you know,

1318
01:39:09,872 --> 01:39:12,313
[SPEAKER_05]: the ramifications and how people suffer with it.

1319
01:39:13,234 --> 01:39:18,516
[SPEAKER_05]: And this group has done a great job over the last few years helping, raising money.

1320
01:39:18,556 --> 01:39:20,497
[SPEAKER_05]: How much money have you raised over the last few years?

1321
01:39:21,258 --> 01:39:28,161
[SPEAKER_23]: This isn't to raise money, but our sisters against ovarian cancer started by Marie Spinelli in Medford, over $200,000.

1322
01:39:28,821 --> 01:39:31,763
[SPEAKER_05]: And I applaud you for that great effort.

1323
01:39:32,457 --> 01:39:40,201
[SPEAKER_23]: We also have a walk in September that contributes to, we have a fundraiser, and then we have a walk, and that contributes to the over $200,000.

1324
01:39:40,562 --> 01:39:51,388
[SPEAKER_23]: And currently, right now, we donated to MIT Koch Institute in Cambridge, and they do cancer research.

1325
01:39:51,448 --> 01:39:52,609
[SPEAKER_23]: So all the money goes there.

1326
01:39:54,270 --> 01:39:54,590
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1327
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:56,631
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Penta.

1328
01:39:57,271 --> 01:39:57,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

1329
01:39:59,645 --> 01:40:02,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Carol, you guys and your girlfriend, you do a wonderful job.

1330
01:40:02,626 --> 01:40:05,208
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the idea, it's not about raising the money, it's just the awareness.

1331
01:40:05,228 --> 01:40:06,528
[SPEAKER_09]: People need to know what's going on.

1332
01:40:06,968 --> 01:40:08,229
[SPEAKER_09]: They shouldn't be afraid to talk about it.

1333
01:40:08,249 --> 01:40:10,150
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the addiction that we have here in the city of Medford.

1334
01:40:10,810 --> 01:40:15,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Huge addiction problem, you know, on drugs and what it does to people and how it can kill them.

1335
01:40:15,872 --> 01:40:17,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Same thing with ovarian cancer, you know.

1336
01:40:17,653 --> 01:40:20,494
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately, it's something you have to deal with.

1337
01:40:20,574 --> 01:40:25,256
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think people need to live with it and people have to understand it and people have to accept it and people have to work for it.

1338
01:40:26,077 --> 01:40:28,498
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have great medical staff here in the Commonwealth of Mass.

1339
01:40:29,165 --> 01:40:32,948
[SPEAKER_09]: But once again, you do our city proud by doing this, make me feel good about it.

1340
01:40:33,809 --> 01:40:37,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I have life experience as it relates to this, so I thank you for what you do.

1341
01:40:37,152 --> 01:40:37,493
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1342
01:40:39,555 --> 01:40:40,295
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Marks.

1343
01:40:40,856 --> 01:40:41,897
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1344
01:40:41,937 --> 01:40:44,179
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you both for your diligence in this.

1345
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:53,007
[SPEAKER_25]: You have an opportunity now to give out a website or any way of people sending a donation.

1346
01:40:53,575 --> 01:40:55,516
[SPEAKER_25]: So at this point, if you could do that.

1347
01:40:55,556 --> 01:41:00,279
[SPEAKER_23]: Aside from Turn the Town Teal, that's a promotion from somebody in Philadelphia.

1348
01:41:00,319 --> 01:41:01,560
[SPEAKER_23]: We're trying to do all the towns.

1349
01:41:01,940 --> 01:41:05,803
[SPEAKER_23]: But our organization is Sisters Against Ovarian Cancer.

1350
01:41:06,103 --> 01:41:10,646
[SPEAKER_23]: The website is www.sistersagainsoc.org.

1351
01:41:11,026 --> 01:41:14,188
[SPEAKER_23]: If you go on the website, you can see register for our walk.

1352
01:41:14,528 --> 01:41:18,310
[SPEAKER_23]: You can make a donation directly to Koch Institute.

1353
01:41:18,410 --> 01:41:19,431
[SPEAKER_23]: All the information is there.

1354
01:41:19,471 --> 01:41:20,592
[SPEAKER_23]: We try to keep it updated.

1355
01:41:21,572 --> 01:41:22,313
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks to Judy.

1356
01:41:24,163 --> 01:41:24,944
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you for all you do.

1357
01:41:25,324 --> 01:41:28,668
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1358
01:41:32,352 --> 01:41:32,893
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be brief.

1359
01:41:32,913 --> 01:41:33,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1360
01:41:33,454 --> 01:41:34,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, present Delaware.

1361
01:41:34,255 --> 01:41:35,376
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for waiting.

1362
01:41:35,396 --> 01:41:38,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for, you know, fighting for a good cause.

1363
01:41:38,279 --> 01:41:42,864
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could just announce when in September the Walker beat will be in where it is September 26 at, um,

1364
01:41:46,394 --> 01:41:47,434
[SPEAKER_23]: It's the Stone Zoo.

1365
01:41:47,774 --> 01:41:50,335
[SPEAKER_23]: We started Maple Grove, which is in the Stone Zoo.

1366
01:41:50,395 --> 01:41:53,015
[SPEAKER_23]: We walk around Spot Pond.

1367
01:41:53,055 --> 01:41:54,235
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a five-mile walk.

1368
01:41:54,616 --> 01:41:57,416
[SPEAKER_23]: It's $25 to register.

1369
01:41:57,436 --> 01:41:59,136
[SPEAKER_23]: You get a t-shirt similar to this.

1370
01:41:59,716 --> 01:42:01,437
[SPEAKER_23]: We change it every year, different colors.

1371
01:42:02,657 --> 01:42:05,257
[SPEAKER_23]: And then everybody just walks the five miles.

1372
01:42:05,297 --> 01:42:06,538
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's a long walk.

1373
01:42:06,778 --> 01:42:07,758
[SPEAKER_23]: And there's a hill.

1374
01:42:08,298 --> 01:42:10,978
[SPEAKER_23]: A lot of people used to say, can't you walk down the hill?

1375
01:42:11,399 --> 01:42:13,539
[SPEAKER_23]: But Marie Spinelli, who was our founder,

1376
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:20,464
[SPEAKER_23]: Somebody mentioned it to her the first year she started this, and she said, no, we're walking up the hill because cancer is an uphill battle.

1377
01:42:20,684 --> 01:42:25,668
[SPEAKER_23]: And so we've even had people since Marie's passing ask us to do that, and we just won't do it.

1378
01:42:26,368 --> 01:42:26,528
[SPEAKER_23]: So.

1379
01:42:27,569 --> 01:42:27,949
[SPEAKER_10]: That's OK.

1380
01:42:28,049 --> 01:42:28,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.

1381
01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:31,252
[SPEAKER_10]: And the time is 10 AM?

1382
01:42:31,312 --> 01:42:32,473
[SPEAKER_23]: Registration is at 830.

1383
01:42:32,533 --> 01:42:33,253
[SPEAKER_23]: The walk starts at 930.

1384
01:42:33,353 --> 01:42:36,996
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a couple of brochures here if you want us to leave them there.

1385
01:42:37,196 --> 01:42:37,396
[SPEAKER_23]: Great.

1386
01:42:37,656 --> 01:42:40,358
[SPEAKER_23]: Good luck with that, and thank you for painting the town teal.

1387
01:42:40,659 --> 01:42:40,979
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1388
01:42:41,842 --> 01:42:43,503
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so very much for what you do.

1389
01:42:44,923 --> 01:42:47,245
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello for approval.

1390
01:42:47,285 --> 01:42:48,065
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1391
01:42:48,085 --> 01:42:49,426
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1392
01:42:49,666 --> 01:42:50,766
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations.

1393
01:42:50,806 --> 01:42:51,947
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1394
01:42:52,487 --> 01:42:53,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Penta.

1395
01:42:53,448 --> 01:42:57,750
[SPEAKER_09]: To let a citizen in the audience speak as it relates to a problem that she has.

1396
01:42:58,850 --> 01:43:03,092
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of Councilor Penta for suspension of the rules to allow citizens to speak.

1397
01:43:03,352 --> 01:43:04,213
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

1398
01:43:04,233 --> 01:43:04,533
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

1399
01:43:05,053 --> 01:43:05,974
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

1400
01:43:06,854 --> 01:43:07,674
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion carries.

1401
01:43:08,835 --> 01:43:10,696
[SPEAKER_18]: Please take your name and address for the record.

1402
01:43:11,927 --> 01:43:13,568
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening, my name is Patricia Brady.

1403
01:43:13,868 --> 01:43:18,831
[SPEAKER_26]: I reside at 73 Walson Street in Medford, and I own a business at 84 High Street.

1404
01:43:19,732 --> 01:43:27,457
[SPEAKER_26]: I won't take a whole lot of your time, but I wanted to bring a situation to your attention that I have mentioned to two of the Councilors.

1405
01:43:27,477 --> 01:43:29,598
[SPEAKER_26]: I own a business in Medford.

1406
01:43:29,738 --> 01:43:31,239
[SPEAKER_26]: I've purchased a business permit.

1407
01:43:32,688 --> 01:43:41,395
[SPEAKER_26]: Unfortunately, I've also learned that there are not sufficient business spots to meet the sale of your business permits.

1408
01:43:42,796 --> 01:43:52,143
[SPEAKER_26]: As a consequence of that, if I am not in the parking lot by 8 a.m., I don't have a spot.

1409
01:43:53,864 --> 01:43:58,948
[SPEAKER_26]: I have probably $500 worth of tickets in a folder sitting behind me.

1410
01:43:59,769 --> 01:44:01,390
[SPEAKER_26]: This afternoon, for example,

1411
01:44:02,562 --> 01:44:07,684
[SPEAKER_26]: I arrived at the office at 3.40 and at 4.01 I had a ticket.

1412
01:44:09,405 --> 01:44:11,726
[SPEAKER_26]: I was there for less than a half hour.

1413
01:44:13,527 --> 01:44:22,891
[SPEAKER_26]: The issue I have is not about eliminating parking and the necessity of parking for the city, but rather to point out the inequity of the process.

1414
01:44:24,752 --> 01:44:29,834
[SPEAKER_26]: You sell a business permit and we should all be responsible and accountable for buying one.

1415
01:44:30,922 --> 01:44:48,391
[SPEAKER_26]: The fact that as a business owner, we do not have a location to park our vehicles, and then we essentially find, and potentially, my car not being able to be re-registered presents a significant problem for my business, for those who come to my business.

1416
01:44:50,132 --> 01:44:57,216
[SPEAKER_26]: I've brought it to the people that are disseminating these tickets, and what I was told was,

1417
01:44:58,530 --> 01:45:01,651
[SPEAKER_26]: take it up with the council, take it up with the parking commission.

1418
01:45:02,191 --> 01:45:02,971
[SPEAKER_26]: So here I am.

1419
01:45:03,291 --> 01:45:21,775
[SPEAKER_26]: Because last week when I called and I pointed out that they had mentioned to a few associates in the building and other business owners that all we needed to do was put a note in our window that we were seeing patients, as I do, that they wouldn't ticket us.

1420
01:45:22,756 --> 01:45:24,476
[SPEAKER_26]: So I have a business permit.

1421
01:45:25,336 --> 01:45:27,637
[SPEAKER_26]: I put on my letterhead, I'm seeing patients.

1422
01:45:28,827 --> 01:45:29,567
[SPEAKER_26]: I get a ticket.

1423
01:45:30,388 --> 01:45:41,853
[SPEAKER_26]: I walked down the street with the man who had just given me the ticket, and I pointed to another business owner who has a placard in his window speaking to what business he runs.

1424
01:45:41,873 --> 01:45:44,134
[SPEAKER_26]: I said, well, what about him?

1425
01:45:45,135 --> 01:45:50,037
[SPEAKER_26]: Why is he allowed to park literally in front of his door and not be tagged?

1426
01:45:51,358 --> 01:45:53,539
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, it's because he's carrying something heavy.

1427
01:45:54,602 --> 01:45:56,423
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, on a given day, I could be too.

1428
01:45:57,284 --> 01:46:06,269
[SPEAKER_26]: And on a given day, I can be summoned to court with 30 minutes notice, and I don't have the luxury of walking to my car another 15 minutes down the street.

1429
01:46:07,370 --> 01:46:14,014
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'm here to ask for your assistance in remedying this, and I offer a solution.

1430
01:46:14,655 --> 01:46:22,480
[SPEAKER_26]: The solution is allow business owners to occupy a spot on the street if they have a business permit.

1431
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:24,482
[SPEAKER_26]: It seems pretty simple to me.

1432
01:46:25,342 --> 01:46:33,450
[SPEAKER_26]: To continually punish owners without sufficient business spots is ludicrous.

1433
01:46:34,511 --> 01:46:36,072
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm not one to complain.

1434
01:46:36,092 --> 01:46:42,378
[SPEAKER_26]: I've sat behind this rail and I wouldn't be here but for the amount of tickets I now have.

1435
01:46:42,858 --> 01:46:47,542
[SPEAKER_26]: I got one yesterday and one today in the same window of time.

1436
01:46:48,437 --> 01:46:49,277
[SPEAKER_26]: That's outrageous.

1437
01:46:49,558 --> 01:46:51,258
[SPEAKER_26]: And quite frankly, I'm taking it personal.

1438
01:46:51,639 --> 01:46:53,479
[SPEAKER_26]: I think they're looking for my plate number now.

1439
01:46:55,721 --> 01:46:56,581
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for your time.

1440
01:46:59,202 --> 01:46:59,682
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Ms.

1441
01:46:59,702 --> 01:47:00,023
[SPEAKER_18]: Brady.

1442
01:47:02,704 --> 01:47:05,025
[SPEAKER_18]: Chair recognizes Councilor Penta.

1443
01:47:05,045 --> 01:47:08,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Patty, can you answer this question, please?

1444
01:47:09,207 --> 01:47:13,549
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the response been back to you from this Park Medford place?

1445
01:47:13,709 --> 01:47:17,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, these people that are from Tennessee that are running this place.

1446
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:19,201
[SPEAKER_26]: They've told me to appeal the ticket.

1447
01:47:20,161 --> 01:47:22,983
[SPEAKER_26]: I've appealed more than you see there in that pile.

1448
01:47:23,623 --> 01:47:31,328
[SPEAKER_26]: I have gotten maybe a handful of responses, some saying that they've overturned it, some saying that I still need to pay it.

1449
01:47:32,008 --> 01:47:33,709
[SPEAKER_26]: It makes absolutely no sense.

1450
01:47:33,849 --> 01:47:39,993
[SPEAKER_26]: And then when I called and asked to speak to someone above the person on the phone, they gave me to Patrick.

1451
01:47:41,153 --> 01:47:43,134
[SPEAKER_26]: And Patrick said, well, I can't help you.

1452
01:47:43,174 --> 01:47:44,075
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know what to tell you.

1453
01:47:45,625 --> 01:47:47,226
[SPEAKER_26]: And I said, well, who can I talk to?

1454
01:47:47,286 --> 01:47:51,270
[SPEAKER_26]: They then connected us to kind of a regional representative.

1455
01:47:51,350 --> 01:48:00,777
[SPEAKER_26]: He was a little bit more helpful, acknowledged the problem, said that we recognized that we sold business permits that there were not spots for, and we're working on it.

1456
01:48:01,738 --> 01:48:07,343
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, that's not going to help me tomorrow when I have to be in and out by nature of the business that I do.

1457
01:48:08,404 --> 01:48:12,467
[SPEAKER_26]: So I don't know what to do, but when I can't register my car, I'll be back.

1458
01:48:13,810 --> 01:48:22,062
[SPEAKER_26]: So I would ask that there be some policy, and I would ask that that policy be instituted retroactively, because I'm sure I'm not standing here alone.

1459
01:48:22,082 --> 01:48:29,493
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the fact of what you're saying just represents the failure within the system.

1460
01:48:30,302 --> 01:48:46,093
[SPEAKER_09]: The city of Medford is equally responsible for you getting those tickets, because if they're giving out more permits than the spaces are allotted, and they're not making provisos for it, what they're doing is they're grabbing the money, just like this group from Tennessee are, taking the money, and they don't really care where it's coming from and how.

1461
01:48:46,953 --> 01:48:48,034
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't make any sense.

1462
01:48:48,354 --> 01:48:51,196
[SPEAKER_09]: This does not cultivate a business community at all.

1463
01:48:51,856 --> 01:48:57,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Bad enough that the kiosks are doing what they're doing, and now they want to put kiosks in the parking lots, which again becomes another issue.

1464
01:48:57,628 --> 01:49:02,672
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact of the matter is that you are a legitimate business person and you should be treated the same as everyone else.

1465
01:49:03,193 --> 01:49:11,680
[SPEAKER_09]: But for that person to indicate to you because they're carrying heavy boxes, how do they know that that person's carrying heavy boxes as compared to what you carry or what you don't carry?

1466
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:13,221
[SPEAKER_09]: It's absolutely wrong.

1467
01:49:13,421 --> 01:49:15,503
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the problem with this whole system.

1468
01:49:15,923 --> 01:49:17,845
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an out-of-state company and it's not in-state.

1469
01:49:17,865 --> 01:49:19,987
[SPEAKER_09]: They take 68% of our money and they run with it.

1470
01:49:20,327 --> 01:49:21,308
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact of the matter is,

1471
01:49:21,817 --> 01:49:24,618
[SPEAKER_09]: It's anti-business, it's anti-consumer, it's anti-friendly.

1472
01:49:24,738 --> 01:49:26,158
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no reason for this.

1473
01:49:26,758 --> 01:49:32,020
[SPEAKER_09]: So as a business community, I would hope that the Chamber of Commerce recognizes this because they have a big stake to play in this.

1474
01:49:32,980 --> 01:49:36,421
[SPEAKER_09]: The Chamber supposedly is the spokesperson for all the business people.

1475
01:49:36,861 --> 01:49:42,543
[SPEAKER_09]: And as a business person and as a member of the Chamber, if in fact this is going on, somebody needs to speak up.

1476
01:49:42,583 --> 01:49:46,804
[SPEAKER_09]: It's quite obvious you're not going to get it from the Conor office because that's his program, this is what he wants.

1477
01:49:47,584 --> 01:49:51,585
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is the only place people can come to speak about this and understand and recognize the fact

1478
01:49:51,912 --> 01:49:54,674
[SPEAKER_09]: that this is wrong, this is so terribly, terribly wrong.

1479
01:49:55,674 --> 01:50:04,139
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I were you, I'd probably look at the, I would probably go to the city solicitor and say, before you entertain anything legal or otherwise, this has got to stop.

1480
01:50:04,779 --> 01:50:20,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if he is representing the city of Medford as legal counsel, and the city of Medford is issuing these permits, knowing that there are not enough spaces, and they don't do what you said, which is very simple, just park on the street for the time period in question, then what are you supposed to do?

1481
01:50:21,399 --> 01:50:25,262
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't do anything other than get a ticket, but the city can do something about it.

1482
01:50:25,922 --> 01:50:27,383
[SPEAKER_09]: They've changed the amount of kiosks.

1483
01:50:27,664 --> 01:50:29,625
[SPEAKER_09]: They've changed the dollar amount.

1484
01:50:31,466 --> 01:50:33,368
[SPEAKER_09]: We can go on and on in this whole subject matter.

1485
01:50:33,968 --> 01:50:36,430
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not good, it's not healthy, and it's not business-friendly.

1486
01:50:36,450 --> 01:50:37,511
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not consumer-friendly.

1487
01:50:38,391 --> 01:50:45,757
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll sit here and say, I apologize for your problems that you have, because this is just so terribly wrong.

1488
01:50:46,357 --> 01:50:48,799
[SPEAKER_09]: And hopefully, after the first of the year, this will be changed.

1489
01:50:49,563 --> 01:50:50,543
[SPEAKER_09]: This will be changed.

1490
01:50:50,623 --> 01:50:56,865
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I hope it's done before the first of the year, but... Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

1491
01:50:58,045 --> 01:51:02,446
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to thank Pat Brady for coming up.

1492
01:51:04,127 --> 01:51:09,228
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was probably about three months ago that this issue came up before the council.

1493
01:51:09,248 --> 01:51:16,350
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember, you know, all the councils had concerns in issues with the parking program, but I remember this specifically came up and Council Pender and I

1494
01:51:17,694 --> 01:51:23,938
[SPEAKER_10]: brought up the issue because probably we spoke to you with regards to not having enough business permit parking spots.

1495
01:51:24,518 --> 01:51:27,140
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that, like you said, you gave a resolve for it.

1496
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:32,423
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a number of different things that could be done, but the bottom line is we need more business permit spots.

1497
01:51:32,924 --> 01:51:40,648
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it was Park Medford who was here, but Park Medford, I think, declared that there was enough business permits parking spots.

1498
01:51:40,728 --> 01:51:46,252
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if they're including the Condon Shell or, you know, where the discrepancy is.

1499
01:51:46,747 --> 01:51:51,769
[SPEAKER_10]: But obviously, if you have a handful of tickets, probably 30, 40 tickets, I'm assuming.

1500
01:51:51,789 --> 01:51:52,030
[SPEAKER_10]: At least.

1501
01:51:52,570 --> 01:51:52,950
[SPEAKER_00]: At least.

1502
01:51:53,010 --> 01:51:54,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Then obviously, there is an issue.

1503
01:51:54,931 --> 01:52:01,874
[SPEAKER_10]: And for somebody like you, a professional who's in and out of court, you need to get a spot probably four or five times a day, sometimes upwards of.

1504
01:52:02,755 --> 01:52:12,540
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we need to resolve the issue by putting in more permit parking spots on top of the 10, 20 resolves that we've put forward.

1505
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:15,141
[SPEAKER_10]: This council did, I believe, vote

1506
01:52:16,102 --> 01:52:17,223
[SPEAKER_10]: to resolve that issue.

1507
01:52:17,303 --> 01:52:18,924
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it just has gone nowhere.

1508
01:52:19,044 --> 01:52:20,805
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we have the chief of police in the audience.

1509
01:52:20,846 --> 01:52:23,427
[SPEAKER_26]: Maybe he can come up and... I just spoke to him about it.

1510
01:52:24,608 --> 01:52:26,169
[SPEAKER_26]: And honestly, someone said to call him.

1511
01:52:26,189 --> 01:52:28,971
[SPEAKER_26]: I had already done that, been to the parking commission.

1512
01:52:29,352 --> 01:52:31,253
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we're on the agenda for September.

1513
01:52:31,854 --> 01:52:32,754
[SPEAKER_26]: But to what end?

1514
01:52:32,774 --> 01:52:37,738
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, the bottom line is there's got to be a remedy, and I think I proposed a reasonable one.

1515
01:52:38,832 --> 01:52:49,119
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm prepared to buy business spots for my entire staff, but I'm not going to do it when I'm still getting tagged after I've bought a ticket, a permit.

1516
01:52:50,681 --> 01:53:01,969
[SPEAKER_10]: I would move that the parking commission, in conjunction with Park Medford, work on a resolve to creating more declared parking spots for business owners.

1517
01:53:03,958 --> 01:53:07,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether that's in different locations, it doesn't have to be in front of the business.

1518
01:53:07,539 --> 01:53:12,261
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be, but it doesn't have to be in front of the business, whether that's up Governor's Ave.

1519
01:53:12,321 --> 01:53:15,642
[SPEAKER_10]: We need more business parking spots because this should not be happening.

1520
01:53:15,662 --> 01:53:21,204
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're paying a fee, a yearly fee that's declared by the city, this should not be happening.

1521
01:53:21,304 --> 01:53:28,126
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's unfortunate for a business owner who's doing the right thing, following the rules to get tagged week after week.

1522
01:53:29,434 --> 01:53:31,075
[SPEAKER_10]: with 40, 50 parking tickets.

1523
01:53:31,476 --> 01:53:35,279
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's right, and I think we need to fix that before January 1st.

1524
01:53:35,759 --> 01:53:42,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I hope there is, I think there will be resolved January, but we need to do that sooner than later, as we spoke about three months ago.

1525
01:53:43,485 --> 01:53:57,336
[SPEAKER_15]: So the motion is from Councilor Lungo-Koehn that the Medford Parking Commission, in conjunction with Park Medford, which is, what is it, Republican parking?

1526
01:53:58,393 --> 01:54:06,801
[SPEAKER_16]: that they straighten out the situation vis-a-vis the commercial parking stickers.

1527
01:54:07,201 --> 01:54:07,862
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Camuso.

1528
01:54:08,022 --> 01:54:08,682
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

1529
01:54:09,003 --> 01:54:09,663
[SPEAKER_32]: Just real quick.

1530
01:54:10,184 --> 01:54:19,812
[SPEAKER_32]: This program originally, I don't want to talk about the program, but the parking enforcement was initiated by the businesses and residents that couldn't get parking spots in the square.

1531
01:54:20,152 --> 01:54:21,934
[SPEAKER_32]: You drove through the square a year and a half ago.

1532
01:54:22,814 --> 01:54:25,677
[SPEAKER_32]: Every business owner was parked all day in front of their store.

1533
01:54:26,627 --> 01:54:29,210
[SPEAKER_32]: Matter of fact, some of them were so blatant, they had their vehicles leaded.

1534
01:54:29,751 --> 01:54:37,721
[SPEAKER_32]: You couldn't go in and get an ice cream, or you couldn't go in and get something to eat, or your nail's done, or this or that, because they were parked in front of their businesses.

1535
01:54:38,962 --> 01:54:43,668
[SPEAKER_32]: I think what we're losing sight of is a business permit is just that, it's a business permit.

1536
01:54:44,513 --> 01:54:58,036
[SPEAKER_32]: I can assure you, when the days of the Cambridge Courthouse was open, you could buy a permit, but if you weren't there by seven o'clock, the cone would be in front of the garage, and you'd be riding around, feeding the meter until midday, and then you'd come out and move your car during your breaks.

1537
01:54:59,197 --> 01:55:01,377
[SPEAKER_32]: So a permit is no way guaranteeing a spot.

1538
01:55:02,357 --> 01:55:11,459
[SPEAKER_32]: I understand you'd like to park in front of your place all day with a business permit on the window, and that sounds easy, but the consumers need these places to park.

1539
01:55:11,759 --> 01:55:13,980
[SPEAKER_32]: That's what we heard from the businesses in Medford Square,

1540
01:55:14,704 --> 01:55:15,905
[SPEAKER_32]: and throughout this community.

1541
01:55:16,885 --> 01:55:18,365
[SPEAKER_32]: Perhaps you misunderstood.

1542
01:55:18,766 --> 01:55:20,626
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not looking to park in front of my door.

1543
01:55:21,406 --> 01:55:22,127
[SPEAKER_32]: Not even close.

1544
01:55:22,167 --> 01:55:25,328
[SPEAKER_32]: You want to park on the street with a business permit for as long as you're going to be there.

1545
01:55:25,528 --> 01:55:26,548
[SPEAKER_32]: That's basically what you said.

1546
01:55:26,568 --> 01:55:29,869
[SPEAKER_26]: I want to have the option if I can't get a business spot.

1547
01:55:30,590 --> 01:55:32,230
[SPEAKER_26]: I go to the business lot first.

1548
01:55:32,650 --> 01:55:35,291
[SPEAKER_32]: But as I said, a business permit is a permit only.

1549
01:55:36,892 --> 01:55:38,192
[SPEAKER_32]: You can have all the permits in the world.

1550
01:55:38,212 --> 01:55:42,714
[SPEAKER_32]: You go to Davis Square and you park behind the Davis Square T Station.

1551
01:55:44,150 --> 01:55:48,571
[SPEAKER_32]: If you have a permit, you have to get there early, and you have to be there in time so there's a spot available.

1552
01:55:48,611 --> 01:55:52,032
[SPEAKER_32]: Otherwise, you wait outside the garage, you see a car pull out, and then you can pull in.

1553
01:55:52,392 --> 01:55:56,873
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, I sympathize with you, but the fact of the matter is, this is where this was all generated.

1554
01:55:57,173 --> 01:56:04,174
[SPEAKER_32]: It was by the business community, it was by the people that wanted to utilize the squares that couldn't because of the business owners parking in front of their squares all day.

1555
01:56:04,495 --> 01:56:06,575
[SPEAKER_32]: If we do the simple solution that you're suggesting,

1556
01:56:07,573 --> 01:56:12,978
[SPEAKER_32]: Why don't we throw the parking out, you can park in front of your business all day, and then the consumers won't have a place to park.

1557
01:56:13,018 --> 01:56:14,159
[SPEAKER_32]: That's where we came from.

1558
01:56:15,622 --> 01:56:16,662
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, that's where we came from.

1559
01:56:17,063 --> 01:56:18,703
[SPEAKER_26]: And you can't argue with that.

1560
01:56:18,783 --> 01:56:22,205
[SPEAKER_26]: I guess there's not an easy solution to a difficult problem.

1561
01:56:22,285 --> 01:56:22,885
[SPEAKER_26]: I understand that.

1562
01:56:23,225 --> 01:56:25,346
[SPEAKER_26]: But the fact is, this is a problem.

1563
01:56:25,606 --> 01:56:28,907
[SPEAKER_26]: And I would appreciate it if you didn't minimize it.

1564
01:56:29,028 --> 01:56:39,992
[SPEAKER_26]: But for a business owner that did buy the permit, that can't find a spot in a lot, in addition, the kiosks in the block around my office, I'd say 50% of the time don't work.

1565
01:56:45,238 --> 01:56:48,319
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, well that's something we can take care of, and the Chief just heard that.

1566
01:56:48,639 --> 01:56:58,603
[SPEAKER_32]: But with all due respect, when you say I want to minimize it, that's not the case, because you're talking to someone that's father, owned a drugstore in Winchester Center for 25 plus years.

1567
01:56:59,323 --> 01:57:07,446
[SPEAKER_32]: And let me tell you, he had a business sticker, but if there wasn't a spot available, he took the gamble, and it was up to him to either pay a ticket or go home.

1568
01:57:07,886 --> 01:57:10,147
[SPEAKER_32]: He certainly wasn't going home and shutting the door on the drugstore.

1569
01:57:10,922 --> 01:57:12,083
[SPEAKER_32]: He certainly wasn't doing that.

1570
01:57:12,603 --> 01:57:19,666
[SPEAKER_32]: But the fact of the matter is, sometimes with his bad heart, he'd have to park up near Stop and Shop and walk a little bit, or he'd have to park on Church Street and walk a little bit.

1571
01:57:20,067 --> 01:57:21,768
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, I understand your frustrations.

1572
01:57:22,088 --> 01:57:28,351
[SPEAKER_32]: But the easy solution of just parking in front of the businesses on the street, that's why we're into this over the years.

1573
01:57:28,931 --> 01:57:29,912
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's not sugarcoat it.

1574
01:57:29,972 --> 01:57:34,714
[SPEAKER_32]: That's why we are into parking enforcement.

1575
01:57:34,754 --> 01:57:37,936
[SPEAKER_26]: I guess we'll have to agree to disagree, because I'm not asking to park in front of my door.

1576
01:57:38,216 --> 01:57:39,577
[SPEAKER_32]: No, you're asking to park on the street

1577
01:57:43,935 --> 01:57:45,116
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't think it's fair.

1578
01:57:45,136 --> 01:57:48,399
[SPEAKER_10]: The person before the podium just making a suggestion.

1579
01:57:48,459 --> 01:57:49,840
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's up to park Medford.

1580
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:54,764
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's up to the traffic commission to figure out what percentage of the lot is business parking.

1581
01:57:54,844 --> 01:57:58,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Should we have more, you know, a larger percent of the lot business parking?

1582
01:57:58,387 --> 01:58:12,178
[SPEAKER_10]: And Governor Zav, I mean, there are probably 10 other different ideas that can be thrown around, but the bottom line is whether it's probably not in front of the businesses, but there needs to be more spots designated as business parking.

1583
01:58:12,458 --> 01:58:13,179
[SPEAKER_10]: This is an issue.

1584
01:58:13,582 --> 01:58:21,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Our business owners need to be able to park somewhere so that they can get to and from their offices, even if it is a five-minute walk.

1585
01:58:22,266 --> 01:58:34,172
[SPEAKER_10]: They need to be able to get to their offices without being ticketed after they bought a business permit, spent their money, did the right thing, followed the rules and regs, and can't park anywhere without getting a ticket.

1586
01:58:34,632 --> 01:58:35,713
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to find a resolve.

1587
01:58:36,191 --> 01:58:38,797
[SPEAKER_10]: to that issue and many, many others with the parking program.

1588
01:58:44,685 --> 01:58:50,747
[SPEAKER_32]: and Councilor Robert M. Penta, you were afforded that opportunity, as well as you and you and you and you and you and me.

1589
01:58:51,267 --> 01:58:52,807
[SPEAKER_32]: And that is the lot behind St.

1590
01:58:52,847 --> 01:58:53,247
[SPEAKER_32]: Joseph's.

1591
01:58:53,727 --> 01:58:56,088
[SPEAKER_32]: The Chamber of Commerce worked diligently with this city council.

1592
01:58:56,108 --> 01:59:01,309
[SPEAKER_32]: If people don't want to walk across the bridge to get to their business, then I just, it's a catch-22.

1593
01:59:02,049 --> 01:59:02,710
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a catch-22.

1594
01:59:03,450 --> 01:59:08,391
[SPEAKER_32]: People, people now can get a spot when they go to the doctors in Governor's Ave and Bradley Road, but

1595
01:59:10,188 --> 01:59:16,472
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, this was emanated when people were parking in front of their businesses year after year with names on their vehicles.

1596
01:59:16,492 --> 01:59:18,553
[SPEAKER_26]: And they're still doing it, and they're not getting tagged.

1597
01:59:18,813 --> 01:59:20,634
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, if you see that, you should be calling the police.

1598
01:59:20,674 --> 01:59:22,576
[SPEAKER_32]: Or call me, and I'll call the police.

1599
01:59:22,656 --> 01:59:22,996
[SPEAKER_26]: I did.

1600
01:59:23,036 --> 01:59:23,536
[SPEAKER_26]: And you know what?

1601
01:59:23,896 --> 01:59:25,678
[SPEAKER_26]: I was told they carry something that's heavy.

1602
01:59:26,518 --> 01:59:27,559
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, you know what?

1603
01:59:27,659 --> 01:59:28,439
[SPEAKER_32]: That's unacceptable.

1604
01:59:28,479 --> 01:59:30,761
[SPEAKER_32]: And I know you were conversing with the chief out there, I'm sure.

1605
01:59:31,021 --> 01:59:31,901
[SPEAKER_32]: Did you tell the chief that?

1606
01:59:31,941 --> 01:59:32,602
[SPEAKER_26]: I certainly did.

1607
01:59:32,822 --> 01:59:37,405
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, because I understand you, in your business, you've got to carry probably briefs and things of that nature, boxes to court.

1608
01:59:37,445 --> 01:59:38,866
[SPEAKER_26]: Right, and I'm on call for court.

1609
01:59:39,945 --> 01:59:41,086
[SPEAKER_26]: And it is what it is.

1610
01:59:41,326 --> 01:59:42,187
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'm not there.

1611
01:59:42,427 --> 01:59:44,549
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't always have the luxury of getting there by 8 o'clock.

1612
01:59:44,609 --> 01:59:46,390
[SPEAKER_32]: I wish I did, but I don't.

1613
01:59:46,470 --> 01:59:47,811
[SPEAKER_32]: And listen, I sympathize with you.

1614
01:59:47,831 --> 01:59:51,934
[SPEAKER_32]: But at the same token, it was the Chamber of Commerce and the businesses that pushed this.

1615
01:59:51,974 --> 01:59:54,696
[SPEAKER_32]: Believe me, this is what we all hear the calls about.

1616
01:59:54,716 --> 01:59:57,699
[SPEAKER_32]: There's a happy medium out there somewhere.

1617
01:59:57,919 --> 01:59:58,259
[SPEAKER_26]: You're right.

1618
01:59:58,439 --> 02:00:00,200
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'm here to advocate for that.

1619
02:00:00,281 --> 02:00:01,461
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, absolutely.

1620
02:00:01,802 --> 02:00:07,646
[SPEAKER_32]: But with that being said, the mayor, as you know, is the contract negotiating authority.

1621
02:00:09,189 --> 02:00:11,130
[SPEAKER_32]: You should be speaking with him regarding this.

1622
02:00:11,210 --> 02:00:12,110
[SPEAKER_32]: We can bring the message.

1623
02:00:12,190 --> 02:00:14,111
[SPEAKER_26]: I guess they told me to come to you.

1624
02:00:14,251 --> 02:00:16,092
[SPEAKER_26]: So, you know, I'm a rule follower.

1625
02:00:16,352 --> 02:00:16,793
[SPEAKER_26]: Here I am.

1626
02:00:17,153 --> 02:00:23,216
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, you being a former elected official should understand that the council is a legislative body and not the administrative authority.

1627
02:00:24,076 --> 02:00:24,456
[SPEAKER_32]: It's tough.

1628
02:00:24,636 --> 02:00:27,037
[SPEAKER_32]: We're not the executive in in January.

1629
02:00:27,057 --> 02:00:32,020
[SPEAKER_32]: I know at least one candidate has a plan for parking that was in the newspaper a few weeks ago.

1630
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:34,161
[SPEAKER_32]: So we'll see what happens in January.

1631
02:00:34,201 --> 02:00:38,803
[SPEAKER_32]: But at least for now, I would suggest that you contact the mayor's office and

1632
02:00:39,294 --> 02:00:40,255
[SPEAKER_32]: to demand to see him.

1633
02:00:40,535 --> 02:00:41,516
[SPEAKER_32]: You pay enough in taxes.

1634
02:00:42,156 --> 02:00:42,597
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll do that.

1635
02:00:42,817 --> 02:00:44,719
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1636
02:00:44,839 --> 02:00:46,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1637
02:00:46,220 --> 02:00:48,862
[SPEAKER_13]: And Miss Brady, thank you for being here this evening and sharing your story with us.

1638
02:00:49,783 --> 02:00:51,944
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the council needs to go a step further than what we've done.

1639
02:00:52,825 --> 02:00:56,248
[SPEAKER_13]: We've sent resolutions after resolution after resolution to the corner office.

1640
02:00:56,268 --> 02:00:58,530
[SPEAKER_13]: We've asked for the traffic commission to come in up here before us.

1641
02:00:59,655 --> 02:01:24,707
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that maybe we can take an opportunity to have our transportation subcommittee investigate the situation relative to the number of business permits that are being issued, the number of business permit parking spots that are available in our business districts, and report their findings back as well as proposed solutions to the council and the committee of a whole, something that we can all support, something that we can all get behind, and we'll present that to the Medford, Park Medford and the parking commission.

1642
02:01:25,107 --> 02:01:27,528
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think that, you know, we've,

1643
02:01:27,860 --> 02:01:29,321
[SPEAKER_13]: We've spoke a lot about the issue.

1644
02:01:30,202 --> 02:01:35,045
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been outspoken in certain aspects of what we don't like and we haven't effectuated much change.

1645
02:01:35,465 --> 02:01:39,267
[SPEAKER_13]: We did a good job at the beginning effectuating change and it's beginning to fall on deaf ears again.

1646
02:01:39,307 --> 02:01:42,930
[SPEAKER_13]: We filed a number of resolutions and we're not getting the responses that we like.

1647
02:01:43,230 --> 02:01:44,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't we take ownership of the issue?

1648
02:01:44,651 --> 02:01:47,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't we put this into our transportation subcommittee?

1649
02:01:47,373 --> 02:01:53,777
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a subcommittee hearing where we bring the principals together and we sit down and we try to bang out a solution that's gonna really resolve the problem.

1650
02:01:54,610 --> 02:02:09,139
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Mr. President, I would amend the paper by asking that the Transportation Subcommittee meet to conduct an investigation and provide findings and solutions to the committee level relative to the issue of business parking, the number of spots that are available in our business districts, and the number of permits that are being issued.

1651
02:02:11,260 --> 02:02:17,184
[SPEAKER_13]: The outcome could be a recommendation to limit the number of business permits for a particular business because there aren't enough spots.

1652
02:02:17,244 --> 02:02:18,565
[SPEAKER_13]: There could be recommendations.

1653
02:02:19,192 --> 02:02:20,353
[SPEAKER_13]: that fall right in line with what Ms.

1654
02:02:20,373 --> 02:02:21,333
[SPEAKER_13]: Brady requested.

1655
02:02:21,533 --> 02:02:32,160
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think that we need to take a better, longer, harder look at it and come up with some solutions that will work and findings that are going to be based on fact before we move any further.

1656
02:02:32,980 --> 02:02:39,344
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of Council Vice President Legle Curran, as amended by Councilor Knight.

1657
02:02:39,984 --> 02:02:40,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor.

1658
02:02:41,365 --> 02:02:42,645
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks.

1659
02:02:43,446 --> 02:02:44,447
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1660
02:02:44,467 --> 02:02:46,127
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Patty, for coming up.

1661
02:02:47,673 --> 02:02:54,181
[SPEAKER_25]: I think Councilor Knight just hit the nail on the head to get the information on the number of business permits that are out there and how many are being sold.

1662
02:02:54,721 --> 02:03:03,631
[SPEAKER_25]: But also, and we have the Chief in the audience, I was under the impression that only Medford residents can get commuter parking stickers.

1663
02:03:03,691 --> 02:03:04,692
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that still true, Chief?

1664
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:17,320
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening.

1665
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:20,421
[SPEAKER_22]: Leo Sacco, police chief, 227 Elm Street in Medford.

1666
02:03:21,101 --> 02:03:25,523
[SPEAKER_22]: The commuter parking, I believe, is only for residents right now.

1667
02:03:25,563 --> 02:03:27,784
[SPEAKER_22]: The commuter parking permits are only for residents.

1668
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:30,945
[SPEAKER_22]: Has that been looked at recently?

1669
02:03:30,965 --> 02:03:32,865
[SPEAKER_25]: They're not selling them to anyone outside the community?

1670
02:03:32,965 --> 02:03:33,686
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll have to check.

1671
02:03:33,766 --> 02:03:41,688
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I've had some other issues going on, so I'd have to check to find out for sure whether, as far as I know, it's only Medford residents.

1672
02:03:41,748 --> 02:03:45,630
[SPEAKER_22]: And after 10 o'clock, if spaces are available, I think it's open parking for others.

1673
02:03:47,010 --> 02:03:48,711
[SPEAKER_22]: But that's just in the commuter parking area.

1674
02:03:48,771 --> 02:03:59,340
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, the business area, and I think there's an answer on the business permits and the number of them that are out there, they base their estimates on what was in place last year.

1675
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:06,385
[SPEAKER_22]: Now that you have enforcement, a lot of the businesses and employees of the businesses have opted to purchase the permits.

1676
02:04:06,405 --> 02:04:07,906
[SPEAKER_22]: So the numbers have skyrocketed.

1677
02:04:07,986 --> 02:04:16,473
[SPEAKER_25]: But, Chief, what I'm getting at is if the intent is to have business owners be able to park and Method residents be able to have commuter parking,

1678
02:04:16,998 --> 02:04:37,843
[SPEAKER_25]: and we're selling them to people outside the community, which I'm led to believe is happening now, then that takes from business owners, because we can shift, you know, if we don't have enough people going for commuter parking that live in the city, and there's an overflow of people outside the community that can come in and buy passes, that defeats the whole purpose.

1679
02:04:38,443 --> 02:04:43,865
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'd rather see a business owner that can take that spot rather than an outside commuter.

1680
02:04:45,095 --> 02:04:51,019
[SPEAKER_22]: But I think in the area that we're speaking of on High Street, there isn't a commuter parking area at all in that area.

1681
02:04:51,039 --> 02:04:51,860
[SPEAKER_25]: But that's one area.

1682
02:04:51,940 --> 02:04:53,101
[SPEAKER_22]: But that's one area.

1683
02:04:53,161 --> 02:04:58,325
[SPEAKER_22]: The only out-of-town commuters that I know that park are right over here across from City Hall.

1684
02:04:58,905 --> 02:05:00,586
[SPEAKER_22]: And I believe there's a kiosk that will be in there.

1685
02:05:00,626 --> 02:05:02,247
[SPEAKER_22]: They'll have to pay $5 for a day.

1686
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:05,530
[SPEAKER_22]: They're not going to, there won't be a permit.

1687
02:05:05,970 --> 02:05:07,211
[SPEAKER_25]: What about along Playstead Road?

1688
02:05:07,851 --> 02:05:12,755
[SPEAKER_22]: Playstead Road is, right now the permits are for residents only.

1689
02:05:13,353 --> 02:05:19,016
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll have to check to see, but I'm told it's residents only and others after 10 a.m.

1690
02:05:19,076 --> 02:05:24,258
[SPEAKER_22]: if there are available spaces can pay the $5 for the day and take the spot.

1691
02:05:24,538 --> 02:05:27,700
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we're going to find chief and this has nothing to do with you.

1692
02:05:28,123 --> 02:05:31,304
[SPEAKER_25]: they're overselling these business permit parking stickers.

1693
02:05:31,344 --> 02:05:35,204
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, again, it goes back to what they had estimates from last year before the enforcement.

1694
02:05:35,224 --> 02:05:40,345
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't forget, the mayor's original plan was to charge $400 for a business permit parking sticker.

1695
02:05:40,706 --> 02:05:43,006
[SPEAKER_25]: And when the businesses heard that, they were outraged.

1696
02:05:44,106 --> 02:05:44,706
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's correct that.

1697
02:05:44,746 --> 02:05:45,887
[SPEAKER_22]: That was not the mayor's.

1698
02:05:45,967 --> 02:05:49,887
[SPEAKER_22]: That was something that was passed at the traffic commission and subsequently rescinded.

1699
02:05:51,448 --> 02:05:52,768
[SPEAKER_22]: That was not the mayor's suggestion.

1700
02:05:53,776 --> 02:05:56,919
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a tough time believing nothing happens without the mayor's input.

1701
02:05:56,999 --> 02:05:59,881
[SPEAKER_22]: But needless to say, Chief.

1702
02:06:00,202 --> 02:06:00,362
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

1703
02:06:01,623 --> 02:06:11,753
[SPEAKER_25]: But I think now what we're seeing is the fact that they had to lower it to the $100, they figure they'll just sell four times more the passes and make up the difference.

1704
02:06:12,353 --> 02:06:14,315
[SPEAKER_25]: But if you could check into that, Chief.

1705
02:06:14,335 --> 02:06:18,179
[SPEAKER_22]: There's certainly room for some corrective action on some of the things that are going on.

1706
02:06:19,058 --> 02:06:21,540
[SPEAKER_22]: Part of the problem is there are only so many spaces.

1707
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:23,201
[SPEAKER_22]: I do agree with Councilor Camuso.

1708
02:06:23,221 --> 02:06:24,122
[SPEAKER_22]: He hit the nail on the head.

1709
02:06:25,443 --> 02:06:32,889
[SPEAKER_22]: Because of business owners parking on High Street, Riverside Avenue, Salem Street, there was never a spot available for anybody else.

1710
02:06:33,609 --> 02:06:40,294
[SPEAKER_22]: So now that there's the enforcement and the business permit in place and people had to purchase them, they move outside the square.

1711
02:06:40,375 --> 02:06:41,535
[SPEAKER_22]: They move to a distance.

1712
02:06:42,056 --> 02:06:44,898
[SPEAKER_22]: It's unfortunate that if someone's on call for something,

1713
02:06:45,357 --> 02:06:46,097
[SPEAKER_22]: It's unfortunate.

1714
02:06:46,278 --> 02:06:49,119
[SPEAKER_22]: And I hate saying this, but I'm going to say it because no one wants to say it.

1715
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:51,841
[SPEAKER_22]: Then maybe they have to evaluate where they're working.

1716
02:06:51,881 --> 02:06:59,506
[SPEAKER_22]: If it's something, if their type of business is such that, you know, in 15 minutes they have to be someplace else, then maybe they don't want to be in the center of Medford square.

1717
02:07:00,026 --> 02:07:04,329
[SPEAKER_22]: And maybe it's someone else that's going to be there all day, a doctor or a dentist that isn't leaving the office.

1718
02:07:05,170 --> 02:07:07,051
[SPEAKER_22]: But that's, that's just natural.

1719
02:07:07,091 --> 02:07:11,774
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, that's just something that, that, you know, that might have to take place.

1720
02:07:12,174 --> 02:07:12,995
[SPEAKER_22]: The other piece is,

1721
02:07:14,135 --> 02:07:16,196
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, we need additional parking.

1722
02:07:16,296 --> 02:07:19,818
[SPEAKER_22]: We need, you know, I didn't think I was going to say this, but we need a garage.

1723
02:07:20,678 --> 02:07:22,639
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to have the additional parking out there.

1724
02:07:22,659 --> 02:07:32,303
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to be able to solve some of the problems for the businesses and for people who want to enjoy Medford Square to go to a restaurant or go to Chevalier.

1725
02:07:32,763 --> 02:07:38,006
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, we're at that point where, you know, no one wants it to be Sleepy Hollow anymore.

1726
02:07:38,728 --> 02:07:47,315
[SPEAKER_22]: We want it to thrive, and I'm looking forward to a revitalization of Method Square, and I don't think it can happen without serious consideration for a garage.

1727
02:07:50,198 --> 02:07:54,301
[SPEAKER_22]: But I will check on the commuter thing, because if that's happening, that's something that I'm not aware of.

1728
02:07:54,521 --> 02:07:55,282
[SPEAKER_22]: But I'll check.

1729
02:07:56,563 --> 02:07:57,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, my chief.

1730
02:07:58,385 --> 02:08:00,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks, have we concluded?

1731
02:08:00,987 --> 02:08:02,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1732
02:08:02,408 --> 02:08:04,230
[SPEAKER_15]: The chair recognizes Councilor Penta.

1733
02:08:05,210 --> 02:08:05,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Chief.

1734
02:08:06,780 --> 02:08:08,080
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to greatly disagree with you.

1735
02:08:08,340 --> 02:08:10,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't appreciate that last statement.

1736
02:08:10,481 --> 02:08:14,802
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have a job that you have to be out of the square in every 15 minutes, maybe you should look for a different job.

1737
02:08:14,822 --> 02:08:17,982
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I didn't say different job, maybe a different location that's more appropriate.

1738
02:08:18,002 --> 02:08:22,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, if somebody wants to be in Medford Square for location, I don't care if they were in there every five or 10 minutes, whatever it might be.

1739
02:08:23,323 --> 02:08:27,724
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem is there was a legitimate taxpayer citizen came up here to tell you her concerns.

1740
02:08:28,124 --> 02:08:33,745
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, the nub to the whole matter is if a business person can park in front of their place,

1741
02:08:34,508 --> 02:08:36,630
[SPEAKER_09]: because allegedly they're carrying heavy boxes.

1742
02:08:37,170 --> 02:08:41,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Who was he or who was she to make a determination as it relates to another business person?

1743
02:08:41,634 --> 02:08:42,275
[SPEAKER_09]: That's number one.

1744
02:08:42,455 --> 02:08:44,857
[SPEAKER_22]: But I just heard that piece tonight, and I will look into that.

1745
02:08:44,877 --> 02:08:45,798
[SPEAKER_09]: You heard it tonight, all right.

1746
02:08:45,858 --> 02:08:46,679
[SPEAKER_09]: I just heard that tonight.

1747
02:08:47,019 --> 02:08:47,719
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is new.

1748
02:08:48,340 --> 02:08:56,847
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had a multitude of problems with this company since they've been in here, dating back to when they first started in October, when the contract was signed, and they officially took off on January 15.

1749
02:08:57,828 --> 02:09:02,032
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it took from January, and we heard they were going to go in March, and then we heard they were in May.

1750
02:09:02,408 --> 02:09:09,433
[SPEAKER_09]: It wound up until the end of July before they even found their way over to the senior center to explain to the seniors that they were going to do something.

1751
02:09:09,793 --> 02:09:15,096
[SPEAKER_09]: We have kiosks on High Street, as you and I have spoken about, in front of two-family homes that don't belong there.

1752
02:09:15,396 --> 02:09:19,439
[SPEAKER_09]: We have kiosks that are going to go in parking lots where the signage hasn't even changed.

1753
02:09:19,799 --> 02:09:23,061
[SPEAKER_09]: The parking lots are supposed to be three-hour municipal parking lots.

1754
02:09:23,542 --> 02:09:31,367
[SPEAKER_09]: And now you're going to put a kiosk in there with signs that say 15 minutes, 30 minutes, one hour, and two hours, all in the same parking lot.

1755
02:09:32,179 --> 02:09:33,840
[SPEAKER_09]: How is a kiosk going to address that?

1756
02:09:34,120 --> 02:09:35,822
[SPEAKER_09]: How is anyone supposed to figure that out?

1757
02:09:36,262 --> 02:09:36,782
[SPEAKER_09]: You tell me.

1758
02:09:36,922 --> 02:09:37,383
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1759
02:09:38,624 --> 02:09:40,545
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, I told you, Chief, they got to go.

1760
02:09:41,235 --> 02:09:42,176
[SPEAKER_09]: It is unfriendly.

1761
02:09:42,236 --> 02:09:42,916
[SPEAKER_09]: It's unhealthy.

1762
02:09:42,976 --> 02:09:43,857
[SPEAKER_09]: It's poor for business.

1763
02:09:44,197 --> 02:09:46,118
[SPEAKER_09]: We are not like downtown Boston.

1764
02:09:46,138 --> 02:09:47,319
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not even like Somerville.

1765
02:09:47,679 --> 02:09:48,640
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just like Medford.

1766
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:50,741
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to get ourselves back in action.

1767
02:09:51,001 --> 02:09:52,782
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to get a downtown vibrancy.

1768
02:09:52,802 --> 02:10:00,087
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to get all our little cities and towns, the sister cities that make up this community, to have a collage of types of businesses that entice people.

1769
02:10:00,667 --> 02:10:02,989
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole idea was not revenue enhancement.

1770
02:10:03,209 --> 02:10:04,550
[SPEAKER_09]: It was revenue enforcement.

1771
02:10:04,790 --> 02:10:09,533
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you had revenue enforcement, maybe every two hours, and that's more than enough time to be on the street,

1772
02:10:09,793 --> 02:10:13,918
[SPEAKER_09]: and the cars were ticketed, and they were tagged, and maybe they were told, the message will get out there.

1773
02:10:13,938 --> 02:10:16,040
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't need more than two hours in most of these businesses.

1774
02:10:16,460 --> 02:10:20,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Hairdressers, for example, in West Medford, some of them go maybe two or three hours, okay?

1775
02:10:21,226 --> 02:10:24,950
[SPEAKER_09]: And because of the concern that was brought up by the city,

1776
02:10:25,602 --> 02:10:29,003
[SPEAKER_09]: that it was the city people that were doing the signs and that was against the union.

1777
02:10:29,063 --> 02:10:31,844
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the company was doing the signs and the city should have been doing it.

1778
02:10:31,864 --> 02:10:32,685
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a union contract.

1779
02:10:32,985 --> 02:10:34,325
[SPEAKER_09]: They haven't even changed the signs yet.

1780
02:10:34,765 --> 02:10:36,366
[SPEAKER_09]: So now you're going to be put these kiosks in there.

1781
02:10:36,386 --> 02:10:38,347
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to be charging people after two hours.

1782
02:10:38,367 --> 02:10:39,487
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to tell them to move a car.

1783
02:10:40,007 --> 02:10:44,409
[SPEAKER_09]: And the most stupidest thing of all of this thing is how do you park yourself in a spot?

1784
02:10:45,090 --> 02:10:46,731
[SPEAKER_09]: And you only can be there for two hours.

1785
02:10:46,791 --> 02:10:48,632
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you put the money in there, you get a ticket.

1786
02:10:48,892 --> 02:10:53,054
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can move up one more spot, because the GPS system tells you it's OK.

1787
02:10:53,274 --> 02:10:54,815
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can sit there for another two hours.

1788
02:10:55,115 --> 02:10:58,097
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you come from out of state with an out-of-state plate, it doesn't take it.

1789
02:10:58,137 --> 02:10:59,498
[SPEAKER_09]: You're automatically going to get a ticket.

1790
02:10:59,938 --> 02:11:01,099
[SPEAKER_09]: There are so many frailties.

1791
02:11:01,119 --> 02:11:02,419
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not open on a Saturday.

1792
02:11:02,980 --> 02:11:04,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody else gets a ticket on a Saturday.

1793
02:11:05,021 --> 02:11:09,983
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not open on a Saturday for someone to go there and have a concern, whatever the concern might be.

1794
02:11:11,064 --> 02:11:12,925
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, they're nothing but out-of-state hustlers

1795
02:11:13,268 --> 02:11:17,089
[SPEAKER_09]: They're bounty hunters, they get 68% of whatever the profit is, for what?

1796
02:11:17,469 --> 02:11:19,950
[SPEAKER_09]: To cause all this confusion, animosity, and concern?

1797
02:11:20,470 --> 02:11:21,931
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Chief, it's not good for the city.

1798
02:11:22,331 --> 02:11:26,492
[SPEAKER_09]: You're my friend and I told you this before, this is not your job, not your responsibility.

1799
02:11:28,273 --> 02:11:31,514
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't belong in your bailiwick, it belongs in a commission.

1800
02:11:31,774 --> 02:11:37,556
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't belong in the diversity director of this city to be the hearings officer for someone who might get a ticket.

1801
02:11:38,036 --> 02:11:40,317
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't take two months for tickets to be heard.

1802
02:11:40,777 --> 02:11:42,338
[SPEAKER_09]: That's insanity, that's crazy.

1803
02:11:43,140 --> 02:11:49,726
[SPEAKER_09]: And if somebody wants to go there, and it's closed on a Saturday because they can't get there on a workday, that's not fair either.

1804
02:11:50,447 --> 02:11:51,908
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's OK for them to give tickets.

1805
02:11:52,268 --> 02:11:53,810
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you don't like it, we'll appeal it.

1806
02:11:54,030 --> 02:11:55,612
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what happens on the appeal process?

1807
02:11:56,072 --> 02:11:57,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody says, I'm not coming back.

1808
02:11:57,553 --> 02:11:59,015
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll pay it, but I'll never come back here again.

1809
02:11:59,355 --> 02:12:00,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to West Medford.

1810
02:12:00,596 --> 02:12:01,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to South Medford.

1811
02:12:01,297 --> 02:12:02,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to Haines Square.

1812
02:12:02,558 --> 02:12:03,779
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll leave the name of the personnel.

1813
02:12:03,839 --> 02:12:05,260
[SPEAKER_09]: One particular business is off 8% to 12%.

1814
02:12:05,300 --> 02:12:06,802
[SPEAKER_09]: 8% to 12% because of that crazy chaos.

1815
02:12:09,327 --> 02:12:10,047
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know where they go?

1816
02:12:10,247 --> 02:12:13,989
[SPEAKER_09]: They go down the street where they say, like saying business, and there's no kiosk.

1817
02:12:14,429 --> 02:12:15,629
[SPEAKER_09]: You tell me how that's fair.

1818
02:12:15,749 --> 02:12:16,430
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not fair.

1819
02:12:17,070 --> 02:12:19,291
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know it's unfair, and I know it's unfair.

1820
02:12:19,811 --> 02:12:23,252
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why this whole thing is just not good for the city of Medford.

1821
02:12:23,512 --> 02:12:33,236
[SPEAKER_09]: And if the city administration, before he bows out, recognizes it and says, I made a mistake, let's correct it, let's get rid of it, and come in with a program, I will stand here and publicly compliment him.

1822
02:12:33,456 --> 02:12:34,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I said that to you before.

1823
02:12:34,676 --> 02:12:39,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I will stand up publicly and compliment the mayor for recognizing the mistake that he made.

1824
02:12:39,587 --> 02:12:42,069
[SPEAKER_09]: and correcting it because he doesn't want to hurt the business people.

1825
02:12:42,409 --> 02:12:45,491
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitely not good for the taxpaying citizens.

1826
02:12:46,011 --> 02:12:49,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Go into the shops in Medford Square and ask them what they think about that.

1827
02:12:49,313 --> 02:12:51,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ask the customers what they think about this.

1828
02:12:52,355 --> 02:12:53,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Why should I go and worry about it?

1829
02:12:53,856 --> 02:12:56,818
[SPEAKER_09]: I was with a lady last Friday in Haines Square.

1830
02:12:57,118 --> 02:12:59,239
[SPEAKER_09]: The poor woman went into the shop to get her clothing.

1831
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:00,900
[SPEAKER_09]: She comes out with her clothing.

1832
02:13:01,201 --> 02:13:03,082
[SPEAKER_09]: She had 18 minutes left on her ticket.

1833
02:13:03,542 --> 02:13:06,564
[SPEAKER_09]: And right number, 18 minutes, and she still got the ticket.

1834
02:13:07,004 --> 02:13:08,865
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not the first time I've heard that story.

1835
02:13:09,105 --> 02:13:10,146
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't like it, appeal it.

1836
02:13:10,767 --> 02:13:11,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's wrong.

1837
02:13:11,567 --> 02:13:12,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe there's something wrong.

1838
02:13:12,528 --> 02:13:16,570
[SPEAKER_09]: If these things all run off the sun, maybe the sun isn't working right, whatever it might be.

1839
02:13:16,890 --> 02:13:20,853
[SPEAKER_09]: It certainly doesn't work right for those solar compacts that Waste Management has.

1840
02:13:21,173 --> 02:13:23,414
[SPEAKER_09]: The doors are open and the rubbish is all over the place.

1841
02:13:24,195 --> 02:13:26,336
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Chief, you're my friend.

1842
02:13:26,356 --> 02:13:29,178
[SPEAKER_09]: I like you, but I do not agree in this program.

1843
02:13:29,778 --> 02:13:32,660
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a complete disaster to the operation of this community.

1844
02:13:41,846 --> 02:13:49,968
[SPEAKER_22]: The only way I can respond to that through the chair is that obviously this program was brought in to get something up and running.

1845
02:13:50,508 --> 02:13:54,629
[SPEAKER_22]: Wherever it goes from that point, hopefully it improves as it goes along.

1846
02:13:55,710 --> 02:13:58,070
[SPEAKER_22]: It does need constant supervision.

1847
02:13:58,490 --> 02:14:03,572
[SPEAKER_22]: The traffic commission is made up of other department heads and two residents of the city.

1848
02:14:03,632 --> 02:14:04,932
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a non-paying commission.

1849
02:14:06,270 --> 02:14:14,114
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, meeting once a month on parking issues does not manage the traffic or the parking management program.

1850
02:14:14,294 --> 02:14:22,739
[SPEAKER_22]: They're a company, they're supervised to some degree by onsite managers from the company, and we watch it, you know, from the distance.

1851
02:14:23,820 --> 02:14:30,883
[SPEAKER_22]: Hearing a complaint like that, favoritism, taking care of one merchant but putting the boots to somebody else is totally wrong.

1852
02:14:31,544 --> 02:14:33,885
[SPEAKER_22]: But this is the first time I'm hearing that, but I'm not naive.

1853
02:14:34,289 --> 02:14:34,950
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it possible?

1854
02:14:34,970 --> 02:14:35,510
[SPEAKER_22]: Could it go on?

1855
02:14:35,550 --> 02:14:37,011
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, this is a human factor.

1856
02:14:37,031 --> 02:14:37,912
[SPEAKER_22]: That's going to happen.

1857
02:14:38,493 --> 02:14:40,695
[SPEAKER_22]: But we need to have that brought to our attention.

1858
02:14:42,416 --> 02:14:48,502
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, what I had said about what you said you were offended by is the fact that, you know, maybe someone has to reevaluate.

1859
02:14:49,623 --> 02:14:51,765
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's the honest answer.

1860
02:14:52,125 --> 02:14:58,751
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, if your nature of your business is in and out, that you as the proprietor are in and out of that business and you have to be other places,

1861
02:14:59,497 --> 02:15:04,784
[SPEAKER_22]: Then you pick a location that maybe has off-street parking, or you pick a location where there's plenty of parking.

1862
02:15:05,585 --> 02:15:15,098
[SPEAKER_22]: To be in the middle of Medford Square, and I know it's not as lively as Medford Square should be, but you can't anticipate because you bought a permit that there's going to be available spaces.

1863
02:15:15,762 --> 02:15:17,283
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to create additional spaces.

1864
02:15:17,323 --> 02:15:20,645
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll look at that, but I can tell you it's not going to be in that section of High Street.

1865
02:15:21,265 --> 02:15:23,466
[SPEAKER_22]: It may be up on Governor's Ave a little further up.

1866
02:15:24,647 --> 02:15:31,331
[SPEAKER_22]: And obviously the Condon shelf, the back wall of the Governor's Ave lot I know fills up quite early in the morning, but that's it.

1867
02:15:31,391 --> 02:15:32,812
[SPEAKER_22]: The rest of it's open for customers.

1868
02:15:33,512 --> 02:15:38,255
[SPEAKER_22]: So there's a number of issues, but we can't, we really can't change the geography.

1869
02:15:38,295 --> 02:15:38,995
[SPEAKER_22]: We can add some.

1870
02:15:39,095 --> 02:15:41,657
[SPEAKER_09]: But chief, if we really want to be business friendly,

1871
02:15:42,430 --> 02:15:46,351
[SPEAKER_09]: and we're comparing a business-friendly to a commuter pass.

1872
02:15:47,131 --> 02:15:55,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't we just cut back on the commuter passes and give more of the business passes, and at least if you have given out 134, you have 134 spots.

1873
02:15:59,914 --> 02:16:09,316
[SPEAKER_32]: The rules clearly state that commuter parking, now Councilor Marks brought up a very valid point that they may be selling them to out-of-towners, but according to the policy and the rules,

1874
02:16:11,158 --> 02:16:13,819
[SPEAKER_32]: 100% of commuter passes are Medford residents.

1875
02:16:14,459 --> 02:16:19,961
[SPEAKER_32]: And to take their parking privileges away, I don't support that at all.

1876
02:16:20,661 --> 02:16:21,042
[SPEAKER_32]: At all.

1877
02:16:21,062 --> 02:16:24,423
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a thought process.

1878
02:16:25,223 --> 02:16:33,826
[SPEAKER_22]: But it doesn't help Medford Square, because there are no commuter parking areas, with the exception of the lot across the street, on the other side of Clippership Drive.

1879
02:16:34,206 --> 02:16:39,708
[SPEAKER_22]: So there are no commuter parking spots in the center of Medford Square, anywhere around whether it be Forest Street,

1880
02:16:40,410 --> 02:16:45,615
[SPEAKER_22]: Governor's Avenue, Bradley Road, Hillside Ave, Boynton Road.

1881
02:16:45,955 --> 02:16:47,236
[SPEAKER_22]: There's nothing there.

1882
02:16:47,456 --> 02:16:51,640
[SPEAKER_22]: So we can't say we're going to cut down on commuters to add to business, because we don't have that.

1883
02:16:52,461 --> 02:16:58,707
[SPEAKER_09]: And West Bedford Chief, on Playstead Road, as you know, you're lucky if there's one car there during that day, that $5 parking.

1884
02:16:59,007 --> 02:17:03,511
[SPEAKER_09]: And all those people that were parking there now have put themselves into the neighborhood, OK?

1885
02:17:05,048 --> 02:17:17,634
[SPEAKER_22]: If they have, I haven't heard the complaints, because I think with all the permit parking that's on the side streets off of Playstead Road, we would have been receiving the calls, even though Republic is the enforcement arm, we would be getting it at the police department.

1886
02:17:18,055 --> 02:17:30,601
[SPEAKER_22]: And going back to, you know, business parking in the square and vehicles parking on the main streets, you remember all the complaints that used to be generated when the police officers went out there and did the enforcement, and they were just chalking tires.

1887
02:17:32,469 --> 02:17:35,630
[SPEAKER_22]: The appeals process was people would say, I wasn't there for two hours.

1888
02:17:36,050 --> 02:17:37,370
[SPEAKER_22]: How do you know I was there for two hours?

1889
02:17:37,390 --> 02:17:38,270
[SPEAKER_22]: We had no mechanism.

1890
02:17:38,310 --> 02:17:42,452
[SPEAKER_22]: We had no meter to say, you know, the red flag was up and, and the vehicle should be tagged.

1891
02:17:42,792 --> 02:17:47,793
[SPEAKER_22]: We were tracking tires and, and a lot of tickets were, were dismissed because you really couldn't prove it.

1892
02:17:48,013 --> 02:17:53,454
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, other than the fact that the officer said that car was there two hours and 15 minutes, they got the ticket.

1893
02:17:53,674 --> 02:17:56,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Councilor Marks alluded to this fact a few months ago.

1894
02:17:56,462 --> 02:18:04,304
[SPEAKER_09]: where they have these handheld devices that'll acknowledge how long the car is there, and it comes up, and it just comes right off the computer handheld.

1895
02:18:04,745 --> 02:18:10,586
[SPEAKER_09]: They have that in Somerville in spots where they don't have meters because the people are walking by, and they have a person in each one of the squares.

1896
02:18:10,826 --> 02:18:13,067
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember now, Somerville's been in business 30 years.

1897
02:18:13,127 --> 02:18:20,849
[SPEAKER_22]: They bring in $8 million a year, and their overhead is about $3.5 to $4 million that they run their program.

1898
02:18:21,350 --> 02:18:22,830
[SPEAKER_22]: But the idea is they've been in,

1899
02:18:23,395 --> 02:18:25,016
[SPEAKER_22]: They've been in position for a long time.

1900
02:18:25,056 --> 02:18:26,757
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a separate standalone entity.

1901
02:18:27,177 --> 02:18:29,198
[SPEAKER_22]: You have a traffic and parking director.

1902
02:18:29,318 --> 02:18:32,419
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a full-fledged department.

1903
02:18:32,639 --> 02:18:35,981
[SPEAKER_22]: They're in charge of lights and lines, so they take care of traffic lights.

1904
02:18:36,021 --> 02:18:37,382
[SPEAKER_22]: They take care of crosswalks.

1905
02:18:37,982 --> 02:18:41,864
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything to do with traffic and parking, they handle it under their roof.

1906
02:18:42,244 --> 02:18:47,326
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not sure how many staff people they have, but it's a full-blown agency within the city of Selma.

1907
02:18:47,366 --> 02:18:50,568
[SPEAKER_09]: But Chief, all we're asking for is to start off small and just work our way up to it.

1908
02:18:50,588 --> 02:18:51,268
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what I just said.

1909
02:18:51,348 --> 02:18:51,708
[SPEAKER_22]: Grow it.

1910
02:18:51,929 --> 02:18:52,269
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it?

1911
02:18:52,369 --> 02:18:52,709
[SPEAKER_22]: Grow it.

1912
02:18:55,393 --> 02:18:56,254
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, say Councilor Penta.

1913
02:18:56,414 --> 02:18:56,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1914
02:18:58,436 --> 02:18:59,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello.

1915
02:18:59,356 --> 02:18:59,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1916
02:19:00,017 --> 02:19:04,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief, I, I see a much simpler solution, uh, for the business parking problem.

1917
02:19:05,221 --> 02:19:09,125
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot out here and back that's never full all day.

1918
02:19:09,445 --> 02:19:18,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't we take two rows and may and dedicate that for business parking until we either come up with some more wrong, but I said, this, this lot out here is never full.

1919
02:19:19,773 --> 02:19:22,275
[SPEAKER_05]: take a row or two rows, and we make that dedicated for business only.

1920
02:19:22,536 --> 02:19:26,158
[SPEAKER_22]: Are we talking about the one directly behind here, or are we talking about the one?

1921
02:19:26,178 --> 02:19:28,440
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the one, the bigger one, where the buses go.

1922
02:19:29,081 --> 02:19:29,521
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1923
02:19:29,701 --> 02:19:31,363
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, the one right in back here.

1924
02:19:31,383 --> 02:19:32,263
[SPEAKER_22]: Right behind the city hall?

1925
02:19:32,283 --> 02:19:32,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1926
02:19:33,504 --> 02:19:35,806
[SPEAKER_22]: But that doesn't help the people further up on High Street.

1927
02:19:35,826 --> 02:19:36,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're going to have to walk down here.

1928
02:19:36,987 --> 02:19:39,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, listen, Chief, there's nobody lazier than me.

1929
02:19:43,072 --> 02:19:47,516
[SPEAKER_05]: But I say, this lot is always, always empty.

1930
02:19:47,996 --> 02:19:48,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Take two rows.

1931
02:19:49,210 --> 02:19:50,931
[SPEAKER_05]: and dedicate that for business parking.

1932
02:19:51,011 --> 02:19:55,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, people are walking down from Route 16 to walking up.

1933
02:19:56,315 --> 02:19:59,677
[SPEAKER_05]: If they have a permit, I mean, that's a viable alternative.

1934
02:19:59,697 --> 02:20:02,078
[SPEAKER_05]: We own a lot in the state.

1935
02:20:02,138 --> 02:20:03,159
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, we could combine it.

1936
02:20:03,219 --> 02:20:06,241
[SPEAKER_22]: You could have the time limit or a business permit.

1937
02:20:06,381 --> 02:20:09,563
[SPEAKER_05]: But give the business permit people maybe two rows.

1938
02:20:09,603 --> 02:20:11,124
[SPEAKER_05]: We add 25 spots over there.

1939
02:20:11,704 --> 02:20:13,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you drive by it every day.

1940
02:20:13,345 --> 02:20:16,707
[SPEAKER_05]: There's never anybody in that lot that would fill it up.

1941
02:20:18,831 --> 02:20:22,074
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's the easiest solution until we come up with something better.

1942
02:20:22,094 --> 02:20:24,536
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good suggestion.

1943
02:20:25,056 --> 02:20:25,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1944
02:20:25,957 --> 02:20:26,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Camuso.

1945
02:20:27,178 --> 02:20:27,538
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

1946
02:20:27,618 --> 02:20:32,282
[SPEAKER_32]: And, uh, I'm sorry.

1947
02:20:33,183 --> 02:20:33,383
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

1948
02:20:35,545 --> 02:20:37,206
[SPEAKER_18]: As amended by Councilor Caraviello.

1949
02:20:38,107 --> 02:20:39,168
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, thank you.

1950
02:20:39,688 --> 02:20:42,671
[SPEAKER_32]: And I got to agree with Councilor Caraviello.

1951
02:20:43,792 --> 02:20:45,093
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm looking at this realistically.

1952
02:20:46,495 --> 02:20:52,318
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't have to yell and scream about it because it's not a campaign year for me, unlike everyone else that's sitting in this room tonight, a lot of you.

1953
02:20:53,258 --> 02:20:57,360
[SPEAKER_32]: I look at it and try to look at it realistically.

1954
02:20:57,861 --> 02:21:06,785
[SPEAKER_32]: A year and a half ago, at four in the afternoon, if I wanted to go and take my son for an ice cream in Medford Square, I wouldn't have been able to get a spot.

1955
02:21:06,985 --> 02:21:09,386
[SPEAKER_32]: I would have drove around four or five times.

1956
02:21:09,587 --> 02:21:10,527
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that's realistic.

1957
02:21:10,787 --> 02:21:12,748
[SPEAKER_32]: I think most people agree with that.

1958
02:21:12,808 --> 02:21:14,109
[SPEAKER_32]: People are nodding their heads in the audience.

1959
02:21:15,725 --> 02:21:30,495
[SPEAKER_32]: I look now, a year later, with the inception of this program, I can't remember the last time I had to drive around to go get that same ice cream at four o'clock in today's parking program.

1960
02:21:31,376 --> 02:21:42,823
[SPEAKER_32]: Is it culture shock, having to pay to park in the city of Medford, which hasn't had meters since the 19, I'm not even sure what year, but you look at the old photos, they had them in Medford Square in front of Stagliano's liquor store,

1961
02:21:44,213 --> 02:21:45,334
[SPEAKER_32]: Sure Pharmacy at the time.

1962
02:21:45,354 --> 02:21:46,055
[SPEAKER_32]: They came out in 1982.

1963
02:21:46,275 --> 02:21:47,776
[SPEAKER_32]: They came out in 1982.

1964
02:21:49,097 --> 02:21:54,162
[SPEAKER_32]: So from 82 to 2014, it slowly built up.

1965
02:21:54,282 --> 02:21:58,265
[SPEAKER_32]: And there wasn't a need for it in the 90s because there wasn't as many cars on the road.

1966
02:21:58,706 --> 02:22:02,709
[SPEAKER_32]: There wasn't as much cars in each household.

1967
02:22:03,290 --> 02:22:06,132
[SPEAKER_32]: And the development has been more throughout the city too.

1968
02:22:06,192 --> 02:22:11,257
[SPEAKER_32]: Not particularly in the squares, but on the outer edges of some of the areas, there's been more development.

1969
02:22:13,306 --> 02:22:20,050
[SPEAKER_32]: Other than paying to park in the enforcement piece, I think the consumers are happy.

1970
02:22:20,351 --> 02:22:21,191
[SPEAKER_32]: I've got to be honest.

1971
02:22:22,592 --> 02:22:24,994
[SPEAKER_32]: Other councillors may get 200 calls about this issue.

1972
02:22:26,435 --> 02:22:27,175
[SPEAKER_32]: I haven't got it.

1973
02:22:27,295 --> 02:22:28,836
[SPEAKER_32]: At first, it was culture shock.

1974
02:22:28,876 --> 02:22:29,737
[SPEAKER_32]: I was getting the calls.

1975
02:22:30,257 --> 02:22:31,078
[SPEAKER_32]: I was getting the calls.

1976
02:22:31,558 --> 02:22:35,621
[SPEAKER_32]: Matter of fact, I'd like to see someone's call log.

1977
02:22:37,046 --> 02:22:39,267
[SPEAKER_32]: Someone's call log of all the calls they're getting.

1978
02:22:39,307 --> 02:22:41,747
[SPEAKER_32]: Black out the names, because I quite honestly don't believe it.

1979
02:22:42,167 --> 02:22:45,148
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't believe when people are saying they're getting 200 calls, 300 calls about it.

1980
02:22:45,608 --> 02:22:46,948
[SPEAKER_32]: It doesn't add up.

1981
02:22:47,488 --> 02:22:48,169
[SPEAKER_32]: It doesn't add up.

1982
02:22:49,209 --> 02:22:53,410
[SPEAKER_32]: With that being said, Mr. President, I understand people are still getting used to it.

1983
02:22:54,490 --> 02:22:56,790
[SPEAKER_32]: And I understand that wholeheartedly.

1984
02:22:57,191 --> 02:23:02,792
[SPEAKER_32]: But when some businesses say they're down 8% to 12%, I have other businesses

1985
02:23:04,052 --> 02:23:11,134
[SPEAKER_32]: So I have no reason to not tell the 100% truth, that say this is the best thing that ever happened to their numbers.

1986
02:23:13,475 --> 02:23:14,935
[SPEAKER_32]: Now we may shop in different places.

1987
02:23:15,475 --> 02:23:18,876
[SPEAKER_32]: Maybe some people tell me what I want to hear, tell another Councilor what they want to hear.

1988
02:23:19,096 --> 02:23:21,557
[SPEAKER_32]: But I'm telling you, I have been told this by businesses.

1989
02:23:21,857 --> 02:23:22,597
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not making it up.

1990
02:23:23,017 --> 02:23:23,877
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not making this up.

1991
02:23:25,358 --> 02:23:26,178
[SPEAKER_32]: The fact of the matter is,

1992
02:23:27,603 --> 02:23:29,644
[SPEAKER_32]: This is more consumer-friendly in one aspect.

1993
02:23:30,045 --> 02:23:32,006
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not consumer-friendly because you have to pay now.

1994
02:23:32,526 --> 02:23:35,768
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not business-friendly because you can't park your car in front of the business all day.

1995
02:23:36,188 --> 02:23:39,290
[SPEAKER_32]: But there's also businesses out there that are happy with this.

1996
02:23:39,770 --> 02:23:40,411
[SPEAKER_32]: They're happy with this.

1997
02:23:41,592 --> 02:23:46,955
[SPEAKER_32]: This chamber has not had over 50 people in it in one night regarding the parking.

1998
02:23:47,335 --> 02:23:47,655
[SPEAKER_32]: Hasn't.

1999
02:23:48,236 --> 02:23:48,556
[SPEAKER_32]: Hasn't.

2000
02:23:48,836 --> 02:23:51,177
[SPEAKER_32]: We have a city of 60,000 people.

2001
02:23:51,197 --> 02:23:53,319
[SPEAKER_32]: 60,000 people live in this city.

2002
02:23:55,622 --> 02:24:01,026
[SPEAKER_32]: If the councillors get the 300 calls that they say they do, if they actually get 300 calls, God bless them.

2003
02:24:01,766 --> 02:24:04,288
[SPEAKER_32]: It's still less than 1% of the community.

2004
02:24:05,549 --> 02:24:05,949
[SPEAKER_32]: It's still.

2005
02:24:06,790 --> 02:24:10,052
[SPEAKER_32]: So, like I said, I just, I don't hear the complaints.

2006
02:24:10,132 --> 02:24:16,817
[SPEAKER_32]: I hear the young, and it's funny too, because the same people, and I bring this up when the drive-throughs come up.

2007
02:24:18,327 --> 02:24:28,029
[SPEAKER_32]: The same people now are stopping at these businesses because there may be parking where before they'd drive an extra three miles, drive by two Dunkin' Donuts or two banks to go to the one with the drive-thru because they couldn't find a spot.

2008
02:24:28,069 --> 02:24:29,469
[SPEAKER_32]: They didn't want to get out of the car and stuff.

2009
02:24:29,949 --> 02:24:33,970
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, so obviously there's some people that are happy with it.

2010
02:24:34,110 --> 02:24:35,470
[SPEAKER_32]: There's some people that are not happy with it.

2011
02:24:35,850 --> 02:24:37,311
[SPEAKER_32]: But that's just through my eyes.

2012
02:24:37,571 --> 02:24:41,772
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, I'm given a fair synopsis of what I see out there.

2013
02:24:42,432 --> 02:24:43,172
[SPEAKER_32]: I haven't heard the

2014
02:24:43,918 --> 02:24:53,383
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, I can give you probably 50 emails of people that have complained about it over the six or seven months, but I'm just going by what I've experienced.

2015
02:24:53,403 --> 02:24:56,564
[SPEAKER_32]: And like I said, I don't have to give a speech.

2016
02:24:57,124 --> 02:24:57,725
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm retired.

2017
02:24:57,745 --> 02:24:58,705
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm off into the sunset.

2018
02:24:59,206 --> 02:24:59,966
[SPEAKER_32]: Good luck to all of you.

2019
02:25:01,026 --> 02:25:03,868
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm just telling you what... I'm just...

2020
02:25:06,873 --> 02:25:08,954
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, with all due respect, Val, Val, we're cleaning.

2021
02:25:09,214 --> 02:25:12,174
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not even going to get into the parking lot mess over there in West Medford.

2022
02:25:12,554 --> 02:25:22,337
[SPEAKER_32]: But with that being said, Mr. President, with that being said, Mr. President, I'm giving a brief synopsis of what I see.

2023
02:25:23,397 --> 02:25:26,578
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's just one city councilor out of seven.

2024
02:25:27,358 --> 02:25:30,179
[SPEAKER_32]: And I know there's other councilors here that have

2025
02:25:31,196 --> 02:25:33,878
[SPEAKER_32]: Got some of the same feedback because people have told them directly.

2026
02:25:33,978 --> 02:25:37,740
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'm not going to put them on the spot because it's not fair to do that if they don't want to talk about it.

2027
02:25:38,121 --> 02:25:45,546
[SPEAKER_32]: But there is people out there that are very happy with this program, as well as not happy with it.

2028
02:25:45,906 --> 02:25:47,787
[SPEAKER_32]: But more, I get positive feedback.

2029
02:25:48,488 --> 02:25:49,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Councilor.

2030
02:25:51,990 --> 02:25:56,153
[SPEAKER_15]: I know some citizens want to speak on the matter, so please welcome.

2031
02:25:56,674 --> 02:25:59,515
[SPEAKER_15]: The state your name and address for the record, please.

2032
02:25:59,535 --> 02:26:01,855
[SPEAKER_27]: Joanne Haney, 123 Playstead Road.

2033
02:26:03,536 --> 02:26:05,876
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not here to complain right now.

2034
02:26:06,076 --> 02:26:07,016
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm just here.

2035
02:26:07,336 --> 02:26:07,777
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm old.

2036
02:26:07,877 --> 02:26:08,477
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm tired.

2037
02:26:08,517 --> 02:26:09,357
[SPEAKER_27]: I want to go home.

2038
02:26:09,377 --> 02:26:09,977
[SPEAKER_27]: Me too.

2039
02:26:09,997 --> 02:26:19,899
[SPEAKER_27]: But I want to thank Michael Marks for all the help that he gave me in regards to this parking situation.

2040
02:26:19,919 --> 02:26:22,040
[SPEAKER_27]: It happens to be in front of my house.

2041
02:26:23,499 --> 02:26:27,663
[SPEAKER_27]: We think we pretty much have it solved, and I hope we do.

2042
02:26:28,063 --> 02:26:29,744
[SPEAKER_27]: But he has been tremendous.

2043
02:26:29,924 --> 02:26:32,566
[SPEAKER_27]: He is one great council member.

2044
02:26:33,187 --> 02:26:34,608
[SPEAKER_27]: He has done a good job.

2045
02:26:34,788 --> 02:26:40,633
[SPEAKER_27]: He's worked for the people, and he's worked for me, and I was a nuisance many times.

2046
02:26:41,253 --> 02:26:43,495
[SPEAKER_27]: So publicly, I want to thank him.

2047
02:26:47,463 --> 02:26:49,824
[SPEAKER_27]: And I hope we resolve the parking.

2048
02:26:50,224 --> 02:26:56,227
[SPEAKER_27]: But I will tell you that it's more the new parking company than anywhere else.

2049
02:26:56,767 --> 02:26:58,468
[SPEAKER_27]: They don't listen to anyone.

2050
02:26:59,268 --> 02:27:01,449
[SPEAKER_27]: And they try to pass it back to the city.

2051
02:27:01,989 --> 02:27:03,970
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's my take on it.

2052
02:27:04,230 --> 02:27:04,651
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2053
02:27:08,552 --> 02:27:08,792
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.

2054
02:27:08,872 --> 02:27:10,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2055
02:27:11,754 --> 02:27:12,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2056
02:27:12,774 --> 02:27:13,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Bob Capucci, 71 Evans Street,

2057
02:27:15,417 --> 02:27:22,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to be really brief because I know other people are waiting to come and speak about other agenda items.

2058
02:27:22,242 --> 02:27:24,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to thank Ms.

2059
02:27:24,604 --> 02:27:30,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Brady for coming up and bringing this up, for Councilor Penta's remarks and for Chief Sacco's remarks.

2060
02:27:31,489 --> 02:27:39,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, we all, everybody in this body, everybody that works in this building, we all have a passion and love for Medford, but this pay-to-park kiosk program

2061
02:27:40,455 --> 02:27:46,780
[SPEAKER_07]: The way it was implemented and the way it's been working, or a lack thereof, is disastrous for the city of Medford.

2062
02:27:48,021 --> 02:28:03,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I have been working on another project, and a week ago from Saturday, I started at the end of Salem Street, where it intersects with the Fellsway, before Malden, and I stalked at Forest Street, just taking pictures of businesses that were once there that are gone now.

2063
02:28:03,654 --> 02:28:08,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I have pictures of over 20 businesses in that eight block radius that are gone now.

2064
02:28:09,935 --> 02:28:16,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not blaming that on the pay-to-park kiosk program, but with all due respect, we're talking about being realistic.

2065
02:28:17,458 --> 02:28:31,122
[SPEAKER_07]: The small businesses in this community that provide the jobs and this city makes money off of through sales tax and mails tax and whatnot are the reasons why, partly, we have a surplus.

2066
02:28:31,322 --> 02:28:38,085
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we focused, you know, hindsight's 20-20, but if we focused years ago on

2067
02:28:39,823 --> 02:28:52,492
[SPEAKER_07]: going to bat in supporting small businesses, and we didn't lose these 20 businesses, we would have had the funding for Chief Sacco to have a full and adequate police force.

2068
02:28:52,812 --> 02:28:53,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, God bless him.

2069
02:28:53,612 --> 02:28:56,594
[SPEAKER_07]: He's doing the best he can with the manpower he has.

2070
02:28:57,195 --> 02:29:05,180
[SPEAKER_07]: And with the national feeling going on about police officers in general in the country, he deserves a real

2071
02:29:05,653 --> 02:29:07,454
[SPEAKER_07]: applaud him and every officer.

2072
02:29:07,834 --> 02:29:25,521
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we had the full and adequate police force built upon providing the support that we can to these small businesses going back years ago, it's not that the business owners are parking in front of their businesses.

2073
02:29:25,821 --> 02:29:29,362
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem was in the past was that because Chief Sacco doesn't have

2074
02:29:30,065 --> 02:29:36,146
[SPEAKER_07]: an adequate police force to enforce the laws that are already on the books for traffic enforcement.

2075
02:29:36,366 --> 02:29:43,728
[SPEAKER_07]: We have people from other cities and towns coming here, parking all day right in front of these businesses, and then getting on the T and going to work.

2076
02:29:44,008 --> 02:29:51,950
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the real problem, not the business owners parking in front of their places of establishment all day long.

2077
02:29:53,170 --> 02:29:58,231
[SPEAKER_07]: The gentleman who owns the gas station right across from the West Medford post office,

2078
02:30:00,373 --> 02:30:12,020
[SPEAKER_07]: A few weeks ago, I was talking to him and he said, you come out here at 11 o'clock in the morning and you look up this street that was once parked with cars and all these small businesses were making money off, it's gone now.

2079
02:30:12,581 --> 02:30:21,306
[SPEAKER_07]: We're losing money, businesses, jobs, revenues being collected because of this pay to park kiosk program.

2080
02:30:21,566 --> 02:30:27,470
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hope that the next mayoral administration will exercise the buyout option and get rid of it

2081
02:30:28,233 --> 02:30:33,962
[SPEAKER_07]: provide the infrastructure and support for small businesses to take the place of these 20 businesses that are on this phone right now.

2082
02:30:34,223 --> 02:30:35,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll email you the pictures if you want.

2083
02:30:36,847 --> 02:30:42,737
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have that level of economic engine activity again.

2084
02:30:43,390 --> 02:31:04,719
[SPEAKER_07]: And with the two surpluses we have, with all that money coming in, we can hire a full police force for Chief Sackle to get the officers out there, not even to mention all the construction programs that are going on, to have Chief Sackle with a full police force to implement the traffic laws that are already on hand, then we wouldn't be experiencing a lot of these problems, in my opinion.

2085
02:31:04,959 --> 02:31:06,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

2086
02:31:06,940 --> 02:31:07,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Senator.

2087
02:31:08,440 --> 02:31:08,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

2088
02:31:09,141 --> 02:31:10,061
[SPEAKER_13]: Move approval, Mr. President.

2089
02:31:10,534 --> 02:31:16,878
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of approval of the main motion of Councilor Langley-Kern as amended by Councilors Knight and Karafiello.

2090
02:31:17,479 --> 02:31:19,180
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's it.

2091
02:31:19,340 --> 02:31:20,021
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

2092
02:31:20,641 --> 02:31:21,942
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

2093
02:31:21,982 --> 02:31:23,023
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, we're in suspension.

2094
02:31:23,043 --> 02:31:28,506
[SPEAKER_17]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks to take a paper out of order.

2095
02:31:28,526 --> 02:31:39,254
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Mr. President, paper 15-591, on order $2,120 for capital approvals to the city sewer system.

2096
02:31:39,883 --> 02:31:45,885
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of Council Marks to take paper for the final reading, paper number 15591.

2097
02:31:50,287 --> 02:31:50,988
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

2098
02:31:54,309 --> 02:31:56,610
[SPEAKER_18]: We're getting there.

2099
02:31:56,630 --> 02:31:56,610
15591.

2100
02:31:58,491 --> 02:32:00,231
[SPEAKER_18]: This was in committee of the whole.

2101
02:32:00,431 --> 02:32:05,453
[SPEAKER_18]: We have the third reading before us.

2102
02:32:05,473 --> 02:32:06,714
[SPEAKER_18]: This was a paper presented

2103
02:32:07,418 --> 02:32:09,299
[SPEAKER_18]: to the Council at the last Council meeting.

2104
02:32:09,359 --> 02:32:13,282
[SPEAKER_18]: It had its second reading by advertisement and now it's up for its third reading.

2105
02:32:13,803 --> 02:32:26,772
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a request for a loan order of $2,120,000 that will be expended upon improvements to sewer and drainage in North Medford.

2106
02:32:28,133 --> 02:32:33,817
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a loan from the Mass Water Resource Authority, MWRA, that

2107
02:32:35,314 --> 02:32:47,965
[SPEAKER_18]: Its components are a 45% grant, so once we receive the loan, 45% of it is a grant, and 55% of it is repayable over a five-year period at 0% interest.

2108
02:32:48,086 --> 02:32:48,506
[SPEAKER_18]: So $1,000,000, was it $166,000?

2109
02:32:56,654 --> 02:33:01,437
[SPEAKER_18]: $666,000 is repayable over a five-year period.

2110
02:33:01,877 --> 02:33:14,607
[SPEAKER_18]: In our deliberations in the committee of the whole, we moved approval with the caveat that that repaid amount be taken out of the sewer enterprise account.

2111
02:33:15,628 --> 02:33:22,853
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we have a motion on the floor for this, Councilor Penta.

2112
02:33:26,976 --> 02:33:28,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do this one more time.

2113
02:33:28,796 --> 02:33:36,518
[SPEAKER_09]: On an annual basis, we are charged a water and sewer dollar amount from the MWRA, correct?

2114
02:33:37,358 --> 02:33:38,039
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct.

2115
02:33:39,019 --> 02:33:39,619
[SPEAKER_06]: An assessment.

2116
02:33:40,119 --> 02:33:51,802
[SPEAKER_09]: And that assessment, and that's a result of what we as a community use for water by cubic feet, and we're back charged on the sewer side at 120% of the water bill.

2117
02:33:55,025 --> 02:33:56,246
[SPEAKER_06]: That may be the total amount.

2118
02:33:56,346 --> 02:34:04,228
[SPEAKER_06]: The water is based upon the amount of water that we use, whereas the sewer is based upon a number of different factors.

2119
02:34:04,248 --> 02:34:07,769
[SPEAKER_09]: But it comes out to the charge of 120% of our water bill.

2120
02:34:08,790 --> 02:34:11,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, you're asking us to vote for this.

2121
02:34:11,971 --> 02:34:17,753
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we have the committee to hold tonight where there was a whole bunch of explanations as to where and why these things are going.

2122
02:34:17,813 --> 02:34:20,974
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, my question is, why didn't we just do this earlier?

2123
02:34:21,385 --> 02:34:24,667
[SPEAKER_09]: We're only sitting on $7.5 million of money, but that's beside the point.

2124
02:34:26,167 --> 02:34:36,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Just looking and trying to understand this, if 45% of this loan is going to be a grant from the MWRA, correct?

2125
02:34:37,232 --> 02:34:37,933
[SPEAKER_09]: That is correct.

2126
02:34:38,013 --> 02:34:39,373
[SPEAKER_09]: The remaining 55%, which is $1,166,000, has to be repaid.

2127
02:34:39,413 --> 02:34:39,874
[SPEAKER_09]: That's correct.

2128
02:34:39,894 --> 02:34:40,594
[SPEAKER_09]: So as we are repaying them,

2129
02:34:51,190 --> 02:34:58,873
[SPEAKER_09]: during the next five years, we're also going to be assessed by them in the next five years for water and sewer charges, correct?

2130
02:34:59,273 --> 02:34:59,853
[SPEAKER_06]: That is correct.

2131
02:34:59,974 --> 02:35:00,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2132
02:35:01,514 --> 02:35:13,399
[SPEAKER_09]: So in essence, since we're already being charged an assessment for what we're using, we're really not getting this money for nothing because we're being charged.

2133
02:35:14,439 --> 02:35:17,541
[SPEAKER_09]: And even though this is an isolated project, which is costing $2.1 million,

2134
02:35:19,478 --> 02:35:20,358
[SPEAKER_09]: we have to pay back $1,168,000.

2135
02:35:20,878 --> 02:35:26,600
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been thinking about that from the time we left that room till over here.

2136
02:35:26,620 --> 02:35:30,100
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the city has one of two options.

2137
02:35:30,140 --> 02:35:45,243
[SPEAKER_09]: They either go this route or rather than saying, just pay it off over a five year period of time, since we're going to be taking it out of the sewer account for which is half of the water and sewer account.

2138
02:35:46,224 --> 02:35:47,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't we just pay it off the first year?

2139
02:35:48,140 --> 02:35:49,720
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have to pay it off one way or the other.

2140
02:35:51,581 --> 02:35:54,482
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess my question then comes to the council.

2141
02:35:54,502 --> 02:36:02,624
[SPEAKER_09]: I would probably move to amend not one to five years, Mr. President, pay it off within the first year, because you have to pay it off no matter what.

2142
02:36:03,604 --> 02:36:12,707
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't want to wait and procrastinate over five years and realize that I would want to know what my balance is now to go forward on any future endeavors that this might reveal.

2143
02:36:13,247 --> 02:36:14,847
[SPEAKER_09]: You said one to five years, correct?

2144
02:36:15,788 --> 02:36:16,888
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, I'm sorry?

2145
02:36:17,352 --> 02:36:20,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Up to 1 to 5 years, we could repay this back.

2146
02:36:20,954 --> 02:36:24,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, the way it is set up is that it would be a 5-year repayment.

2147
02:36:24,175 --> 02:36:25,056
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a 5-year repayment.

2148
02:36:25,076 --> 02:36:27,657
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can pay that anywhere up to 5 years.

2149
02:36:28,957 --> 02:36:32,619
[SPEAKER_06]: We could do that, but since it's a 0% interest.

2150
02:36:32,939 --> 02:36:34,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care about the 0%.

2151
02:36:34,880 --> 02:36:35,500
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that.

2152
02:36:36,081 --> 02:36:38,162
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're going to have to pay it back one way or the other.

2153
02:36:38,202 --> 02:36:42,644
[SPEAKER_09]: So why procrastinate and go through a 5-year, $275,000 deletion?

2154
02:36:42,924 --> 02:36:45,485
[SPEAKER_09]: I would rather have it taken out now and understand what my balance is.

2155
02:36:45,858 --> 02:36:47,459
[SPEAKER_09]: to go forward on other projects.

2156
02:36:47,919 --> 02:36:55,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if something comes up of a major concern, I'm going to then have to worry about $275,000 for year 2, 3, 4, and 5.

2157
02:36:55,363 --> 02:36:56,344
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't want to think about it.

2158
02:36:57,224 --> 02:37:02,887
[SPEAKER_09]: So the more I keep thinking about it, we're already being assessed on an annual basis.

2159
02:37:02,927 --> 02:37:14,013
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we're going to be assessed for the next five years on the sewer charge, and we're paying them back the money that they're loaning us, we're still paying out on their sewer portion of it.

2160
02:37:14,388 --> 02:37:15,308
[SPEAKER_09]: because we're being assessed.

2161
02:37:15,509 --> 02:37:27,875
[SPEAKER_09]: So, with that being said, I'm going to move, Mr. President, that since we are going to accept the grant, that we pay it back year one — within year one of this five-year loan.

2162
02:37:27,955 --> 02:37:28,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what you call it?

2163
02:37:29,016 --> 02:37:29,876
[SPEAKER_09]: A five-year loan moratorium?

2164
02:37:29,896 --> 02:37:30,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what it is?

2165
02:37:30,337 --> 02:37:30,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

2166
02:37:30,437 --> 02:37:31,217
[SPEAKER_09]: DeParle That is a five-year loan.

2167
02:37:31,237 --> 02:37:32,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Schultz Within the five-year loan.

2168
02:37:34,099 --> 02:37:44,304
[SPEAKER_09]: And I move on that question, Mr. President, because I just think, you know, it terminates the whole issue of over a five-year period of time, and it also terminates the fact that over the next four to five years, after the first year,

2169
02:37:44,580 --> 02:37:47,382
[SPEAKER_09]: we have to delete $275,000 out of that account.

2170
02:37:47,942 --> 02:38:07,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Since we're going to have to pay for it anyway, we might as well just get rid of it up front and deal with the remaining balance that we have.

2171
02:38:07,996 --> 02:38:09,798
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion of approval by Councilor Penta.

2172
02:38:10,738 --> 02:38:12,900
[SPEAKER_18]: We have also part of the committee report

2173
02:38:13,672 --> 02:38:31,001
[SPEAKER_18]: that the engineer provide a listing of the streets in the North Medford project, that the mayor utilize Waterloo sewer enterprise account in future projects, that a percentage of infiltration and inflow be reported back to us, and how much?

2174
02:38:38,218 --> 02:38:41,819
[SPEAKER_16]: and how much has been allocated from the MWRA in total.

2175
02:38:42,439 --> 02:38:43,319
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have all that.

2176
02:38:43,999 --> 02:39:02,024
[SPEAKER_18]: And now we have Councilor Penta has moved approval and that this debt of $1,166,000 be not only paid from the Sue Enterprise account, but it be done so within the first year.

2177
02:39:03,404 --> 02:39:06,965
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion for approval, Mr. Stroller wants to speak.

2178
02:39:12,838 --> 02:39:18,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I hope you'll be patient with me.

2179
02:39:19,183 --> 02:39:26,528
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to sort of sort this out and explain this, if I don't sound condescending to the council.

2180
02:39:27,629 --> 02:39:30,992
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand why we are taking out a loan.

2181
02:39:31,072 --> 02:39:35,215
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what this is, is a loan, when we've already paid for it.

2182
02:39:36,296 --> 02:39:37,577
[SPEAKER_08]: The Water and Sewer Commission

2183
02:39:38,672 --> 02:39:44,656
[SPEAKER_08]: has raised our rates with the knowledge that we were going to need improvements on this.

2184
02:39:45,196 --> 02:39:46,497
[SPEAKER_08]: We've already paid for it.

2185
02:39:47,338 --> 02:39:49,579
[SPEAKER_08]: We have $6 million there.

2186
02:39:51,361 --> 02:39:55,203
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we paid this, we'd still have $4 million.

2187
02:39:55,263 --> 02:39:57,105
[SPEAKER_08]: We may have more than the $6 million.

2188
02:39:58,806 --> 02:40:03,409
[SPEAKER_08]: But somehow, this council thinks there's a free lunch.

2189
02:40:04,390 --> 02:40:06,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anyone here think there's a free lunch?

2190
02:40:06,831 --> 02:40:07,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Any one of you councilors?

2191
02:40:08,828 --> 02:40:15,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I've heard one Councilor say, hey, we're getting $950,000 for nothing.

2192
02:40:15,773 --> 02:40:17,214
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not getting that for nothing.

2193
02:40:17,395 --> 02:40:23,719
[SPEAKER_08]: We've already been assessed $18 million, so we're getting back our own money.

2194
02:40:24,780 --> 02:40:30,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the law says that in order to pass a loan order, and that's what this is,

2195
02:40:32,602 --> 02:40:41,285
[SPEAKER_08]: This is, if you read what the mayor has proposed, it says here, to borrow said sum and to issue bonds for the amount of $2,120,000.

2196
02:40:41,685 --> 02:40:45,467
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not for $1,600,000.

2197
02:40:46,427 --> 02:40:48,067
[SPEAKER_08]: It's for $2 million.

2198
02:40:48,388 --> 02:40:59,171
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a rule saying that on the third reading, and this is the third reading, you don't have a majority vote any longer.

2199
02:40:59,712 --> 02:41:00,672
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how important.

2200
02:41:01,140 --> 02:41:02,560
[SPEAKER_08]: The law thinks this is.

2201
02:41:04,061 --> 02:41:07,402
[SPEAKER_08]: The law does not think that people ought to be burned with debt.

2202
02:41:07,662 --> 02:41:08,562
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what this is.

2203
02:41:08,662 --> 02:41:09,242
[SPEAKER_08]: It's debt.

2204
02:41:09,703 --> 02:41:11,443
[SPEAKER_08]: You would not run a business like this.

2205
02:41:13,043 --> 02:41:19,385
[SPEAKER_08]: So it says, instead of the usual majority vote, now you've got to have a two-thirds vote.

2206
02:41:20,566 --> 02:41:28,328
[SPEAKER_08]: So why did the law say that, hey, usually you can go past anything with just a majority vote, but now, hey, you've got to have five votes?

2207
02:41:29,095 --> 02:41:38,757
[SPEAKER_08]: So if only three members of this council vote against this, it will not pass, and we will not have that debt, which the people should not have.

2208
02:41:39,417 --> 02:41:41,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Why should they pay this money twice?

2209
02:41:42,938 --> 02:41:49,340
[SPEAKER_08]: They paid it once when the Water and Soil Commission decided to increase our rates, and our rates are increased.

2210
02:41:53,385 --> 02:41:57,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't think that the MWRA did not know we were going to make these improvements.

2211
02:41:57,388 --> 02:41:59,249
[SPEAKER_08]: They added that into their assessment.

2212
02:41:59,550 --> 02:42:01,031
[SPEAKER_08]: We've already paid for this.

2213
02:42:01,471 --> 02:42:02,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we're going to pay twice.

2214
02:42:03,773 --> 02:42:06,475
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what's wrong with the tax structure in this city.

2215
02:42:06,935 --> 02:42:15,341
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why taxes are raised to the maximum, the maximum, every year for 28 years relentlessly.

2216
02:42:16,943 --> 02:42:19,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, that tells you what the tax structure does.

2217
02:42:19,544 --> 02:42:22,827
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is, in microcosm, more of that.

2218
02:42:23,865 --> 02:42:26,027
[SPEAKER_08]: We are perpetuating that tax system.

2219
02:42:26,767 --> 02:42:27,648
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a tax system.

2220
02:42:27,688 --> 02:42:29,329
[SPEAKER_08]: We always go to the maximum.

2221
02:42:29,369 --> 02:42:34,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, people say, hey, well, one year, we didn't go to the maximum.

2222
02:42:34,573 --> 02:42:36,695
[SPEAKER_08]: We saved ourselves $50,000.

2223
02:42:37,176 --> 02:42:42,460
[SPEAKER_08]: But according to Proposition 2.5, you recover that and more the very next year.

2224
02:42:43,160 --> 02:42:44,962
[SPEAKER_08]: We never run out of that maximum.

2225
02:42:45,962 --> 02:42:48,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Why must we always have the maximum in taxes?

2226
02:42:49,265 --> 02:42:50,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we have debt.

2227
02:42:51,627 --> 02:42:52,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anyone here know?

2228
02:42:53,612 --> 02:42:55,273
[SPEAKER_08]: what the debt in Medford is.

2229
02:42:56,154 --> 02:42:57,314
[SPEAKER_08]: You're the city councilors.

2230
02:42:57,695 --> 02:42:58,815
[SPEAKER_08]: You're concerned with debt.

2231
02:42:59,296 --> 02:43:01,457
[SPEAKER_08]: The debt is borne by the people.

2232
02:43:02,017 --> 02:43:03,118
[SPEAKER_08]: They pay the taxes.

2233
02:43:03,798 --> 02:43:05,399
[SPEAKER_08]: They are separated from their money.

2234
02:43:06,980 --> 02:43:12,964
[SPEAKER_08]: City decides how to spend that money, sometimes correctly, often foolishly.

2235
02:43:13,785 --> 02:43:14,845
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll all agree to that.

2236
02:43:15,566 --> 02:43:16,927
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we're trying to control.

2237
02:43:17,467 --> 02:43:18,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, here we are.

2238
02:43:18,448 --> 02:43:19,788
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going into debt again.

2239
02:43:20,769 --> 02:43:22,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Going into debt, that's what we're doing.

2240
02:43:22,829 --> 02:43:24,750
[SPEAKER_08]: And we place that burden on the people.

2241
02:43:26,570 --> 02:43:33,292
[SPEAKER_08]: So the $950,000, as one Councilor here keeps repeating, is a grant.

2242
02:43:33,532 --> 02:43:34,552
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not a grant.

2243
02:43:35,112 --> 02:43:37,133
[SPEAKER_08]: It is our money coming back to us.

2244
02:43:37,293 --> 02:43:39,714
[SPEAKER_08]: We've already given it to the MWRA.

2245
02:43:39,994 --> 02:43:41,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Now they're giving it back to us and giving a grant.

2246
02:43:42,054 --> 02:43:42,815
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the hook.

2247
02:43:43,535 --> 02:43:44,235
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the bait.

2248
02:43:45,725 --> 02:43:46,886
[SPEAKER_08]: And the city council bites.

2249
02:43:47,626 --> 02:43:48,306
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like fish.

2250
02:43:49,066 --> 02:43:50,027
[SPEAKER_08]: You love that bait.

2251
02:43:50,827 --> 02:43:53,508
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like free money, but there is no free lunch.

2252
02:43:53,989 --> 02:43:54,989
[SPEAKER_08]: We all agree to that.

2253
02:43:56,129 --> 02:44:06,714
[SPEAKER_08]: So I say the city council needs only three votes to not pass this and should not pass it, because we already have the money.

2254
02:44:07,414 --> 02:44:13,597
[SPEAKER_08]: As Councilor Pat has said repeatedly, there's $6 to $7 million there just sitting there.

2255
02:44:14,700 --> 02:44:15,781
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what it's for.

2256
02:44:16,561 --> 02:44:26,086
[SPEAKER_08]: That money was charged to the ratepayers for the purpose of paying for this very sore capital expenditure.

2257
02:44:27,167 --> 02:44:31,749
[SPEAKER_08]: So in order to pay for this, taxes must rise.

2258
02:44:31,789 --> 02:44:36,232
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why we have taxes raised every single year.

2259
02:44:37,413 --> 02:44:43,356
[SPEAKER_08]: So I say to this, I think the people in Medford are adults.

2260
02:44:44,650 --> 02:44:45,830
[SPEAKER_08]: They ought to be told the truth.

2261
02:44:48,031 --> 02:45:01,513
[SPEAKER_08]: And the truth is that if the city council votes for this loan, and that's what it is, it's a loan, it's increasing debt, the city council is increasing their taxes.

2262
02:45:02,573 --> 02:45:04,654
[SPEAKER_08]: When tax time comes around, they wonder why.

2263
02:45:05,014 --> 02:45:06,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, why do we have to?

2264
02:45:06,674 --> 02:45:09,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, because you ought to pass all of these loans.

2265
02:45:11,015 --> 02:45:12,295
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have a debt.

2266
02:45:13,768 --> 02:45:16,369
[SPEAKER_08]: of $75 million.

2267
02:45:17,249 --> 02:45:18,289
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what our debt is.

2268
02:45:18,609 --> 02:45:24,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, we're going to add on another $2 million with this, so now it becomes $77 million.

2269
02:45:24,731 --> 02:45:35,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's okay, because the financial structure has been arranged such that every year, built into the budget,

2270
02:45:36,657 --> 02:45:40,878
[SPEAKER_08]: is a $7 million charge to pay for this debt.

2271
02:45:42,138 --> 02:45:44,039
[SPEAKER_08]: In 10 years, it's $70 million.

2272
02:45:44,339 --> 02:45:47,079
[SPEAKER_08]: With $70 million, we could build a police station.

2273
02:45:47,099 --> 02:45:48,499
[SPEAKER_08]: We could build a fire station.

2274
02:45:48,900 --> 02:45:50,800
[SPEAKER_08]: We could take care of the DPW.

2275
02:45:51,460 --> 02:45:53,200
[SPEAKER_08]: We can do all the things we want to do.

2276
02:45:53,800 --> 02:45:54,441
[SPEAKER_08]: So what do we do?

2277
02:45:54,481 --> 02:45:55,661
[SPEAKER_08]: We keep adding to the debt.

2278
02:45:56,021 --> 02:45:57,341
[SPEAKER_08]: We just keep adding to the debt.

2279
02:45:58,141 --> 02:46:00,082
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the people ought to be told this.

2280
02:46:02,262 --> 02:46:05,903
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to take a roll call vote on this.

2281
02:46:07,391 --> 02:46:13,153
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the people of method should be informed as to how this city council voted.

2282
02:46:15,233 --> 02:46:23,956
[SPEAKER_08]: There may be a mailing telling them how this city council voted on this and how this city council has raised their taxes again.

2283
02:46:25,636 --> 02:46:35,639
[SPEAKER_08]: And in addition to that, uh, the people will, will be told exactly who voted for this and who did not.

2284
02:46:36,717 --> 02:46:38,698
[SPEAKER_08]: The people who voted against it will get credit.

2285
02:46:40,440 --> 02:46:44,803
[SPEAKER_08]: The people who voted for it will not get credit.

2286
02:46:44,823 --> 02:47:04,218
[SPEAKER_13]: The Press I'm wondering if the people who vote in favor of this project are going to get credit for addressing the environmental concerns that the residents in the North Medford section of Medford have, because this project will address environmental concerns that they have relative to sewage in the community, Mr. President.

2287
02:47:05,272 --> 02:47:07,373
[SPEAKER_13]: I also think, in looking at this, that it makes financial sense.

2288
02:47:07,693 --> 02:47:09,353
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm going to vote in favor of this measure.

2289
02:47:09,753 --> 02:47:11,714
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to vote in favor of the measure as filed.

2290
02:47:12,894 --> 02:47:13,854
[SPEAKER_08]: You need not wonder.

2291
02:47:14,635 --> 02:47:15,975
[SPEAKER_08]: You need not wonder at all.

2292
02:47:16,195 --> 02:47:19,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we know that the capital improvements are needed.

2293
02:47:19,976 --> 02:47:21,136
[SPEAKER_08]: And we must go through with them.

2294
02:47:21,516 --> 02:47:22,817
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've already paid for them.

2295
02:47:23,097 --> 02:47:24,477
[SPEAKER_08]: But you want to pay for them twice.

2296
02:47:29,539 --> 02:47:33,860
[SPEAKER_13]: If I were going to buy a car, and I went into the dealership, and I said, I want to buy this $5,000 car.

2297
02:47:35,371 --> 02:47:36,432
[SPEAKER_13]: And they said, OK, you can buy it.

2298
02:47:36,452 --> 02:47:36,992
[SPEAKER_13]: And I said, here's the $5,000.

2299
02:47:37,453 --> 02:47:39,214
[SPEAKER_13]: And they said, no, no, no, no, no.

2300
02:47:40,335 --> 02:47:43,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't give me $5,000.

2301
02:47:43,457 --> 02:47:44,938
[SPEAKER_13]: Give me 55% of the $5,000.

2302
02:47:45,398 --> 02:47:52,944
[SPEAKER_13]: And finance that 55% of that $5,000 over five years at 0% interest, and we're right off the rest.

2303
02:47:53,604 --> 02:47:54,345
[SPEAKER_13]: You better be sure.

2304
02:47:54,905 --> 02:48:00,369
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to be the first guy in line, giving them the 55%, financing the other 45%, giving them the 45%, financing the money.

2305
02:48:05,363 --> 02:48:08,505
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a zero interest loan, Mr. President, over five years that we can pay it back.

2306
02:48:08,785 --> 02:48:10,346
[SPEAKER_13]: I know there's a contrary motion on the floor.

2307
02:48:10,366 --> 02:48:11,647
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't support the contrary motion.

2308
02:48:11,667 --> 02:48:18,392
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel as though the money should be paid back through our sewer enterprise account, which is flush, which has funds in it that are available to pay this down.

2309
02:48:18,812 --> 02:48:26,637
[SPEAKER_13]: We can pay it down over five years at 0% interest, and we're getting 45% of the total cost of the project reimbursed by the way of a grant.

2310
02:48:27,418 --> 02:48:29,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, we can fund it another way, and that's fine.

2311
02:48:29,860 --> 02:48:31,581
[SPEAKER_13]: But what we're going to do if we fund it another way is we're

2312
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:36,441
[SPEAKER_13]: reduce the overall budget in our sewer account by $2.1 million.

2313
02:48:36,461 --> 02:48:37,862
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not going to get any money back.

2314
02:48:38,402 --> 02:48:45,504
[SPEAKER_13]: And at the end of the day, we're going to be left with less money in there than we would have had if we went by the proposal that's in front of us right now.

2315
02:48:45,984 --> 02:48:50,525
[SPEAKER_13]: So I can certainly understand Dr. Stirella's concerns about having money in reserves.

2316
02:48:50,845 --> 02:48:59,847
[SPEAKER_13]: However, I think we can use the monies that are in reserves to leverage further projects, because they allow us to maintain a high bond rating, and they allow us to borrow at a lower rate.

2317
02:49:00,288 --> 02:49:01,768
[SPEAKER_13]: And in this instance, we're borrowing at a rate

2318
02:49:02,158 --> 02:49:04,379
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the lowest it can be, 0%, Mr. President.

2319
02:49:04,419 --> 02:49:06,101
[SPEAKER_13]: So I really think this is a good paper.

2320
02:49:06,121 --> 02:49:12,224
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that, actually, we might even have close to unanimous support behind the reel for the paper right now, Mr. President.

2321
02:49:12,244 --> 02:49:16,587
[SPEAKER_13]: So although I understand his concern to the taxpayer, I think that this makes good sense municipally.

2322
02:49:16,847 --> 02:49:18,308
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that this protects the taxpayer.

2323
02:49:18,328 --> 02:49:19,289
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it hurts the taxpayer.

2324
02:49:19,709 --> 02:49:22,911
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hope that Dr. Starrell is willing to share that as well in his mailing.

2325
02:49:23,231 --> 02:49:27,514
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think that the residents up in North Medford deserve the fact, deserve to have this work done.

2326
02:49:27,554 --> 02:49:29,335
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an infrastructure improvement that's necessary.

2327
02:49:29,655 --> 02:49:31,937
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the plan that's in place, and the plan's not going to change.

2328
02:49:31,957 --> 02:49:38,121
[SPEAKER_13]: We've already gone through that ordeal when we were here at the meeting last time, when we discussed whether or not the plan was going to change, what phase we were in.

2329
02:49:38,422 --> 02:49:41,744
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a subcommittee meeting, and we went through that all again, Mr. President.

2330
02:49:41,764 --> 02:49:44,626
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, in looking at it, the infrastructure repairs need to be done.

2331
02:49:44,946 --> 02:49:46,067
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a mechanism to fund it.

2332
02:49:46,107 --> 02:49:47,488
[SPEAKER_13]: The mechanism to fund it makes sense.

2333
02:49:47,949 --> 02:49:48,709
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we should move on.

2334
02:49:50,511 --> 02:49:51,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

2335
02:49:51,992 --> 02:49:52,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2336
02:49:54,033 --> 02:49:56,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, is he finished so I can have the floor?

2337
02:49:59,793 --> 02:50:01,234
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a question for the doctor.

2338
02:50:03,835 --> 02:50:04,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly, Ms.

2339
02:50:04,875 --> 02:50:05,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Counsel.

2340
02:50:05,456 --> 02:50:07,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I understand what you're saying.

2341
02:50:07,617 --> 02:50:14,920
[SPEAKER_10]: My question to you, then, because I understand the grant came from the previous year's assessments.

2342
02:50:15,060 --> 02:50:24,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, we were explained in the Committee of the Whole meeting that each community has a certain amount of money they can get from a grant through the MWRA.

2343
02:50:25,245 --> 02:50:27,426
[SPEAKER_10]: My question to you, then, is why would we not take it

2344
02:50:29,223 --> 02:50:30,083
[SPEAKER_10]: take advantage of that.

2345
02:50:30,704 --> 02:50:36,125
[SPEAKER_10]: I can see paying it back sooner than the five years, but why would we not take advantage of the 45 percent?

2346
02:50:36,826 --> 02:50:38,786
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not taking advantage of anything.

2347
02:50:39,187 --> 02:50:42,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Every single community is in the same position as we are in.

2348
02:50:42,608 --> 02:50:51,811
[SPEAKER_08]: If they give us some money in the form of a free quote-unquote grant, which it isn't, we have to emphasize that.

2349
02:50:52,373 --> 02:50:57,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, don't you think that we are contributing to all of their grants in return?

2350
02:50:57,394 --> 02:50:58,855
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not getting anything for nothing.

2351
02:50:59,335 --> 02:51:00,575
[SPEAKER_08]: They're giving us some money.

2352
02:51:01,396 --> 02:51:04,917
[SPEAKER_08]: In our assessment, we give back $18 million.

2353
02:51:05,657 --> 02:51:08,218
[SPEAKER_08]: But every other community is taking advantage of these grants.

2354
02:51:08,278 --> 02:51:15,100
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we're always going to be adding to it, why wouldn't we want to take advantage of the grants from now into the future?

2355
02:51:15,140 --> 02:51:16,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's just going to toll.

2356
02:51:17,242 --> 02:51:18,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we were explained, and I don't know if Ms.

2357
02:51:18,783 --> 02:51:23,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Miller can explain it a little further or back me up, because that's where my confusion is.

2358
02:51:23,324 --> 02:51:24,245
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand what you're saying.

2359
02:51:24,265 --> 02:51:32,468
[SPEAKER_10]: We paid for that over the years where it's tallied up, and now we can, you know, request the grant of, you know, it's going to be about a million dollars.

2360
02:51:32,988 --> 02:51:34,589
[SPEAKER_10]: But why wouldn't we take advantage of that?

2361
02:51:34,629 --> 02:51:41,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Why just let it toll up when we have projects that need to be done, and now we can take advantage of the, not free, but we can take advantage of the 45% grant?

2362
02:51:42,131 --> 02:51:42,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Not free.

2363
02:51:43,332 --> 02:51:46,033
[SPEAKER_08]: We should not cut off our nose to spite our face.

2364
02:51:46,916 --> 02:51:52,864
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go into debt because other communities are taking advantage of, quote, unquote, grants.

2365
02:51:53,505 --> 02:51:54,666
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not grants.

2366
02:51:54,867 --> 02:51:56,048
[SPEAKER_08]: They pay for them also.

2367
02:51:57,009 --> 02:51:58,752
[SPEAKER_08]: The MWRA knows what it's doing.

2368
02:51:59,653 --> 02:52:03,178
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as depriving North Medford, no one feels that way.

2369
02:52:04,553 --> 02:52:14,160
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as going into an auto dealership, when you went into that auto dealership and they told you that they were going to give you a 45% discount for nothing, huh?

2370
02:52:14,600 --> 02:52:22,045
[SPEAKER_08]: But you didn't realize that the week before you had gone there and given them the 45% in advance, you're getting back your own money.

2371
02:52:24,747 --> 02:52:26,729
[SPEAKER_08]: You forgot that you'd gone there the week before.

2372
02:52:32,839 --> 02:52:33,299
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree.

2373
02:52:34,480 --> 02:52:38,023
[SPEAKER_13]: In looking at the paper that's before us, we have a contrary point of view from a citizen.

2374
02:52:38,384 --> 02:52:44,789
[SPEAKER_13]: However, I think that the council has deliberated this matter to its extent, and I think it'll be appropriate for us to move the paper.

2375
02:52:44,809 --> 02:52:53,856
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Penta, as amended, Councilor Marks.

2376
02:52:53,956 --> 02:53:00,882
[SPEAKER_25]: Just if I could, because I have a lot of respect for Dr. Starella and his eagle eye for

2377
02:53:01,865 --> 02:53:03,606
[SPEAKER_25]: budgetary concerns in this community.

2378
02:53:03,626 --> 02:53:07,608
[SPEAKER_25]: I think I'm struggling with the same thing, doctor.

2379
02:53:07,649 --> 02:53:10,950
[SPEAKER_25]: We had a conversation prior to the council meeting.

2380
02:53:11,911 --> 02:53:24,098
[SPEAKER_25]: And I appreciate the fact that you're saying the 0% interest loans that the MWRA offers is all the community's money combined.

2381
02:53:25,359 --> 02:53:29,481
[SPEAKER_25]: And you're right, because the MWRA doesn't generate money on their own.

2382
02:53:31,618 --> 02:53:36,280
[SPEAKER_25]: rates and through charging communities rates for water and sewer.

2383
02:53:36,620 --> 02:53:49,664
[SPEAKER_25]: So you're right, that pool is money that's out there that's generated from my water and sewer consumption, your water, everyone, and not just in Method, throughout all the MWRA district.

2384
02:53:50,184 --> 02:53:51,385
[SPEAKER_25]: And you're absolutely right with that.

2385
02:53:52,185 --> 02:54:00,828
[SPEAKER_25]: And my only concern is that if there is a grant out there, and at the end of this all being said and done,

2386
02:54:01,275 --> 02:54:06,559
[SPEAKER_25]: Dr. Estrella, and I know what you're saying.

2387
02:54:06,579 --> 02:54:11,703
[SPEAKER_25]: $954,000 of this project will not be taken from our $6 million reserve.

2388
02:54:13,164 --> 02:54:17,908
[SPEAKER_25]: It'll be given to us by the MWRA, which is money from all the communities.

2389
02:54:18,788 --> 02:54:20,690
[SPEAKER_25]: I see that as a win for our community.

2390
02:54:22,738 --> 02:54:26,463
[SPEAKER_25]: It's no different, in my opinion, when we built the new schools in this community.

2391
02:54:27,063 --> 02:54:33,271
[SPEAKER_25]: You could say the same thing with the reimbursement we got from the state, the state building assistance program with the new schools.

2392
02:54:33,872 --> 02:54:37,536
[SPEAKER_25]: Why would the state come in and give the city of Medford 90% to build new schools?

2393
02:54:38,386 --> 02:54:43,508
[SPEAKER_25]: And you're right, that's every taxpayer in the commonwealth's money that's in that state building assistance.

2394
02:54:43,868 --> 02:54:47,009
[SPEAKER_25]: But why as a community wouldn't we take advantage of that?

2395
02:54:47,849 --> 02:54:50,090
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's the only issue I'm struggling with.

2396
02:54:51,170 --> 02:54:55,272
[SPEAKER_25]: Why wouldn't we take advantage of the grant?

2397
02:54:55,992 --> 02:54:59,633
[SPEAKER_25]: I realize we paid into it, Malden paid into it, Somerville paid into it.

2398
02:55:00,073 --> 02:55:04,034
[SPEAKER_25]: Everyone paid into it, but why wouldn't we try to get our fair share of it?

2399
02:55:04,514 --> 02:55:16,416
[SPEAKER_25]: Rather than saying, you know what, we can afford out of the excess we have in the water and sewer, the surplus from all the rate payers paying too much for water and sewer over the years, we can take that $2 million out without a problem.

2400
02:55:16,436 --> 02:55:17,617
[SPEAKER_25]: That'll leave us with $4 million.

2401
02:55:18,197 --> 02:55:24,298
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm saying, let's only take $1,166,000 and let the MWRA give us the balance.

2402
02:55:24,658 --> 02:55:25,938
[SPEAKER_25]: Have to take the whole $2 million.

2403
02:55:26,938 --> 02:55:27,419
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, right.

2404
02:55:27,439 --> 02:55:28,459
[SPEAKER_25]: And then we get reimbursed.

2405
02:55:28,759 --> 02:55:29,719
[SPEAKER_25]: And then we get reimbursed.

2406
02:55:31,986 --> 02:55:33,467
[SPEAKER_25]: I just think it's a difference of opinion.

2407
02:55:34,007 --> 02:55:37,629
[SPEAKER_25]: I really — I can't leave that on the table.

2408
02:55:38,110 --> 02:55:42,032
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't leave that on the table and say, okay, we can afford it, let's do it on our own.

2409
02:55:43,733 --> 02:55:45,474
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'd take it one step further.

2410
02:55:45,494 --> 02:55:47,715
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't even agree with saying that's paid off right away.

2411
02:55:48,396 --> 02:55:58,262
[SPEAKER_25]: If I'm not paying interest on that, why would I — if I had money in the bank and I don't have to pay interest on purchasing something, why wouldn't I want to leave that money in the bank collecting interest?

2412
02:56:00,049 --> 02:56:02,590
[SPEAKER_25]: It just, I don't know, I have some real concerns.

2413
02:56:04,011 --> 02:56:11,534
[SPEAKER_25]: As Councilor Knight mentioned, I've been talking about water and sewer infrastructure since I've been on the council, 14 years now.

2414
02:56:12,574 --> 02:56:16,476
[SPEAKER_25]: And I've been talking about the lack of infrastructure because it's under the ground and so forth.

2415
02:56:16,696 --> 02:56:19,237
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been talking about INI, inflow and infiltration.

2416
02:56:19,277 --> 02:56:19,917
[SPEAKER_25]: And you're correct.

2417
02:56:20,437 --> 02:56:22,818
[SPEAKER_25]: And so I know these projects are needed.

2418
02:56:22,838 --> 02:56:26,679
[SPEAKER_25]: I think you know and I think everyone behind this reeling realize these projects are needed.

2419
02:56:27,080 --> 02:56:28,240
[SPEAKER_25]: With this particular project,

2420
02:56:28,543 --> 02:56:36,086
[SPEAKER_25]: We have catch basins right now that are supposed to collect runoff rain when it rains out and sends it to the Mystic River.

2421
02:56:36,506 --> 02:56:39,367
[SPEAKER_25]: We have them directly connected to our sewer system.

2422
02:56:39,947 --> 02:56:45,589
[SPEAKER_25]: So anytime it rains, rather than that go out to the Mystic, we're taking it and sending it out to Deer Island.

2423
02:56:46,310 --> 02:56:48,631
[SPEAKER_25]: So you can imagine the volume.

2424
02:56:48,971 --> 02:56:54,293
[SPEAKER_25]: We have about 16 connections in the community right now that are directly connected to our sewer system.

2425
02:56:54,693 --> 02:56:56,073
[SPEAKER_25]: This is going to address six of them.

2426
02:56:56,694 --> 02:56:57,434
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, it's not all of them.

2427
02:56:57,713 --> 02:56:59,153
[SPEAKER_25]: but it's going to address a portion of it.

2428
02:56:59,494 --> 02:57:04,915
[SPEAKER_25]: We're making some headway in the community on infrastructure that's been neglected for many years.

2429
02:57:05,415 --> 02:57:10,217
[SPEAKER_25]: If the mayor can neglect a building that we can see, imagine what he's neglecting under the ground.

2430
02:57:10,357 --> 02:57:11,437
[SPEAKER_25]: There's no argument there.

2431
02:57:12,077 --> 02:57:22,080
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, so, but these are the things that, you know, I just, I just have a problem with not going after a grant.

2432
02:57:22,481 --> 02:57:23,301
[SPEAKER_25]: And I know what you're saying.

2433
02:57:23,641 --> 02:57:24,861
[SPEAKER_25]: There's nothing free in this world.

2434
02:57:25,722 --> 02:57:26,942
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a grant out there.

2435
02:57:27,298 --> 02:57:34,462
[SPEAKER_25]: that we could take advantage of, and it doesn't — that $954,000 will not come out of our surplus.

2436
02:57:35,043 --> 02:57:37,785
[SPEAKER_25]: And under your thinking, it will come out of the surplus.

2437
02:57:40,606 --> 02:57:41,767
[SPEAKER_08]: I just can't put my hands around it.

2438
02:57:41,807 --> 02:57:44,109
[SPEAKER_08]: That word, grant, is used erroneously.

2439
02:57:44,689 --> 02:57:45,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Grant means to give.

2440
02:57:46,550 --> 02:57:48,171
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not being given anything.

2441
02:57:48,811 --> 02:57:49,672
[SPEAKER_08]: It's our money.

2442
02:57:50,032 --> 02:57:54,155
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as the reserve, you say you don't want to tap the reserve?

2443
02:57:55,027 --> 02:57:57,049
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the very purpose of the reserve.

2444
02:57:57,069 --> 02:57:57,689
[SPEAKER_25]: No, no, no, doctor.

2445
02:57:57,749 --> 02:57:59,290
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not saying don't tap the reserve.

2446
02:57:59,330 --> 02:57:59,991
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, then we did.

2447
02:58:00,011 --> 02:58:07,196
[SPEAKER_25]: But I'm saying if we could tap the reserve and also tap the MWRA, which you're saying is our money, well, we could dispute that until the cows come home.

2448
02:58:07,456 --> 02:58:08,317
[SPEAKER_25]: Cannot dispute it.

2449
02:58:08,697 --> 02:58:10,218
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I think it's disputable.

2450
02:58:10,258 --> 02:58:10,959
[SPEAKER_08]: It is our money.

2451
02:58:11,319 --> 02:58:12,140
[SPEAKER_25]: It's everyone's money.

2452
02:58:12,660 --> 02:58:14,201
[SPEAKER_25]: It's 54 cities and towns.

2453
02:58:14,842 --> 02:58:16,143
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's not just the city of Medford.

2454
02:58:16,163 --> 02:58:18,324
[SPEAKER_25]: That wasn't money put aside just for the city of Medford.

2455
02:58:18,344 --> 02:58:22,728
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor once said to me, John, my lad, he said, I want to tell you something.

2456
02:58:23,330 --> 02:58:26,191
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, all revenue comes from taxes.

2457
02:58:28,593 --> 02:58:28,833
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

2458
02:58:29,273 --> 02:58:30,613
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't dispute that.

2459
02:58:30,714 --> 02:58:31,474
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's all money.

2460
02:58:31,814 --> 02:58:31,954
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

2461
02:58:32,314 --> 02:58:33,735
[SPEAKER_25]: And so was the building of new schools.

2462
02:58:33,875 --> 02:58:34,435
[SPEAKER_25]: It was our money.

2463
02:58:34,495 --> 02:58:37,937
[SPEAKER_25]: So I guess we didn't get 90 percent on the dollar with the new schools.

2464
02:58:38,417 --> 02:58:43,420
[SPEAKER_25]: And maybe we should raise taxes in the community to raise that hundred and something million dollars.

2465
02:58:44,040 --> 02:58:44,200
[SPEAKER_25]: But

2466
02:58:44,781 --> 02:58:46,282
[SPEAKER_25]: We thought better of it.

2467
02:58:46,302 --> 02:58:47,342
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a different subject.

2468
02:58:47,562 --> 02:58:49,483
[SPEAKER_08]: New schools is a completely different subject.

2469
02:58:49,503 --> 02:58:50,784
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same content.

2470
02:58:50,904 --> 02:58:52,544
[SPEAKER_08]: There are advantages and disadvantages.

2471
02:58:52,604 --> 02:58:53,685
[SPEAKER_08]: We got busing with that.

2472
02:58:54,725 --> 02:58:56,206
[SPEAKER_08]: We got busing with the new schools.

2473
02:58:56,306 --> 02:58:58,727
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to focus on the matter before us.

2474
02:58:59,227 --> 02:59:01,868
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much, councillor.

2475
02:59:02,028 --> 02:59:03,769
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, doctor.

2476
02:59:03,809 --> 02:59:06,230
The question has been moved.

2477
02:59:06,630 --> 02:59:13,173
[SPEAKER_18]: The matter brought to us in the way that councillor Pentez presented it tonight.

2478
02:59:13,668 --> 02:59:16,770
[SPEAKER_18]: is contrary to the way it was reported out of committee.

2479
02:59:18,311 --> 02:59:30,379
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to take your amendment separately, Councilor, and your amendment was that that be paid in one year, within the first year, Councilor.

2480
02:59:30,399 --> 02:59:38,385
[SPEAKER_09]: That be paid within the first year because if we're going to delay it over a five-year period of time, I think what that's going to do, I think that's going to

2481
02:59:38,901 --> 02:59:55,807
[SPEAKER_09]: limit whatever might become as a future project by almost a million dollars and I would rather know up front that that million dollars was gone beginning the second year and just dealing with the residue that's there because I don't want to deal with an uncertainty of a particular project in years two, three, four, or five.

2482
02:59:57,288 --> 02:59:59,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

2483
02:59:59,309 --> 03:00:04,351
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, rather than, and I can understand where the council is coming from, but I don't agree.

2484
03:00:05,391 --> 03:00:07,552
[SPEAKER_32]: I would rather have that million dollars in the bank

2485
03:00:08,171 --> 03:00:21,115
[SPEAKER_32]: collecting interest for the taxpayers, knowing that it's encumbered for a specific reason, which is the repayment of the loan, but at least have it in an interest-bearing account, which it is.

2486
03:00:22,215 --> 03:00:22,576
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

2487
03:00:23,176 --> 03:00:30,838
[SPEAKER_17]: So on the amendment of Councilor Penta, on the amendment of Councilor Penta to pay it off in one year, all those in favor?

2488
03:00:37,986 --> 03:00:38,386
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call.

03:00:38,426 --> 03:00:39,326
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed.

[SPEAKER_18]: Chairs in doubt, please call the roll on the amendment of Councilor Penta.

[SPEAKER_19]: No.

2495
03:00:50,929 --> 03:00:51,449
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight?

2496
03:00:51,609 --> 03:00:51,789

2497
03:00:52,890 --> 03:00:53,790

[SPEAKER_18]: No.

2501
03:00:56,711 --> 03:00:57,311
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Peca?

2502
03:00:57,371 --> 03:00:57,531
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2503
03:00:59,163 --> 03:01:05,665
[SPEAKER_18]: No, in the vote of six in the negative, one in the affirmative, the amendment passes.

2504
03:01:05,865 --> 03:01:17,008
[SPEAKER_18]: Now on the paper reported out in the committee for approval that the loan ought to be taken with the amount of money that is due, the $1 million.

2505
03:01:21,065 --> 03:01:28,649
[SPEAKER_18]: 166,000 be paid out at 0% out of the sewer enterprise account.

2506
03:01:29,129 --> 03:01:33,572
[SPEAKER_18]: And the other aforementioned pieces that were reported out as well.

2507
03:01:35,013 --> 03:01:38,074
[SPEAKER_18]: And we need a roll call vote on this as it is a loan order.

2508
03:01:38,214 --> 03:01:39,775
[SPEAKER_09]: It's within the five year period of time.

2509
03:01:39,955 --> 03:01:40,876
[SPEAKER_09]: You forgot the five years.

2510
03:01:41,776 --> 03:01:42,077
[SPEAKER_18]: What's that?

2511
03:01:42,237 --> 03:01:43,077
[SPEAKER_09]: You forgot the five years.

2512
03:01:43,558 --> 03:01:44,978
[SPEAKER_18]: Within the five year period of time.

2513
03:01:47,340 --> 03:01:47,500
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

2514
03:01:48,691 --> 03:01:50,371
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the terms of the original paper.

2515
03:01:51,332 --> 03:01:53,852
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's the committee paper that was amended.

2516
03:01:53,892 --> 03:01:55,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

2517
03:01:56,373 --> 03:01:56,933
[SPEAKER_18]: We have that up.

[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2527

[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2528
03:02:11,816 --> 03:02:16,017
[SPEAKER_18]: With the vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the law and order is passed.

2529
03:02:19,833 --> 03:02:24,357
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso, while we're on suspension, to take.

2530
03:02:25,158 --> 03:02:27,340
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President, could we just allow a citizen to speak?

2531
03:02:27,360 --> 03:02:30,803
[SPEAKER_07]: He was caught in the process.

2532
03:02:32,324 --> 03:02:33,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor.

2533
03:02:33,085 --> 03:02:34,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2534
03:02:35,006 --> 03:02:40,631
[SPEAKER_07]: About a year and a half ago, this council passed an amendment

2535
03:02:42,108 --> 03:02:49,513
[SPEAKER_07]: to appropriate $600,000 to give to the MWRA to keep our rates the same.

2536
03:02:49,593 --> 03:02:58,119
[SPEAKER_07]: The amendment passed, but then there was a dispute about it, but the budget was signed with that amendment passed for $600,000.

2537
03:02:58,619 --> 03:03:02,682
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was $618,000, something thereabouts.

2538
03:03:03,203 --> 03:03:06,885
[SPEAKER_07]: But Dr. Stirella brought up that the rates went up anyway.

2539
03:03:08,006 --> 03:03:09,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I came before this council.

2540
03:03:10,372 --> 03:03:17,457
[SPEAKER_07]: After that, and I specifically asked the question, now that this amendment passed, does that mean the water rate stayed the same?

2541
03:03:17,837 --> 03:03:19,959
[SPEAKER_07]: And the answer given to me was yes.

2542
03:03:20,479 --> 03:03:24,162
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I'm finding out that the water rates did, in fact, go up.

2543
03:03:25,803 --> 03:03:27,684
[SPEAKER_07]: And what happened to that $600,000?

2544
03:03:27,985 --> 03:03:30,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me explain what happened.

2545
03:03:30,146 --> 03:03:32,348
[SPEAKER_09]: What had happened was, yes, the council voted for it.

2546
03:03:32,428 --> 03:03:34,709
[SPEAKER_09]: It was taken out of the budget, and the rates weren't supposed to go up.

2547
03:03:35,330 --> 03:03:38,412
[SPEAKER_09]: But the Water and Sewer Commission changed the rate structure.

2548
03:03:39,128 --> 03:03:41,489
[SPEAKER_09]: into three separate tiers where before they were never.

2549
03:03:41,890 --> 03:03:49,994
[SPEAKER_09]: So as of last year, after our vote, the mayor empowered them to change the rate structure, for which they've changed twice since last year.

2550
03:03:50,294 --> 03:03:51,395
[SPEAKER_07]: So then what happened to that $600,000?

2551
03:03:51,575 --> 03:03:54,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess it's gone, huh?

2552
03:03:55,377 --> 03:04:01,060
[SPEAKER_07]: And now you're borrowing $2 million.

2553
03:04:01,080 --> 03:04:06,223
[SPEAKER_18]: 15-605, locations of poles, attachments, and fixtures in underground conduits.

2554
03:04:11,435 --> 03:04:23,339
[SPEAKER_18]: You are hereby notified that, by order of the Medford City Council, a public hearing will be given at the Howard F. Alden Memorial Auditorium, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, at 7 p.m.

2555
03:04:23,799 --> 03:04:35,322

[SPEAKER_18]: Pole will be labeled 402-85.

2561

[SPEAKER_18]: Wherefore it prays that after due notice and hearing, all provided by law, it be permissive,

2562

[SPEAKER_18]: It be permission to excavate the public highways and to run and maintain underground electric conduits together with such sustaining and protecting fixtures as it may find necessary for the transmission of electricity.

2563
03:05:17,587 --> 03:05:28,632
[SPEAKER_18]: Set underground conduits to be located substantially in accordance with the plan filed here with Mark National Grid Canal Street, Massachusetts number one nine zero three eight three three two.

2564
03:05:30,478 --> 03:05:30,678
[SPEAKER_18]: 4-27-2015.

[SPEAKER_18]: One, no city-owned or private utilities or other structures are adversely impacted.

[SPEAKER_18]: There will be no obstruction to the traveling public.

[SPEAKER_18]: The pole strut and guy will be installed per the attached tail.

[SPEAKER_18]: The sidewalk and any other city-owned property are restored.

[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

2581

[SPEAKER_18]: Anybody else in favor to present themselves for this matter?

2582

[SPEAKER_18]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare that portion of the public hearing closed.

2583
03:06:42,998 --> 03:06:46,601
[SPEAKER_18]: Anybody in opposition to this, please present yourself to the podium.

2584
03:06:53,466 --> 03:06:53,646

2585
03:06:54,227 --> 03:06:55,768
[SPEAKER_18]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2586
03:06:56,060 --> 03:06:58,421

03:07:00,221 --> 03:07:01,681
[SPEAKER_18]: Robert Hunter, 52 Canal Street.

2588
03:07:02,021 --> 03:07:02,381

[SPEAKER_18]: And you're in opposition.

2590
03:07:03,862 --> 03:07:05,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in opposition because- Thank you.

2591
03:07:06,662 --> 03:07:09,503
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, we have, uh, people in opposition.

2592
03:07:09,943 --> 03:07:12,384
[SPEAKER_18]: Anybody else in opposition, please present yourselves.

2593
03:07:12,824 --> 03:07:16,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Hearing, seeing none, we declare that portion of the public hearing closed.

2594
03:07:18,025 --> 03:07:19,225
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, you're here in opposition.

2595
03:07:19,285 --> 03:07:21,786
[SPEAKER_18]: Please present your reasons to the city council.

2596
03:07:23,326 --> 03:07:24,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I say my reasons.

2597
03:07:24,149 --> 03:07:24,973
[SPEAKER_18]: No, now you're gonna do it.

2598
03:07:25,757 --> 03:07:27,444
[SPEAKER_18]: It's done in parts, I apologize.

2599
03:07:29,361 --> 03:07:40,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, our house is right on the sidewalk and it seems that this pole would be right in front of our front door and it would be like having a pole right in our living rooms.

2600
03:07:41,652 --> 03:07:54,263
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we would rather not have it be right in front of our living rooms and are hoping that it can be moved to the property line on one side or the other or even further down the street opposite a different pole.

2601
03:07:56,822 --> 03:08:01,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it would affect the resale value of my property.

2602
03:08:02,086 --> 03:08:14,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it affects the tenant desirability of the property and just ease of getting in and out of the car right in front of the house to have a telephone pole right in front of the front steps, which is what it appears that they want to do.

2603
03:08:15,135 --> 03:08:15,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2604
03:08:16,657 --> 03:08:17,517
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm in agreement with Kim.

2605
03:08:18,138 --> 03:08:18,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2606
03:08:19,619 --> 03:08:23,782
[SPEAKER_18]: And the person in favor wish to make a presentation on the matter?

2607
03:08:26,237 --> 03:08:33,005
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're petitioning on setting a stealth pole across the street from an existing pole where our electric wires run through.

2608
03:08:35,628 --> 03:08:42,297
[SPEAKER_20]: As Kim said, the pole is going to obstruct the entrance and exit out of our house.

2609
03:08:43,238 --> 03:08:44,940
[SPEAKER_20]: We can look into an alternative location.

2610
03:08:45,752 --> 03:08:48,555
[SPEAKER_20]: We've moved it too close to the property line between the two houses.

2611
03:08:48,575 --> 03:08:51,117
[SPEAKER_20]: I can meet her in the field.

2612
03:08:51,137 --> 03:08:52,158
[SPEAKER_20]: We can work something out.

2613
03:08:52,178 --> 03:08:55,141
[SPEAKER_20]: I wouldn't want to pull in front of my house either.

2614
03:08:55,681 --> 03:09:02,767
[SPEAKER_20]: But for this matter, it's a concern for the pole that's existing across the street with the electric wires.

2615
03:09:02,787 --> 03:09:05,850
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't want it to fall over based on the tension of the wires.

2616
03:09:06,391 --> 03:09:10,174
[SPEAKER_20]: And we don't want to cause any outages because when it falls over, it's going to be live wires.

2617
03:09:11,994 --> 03:09:15,356
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, it's going to be dangerous to the neighborhood and to the people in the neighborhood.

2618
03:09:18,337 --> 03:09:18,678
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

2619
03:09:19,478 --> 03:09:22,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Camuso.

2620
03:09:22,220 --> 03:09:23,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead, Councilor, and I apologize.

2621
03:09:24,501 --> 03:09:26,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Sir, can you explain to me what a J.O.

2622
03:09:26,622 --> 03:09:27,843
[SPEAKER_20]: pole is with the strut guy?

2623
03:09:28,363 --> 03:09:28,963
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, J.O.

2624
03:09:29,003 --> 03:09:30,004
[SPEAKER_20]: is a jointly owned pole.

2625
03:09:30,224 --> 03:09:32,285
[SPEAKER_20]: It's both owned by National Grid and Verizon.

2626
03:09:33,749 --> 03:09:38,712
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a single pole, it's not a double pole, it's not adding a pole onto another pole with a strut that's attaching it or anything like that.

2627
03:09:38,752 --> 03:09:46,516
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it's a single pole, and what you see here from the existing pole, P402, going towards proposed pole P402-84.

2628
03:09:46,536 --> 03:09:50,938
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we don't have the same renderings, I think, that you have in front of you.

2629
03:09:50,978 --> 03:09:51,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

2630
03:09:53,799 --> 03:09:54,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me see it.

2631
03:10:02,610 --> 03:10:04,271
[SPEAKER_18]: So anyway, it's a single.

2632
03:10:04,331 --> 03:10:05,152
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much, sir.

2633
03:10:08,054 --> 03:10:12,438
[SPEAKER_20]: Support for P-402, existing with the green wires across at the corner.

2634
03:10:13,158 --> 03:10:20,784
[SPEAKER_20]: And the J-O pole that we're proposing is across the street in front of 52 Canal Street, P-402-84.

2635
03:10:21,284 --> 03:10:24,327
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a stub pole that we're petitioning on installing.

2636
03:10:24,347 --> 03:10:30,131
[SPEAKER_20]: Because of the angle of P-402, we don't want that pole to fall over due to the tension on the wires.

2637
03:10:32,373 --> 03:10:35,516
[SPEAKER_20]: And originally, we have a guy wired that's attached to a tree.

2638
03:10:36,898 --> 03:10:38,820
[SPEAKER_20]: Speaking with Kim, she said that the tree had been removed.

2639
03:10:39,260 --> 03:10:43,845
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's still an issue for the pole being fallen over.

2640
03:10:43,865 --> 03:10:47,769
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're proposing on setting that pole across the street.

2641
03:10:48,630 --> 03:10:51,713
[SPEAKER_13]: And in looking at this diagram here, we're at 52 and 52, 54, I guess, would be your problem.

2642
03:10:57,365 --> 03:10:58,106
[SPEAKER_13]: 54.

2643
03:10:57,585 --> 03:10:58,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2644
03:10:58,386 --> 03:11:07,815
[SPEAKER_13]: So you know, is there a driveway or something in, in regard to maybe in between the two houses here or anything like that, that would be blocked after Paul was moved to closer to the property line?

2645
03:11:10,917 --> 03:11:11,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Closer to.

2646
03:11:17,823 --> 03:11:19,905
[SPEAKER_13]: So does your home have a driveway?

2647
03:11:21,006 --> 03:11:21,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2648
03:11:21,427 --> 03:11:22,307
[SPEAKER_11]: And that would be closer to 50.

2649
03:11:24,190 --> 03:11:24,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2650
03:11:24,470 --> 03:11:24,850
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

2651
03:11:24,991 --> 03:11:25,171
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2652
03:11:25,191 --> 03:11:26,491
[SPEAKER_13]: And then so access to 5254.

2653
03:11:27,032 --> 03:11:27,432
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2654
03:11:35,397 --> 03:11:36,697
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2655
03:11:39,439 --> 03:11:46,843
[SPEAKER_13]: So have you spoke with your neighbors and this gentleman to figure out if there would be a compromise of some sort?

2656
03:11:48,304 --> 03:11:48,664
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2657
03:11:49,805 --> 03:11:50,005
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2658
03:11:50,025 --> 03:11:52,046
[SPEAKER_13]: So I didn't know if there might've been some sort of proposal.

2659
03:11:52,426 --> 03:11:52,507
[SPEAKER_13]: Um,

2660
03:11:54,700 --> 03:11:57,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, in terms of something that you guys can live with and discuss?

2661
03:11:57,922 --> 03:12:01,063
[SPEAKER_13]: And you'll make a commitment to going out there and meeting with them in the field?

2662
03:12:01,263 --> 03:12:01,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2663
03:12:02,924 --> 03:12:04,465
[SPEAKER_13]: So is there a motion on the floor?

2664
03:12:04,525 --> 03:12:13,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I'd ask that we hold the paper until we can take a look and see if there's a mutually agreeable site where the parties can put the poll and hold off on the approval until such.

2665
03:12:14,030 --> 03:12:14,350
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

2666
03:12:14,430 --> 03:12:16,952
[SPEAKER_18]: So on the motion of Council of Nine to table, all those in favor?

2667
03:12:16,972 --> 03:12:17,272
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

2668
03:12:17,612 --> 03:12:18,532
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

2669
03:12:18,833 --> 03:12:19,433
[SPEAKER_18]: That is tabled.

2670
03:12:22,382 --> 03:12:25,944
[SPEAKER_18]: While we're into suspension, we're going to take paper numbers.

2671
03:12:25,984 --> 03:12:32,188

03:17:15,045 --> 03:17:16,026
[SPEAKER_18]: Anybody in opposition?

2750
03:17:17,087 --> 03:17:18,027
[SPEAKER_18]: Anybody in opposition?

2751
03:17:18,107 --> 03:17:20,309
[SPEAKER_18]: Hearing seen none, this portion of the meeting is closed.

2752
03:17:21,549 --> 03:17:21,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Grid.

2753
03:17:24,819 --> 03:17:25,860
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell us about this project.

2754
03:17:26,880 --> 03:17:41,007
[SPEAKER_20]: We're proposing on repairing and installing two five-inch conduits between manhole MH8-177 to manhole MH8-157 due to its collapsing condition.

2755
03:17:42,087 --> 03:17:48,090
[SPEAKER_20]: We would like to replace it to install a new cable.

2756
03:17:50,231 --> 03:17:51,332
[SPEAKER_13]: Would you be so kind as to tell me

2757
03:17:51,870 --> 03:17:56,453
[SPEAKER_13]: How about how long the duration of this construction project will take?

2758
03:17:56,753 --> 03:18:00,856
[SPEAKER_20]: My knowledge of that depends on the underground crew that works on the job itself.

2759
03:18:02,297 --> 03:18:06,779
[SPEAKER_20]: It's 100 feet of conduit, a day or two at most.

2760
03:18:09,381 --> 03:18:10,262
[SPEAKER_20]: Two plus days, all right.

2761
03:18:10,322 --> 03:18:13,544
[SPEAKER_20]: And it'll most likely be done at nighttime rather than daytime during business hours.

2762
03:18:16,586 --> 03:18:18,047
[SPEAKER_15]: They're digging up the street on High Street.

2763
03:18:21,208 --> 03:18:22,769
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not digging across High Street.

2764
03:18:22,789 --> 03:18:27,732
[SPEAKER_20]: We're digging across Hillside Ave, which is perpendicular to High Street.

2765
03:18:28,012 --> 03:18:30,053
[SPEAKER_09]: How wide is the trench going to be?

2766
03:18:30,693 --> 03:18:41,719
[SPEAKER_20]: It's going to be about 2 to 5 feet, it looks like.

2767
03:18:41,739 --> 03:18:44,381
[SPEAKER_20]: It's about 36 inches wide, about 3 feet or less.

2768
03:18:45,121 --> 03:18:47,062
[SPEAKER_25]: Is the plan for you?

2769
03:18:53,382 --> 03:18:56,825
[SPEAKER_20]: As you can see, we'll be digging across Hillside Ave.

2770
03:18:56,845 --> 03:18:58,846
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're going to be almost in the middle of the street.

2771
03:18:59,767 --> 03:19:03,770
[SPEAKER_20]: It'll be closer to the curbside than the street on High Street.

2772
03:19:05,031 --> 03:19:09,675
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is it's it's it's a big concern because we don't want future outages and it's going to affect.

2773
03:19:10,296 --> 03:19:19,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to put a condition on here, Mr. President, that in six months that the city review the street opening to make sure that there were no depressions, because

2774
03:19:19,822 --> 03:19:28,088
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem with you folks lately, not you, because you're not digging the hole, is your company comes in and digs holes, and within six months, they just become depressed.

2775
03:19:29,108 --> 03:19:33,852
[SPEAKER_09]: And they sometimes can cause some of these potholes that are existing on some of these streets.

2776
03:19:33,872 --> 03:19:40,796
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we also have to look at, Mr. President, the bond amount that the city is charging right now.

2777
03:19:42,017 --> 03:19:49,102
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to raise it to $100,000 that your company has to leave here within the city of Medford, because if these streets need to be repaired, you know,

2778
03:19:49,671 --> 03:19:51,892
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys opened it, you should repair it to the way you found it.

2779
03:19:53,753 --> 03:19:54,754
[SPEAKER_09]: There are so many streets.

2780
03:19:55,134 --> 03:19:58,296
[SPEAKER_09]: You go up to Doonan Street, you go up to Hillside, you go up to Fulton Street.

2781
03:19:59,716 --> 03:20:00,817
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are all over the place.

2782
03:20:00,877 --> 03:20:07,801
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you have to do work, but whoever is filling your potholes or whoever is filling your trenches, you leave a lot to be desired.

2783
03:20:09,533 --> 03:20:11,174
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just me talking on another area.

2784
03:20:11,494 --> 03:20:12,294
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have a motion?

2785
03:20:12,394 --> 03:20:12,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

2786
03:20:12,694 --> 03:20:14,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Move approval with that condition to the city.

2787
03:20:14,274 --> 03:20:37,482
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion for approval, uh, offered by Councilor Penta with the condition says the, uh, engineer department reviewed the site in six months to make sure that it meets the standards of a repair of a public way and further amended that there be a $100,000 bond, uh, placed by national grid on the project for repairs to the area.

2788
03:20:37,502 --> 03:20:37,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2789
03:20:38,803 --> 03:20:43,606
[SPEAKER_09]: No, to the City of Medford, no, to the City of Medford for repairs if they become deficient.

2790
03:20:44,106 --> 03:20:47,968
[SPEAKER_18]: For repairs to the City of Medford should they become deficient.

2791
03:20:49,309 --> 03:20:50,870
[SPEAKER_18]: On that, all those in favor?

2792
03:20:51,130 --> 03:20:51,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

2793
03:20:51,470 --> 03:20:59,275

[SPEAKER_18]: Prescott Street, National Grid, to install one new joint ownership pole, strut guy, and anchor

2799

[SPEAKER_18]: Pole will be labeled 6184-84.

2801
03:21:51,237 --> 03:21:57,121
[SPEAKER_18]: Wherefore it prays that after due notice and hearing, as provided by Laura, be given permission to excavate.

2806
03:22:14,761 --> 03:22:15,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

2807
03:22:16,703 --> 03:22:17,944
[SPEAKER_18]: Anybody in opposition?

2808
03:22:18,684 --> 03:22:24,969
[SPEAKER_18]: Hearing and seeing none, we declare this portion closed and open up the floor to questions.

2809
03:22:25,450 --> 03:22:26,911
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you tell us about this project, sir?

2810
03:22:28,332 --> 03:22:30,774
[SPEAKER_20]: We're petitioning on installing a J-O-P-O.

2811
03:22:32,872 --> 03:22:37,095
[SPEAKER_20]: across the street from Post 6184 at the corner of Carter Street and Prescott Street.

2812
03:22:39,377 --> 03:22:44,321
[SPEAKER_20]: Right now, there's a guy wire from existing Post 6184 to a tree.

2813
03:22:45,662 --> 03:22:51,266
[SPEAKER_20]: It actually, the tree is located between House 9 Prescott Street and 17 Prescott Street.

2814
03:22:51,286 --> 03:22:52,547
[SPEAKER_20]: We would like to remove that guy wire.

2815
03:22:54,762 --> 03:22:57,064
[SPEAKER_20]: and install a stub pole with an anchor.

2816
03:22:58,286 --> 03:22:59,267
[SPEAKER_20]: Excuse me, a double pole?

2817
03:22:59,507 --> 03:23:01,189
[SPEAKER_20]: A single pole across the street.

2818
03:23:01,849 --> 03:23:04,152
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's due to the tension of the wires.

2819
03:23:04,172 --> 03:23:05,473
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't want the pole to fall over.

2820
03:23:07,836 --> 03:23:08,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

2821
03:23:08,496 --> 03:23:09,137
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor?

2822
03:23:10,759 --> 03:23:14,643
[SPEAKER_25]: Does that have to pass practice if there was a tree around to use a tree?

2823
03:23:15,243 --> 03:23:16,525
[SPEAKER_25]: Why would it be connected to a tree?

2824
03:23:18,313 --> 03:23:29,521
[SPEAKER_20]: Because nowadays, the customer, if the tree is on their property, they would like to have it removed or they don't want our equipment on their pole, on the tree, I'm sorry.

2825
03:23:30,222 --> 03:23:36,186
[SPEAKER_20]: And if the tree ends up dying because of the guy wire, we would have to remove it anyways.

2826
03:23:37,046 --> 03:23:39,508
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, but how did it first get installed on a tree?

2827
03:23:41,189 --> 03:23:41,910
[SPEAKER_20]: Started before me.

2828
03:23:43,451 --> 03:23:44,652
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's not the practice to

2829
03:23:45,428 --> 03:23:46,769
[SPEAKER_25]: put a guide wire into a tree?

2830
03:23:46,849 --> 03:23:49,550
[SPEAKER_20]: No, nowadays we don't put guide wires to a tree anymore.

2831
03:23:49,570 --> 03:23:50,691
[SPEAKER_20]: We would like to remove all of them.

2832
03:23:51,291 --> 03:23:52,252
[SPEAKER_25]: So at some point you did?

2833
03:23:52,692 --> 03:23:53,032
[SPEAKER_20]: Excuse me?

2834
03:23:53,352 --> 03:23:55,793
[SPEAKER_25]: At some point you did put guide wires to trees?

2835
03:23:56,894 --> 03:23:57,554
[SPEAKER_20]: Not with my knowledge.

2836
03:23:57,594 --> 03:23:58,075
[SPEAKER_20]: I wouldn't.

2837
03:23:58,135 --> 03:23:58,475
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

2838
03:23:59,715 --> 03:23:59,895
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry.

2839
03:24:00,136 --> 03:24:01,316

2886
03:27:26,985 --> 03:27:28,366
[SPEAKER_25]: The last day you can obtain one?

2887
03:27:28,646 --> 03:27:30,046
[SPEAKER_19]: Obtain one, yeah.

2888
03:27:30,066 --> 03:27:34,008
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be over the counter.

2889
03:27:34,108 --> 03:27:41,410
[SPEAKER_19]: We won't, more than likely, if you were looking to get it mailed to you, you would have to do so.

2890
03:27:41,430 --> 03:27:42,451
[SPEAKER_09]: 12 o'clock, September 1st?

2891
03:27:43,171 --> 03:27:44,251
[SPEAKER_25]: Probably before.

2892
03:27:46,252 --> 03:27:47,892
[SPEAKER_25]: Eddie, did you say- Supposed to get it back.

2893
03:27:47,912 --> 03:27:49,113
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, when's the last day to submit it?

2894
03:27:52,902 --> 03:27:56,724
[SPEAKER_19]: submitting it, well, in the mail, on call.

2895
03:27:57,104 --> 03:27:59,426
[SPEAKER_25]: Up until August 31st?

2896
03:28:00,206 --> 03:28:02,368
[SPEAKER_19]: No, September 1st, the day of the election.

2897
03:28:02,468 --> 03:28:03,549
[SPEAKER_19]: They'd be mailing it.

2898
03:28:04,209 --> 03:28:05,970
[SPEAKER_19]: They'd take everything up to the polls.

2899
03:28:07,551 --> 03:28:10,593
[SPEAKER_25]: But if you mail it on that day, you're not going to get it for that election.

2900
03:28:10,693 --> 03:28:12,394
[SPEAKER_25]: So would he count it the following?

2901
03:28:12,514 --> 03:28:13,255
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I'm kidding.

2902
03:28:13,295 --> 03:28:13,715
[SPEAKER_25]: Postmark.

2903
03:28:16,097 --> 03:28:17,557
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's what I'm trying to figure out.

2904
03:28:17,577 --> 03:28:21,260
[SPEAKER_25]: So when's the last day that someone can submit something to the clerk's office?

2905
03:28:22,955 --> 03:28:27,118
[SPEAKER_25]: So it would be counted.

2906
03:28:27,218 --> 03:28:35,002
[SPEAKER_19]: If they choose to come in and drop it off, we'll take it that day, election day.

2907
03:28:36,343 --> 03:28:43,628
[SPEAKER_19]: But if you mail it, and it's not in by the close of the mailing day.

2908
03:28:44,208 --> 03:28:44,768
[SPEAKER_19]: Of what day?

2909
03:28:44,908 --> 03:28:46,349
[SPEAKER_19]: Post office day, September 1st.

2910
03:28:47,330 --> 03:28:48,691
[SPEAKER_19]: Anything afterwards, we won't take it.

2911
03:28:50,132 --> 03:28:52,133
[SPEAKER_25]: So if it's postmarked September 1st, you'll take it?

2912
03:28:53,011 --> 03:28:53,631
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, before that.

2913
03:28:53,991 --> 03:28:54,151
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

2914
03:28:54,691 --> 03:28:55,171
[SPEAKER_19]: Before that.

2915
03:28:55,231 --> 03:28:56,872
[SPEAKER_19]: No, you can't mail it out September 1st.

2916
03:28:58,812 --> 03:29:01,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Eddie, you just said, I don't know if it was a slip.

2917
03:29:02,473 --> 03:29:04,113
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you made a slip.

2918
03:29:04,133 --> 03:29:08,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you say you can come in up to 12 o'clock on September 1st to get an absentee ballot?

2919
03:29:08,994 --> 03:29:09,154
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

2920
03:29:09,514 --> 03:29:11,975
[SPEAKER_19]: The day before, Monday the day before, September 1st.

2921
03:29:13,315 --> 03:29:13,995
[SPEAKER_19]: August 31st.

2922
03:29:14,555 --> 03:29:14,735
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

2923
03:29:14,755 --> 03:29:15,396
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that August 30th?

2924
03:29:15,436 --> 03:29:16,436
[SPEAKER_19]: August 31st.

2925
03:29:17,556 --> 03:29:17,696
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

2926
03:29:17,816 --> 03:29:20,357
[SPEAKER_19]: Physically, that's physically coming into account.

2927
03:29:21,677 --> 03:29:22,657
[SPEAKER_09]: So what happens to all these

2928
03:29:23,202 --> 03:29:26,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Service people that are overseas, they have to get their ballots when?

2929
03:29:27,005 --> 03:29:27,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Well in advance.

2930
03:29:29,006 --> 03:29:33,229
[SPEAKER_09]: People who are overseas, out of state, they have to get these ballots to you well in advance.

2931
03:29:33,769 --> 03:29:35,490
[SPEAKER_09]: They have to be there before September 1st.

2932
03:29:35,871 --> 03:29:37,512
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we've been mailing it to them.

2933
03:29:37,752 --> 03:29:38,372
[SPEAKER_09]: By 5 o'clock.

2934
03:29:38,793 --> 03:29:40,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, when do you open up those ballots?

2935
03:29:41,975 --> 03:29:42,955
[SPEAKER_19]: Open up those ballots?

2936
03:29:42,995 --> 03:29:44,516
[SPEAKER_09]: The ballots, the absentee ballots.

2937
03:29:44,917 --> 03:29:45,937
[SPEAKER_09]: When do you open them up?

2938
03:29:47,238 --> 03:29:52,702
[SPEAKER_19]: Those ballots are delivered to the actual polls during the day, and then you count it.

2939
03:29:53,040 --> 03:29:57,023
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, but what about the ones that you have to wait till the end of the day when the mail comes in?

2940
03:29:57,063 --> 03:29:58,405
[SPEAKER_09]: When do they count, to the next day?

2941
03:29:59,185 --> 03:30:04,730
[SPEAKER_19]: No, we have them to close a polling to bring the ballots up there.

2942
03:30:05,210 --> 03:30:05,991
[SPEAKER_19]: So we will bring it.

2943
03:30:07,232 --> 03:30:14,018
[SPEAKER_09]: So whatever mail you get on September 1st, that day, election day, you bring to the respective polls?

2944
03:30:14,158 --> 03:30:14,919
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be too late.

2945
03:30:15,499 --> 03:30:16,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then how does it work?

2946
03:30:19,165 --> 03:30:23,426
[SPEAKER_09]: If you get the mail later in the day, how do you get it to the polls by 8 o'clock for them to count it?

2947
03:30:25,247 --> 03:30:27,107
[SPEAKER_19]: We physically run it out there to the polls.

2948
03:30:27,627 --> 03:30:28,328
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I just said.

2949
03:30:28,768 --> 03:30:30,908
[SPEAKER_19]: But you said mailing it afterwards.

2950
03:30:30,968 --> 03:30:32,869
[SPEAKER_19]: If the mail comes in on September 1, I'm not going to get it.

2951
03:30:32,929 --> 03:30:35,109
[SPEAKER_09]: You have the mail up to September 1 on that day.

2952
03:30:35,549 --> 03:30:43,511
[SPEAKER_18]: So if the postman comes into City Hall and drops off a bundle of mail at 435, they sort it out, and they send it out to where it's got to go to be counted.

2953
03:30:43,771 --> 03:30:44,351
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it.

2954
03:30:44,531 --> 03:30:46,772
[SPEAKER_19]: We actually go to the polls.

2955
03:30:47,623 --> 03:30:52,744
[SPEAKER_19]: post office at the close of day and collect anything that's outside.

2956
03:30:52,825 --> 03:30:54,345
[SPEAKER_09]: So nothing's counted the next day.

2957
03:30:54,405 --> 03:30:55,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything is counted that night.

2958
03:30:55,945 --> 03:30:56,826
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

2959
03:30:58,966 --> 03:30:59,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Overseas ballot.

2960
03:30:59,646 --> 03:30:59,947
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2961
03:30:59,967 --> 03:31:00,367
[SPEAKER_09]: That's another.

2962
03:31:00,427 --> 03:31:04,068
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't have any overseas ballots.

2963
03:31:05,588 --> 03:31:06,008
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2964
03:31:06,789 --> 03:31:10,230
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight, 15-612 offered by Councilor Knight.

2965
03:31:10,250 --> 03:31:15,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, if I may, um, I spoke with the sponsors of, uh, papers,

2966
03:31:16,141 --> 03:31:23,528
[SPEAKER_13]: 15609, 15611, 15621, and we've agreed to merge these papers together because they're all of similar substance and material.

2967
03:31:24,910 --> 03:31:25,811
[SPEAKER_14]: What papers are these?

2968
03:31:26,572 --> 03:31:27,733
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that the one you just went through here?

2969
03:31:29,435 --> 03:31:31,437
[SPEAKER_13]: The next three, the next in regular order of business?

2970
03:31:31,457 --> 03:31:31,717
[SPEAKER_13]: 609, 611, and 621?

2971
03:31:35,221 --> 03:31:36,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Council?

2972
03:31:36,902 --> 03:31:37,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion's passed.

2973
03:31:37,942 --> 03:31:39,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Am I at the right place?

2974
03:31:39,282 --> 03:31:39,382
[SPEAKER_13]: 609, 611 and 621?

2975
03:31:39,803 --> 03:31:41,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they're all of similar substance and material.

2976
03:31:41,963 --> 03:31:44,124
[SPEAKER_13]: I spoke with the sponsors of the bills and they've agreed to merge.

2977
03:31:44,164 --> 03:31:47,405
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll read them separately and then we'll address them together.

2978
03:31:47,425 --> 03:31:50,786
[SPEAKER_18]: 15-609 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

2979
03:31:51,286 --> 03:31:58,229
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss the paving that was recently done on Withrop Circle.

2980
03:31:58,249 --> 03:31:59,729
[SPEAKER_18]: 15-611 offered by Councilor Knight.

2981
03:32:00,229 --> 03:32:02,230
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it resolved that the crosswalk and

2982
03:32:02,902 --> 03:32:12,128
[SPEAKER_18]: On the east side of Winthrop Street Rotary at High Street, have the crosswalk repainted as well as the handicapped parking places in front of 190 High Street.

2983
03:32:12,148 --> 03:32:21,754
[SPEAKER_18]: 15621 offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the Traffic Commission post yield signs at the Winthrop Street Rotary on the approaching roads.

2984
03:32:21,894 --> 03:32:29,339
[SPEAKER_18]: Furthermore, that the sign be placed inside the circle facing Route 38 North that says, a rotary.

2985
03:32:30,118 --> 03:32:32,339
[SPEAKER_18]: Who is going to speak on this first, councilman?

2986
03:32:32,539 --> 03:32:36,140
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to defer to Councilor Caraviello as this paper was put on the agenda.

2987
03:32:36,400 --> 03:32:37,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello.

2988
03:32:37,841 --> 03:32:38,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2989
03:32:38,581 --> 03:32:43,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I live over that area and I drive around Winthrop Circle multiple times a day.

2990
03:32:44,303 --> 03:32:58,989
[SPEAKER_05]: It behooves me to understand why the company who did the paving there went around and deliberately went around patches of roadway when they could have ground the whole thing down and made it one neat piece.

2991
03:33:00,407 --> 03:33:06,390
[SPEAKER_05]: We now have a patchwork circle of crappy paving, Mr. President.

2992
03:33:06,410 --> 03:33:14,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was their trucks that went around that circle for the last two and a half years, grinded it down.

2993
03:33:14,093 --> 03:33:17,715
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we were working it, I don't understand why they couldn't have paved the whole circle.

2994
03:33:18,035 --> 03:33:23,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Rather than leaving a square here, and a little section here, and another little section.

2995
03:33:24,157 --> 03:33:27,759
[SPEAKER_05]: It just behooves me to understand why that happened.

2996
03:33:28,972 --> 03:33:33,994
[SPEAKER_05]: how we allowed it, how our either engineer or whoever saw that allowed that to happen.

2997
03:33:38,436 --> 03:33:38,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2998
03:33:39,056 --> 03:33:42,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we have a report on how and why that happened and why the company did it like that?

2999
03:33:43,438 --> 03:33:55,003
[SPEAKER_18]: Moved by Councilor Caraviello that the city engineer report back to the city council regarding the insufficiencies with the repaving at Withrop Circle.

3000
03:33:55,684 --> 03:33:56,364
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks.

3001
03:33:58,256 --> 03:33:59,216
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3002
03:33:59,256 --> 03:34:11,459
[SPEAKER_25]: My resolve is regarding Winthrop Circle and to clarify some of the confusion that's out there regarding the entering of the circle itself.

3003
03:34:12,079 --> 03:34:25,302
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would just ask that yield signs be posted at Winthrop Street Rotary on the approaching roads and that a sign be placed inside the circle facing Route 38 North that says Rotary.

3004
03:34:26,393 --> 03:34:33,715
[SPEAKER_25]: So people that are coming up realize it's a rotary, and that may help with some of the confusion, Mr. President.

3005
03:34:34,135 --> 03:34:48,199
[SPEAKER_18]: So that offered by Councilman Marks that in the interest of public safety, in good order, that the aforementioned remedies be forwarded to the Traffic Commission for immediate action.

3006
03:34:48,639 --> 03:34:49,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilman Knight.

3007
03:34:49,960 --> 03:34:51,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

3008
03:34:51,280 --> 03:34:53,801
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been brought to my attention, and it's my understanding that

3009
03:34:54,757 --> 03:35:05,524
[SPEAKER_13]: The gas company did some construction work, and in the process of doing this construction work, they have ground up and repaved over the preexisting crosswalk at the corner of Winthrop and Morell.

3010
03:35:06,464 --> 03:35:10,607
[SPEAKER_13]: And that crosswalk has not been repainted, and it needs to be, Mr. President.

3011
03:35:11,147 --> 03:35:12,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Recently, we had a death.

3012
03:35:13,248 --> 03:35:21,293
[SPEAKER_13]: A resident of 190 High Street crossing the street was struck as a pedestrian crossing, and she died as a result of the injuries that she sustained in that.

3013
03:35:21,912 --> 03:35:33,084
[SPEAKER_13]: accident, Mr. President, so I think it's very important that we have a crosswalk in the vicinity of the corner, and I think that Councilor Mark's resolution to include yield signs there makes perfect sense.

3014
03:35:33,845 --> 03:35:40,833
[SPEAKER_13]: There are also a couple of handicapped spots, Mr. President, that are out in front of the building number 190 High Street that have fallen into disrepair.

3015
03:35:41,906 --> 03:35:46,029
[SPEAKER_13]: Mainly because of the amount of debris that's been on the road as a result of the construction projects that have been going on.

3016
03:35:46,109 --> 03:35:48,830
[SPEAKER_13]: The paint for the handicapped spots is worn completely away.

3017
03:35:49,511 --> 03:35:52,933
[SPEAKER_13]: There's been an outcry from the residents in the building that are asking that this be taken care of.

3018
03:35:53,513 --> 03:35:58,236
[SPEAKER_13]: I've had some preliminary conversations with the DPW and I'm very confident that it will be addressed.

3019
03:35:58,896 --> 03:36:03,719
[SPEAKER_13]: However, where the work still needs to be done, I figured it would be appropriate to continue further with the resolution.

3020
03:36:04,299 --> 03:36:07,001
[SPEAKER_13]: As such, I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this matter.

3021
03:36:07,820 --> 03:36:15,365
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of Council tonight, that this matter be presented to the DPW and the Traffic Commission for immediate action.

3022
03:36:16,125 --> 03:36:16,905
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

3023
03:36:16,925 --> 03:36:17,426
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

3024
03:36:17,626 --> 03:36:18,346
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

3025
03:36:18,366 --> 03:36:22,028
[SPEAKER_18]: The combined motion passes.

3026
03:36:22,048 --> 03:36:23,349
[SPEAKER_18]: 15-622, offered by Councilor Marks.

3027
03:36:23,950 --> 03:36:27,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it resolved that the matter, oh, what did I skip?

3028
03:36:28,092 --> 03:36:28,372
[SPEAKER_18]: No blue.

3029
03:36:30,196 --> 03:36:31,877
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought we were in the business.

3030
03:36:31,897 --> 03:36:37,178
[SPEAKER_13]: We did these, right?

3031
03:36:37,198 --> 03:36:38,779
[SPEAKER_21]: Page six.

3032
03:36:39,439 --> 03:36:41,379
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have that.

3033
03:36:41,840 --> 03:36:48,722
[SPEAKER_05]: The order's a little messed up, Mr. President.

3034
03:36:49,142 --> 03:36:49,962
[SPEAKER_25]: You see a 10 on that?

3035
03:36:49,982 --> 03:36:50,422
[SPEAKER_25]: Where is it?

3036
03:36:50,442 --> 03:36:50,822
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, okay.

3037
03:36:50,842 --> 03:36:53,043
[SPEAKER_25]: I have 22 by Marks and then 10 by Penta.

3038
03:37:00,415 --> 03:37:06,197
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we gave you a revised agenda because of all the different things that came in.

3039
03:37:07,937 --> 03:37:08,777
[SPEAKER_18]: Ah, look at this.

3040
03:37:08,797 --> 03:37:25,602
[SPEAKER_18]: 15-610 offered by Council Penta be resolved that the huge amount of questionable dirt that has to be repeatedly covered with plastic in front of the triple business development along Riverside Avenue at Wellington Fellsway Plaza

3041
03:37:26,201 --> 03:37:27,721
[SPEAKER_18]: be discussed, Councilor Penta.

3042
03:37:28,041 --> 03:37:31,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we have Panera, Snappy Patty, not Snappy Patties.

3043
03:37:31,182 --> 03:37:31,462
[SPEAKER_09]: What is it?

3044
03:37:32,522 --> 03:37:33,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Smashburgers.

3045
03:37:33,443 --> 03:37:40,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Smashburgers and noodles and noodles going down over there.

3046
03:37:41,184 --> 03:37:45,765
[SPEAKER_09]: This is really a disgrace what's going on because it's alleged that it's contaminated soil.

3047
03:37:46,065 --> 03:37:49,646
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been covered up and re-covered up, you know, on hot, warm days.

3048
03:37:49,906 --> 03:37:52,507
[SPEAKER_09]: And when the wind blows, that dirt is going all over the place.

3049
03:37:52,887 --> 03:37:54,007
[SPEAKER_09]: There's got to be a reason why.

3050
03:37:55,008 --> 03:37:57,570
[SPEAKER_09]: or a problem why that dirt has not been removed.

3051
03:37:57,650 --> 03:38:05,074
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, how do you have a triple business development take place over there and have this amount of dirt stay there day in and day out, month in and month out?

3052
03:38:05,834 --> 03:38:19,662
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Mr. President, I'm going to move that the building department and our health inspector go down there, tag them, find them, do whatever it takes, because this is absolutely unacceptable as part of a business project development here in this community.

3053
03:38:20,063 --> 03:38:24,185
[SPEAKER_09]: And if the city was on top of this, we wouldn't even be discussing this, but it's quite obvious.

3054
03:38:24,602 --> 03:38:25,622
[SPEAKER_09]: that there is something wrong there.

3055
03:38:25,662 --> 03:38:29,924
[SPEAKER_09]: They just, once again this past week, covered it with more new type of clear plastic.

3056
03:38:30,604 --> 03:38:32,465
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know, I can't answer it.

3057
03:38:32,485 --> 03:38:36,527
[SPEAKER_09]: The poor people across the street, the lady who's across the street, she's beside herself.

3058
03:38:36,587 --> 03:38:38,587
[SPEAKER_09]: She just can't understand what's going on over there.

3059
03:38:39,668 --> 03:38:42,929
[SPEAKER_09]: And so is it the responsibility of the three people?

3060
03:38:42,989 --> 03:38:45,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it the responsibility of the people that own the parking lot?

3061
03:38:45,270 --> 03:38:45,650
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

3062
03:38:46,190 --> 03:38:46,730
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's there.

3063
03:38:46,750 --> 03:38:50,412
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's the first time in all my years serving that this amount of dirt

3064
03:38:51,251 --> 03:38:57,395
[SPEAKER_09]: has hung around after projects gotten started, while the project continues to go forward, and the dirt continues to stay there.

3065
03:38:58,016 --> 03:39:01,098
[SPEAKER_09]: So Mr. President, I ask that we move on this expeditiously.

3066
03:39:01,598 --> 03:39:04,841
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we don't meet until the end of September, so I don't want to wait till then.

3067
03:39:04,901 --> 03:39:08,583
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this needs to be resolved immediately, and the fines need to be assessed.

3068
03:39:08,603 --> 03:39:09,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead and do it.

3069
03:39:09,584 --> 03:39:10,685
[SPEAKER_09]: The city should go ahead and do it.

3070
03:39:10,725 --> 03:39:13,207
[SPEAKER_09]: But the fact of the matter is, it doesn't belong there.

3071
03:39:13,507 --> 03:39:14,988
[SPEAKER_09]: So I move the question and roll call vote.

3072
03:39:15,008 --> 03:39:19,992
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Kenta, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3073
03:39:20,827 --> 03:39:23,429
[SPEAKER_09]: the Board of Health and the Court of Enforcement, and the Billing Department.

3074
03:39:23,549 --> 03:39:26,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I said that, the Board of Health.

3075
03:39:26,411 --> 03:39:27,932
[SPEAKER_18]: The Board of Health and Court Enforcement.

3076
03:39:30,014 --> 03:39:30,774
[SPEAKER_18]: And National Grid.

3077
03:39:37,439 --> 03:39:39,060
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Camuso?

3078
03:39:39,080 --> 03:39:40,001
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

3079
03:39:42,643 --> 03:39:43,484
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Caravielloles?

3080
03:39:43,524 --> 03:39:43,664
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

3081
03:39:44,324 --> 03:39:44,865
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight?

3082
03:39:44,945 --> 03:39:45,285
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

3083
03:39:45,705 --> 03:39:46,686
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn?

3084
03:39:46,726 --> 03:39:47,166
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

3085
03:39:47,326 --> 03:39:47,887
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks?

3086
03:39:48,227 --> 03:39:48,347
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

3087
03:39:48,547 --> 03:39:49,148
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Penta?

3088
03:39:49,168 --> 03:39:49,428
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

3089
03:39:49,888 --> 03:39:50,609
[SPEAKER_19]: President De La Russa?

3090
03:39:51,258 --> 03:39:51,538
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

3091
03:39:51,999 --> 03:40:16,480
[SPEAKER_18]: With a vote of six in the affirmative or one absent motion passes 15-six 22 offered by council mocks be resolved that the Medford city council hold a public hearing on Tuesday, October 6th at 7 PM and invite ever source and the appropriate city departments to discuss the proposed underground utility work slated for 2017 be it further resolved that the city send out a reverse 911 call

3092
03:40:17,662 --> 03:40:21,205
[SPEAKER_18]: to all Medford residents, notifying them of the public hearing.

3093
03:40:21,265 --> 03:40:21,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Moniz.

3094
03:40:22,646 --> 03:40:23,727
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3095
03:40:24,147 --> 03:40:33,735
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sure many other councils received the same phone calls and emails regarding a meeting that was held here at City Hall several weeks back by Eversource.

3096
03:40:35,316 --> 03:40:45,945
[SPEAKER_25]: It was a combined meeting of Somerville, Winchester, and Medford because this particular two and a half mile stretch of an underground utility

3097
03:40:46,362 --> 03:41:15,943
[SPEAKER_25]: impacts several communities, and residents that attended from the city of Medford were quite disappointed to see that Somerville had representation from the city administration, Winchester had someone from their town hall, and the city of Medford did not have one person from the administration representing the community and the residents regarding this major problem project.

3098
03:41:16,731 --> 03:41:27,637
[SPEAKER_25]: that's going to cut through Winthrop Street and down South Street, down Mystic Ave, through the heart of our community and disrupt the roadways.

3099
03:41:28,298 --> 03:41:36,142
[SPEAKER_25]: In particular, as we all know, Winthrop Circle that's been under repair for the last two and a half years, they're going to re-dig this road up.

3100
03:41:36,903 --> 03:41:39,965
[SPEAKER_25]: And there are still a lot of outstanding questions.

3101
03:41:40,585 --> 03:41:44,187
[SPEAKER_25]: This council put a resolution on several weeks back

3102
03:41:44,738 --> 03:41:51,920
[SPEAKER_25]: And many of us asked representatives from Eversource a number of questions, of which we have yet to receive any responses.

3103
03:41:52,460 --> 03:42:02,483
[SPEAKER_25]: So I had asked through this resolution that we have a full-blown public hearing on Tuesday, October 6th.

3104
03:42:02,583 --> 03:42:05,043
[SPEAKER_25]: That gives Eversource time to prepare.

3105
03:42:05,484 --> 03:42:12,946
[SPEAKER_25]: It gives the city time to send out a reverse 911 call to residents that are impacted by this project.

3106
03:42:12,966 --> 03:42:14,246
[SPEAKER_25]: And it not only impacts

3107
03:42:14,672 --> 03:42:20,194
[SPEAKER_25]: residents along the roadway, but it's going to impact traffic for every resident in our community.

3108
03:42:21,014 --> 03:42:28,937
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think we have to start talking about mitigation, which I haven't heard anything in regards to that as of yet.

3109
03:42:29,717 --> 03:42:44,162
[SPEAKER_25]: And what's going to be done regarding the traffic and how it's going to impact the Craddock Bridge project, because we all know it's coming down South Street, and that's just a stone's throw from the Craddock Bridge.

3110
03:42:44,861 --> 03:42:53,727
[SPEAKER_25]: at the very tip, and I would ask that this be supported by the council and sent to the mayor for action, Madam President.

3111
03:42:54,568 --> 03:42:55,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

3112
03:42:56,009 --> 03:42:57,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval by Councilor Marks.

3113
03:42:57,750 --> 03:42:58,470
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

3114
03:42:58,530 --> 03:42:59,571
[SPEAKER_25]: Roll call vote, Madam President.

3115
03:42:59,591 --> 03:43:00,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call has been requested.

3116
03:43:00,672 --> 03:43:10,438
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Camuso.

3117
03:43:10,498 --> 03:43:10,558
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

3118
03:43:13,587 --> 03:43:14,367
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Caraviello?

3119
03:43:14,467 --> 03:43:14,687
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

3120
03:43:14,707 --> 03:43:16,088
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight?

3121
03:43:16,228 --> 03:43:16,628
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

3122
03:43:17,389 --> 03:43:18,509
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice-President Alan Kern?

3123
03:43:19,169 --> 03:43:19,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

3124
03:43:24,792 --> 03:43:25,372
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marksley?

3125
03:43:25,412 --> 03:43:25,772
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

3126
03:43:25,852 --> 03:43:27,413
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Penta?

3127
03:43:27,433 --> 03:43:27,533
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

3128
03:43:27,553 --> 03:43:30,274
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Hussle?

3129
03:43:30,474 --> 03:43:32,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

3130
03:43:32,435 --> 03:43:33,335
[SPEAKER_10]: The paper passes.

3131
03:43:35,036 --> 03:43:43,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulates Firefighter John Friedman on his recent appointment

3132
03:43:43,587 --> 03:43:44,988
[SPEAKER_10]: to the rank of deputy chief.

3133

[SPEAKER_10]: Faye Faye to William Young on his recent appointment to the rank of captain.

[SPEAKER_10]: Faye Faye to Vincent Marcelino on his recent appointment to the rank of lieutenant.

3135
03:43:54,157 --> 03:43:57,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Faye Faye to Stephen Oliveri on his recent appointment to the rank of lieutenant.

3136
03:43:58,061 --> 03:43:58,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

3137
03:43:59,763 --> 03:44:01,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam President, thank you very much.

3138
03:44:01,925 --> 03:44:04,247
[SPEAKER_13]: These four individuals have long served our community.

3139
03:44:05,007 --> 03:44:05,867
[SPEAKER_13]: is firefighters.

3140
03:44:06,327 --> 03:44:07,988
[SPEAKER_13]: They've done their best to keep us safe.

3141
03:44:08,028 --> 03:44:09,448
[SPEAKER_13]: They've done their best to protect us.

3142
03:44:09,668 --> 03:44:15,550
[SPEAKER_13]: And because of their hard work, dedication, and commitment, they've been elevated to new positions.

3143
03:44:15,950 --> 03:44:20,991
[SPEAKER_13]: These four individuals have between them over 100 years of service to the Medford Fire Department.

3144
03:44:21,271 --> 03:44:25,892
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's with great honor and privilege that I welcome them aboard in their new role and wish them the best of luck.

3145
03:44:26,012 --> 03:44:28,313
[SPEAKER_13]: I would hope that my council colleagues join me in doing the same.

3146
03:44:29,038 --> 03:44:29,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

3147
03:44:29,698 --> 03:44:31,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

3148
03:44:31,699 --> 03:44:32,479

03:44:32,819 --> 03:44:33,880
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

03:44:34,220 --> 03:44:34,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Paper passes.

[SPEAKER_10]: We wish them good luck.

3152

[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved the Medford City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Charles Barry on his recent passing.

[SPEAKER_10]: David was a veteran of the Korean War.

3157
03:45:21,439 --> 03:45:23,219
[SPEAKER_10]: He will be missed by his family and friends.

3158
03:45:24,819 --> 03:45:26,860
[SPEAKER_10]: If we could all please rise for a moment of silence.

3159
03:45:44,560 --> 03:45:57,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by 15615, offered by Councilor Camuso, be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its congratulations to former Medford First Lady Joyce Pompeo on her first flight.

3161
03:46:02,969 --> 03:46:03,770

3162
03:46:05,551 --> 03:46:07,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval by Councilor Camuso.

3163
03:46:07,692 --> 03:46:08,412
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

3164
03:46:08,432 --> 03:46:09,252
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

3165
03:46:09,332 --> 03:46:10,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Papers, passes.

3166
03:46:12,774 --> 03:46:13,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that it?

3167
03:46:17,729 --> 03:46:25,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, 15-623, offered by Councilor Penta, be it resolved that the putting of parking kiosks in our municipal lots be discussed.

3168
03:46:25,352 --> 03:46:26,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Penta.

3169
03:46:28,394 --> 03:46:29,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we already do that?

3170
03:46:29,094 --> 03:46:38,019
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we had talked about it, but I just want to make it as part of the official resolution that these kiosks that are now going in there, the proper signage has yet to be put into the parking lots.

3171
03:46:39,519 --> 03:46:40,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know how they can do this.

3172
03:46:41,080 --> 03:46:44,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again, people are just being taxed

3173
03:46:45,208 --> 03:46:49,713
[SPEAKER_09]: impositioned by these kiosks from these out-of-state bounty hunters.

3174
03:46:49,813 --> 03:46:55,458
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's just no sympathy being left out there for people who don't understand the program.

3175
03:46:55,879 --> 03:46:59,082
[SPEAKER_09]: At the same time, all they want to do is just keep taxing the people.

3176
03:46:59,182 --> 03:47:01,204
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is not the way our city should be going.

3177
03:47:01,224 --> 03:47:03,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, like I said, it's not good for business.

3178
03:47:04,047 --> 03:47:07,230
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know how you can set up these programs, especially when

3179
03:47:07,697 --> 03:47:15,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Parking is supposed to be three hours in the municipal lots, and these kiosks are now going to be regulated to a maximum of two over 15-minute increments.

3180
03:47:15,963 --> 03:47:17,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Signage isn't properly put up.

3181
03:47:17,645 --> 03:47:34,097
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to refer this, Mr. President, Madam President, to our parking commission and Republic Park, and also ask, as a tag-on to this, that they entertain Saturday operating hours at Park Medford on Main Street and Medford.

3182
03:47:35,898 --> 03:47:36,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Just repeat that one more time.

3183
03:47:37,199 --> 03:47:52,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I want, as a tag along to this resolution, relative toward the unacceptable use of these kiosks in the parking lots, to request also that they entertain staying open on Saturdays as a regular business working day.

3184
03:47:53,291 --> 03:47:54,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Park Medford.

3185
03:47:54,392 --> 03:47:57,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Park Medford opens on Saturdays as a regular business day.

3186
03:47:57,774 --> 03:47:58,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

3187
03:47:58,134 --> 03:47:59,535
[SPEAKER_10]: The office on Main Street.

3188
03:48:01,877 --> 03:48:02,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote, Mr. President.

3189
03:48:05,058 --> 03:48:06,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval.

3190
03:48:06,559 --> 03:48:07,380
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

3191
03:48:07,400 --> 03:48:08,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call.

3192
03:48:08,381 --> 03:48:09,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll calls are requested.

3193
03:48:10,042 --> 03:48:18,909
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, from the chair, you also want parking meters in which municipal lots?

3194
03:48:19,389 --> 03:48:19,549
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

3195
03:48:19,949 --> 03:48:28,276
[SPEAKER_09]: The parking meters in the municipal lots are not ready to go, because the signage is not ready, which is supposed to be for three-hour parking lots.

3196
03:48:28,676 --> 03:48:31,899
[SPEAKER_09]: And as a result of that, I want that referred to the traffic commission.

3197
03:48:31,919 --> 03:48:32,359
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, referred.

3198
03:48:32,539 --> 03:48:33,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Traffic commission.

3199
03:48:33,500 --> 03:48:33,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

3200
03:48:34,225 --> 03:48:37,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval, roll call vote has been requested by Councilor Penta.

3201
03:48:43,887 --> 03:48:44,687
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Camuso?

3202
03:48:44,707 --> 03:48:46,207
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

3203
03:48:46,247 --> 03:48:46,947
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Caraviello?

3204
03:48:47,027 --> 03:48:47,487
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

3205
03:48:47,787 --> 03:48:48,348
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight?

3206
03:48:48,488 --> 03:48:48,768
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

3207
03:48:49,328 --> 03:48:50,008
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Long?

3208
03:48:50,728 --> 03:48:51,168
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

3209
03:48:52,508 --> 03:48:53,168
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks?

3210
03:48:53,448 --> 03:48:53,929
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

3211
03:48:55,269 --> 03:48:55,869
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Penta?

3212
03:48:55,949 --> 03:48:56,249
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

3213
03:48:56,269 --> 03:48:58,309
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President De La Rosa?

3214
03:48:58,509 --> 03:48:58,989
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

3215
03:48:59,090 --> 03:49:01,770
[SPEAKER_18]: With a vote of 70 affirmative, none of the negative, the motion

3216
03:49:05,238 --> 03:49:18,624
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the administration and the DCR review the current logistics and provide a cost estimate to develop a pedestrian and cycling path linking the Campbell Peace Garden to Riverbend Park.

3217
03:49:18,944 --> 03:49:19,704
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight.

3218
03:49:20,244 --> 03:49:21,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

3219
03:49:22,025 --> 03:49:30,288
[SPEAKER_13]: I've had a lot of talks and a lot of discussion with some residents in the area who are avid cyclists and avid pedestrians, avid walkers, and one of the things that they had

3220
03:49:30,958 --> 03:49:36,331
[SPEAKER_13]: expressed interest in would be connecting the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden by way of the waterfront to Riverbend Park.

3221
03:49:37,422 --> 03:49:38,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds like a good idea to me.

3222
03:49:38,582 --> 03:49:48,125
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to amend the resolution to request that the department of transportation also be involved because my research would indicate that they're also going to be a party to this if in fact it does come to fruition, Mr. President.

3223
03:49:49,025 --> 03:49:55,966
[SPEAKER_13]: However, I feel as though linking Riverbend Park to the Campbell Peace Garden will also give people another reason to come to Medford Square.

3224
03:49:55,986 --> 03:50:06,769
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we can build upon a vision for the square with a bike and pedestrian path, maybe bring Hubway into the square, further expand a bike and pedestrian path from the Campbell Peace Garden along

3225
03:50:07,176 --> 03:50:12,880
[SPEAKER_13]: the Mystic River across Route 16 through Sleepy Hollow, and ultimately connected to the Minuteman Trail in Arlington.

3226
03:50:12,960 --> 03:50:17,504
[SPEAKER_13]: Should we use a little bit of planning, foresight, and vision, I think we can accomplish this, Mr. President.

3227
03:50:17,524 --> 03:50:27,791
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd ask that my council colleagues support this resolution to take the small step in connecting the Campbell Peace Garden and Medford Square to Riverbend Park, and then we can take a look at the bigger picture at a later date.

3228
03:50:28,251 --> 03:50:28,632
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

3229
03:50:28,692 --> 03:50:32,975
[SPEAKER_18]: So as amended by Councilor Knight, and motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

3230
03:50:33,015 --> 03:50:33,815
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

3231
03:50:34,336 --> 03:50:35,116
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

3232
03:50:35,136 --> 03:50:35,337
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion?

3233
03:50:36,946 --> 03:50:39,948
[SPEAKER_18]: The tabled records of June 30th, did we cover everything?

3234
03:50:40,428 --> 03:50:44,550
[SPEAKER_18]: Tabled records of June 30th, 2015 were passed to Councilor Marks.

3235
03:50:44,931 --> 03:50:49,533
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor, how indeed did you find those records?

3236
03:50:49,553 --> 03:50:50,714
[SPEAKER_18]: To be in order, move approval.

3237
03:50:50,994 --> 03:50:53,315
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Marks, all those in favor?

3238
03:50:53,656 --> 03:50:53,876
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

3239
03:50:53,956 --> 03:50:55,397
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

3240
03:50:55,457 --> 03:50:56,277
[SPEAKER_18]: Records are approved.

3241
03:50:56,297 --> 03:51:01,520
[SPEAKER_18]: The records of the July 21st, 2015 meeting were passed to Councilor Panto.

3242
03:51:01,820 --> 03:51:03,501
[SPEAKER_17]: Dear Councilor, how did you find those records?

3243
03:51:06,185 --> 03:51:11,327
[SPEAKER_18]: Council has yet to review them, so on the motion of Council, I'm tempted that they be laid on the table.

3244
03:51:11,927 --> 03:51:12,788
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

3245
03:51:12,808 --> 03:51:14,208
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

3246
03:51:14,589 --> 03:51:15,609
[SPEAKER_18]: Those records are tabled.

3247
03:51:16,409 --> 03:51:18,010
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to adjourn by Council.

3248
03:51:18,850 --> 03:51:19,671
[SPEAKER_18]: Announce the next meeting.

3249
03:51:20,691 --> 03:51:24,533
[SPEAKER_18]: And the next meeting is September 22nd.

3250
03:51:25,173 --> 03:51:25,993
[SPEAKER_18]: September 22nd.

3251
03:51:26,033 --> 03:51:28,894
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a Tuesday at 7 p.m.

3252
03:51:29,715 --> 03:51:31,555
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to adjourn by Council.

3253
03:51:31,736 --> 03:51:32,396
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

3254
03:51:32,416 --> 03:51:33,076
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

3255
03:51:33,676 --> 03:51:34,837
[SPEAKER_17]: Happy rest of August.
