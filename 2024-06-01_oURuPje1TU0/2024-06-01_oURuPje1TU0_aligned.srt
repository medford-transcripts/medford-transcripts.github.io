1
00:00:04,811 --> 00:00:07,692
Order, it's February 14th, 2024.

2
00:00:08,513 --> 00:00:11,335
Mr. Clerk, will you please call the roll?

3
00:00:12,175 --> 00:00:12,775
President Ferris.

4
00:00:13,276 --> 00:00:13,716
Present.

5
00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:14,937
Vice President Collins.

6
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:16,638
Present.

7
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:18,939
Councilor Lazaro.

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,280
Present.

9
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:25,819
Councilor Scarpelli said he may be able to join this meeting a little late.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,186
I know he has work to do as well at his other job.

11
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:33,231
Chair Seng.

12
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:33,872
Present.

13
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:36,834
For present, one absent.

14
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:39,917
The meeting is called to order.

15
00:00:41,538 --> 00:00:46,162
This meeting, we have one action item on the agenda.

16
00:00:46,802 --> 00:00:50,906
This is paper 24-06 offered by President Behrs.

17
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:55,289
It's a resolution that each council committee review the 2024 to 2025 council governing agenda as amended at the January 24th.

18
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,754
committee the whole meeting.

19
00:01:03,155 --> 00:01:11,662
Opening up comments to any councillors who want to speak about the governing agenda.

20
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:12,242
President Behrs.

21
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:14,284
Thank you, Chair Seng.

22
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:26,233
Yeah, just looking at this governing agenda, I think we're blessed in this governance committee to not have one of the super long ones like planning and permitting and even

23
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:30,736
public health and resident services last night, I know, had a lot on there.

24
00:01:31,377 --> 00:01:53,075
Really, what is in the governing agenda here is what they, what this committee is responsible for, just go over it again, ordinances, rules, city charter, elections, departments, the city clerk law, law department, elections commission, boards and commissions, variety of relevant city ordinances, I think the ones that are really

25
00:01:53,975 --> 00:02:07,642
important to factor in here are Appendix B, the rules of the city council, Appendix C, or special acts that affect the city of Medford, and then Appendix D, which are special acts accepted by the city of Medford.

26
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:11,664
So those are provisions of state law that affect the city.

27
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:16,226
Major project updates to the city charter, estimated length and timing of project 12 to 18 months.

28
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:27,790
I mean, for me, for 4 years, and even before that, I have been pushing for us to have an updated city charter and we really need 1.

29
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,917
I think we all at this point, mostly the city agree that we should have a new city charter.

30
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:42,506
This council has proposed home rule petitions to create an elected charter commission, which were not successful.

31
00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:49,752
We proposed 6 to 1 last year, some targeted charter amendments, which were not advanced to the state house by the mayor, which would have helped out around the budget.

32
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:54,637
and appointments and support for the city council.

33
00:02:55,698 --> 00:02:57,860
So we have really put in a ton of work on that.

34
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:06,349
The mayor also appointed a charter study committee on her own, which has been looking at charter ideas and

35
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:19,221
You know they are supposed to provide a report at some point and then we can start the formal process technically charter amendments have to start with the city council so we can take a look at the research that they've come up with.

36
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:26,908
And we can draft a new city charter, which I'm really excited to do, then we can send that to the mayor.

37
00:03:27,428 --> 00:03:32,173
With her approval, she can send it to the state House and state Senate and the governor for their approval.

38
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:41,362
And then hopefully we can have a new charter in effect within the next 2, 3 or 4 years, depending on how that time timeline goes.

39
00:03:41,482 --> 00:03:44,946
So that would be, I think, really exciting for this community.

40
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:48,069
I am super excited to get to work on it.

41
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:49,430
Have a lot of great ideas.

42
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:58,096
hopefully would like to see some of the changes that this council has already supported nearly unanimously be incorporated into any new charter as well.

43
00:03:58,957 --> 00:04:01,578
So I'm really looking forward to that work in this committee.

44
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:07,262
I know we have it on here starting probably sometime in June.

45
00:04:07,662 --> 00:04:09,763
If we could start even earlier, I think that would be great.

46
00:04:10,223 --> 00:04:18,869
I think there are a lot of conversations that we could have even in advance of any final report by the Charter Study Committee to really just get going since we only have

47
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:29,245
23 months left in the term 22 almost, or almost 2 months to end and this project is supposed to be a year, year and a half.

48
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:29,465
So.

49
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:32,808
there's a lot there.

50
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:36,089
I think the only other thing in here is oversight and engagement items.

51
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:40,390
One is the elections department and two is the relevant city ordinances and regulations.

52
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:48,652
We did receive a presentation on January 23rd from the elections manager and elections commission about issues with the November 2023 election.

53
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:51,512
There are also issues with the November 2022 election.

54
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:53,933
I think pretty unanimously the council was

55
00:04:55,034 --> 00:04:57,935
wanted more out of that report and those questions.

56
00:04:58,155 --> 00:05:02,736
We did receive more from the Elections Commission chair, Henry Malorin, so that was good.

57
00:05:04,176 --> 00:05:06,436
But since then, also, the election manager has resigned.

58
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:08,737
So that is not good.

59
00:05:09,617 --> 00:05:12,638
There is a lot more.

60
00:05:13,378 --> 00:05:20,479
At this time, I think that's just a very major change, given that we're just several weeks out from the primary on March 5th.

61
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:23,100
So regardless of figuring out what

62
00:05:25,848 --> 00:05:30,392
what we need to do to get this elections department, the funding and oversight that it needs to do its job effectively.

63
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:40,562
I think the timing of having the main office staff person leave so close to an election is frustrating to say the least.

64
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:50,791
So I'm sure we'll talk more about that, but my guess is that we won't really be able to engage anyone from that office until after the primary at this point.

65
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:56,930
just because I know that they're running around working really hard to get it done.

66
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:06,492
I trust in their efforts and the work that they're putting in, but I know that there is now only one full-time staff person working elections.

67
00:06:06,512 --> 00:06:08,832
We used to have five.

68
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,093
So that is obviously a huge challenge.

69
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:17,394
Last thing on here is just reviewing the relevant city ordinances and regulations.

70
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:19,894
I think we've talked about this in every other committee.

71
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:21,495
There's a number of

72
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:23,395
outdated things.

73
00:06:24,996 --> 00:06:27,737
The most important one, biggest one being part one, the city charter, right?

74
00:06:27,777 --> 00:06:41,423
So we will be reviewing that, but I'm sure there are things in boards and commissions, officers and employees, the election section, and even taking a look at the special acts and the acts accepted by the council that could be worth our time.

75
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:44,504
But that's really all that's in the governing agenda.

76
00:06:44,544 --> 00:06:47,966
I know we also have the paper on committee, paper and committee from

77
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,612
Councilor Callahan about some pro-democracy reforms.

78
00:06:53,232 --> 00:06:57,173
That's also in committee, but that's my review of the governing agenda.

79
00:06:58,453 --> 00:07:06,615
Looking at it, there was nothing in the governing agenda that's missing from the meeting agenda from the papers and committee, so that's great.

80
00:07:08,615 --> 00:07:12,076
And I don't think we really had much else for this committee to take a look at.

81
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:15,057
I think the charter, it's a big enough project on its own.

82
00:07:17,085 --> 00:07:27,669
If there are other things from councillors or members of the public around the rules of the city council or additional stuff around elections, I'm sure, I mean, I'd love to talk about it.

83
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:29,349
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

84
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,770
Thank you, President Behrs.

85
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:44,635
I think seeing as there is a paper and committee about elections, maybe we can first take comments from councillors about charter reform if we have any comments from councillors at this time.

86
00:07:47,604 --> 00:07:48,465
Councilor Lazara.

87
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:51,986
So as far as charter review, I think there's something to be said.

88
00:07:52,026 --> 00:07:56,668
I know that the Charter Commission is interested in continuing there.

89
00:07:56,788 --> 00:08:11,034
I know they took a lot of votes recently among themselves about their stances on a few of the issues that they've wanted to review, and I think they're preparing

90
00:08:11,906 --> 00:08:20,591
their presentation and their final sort of stuff, but they weren't going to be able to present all of their final recommendations until the end of this year.

91
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:23,773
So that's, you know, 10 months away.

92
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:40,483
And I think it would be beneficial for our committee to have kind of, to be working in tandem with them, like, you know, sort of developing our own thoughts and ideas at the same time, and then, you know,

93
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:57,293
in some ways kind of acting as like a conference committee afterwards and combining ideas, taking some that might be recommendations from the commission and some from ours that make sense and presenting that all maybe to the state house after the fact.

94
00:08:58,514 --> 00:09:05,557
Just so that we're not wasting time, you know, trying to do everything one thing at a time, we can all be working at the same time towards the same goal.

95
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:08,358
So I don't see why we wouldn't do that.

96
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,599
That's just a thought.

97
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:11,896
Thank you, Councillor Lazar.

98
00:09:12,036 --> 00:09:15,018
Are there any other Councillors who want to speak on charter review?

99
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,260
Seeing none on Zoom.

100
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,321
Mr. Chair.

101
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:20,641
Yes.

102
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:24,023
I just want to say, you know, I appreciate the work of the study committee.

103
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:28,225
One person appointed them.

104
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:30,307
We've been elected.

105
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:36,851
And for me personally, I'm certainly willing to look at their recommendations.

106
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:44,916
But again, they're an appointed committee appointed by one person not appointed by even consult.

107
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:53,246
There was no consultation with the city council and the creation of the committee, never mind the appointment of its members or the charge that it has or or the.

108
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:57,691
I just want to I just think I would rather not.

109
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,080
I think we could take whatever they have at a certain point and begin our work of going through it.

110
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,321
But I think it should be procedurally, step by step.

111
00:10:06,902 --> 00:10:12,605
If there's additional material that they want to provide after we've started a certain date, then we can include that in our discussions.

112
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,705
And I think that's a great thing.

113
00:10:13,785 --> 00:10:15,566
But I don't think we should try to work.

114
00:10:15,686 --> 00:10:17,767
I would personally not prefer a tandem process.

115
00:10:17,807 --> 00:10:19,808
I think their process can work.

116
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:21,969
If there is a tandem process, I don't think it should be.

117
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:30,790
I still think that the work product of the Charter Study Committee should come to the council and then the council can submit something to the administration.

118
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:40,434
That's just my personal preference because I really, well, I understand that they're working hard and I appreciate the study that they've done and the conversations that they've had.

119
00:10:41,954 --> 00:10:46,476
There's a level of legitimacy and responsibility.

120
00:10:48,376 --> 00:10:53,720
that comes with being elected by the voters of the city versus being appointed by a single person.

121
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:05,767
And I think also, given just the way that the law works on the charter, technically, the study committee is just an advisory committee that's going to give a report.

122
00:11:05,787 --> 00:11:07,729
It doesn't have any force of effective law.

123
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,931
Well, I appreciate Councilor Zara's comments.

124
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:18,074
I just wouldn't want it to be like conference committee, like Senate and House, like, you know, if they don't agree, we don't do it.

125
00:11:18,174 --> 00:11:24,137
I don't think that that's, you know, at the end of the day, we're the ones who were elected to vote on this.

126
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:35,063
And so if we disagree with the study committee on a recommendation that they make, then the version that we agree to in this chamber would be the one that would be submitted to the mayor, in my view.

127
00:11:35,923 --> 00:11:37,724
Or at least that's the process I would like to follow.

128
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,820
I think that's all I have to say.

129
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,361
Personally.

130
00:11:42,381 --> 00:11:42,722
Thank you.

131
00:11:42,742 --> 00:11:43,722
Thank you, Councilor Bears.

132
00:11:44,463 --> 00:11:57,151
Uh it sounds like there's a question about when we should start talking about, um, the art within the City Council Governance Committee about the city charter.

133
00:11:57,531 --> 00:11:59,753
Is there a motion to move it up in the

134
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:06,526
What is the timeline right now?

135
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:09,547
It currently starts in June, I believe.

136
00:12:09,787 --> 00:12:10,747
I think we should move it up.

137
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:13,928
I motion that we should move it up.

138
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:19,610
I hear a motion from Councilor Zara to move it up in the governance agenda timeline.

139
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,092
Is there a- I don't know, maybe April even.

140
00:12:25,532 --> 00:12:27,872
I mean, it does sound reasonable.

141
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:30,193
Do we have time to do that in April?

142
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:37,252
This committee meets, I mean, maybe the April meeting of this committee can be the first.

143
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:45,239
Because for me, I know that the Collins Center has met with the study committee, and they've had their subcommittees on different issues, and I think there's a ton of value there.

144
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,406
I think the general framework of what they've been working on, from what I've been reading coming out of the reports, just structurally makes a lot of sense.

145
00:12:53,487 --> 00:12:58,732
there is a section that describes what the powers of X are or the timeline for Y are like.

146
00:12:59,353 --> 00:13:08,081
And so I don't, and I'm guessing at this point that the study committee is not, um, at least from the reports I've read, they're not like deciding what the basics are.

147
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:18,711
So I think maybe in April, if the call center could come and give us some of the information that they've given to the study committee, we could, we could get going on, on some of the questions.

148
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:23,593
If we agree to a structure, then we can go through those big bucket issues as well.

149
00:13:24,354 --> 00:13:31,318
If there are items where they've taken votes and issued a report out of their subcommittee, then we could take that information and start working there.

150
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:37,501
If there are areas of the charter where they haven't made any determinations or votes, then maybe we could hold those off to the fall.

151
00:13:38,462 --> 00:13:39,983
I don't think it's reasonable.

152
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:43,284
I don't think the timeline of we're not going to get anything.

153
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:46,166
For me, December is way too late.

154
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:55,565
It is, you know, I also just don't like the idea that we wouldn't be able to consider things until they've issued a final complete report.

155
00:13:55,765 --> 00:14:10,331
And not that you were saying that, but I think that they, that may be something that, I don't know what their opinion is or what the study committee's opinion is on that, but I think we should, I personally would not be willing to wait 10 months for a final report before we start considering it.

156
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:12,772
And I would support the motion to start even earlier than June.

157
00:14:13,223 --> 00:14:14,924
Yeah, I, can I?

158
00:14:15,325 --> 00:14:18,067
Yes, Council Member Zora.

159
00:14:18,468 --> 00:14:29,297
I think that we're saying a lot of the same things with different words, but when I said in tandem, I meant like, we can start working while they're still working, basically.

160
00:14:29,977 --> 00:14:34,621
So, and since this stuff, this committee only meets once a month?

161
00:14:35,655 --> 00:14:36,636
committee only meets once a month.

162
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:46,784
So we're, you know, it's going to take a while, I think we should just get started with what we can get started on when we can, and then, you know, acknowledge that it's going to just take a while.

163
00:14:47,865 --> 00:14:50,707
So yes, Councilman.

164
00:14:50,747 --> 00:14:52,048
My apologies if I misinterpreted.

165
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:53,889
I think we are saying a lot of the same thing.

166
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:54,050
Yeah.

167
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:54,510
Yeah.

168
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:57,156
Okay, no comments on Zoom so far.

169
00:14:58,117 --> 00:14:59,438
No hands raised that I see.

170
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:12,090
So on Councilor Lazarus' motion to move the charter review item in the timeline to April, to begin in April, seconded by Councilor Bears.

171
00:15:12,931 --> 00:15:15,974
Mr. Clerk, can you call the roll?

172
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:17,936
I think Councilor Collins is online, so.

173
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:18,977
Hang on a second.

174
00:15:19,137 --> 00:15:19,398
No worries.

175
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:33,796
And as chair, I can reach out to the call-in center as well to see if they're willing to come to our April meeting with a baseline of recommendations that they're ready to present.

176
00:15:34,576 --> 00:15:36,118
Mr. Clerk, can you call the roll, please?

177
00:15:36,158 --> 00:15:36,378
Sure.

178
00:15:36,938 --> 00:15:37,619
President Behrs.

179
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:38,820
Yes.

180
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:40,341
Vice President Collins.

181
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:41,442
Yes.

182
00:15:42,603 --> 00:15:43,524
Councilor Lazaro.

183
00:15:43,924 --> 00:15:44,125
Yes.

184
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,094
Councilor Scarpelli is absent, Chair Seng.

185
00:15:47,394 --> 00:15:51,257
Yes, that's four in favor, one absent.

186
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:52,257
Zero opposed.

187
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:53,458
Zero opposed.

188
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:01,243
Moving on to the paper and committee about elections.

189
00:16:01,303 --> 00:16:03,444
That's 23-474.

190
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:09,668
This was originally offered by Vice President Behrs to ask the Elections Commission for a

191
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:22,385
for a presentation, a report titled the 2023 Municipal Elections Process Errors and Accountability Report, which we got back at an earlier meeting.

192
00:16:22,405 --> 00:16:29,272
At that meeting, Councillor Scarpelli offered some amendments.

193
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:41,033
for this committee to meet with the Elections Commission election staff to review the report, ask for updates, and ask for ways that Council can be more supportive.

194
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:48,477
He also asked for additional information which we received from Chair Miller of the Elections Commission.

195
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:53,459
As Councillor Behrs said, given how busy the Elections Office is,

196
00:16:55,609 --> 00:17:02,171
We wanted to give them their time and space to work on getting the presidential preference primary out of the way first.

197
00:17:03,411 --> 00:17:15,734
But I wanted to open the discussion up to any questions that we might want to collect, questions or recommendations that we might want to collect and send to the Elections Commission.

198
00:17:15,754 --> 00:17:25,017
Are there any councillors who want to speak on the Elections Commission and the elections report that we've received?

199
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,300
I see Vice President Collins' hand raised on Zoom.

200
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:31,800
I'll call on her.

201
00:17:34,062 --> 00:17:34,863
Thank you, Chair Tsai.

202
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:48,333
As for the elections commission, I think that I would just really love for the conversation that we had the last time the election commission came before us in a regular meeting.

203
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:57,556
I think the most helpful instructions that I would like forwarded to the elections commission would just be the meeting notes from that part of our discussion.

204
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:03,798
In my estimation, I think the council was pretty unified in just wanting

205
00:18:06,081 --> 00:18:16,244
a more explicit and a more specific response to the questions that we laid out in the original paper requesting the election after report.

206
00:18:16,944 --> 00:18:19,585
And so that's, as one counselor, that's what I'll be looking for.

207
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:20,466
That's what I'm hoping for.

208
00:18:20,486 --> 00:18:26,708
And I think that that was pretty well articulated by many counselors who spoke in our last conversation about it with the Elections Commission.

209
00:18:27,848 --> 00:18:28,128
Thank you.

210
00:18:29,636 --> 00:18:30,877
Thank you, Councillor Collins.

211
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:33,879
Are there any more Councillors who want to speak on elections?

212
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:34,980
Councillor Paris.

213
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:42,145
I would just note that that was at a regular meeting, so we don't have like a verbatim transcript, per se, of what the requests were.

214
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:49,751
I believe we did make some motions, and I'm not sure if that's in the... Can I borrow your committee report, please?

215
00:18:51,793 --> 00:18:56,136
Requesting that governance meet with Elections Commission staff to review the reforms of the report.

216
00:18:58,177 --> 00:18:59,578
renewed requests for attendance record.

217
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:02,101
So I believe we got the attendance records from Chairman Lawrence.

218
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:03,422
Yes, we did.

219
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:22,221
Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, having spoken with members of the Elections Commission, they want to do an updated version of the more clear after action report that is responsive to here was a problem, here was the

220
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:27,733
solution, you know, that's kind of itemizing it out and saying here was an issue.

221
00:19:27,753 --> 00:19:30,235
Here's what we identified as the problem with that issue.

222
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:34,638
Here's the solution that we're implementing to avoid that happening in the future.

223
00:19:34,818 --> 00:19:45,026
So I don't have any more motions to make, but I think just inviting them back to probably our March meeting and maybe even our April meetings.

224
00:19:46,007 --> 00:19:46,227
Great.

225
00:19:46,848 --> 00:19:46,988
Yeah.

226
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:48,503
Yeah, I can do that.

227
00:19:49,324 --> 00:19:51,464
I can make sure they're invited to our next two meetings.

228
00:19:52,285 --> 00:19:56,046
Are there any other comments on the elections part of this agenda?

229
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:03,268
Seeing no hands on Zoom, I'll move on to the next paper and committee 24-024.

230
00:20:03,288 --> 00:20:03,508
This one is

231
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:16,911
It was offered by Councillor Callaghan at our second regular meeting in January, I believe.

232
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:27,840
And essentially, Councillor Callaghan referred the following pro-democracy reforms to study in our governance committee.

233
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:35,307
These include salaries for elected officials, public financing of elections, ranked choice voting for single elected offices, allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to vote,

234
00:20:37,288 --> 00:20:39,091
allowing non-citizen residents to vote.

235
00:20:43,303 --> 00:20:55,369
there's also a section about requesting that our committee prioritize the salary discussion, come to a recommendation before the end of this year, this calendar year, and to implement salaries starting in 2026.

236
00:20:55,549 --> 00:21:06,994
I believe that the Councillor's intentions are that we talk about this throughout the calendar year, and so I don't think there's any...

237
00:21:08,815 --> 00:21:21,996
intention to pass anything at this meeting, but I see the Councillor who offered this paper on Zoom, so I'll defer to Councillor Callaghan if you have anything to present to us for consideration.

238
00:21:22,944 --> 00:21:27,366
Thank you so much.

239
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:31,608
So yes, these are a number of pro-democracy reforms.

240
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:37,391
I just want to clarify for folks what I mean by pro-democracy reforms.

241
00:21:38,212 --> 00:21:46,136
These are things that ideally would help Medford have more people voting.

242
00:21:46,716 --> 00:22:06,604
have better actual voting rates throughout our population and or would allow for people who tend to be underserved by government and underrepresented to be better represented and better served.

243
00:22:08,965 --> 00:22:11,087
There are many of these that we could consider.

244
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:16,431
These are the ones that I think that we can consider most easily as a city council in Massachusetts.

245
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:30,162
So the reason why the salaries for elected officials are prioritized is because if any salaries are going to be raised

246
00:22:31,442 --> 00:22:53,693
then I personally would prefer, even though this isn't a law on our books, there are cities in Massachusetts and in other places around the country that have laws that say that if salaries are going to be raised, that they need to be decided in the first 18 months of the term, and they cannot take effect until the next term.

247
00:22:54,114 --> 00:22:58,136
So the idea of having a recommendation finished by December 31st,

248
00:22:59,236 --> 00:23:08,660
out of this committee means that the council could then make a decision before June, which would be within the first 18 months of the term.

249
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,041
So that's the reason behind that particular issue.

250
00:23:11,461 --> 00:23:14,182
But I will say there is no rush on any of these.

251
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:15,783
Nothing needs to be decided.

252
00:23:15,803 --> 00:23:16,603
There's also no

253
00:23:17,904 --> 00:23:19,525
There's no legal language on any of these.

254
00:23:19,585 --> 00:23:25,030
So this really is just an opening discussion and no rush on any of these.

255
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,992
There's no particular timeline for them.

256
00:23:27,092 --> 00:23:34,298
So whenever it pleases this particular committee to put them on the agenda, I would be happy to appear again.

257
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,121
Thank you, Councillor Callaghan.

258
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:42,445
Are there any other comments on this paper at this time from councillors?

259
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:55,940
Seeing none, seeing no hands on Zoom, do we have any, I guess, I'll open this meeting up to public participation.

260
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:01,104
Are there any comments from the public on any of the papers that we've been talking about tonight?

261
00:24:03,927 --> 00:24:08,671
Seeing none, are there any motions for any of these papers?

262
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:10,632
Motion.

263
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:15,840
Motion to receive 24006 and place on file.

264
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:18,781
And adjourn.

265
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:28,625
Motion from Councillor Burrus to receive 24006, to receive and place on file, and seconded by Councillor Lozaro.

266
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:30,986
Mr. Clerk, both of you are second.

267
00:24:35,087 --> 00:24:36,088
And adjourn, sorry.

268
00:24:47,864 --> 00:24:48,907
and I can do the roll call, great.

269
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:51,234
Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?

270
00:24:52,156 --> 00:24:52,718
From the public?

271
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:56,047
Oh, Councilor Calderon.

272
00:24:57,046 --> 00:24:57,386
Thank you.

273
00:24:58,027 --> 00:25:13,713
In our last meeting, not the last meeting, but one of the meetings we had yesterday, I believe that the clerk said that if we receive and place on file, then we're essentially putting it away to not look at again.

274
00:25:13,793 --> 00:25:15,834
We have to reopen it if we need to.

275
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:21,456
Doesn't this just remain as something that is, don't we need to not receive and place this on file?

276
00:25:24,498 --> 00:25:25,398
I'm asking maybe the clerk.

277
00:25:27,677 --> 00:25:28,538
Are you asking me?

278
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:32,201
I am, thank you.

279
00:25:33,222 --> 00:25:34,403
I think you can reopen it.

280
00:25:35,223 --> 00:25:37,065
I also think you can move to leave it in committee.

281
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:48,415
My understanding is that if you receive and place on file, it gets disposed of, but that would be the will of the committee if the committee votes for that.

282
00:25:50,097 --> 00:25:51,838
Council members, do you have a?

283
00:25:51,918 --> 00:26:01,805
Yeah, my intent here, at least my intent was referring these out was that like the committees would look at the draft once and make sure that it matched up with what they had in committee.

284
00:26:02,566 --> 00:26:11,412
And then we set up alternatively the six, 12 and 18 month review of the governing agenda in committee of the whole.

285
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:15,455
So we'll still come back to it and I'm sure anyone can file

286
00:26:16,414 --> 00:26:18,716
you know, to review the governing agenda at any time.

287
00:26:18,796 --> 00:26:32,830
But I don't, honestly, I feel a little wary keeping it on the papers and committee because then already having the governing agenda on means basically you can just talk about anything you want at any time, which is a little, I don't know.

288
00:26:33,871 --> 00:26:35,712
It's just, so there's a lot in here, right?

289
00:26:35,752 --> 00:26:37,454
And technically it's on the agenda.

290
00:26:38,535 --> 00:26:40,337
So technically by open meeting law,

291
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:45,220
you know, I mean, it's open meeting was a rabbit hole in and of itself.

292
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:54,744
It doesn't really make sense, but that's my intent by this motion is just to say, okay, we've, we've taken a look at this as it was amended by the full counseling committee of the whole in January.

293
00:26:56,065 --> 00:26:58,906
Everything that's on here is, is what should be on here.

294
00:26:58,966 --> 00:27:08,610
And then, you know, the vice president and I will put the governing agenda on for us to look back at in June again and see what progress we've made collectively across all the committees.

295
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,331
Thank you.

296
00:27:11,604 --> 00:27:18,346
And if you wanted, we could motion to add the pro-democracy reforms here under the governing agenda.

297
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:20,827
I just want to make sure everything matches.

298
00:27:22,568 --> 00:27:24,128
That's up to this committee.

299
00:27:24,368 --> 00:27:29,430
I don't know if there are any councillors who want to motion to that.

300
00:27:32,005 --> 00:27:33,466
It will also live in committee as well.

301
00:27:33,746 --> 00:27:35,787
So it's on our agenda.

302
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:36,808
Right.

303
00:27:36,848 --> 00:27:37,768
And that's really more of us.

304
00:27:37,808 --> 00:27:38,509
Just let's make sure.

305
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:42,891
I knew there were some items that weren't here that didn't make it onto agendas yet.

306
00:27:42,971 --> 00:27:45,612
So I wanted committees to have a chance to discuss.

307
00:27:45,673 --> 00:27:45,753
Yeah.

308
00:27:47,264 --> 00:27:48,505
I think that totally makes sense.

309
00:27:49,605 --> 00:27:54,987
It's also my understanding, as we've said in many council meetings before, that the governing agenda is a working document.

310
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,228
It's a living and breathing document.

311
00:27:56,268 --> 00:28:00,850
So we can reopen it at any time and adjust to it.

312
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:05,312
Thank you for that question, Councilor Callahan.

313
00:28:06,373 --> 00:28:08,614
Mr. Clerk, could you please call the roll?

314
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:10,714
President Behrs?

315
00:28:10,935 --> 00:28:11,155
Yes.

316
00:28:11,455 --> 00:28:12,295
Vice President Collins?

317
00:28:13,676 --> 00:28:13,896
Yes.

318
00:28:15,096 --> 00:28:15,977
Councilor Lazaro?

319
00:28:16,704 --> 00:28:24,645
Yes, Councilor Scarpelli is absent chair saying, yes, four in favor zero opposed, and one absent.

320
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:26,168
The meeting is now adjourned.
