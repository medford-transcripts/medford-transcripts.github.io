00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:04,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello and welcome to this regular meeting of the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals.

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:07,758
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a quick roll call and then we'll get started.

3
00:00:10,961 --> 00:00:11,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim?

4
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:13,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Present.

5
00:00:13,504 --> 00:00:14,485
Mary Lee?

6
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:15,085
Present.

7
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:33,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Andre?

8
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:39,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Can folks hear me?

9
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:41,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've got you.

10
00:00:41,593 --> 00:00:42,414
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's Andre's.

11
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:46,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, I see Andre is present.

12
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:49,078
[SPEAKER_05]: So he'll work to resolve the audio issues.

13
00:00:49,678 --> 00:00:50,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Christy Evetta?

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:51,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Yvette Velez?

16
00:00:55,482 --> 00:00:55,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Present.

17
00:00:56,763 --> 00:00:57,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike Caldera, present.

18
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:00,792
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so we have a quorum.

19
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:02,373
[SPEAKER_05]: We can get started.

20
00:01:02,434 --> 00:01:03,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis, could you please kick us off?

21
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:04,515
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

22
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:12,961
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, the first thing I want to do is that we got a request to continue 121 2nd Street from the attorney.

23
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:22,168
[SPEAKER_15]: We've received an email from them just asking if they could continue that to the meeting on, sorry, my calendar is a bit wonky right now.

24
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:24,469
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll be July 31st.

25
00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:24,870
[SPEAKER_05]: July 31st, OK.

26
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:30,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so we got an email.

27
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:32,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have anyone present for that one?

28
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:38,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

29
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:42,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, well, we haven't heard any.

30
00:01:43,014 --> 00:01:46,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Testimony in that case, so customarily we will just continue.

31
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:54,339
[SPEAKER_05]: These cases, if so requested by the applicant, so chair awaits a motion to continue this matter.

32
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:57,040
[SPEAKER_05]: To our next regular meeting on July 31st.

33
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:00,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion.

34
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:02,469
[SPEAKER_05]: So the second.

35
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:03,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

36
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,610
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

37
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:06,752
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a roll call.

38
00:02:08,013 --> 00:02:08,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim.

39
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:09,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

40
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:10,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary.

41
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:11,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

42
00:02:12,777 --> 00:02:13,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre.

43
00:02:13,257 --> 00:02:15,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

44
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:16,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris.

45
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:18,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

46
00:02:19,342 --> 00:02:19,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Yvette.

47
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:22,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

48
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:23,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike.

49
00:02:23,826 --> 00:02:23,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

50
00:02:24,386 --> 00:02:24,646
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

51
00:02:24,947 --> 00:02:26,548
[SPEAKER_05]: That one's continued to our next meeting.

52
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:28,970
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, what's next, Dennis?

53
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:34,193
[SPEAKER_15]: The next matter is 38 Harvard Avenue, case number A-2024-03.

54
00:02:34,213 --> 00:02:51,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Applicant and owner OB's Automotive Collision Center are requesting a six-month extension on a variance granted by the Board of Appeals with the decision dated on June 14th, 2024 and filed on June 27th, 2024 until December 14th, 2025 to sell class two used motor vehicles at 38 Harvard Avenue.

55
00:02:52,204 --> 00:02:52,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dennis.

56
00:02:52,784 --> 00:02:54,505
[SPEAKER_05]: I see we have attorney Desmond here for the applicant.

57
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:57,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, Chairman Calderia, board members.

58
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:05,115
[SPEAKER_01]: I had requested this extension under the what was, I believe, the current law.

59
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:17,822
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I sent to Dennis today as I was looking at this this evening in the Massachusetts Economic Leadership Act, which Governor Healey signed in late November.

60
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:26,700
[SPEAKER_01]: It appears that, and I sent you both, KP Law had a update, and also I sent you the portion of the statute, section 280.

61
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:34,123
[SPEAKER_01]: The statute itself is this much double-sided paper, so it's a little difficult to see where it is.

62
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:39,685
[SPEAKER_01]: But in any event, it appears that any variance in existence between

63
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:50,673
[SPEAKER_01]: January of 2023 and January of 2025 is automatically extended if it was in existence by operation of law for a period of two years.

64
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:55,115
[SPEAKER_01]: And the statute itself specifically deals with chapter 48.

65
00:03:56,355 --> 00:03:58,856
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've had an opportunity to look at it.

66
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:03,678
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw it at quarter of six tonight and sent it along to you.

67
00:04:04,838 --> 00:04:09,660
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wanted to at least know that the board would be willing to grant a six month extension.

68
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:17,558
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran into a little bit of an issue with the application for the license that needs to go before City Council for approval.

69
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:27,163
[SPEAKER_01]: The applicant is now required to obtain the certificate of compliance with the DOR and that took a little bit of time to set up the account.

70
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:31,490
[SPEAKER_01]: The EIN number had to be worked out and then it came to tax season.

71
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,792
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the tax returns had to be filed.

72
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:38,796
[SPEAKER_01]: And once those were filed, the workers' compensation certificate was due to expire.

73
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:42,780
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just been kind of trying to get things in the right order and all.

74
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,601
[SPEAKER_01]: in good standing to bring it before the council.

75
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:54,945
[SPEAKER_01]: We have taken all of the reports that are required from the admissible departments, all but the traffic is in.

76
00:04:55,325 --> 00:05:01,588
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in a position to go before the city council within within a month or so anyway.

77
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

78
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, customarily, that's something that we would typically vote to

79
00:05:10,898 --> 00:05:12,039
[SPEAKER_05]: agree to the extension.

80
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:15,982
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like under the new law, you don't even need us to take action.

81
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:21,226
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Attorney Desmond, are you comfortable proceeding without the board taking a vote in light of that?

82
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:37,998
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like the board to take a vote just on the six months in case there's some exception, excluding Kathleen A. Desmond's variances that were granted, something wonky of that nature, just to know that under the old ordinance or under statute, I would still be valid and still have the six month extension.

83
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:38,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

84
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:39,999
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, sounds good.

85
00:05:40,826 --> 00:05:42,447
[SPEAKER_05]: thoughts from members of the board?

86
00:05:49,971 --> 00:05:55,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearing none, chair awaits a motion to grant the six-month extension.

87
00:05:57,235 --> 00:05:57,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion.

88
00:05:58,756 --> 00:05:59,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

89
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:00,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

90
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:02,698
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we'll take a roll call.

91
00:06:02,718 --> 00:06:03,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Yvette?

92
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:09,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Yvette?

93
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, sorry, technical difficulties too.

94
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:14,641
[SPEAKER_04]: No worries.

95
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:15,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

96
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:19,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris.

97
00:06:20,282 --> 00:06:20,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

98
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:21,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre.

99
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:23,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

100
00:06:24,563 --> 00:06:24,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary.

101
00:06:25,523 --> 00:06:25,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

102
00:06:26,664 --> 00:06:26,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim.

103
00:06:27,544 --> 00:06:27,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

104
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:28,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike.

105
00:06:29,204 --> 00:06:29,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

106
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:30,165
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

107
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:32,185
[SPEAKER_05]: You have your extension.

108
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:33,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

109
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:34,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a nice 4th of July, folks.

110
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:35,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, you too.

111
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:38,687
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

112
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:39,667
[SPEAKER_15]: What's next, Dennis?

113
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,439
[SPEAKER_15]: Next is 173 Arlington Street.

114
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:55,769
[SPEAKER_15]: Applicant and owner, Don Foote, to install an addition of 173 Arlington Street within the side yard setback extending existing side yard setback nonconformity, which is not allowed per the City Methods Zoning Ordinance Chapter 94 Table of Dimensional Requirements.

115
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:57,550
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, great.

116
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,993
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see we do have a Don Foote on the call.

117
00:07:01,674 --> 00:07:02,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello and welcome.

118
00:07:05,317 --> 00:07:05,517
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

119
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:06,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear me?

120
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:07,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we can hear you.

121
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:08,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

122
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:18,602
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a tiny 910-square-foot single-family home that's in antique and in disrepair.

123
00:07:21,464 --> 00:07:33,334
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to just extend the rear out 12.5 feet, the exact width of the house so we can have a three-bedroom, two-bath home.

124
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:37,117
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty much it.

125
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:47,527
[SPEAKER_05]: My understanding is that in extending the home in this way, you're not creating any new non-conformities.

126
00:07:47,587 --> 00:07:48,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right?

127
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:50,750
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just extending an existing non-conformity?

128
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Just extending an existing non-conformity.

129
00:07:54,353 --> 00:08:00,779
[SPEAKER_13]: The right side non-conformity, which is we're 2 and 1⁄2 feet from the right side setback.

130
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:02,040
[SPEAKER_13]: We're supposed to be 7 and 1⁄2 feet.

131
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,022
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to extend that straight back.

132
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:12,602
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so in light of that, the standard we need to apply here is the special permit standard.

133
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:21,646
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there's no substantial detriment to the public good, then that would be allowable under the Medford ordinance.

134
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:24,747
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mr. Foote, did you want to?

135
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:29,285
[SPEAKER_05]: show us plans or anything, or have Dennis present those?

136
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:30,967
[SPEAKER_13]: I've submitted plans.

137
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:37,151
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a very modest addition of about 440 square feet.

138
00:08:37,171 --> 00:08:48,479
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to still have a very modest home of 1,300 and something square feet, so I don't think we're really impacting the neighborhood in any

139
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,523
[SPEAKER_13]: way, except we're going to totally rehab the house and make it beautiful again.

140
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:57,287
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a beautiful older home that's just been falling into disrepair.

141
00:08:58,888 --> 00:08:59,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Dennis.

142
00:08:59,368 --> 00:09:01,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you maybe just pull that up?

143
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:01,611
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, great.

144
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:04,313
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, I forgot to say this at the beginning.

145
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:08,757
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have six members of the board present, five vote.

146
00:09:08,837 --> 00:09:14,122
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm appointing every member except for myself as voting members on this one.

147
00:09:18,712 --> 00:09:27,077
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so looks like we have a lot that's got 35 foot of frontage, but it's also 35 foot wide.

148
00:09:29,558 --> 00:09:37,322
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, yeah, the existing dwelling is about two and a half foot from this orientation left side.

149
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:42,105
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the addition is just extending a little bit back.

150
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:47,268
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, I'll open it up to questions from the board.

151
00:10:00,662 --> 00:10:03,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not seeing any questions from the board.

152
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:09,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just say it looks straightforward to me, so I do not have any questions.

153
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:14,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll now open it up to public comment.

154
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,172
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a member of the public and you'd like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

155
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:22,394
[SPEAKER_05]: You can raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera and raise your hand.

156
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:27,617
[SPEAKER_05]: You can type in the chat, or you can email dennisdmcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

157
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:45,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not see any members of the public who would like to speak on this matter.

158
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:51,134
[SPEAKER_05]: So the chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberations.

159
00:10:56,538 --> 00:10:56,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion.

160
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:58,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a second?

161
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

162
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,642
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we'll take a roll call.

163
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:03,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim?

164
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:04,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

165
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:05,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre?

166
00:11:05,724 --> 00:11:05,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

167
00:11:06,744 --> 00:11:08,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris?

168
00:11:09,026 --> 00:11:09,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

169
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:10,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary?

170
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:10,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

171
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I. All right, the board is now deliberating.

172
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:18,094
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, folks?

173
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:28,743
[SPEAKER_07]: I can start.

174
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:31,585
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like a great improvement to the home.

175
00:11:31,945 --> 00:11:37,690
[SPEAKER_07]: The addition is pretty minimal, including the dormers addition on top.

176
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,272
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think it's a small,

177
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:46,074
[SPEAKER_07]: existing and small addition, in all honesty.

178
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:48,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

179
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:50,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Other thoughts from the board?

180
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:02,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none.

181
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:08,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so even though this isn't part of the standard, I mean, there's no real

182
00:12:08,692 --> 00:12:10,653
[SPEAKER_05]: other way to extend this building.

183
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:15,154
[SPEAKER_05]: So it happens to be too close in the side yard setback.

184
00:12:15,394 --> 00:12:16,615
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not making it any worse.

185
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Seems like there's not any members of the public raising concerns.

186
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:26,058
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not seeing a substantial detriment here.

187
00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:31,920
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not voting, but in general, I think it meets the standard.

188
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,680
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

189
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:35,021
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

190
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:37,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Other thoughts from the board?

191
00:12:44,337 --> 00:12:46,998
[SPEAKER_05]: being none, chair awaits a motion.

192
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:48,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, did you have something you wanted to say, Andre?

193
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:49,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

194
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:53,261
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was just going to underscore what Yvette said.

195
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:53,781
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

196
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:54,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

197
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:59,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair awaits a motion on this matter.

198
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:05,366
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a request for a special permit to extend the existing non-conformity.

199
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:11,288
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved.

200
00:13:11,843 --> 00:13:13,544
[SPEAKER_05]: But technically, I didn't make a motion.

201
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:17,848
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to have to.

202
00:13:17,948 --> 00:13:18,008
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

203
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:22,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve the special permit for 173 Arlington Street.

204
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:23,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have a second?

205
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:25,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll second.

206
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:27,176
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

207
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:28,957
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a roll call vote.

208
00:13:29,378 --> 00:13:29,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Yvette?

209
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:30,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

210
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

211
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:33,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary?

212
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:34,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

213
00:13:34,782 --> 00:13:35,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris?

214
00:13:35,923 --> 00:13:36,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

215
00:13:37,144 --> 00:13:37,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre?

216
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:38,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

217
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:39,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim?

218
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:40,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

219
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,125
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, your special permit is approved.

220
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:45,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks so much.

221
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:47,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Appreciate your help.

222
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:55,133
[SPEAKER_15]: And Don, so now in this situation, I'm the one who writes up the decision.

223
00:13:55,893 --> 00:14:03,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Luckily for you in this instance, your neighbors had a very similar, pretty much the exact same case, you know, a few months ago.

224
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,563
[SPEAKER_15]: So I basically had that decision pretty much written and it's already been like checked by our legal counsel.

225
00:14:08,603 --> 00:14:14,347
[SPEAKER_15]: So I should just be able to, you know, go through it and just make sure that, you know, change some things out to,

226
00:14:15,478 --> 00:14:16,318
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, for yours.

227
00:14:16,378 --> 00:14:18,198
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think the turnaround in yours should be pretty quick.

228
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:25,480
[SPEAKER_15]: So once the decision's written and approved and signed by the members, then it gets filed in the city clerk's office.

229
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,940
[SPEAKER_15]: That starts a 20 days appeals period.

230
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:44,243
[SPEAKER_15]: At the conclusion of that 20 days appeals period, you know, you just go to the clerk's office, get a letter basically saying there's been no appeal, file that decision at the Middlesex South Courthouse, and then you can get your building permit.

231
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:46,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, thanks so much, Dennis.

232
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:50,148
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think I still need to do a ConCom application with you, correct?

233
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:50,768
[SPEAKER_15]: You do, yes.

234
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:55,949
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm out tomorrow, but on Monday, give me a call, and we can start going through that process.

235
00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:01,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I should have all my paperwork together by beginning next week.

236
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,490
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll see you then.

237
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:02,850
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

238
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:03,710
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, everyone.

239
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:05,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

240
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:05,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Good night.

241
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:08,831
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, what's next, Dennis?

242
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:17,472
[SPEAKER_15]: There we go.

243
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:18,152
[SPEAKER_15]: 58 Myrtle Street.

244
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:33,955
[SPEAKER_15]: Applicant and owner Bartlett Development LLC to alter and extend an existing single family residence at 58 Myrtle Street within the side yard setback extending existing side yard setback nonconformity and add a third floor which is not allowed for the City of Medford Zoning Ordinance Chapter 94 Table of Dimensional Requirements.

245
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:36,716
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thank you.

246
00:15:36,976 --> 00:15:41,437
[SPEAKER_05]: For this case, again, I'll be appointing the other members of the board as voting members.

247
00:15:41,997 --> 00:15:42,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have

248
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:47,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have the applicant or representative for the applicant present?

249
00:15:47,973 --> 00:15:50,274
[SPEAKER_16]: Attorney Bill O'Keefe, online.

250
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:52,416
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, welcome.

251
00:15:52,456 --> 00:15:53,176
[SPEAKER_16]: Great, you can hear me.

252
00:15:53,396 --> 00:15:56,979
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate everybody's time on this cool night.

253
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Just wanted to give an update with regards to the applicant.

254
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:07,986
[SPEAKER_16]: He's just proposing to alter and extend an existing, pre-existing, non-conforming, single-family residence on Morell Street.

255
00:16:08,306 --> 00:16:10,788
[SPEAKER_16]: The existing structure right now is a one-story home.

256
00:16:11,453 --> 00:16:14,956
[SPEAKER_16]: with a small attic and a non-conforming due to the side setbacks.

257
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:21,922
[SPEAKER_16]: The proposed work includes a vertical expansion to the removal of the existing roof and construction of a full second floor.

258
00:16:22,836 --> 00:16:32,502
[SPEAKER_16]: Additionally, the project includes a horizontal expansion of the building footprint by approximately 4 feet to accommodate the reconfiguration of the exterior living space.

259
00:16:33,163 --> 00:16:43,149
[SPEAKER_16]: A new level is also being proposed above the 2nd floor, which contained an unfinished storage area and remain below the threshold that would constitute a full 3rd story.

260
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:43,389
[SPEAKER_16]: Um.

261
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:54,260
[SPEAKER_16]: While the dormant areas are included in the added design, the building will remain compliant with the zoning definition of a two-and-a-half-story structure.

262
00:16:55,281 --> 00:17:04,284
[SPEAKER_16]: The total gross living area will increase from approximately 1,435 square feet to 29 and 24 square feet.

263
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:14,747
[SPEAKER_16]: The project doesn't increase the degree of non-conformity related to the existing site setbacks and does not propose to add any new conforming elements.

264
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:25,522
[SPEAKER_16]: We proposed a few of the plans so that the board can see and just seeking relief with regards to the special permit.

265
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:31,307
[SPEAKER_16]: I know when I did the description, I was working with Dennis on this too as well.

266
00:17:31,347 --> 00:17:34,089
[SPEAKER_16]: The work description was to add a dormitory to this property.

267
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,694
[SPEAKER_16]: That was to stop my narrative and unfortunately I couldn't switch

268
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:55,654
[SPEAKER_16]: The verbiage in there locked in on me when I sent the, the application, but I know there was some confusion with the, the commissioner and we worked through him and Dennis in order to get some clarity with regard to the scope of the work.

269
00:17:56,294 --> 00:18:01,237
[SPEAKER_16]: But I wanted to appreciate everybody's time in terms of processing this application with me.

270
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:03,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

271
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

272
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:04,640
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

273
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to see the plans, just so everyone has a shared awareness.

274
00:18:13,173 --> 00:18:18,856
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Attorney O'Keefe, is that something you can share, or Dennis, you could help Attorney O'Keefe share?

275
00:18:19,076 --> 00:18:20,336
[SPEAKER_16]: I have them with a file.

276
00:18:20,356 --> 00:18:25,039
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure if... I can bring them up.

277
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:28,661
[SPEAKER_15]: Which one do you want first, the plot plan or the architectural plans?

278
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:30,322
[SPEAKER_16]: I do the architectural plan.

279
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:34,144
[SPEAKER_16]: That'll give a big picture in terms of everything that's being done.

280
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:40,819
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure this board's aware of in terms of this area, in terms of the work and the scope that's being done over there.

281
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,623
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been a busy area.

282
00:18:48,246 --> 00:18:54,631
[SPEAKER_16]: Nothing that's going to impede or impact the neighborhood in terms of an architectural design.

283
00:18:54,671 --> 00:19:00,236
[SPEAKER_16]: It would fit in nicely with the current homes that are being developed over there.

284
00:19:00,987 --> 00:19:09,951
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, this is an older home, um, that just needs a little bit modernization and, um, space for, uh, for future families.

285
00:19:09,971 --> 00:19:15,754
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, great.

286
00:19:24,858 --> 00:19:29,320
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it looks like we're currently looking at the existing elevation.

287
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:29,940
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

288
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:46,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, and here are the proposed elevations.

289
00:19:47,907 --> 00:19:50,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Questions from the board so far?

290
00:20:00,772 --> 00:20:11,697
[SPEAKER_05]: One question I have is, functionally, what's the purpose of the dormers on the half floor up top?

291
00:20:13,007 --> 00:20:16,549
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems a bit unusual to have dormers for attic spaces.

292
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:19,570
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I believe they have the central area.

293
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:31,255
[SPEAKER_16]: Nelson, I'm not sure if you're on the call, but I know on the other slide, I think it'll show how the layout is for inside the dormer space.

294
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:34,616
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe that.

295
00:20:36,357 --> 00:20:36,737
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't.

296
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:41,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so on the right there, maybe if you could zoom in a little, Dennis.

297
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:52,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, so it looks like there's HVAC room on one side.

298
00:20:52,994 --> 00:21:01,800
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, yeah, and then the dormer looks like it maybe extends out past that.

299
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:02,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

300
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:03,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

301
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:20,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so if I'm understanding correctly, you think that maybe the HVAC was a factor, but you're not entirely sure.

302
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:25,187
[SPEAKER_16]: In terms of the design for the attic space, that's my understanding of it.

303
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:27,288
[SPEAKER_16]: And just for headroom.

304
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:29,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I see, okay.

305
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Other questions from the board?

306
00:21:39,336 --> 00:21:40,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Chair, yeah, through you.

307
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a question.

308
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:50,625
[SPEAKER_03]: So the four feet additional extension of the house, is that towards the garage?

309
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:51,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?

310
00:21:51,426 --> 00:21:52,966
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks wider, the new version.

311
00:21:53,587 --> 00:21:54,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks closer to the garage.

312
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:56,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe so.

313
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:03,252
[SPEAKER_03]: And is the existing garage staying the same?

314
00:22:03,272 --> 00:22:06,414
[SPEAKER_03]: That is my understanding, yes.

315
00:22:07,814 --> 00:22:08,475
[SPEAKER_16]: Same dimensions.

316
00:22:10,223 --> 00:22:10,843
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

317
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:11,364
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

318
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:18,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

319
00:22:18,928 --> 00:22:20,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Other questions from the board.

320
00:22:25,892 --> 00:22:26,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. chair.

321
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:26,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

322
00:22:27,193 --> 00:22:32,436
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could, I don't see the building commissioner on here, but I guess, is there a.

323
00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:50,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Thought seven and a half feet was a minimum for the third floor or habitable floor, but perhaps that's something that we could ask Attorney O'Keefe to do.

324
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:52,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, he was reviewing that.

325
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,801
[SPEAKER_16]: He had a question with regards to that.

326
00:22:55,181 --> 00:23:04,185
[SPEAKER_16]: I know he put something, let me just find out what he wrote, because he had some questions that we answered and I believe he's satisfied.

327
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,461
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, he he has something on file here too.

328
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:17,625
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, he just did the narrative of the project, but.

329
00:23:20,606 --> 00:23:23,848
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we're not looking to go above the 2 and a half story structure.

330
00:23:24,728 --> 00:23:27,969
[SPEAKER_16]: So, if the 7 and a half feet is an issue, then.

331
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:34,152
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we can come back and address that when the permits being pulled.

332
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,503
[SPEAKER_16]: So obviously, if it doesn't meet the building code, then we're not seeking relief for that.

333
00:23:40,523 --> 00:23:45,426
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll have to modify the design to meet that criteria.

334
00:23:47,707 --> 00:23:48,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.

335
00:23:48,328 --> 00:23:51,570
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be a building code issue, just out of curiosity.

336
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,531
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

337
00:23:53,811 --> 00:24:00,895
[SPEAKER_16]: I know he mentioned something about the roof line, but we're within the roof line criteria.

338
00:24:00,935 --> 00:24:03,777
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think that might have been something that he also had an issue with.

339
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:13,013
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, other questions from the board?

340
00:24:19,437 --> 00:24:24,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Not seeing any, so I will open the public portion of the hearing.

341
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:28,181
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a member of the public and you'd like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

342
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:33,084
[SPEAKER_05]: You can raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera and raise your hand, type in the chat, or you can...

343
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:49,571
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not seeing any members of the public who would like to speak on this matter.

344
00:24:49,591 --> 00:24:56,473
[SPEAKER_05]: So the chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

345
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:02,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Andre?

346
00:25:03,415 --> 00:25:06,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberations.

347
00:25:06,716 --> 00:25:08,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a second?

348
00:25:09,797 --> 00:25:10,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

349
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:11,658
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

350
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:12,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Yvette?

351
00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:16,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim.

352
00:25:18,535 --> 00:25:18,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

353
00:25:19,635 --> 00:25:19,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary.

354
00:25:20,715 --> 00:25:20,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

355
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:21,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris.

356
00:25:22,616 --> 00:25:22,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

357
00:25:23,616 --> 00:25:24,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre.

358
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:24,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

359
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:26,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim.

360
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:26,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

361
00:25:26,857 --> 00:25:28,977
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

362
00:25:29,017 --> 00:25:30,118
[SPEAKER_05]: We're now deliberating.

363
00:25:30,138 --> 00:25:31,058
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, folks?

364
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:45,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I ask why the city is not allowed to add a third floor?

365
00:25:48,468 --> 00:25:54,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'm not sure any of us could say that with certainty, Mary.

366
00:25:55,955 --> 00:26:02,862
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a long standing dimensional requirement in this district.

367
00:26:03,382 --> 00:26:11,490
[SPEAKER_05]: There's this distinction between a half floor and a full floor and it's measured as

368
00:26:13,117 --> 00:26:26,543
[SPEAKER_05]: whether the, I think the livable space above seven foot in height, whether that is or isn't more than 50% of the gross floor area of the floor below it.

369
00:26:27,784 --> 00:26:40,530
[SPEAKER_05]: And for whatever reason, when that ordinance was put into effect, they said this zone, two and a half is the max and this,

370
00:26:41,903 --> 00:26:45,344
[SPEAKER_05]: this proposal, to be clear, does meet that definition.

371
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:53,885
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I don't personally know specifically why they said not three stories in this zone.

372
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:57,826
[SPEAKER_16]: If I can, it's about overdevelopment back in the day.

373
00:27:00,927 --> 00:27:01,807
[SPEAKER_16]: That was a concern.

374
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:08,988
[SPEAKER_16]: But now with the housing crisis and everything taking place, everything's on the drawing board.

375
00:27:12,637 --> 00:27:12,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

376
00:27:14,598 --> 00:27:16,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Great thoughts from the board.

377
00:27:28,003 --> 00:27:31,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think this is out of character with some of the other properties on the street.

378
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:40,968
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think there's any kind of negative public impact of this and doesn't change the

379
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:53,081
[SPEAKER_03]: the footprint of the house itself, like in terms of being extended back or towards the neighbor on the left side doesn't, uh, doesn't seem to be any impact there.

380
00:27:53,101 --> 00:28:03,044
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, so Andre, just, just to be clear, there is a four foot horizontal expansion of the building footprint.

381
00:28:03,864 --> 00:28:06,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it's towards the garage towards the driveway.

382
00:28:06,404 --> 00:28:06,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

383
00:28:06,904 --> 00:28:07,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

384
00:28:07,204 --> 00:28:07,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

385
00:28:09,725 --> 00:28:09,985
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

386
00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:11,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.

387
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:12,875
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good, it seems like a good project.

388
00:28:14,196 --> 00:28:15,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

389
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:16,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Other thoughts from the board?

390
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I also agree with Andre and Chris.

391
00:28:21,381 --> 00:28:23,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a great project.

392
00:28:27,186 --> 00:28:28,187
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

393
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:29,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Other thoughts from the board?

394
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:44,734
[SPEAKER_05]: So to grant this relief, the standard is a special permit, so we would have to find no substantial detriment to the public good.

395
00:28:47,415 --> 00:28:51,117
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there's no other deliberation, Chair awaits a motion.

396
00:28:53,458 --> 00:29:00,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve the special permit for, I forget the address, 58 Myrtle Street.

397
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:01,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have a second?

398
00:29:02,642 --> 00:29:03,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll second.

399
00:29:04,483 --> 00:29:04,683
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

400
00:29:05,168 --> 00:29:06,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna take a roll call.

401
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:06,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim?

402
00:29:07,489 --> 00:29:07,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

403
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:08,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre?

404
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

405
00:29:11,092 --> 00:29:11,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris?

406
00:29:12,172 --> 00:29:12,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

407
00:29:12,973 --> 00:29:13,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary?

408
00:29:13,393 --> 00:29:14,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

409
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:14,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Beth?

410
00:29:15,094 --> 00:29:15,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

411
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:17,496
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

412
00:29:17,516 --> 00:29:20,077
[SPEAKER_04]: You have your special permit.

413
00:29:21,198 --> 00:29:22,219
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate everybody's time.

414
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:22,839
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much.

415
00:29:25,688 --> 00:29:30,409
[SPEAKER_15]: And Attorney O'Keefe, so basically deco what I sort of said before, you know, I'll work on the decision.

416
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:41,811
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, if you want, I can send you one to just sort of, if you wanted to do a draft to sort of expedite it a little quicker, I'll get you one in the next day or so, just so you can start in on it.

417
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:44,311
[SPEAKER_15]: And then that'll sort of move the process on a little quicker.

418
00:29:44,431 --> 00:29:44,631
[SPEAKER_15]: So.

419
00:29:44,811 --> 00:29:46,392
[SPEAKER_16]: No, Dennis, I appreciate your time.

420
00:29:46,412 --> 00:29:47,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much.

421
00:29:47,072 --> 00:29:49,712
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

422
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:50,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful.

423
00:29:50,732 --> 00:29:52,593
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

424
00:29:52,633 --> 00:29:53,333
[SPEAKER_04]: What's next, Dennis?

425
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:54,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks.

426
00:29:58,859 --> 00:29:59,880
[SPEAKER_15]: 141 Wall Street.

427
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:07,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Applicant and owner Lucy Siddall at a third floor at 141 Wall Street, which is an existing non-conforming structure in a single family, two zoning district.

428
00:30:07,204 --> 00:30:09,806
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not allowed for the City of Medford zoning ordinance.

429
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:16,109
[SPEAKER_15]: This will also extend the existing non-conforming front yard setback requiring a special permit for the City of Medford zoning ordinance.

430
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:21,052
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so we have Lucy Siddall on the call.

431
00:30:21,393 --> 00:30:22,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello and welcome.

432
00:30:22,113 --> 00:30:22,453
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here.

433
00:30:22,473 --> 00:30:24,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, welcome.

434
00:30:24,534 --> 00:30:25,875
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, can you hear me okay?

435
00:30:26,195 --> 00:30:26,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we can hear you.

436
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:27,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, great.

437
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:29,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, everyone.

438
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:30,440
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for your time.

439
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,200
[SPEAKER_12]: We apply for this.

440
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,782
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're actually a special permit with a zoning variance.

441
00:30:35,802 --> 00:30:36,463
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're doing both.

442
00:30:37,483 --> 00:30:40,405
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to finish our third floor added.

443
00:30:41,485 --> 00:30:43,386
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now it's lined up and not finished.

444
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:49,009
[SPEAKER_12]: And we want to, the special permit is for the dormers on both sides.

445
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:50,270
[SPEAKER_12]: One of them is for the stairs.

446
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,612
[SPEAKER_12]: Having a dormer is the only way we can get a flight of stairs up to the third floor.

447
00:30:55,598 --> 00:30:58,980
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the other dorm was to raise the ceiling height to have habitable space.

448
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:03,923
[SPEAKER_12]: And we wanted to make it a full third floor.

449
00:31:04,023 --> 00:31:17,651
[SPEAKER_12]: We had initially drafted it up to be what we thought was a half of the second floor, but we actually found out that permit for the closets and storage space are also counted as habitable.

450
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:22,954
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it was actually the building commissioner who proposed the idea of like, hey, you know,

451
00:31:24,211 --> 00:31:28,074
[SPEAKER_12]: go for the full third floor variance just so that you can get the space that you need.

452
00:31:29,275 --> 00:31:32,597
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, we, you know, my husband and I both work from home.

453
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,119
[SPEAKER_12]: He's a stay at home dad.

454
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:35,340
[SPEAKER_12]: I work from home full time.

455
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,601
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a kid.

456
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:39,042
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's, it's getting quite quiet then.

457
00:31:39,783 --> 00:31:40,684
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's you.

458
00:31:41,805 --> 00:31:45,427
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's, you know, we are also in an undersized lot.

459
00:31:45,527 --> 00:31:52,833
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't really have anywhere else to meaningfully expand to other than like a small mudroom that we'd like to put in that goes into our yard.

460
00:31:53,735 --> 00:32:03,685
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and we did also speak with our closest to butter, um, on aim street and did get their, uh, approval and support for our project as well.

461
00:32:04,285 --> 00:32:07,969
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, um, we're hopeful that we can move forward with the plan.

462
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:09,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

463
00:32:09,891 --> 00:32:10,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

464
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:16,837
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, one question I have upfront, I just want to make sure the board's understanding the

465
00:32:19,595 --> 00:32:25,799
[SPEAKER_05]: space that actually counts per the Medford ordinance on the plans.

466
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's best to go through it when the plans are up.

467
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:35,665
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I saw on the actual submission that the calculation was 49.8%.

468
00:32:36,065 --> 00:32:42,790
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm assuming that must have been before the building commissioner's clarification.

469
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:43,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right?

470
00:32:44,146 --> 00:32:44,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

471
00:32:44,686 --> 00:32:56,073
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that was what we, so what we understood, and our architect who had been on sort of other places with the boards, that was his, he wasn't sure, so he sort of didn't count the storage space, and so that was his calculation.

472
00:32:56,873 --> 00:33:07,139
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the building commissioner actually clarified to us via email that he was like, as it is, you're going to require a special permit because any storage space is counted as habitable.

473
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:10,161
[SPEAKER_12]: If any person is going to be there for any given amount of time, it counts here.

474
00:33:11,161 --> 00:33:13,743
[SPEAKER_12]: And so because of that, we adjusted our plans to try to

475
00:33:14,517 --> 00:33:28,086
[SPEAKER_12]: maximize our attic space to be livable since we were going to have to either wall it all off so we couldn't use it just to be able to just do a special permit, but we would love to be able to use that space for our family, so we went for the variance as well.

476
00:33:29,327 --> 00:33:30,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I see, okay.

477
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:39,033
[SPEAKER_05]: So the plans I'm looking at, they still have low ceilings in the storage areas.

478
00:33:39,073 --> 00:33:40,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there new plans with

479
00:33:42,307 --> 00:33:42,947
[SPEAKER_05]: with four?

480
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:49,510
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, our understanding is any storage area is still considered living space.

481
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,370
[SPEAKER_12]: That was what we were told.

482
00:33:51,251 --> 00:33:57,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, but you just said that you decided, okay, well, we're doing three floors anyway, so we might as well.

483
00:33:57,813 --> 00:34:02,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and I apologize for it, but the May 16th plan is our current plan.

484
00:34:02,515 --> 00:34:03,276
[SPEAKER_12]: That is our plan.

485
00:34:03,996 --> 00:34:04,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

486
00:34:05,436 --> 00:34:11,639
[SPEAKER_12]: If you don't have that, I'm happy to share my screen, but that's the plan that we're submitting for the zoning variance as well as a special permit.

487
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:18,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the plans I'm seeing are, I think they're dated April 19th.

488
00:34:19,553 --> 00:34:27,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, you're looking at the special permit one for the dorms, but I submitted a more recent one, so I can show it to you if you'd like me to share it.

489
00:34:28,117 --> 00:34:30,319
[SPEAKER_12]: Or I don't know if Dennis, that's something that you do?

490
00:34:32,002 --> 00:34:38,207
[SPEAKER_15]: It can be there if you have it up right now, because I think part of the issue was there were two separate applications.

491
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:41,189
[SPEAKER_15]: So let me just let you, if you have them handy, I'll just let you do them.

492
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:42,290
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

493
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:45,373
[SPEAKER_12]: I sent a share request.

494
00:34:45,473 --> 00:34:46,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, here we go.

495
00:34:46,554 --> 00:34:46,834
Okay.

496
00:34:48,155 --> 00:34:51,357
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, I forgot to say at the beginning, it'll be the same voting members.

497
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:52,498
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not voting.

498
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:57,982
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the plan.

499
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:01,823
[SPEAKER_11]: dated 16th.

500
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:04,305
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is our attic.

501
00:35:05,486 --> 00:35:06,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

502
00:35:06,627 --> 00:35:08,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that that does look different.

503
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:10,050
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's helpful.

504
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

505
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:15,734
[SPEAKER_12]: And so yeah, hi, Calvin.

506
00:35:15,774 --> 00:35:16,195
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

507
00:35:16,475 --> 00:35:16,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

508
00:35:19,537 --> 00:35:22,560
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you want to go into any other area of the plan?

509
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:29,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I correctly understanding it's the third floor where all the work is happening?

510
00:35:31,211 --> 00:35:34,612
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, the third floor is where all the work is happening that we need permits for.

511
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:39,214
[SPEAKER_12]: We're doing some remodeling of bedrooms and bathrooms, but that's it.

512
00:35:39,755 --> 00:35:42,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can stay zoomed in on there then.

513
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:45,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions from the board so far?

514
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:16,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Chair, yeah May yeah, just if we could Reduce what it is that the applicant is seeking the variance and the special permit I'm having a little computer issue where I can't pull up.

515
00:36:17,651 --> 00:36:26,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so essentially So that the house is existing non-conforming and I

516
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:43,722
[SPEAKER_05]: the even at two and a half floors, due to the position of the house on the lot, it was gonna require a special permit with no substantial detriment standard.

517
00:36:43,822 --> 00:36:54,390
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after the building commissioner clarified that some of the low ceiling height space on the prior

518
00:36:55,705 --> 00:37:07,114
[SPEAKER_05]: plan was still going to count and that it qualified as a third floor anyway, the applicant decided to just make that space more functional.

519
00:37:07,534 --> 00:37:17,441
[SPEAKER_05]: So in this zone, going from two and a half floor to three floor, that requires a dimensional variance.

520
00:37:17,842 --> 00:37:24,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a variance for being three floors and a special permit for extending existing nonconformity.

521
00:37:26,265 --> 00:37:29,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

522
00:37:29,568 --> 00:37:31,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Other questions from the board?

523
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:51,886
[SPEAKER_05]: So one thing I'll say, I just want to make sure we talk about it before the board deliberates.

524
00:37:53,741 --> 00:38:14,935
[SPEAKER_05]: With a variance, the board has to connect something about the shape, topography, or soil conditions of the land or structures that would present a hardship if the zoning ordinance were literally enforced.

525
00:38:16,256 --> 00:38:21,019
[SPEAKER_05]: And so here, for the variance specifically,

526
00:38:24,443 --> 00:38:36,231
[SPEAKER_05]: essentially, without the relief, you'd be limited to, I think it was about, what, like 450 foot, something like that.

527
00:38:38,913 --> 00:38:50,962
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for the variant standard, you need to connect the need for that additional half story to something about

528
00:38:51,845 --> 00:38:55,510
[SPEAKER_05]: The lot or something unusual about the lot or structure.

529
00:38:55,590 --> 00:39:01,657
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, you could point out that the shape of your lot is unusual because it's kind of at this.

530
00:39:04,127 --> 00:39:21,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Herbie Bend, which contributes to the nonconforming nature of the existing structure, or you could point to how the footprint of the existing structure limits the size of a half story that you could build up there relative to some of your neighbors.

531
00:39:21,971 --> 00:39:29,112
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have to make some argument to connect the hardship to the

532
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:31,174
[SPEAKER_05]: the structure or the lot.

533
00:39:32,154 --> 00:39:37,377
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's the hardship in this case from your perspective?

534
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,438
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm happy to answer that.

535
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:45,482
[SPEAKER_12]: The hardship is that our lot is undersized for what it was technically supposed to be allotted for.

536
00:39:46,522 --> 00:39:52,245
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't build into our yard without losing a lot of yard to gain substantial space.

537
00:39:52,406 --> 00:39:53,886
[SPEAKER_12]: Our yard's already very small.

538
00:39:54,867 --> 00:39:56,748
[SPEAKER_12]: We're also on a corner.

539
00:39:57,373 --> 00:40:00,554
[SPEAKER_12]: if you could see on our plot map.

540
00:40:00,594 --> 00:40:04,616
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't really build out because then we'd be out onto the sidewalk and that wouldn't work.

541
00:40:06,577 --> 00:40:18,942
[SPEAKER_12]: The only other place where we'd be able to build out to is our driveway, which if we do that, we lose our parking and then we would have to park on the street, which would affect flow of traffic because we're on a corner that actually gets fairly busy.

542
00:40:20,143 --> 00:40:25,385
[SPEAKER_12]: For us really to have appreciable living space that we can make our home long-term,

543
00:40:26,276 --> 00:40:32,023
[SPEAKER_12]: and we would like to stay and make our homework for us, it's to build up.

544
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:40,975
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that's why we would appreciate the relief from the zoning variants or regulations.

545
00:40:41,836 --> 00:40:42,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

546
00:40:43,017 --> 00:40:44,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Other questions from the board?

547
00:40:54,087 --> 00:41:01,991
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I'm not seeing any, so I'll go ahead and open it up to members of the public.

548
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:06,554
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a member of the public and would like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

549
00:41:06,634 --> 00:41:12,477
[SPEAKER_05]: You can raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera, raise your hand, you can type in the chat, or you can email Dennis.

550
00:41:18,984 --> 00:41:28,993
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, the board did get a letter, which is in the public record from the neighbor directly abutting, stating that they have no objection to these plans.

551
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:39,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

552
00:41:39,342 --> 00:41:42,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Lucy, can you stop screen sharing, just so it's easier to see?

553
00:41:43,927 --> 00:41:44,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

554
00:41:48,787 --> 00:41:53,809
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I'm not seeing any members of the public, any other members of the public that would like to speak on this matter.

555
00:41:55,449 --> 00:42:00,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

556
00:42:04,412 --> 00:42:04,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion.

557
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:06,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a second?

558
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:10,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

559
00:42:10,074 --> 00:42:12,335
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're going to take a roll call.

560
00:42:12,415 --> 00:42:12,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim?

561
00:42:13,356 --> 00:42:13,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

562
00:42:14,216 --> 00:42:14,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre?

563
00:42:19,558 --> 00:42:21,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I saw you say I Andre.

564
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:28,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I think your second thing dropped, but, um, Chris, I, uh, event.

565
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:29,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

566
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:30,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

567
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,173
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

568
00:42:33,233 --> 00:42:34,434
[SPEAKER_05]: You're now deliberating.

569
00:42:49,343 --> 00:42:57,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think there is hardship, and then I think that there is a legitimate reason for this build-out.

570
00:42:58,188 --> 00:43:02,530
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would tend to agree with the applicant.

571
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:07,553
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

572
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:08,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mary.

573
00:43:08,573 --> 00:43:09,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Other thoughts from the board?

574
00:43:12,388 --> 00:43:17,492
[SPEAKER_07]: would just add that it's not varying far from the original design.

575
00:43:17,552 --> 00:43:23,076
[SPEAKER_07]: It's upgrading, updating, and looks pretty similar to the surrounding area.

576
00:43:35,585 --> 00:43:39,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that due to the shape of their lot, there are limited

577
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,301
[SPEAKER_02]: what they can do for expansion or additions.

578
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:53,962
[SPEAKER_02]: So that satisfies my, I'm satisfied, I should say, I guess, with that criteria.

579
00:43:56,163 --> 00:43:56,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

580
00:43:57,223 --> 00:43:57,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Other thoughts?

581
00:43:58,623 --> 00:44:02,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with my colleagues as well.

582
00:44:05,504 --> 00:44:07,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just chiming in to say I concur.

583
00:44:07,725 --> 00:44:10,025
[SPEAKER_05]: The lot's certainly unusually shaped.

584
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:20,607
[SPEAKER_05]: And given the footprint of the structure and its position on the lot, there's not a lot of other options to extend the house.

585
00:44:20,767 --> 00:44:28,309
[SPEAKER_05]: So in this case, I see the hardship and I also don't see a substantial detriment.

586
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:34,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly comforting to know that the immediate abutters don't object to the plans.

587
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:38,371
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

588
00:44:38,431 --> 00:44:38,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Well,

589
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:44,434
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's nothing else from the board, Chair awaits a motion.

590
00:44:44,514 --> 00:44:56,123
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to have to weigh in both on the special permit for extending existing nonconformity and then the variance with respect to the number of floors.

591
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:22,571
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, if someone wants to make a motion to approve the variance for number of floors and approve the special permit, that would grant the applicant the relief they're seeking.

592
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:25,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?

593
00:45:26,913 --> 00:45:27,774
[SPEAKER_05]: We can hear you now, yes.

594
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:29,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

595
00:45:30,415 --> 00:45:31,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we do two separate motions?

596
00:45:33,757 --> 00:45:34,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Up to you.

597
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:46,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'd like to approve the variance for the third floor for the Myrtle Street project as well as the special permit.

598
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:48,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a second?

599
00:45:48,993 --> 00:45:50,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll second.

600
00:45:50,473 --> 00:45:53,534
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's take a roll call.

601
00:45:53,554 --> 00:45:53,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Yvette?

602
00:45:55,055 --> 00:45:55,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

603
00:45:55,835 --> 00:45:56,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary?

604
00:45:56,976 --> 00:45:57,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

605
00:45:57,956 --> 00:45:58,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris?

606
00:45:58,976 --> 00:45:59,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

607
00:45:59,977 --> 00:46:00,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre?

608
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:00,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

609
00:46:04,788 --> 00:46:04,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

610
00:46:06,049 --> 00:46:06,469
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jim?

611
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:07,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

612
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:09,071
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

613
00:46:09,091 --> 00:46:09,931
[SPEAKER_05]: You have your variance.

614
00:46:09,971 --> 00:46:10,832
[SPEAKER_05]: You have your special permit.

615
00:46:12,553 --> 00:46:14,034
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, thank you so much.

616
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:14,995
[SPEAKER_12]: Best news ever.

617
00:46:15,175 --> 00:46:15,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

618
00:46:15,555 --> 00:46:26,863
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, and Lucy, I know I've said this already twice, but I'll say it again just because, just to, so what happens is I'll write up the decision and it'll get checked by our legal counsel.

619
00:46:27,483 --> 00:46:31,065
[SPEAKER_15]: And then once it's okay by them, it gets signed by the members of the board members.

620
00:46:31,566 --> 00:46:33,227
[SPEAKER_15]: At that point, it gets filed in the clerk's office.

621
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:39,453
[SPEAKER_15]: That point there's a 20 day waiting period for an appeal in case an appeal comes in and we can't get anything for them.

622
00:46:39,813 --> 00:46:51,439
[SPEAKER_15]: When the appeals period is over, go down to the clerk's office, you'll get a letter from them, take that to the Middlesex Registry and you just file that and then you can come right back and get your permit that day.

623
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,921
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, sounds good.

624
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:56,982
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you have any questions, yeah, yeah.

625
00:46:57,162 --> 00:46:59,423
[SPEAKER_15]: When you're going through this, just don't hesitate to stop by.

626
00:46:59,463 --> 00:47:00,983
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll help you through the process.

627
00:47:01,243 --> 00:47:08,486
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll try to remember all that, but yeah, it sounds like there's about a 20 days at fastest and then there's filings and all that, but yeah, we'll be in touch.

628
00:47:08,946 --> 00:47:09,947
[SPEAKER_12]: No, this is wonderful news.

629
00:47:10,007 --> 00:47:10,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so, so much.

630
00:47:11,367 --> 00:47:12,167
[SPEAKER_12]: I really appreciate it.

631
00:47:12,507 --> 00:47:12,888
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

632
00:47:13,128 --> 00:47:13,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

633
00:47:13,328 --> 00:47:14,288
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

634
00:47:15,008 --> 00:47:15,369
[SPEAKER_01]: What's next?

635
00:47:24,186 --> 00:47:25,647
[SPEAKER_15]: 357 Riverside Avenue.

636
00:47:26,248 --> 00:47:34,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Applicant and owner David Beaman to install a new curb cut and driveway in the front yard of the property, which is not allowed for the City of Medford zoning ordinance.

637
00:47:34,374 --> 00:47:37,496
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I see we have David Beaman on the call.

638
00:47:37,857 --> 00:47:38,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello and welcome.

639
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:41,740
[SPEAKER_05]: You're on mute.

640
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:47,144
[SPEAKER_04]: You're still on mute.

641
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:54,587
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

642
00:47:54,768 --> 00:47:55,808
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, I'm Dave.

643
00:47:55,988 --> 00:48:00,072
[SPEAKER_17]: I, uh, we have no parking at our house.

644
00:48:00,432 --> 00:48:04,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, I can show you a photo if you want, or yeah, that'd be great.

645
00:48:05,436 --> 00:48:06,697
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

646
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:07,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Same day.

647
00:48:07,077 --> 00:48:11,301
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll just give you a verbal and you're all set now.

648
00:48:12,692 --> 00:48:12,972
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

649
00:48:14,033 --> 00:48:14,173
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

650
00:48:14,253 --> 00:48:15,533
[SPEAKER_17]: What do I just scan it in?

651
00:48:16,133 --> 00:48:25,017
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, uh, you just, if you have, if you have the photo up on your screen, you can hit share and then images will pop up and you can just share that photo.

652
00:48:25,577 --> 00:48:31,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Or if you want, if I can call up and what I'll call it now is the, uh, yep.

653
00:48:31,819 --> 00:48:32,099
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

654
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:35,561
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you do, uh, on the bottom, there's a little green button says share and.

655
00:48:43,372 --> 00:48:45,113
[SPEAKER_17]: Where's the button again?

656
00:48:45,353 --> 00:48:46,293
[SPEAKER_15]: It's at the bottom of this.

657
00:48:46,613 --> 00:48:49,514
[SPEAKER_15]: It's on the bottom of along the, uh, tools.

658
00:48:49,534 --> 00:48:50,955
[SPEAKER_15]: There's it's a button that says share.

659
00:48:51,015 --> 00:48:51,595
[SPEAKER_15]: You should have it.

660
00:48:55,997 --> 00:48:56,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

661
00:48:56,957 --> 00:49:02,139
[SPEAKER_05]: On mine, it shows up as a green rectangle with an up arrow.

662
00:49:06,521 --> 00:49:08,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, it's over there.

663
00:49:08,522 --> 00:49:08,802
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

664
00:49:08,822 --> 00:49:09,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

665
00:49:11,343 --> 00:49:11,603
[SPEAKER_17]: Oops.

666
00:49:13,914 --> 00:49:15,515
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, who do I share it to, though?

667
00:49:16,055 --> 00:49:17,796
[SPEAKER_14]: If you just hit share, it should share it to everybody.

668
00:49:18,737 --> 00:49:21,078
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, but the share button's on the Zoom.

669
00:49:24,881 --> 00:49:33,026
[SPEAKER_14]: The other thing I could do is if I could just call up on Street View and sort of show it that way, they might give a... I think that'll work.

670
00:49:34,008 --> 00:49:34,548
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

671
00:49:34,648 --> 00:49:34,969
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

672
00:49:35,049 --> 00:49:35,509
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

673
00:49:35,629 --> 00:49:38,030
[SPEAKER_17]: I had a picture of my car parked in front.

674
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:44,013
[SPEAKER_17]: So you can kind of see the problem, but, uh, yeah, I don't see a share button anymore.

675
00:49:45,494 --> 00:49:47,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me, uh, no worries.

676
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:49,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Dennis will bring it up on street view.

677
00:49:49,916 --> 00:49:50,196
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

678
00:49:51,117 --> 00:49:53,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you have to bring the mouse all the way down.

679
00:49:56,019 --> 00:49:57,260
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, now I see the share button.

680
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:57,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

681
00:49:58,881 --> 00:49:59,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel free to give it a try.

682
00:49:59,821 --> 00:50:03,023
[SPEAKER_17]: What popped up when, once I got rid of the photo, that's, that's weird.

683
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:05,370
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, share first.

684
00:50:16,534 --> 00:50:16,854
[SPEAKER_17]: See it?

685
00:50:17,794 --> 00:50:18,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we see it.

686
00:50:19,295 --> 00:50:19,575
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

687
00:50:21,035 --> 00:50:24,657
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, so there's what we're doing to unload

688
00:50:27,058 --> 00:50:29,039
[SPEAKER_17]: groceries and supplies.

689
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,862
[SPEAKER_17]: And as you can see, there's plenty of room in front of the house for a parking spot.

690
00:50:35,063 --> 00:50:39,366
[SPEAKER_17]: There is no room on either side of the house for a driveway.

691
00:50:39,986 --> 00:50:53,635
[SPEAKER_17]: So my plan is to tear down the front porch, put the stairs going sideways to traverse the front of the house, and then put pavers

692
00:50:55,238 --> 00:51:01,240
[SPEAKER_17]: semi-permeable or permeable pavers in front of the house.

693
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,580
[SPEAKER_17]: So I have a place where I can parallel park.

694
00:51:04,941 --> 00:51:12,283
[SPEAKER_17]: And right now it's a real problem, as you can see with, you know, safety and that's our main concern.

695
00:51:15,464 --> 00:51:15,784
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

696
00:51:16,804 --> 00:51:17,644
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll get rid of that.

697
00:51:18,044 --> 00:51:18,404
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

698
00:51:18,885 --> 00:51:23,006
[SPEAKER_05]: We've, by the way, I forgot to say that's the same coding members.

699
00:51:24,295 --> 00:51:26,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have questions from members of the board?

700
00:51:30,518 --> 00:51:32,619
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess I should say I'm looking for a variance.

701
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's right.

702
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:40,783
[SPEAKER_05]: So the proposed parking is in the front yard setback.

703
00:51:43,624 --> 00:51:46,686
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's not allowed under the ordinance.

704
00:51:46,746 --> 00:51:49,267
[SPEAKER_05]: So a variance is required to put it there.

705
00:51:50,132 --> 00:51:54,554
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I need a variance of about four feet apparently.

706
00:51:56,235 --> 00:52:01,557
[SPEAKER_17]: The front yard's currently set back 15 feet minus the front porch.

707
00:52:02,978 --> 00:52:13,983
[SPEAKER_17]: The new porch is gonna be four feet wide, allowing for a nine foot wide parking spot parallel to the street with a 16 foot curb cut.

708
00:52:16,565 --> 00:52:17,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Questions from the board.

709
00:52:20,877 --> 00:52:24,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have a picture of the plan over the proposed plan?

710
00:52:24,999 --> 00:52:28,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is the proposed plan to remove part of the sidewalk?

711
00:52:31,242 --> 00:52:33,823
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, well, the variance is for a curb cut.

712
00:52:37,465 --> 00:52:38,465
[SPEAKER_17]: Here, I'll show you that.

713
00:52:38,866 --> 00:52:39,326
[SPEAKER_15]: I can do that.

714
00:52:39,386 --> 00:52:40,186
[SPEAKER_15]: I got that right now.

715
00:52:40,626 --> 00:52:41,407
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, thanks.

716
00:52:41,687 --> 00:52:42,627
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, there it is.

717
00:52:44,348 --> 00:52:45,889
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, didn't get too much.

718
00:52:56,701 --> 00:53:01,204
[SPEAKER_08]: So this was the sidewalk that we saw in the picture?

719
00:53:01,644 --> 00:53:02,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's right.

720
00:53:02,525 --> 00:53:03,986
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a sidewalk right here.

721
00:53:04,006 --> 00:53:04,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Right here.

722
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:05,326
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a sidewalk.

723
00:53:05,466 --> 00:53:05,827
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

724
00:53:06,047 --> 00:53:06,247
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

725
00:53:07,728 --> 00:53:08,848
[SPEAKER_17]: Or right here, actually.

726
00:53:09,649 --> 00:53:10,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

727
00:53:10,689 --> 00:53:13,091
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was the yard?

728
00:53:13,351 --> 00:53:16,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to look at the picture.

729
00:53:16,853 --> 00:53:20,055
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the yard right here where you see the car parked?

730
00:53:23,894 --> 00:53:26,235
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see that in the photo.

731
00:53:27,335 --> 00:53:29,056
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at the photo on my phone.

732
00:53:29,556 --> 00:53:31,737
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that's because there is no yard, really.

733
00:53:31,777 --> 00:53:34,757
[SPEAKER_17]: There's just front steps going down to the sidewalk.

734
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:49,262
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to remove those steps and have a stairway going down the front of the house, parallel to the house, not coming directly at you.

735
00:53:50,523 --> 00:53:51,403
[SPEAKER_17]: And a smaller,

736
00:53:53,448 --> 00:53:57,370
[SPEAKER_17]: a smaller porch around four by six.

737
00:54:00,252 --> 00:54:06,375
[SPEAKER_17]: These are just preliminary plans for the variance.

738
00:54:07,076 --> 00:54:13,239
[SPEAKER_17]: I can submit other plans for how the house is going to look later on if I get the variance.

739
00:54:15,707 --> 00:54:20,150
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the porch, right, from looking at the picture.

740
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:25,914
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the porch, and this looks like a fence.

741
00:54:25,974 --> 00:54:28,036
[SPEAKER_17]: This will be the top of the porch right here.

742
00:54:29,677 --> 00:54:30,737
[SPEAKER_17]: See this little square?

743
00:54:30,757 --> 00:54:31,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

744
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:34,480
[SPEAKER_17]: These are the steps going down.

745
00:54:35,901 --> 00:54:40,524
[SPEAKER_17]: This will be all pavers made to look nice.

746
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,721
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I'm going to have granite installed around the edges.

747
00:54:52,223 --> 00:54:56,144
[SPEAKER_08]: So the car will be parallel to the front steps, right?

748
00:54:56,384 --> 00:54:57,204
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the car.

749
00:54:57,604 --> 00:54:58,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

750
00:54:58,184 --> 00:54:59,504
[SPEAKER_08]: So this will be the parking lot.

751
00:54:59,524 --> 00:55:00,405
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the car, yeah.

752
00:55:00,825 --> 00:55:07,746
[SPEAKER_08]: And this will be the entrance will be... And the entrance is right... This is the river.

753
00:55:08,106 --> 00:55:09,947
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the entrance to the house right here.

754
00:55:11,486 --> 00:55:12,888
[SPEAKER_17]: You see my arrow?

755
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:17,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I don't see that in the picture.

756
00:55:17,933 --> 00:55:18,974
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just trying to figure out.

757
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:21,917
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that's because I'm going to take the porch down.

758
00:55:21,957 --> 00:55:24,320
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to remove it in the picture.

759
00:55:26,642 --> 00:55:32,208
[SPEAKER_17]: The way it is now, I'm taking that porch down to allow room for the car.

760
00:55:34,557 --> 00:55:36,018
[SPEAKER_17]: and put a smaller porch.

761
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,059
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're taking the stairs out.

762
00:55:38,219 --> 00:55:44,521
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, so this is Riverside.

763
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,762
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, this is Riverside here.

764
00:55:46,902 --> 00:55:54,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and then this is the cut to the... That's my side yard right there.

765
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:56,287
[SPEAKER_17]: And here's the other side yard.

766
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:01,329
[SPEAKER_17]: It's about three feet on either side.

767
00:56:02,049 --> 00:56:03,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so Mary, in the picture,

768
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:11,665
[SPEAKER_05]: there's the car, it's partially on the sidewalk, which now the curb cut in that position.

769
00:56:12,405 --> 00:56:19,710
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in the plot plan, there was kind of a faint outline of a staircase.

770
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:29,596
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was some landscaping and a staircase and that all gets removed to make room for the car.

771
00:56:30,657 --> 00:56:30,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

772
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:31,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

773
00:56:31,417 --> 00:56:31,818
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

774
00:56:31,898 --> 00:56:32,238
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

775
00:56:32,258 --> 00:56:32,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

776
00:56:34,762 --> 00:56:47,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I correctly understanding the reason for the size of the curb cut is because it's parallel to the house, so if it was a smaller curb cut, it just wouldn't be practical to get in and out?

777
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:51,216
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's for ease of coming in and out of the traffic.

778
00:56:52,657 --> 00:57:00,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Originally, I wanted to make it 20 feet, but the building inspector revised that to 16, so there would be

779
00:57:02,102 --> 00:57:05,185
[SPEAKER_17]: point of view, better viewing coming in and out.

780
00:57:07,287 --> 00:57:13,512
[SPEAKER_17]: Apparently, you know, there's, you must have done some, some work on that.

781
00:57:15,821 --> 00:57:17,481
[SPEAKER_17]: To figure it out, but.

782
00:57:18,582 --> 00:57:18,842
[SPEAKER_17]: That.

783
00:57:20,342 --> 00:57:22,783
[SPEAKER_17]: Unfortunately, I have to take down those.

784
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:26,984
[SPEAKER_17]: Those grapevines, but it's going to have to be done.

785
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:29,044
[SPEAKER_17]: It's it's really for us.

786
00:57:29,124 --> 00:57:32,465
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, we're we're both over 70 years of age and we.

787
00:57:34,265 --> 00:57:36,926
[SPEAKER_17]: We're we're doing this for convenience and safety.

788
00:57:38,006 --> 00:57:40,167
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it benefits both us and.

789
00:57:40,567 --> 00:57:40,687
[SPEAKER_17]: And.

790
00:57:42,678 --> 00:57:47,121
[SPEAKER_17]: and cars going by and pedestrians going down the sidewalk.

791
00:57:48,321 --> 00:57:53,865
[SPEAKER_17]: Because as you can see, we're unloading groceries several times a week.

792
00:57:56,986 --> 00:57:59,648
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, that's my plea.

793
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:02,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

794
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:04,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Other questions?

795
00:58:07,513 --> 00:58:10,254
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't actually physically fit two cars though, right?

796
00:58:10,274 --> 00:58:11,115
[SPEAKER_07]: You can only do the one.

797
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:13,079
[SPEAKER_17]: It would only be one.

798
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:18,481
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we only have one car anyway, but yeah.

799
00:58:18,501 --> 00:58:21,343
[SPEAKER_17]: It would be structured in such a way that you couldn't really.

800
00:58:22,723 --> 00:58:25,764
[SPEAKER_17]: Go up vertically, you'd have to go parallel.

801
00:58:26,845 --> 00:58:30,846
[SPEAKER_17]: And the idea is to drive in and then back back up.

802
00:58:32,187 --> 00:58:35,348
[SPEAKER_17]: The whole front yard is going to be paved, so with pavers.

803
00:58:36,749 --> 00:58:38,889
[SPEAKER_17]: It would be a lot better looking than what's there now.

804
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:40,410
[SPEAKER_17]: I assure you.

805
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:52,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Beeman, do you anticipate being able to screen the car a little bit when it's parked so that it's not just right next to the sidewalk?

806
00:58:53,522 --> 00:58:55,623
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

807
00:58:57,865 --> 00:59:04,030
[SPEAKER_17]: There's going to be a nine-foot space and the car is only approximately seven foot wide.

808
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:16,604
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, will you still have a fence screening part of the car when it's parked?

809
00:59:18,605 --> 00:59:22,447
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that would be a nice fun.

810
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:28,070
[SPEAKER_17]: I would do that if I could, because it'd be nice to hide the car.

811
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:29,531
[SPEAKER_17]: We could plant.

812
00:59:33,299 --> 00:59:39,044
[SPEAKER_17]: The only problem with doing something like that is that it would obscure the view coming in and out.

813
00:59:39,064 --> 00:59:40,145
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the only problem.

814
00:59:40,225 --> 00:59:58,182
[SPEAKER_17]: So now we don't have any plans of building any structures on other than along the sides is going to be some granite work done to allow access to the backyard.

815
01:00:08,128 --> 01:00:09,968
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, other questions from the board?

816
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:20,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Being done, I will open it up to public comment.

817
01:00:20,811 --> 01:00:24,292
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a member of the public and would like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

818
01:00:24,312 --> 01:00:28,053
[SPEAKER_05]: You can raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera and raise your hand.

819
01:00:28,073 --> 01:00:29,513
[SPEAKER_05]: You can type in the chat or you can email.

820
01:00:43,657 --> 01:00:46,699
[SPEAKER_05]: not seeing any members of the public who would like to speak on this matter.

821
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:52,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so Chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

822
01:00:54,184 --> 01:00:54,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I moved.

823
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:55,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, second.

824
01:00:57,907 --> 01:00:58,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

825
01:00:59,068 --> 01:00:59,248
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

826
01:00:59,268 --> 01:01:00,689
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a roll call.

827
01:01:00,769 --> 01:01:01,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim?

828
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:02,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

829
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:03,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre?

830
01:01:03,151 --> 01:01:05,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris?

831
01:01:06,293 --> 01:01:06,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

832
01:01:07,153 --> 01:01:07,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary?

833
01:01:07,614 --> 01:01:08,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

834
01:01:08,454 --> 01:01:09,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Yvette?

835
01:01:10,636 --> 01:01:10,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

836
01:01:11,727 --> 01:01:12,927
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're now deliberating.

837
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,887
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think, folks?

838
01:01:21,709 --> 01:01:27,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think if I could go first, Mr. Chair.

839
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:36,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I have concerns in that there are a lot of fairly decent sidewalk traffic here.

840
01:01:37,812 --> 01:01:40,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Ironically, placing the,

841
01:01:41,923 --> 01:01:56,190
[SPEAKER_02]: driveway or the car parallel to the road may actually be safer than perpendicular to the road, because the driver would have a clearer view of pedestrians.

842
01:01:56,310 --> 01:02:03,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And pedestrians may or may not have a clearer view of the car coming in and out.

843
01:02:04,534 --> 01:02:05,455
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think they would.

844
01:02:07,236 --> 01:02:11,158
[SPEAKER_02]: So we already have many, if not

845
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:31,321
[SPEAKER_02]: least a dozen, maybe more parking spaces that are perpendicular and cause some problems with school children walking across the backs of cars that are backing out and anyone else for that matter.

846
01:02:32,142 --> 01:02:41,109
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so it's kind of ironic, but I think the parallel parking in the front is actually an improvement on that.

847
01:02:42,082 --> 01:02:42,342
[SPEAKER_02]: point.

848
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:47,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chris.

849
01:02:47,368 --> 01:02:48,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Other thoughts from the board?

850
01:02:52,854 --> 01:02:53,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Andre, go ahead.

851
01:02:58,333 --> 01:03:04,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'll just, I'll say that I always hate to put parking in the front yard.

852
01:03:05,819 --> 01:03:11,544
[SPEAKER_03]: This property has absolutely no other place to put it.

853
01:03:13,545 --> 01:03:18,626
[SPEAKER_03]: No possibility of putting a car anywhere else.

854
01:03:19,527 --> 01:03:21,707
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a very busy street.

855
01:03:21,767 --> 01:03:24,148
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no on street parking option.

856
01:03:24,648 --> 01:03:30,810
[SPEAKER_03]: And even around the corner on the side streets, there's almost no on street parking option.

857
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:31,390
[SPEAKER_03]: So

858
01:03:33,045 --> 01:03:46,963
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, despite serious reservations, I would be inclined to make an exception so that, you know, this family can stay in their home.

859
01:03:50,406 --> 01:03:57,652
[SPEAKER_03]: but I wish there was enough, there's not even enough room in the front to really even screen the car, which is disappointing.

860
01:03:58,052 --> 01:04:02,856
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess one other question I have, if it's okay to ask Mr. Beam in this.

861
01:04:03,296 --> 01:04:07,680
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is in the front yard, there's two steps up to the front yard.

862
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,764
[SPEAKER_03]: So are you taking out the retaining wall and regrading it to the level of the sidewalk?

863
01:04:14,005 --> 01:04:19,990
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be graded to the appropriate slope, but it's going to be graded all the way up to the house, yeah.

864
01:04:23,912 --> 01:04:29,897
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be sloped at, I'm not sure what the angle is, but there's for drainage purposes.

865
01:04:29,917 --> 01:04:35,863
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.

866
01:04:35,883 --> 01:04:40,827
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, other thoughts from the board.

867
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:56,642
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to add that I think it's always good when folks are trying to stay in their homes.

868
01:04:56,702 --> 01:04:58,542
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is like a quality of life.

869
01:04:58,582 --> 01:05:06,665
[SPEAKER_07]: So in addition to it not being detrimental to the neighborhood, because it's not as if they're taking away parking, there's no parking on that street anyway.

870
01:05:08,406 --> 01:05:17,369
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's adding value, if anything, to his home, which I think only helps the neighborhood as a whole.

871
01:05:18,792 --> 01:05:21,836
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the way it is, and that's in that neighborhood.

872
01:05:22,396 --> 01:05:27,421
[SPEAKER_07]: It's tight, and we have to figure it out the best way possible to live.

873
01:05:27,501 --> 01:05:31,986
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it makes sense to put a parking spot in that way there.

874
01:05:35,069 --> 01:05:35,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for that.

875
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:37,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Other thoughts from the board?

876
01:05:40,786 --> 01:05:44,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Chair, if I could follow up on what Andre just mentioned.

877
01:05:46,069 --> 01:05:55,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess now thinking about it, if the slope is too severe, there'll be a problem with the car slipping in snow or something like that.

878
01:05:55,455 --> 01:06:09,523
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to see the building inspector, I don't know if we can condition this, but to make sure that the slope is appropriate for being so close to the sidewalk.

879
01:06:11,157 --> 01:06:16,940
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can't condition on some downstream approval.

880
01:06:18,961 --> 01:06:29,568
[SPEAKER_05]: If it triggers something in the building code, then it wouldn't be permittable anyway.

881
01:06:29,588 --> 01:06:32,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Dennis, is this something you can speak to?

882
01:06:32,949 --> 01:06:36,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so all curb cuts are approved by the city engineer.

883
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:39,353
[SPEAKER_15]: So the city engineer would have to go over these plans and approve them.

884
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:52,571
[SPEAKER_15]: I have confidence that anything in issues with drainage, I think the other thing is that Mr. Beaman mentioned that they're putting permeable pavers in, which actually will help prevent some of overflow of water.

885
01:06:52,611 --> 01:06:58,455
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what we're always trying to ask folks to put permeable things in in situations like this, which

886
01:06:59,075 --> 01:07:03,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully also sort of minimize the water going into the streets.

887
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:12,126
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to try to keep rainwater from going on the street, but I think between the city engineer review of the of the driveway of the curb cut.

888
01:07:12,787 --> 01:07:15,569
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, he's not usually in these situations.

889
01:07:15,589 --> 01:07:16,790
[SPEAKER_15]: He's not just going to look at the curb cut.

890
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:18,011
[SPEAKER_15]: He's going to look at this.

891
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:24,863
[SPEAKER_15]: Permit has to go through his office anyway, so not just for the curb cut, but the actual.

892
01:07:24,883 --> 01:07:28,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Pretty much all types of these works will get approved by the city engineer.

893
01:07:28,805 --> 01:07:30,146
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think between that and.

894
01:07:31,887 --> 01:07:39,472
[SPEAKER_17]: If I may say something, I'm hiring a general contractor to do the work, so he'll make sure that all of the.

895
01:07:40,493 --> 01:07:43,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Appropriate building codes are up to code and.

896
01:07:45,656 --> 01:07:48,118
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to look nice too, I guarantee you.

897
01:07:48,399 --> 01:07:49,820
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to spend money on this.

898
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:55,384
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to just pave it like you see elsewhere on Riverside Avenue.

899
01:07:55,464 --> 01:07:56,865
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to make it look nice.

900
01:07:57,686 --> 01:08:01,149
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got a hip roof idea for the porch.

901
01:08:01,229 --> 01:08:03,210
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's going to look really beautiful.

902
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:09,475
[SPEAKER_17]: It'll actually add to the ambience of Medford Park.

903
01:08:11,229 --> 01:08:14,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Mr. Chair, just to conclude my thought on that.

904
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:21,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have confidence in the city staff to do that.

905
01:08:21,692 --> 01:08:32,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I was speaking not to the sidewalk or the curb cut, but the actual property that we're, the property bounds that we're discussing.

906
01:08:34,834 --> 01:08:41,317
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, I guess that that would also apply any runoff and so forth onto the sidewalk.

907
01:08:42,998 --> 01:08:43,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

908
01:08:47,981 --> 01:08:48,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

909
01:08:48,761 --> 01:09:04,409
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not voting, but I'll just chime in to say, yeah, when I first saw the plans, I didn't love them, but this certainly is an unusual lot for the neighborhood, like all of the other

910
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:21,143
[SPEAKER_05]: houses seem to have driveways either because they have a wider lot with enough space for one or they happen to be on a side street when they have a driveway on the side street.

911
01:09:21,263 --> 01:09:24,764
[SPEAKER_05]: So this one, there really is no other option.

912
01:09:24,824 --> 01:09:29,585
[SPEAKER_05]: It's either a space here or none at all.

913
01:09:30,505 --> 01:09:34,846
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not immediately clear to me what the strategy has been up until this point, not that

914
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:42,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to know, but certainly it does seem like the shape of the lot presents a hardship in this case.

915
01:09:42,315 --> 01:09:46,958
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

916
01:09:47,778 --> 01:09:53,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair awaits a motion on the variance for parking in the front yard.

917
01:09:54,923 --> 01:09:57,784
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the, I guess it's an oversized curb cut as well.

918
01:09:57,885 --> 01:09:58,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right, Dennis?

919
01:10:01,115 --> 01:10:08,642
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, no, curb cut widths are 20 feet in residential zones.

920
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:12,585
[SPEAKER_15]: So single family one, single family two, and general residence.

921
01:10:12,806 --> 01:10:14,307
[SPEAKER_15]: And so they're 20 feet.

922
01:10:15,508 --> 01:10:19,852
[SPEAKER_05]: So just for parking in the front yard, carry weight to motion on the variance request.

923
01:10:22,878 --> 01:10:34,888
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Mr. Chair, I have a question if this board's approval will be subject to the city engineers and the building commissioner, right, for this project?

924
01:10:35,409 --> 01:10:49,341
[SPEAKER_05]: We technically know from a legal standpoint, so there's no downstream approval that our variance is contingent upon, but this plan to fully execute upon it does require

925
01:10:50,581 --> 01:10:53,323
[SPEAKER_05]: a permit from the city engineer, if that's what you're asking.

926
01:10:55,003 --> 01:10:55,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, great.

927
01:10:55,684 --> 01:11:04,168
[SPEAKER_05]: The variance for the parking in the front yard, that one, the city engineer doesn't have any say in where the buck stops here, so to speak.

928
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:10,851
[SPEAKER_08]: And what about the curb cut?

929
01:11:10,911 --> 01:11:12,792
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what the city engineers?

930
01:11:13,233 --> 01:11:14,953
[SPEAKER_05]: The city engineer has to approve that.

931
01:11:15,014 --> 01:11:17,655
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not, our variance

932
01:11:18,385 --> 01:11:21,267
[SPEAKER_05]: vote here is not with respect to the curb cut.

933
01:11:21,327 --> 01:11:38,576
[SPEAKER_05]: So if something about that curb cut that doesn't meet the city's standards and expectation, then the city engineer is still, he may not allow it.

934
01:11:38,596 --> 01:11:40,457
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just voting on the parking in the front yard.

935
01:11:41,438 --> 01:11:41,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

936
01:11:41,918 --> 01:11:42,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

937
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:44,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

938
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:49,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Keeping that in mind, Chair awaits a motion on the variance application.

939
01:11:57,828 --> 01:11:58,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't hear you.

940
01:11:58,908 --> 01:12:00,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me now?

941
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:01,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

942
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:02,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

943
01:12:02,271 --> 01:12:08,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve the variance for 357 Riverside Ave for the front yard parking.

944
01:12:09,195 --> 01:12:12,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way that it is written, it does say curb cut in the application.

945
01:12:12,517 --> 01:12:14,218
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to say that as well.

946
01:12:14,679 --> 01:12:14,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

947
01:12:15,691 --> 01:12:16,231
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a second?

948
01:12:16,812 --> 01:12:17,352
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll second.

949
01:12:17,892 --> 01:12:19,433
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a roll call.

950
01:12:19,834 --> 01:12:20,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary?

951
01:12:20,334 --> 01:12:21,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

952
01:12:21,855 --> 01:12:22,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Yvette?

953
01:12:23,396 --> 01:12:23,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

954
01:12:24,036 --> 01:12:24,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris?

955
01:12:27,078 --> 01:12:29,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

956
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:30,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim?

957
01:12:31,361 --> 01:12:31,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

958
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:32,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre?

959
01:12:34,763 --> 01:12:35,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

960
01:12:35,103 --> 01:12:38,365
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, variance is approved.

961
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,700
[SPEAKER_05]: So the variance is approved.

962
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:45,761
[SPEAKER_05]: You have your parking.

963
01:12:47,382 --> 01:12:51,023
[SPEAKER_15]: And Dave, just to reiterate what I sort of said earlier, I'll write up the decision.

964
01:12:51,043 --> 01:12:57,225
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll get approved, checked by our legal counsel, get signed, and then it gets filed in the clerk's office.

965
01:12:57,745 --> 01:13:06,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Once 20 days has passed after it's been in the clerk's office with no appeal, then you just come in, get the letter from them, go to the registry, and

966
01:13:06,567 --> 01:13:07,428
[SPEAKER_15]: they can get your permit.

967
01:13:07,468 --> 01:13:09,229
[SPEAKER_15]: But I can talk you through that.

968
01:13:09,249 --> 01:13:12,290
[SPEAKER_15]: When you come in, if you have any questions, just give me a call.

969
01:13:12,351 --> 01:13:15,813
[SPEAKER_15]: I can help you out with that process when we get to that point.

970
01:13:16,513 --> 01:13:22,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so you'll let me know when it's... I'll let you know when it's filed, and then that'll start the 20-day clock.

971
01:13:22,737 --> 01:13:28,300
[SPEAKER_15]: And then once those 20 days are over, then you can come on in and I can help you out and show you to the clerk's office and get you the paperwork.

972
01:13:29,453 --> 01:13:35,321
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, can I deal with my contractor yet or should I hold off?

973
01:13:36,163 --> 01:13:42,432
[SPEAKER_15]: You probably can't get the permit until then, so I would, I mean, if part of the work actually.

974
01:13:44,223 --> 01:13:45,523
[SPEAKER_15]: He's going to file.

975
01:13:45,984 --> 01:13:47,384
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, he's going to file this when we get the approval.

976
01:13:47,404 --> 01:13:52,325
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm thinking something like the porch removal and the adding of the stairs has nothing to do with our permit.

977
01:13:52,925 --> 01:13:56,026
[SPEAKER_15]: So that, I think, can probably get started beforehand.

978
01:13:56,286 --> 01:13:57,627
[SPEAKER_15]: But it all depends if you file.

979
01:13:57,647 --> 01:13:59,287
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are probably going to be separate permits.

980
01:13:59,327 --> 01:14:02,408
[SPEAKER_15]: But have them talk to the building department and sort of see what they can do.

981
01:14:02,468 --> 01:14:08,850
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think they can probably do some of the work initially just to sort of get things started, if that's easier.

982
01:14:09,490 --> 01:14:09,730
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

983
01:14:11,651 --> 01:14:11,971
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

984
01:14:12,011 --> 01:14:12,511
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks, guys.

985
01:14:13,563 --> 01:14:14,824
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, thank you, good night.

986
01:14:14,844 --> 01:14:17,727
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, what's next, Dennis?

987
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,169
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, 54 Murray Street.

988
01:14:20,469 --> 01:14:30,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Applicant and owner, Leanne Morgan, to install in addition to 54 Murray Street, creating a side yard setback and extending existing front yard setback nonconformity, which is not allowed per the City of Medford zoning ordinance.

989
01:14:31,318 --> 01:14:35,142
[SPEAKER_15]: This will also add a parking space in the front yard, which is not allowed per the City of Medford zoning ordinance.

990
01:14:35,162 --> 01:14:38,965
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thank you, and I see we have Leanne Morgan here.

991
01:14:39,566 --> 01:14:39,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.

992
01:14:41,588 --> 01:14:43,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and good evening, folks.

993
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Could I get my camera reinstated?

994
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:46,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry about that.

995
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:47,132
[SPEAKER_00]: No worries.

996
01:14:51,956 --> 01:14:52,776
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everybody.

997
01:14:52,796 --> 01:14:55,739
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Eric Mayer, counsel for Ms.

998
01:14:55,779 --> 01:14:58,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan, so I'm going to be here to present on the application here.

999
01:14:59,762 --> 01:15:08,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time on what is a very nice evening after a very hot week to talk about this variance application.

1000
01:15:09,884 --> 01:15:14,107
[SPEAKER_00]: So the purpose of this variance application is really twofold.

1001
01:15:14,127 --> 01:15:16,549
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two interrelated aspects to it.

1002
01:15:17,329 --> 01:15:29,098
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is to build a modest 10 by 24 foot addition to the northerly side of the pre-existing non-conforming residence on the property.

1003
01:15:31,423 --> 01:15:42,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Additional aspect of this variance application is to place an additional off street parking space directly in front of where that 10 by 24 foot addition would be located.

1004
01:15:44,355 --> 01:15:53,259
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, the property has a preexisting nonconforming structure because it is located within the 15 foot front setback.

1005
01:15:53,939 --> 01:16:05,225
[SPEAKER_00]: The 10 by 24 foot addition would on the backside encroach slightly by about 0.7 feet within the side setback.

1006
01:16:05,785 --> 01:16:12,308
[SPEAKER_00]: And naturally the addition of the parking space would place some parking in the front setback as well.

1007
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:17,293
[SPEAKER_00]: The property is somewhat unique compared to the rest of the neighborhood.

1008
01:16:17,533 --> 01:16:20,035
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the SF2 zoning district.

1009
01:16:20,675 --> 01:16:28,721
[SPEAKER_00]: It has 10,776 square feet, and it might be easier to go through this if you could bring up the plot plan.

1010
01:16:29,201 --> 01:16:30,902
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I could bring it up on share screen.

1011
01:16:31,623 --> 01:16:33,924
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do that.

1012
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:36,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it be easier for you to have the share screen or do you just want to bring it up?

1013
01:16:38,258 --> 01:16:39,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you bring it up?

1014
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:43,562
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fairly simple one, so I don't think I'll have to circle or point to a tremendous amount.

1015
01:16:43,582 --> 01:16:46,004
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using a touch screen, so it sometimes gets dicey.

1016
01:16:47,485 --> 01:16:47,646
Okay.

1017
01:16:48,446 --> 01:16:49,067
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we'll see it.

1018
01:16:50,268 --> 01:16:50,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1019
01:16:51,489 --> 01:16:52,730
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Mr. McDougall.

1020
01:16:53,931 --> 01:16:55,732
[SPEAKER_00]: So the property is 10,776 square feet in size.

1021
01:16:55,752 --> 01:16:57,674
[SPEAKER_00]: It's oversized for the zoning district, which requires 5,000 square feet.

1022
01:17:05,771 --> 01:17:19,797
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike other similarly sized properties within the zoning district, it's fairly long and narrow, which has impacted how one can actually build out from the existing single family residence.

1023
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:29,328
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not reflected on the plot plan, but the topography of the lot actually increases as you go toward the rear.

1024
01:17:30,029 --> 01:17:30,729
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ms.

1025
01:17:30,749 --> 01:17:33,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan is a 20 year resident at this particular residence.

1026
01:17:34,612 --> 01:17:40,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Previously, she lived at 60 Marie Street, which is the property to the immediate rear for 30 something years.

1027
01:17:40,217 --> 01:17:45,401
[SPEAKER_00]: So she is a 50 plus year resident of this neighborhood.

1028
01:17:45,901 --> 01:17:50,285
[SPEAKER_00]: She would tell you that there's a substantial amount of subsurface ledge

1029
01:17:50,945 --> 01:18:00,872
[SPEAKER_00]: um, to the rear of this property going into the wooded areas that is affected a lot of the lots in this area and will affect where she can build on this particular lot.

1030
01:18:02,392 --> 01:18:17,482
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the single family dwelling is presently is 9.7 ft from the property's left sideline, 16.8 ft from the property's right sideline and 11.5 ft from the from the front boundary line.

1031
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:26,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that 11.5 is, uh, what makes the preexisting nonconforming, uh, status where 15 feet is required in this particular zone.

1032
01:18:27,111 --> 01:18:29,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the single family residence is somewhat dated.

1033
01:18:30,152 --> 01:18:32,153
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a post-World War II neighborhood.

1034
01:18:32,173 --> 01:18:36,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of the residences in it were built, uh, circa 1950s.

1035
01:18:36,975 --> 01:18:40,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this property was built in 1956 to be precise.

1036
01:18:40,897 --> 01:18:42,677
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it, while Ms.

1037
01:18:42,717 --> 01:18:44,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan has continually

1038
01:18:44,858 --> 01:18:58,345
[SPEAKER_00]: improved the residence, there are aspects of it that are dated, and now she's at the point where she can no longer make improvements to make a modern home without altering the structure.

1039
01:18:59,045 --> 01:18:59,945
[SPEAKER_00]: She's somewhat limited.

1040
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:11,831
[SPEAKER_00]: So the real purpose behind this addition, Mr. McDougall, if you could bring up the document called Morgan Plans Final, which are the architectural plans.

1041
01:19:23,653 --> 01:19:25,254
[SPEAKER_00]: I could also share on my screen as well.

1042
01:19:25,394 --> 01:19:27,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I just, I renamed them from my files.

1043
01:19:27,656 --> 01:19:31,458
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was trying to find what you said, and I just was not finding it, but I've got it now.

1044
01:19:31,999 --> 01:19:33,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you for that.

1045
01:19:39,664 --> 01:19:47,409
[SPEAKER_00]: And so page A1 of the architectural plans reflect what the property would look like with the addition.

1046
01:19:47,789 --> 01:19:51,912
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that the area closest to, you'll see the,

1047
01:19:53,258 --> 01:20:03,091
[SPEAKER_00]: stamped concrete proposed parking area, the stairway off that the area with the open porch there is the 10 foot by 20 foot 4 foot addition.

1048
01:20:05,074 --> 01:20:07,197
[SPEAKER_00]: If you scroll down to page A2,

1049
01:20:08,437 --> 01:20:10,958
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll provide a floor plan as to really what's being done here.

1050
01:20:12,258 --> 01:20:26,041
[SPEAKER_00]: The present kitchen and dining room area, it could be best described as a galley kitchen, very utility-based, no modern amenities, old wiring, inefficient appliances.

1051
01:20:26,661 --> 01:20:31,922
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is by doing a modest expansion, it opens up for the opportunity for placement of

1052
01:20:33,002 --> 01:20:43,949
[SPEAKER_00]: some modern appliances, modern amenities and make the house consistent with modern expectations for residential real estate properties instead of this very small cramped space.

1053
01:20:48,232 --> 01:20:55,937
[SPEAKER_00]: The proposed addition of the 240 square feet

1054
01:20:57,666 --> 01:21:01,613
[SPEAKER_00]: would increase the footprint of the existing dwelling from 1,189 square feet to 1,429 square feet.

1055
01:21:06,567 --> 01:21:27,600
[SPEAKER_00]: What's notable is that the majority of oversized lots in the neighborhood, and how I classify that is those 7,500 square feet and larger, have far larger homes, and this modest addition actually puts it right in line with the average of other homes on oversized lots.

1056
01:21:29,101 --> 01:21:31,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike many of these oversized lots,

1057
01:21:32,443 --> 01:21:42,602
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the narrowest ones there's only two other lots in the entirety of Maurice Street that are of similar size that actually have smaller frontage or smaller width than.

1058
01:21:43,595 --> 01:21:43,795
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

1059
01:21:43,835 --> 01:21:44,675
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan's property.

1060
01:21:44,856 --> 01:21:58,321
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is that in order to build off of the existing residence in a way to actually allow for this modest expansion to happen, she would need to encroach into both the front and the side setback.

1061
01:21:59,162 --> 01:22:06,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Going into the rear is both cost and ecologically inefficient.

1062
01:22:07,205 --> 01:22:10,826
[SPEAKER_00]: It would require probably doing quite a lot more site development and site impact.

1063
01:22:12,555 --> 01:22:16,458
[SPEAKER_00]: as opposed to simply building off of the existing structure.

1064
01:22:17,819 --> 01:22:19,920
[SPEAKER_00]: I will note that four of Ms.

1065
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:23,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan's neighbors have submitted letters of support for this project.

1066
01:22:24,003 --> 01:22:30,027
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not aware of any letters of opposition, but I'm sure if I'm incorrect on that, someone will correct me.

1067
01:22:32,640 --> 01:23:01,661
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of applying the variance criteria here, we believe that the unique features of this lot are its size, which is again oversized, but it's very narrow width, which limits the areas of expansion even modestly here and precludes building out to the rear, which would avoid needing a variance, but would again be financially inefficient and be more impactful

1068
01:23:02,742 --> 01:23:06,285
[SPEAKER_00]: likely requiring some work with shallow bedrock or shallow ledge.

1069
01:23:08,827 --> 01:23:22,677
[SPEAKER_00]: To move on to the parking, you'll note if you look at the image in the top right corner there, there is one existing off-street parking space and a subsurface garage.

1070
01:23:23,497 --> 01:23:23,658
[SPEAKER_00]: The

1071
01:23:25,506 --> 01:23:29,427
[SPEAKER_00]: parking space is approximately between 7 and 8 feet wide.

1072
01:23:29,708 --> 01:23:36,230
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely narrow, but it actually goes down gradient in order to access the garage and quite sharply.

1073
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:42,952
[SPEAKER_00]: The width of it makes it infeasible for use to store a garage.

1074
01:23:43,933 --> 01:23:47,017
[SPEAKER_00]: to store a vehicle within the garage except for smaller sedans.

1075
01:23:48,598 --> 01:23:57,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the nature of the steep grade going into the garage, parking within that driveway is actually physically hazardous.

1076
01:23:58,268 --> 01:23:59,810
[SPEAKER_00]: It ices up in the wintertime.

1077
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:01,331
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very narrow.

1078
01:24:02,372 --> 01:24:02,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

1079
01:24:02,612 --> 01:24:13,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan has had double knee surgery, and so she is worried for her physical safety going up that garage and using that primarily as her parking space.

1080
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:16,662
[SPEAKER_00]: So what she's had to do is utilize off-street parking.

1081
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:21,206
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that know the neighborhood, Maurice Street is very narrow.

1082
01:24:21,526 --> 01:24:24,948
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tremendous amount of use of on-street parking.

1083
01:24:26,249 --> 01:24:29,952
[SPEAKER_00]: So she has proposed to add this parking space within the front setback.

1084
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:36,897
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to allow for additional off-street parking, relying less on on-street parking.

1085
01:24:37,438 --> 01:24:52,910
[SPEAKER_00]: It also improves visibility beyond what's currently there because instead of backing out and going up gradients where there may be a blind spot, she's now going to be at grade like many of the other driveways in the neighborhood, such that she has better lines of sight when entering onto Maurice Street.

1086
01:24:55,232 --> 01:24:59,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of properties on this street have subgrade garages.

1087
01:25:01,592 --> 01:25:03,913
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we believe that's another unique factor here.

1088
01:25:05,093 --> 01:25:13,797
[SPEAKER_00]: Given this, we believe that the grants of the variance would not result in any detriment to the public good.

1089
01:25:15,237 --> 01:25:20,960
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not contrary or will not substantially derogate from the intent of the purpose of the zoning ordinance.

1090
01:25:22,872 --> 01:25:33,928
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here, you know, the additional lot coverage from this driveway would only increase the total law coverage to 15%, even if she had a just a bare minimum lot of 5000 square feet.

1091
01:25:35,423 --> 01:25:39,184
[SPEAKER_00]: she would actually still be under the 40% coverage requirement.

1092
01:25:40,424 --> 01:25:47,706
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we believe we have ample space for this without adversely impacting the neighborhood, adversely impacting folks' access to air and light.

1093
01:25:48,186 --> 01:25:55,008
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't result in overcrowding, because it's a very, very modest addition on an oversized lot to begin with.

1094
01:25:55,868 --> 01:25:58,469
[SPEAKER_00]: And we believe that if the

1095
01:25:59,855 --> 01:26:04,799
[SPEAKER_00]: variance requests were to be denied, there'd be a substantial hardship to Ms.

1096
01:26:04,839 --> 01:26:05,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan.

1097
01:26:05,219 --> 01:26:10,123
[SPEAKER_00]: She wouldn't be able to make a reasonable use of her property by bringing it up to modern standards.

1098
01:26:10,604 --> 01:26:19,611
[SPEAKER_00]: She wouldn't be able to give herself a safe parking space to be able to use her property and allow her to really age in the home more effectively and more safely.

1099
01:26:21,813 --> 01:26:27,998
[SPEAKER_00]: As she gets older, going up that driveway, and I've gone up it several times, would be hazardous.

1100
01:26:28,923 --> 01:26:32,484
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Ms.

1101
01:26:32,504 --> 01:26:38,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan to add anything that she might wish to add to this discussion and happy to answer any questions the board has.

1102
01:26:39,787 --> 01:26:40,008
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1103
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:40,688
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, everybody.

1104
01:26:40,708 --> 01:26:41,688
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello.

1105
01:26:42,188 --> 01:26:51,032
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to say, as Eric said, I have lived at 54 for the last 20 years and have wanted to redo this kitchen.

1106
01:26:51,052 --> 01:26:53,053
[SPEAKER_18]: It is very dated.

1107
01:26:53,273 --> 01:26:57,555
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's the original appliances that the house has in it.

1108
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:02,624
[SPEAKER_18]: And it would be great to be able to modernize and improve the house.

1109
01:27:02,904 --> 01:27:06,909
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, as far as the outside, um, everything he said is true.

1110
01:27:06,969 --> 01:27:13,636
[SPEAKER_18]: I have not been able to use that driveway for its purpose of a driveway for the last 20 years.

1111
01:27:14,377 --> 01:27:18,201
[SPEAKER_18]: Other than on occasion when we have street cleaning and I have no choice, but to use it.

1112
01:27:18,381 --> 01:27:19,723
[SPEAKER_18]: And it is so steep.

1113
01:27:20,946 --> 01:27:24,328
[SPEAKER_18]: It's almost scary to back out of that driveway.

1114
01:27:24,348 --> 01:27:26,970
[SPEAKER_18]: It is very, very narrow.

1115
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:30,711
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't open the door the whole way once you're in it.

1116
01:27:30,892 --> 01:27:36,334
[SPEAKER_18]: So you have to kind of squeeze out of the car and try to get out of it.

1117
01:27:36,615 --> 01:27:41,617
[SPEAKER_18]: And as he said, it is true, I have had double knee replacements in the last few months.

1118
01:27:41,897 --> 01:27:43,678
[SPEAKER_18]: So it is getting harder.

1119
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:48,322
[SPEAKER_18]: And as I get older, it's not going to get any easier.

1120
01:27:48,382 --> 01:27:58,972
[SPEAKER_18]: So a nice flat off the road spot would be really nice and safe for me to use.

1121
01:27:59,013 --> 01:28:01,875
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's really all I have to add to him.

1122
01:28:01,915 --> 01:28:03,136
[SPEAKER_18]: It's basically what he said.

1123
01:28:03,157 --> 01:28:07,301
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1124
01:28:08,001 --> 01:28:08,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Questions from the board?

1125
01:28:18,952 --> 01:28:21,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to double check my understanding.

1126
01:28:22,014 --> 01:28:35,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe one of the letters of support is the neighbor immediately abutting in the direction you're proposing to build, so 56 Maurice Street says they're in support.

1127
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:35,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right?

1128
01:28:36,484 --> 01:28:38,185
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, James Driscoll.

1129
01:28:38,765 --> 01:28:43,188
[SPEAKER_18]: I got letters from either side of my house and two across the street.

1130
01:28:45,149 --> 01:28:46,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, thank you.

1131
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:49,437
[SPEAKER_04]: other questions from the board?

1132
01:28:54,339 --> 01:28:57,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, I'll open it up to members of the public.

1133
01:28:57,541 --> 01:29:01,262
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a member of the public who would like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

1134
01:29:01,282 --> 01:29:06,685
[SPEAKER_05]: You can raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera and raise your hand, type in the chat, or you can email Dennis.

1135
01:29:18,778 --> 01:29:22,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Not seeing any members of the public who would like to speak on this matter.

1136
01:29:23,401 --> 01:29:28,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

1137
01:29:32,167 --> 01:29:32,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion.

1138
01:29:33,487 --> 01:29:34,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a second?

1139
01:29:36,069 --> 01:29:36,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

1140
01:29:36,269 --> 01:29:36,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second.

1141
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:37,970
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1142
01:29:38,090 --> 01:29:39,691
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a roll call.

1143
01:29:39,711 --> 01:29:40,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Yvette?

1144
01:29:44,054 --> 01:29:44,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1145
01:29:45,075 --> 01:29:45,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary?

1146
01:29:46,696 --> 01:29:46,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1147
01:29:47,597 --> 01:29:47,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris?

1148
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:49,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1149
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:50,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim.

1150
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:51,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1151
01:29:52,201 --> 01:29:52,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre.

1152
01:29:52,481 --> 01:29:52,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1153
01:29:53,261 --> 01:29:55,261
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1154
01:29:55,301 --> 01:29:56,081
[SPEAKER_05]: We're now deliberating.

1155
01:29:56,121 --> 01:29:56,862
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, folks?

1156
01:30:00,202 --> 01:30:01,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim, go ahead.

1157
01:30:01,422 --> 01:30:02,823
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the plan looks great.

1158
01:30:04,123 --> 01:30:11,464
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know what it's like to have a driveway that goes down into the garage.

1159
01:30:12,445 --> 01:30:14,585
[SPEAKER_06]: So I like it.

1160
01:30:14,785 --> 01:30:17,146
[SPEAKER_06]: It conforms with the neighborhood.

1161
01:30:17,206 --> 01:30:18,526
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes it look

1162
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.

1163
01:30:20,301 --> 01:30:24,745
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to let you know, I'm all in favor of that.

1164
01:30:24,765 --> 01:30:27,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1165
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:28,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Jim.

1166
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:33,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Other thoughts from the board.

1167
01:30:35,575 --> 01:30:36,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me okay?

1168
01:30:36,636 --> 01:30:36,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1169
01:30:37,256 --> 01:30:37,817
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit.

1170
01:30:37,857 --> 01:30:39,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you speak up just a little bit?

1171
01:30:39,158 --> 01:30:40,780
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having a real hard time for some reason.

1172
01:30:41,530 --> 01:30:44,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm having, I've been having audio issues, so I apologize.

1173
01:30:46,292 --> 01:30:51,314
[SPEAKER_03]: My, I just want to say thank you for the thorough presentation.

1174
01:30:52,235 --> 01:30:53,996
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate that.

1175
01:30:54,076 --> 01:30:57,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you answered all the questions that I had.

1176
01:30:57,777 --> 01:31:03,600
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate you getting the letters of support from all your abutters.

1177
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,321
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and thank you.

1178
01:31:06,341 --> 01:31:09,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I, you know, have to support this.

1179
01:31:11,412 --> 01:31:13,193
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, other thoughts from the board?

1180
01:31:20,635 --> 01:31:32,019
[SPEAKER_02]: I will add, if I could, Mr. Chair, that I think this is a very reasonable addition and extension, and it makes a lot of sense.

1181
01:31:32,659 --> 01:31:38,921
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually an improvement on the design and the look of the house.

1182
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:41,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chris.

1183
01:31:42,787 --> 01:31:43,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Other thoughts from the board?

1184
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:54,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I can go next.

1185
01:31:54,871 --> 01:31:57,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not voting, but I'll just share.

1186
01:31:57,872 --> 01:32:02,513
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do agree that the lot is unusual.

1187
01:32:02,533 --> 01:32:08,394
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unusual in its very long, relatively narrow shape.

1188
01:32:08,955 --> 01:32:10,535
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unusual topography.

1189
01:32:11,608 --> 01:32:17,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like even the soil conditions are a bit unusual in terms of the construction implications.

1190
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:31,934
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I think given the position of the existing structure and its style, there are very limited options to add space to modernize it.

1191
01:32:32,234 --> 01:32:39,376
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the neighbor, the most impacted neighbor in support, that seems like a,

1192
01:32:40,342 --> 01:32:45,744
[SPEAKER_05]: relatively harmless relief to grant in this case.

1193
01:32:45,764 --> 01:32:54,346
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, there's nothing else.

1194
01:32:55,907 --> 01:33:06,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair awaits a motion on the requested variances for the side yard setback and the parking in the front yard setback.

1195
01:33:14,232 --> 01:33:19,553
[SPEAKER_02]: motion to approve the variances for side yard and front yard setback.

1196
01:33:19,893 --> 01:33:22,653
[SPEAKER_05]: And then actually, Chris, I apologize.

1197
01:33:22,693 --> 01:33:29,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we also need a special permit for extending an existing nonconformity.

1198
01:33:30,195 --> 01:33:33,195
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to amend the motion, you can include that, too.

1199
01:33:33,935 --> 01:33:34,695
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1200
01:33:35,176 --> 01:33:40,997
[SPEAKER_02]: To add to the motion, a special permit to extend an existing nonconformity.

1201
01:33:42,277 --> 01:33:42,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1202
01:33:44,481 --> 01:33:44,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second.

1203
01:33:44,941 --> 01:33:48,182
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're going to take a roll call vote.

1204
01:33:48,602 --> 01:33:48,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre?

1205
01:33:48,962 --> 01:33:52,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1206
01:33:53,724 --> 01:33:54,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim?

1207
01:33:54,744 --> 01:33:54,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1208
01:33:55,965 --> 01:33:56,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris?

1209
01:33:57,345 --> 01:33:57,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1210
01:33:58,105 --> 01:33:58,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary?

1211
01:33:59,226 --> 01:33:59,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1212
01:34:00,286 --> 01:34:00,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Beth?

1213
01:34:01,486 --> 01:34:01,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1214
01:34:02,247 --> 01:34:06,688
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, the variances and special permit are approved.

1215
01:34:07,508 --> 01:34:08,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, folks.

1216
01:34:09,349 --> 01:34:10,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much.

1217
01:34:10,649 --> 01:34:11,850
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate your time.

1218
01:34:15,576 --> 01:34:19,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to reiterate what I've said a few times before.

1219
01:34:19,921 --> 01:34:26,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I think I think I know it's turning bar you've already kind of seem like just working on a draft decision.

1220
01:34:28,032 --> 01:34:34,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Miss Morgan had told me that it would help you if I put together a draft for you to be able to ship up to legal.

1221
01:34:36,778 --> 01:34:41,101
[SPEAKER_00]: No pride of authorship, of course, but if you need anything else from me, I'm happy to give it to you.

1222
01:34:41,141 --> 01:34:42,042
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I appreciate that.

1223
01:34:42,082 --> 01:34:47,585
[SPEAKER_15]: So then I'll review that and then I'll expedite matters very quickly.

1224
01:34:47,626 --> 01:34:48,966
[SPEAKER_15]: But then again, the methodology is the same.

1225
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:56,477
[SPEAKER_15]: Once it's in and filed in the clerk's office, that'll start the 20 days.

1226
01:34:56,537 --> 01:35:00,820
[SPEAKER_15]: And then once those 20 days are over, you get a letter of no appeal from the city clerk.

1227
01:35:01,141 --> 01:35:08,527
[SPEAKER_15]: And then once you file it in the Milosec South Courthouse in Cambridge, then you can get your building permit and get started.

1228
01:35:08,987 --> 01:35:09,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Fantastic.

1229
01:35:10,449 --> 01:35:11,049
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1230
01:35:11,129 --> 01:35:13,932
[SPEAKER_18]: Dennis, thank you so much for your help through this process.

1231
01:35:13,992 --> 01:35:14,712
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate it.

1232
01:35:14,732 --> 01:35:15,893
[SPEAKER_14]: You're very welcome.

1233
01:35:15,953 --> 01:35:16,674
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad to do it.

1234
01:35:17,415 --> 01:35:17,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, folks.

1235
01:35:18,415 --> 01:35:18,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a great one.

1236
01:35:19,476 --> 01:35:19,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1237
01:35:23,143 --> 01:35:26,707
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I think that brings us to administrative updates.

1238
01:35:26,747 --> 01:35:27,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right, Dennis?

1239
01:35:28,315 --> 01:35:30,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, we have a couple 1 is that.

1240
01:35:31,297 --> 01:35:35,981
[SPEAKER_15]: I know I said, hopefully it was going to be this meeting, but we will have the new member appointed by next meeting that it just.

1241
01:35:36,962 --> 01:35:44,408
[SPEAKER_15]: The mayor wanted me to kind of review more candidates because I had someone and she was like, just kind of spread it out a little bit more, which I appreciate, you know, just to try to make sure we can.

1242
01:35:45,088 --> 01:35:48,471
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm good solidly, so I, I put some forward to Alicia and.

1243
01:35:49,171 --> 01:35:52,474
[SPEAKER_15]: And once Alicia gets the okay, then we're going to put it.

1244
01:35:52,894 --> 01:35:57,278
[SPEAKER_15]: Back to the mayor's office, so by the time of the next meeting, we will be in full couple in the 7.

1245
01:35:58,608 --> 01:35:58,988
[SPEAKER_15]: Wonderful.

1246
01:35:59,268 --> 01:35:59,629
[SPEAKER_15]: Great news.

1247
01:36:00,829 --> 01:36:17,060
[SPEAKER_15]: And just one other thing, which it's, I will say this, I forgot to let you know, and we do have time to do this, but in, actually, this is more just a little bit inside stuff, but I've received a phone call from another, it was actually a

1248
01:36:18,395 --> 01:36:25,139
[SPEAKER_15]: Town manager out in Western Mass who they apparently have the same marijuana ordinance that Medford does.

1249
01:36:25,859 --> 01:36:34,344
[SPEAKER_15]: And within that ordinance, there's a, the special permits are only good for five years and they have to get renewed every five years.

1250
01:36:35,404 --> 01:36:44,890
[SPEAKER_15]: The ordinance doesn't actually, all it says is that it'll be renewed by a methodology basically from the special permit granting authority, which is us.

1251
01:36:45,978 --> 01:37:01,459
[SPEAKER_15]: So we only did ours, a couple years ago so we have time, some, I'm in speaking with, we have a new city solicitor so I've kind of just broached it with him and we'll come up with some sort of, we're going to find out because I mean, a lot of other towns have that same.

1252
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:07,715
[SPEAKER_15]: It was sort of a boilerplate marijuana ordinance that was created, you know, with help from the marijuana commission.

1253
01:37:07,875 --> 01:37:12,760
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're not alone in this because when I was talking to that administrator, he's talked to 4 or 5 other towns.

1254
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:13,881
[SPEAKER_15]: We're all kind of in the same boat.

1255
01:37:14,562 --> 01:37:19,767
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, we'll try to figure out what we're sort of not sure if it's going to be done administratively.

1256
01:37:19,787 --> 01:37:21,248
[SPEAKER_15]: It might just have to be, you know.

1257
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:28,443
[SPEAKER_15]: have it at a hearing just to renew and figure out some sort of methodology to do so.

1258
01:37:28,483 --> 01:37:30,244
[SPEAKER_15]: It can be something that's done by the building commissioner.

1259
01:37:30,264 --> 01:37:35,687
[SPEAKER_15]: It can be something that can be done by some of the other city people, like maybe get the chief police involved.

1260
01:37:35,707 --> 01:37:36,427
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not really sure.

1261
01:37:36,507 --> 01:37:38,448
[SPEAKER_15]: But I just wanted to kind of give you a heads up that it's coming.

1262
01:37:38,468 --> 01:37:39,669
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to figure this out.

1263
01:37:39,829 --> 01:37:47,833
[SPEAKER_15]: And the actual methodology, we'll have to sort of, I was talking to Scott, the building commissioner,

1264
01:37:49,601 --> 01:37:57,577
[SPEAKER_15]: He figures since we're redoing our rules and regs, we can add that to it as part of that and just have it in there.

1265
01:37:59,642 --> 01:38:19,614
[SPEAKER_15]: But I was very grateful for the gentleman who told me about this because, I mean, without that, I'm not sure we would have known about it because it's very, it's like, you know, very minuscule language somehow in there that just basically says the permit's good for five years and we're responsible for it, so.

1266
01:38:20,154 --> 01:38:21,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, all right, thanks for the update.

1267
01:38:22,540 --> 01:38:28,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so the, I guess we'll hear next, you'll either just bring it up in a future meeting.

1268
01:38:28,064 --> 01:38:35,950
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll probably put it on the agenda once we actually have some sort of more information, but this was more just to let you know, literally I just found out, I think it was yesterday or the day before.

1269
01:38:36,350 --> 01:38:36,770
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1270
01:38:37,170 --> 01:38:37,311
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1271
01:38:41,917 --> 01:38:47,739
[SPEAKER_15]: And the software that I was using to do the meeting minutes, that was, I just didn't realize it was Tracy DuPont's own personal one.

1272
01:38:47,759 --> 01:38:49,400
[SPEAKER_15]: So I needed to get my own.

1273
01:38:49,420 --> 01:38:50,540
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm sort of working on that.

1274
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:53,301
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's why I fell a little behind on working on it.

1275
01:38:53,741 --> 01:38:59,323
[SPEAKER_15]: So, but, uh, apparently there's a tab in zoom now that can create it.

1276
01:38:59,343 --> 01:39:06,905
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm going to look at that as well for tonight's meeting and sort of see if I can generate them because somebody else in the office has used it and they said they work pretty well.

1277
01:39:06,945 --> 01:39:08,186
[SPEAKER_15]: So, okay.

1278
01:39:08,826 --> 01:39:09,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Excuse me.

1279
01:39:09,226 --> 01:39:11,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the update, Dennis.

1280
01:39:12,961 --> 01:39:18,765
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, since we don't have meeting minutes to approve, I think that brings us to the end of our agenda, is that right?

1281
01:39:19,565 --> 01:39:20,085
[SPEAKER_05]: That is correct.

1282
01:39:20,486 --> 01:39:21,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1283
01:39:21,426 --> 01:39:24,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair awaits a motion to adjourn.

1284
01:39:24,048 --> 01:39:27,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I make a motion to adjourn.

1285
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:28,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have a second?

1286
01:39:32,353 --> 01:39:32,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

1287
01:39:33,854 --> 01:39:35,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great fourth, everyone.

1288
01:39:35,815 --> 01:39:36,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, you too.

1289
01:39:36,715 --> 01:39:40,458
[SPEAKER_05]: We still need to do a roll call, I think, Jim, but Andre?

1290
01:39:41,278 --> 01:39:41,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1291
01:39:42,279 --> 01:39:42,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim?

1292
01:39:43,566 --> 01:39:43,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1293
01:39:44,629 --> 01:39:44,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris.

1294
01:39:46,432 --> 01:39:46,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1295
01:39:47,214 --> 01:39:47,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary.

1296
01:39:47,575 --> 01:39:48,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1297
01:39:49,158 --> 01:39:49,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Beth.

1298
01:39:50,421 --> 01:39:50,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1299
01:39:51,222 --> 01:39:51,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike.

1300
01:39:51,803 --> 01:39:51,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1301
01:39:52,304 --> 01:39:52,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1302
01:39:52,825 --> 01:39:53,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a great fourth indeed.

1303
01:39:53,828 --> 01:39:54,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay safe everyone.
