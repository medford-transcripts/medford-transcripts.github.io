00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:04,735
Hello and welcome to this regular meeting of the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals.

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:07,758
We're going to take a quick roll call and then we'll get started.

3
00:00:10,961 --> 00:00:11,162
Jim?

4
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:13,444
Present.

5
00:00:13,504 --> 00:00:14,485
Mary Lee?

6
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:15,085
Present.

7
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:33,027
Andre?

8
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:39,672
Can folks hear me?

9
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:41,573
Yeah, I've got you.

10
00:00:41,593 --> 00:00:42,414
So I think it's Andre's.

11
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:46,216
Okay, well, I see Andre is present.

12
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:49,078
So he'll work to resolve the audio issues.

13
00:00:49,678 --> 00:00:50,319
Christy Evetta?

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:51,860
Present.

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,461
Yvette Velez?

16
00:00:55,482 --> 00:00:55,843
Present.

17
00:00:56,763 --> 00:00:57,884
Mike Caldera, present.

18
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:00,792
All right, so we have a quorum.

19
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:02,373
We can get started.

20
00:01:02,434 --> 00:01:03,694
Dennis, could you please kick us off?

21
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:04,515
Sure.

22
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:12,961
Actually, the first thing I want to do is that we got a request to continue 121 2nd Street from the attorney.

23
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:22,168
We've received an email from them just asking if they could continue that to the meeting on, sorry, my calendar is a bit wonky right now.

24
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:24,469
It'll be July 31st.

25
00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:24,870
July 31st, OK.

26
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:30,529
Um, so we got an email.

27
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:32,730
Do we have anyone present for that one?

28
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:38,472
Okay.

29
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:42,033
Um, well, we haven't heard any.

30
00:01:43,014 --> 00:01:46,355
Testimony in that case, so customarily we will just continue.

31
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:54,339
These cases, if so requested by the applicant, so chair awaits a motion to continue this matter.

32
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:57,040
To our next regular meeting on July 31st.

33
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:00,967
Motion.

34
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:02,469
So the second.

35
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:03,449
Second.

36
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,610
All right.

37
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:06,752
We're going to take a roll call.

38
00:02:08,013 --> 00:02:08,493
Jim.

39
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:09,374
Aye.

40
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:10,695
Mary.

41
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:11,516
Aye.

42
00:02:12,777 --> 00:02:13,237
Andre.

43
00:02:13,257 --> 00:02:15,159
Aye.

44
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:16,800
Chris.

45
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:18,481
Aye.

46
00:02:19,342 --> 00:02:19,702
Yvette.

47
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:22,224
Aye.

48
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:23,445
Mike.

49
00:02:23,826 --> 00:02:23,926
Aye.

50
00:02:24,386 --> 00:02:24,646
All right.

51
00:02:24,947 --> 00:02:26,548
That one's continued to our next meeting.

52
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:28,970
All right, what's next, Dennis?

53
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:34,193
The next matter is 38 Harvard Avenue, case number A-2024-03.

54
00:02:34,213 --> 00:02:51,223
Applicant and owner OB's Automotive Collision Center are requesting a six-month extension on a variance granted by the Board of Appeals with the decision dated on June 14th, 2024 and filed on June 27th, 2024 until December 14th, 2025 to sell class two used motor vehicles at 38 Harvard Avenue.

55
00:02:52,204 --> 00:02:52,724
Thank you, Dennis.

56
00:02:52,784 --> 00:02:54,505
I see we have attorney Desmond here for the applicant.

57
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:57,891
Good afternoon, Chairman Calderia, board members.

58
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:05,115
I had requested this extension under the what was, I believe, the current law.

59
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:17,822
However, I sent to Dennis today as I was looking at this this evening in the Massachusetts Economic Leadership Act, which Governor Healey signed in late November.

60
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:26,700
It appears that, and I sent you both, KP Law had a update, and also I sent you the portion of the statute, section 280.

61
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:34,123
The statute itself is this much double-sided paper, so it's a little difficult to see where it is.

62
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:39,685
But in any event, it appears that any variance in existence between

63
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:50,673
January of 2023 and January of 2025 is automatically extended if it was in existence by operation of law for a period of two years.

64
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:55,115
And the statute itself specifically deals with chapter 48.

65
00:03:56,355 --> 00:03:58,856
I don't know if you've had an opportunity to look at it.

66
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:03,678
I just saw it at quarter of six tonight and sent it along to you.

67
00:04:04,838 --> 00:04:09,660
But I wanted to at least know that the board would be willing to grant a six month extension.

68
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:17,558
We ran into a little bit of an issue with the application for the license that needs to go before City Council for approval.

69
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:27,163
The applicant is now required to obtain the certificate of compliance with the DOR and that took a little bit of time to set up the account.

70
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:31,490
The EIN number had to be worked out and then it came to tax season.

71
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,792
So then the tax returns had to be filed.

72
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:38,796
And once those were filed, the workers' compensation certificate was due to expire.

73
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:42,780
So it's just been kind of trying to get things in the right order and all.

74
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,601
in good standing to bring it before the council.

75
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:54,945
We have taken all of the reports that are required from the admissible departments, all but the traffic is in.

76
00:04:55,325 --> 00:05:01,588
So we're in a position to go before the city council within within a month or so anyway.

77
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,089
Okay, thank you.

78
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,892
So I mean, customarily, that's something that we would typically vote to

79
00:05:10,898 --> 00:05:12,039
agree to the extension.

80
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:15,982
It sounds like under the new law, you don't even need us to take action.

81
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:21,226
So, Attorney Desmond, are you comfortable proceeding without the board taking a vote in light of that?

82
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:37,998
I'd like the board to take a vote just on the six months in case there's some exception, excluding Kathleen A. Desmond's variances that were granted, something wonky of that nature, just to know that under the old ordinance or under statute, I would still be valid and still have the six month extension.

83
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:38,858
Thank you.

84
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:39,999
All right, sounds good.

85
00:05:40,826 --> 00:05:42,447
thoughts from members of the board?

86
00:05:49,971 --> 00:05:55,154
Hearing none, chair awaits a motion to grant the six-month extension.

87
00:05:57,235 --> 00:05:57,575
Motion.

88
00:05:58,756 --> 00:05:59,056
Second.

89
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:00,717
Second.

90
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:02,698
All right, we'll take a roll call.

91
00:06:02,718 --> 00:06:03,138
Yvette?

92
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:09,922
Yvette?

93
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,620
Hi, sorry, technical difficulties too.

94
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:14,641
No worries.

95
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:15,581
Hi.

96
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:19,082
Chris.

97
00:06:20,282 --> 00:06:20,542
Hi.

98
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:21,883
Andre.

99
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:23,483
Hi.

100
00:06:24,563 --> 00:06:24,943
Mary.

101
00:06:25,523 --> 00:06:25,804
Hi.

102
00:06:26,664 --> 00:06:26,964
Jim.

103
00:06:27,544 --> 00:06:27,824
Hi.

104
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:28,924
Mike.

105
00:06:29,204 --> 00:06:29,384
Hi.

106
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:30,165
All right.

107
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:32,185
You have your extension.

108
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:33,445
Thank you very much.

109
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:34,806
Have a nice 4th of July, folks.

110
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:35,666
Thanks, you too.

111
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:38,687
Great.

112
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:39,667
What's next, Dennis?

113
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,439
Next is 173 Arlington Street.

114
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:55,769
Applicant and owner, Don Foote, to install an addition of 173 Arlington Street within the side yard setback extending existing side yard setback nonconformity, which is not allowed per the City Methods Zoning Ordinance Chapter 94 Table of Dimensional Requirements.

115
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:57,550
All right, great.

116
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,993
And I see we do have a Don Foote on the call.

117
00:07:01,674 --> 00:07:02,414
Hello and welcome.

118
00:07:05,317 --> 00:07:05,517
Yep.

119
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:06,237
Can you hear me?

120
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:07,498
Yes, we can hear you.

121
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:08,359
Right.

122
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:18,602
We have a tiny 910-square-foot single-family home that's in antique and in disrepair.

123
00:07:21,464 --> 00:07:33,334
We're going to just extend the rear out 12.5 feet, the exact width of the house so we can have a three-bedroom, two-bath home.

124
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:37,117
That's pretty much it.

125
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:47,527
My understanding is that in extending the home in this way, you're not creating any new non-conformities.

126
00:07:47,587 --> 00:07:48,027
Is that right?

127
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:50,750
You're just extending an existing non-conformity?

128
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,232
Just extending an existing non-conformity.

129
00:07:54,353 --> 00:08:00,779
The right side non-conformity, which is we're 2 and 1⁄2 feet from the right side setback.

130
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:02,040
We're supposed to be 7 and 1⁄2 feet.

131
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,022
So we're going to extend that straight back.

132
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:12,602
All right, so in light of that, the standard we need to apply here is the special permit standard.

133
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:21,646
So if there's no substantial detriment to the public good, then that would be allowable under the Medford ordinance.

134
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:24,747
So Mr. Foote, did you want to?

135
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:29,285
show us plans or anything, or have Dennis present those?

136
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:30,967
I've submitted plans.

137
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:37,151
It's a very modest addition of about 440 square feet.

138
00:08:37,171 --> 00:08:48,479
We're going to still have a very modest home of 1,300 and something square feet, so I don't think we're really impacting the neighborhood in any

139
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,523
way, except we're going to totally rehab the house and make it beautiful again.

140
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:57,287
It's a beautiful older home that's just been falling into disrepair.

141
00:08:58,888 --> 00:08:59,348
Thanks, Dennis.

142
00:08:59,368 --> 00:09:01,210
Could you maybe just pull that up?

143
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:01,611
OK, great.

144
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:04,313
And by the way, I forgot to say this at the beginning.

145
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:08,757
So we have six members of the board present, five vote.

146
00:09:08,837 --> 00:09:14,122
So I'm appointing every member except for myself as voting members on this one.

147
00:09:18,712 --> 00:09:27,077
All right, so looks like we have a lot that's got 35 foot of frontage, but it's also 35 foot wide.

148
00:09:29,558 --> 00:09:37,322
And so, yeah, the existing dwelling is about two and a half foot from this orientation left side.

149
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:42,105
And so the addition is just extending a little bit back.

150
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:47,268
OK, I'll open it up to questions from the board.

151
00:10:00,662 --> 00:10:03,324
I'm not seeing any questions from the board.

152
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:09,507
I'll just say it looks straightforward to me, so I do not have any questions.

153
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:14,290
I'll now open it up to public comment.

154
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,172
If you're a member of the public and you'd like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

155
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:22,394
You can raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera and raise your hand.

156
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:27,617
You can type in the chat, or you can email dennisdmcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

157
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:45,611
I do not see any members of the public who would like to speak on this matter.

158
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:51,134
So the chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberations.

159
00:10:56,538 --> 00:10:56,898
Motion.

160
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:58,279
Do I have a second?

161
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,560
Second.

162
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,642
All right, we'll take a roll call.

163
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:03,762
Jim?

164
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:04,583
Aye.

165
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:05,704
Andre?

166
00:11:05,724 --> 00:11:05,784
Aye.

167
00:11:06,744 --> 00:11:08,105
Chris?

168
00:11:09,026 --> 00:11:09,166
Aye.

169
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:10,147
Mary?

170
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:10,227
Aye.

171
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,273
I. All right, the board is now deliberating.

172
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:18,094
What do you think, folks?

173
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:28,743
I can start.

174
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:31,585
It looks like a great improvement to the home.

175
00:11:31,945 --> 00:11:37,690
The addition is pretty minimal, including the dormers addition on top.

176
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,272
I mean, I think it's a small,

177
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:46,074
existing and small addition, in all honesty.

178
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:48,635
Right.

179
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:50,456
Other thoughts from the board?

180
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:02,459
Seeing none.

181
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:08,001
Yeah, so even though this isn't part of the standard, I mean, there's no real

182
00:12:08,692 --> 00:12:10,653
other way to extend this building.

183
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:15,154
So it happens to be too close in the side yard setback.

184
00:12:15,394 --> 00:12:16,615
It's not making it any worse.

185
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,797
Seems like there's not any members of the public raising concerns.

186
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:26,058
So I'm not seeing a substantial detriment here.

187
00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:31,920
So I'm not voting, but in general, I think it meets the standard.

188
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,680
Thank you.

189
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:35,021
All right.

190
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:37,682
Other thoughts from the board?

191
00:12:44,337 --> 00:12:46,998
being none, chair awaits a motion.

192
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:48,859
Oh, did you have something you wanted to say, Andre?

193
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:49,159
Sorry.

194
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:53,261
No, I was just going to underscore what Yvette said.

195
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:53,781
I agree.

196
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:54,841
Okay.

197
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:59,023
Chair awaits a motion on this matter.

198
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:05,366
So there's a request for a special permit to extend the existing non-conformity.

199
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:11,288
So moved.

200
00:13:11,843 --> 00:13:13,544
But technically, I didn't make a motion.

201
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:17,848
So you're going to have to.

202
00:13:17,948 --> 00:13:18,008
OK.

203
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:22,132
Motion to approve the special permit for 173 Arlington Street.

204
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:23,873
Do I have a second?

205
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:25,975
I'll second.

206
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:27,176
All right.

207
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:28,957
We're going to take a roll call vote.

208
00:13:29,378 --> 00:13:29,738
Yvette?

209
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:30,999
Aye.

210
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,300
Aye.

211
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:33,281
Mary?

212
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:34,041
Aye.

213
00:13:34,782 --> 00:13:35,122
Chris?

214
00:13:35,923 --> 00:13:36,043
Aye.

215
00:13:37,144 --> 00:13:37,484
Andre?

216
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:38,725
Aye.

217
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:39,906
Jim?

218
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:40,667
Aye.

219
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,125
All right, your special permit is approved.

220
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:45,468
Thanks so much.

221
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:47,553
Appreciate your help.

222
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:55,133
And Don, so now in this situation, I'm the one who writes up the decision.

223
00:13:55,893 --> 00:14:03,639
Luckily for you in this instance, your neighbors had a very similar, pretty much the exact same case, you know, a few months ago.

224
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,563
So I basically had that decision pretty much written and it's already been like checked by our legal counsel.

225
00:14:08,603 --> 00:14:14,347
So I should just be able to, you know, go through it and just make sure that, you know, change some things out to,

226
00:14:15,478 --> 00:14:16,318
you know, for yours.

227
00:14:16,378 --> 00:14:18,198
So I think the turnaround in yours should be pretty quick.

228
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:25,480
So once the decision's written and approved and signed by the members, then it gets filed in the city clerk's office.

229
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,940
That starts a 20 days appeals period.

230
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:44,243
At the conclusion of that 20 days appeals period, you know, you just go to the clerk's office, get a letter basically saying there's been no appeal, file that decision at the Middlesex South Courthouse, and then you can get your building permit.

231
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:46,127
Great, thanks so much, Dennis.

232
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:50,148
And I think I still need to do a ConCom application with you, correct?

233
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:50,768
You do, yes.

234
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:55,949
So I'm out tomorrow, but on Monday, give me a call, and we can start going through that process.

235
00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:01,410
Yeah, I should have all my paperwork together by beginning next week.

236
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,490
I'll see you then.

237
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:02,850
Thank you.

238
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:03,710
Thanks, everyone.

239
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:05,371
Thank you.

240
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:05,671
Good night.

241
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:08,831
All right, what's next, Dennis?

242
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:17,472
There we go.

243
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:18,152
58 Myrtle Street.

244
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:33,955
Applicant and owner Bartlett Development LLC to alter and extend an existing single family residence at 58 Myrtle Street within the side yard setback extending existing side yard setback nonconformity and add a third floor which is not allowed for the City of Medford Zoning Ordinance Chapter 94 Table of Dimensional Requirements.

245
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:36,716
All right, thank you.

246
00:15:36,976 --> 00:15:41,437
For this case, again, I'll be appointing the other members of the board as voting members.

247
00:15:41,997 --> 00:15:42,577
Do we have

248
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:47,372
Do you have the applicant or representative for the applicant present?

249
00:15:47,973 --> 00:15:50,274
Attorney Bill O'Keefe, online.

250
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:52,416
Hello, welcome.

251
00:15:52,456 --> 00:15:53,176
Great, you can hear me.

252
00:15:53,396 --> 00:15:56,979
I appreciate everybody's time on this cool night.

253
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,381
Just wanted to give an update with regards to the applicant.

254
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:07,986
He's just proposing to alter and extend an existing, pre-existing, non-conforming, single-family residence on Merrill Street.

255
00:16:08,306 --> 00:16:10,788
The existing structure right now is a one-story home.

256
00:16:11,453 --> 00:16:14,956
with a small attic and a non-conforming due to the side setbacks.

257
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:21,922
The proposed work includes a vertical expansion to the removal of the existing roof and construction of a full second floor.

258
00:16:22,836 --> 00:16:32,502
Additionally, the project includes a horizontal expansion of the building footprint by approximately 4 feet to accommodate the reconfiguration of the exterior living space.

259
00:16:33,163 --> 00:16:43,149
A new level is also being proposed above the 2nd floor, which contained an unfinished storage area and remain below the threshold that would constitute a full 3rd story.

260
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:43,389
Um.

261
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:54,260
While the dormant areas are included in the added design, the building will remain compliant with the zoning definition of a two-and-a-half-story structure.

262
00:16:55,281 --> 00:17:04,284
The total gross living area will increase from approximately 1,435 square feet to 29 and 24 square feet.

263
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:14,747
The project doesn't increase the degree of non-conformity related to the existing site setbacks and does not propose to add any new conforming elements.

264
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:25,522
We proposed a few of the plans so that the board can see and just seeking relief with regards to the special permit.

265
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:31,307
I know when I did the description, I was working with Dennis on this too as well.

266
00:17:31,347 --> 00:17:34,089
The work description was to add a dormitory to this property.

267
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,694
That was to stop my narrative and unfortunately I couldn't switch

268
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:55,654
The verbiage in there locked in on me when I sent the, the application, but I know there was some confusion with the, the commissioner and we worked through him and Dennis in order to get some clarity with regard to the scope of the work.

269
00:17:56,294 --> 00:18:01,237
But I wanted to appreciate everybody's time in terms of processing this application with me.

270
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:03,519
Right.

271
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,079
Thank you.

272
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:04,640
So.

273
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,133
I would like to see the plans, just so everyone has a shared awareness.

274
00:18:13,173 --> 00:18:18,856
So, Attorney O'Keefe, is that something you can share, or Dennis, you could help Attorney O'Keefe share?

275
00:18:19,076 --> 00:18:20,336
I have them with a file.

276
00:18:20,356 --> 00:18:25,039
I'm not sure if... I can bring them up.

277
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:28,661
Which one do you want first, the plot plan or the architectural plans?

278
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:30,322
I do the architectural plan.

279
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:34,144
That'll give a big picture in terms of everything that's being done.

280
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:40,819
I'm sure this board's aware of in terms of this area, in terms of the work and the scope that's being done over there.

281
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,623
It's been a busy area.

282
00:18:48,246 --> 00:18:54,631
Nothing that's going to impede or impact the neighborhood in terms of an architectural design.

283
00:18:54,671 --> 00:19:00,236
It would fit in nicely with the current homes that are being developed over there.

284
00:19:00,987 --> 00:19:09,951
Um, this is an older home, um, that just needs a little bit modernization and, um, space for, uh, for future families.

285
00:19:09,971 --> 00:19:15,754
All right, great.

286
00:19:24,858 --> 00:19:29,320
So, it looks like we're currently looking at the existing elevation.

287
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:29,940
Yes.

288
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:46,506
Right, and here are the proposed elevations.

289
00:19:47,907 --> 00:19:50,248
Questions from the board so far?

290
00:20:00,772 --> 00:20:11,697
One question I have is, functionally, what's the purpose of the dormers on the half floor up top?

291
00:20:13,007 --> 00:20:16,549
It seems a bit unusual to have dormers for attic spaces.

292
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:19,570
Yeah, I believe they have the central area.

293
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:31,255
Nelson, I'm not sure if you're on the call, but I know on the other slide, I think it'll show how the layout is for inside the dormer space.

294
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:34,616
I believe that.

295
00:20:36,357 --> 00:20:36,737
I can't.

296
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:41,539
Yeah, so on the right there, maybe if you could zoom in a little, Dennis.

297
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:52,974
Um, yeah, so it looks like there's HVAC room on one side.

298
00:20:52,994 --> 00:21:01,800
It's, yeah, and then the dormer looks like it maybe extends out past that.

299
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:02,661
Yes.

300
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:03,221
Yeah.

301
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:20,844
Okay, so if I'm understanding correctly, you think that maybe the HVAC was a factor, but you're not entirely sure.

302
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:25,187
In terms of the design for the attic space, that's my understanding of it.

303
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:27,288
And just for headroom.

304
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:29,890
I see, okay.

305
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,592
Other questions from the board?

306
00:21:39,336 --> 00:21:40,837
Mr. Chair, yeah, through you.

307
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,701
Just a question.

308
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:50,625
So the four feet additional extension of the house, is that towards the garage?

309
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:51,365
Is that correct?

310
00:21:51,426 --> 00:21:52,966
It looks wider, the new version.

311
00:21:53,587 --> 00:21:54,767
Looks closer to the garage.

312
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:56,448
I believe so.

313
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:03,252
And is the existing garage staying the same?

314
00:22:03,272 --> 00:22:06,414
That is my understanding, yes.

315
00:22:07,814 --> 00:22:08,475
Same dimensions.

316
00:22:10,223 --> 00:22:10,843
Thank you.

317
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:11,364
Yeah.

318
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:18,428
Okay.

319
00:22:18,928 --> 00:22:20,249
Other questions from the board.

320
00:22:25,892 --> 00:22:26,412
Mr. chair.

321
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:26,652
Yeah.

322
00:22:27,193 --> 00:22:32,436
If I could, I don't see the building commissioner on here, but I guess, is there a.

323
00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:50,439
Thought seven and a half feet was a minimum for the third floor or habitable floor, but perhaps that's something that we could ask Attorney O'Keefe to do.

324
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:52,900
Yeah, he was reviewing that.

325
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,801
He had a question with regards to that.

326
00:22:55,181 --> 00:23:04,185
I know he put something, let me just find out what he wrote, because he had some questions that we answered and I believe he's satisfied.

327
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,461
Yeah, he he has something on file here too.

328
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:17,625
Yeah, he just did the narrative of the project, but.

329
00:23:20,606 --> 00:23:23,848
Yeah, we're not looking to go above the 2 and a half story structure.

330
00:23:24,728 --> 00:23:27,969
So, if the 7 and a half feet is an issue, then.

331
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:34,152
I mean, we can come back and address that when the permits being pulled.

332
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,503
So obviously, if it doesn't meet the building code, then we're not seeking relief for that.

333
00:23:40,523 --> 00:23:45,426
So we'll have to modify the design to meet that criteria.

334
00:23:47,707 --> 00:23:48,288
Yeah, for sure.

335
00:23:48,328 --> 00:23:51,570
That'll be a building code issue, just out of curiosity.

336
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,531
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

337
00:23:53,811 --> 00:24:00,895
I know he mentioned something about the roof line, but we're within the roof line criteria.

338
00:24:00,935 --> 00:24:03,777
But I think that might have been something that he also had an issue with.

339
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:13,013
All right, other questions from the board?

340
00:24:19,437 --> 00:24:24,539
Not seeing any, so I will open the public portion of the hearing.

341
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:28,181
If you're a member of the public and you'd like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

342
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:33,084
You can raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera and raise your hand, type in the chat, or you can...

343
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:49,571
I'm not seeing any members of the public who would like to speak on this matter.

344
00:24:49,591 --> 00:24:56,473
So the chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

345
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:02,695
Andre?

346
00:25:03,415 --> 00:25:06,696
Motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberations.

347
00:25:06,716 --> 00:25:08,257
Do I have a second?

348
00:25:09,797 --> 00:25:10,077
Second.

349
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:11,658
All right.

350
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:12,158
Yvette?

351
00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:16,734
Jim.

352
00:25:18,535 --> 00:25:18,675
Aye.

353
00:25:19,635 --> 00:25:19,955
Mary.

354
00:25:20,715 --> 00:25:20,855
Aye.

355
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:21,855
Chris.

356
00:25:22,616 --> 00:25:22,776
Aye.

357
00:25:23,616 --> 00:25:24,016
Andre.

358
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:24,896
Aye.

359
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:26,117
Jim.

360
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:26,837
Aye.

361
00:25:26,857 --> 00:25:28,977
All right.

362
00:25:29,017 --> 00:25:30,118
We're now deliberating.

363
00:25:30,138 --> 00:25:31,058
What do you think, folks?

364
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:45,882
Can I ask why the city is not allowed to add a third floor?

365
00:25:48,468 --> 00:25:54,814
Um, I'm not sure any of us could say that with certainty, Mary.

366
00:25:55,955 --> 00:26:02,862
It's just a long standing dimensional requirement in this district.

367
00:26:03,382 --> 00:26:11,490
There's this distinction between a half floor and a full floor and it's measured as

368
00:26:13,117 --> 00:26:26,543
whether the, I think the livable space above seven foot in height, whether that is or isn't more than 50% of the gross floor area of the floor below it.

369
00:26:27,784 --> 00:26:40,530
And for whatever reason, when that ordinance was put into effect, they said this zone, two and a half is the max and this,

370
00:26:41,903 --> 00:26:45,344
this proposal, to be clear, does meet that definition.

371
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:53,885
But yeah, I don't personally know specifically why they said not three stories in this zone.

372
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:57,826
If I can, it's about overdevelopment back in the day.

373
00:27:00,927 --> 00:27:01,807
That was a concern.

374
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:08,988
But now with the housing crisis and everything taking place, everything's on the drawing board.

375
00:27:12,637 --> 00:27:12,917
Thanks.

376
00:27:14,598 --> 00:27:16,398
Great thoughts from the board.

377
00:27:28,003 --> 00:27:31,444
I don't think this is out of character with some of the other properties on the street.

378
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:40,968
So I don't think there's any kind of negative public impact of this and doesn't change the

379
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:53,081
the footprint of the house itself, like in terms of being extended back or towards the neighbor on the left side doesn't, uh, doesn't seem to be any impact there.

380
00:27:53,101 --> 00:28:03,044
So, um, so Andre, just, just to be clear, there is a four foot horizontal expansion of the building footprint.

381
00:28:03,864 --> 00:28:06,224
Yeah, but it's towards the garage towards the driveway.

382
00:28:06,404 --> 00:28:06,704
Yeah.

383
00:28:06,904 --> 00:28:07,084
Yeah.

384
00:28:07,204 --> 00:28:07,464
Okay.

385
00:28:09,725 --> 00:28:09,985
All right.

386
00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:11,094
Yeah, I agree.

387
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:12,875
It's a good, it seems like a good project.

388
00:28:14,196 --> 00:28:15,077
Okay.

389
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:16,418
Other thoughts from the board?

390
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,361
I also agree with Andre and Chris.

391
00:28:21,381 --> 00:28:23,843
I think it's a great project.

392
00:28:27,186 --> 00:28:28,187
All right.

393
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:29,988
Other thoughts from the board?

394
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:44,734
So to grant this relief, the standard is a special permit, so we would have to find no substantial detriment to the public good.

395
00:28:47,415 --> 00:28:51,117
So if there's no other deliberation, Chair awaits a motion.

396
00:28:53,458 --> 00:29:00,541
Motion to approve the special permit for, I forget the address, 58 Myrtle Street.

397
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:01,962
Do I have a second?

398
00:29:02,642 --> 00:29:03,202
I'll second.

399
00:29:04,483 --> 00:29:04,683
All right.

400
00:29:05,168 --> 00:29:06,369
I'm gonna take a roll call.

401
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:06,749
Jim?

402
00:29:07,489 --> 00:29:07,610
Aye.

403
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:08,930
Andre?

404
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,131
Aye.

405
00:29:11,092 --> 00:29:11,452
Chris?

406
00:29:12,172 --> 00:29:12,292
Aye.

407
00:29:12,973 --> 00:29:13,373
Mary?

408
00:29:13,393 --> 00:29:14,174
Aye.

409
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:14,994
Beth?

410
00:29:15,094 --> 00:29:15,194
Aye.

411
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:17,496
All right.

412
00:29:17,516 --> 00:29:20,077
You have your special permit.

413
00:29:21,198 --> 00:29:22,219
I appreciate everybody's time.

414
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:22,839
Thank you so much.

415
00:29:25,688 --> 00:29:30,409
And Attorney O'Keefe, so basically deco what I sort of said before, you know, I'll work on the decision.

416
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:41,811
And I mean, if you want, I can send you one to just sort of, if you wanted to do a draft to sort of expedite it a little quicker, I'll get you one in the next day or so, just so you can start in on it.

417
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:44,311
And then that'll sort of move the process on a little quicker.

418
00:29:44,431 --> 00:29:44,631
So.

419
00:29:44,811 --> 00:29:46,392
No, Dennis, I appreciate your time.

420
00:29:46,412 --> 00:29:47,052
Thank you so much.

421
00:29:47,072 --> 00:29:49,712
All right.

422
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:50,712
Wonderful.

423
00:29:50,732 --> 00:29:52,593
All right.

424
00:29:52,633 --> 00:29:53,333
What's next, Dennis?

425
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:54,973
Thanks.

426
00:29:58,859 --> 00:29:59,880
141 Wall Street.

427
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:07,184
Applicant and owner Lucy Siddall at a third floor at 141 Wall Street, which is an existing non-conforming structure in a single family, two zoning district.

428
00:30:07,204 --> 00:30:09,806
It's not allowed for the City of Medford zoning ordinance.

429
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:16,109
This will also extend the existing non-conforming front yard setback requiring a special permit for the City of Medford zoning ordinance.

430
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:21,052
All right, so we have Lucy Siddall on the call.

431
00:30:21,393 --> 00:30:22,013
Hello and welcome.

432
00:30:22,113 --> 00:30:22,453
I'm here.

433
00:30:22,473 --> 00:30:24,494
Hi, welcome.

434
00:30:24,534 --> 00:30:25,875
Hi, can you hear me okay?

435
00:30:26,195 --> 00:30:26,916
Yes, we can hear you.

436
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:27,938
Okay, great.

437
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:29,399
Hi, everyone.

438
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:30,440
Thank you so much for your time.

439
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,200
We apply for this.

440
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,782
So we're actually a special permit with a zoning variance.

441
00:30:35,802 --> 00:30:36,463
So we're doing both.

442
00:30:37,483 --> 00:30:40,405
We want to finish our third floor added.

443
00:30:41,485 --> 00:30:43,386
Right now it's lined up and not finished.

444
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:49,009
And we want to, the special permit is for the dormers on both sides.

445
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:50,270
One of them is for the stairs.

446
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,612
Having a dormer is the only way we can get a flight of stairs up to the third floor.

447
00:30:55,598 --> 00:30:58,980
And then the other dorm was to raise the ceiling height to have habitable space.

448
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:03,923
And we wanted to make it a full third floor.

449
00:31:04,023 --> 00:31:17,651
We had initially drafted it up to be what we thought was a half of the second floor, but we actually found out that permit for the closets and storage space are also counted as habitable.

450
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:22,954
And so it was actually the building commissioner who proposed the idea of like, hey, you know,

451
00:31:24,211 --> 00:31:28,074
go for the full third floor variance just so that you can get the space that you need.

452
00:31:29,275 --> 00:31:32,597
Right now, we, you know, my husband and I both work from home.

453
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,119
He's a stay at home dad.

454
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:35,340
I work from home full time.

455
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,601
We have a kid.

456
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:39,042
So it's, it's getting quite quiet then.

457
00:31:39,783 --> 00:31:40,684
Yeah, that's you.

458
00:31:41,805 --> 00:31:45,427
And it's, you know, we are also in an undersized lot.

459
00:31:45,527 --> 00:31:52,833
We don't really have anywhere else to meaningfully expand to other than like a small mudroom that we'd like to put in that goes into our yard.

460
00:31:53,735 --> 00:32:03,685
Um, and we did also speak with our closest to butter, um, on aim street and did get their, uh, approval and support for our project as well.

461
00:32:04,285 --> 00:32:07,969
And so, um, we're hopeful that we can move forward with the plan.

462
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:09,771
Right.

463
00:32:09,891 --> 00:32:10,351
Thank you.

464
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:16,837
And, uh, one question I have upfront, I just want to make sure the board's understanding the

465
00:32:19,595 --> 00:32:25,799
space that actually counts per the Medford ordinance on the plans.

466
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,281
Maybe it's best to go through it when the plans are up.

467
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:35,665
But yeah, I saw on the actual submission that the calculation was 49.8%.

468
00:32:36,065 --> 00:32:42,790
So I'm assuming that must have been before the building commissioner's clarification.

469
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:43,250
Is that right?

470
00:32:44,146 --> 00:32:44,546
Correct.

471
00:32:44,686 --> 00:32:56,073
Yeah, that was what we, so what we understood, and our architect who had been on sort of other places with the boards, that was his, he wasn't sure, so he sort of didn't count the storage space, and so that was his calculation.

472
00:32:56,873 --> 00:33:07,139
And then the building commissioner actually clarified to us via email that he was like, as it is, you're going to require a special permit because any storage space is counted as habitable.

473
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:10,161
If any person is going to be there for any given amount of time, it counts here.

474
00:33:11,161 --> 00:33:13,743
And so because of that, we adjusted our plans to try to

475
00:33:14,517 --> 00:33:28,086
maximize our attic space to be livable since we were going to have to either wall it all off so we couldn't use it just to be able to just do a special permit, but we would love to be able to use that space for our family, so we went for the variance as well.

476
00:33:29,327 --> 00:33:30,227
I see, okay.

477
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:39,033
So the plans I'm looking at, they still have low ceilings in the storage areas.

478
00:33:39,073 --> 00:33:40,514
Are there new plans with

479
00:33:42,307 --> 00:33:42,947
with four?

480
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:49,510
So yeah, our understanding is any storage area is still considered living space.

481
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,370
That was what we were told.

482
00:33:51,251 --> 00:33:57,533
Right, but you just said that you decided, okay, well, we're doing three floors anyway, so we might as well.

483
00:33:57,813 --> 00:34:02,335
Yeah, and I apologize for it, but the May 16th plan is our current plan.

484
00:34:02,515 --> 00:34:03,276
That is our plan.

485
00:34:03,996 --> 00:34:04,836
Got it.

486
00:34:05,436 --> 00:34:11,639
If you don't have that, I'm happy to share my screen, but that's the plan that we're submitting for the zoning variance as well as a special permit.

487
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:18,893
Yeah, the plans I'm seeing are, I think they're dated April 19th.

488
00:34:19,553 --> 00:34:27,937
Oh yeah, you're looking at the special permit one for the dorms, but I submitted a more recent one, so I can show it to you if you'd like me to share it.

489
00:34:28,117 --> 00:34:30,319
Or I don't know if Dennis, that's something that you do?

490
00:34:32,002 --> 00:34:38,207
It can be there if you have it up right now, because I think part of the issue was there were two separate applications.

491
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:41,189
So let me just let you, if you have them handy, I'll just let you do them.

492
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:42,290
Okay.

493
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:45,373
I sent a share request.

494
00:34:45,473 --> 00:34:46,534
Oh, here we go.

495
00:34:46,554 --> 00:34:46,834
Okay.

496
00:34:48,155 --> 00:34:51,357
By the way, I forgot to say at the beginning, it'll be the same voting members.

497
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:52,498
So I'm not voting.

498
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:57,982
So this is the plan.

499
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:01,823
dated 16th.

500
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:04,305
And this is our attic.

501
00:35:05,486 --> 00:35:06,247
Okay, great.

502
00:35:06,627 --> 00:35:08,489
Yeah, that that does look different.

503
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:10,050
So that's helpful.

504
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,012
Yeah.

505
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:15,734
And so yeah, hi, Calvin.

506
00:35:15,774 --> 00:35:16,195
Thank you.

507
00:35:16,475 --> 00:35:16,855
Sorry.

508
00:35:19,537 --> 00:35:22,560
Did you want to go into any other area of the plan?

509
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:29,890
Am I correctly understanding it's the third floor where all the work is happening?

510
00:35:31,211 --> 00:35:34,612
Yes, the third floor is where all the work is happening that we need permits for.

511
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:39,214
We're doing some remodeling of bedrooms and bathrooms, but that's it.

512
00:35:39,755 --> 00:35:42,056
I think we can stay zoomed in on there then.

513
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:45,397
Any questions from the board so far?

514
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:16,830
Mr. Chair, yeah May yeah, just if we could Reduce what it is that the applicant is seeking the variance and the special permit I'm having a little computer issue where I can't pull up.

515
00:36:17,651 --> 00:36:26,416
Yeah, so essentially So that the house is existing non-conforming and I

516
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:43,722
the even at two and a half floors, due to the position of the house on the lot, it was gonna require a special permit with no substantial detriment standard.

517
00:36:43,822 --> 00:36:54,390
And then after the building commissioner clarified that some of the low ceiling height space on the prior

518
00:36:55,705 --> 00:37:07,114
plan was still going to count and that it qualified as a third floor anyway, the applicant decided to just make that space more functional.

519
00:37:07,534 --> 00:37:17,441
So in this zone, going from two and a half floor to three floor, that requires a dimensional variance.

520
00:37:17,842 --> 00:37:24,947
So it's a variance for being three floors and a special permit for extending existing nonconformity.

521
00:37:26,265 --> 00:37:29,548
Thank you.

522
00:37:29,568 --> 00:37:31,549
Other questions from the board?

523
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:51,886
So one thing I'll say, I just want to make sure we talk about it before the board deliberates.

524
00:37:53,741 --> 00:38:14,935
With a variance, the board has to connect something about the shape, topography, or soil conditions of the land or structures that would present a hardship if the zoning ordinance were literally enforced.

525
00:38:16,256 --> 00:38:21,019
And so here, for the variance specifically,

526
00:38:24,443 --> 00:38:36,231
essentially, without the relief, you'd be limited to, I think it was about, what, like 450 foot, something like that.

527
00:38:38,913 --> 00:38:50,962
And so for the variant standard, you need to connect the need for that additional half story to something about

528
00:38:51,845 --> 00:38:55,510
The lot or something unusual about the lot or structure.

529
00:38:55,590 --> 00:39:01,657
So for example, you could point out that the shape of your lot is unusual because it's kind of at this.

530
00:39:04,127 --> 00:39:21,931
Herbie Bend, which contributes to the nonconforming nature of the existing structure, or you could point to how the footprint of the existing structure limits the size of a half story that you could build up there relative to some of your neighbors.

531
00:39:21,971 --> 00:39:29,112
But you have to make some argument to connect the hardship to the

532
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:31,174
the structure or the lot.

533
00:39:32,154 --> 00:39:37,377
So what's the hardship in this case from your perspective?

534
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,438
Yeah, I'm happy to answer that.

535
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:45,482
The hardship is that our lot is undersized for what it was technically supposed to be allotted for.

536
00:39:46,522 --> 00:39:52,245
We can't build into our yard without losing a lot of yard to gain substantial space.

537
00:39:52,406 --> 00:39:53,886
Our yard's already very small.

538
00:39:54,867 --> 00:39:56,748
We're also on a corner.

539
00:39:57,373 --> 00:40:00,554
if you could see on our plot map.

540
00:40:00,594 --> 00:40:04,616
We can't really build out because then we'd be out onto the sidewalk and that wouldn't work.

541
00:40:06,577 --> 00:40:18,942
The only other place where we'd be able to build out to is our driveway, which if we do that, we lose our parking and then we would have to park on the street, which would affect flow of traffic because we're on a corner that actually gets fairly busy.

542
00:40:20,143 --> 00:40:25,385
For us really to have appreciable living space that we can make our home long-term,

543
00:40:26,276 --> 00:40:32,023
and we would like to stay and make our homework for us, it's to build up.

544
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:40,975
And so that's why we would appreciate the relief from the zoning variants or regulations.

545
00:40:41,836 --> 00:40:42,717
Okay, thank you.

546
00:40:43,017 --> 00:40:44,419
Other questions from the board?

547
00:40:54,087 --> 00:41:01,991
All right, I'm not seeing any, so I'll go ahead and open it up to members of the public.

548
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:06,554
If you're a member of the public and would like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

549
00:41:06,634 --> 00:41:12,477
You can raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera, raise your hand, you can type in the chat, or you can email Dennis.

550
00:41:18,984 --> 00:41:28,993
By the way, the board did get a letter, which is in the public record from the neighbor directly abutting, stating that they have no objection to these plans.

551
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:39,322
Yeah.

552
00:41:39,342 --> 00:41:42,565
Lucy, can you stop screen sharing, just so it's easier to see?

553
00:41:43,927 --> 00:41:44,387
Thank you.

554
00:41:48,787 --> 00:41:53,809
All right, I'm not seeing any members of the public, any other members of the public that would like to speak on this matter.

555
00:41:55,449 --> 00:42:00,291
Chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

556
00:42:04,412 --> 00:42:04,693
Motion.

557
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:06,173
Do I have a second?

558
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:10,054
Second.

559
00:42:10,074 --> 00:42:12,335
All right, we're going to take a roll call.

560
00:42:12,415 --> 00:42:12,715
Jim?

561
00:42:13,356 --> 00:42:13,456
Aye.

562
00:42:14,216 --> 00:42:14,516
Andre?

563
00:42:19,558 --> 00:42:21,500
Um, I saw you say I Andre.

564
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:28,848
I think your second thing dropped, but, um, Chris, I, uh, event.

565
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:29,969
Hi.

566
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:30,890
Hi.

567
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,173
All right.

568
00:42:33,233 --> 00:42:34,434
You're now deliberating.

569
00:42:49,343 --> 00:42:57,868
Yeah, I think there is hardship, and then I think that there is a legitimate reason for this build-out.

570
00:42:58,188 --> 00:43:02,530
So I would tend to agree with the applicant.

571
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:07,553
All right.

572
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:08,293
Thank you, Mary.

573
00:43:08,573 --> 00:43:09,794
Other thoughts from the board?

574
00:43:12,388 --> 00:43:17,492
would just add that it's not varying far from the original design.

575
00:43:17,552 --> 00:43:23,076
It's upgrading, updating, and looks pretty similar to the surrounding area.

576
00:43:35,585 --> 00:43:39,368
I would say that due to the shape of their lot, there are limited

577
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,301
what they can do for expansion or additions.

578
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:53,962
So that satisfies my, I'm satisfied, I should say, I guess, with that criteria.

579
00:43:56,163 --> 00:43:56,803
Thank you.

580
00:43:57,223 --> 00:43:57,743
Other thoughts?

581
00:43:58,623 --> 00:44:02,884
I agree with my colleagues as well.

582
00:44:05,504 --> 00:44:07,685
Yeah, just chiming in to say I concur.

583
00:44:07,725 --> 00:44:10,025
The lot's certainly unusually shaped.

584
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:20,607
And given the footprint of the structure and its position on the lot, there's not a lot of other options to extend the house.

585
00:44:20,767 --> 00:44:28,309
So in this case, I see the hardship and I also don't see a substantial detriment.

586
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:34,510
Certainly comforting to know that the immediate abutters don't object to the plans.

587
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:38,371
All right.

588
00:44:38,431 --> 00:44:38,751
Well,

589
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:44,434
If there's nothing else from the board, Chair awaits a motion.

590
00:44:44,514 --> 00:44:56,123
So we're going to have to weigh in both on the special permit for extending existing nonconformity and then the variance with respect to the number of floors.

591
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:22,571
So for example, if someone wants to make a motion to approve the variance for number of floors and approve the special permit, that would grant the applicant the relief they're seeking.

592
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:25,853
Can you hear me?

593
00:45:26,913 --> 00:45:27,774
We can hear you now, yes.

594
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:29,415
Okay, great.

595
00:45:30,415 --> 00:45:31,976
Should we do two separate motions?

596
00:45:33,757 --> 00:45:34,077
Up to you.

597
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:46,792
Okay, I'd like to approve the variance for the third floor for the Myrtle Street project as well as the special permit.

598
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:48,973
Do I have a second?

599
00:45:48,993 --> 00:45:50,453
I'll second.

600
00:45:50,473 --> 00:45:53,534
All right, let's take a roll call.

601
00:45:53,554 --> 00:45:53,854
Yvette?

602
00:45:55,055 --> 00:45:55,235
Aye.

603
00:45:55,835 --> 00:45:56,235
Mary?

604
00:45:56,976 --> 00:45:57,116
Aye.

605
00:45:57,956 --> 00:45:58,276
Chris?

606
00:45:58,976 --> 00:45:59,116
Aye.

607
00:45:59,977 --> 00:46:00,217
Andre?

608
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:00,377
Aye.

609
00:46:04,788 --> 00:46:04,888
Aye.

610
00:46:06,049 --> 00:46:06,469
And Jim?

611
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:07,350
Aye.

612
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:09,071
All right.

613
00:46:09,091 --> 00:46:09,931
You have your variance.

614
00:46:09,971 --> 00:46:10,832
You have your special permit.

615
00:46:12,553 --> 00:46:14,034
Wow, thank you so much.

616
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:14,995
Best news ever.

617
00:46:15,175 --> 00:46:15,515
Thank you.

618
00:46:15,555 --> 00:46:26,863
All right, and Lucy, I know I've said this already twice, but I'll say it again just because, just to, so what happens is I'll write up the decision and it'll get checked by our legal counsel.

619
00:46:27,483 --> 00:46:31,065
And then once it's okay by them, it gets signed by the members of the board members.

620
00:46:31,566 --> 00:46:33,227
At that point, it gets filed in the clerk's office.

621
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:39,453
That point there's a 20 day waiting period for an appeal in case an appeal comes in and we can't get anything for them.

622
00:46:39,813 --> 00:46:51,439
When the appeals period is over, go down to the clerk's office, you'll get a letter from them, take that to the Middlesex Registry and you just file that and then you can come right back and get your permit that day.

623
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,921
Okay, sounds good.

624
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:56,982
And if you have any questions, yeah, yeah.

625
00:46:57,162 --> 00:46:59,423
When you're going through this, just don't hesitate to stop by.

626
00:46:59,463 --> 00:47:00,983
I'll help you through the process.

627
00:47:01,243 --> 00:47:08,486
I'll try to remember all that, but yeah, it sounds like there's about a 20 days at fastest and then there's filings and all that, but yeah, we'll be in touch.

628
00:47:08,946 --> 00:47:09,947
No, this is wonderful news.

629
00:47:10,007 --> 00:47:10,907
Thank you so, so much.

630
00:47:11,367 --> 00:47:12,167
I really appreciate it.

631
00:47:12,507 --> 00:47:12,888
Thank you.

632
00:47:13,128 --> 00:47:13,268
Bye.

633
00:47:13,328 --> 00:47:14,288
All right.

634
00:47:15,008 --> 00:47:15,369
What's next?

635
00:47:24,186 --> 00:47:25,647
357 Riverside Avenue.

636
00:47:26,248 --> 00:47:34,354
Applicant and owner David Beaman to install a new curb cut and driveway in the front yard of the property, which is not allowed for the City of Memphis zoning ordinance.

637
00:47:34,374 --> 00:47:37,496
All right, I see we have David Beaman on the call.

638
00:47:37,857 --> 00:47:38,517
Hello and welcome.

639
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:41,740
You're on mute.

640
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:47,144
You're still on mute.

641
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:54,587
Yeah.

642
00:47:54,768 --> 00:47:55,808
Hi, I'm Dave.

643
00:47:55,988 --> 00:48:00,072
I, uh, we have no parking at our house.

644
00:48:00,432 --> 00:48:04,896
Uh, I can show you a photo if you want, or yeah, that'd be great.

645
00:48:05,436 --> 00:48:06,697
Okay.

646
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:07,037
Same day.

647
00:48:07,077 --> 00:48:11,301
We'll just give you a verbal and you're all set now.

648
00:48:12,692 --> 00:48:12,972
Okay.

649
00:48:14,033 --> 00:48:14,173
Okay.

650
00:48:14,253 --> 00:48:15,533
What do I just scan it in?

651
00:48:16,133 --> 00:48:25,017
I mean, uh, you just, if you have, if you have the photo up on your screen, you can hit share and then images will pop up and you can just share that photo.

652
00:48:25,577 --> 00:48:31,579
Or if you want, if I can call up and what I'll call it now is the, uh, yep.

653
00:48:31,819 --> 00:48:32,099
Okay.

654
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:35,561
So if you do, uh, on the bottom, there's a little green button says share and.

655
00:48:43,372 --> 00:48:45,113
Where's the button again?

656
00:48:45,353 --> 00:48:46,293
It's at the bottom of this.

657
00:48:46,613 --> 00:48:49,514
It's on the bottom of along the, uh, tools.

658
00:48:49,534 --> 00:48:50,955
There's it's a button that says share.

659
00:48:51,015 --> 00:48:51,595
You should have it.

660
00:48:55,997 --> 00:48:56,257
Yeah.

661
00:48:56,957 --> 00:49:02,139
On mine, it shows up as a green rectangle with an up arrow.

662
00:49:06,521 --> 00:49:08,342
Oh, it's over there.

663
00:49:08,522 --> 00:49:08,802
Okay.

664
00:49:08,822 --> 00:49:09,002
Yeah.

665
00:49:11,343 --> 00:49:11,603
Oops.

666
00:49:13,914 --> 00:49:15,515
Okay, who do I share it to, though?

667
00:49:16,055 --> 00:49:17,796
If you just hit share, it should share it to everybody.

668
00:49:18,737 --> 00:49:21,078
Okay, but the share button's on the Zoom.

669
00:49:24,881 --> 00:49:33,026
The other thing I could do is if I could just call up on Street View and sort of show it that way, they might give a... I think that'll work.

670
00:49:34,008 --> 00:49:34,548
Yeah.

671
00:49:34,648 --> 00:49:34,969
Okay.

672
00:49:35,049 --> 00:49:35,509
Yeah.

673
00:49:35,629 --> 00:49:38,030
I had a picture of my car parked in front.

674
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:44,013
So you can kind of see the problem, but, uh, yeah, I don't see a share button anymore.

675
00:49:45,494 --> 00:49:47,235
Let me, uh, no worries.

676
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:49,336
Dennis will bring it up on street view.

677
00:49:49,916 --> 00:49:50,196
Okay.

678
00:49:51,117 --> 00:49:53,238
Sometimes you have to bring the mouse all the way down.

679
00:49:56,019 --> 00:49:57,260
Oh, now I see the share button.

680
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:57,960
Okay.

681
00:49:58,881 --> 00:49:59,761
Feel free to give it a try.

682
00:49:59,821 --> 00:50:03,023
What popped up when, once I got rid of the photo, that's, that's weird.

683
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:05,370
OK, share first.

684
00:50:16,534 --> 00:50:16,854
See it?

685
00:50:17,794 --> 00:50:18,755
Yes, we see it.

686
00:50:19,295 --> 00:50:19,575
OK.

687
00:50:21,035 --> 00:50:24,657
OK, so there's what we're doing to unload

688
00:50:27,058 --> 00:50:29,039
groceries and supplies.

689
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,862
And as you can see, there's plenty of room in front of the house for a parking spot.

690
00:50:35,063 --> 00:50:39,366
There is no room on either side of the house for a driveway.

691
00:50:39,986 --> 00:50:53,635
So my plan is to tear down the front porch, put the stairs going sideways to traverse the front of the house, and then put pavers

692
00:50:55,238 --> 00:51:01,240
semi-permeable or permeable pavers in front of the house.

693
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,580
So I have a place where I can parallel park.

694
00:51:04,941 --> 00:51:12,283
And right now it's a real problem, as you can see with, you know, safety and that's our main concern.

695
00:51:15,464 --> 00:51:15,784
All right.

696
00:51:16,804 --> 00:51:17,644
I'll get rid of that.

697
00:51:18,044 --> 00:51:18,404
Okay.

698
00:51:18,885 --> 00:51:23,006
We've, by the way, I forgot to say that's the same coding members.

699
00:51:24,295 --> 00:51:26,356
Do you have questions from members of the board?

700
00:51:30,518 --> 00:51:32,619
I guess I should say I'm looking for a variance.

701
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,420
Yeah, that's right.

702
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:40,783
So the proposed parking is in the front yard setback.

703
00:51:43,624 --> 00:51:46,686
And so that's not allowed under the ordinance.

704
00:51:46,746 --> 00:51:49,267
So a variance is required to put it there.

705
00:51:50,132 --> 00:51:54,554
Yeah, I need a variance of about four feet apparently.

706
00:51:56,235 --> 00:52:01,557
The front yard's currently set back 15 feet minus the front porch.

707
00:52:02,978 --> 00:52:13,983
The new porch is gonna be four feet wide, allowing for a nine foot wide parking spot parallel to the street with a 16 foot curb cut.

708
00:52:16,565 --> 00:52:17,405
Questions from the board.

709
00:52:20,877 --> 00:52:24,559
Do you have a picture of the plan over the proposed plan?

710
00:52:24,999 --> 00:52:28,781
Or is the proposed plan to remove part of the sidewalk?

711
00:52:31,242 --> 00:52:33,823
Right, well, the variance is for a curb cut.

712
00:52:37,465 --> 00:52:38,465
Here, I'll show you that.

713
00:52:38,866 --> 00:52:39,326
I can do that.

714
00:52:39,386 --> 00:52:40,186
I got that right now.

715
00:52:40,626 --> 00:52:41,407
OK, thanks.

716
00:52:41,687 --> 00:52:42,627
Yeah, there it is.

717
00:52:44,348 --> 00:52:45,889
Sorry, didn't get too much.

718
00:52:56,701 --> 00:53:01,204
So this was the sidewalk that we saw in the picture?

719
00:53:01,644 --> 00:53:02,265
Yeah, that's right.

720
00:53:02,525 --> 00:53:03,986
This is a sidewalk right here.

721
00:53:04,006 --> 00:53:04,706
Right here.

722
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:05,326
That's a sidewalk.

723
00:53:05,466 --> 00:53:05,827
OK.

724
00:53:06,047 --> 00:53:06,247
Yeah.

725
00:53:07,728 --> 00:53:08,848
Or right here, actually.

726
00:53:09,649 --> 00:53:10,489
Yeah.

727
00:53:10,689 --> 00:53:13,091
And this was the yard?

728
00:53:13,351 --> 00:53:16,493
I'm trying to look at the picture.

729
00:53:16,853 --> 00:53:20,055
This is the yard right here where you see the car parked?

730
00:53:23,894 --> 00:53:26,235
I don't see that in the photo.

731
00:53:27,335 --> 00:53:29,056
I'm looking at the photo on my phone.

732
00:53:29,556 --> 00:53:31,737
Oh, that's because there is no yard, really.

733
00:53:31,777 --> 00:53:34,757
There's just front steps going down to the sidewalk.

734
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:49,262
I'm going to remove those steps and have a stairway going down the front of the house, parallel to the house, not coming directly at you.

735
00:53:50,523 --> 00:53:51,403
And a smaller,

736
00:53:53,448 --> 00:53:57,370
a smaller porch around four by six.

737
00:54:00,252 --> 00:54:06,375
These are just preliminary plans for the variance.

738
00:54:07,076 --> 00:54:13,239
I can submit other plans for how the house is going to look later on if I get the variance.

739
00:54:15,707 --> 00:54:20,150
So this is the porch, right, from looking at the picture.

740
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:25,914
This is the porch, and this looks like a fence.

741
00:54:25,974 --> 00:54:28,036
This will be the top of the porch right here.

742
00:54:29,677 --> 00:54:30,737
See this little square?

743
00:54:30,757 --> 00:54:31,718
Yeah.

744
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:34,480
These are the steps going down.

745
00:54:35,901 --> 00:54:40,524
This will be all pavers made to look nice.

746
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,721
And then I'm going to have granite installed around the edges.

747
00:54:52,223 --> 00:54:56,144
So the car will be parallel to the front steps, right?

748
00:54:56,384 --> 00:54:57,204
That's the car.

749
00:54:57,604 --> 00:54:58,164
Exactly.

750
00:54:58,184 --> 00:54:59,504
So this will be the parking lot.

751
00:54:59,524 --> 00:55:00,405
This is the car, yeah.

752
00:55:00,825 --> 00:55:07,746
And this will be the entrance will be... And the entrance is right... This is the river.

753
00:55:08,106 --> 00:55:09,947
This is the entrance to the house right here.

754
00:55:11,486 --> 00:55:12,888
You see my arrow?

755
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:17,192
Yeah, but I don't see that in the picture.

756
00:55:17,933 --> 00:55:18,974
I'm just trying to figure out.

757
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:21,917
Oh, that's because I'm going to take the porch down.

758
00:55:21,957 --> 00:55:24,320
I'm going to remove it in the picture.

759
00:55:26,642 --> 00:55:32,208
The way it is now, I'm taking that porch down to allow room for the car.

760
00:55:34,557 --> 00:55:36,018
and put a smaller porch.

761
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,059
And you're taking the stairs out.

762
00:55:38,219 --> 00:55:44,521
And then, so this is Riverside.

763
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,762
Yeah, this is Riverside here.

764
00:55:46,902 --> 00:55:54,106
Okay, and then this is the cut to the... That's my side yard right there.

765
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:56,287
And here's the other side yard.

766
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:01,329
It's about three feet on either side.

767
00:56:02,049 --> 00:56:03,790
Yeah, so Mary, in the picture,

768
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:11,665
there's the car, it's partially on the sidewalk, which now the curb cut in that position.

769
00:56:12,405 --> 00:56:19,710
And then in the plot plan, there was kind of a faint outline of a staircase.

770
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:29,596
So there was some landscaping and a staircase and that all gets removed to make room for the car.

771
00:56:30,657 --> 00:56:30,957
Okay.

772
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:31,357
Okay.

773
00:56:31,417 --> 00:56:31,818
I see.

774
00:56:31,898 --> 00:56:32,238
I see.

775
00:56:32,258 --> 00:56:32,518
Thank you.

776
00:56:34,762 --> 00:56:47,973
Am I correctly understanding the reason for the size of the curb cut is because it's parallel to the house, so if it was a smaller curb cut, it just wouldn't be practical to get in and out?

777
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:51,216
Yeah, it's for ease of coming in and out of the traffic.

778
00:56:52,657 --> 00:57:00,104
Originally, I wanted to make it 20 feet, but the building inspector revised that to 16, so there would be

779
00:57:02,102 --> 00:57:05,185
point of view, better viewing coming in and out.

780
00:57:07,287 --> 00:57:13,512
Apparently, you know, there's, you must have done some, some work on that.

781
00:57:15,821 --> 00:57:17,481
To figure it out, but.

782
00:57:18,582 --> 00:57:18,842
That.

783
00:57:20,342 --> 00:57:22,783
Unfortunately, I have to take down those.

784
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:26,984
Those grapevines, but it's going to have to be done.

785
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:29,044
It's it's really for us.

786
00:57:29,124 --> 00:57:32,465
I mean, we're we're both over 70 years of age and we.

787
00:57:34,265 --> 00:57:36,926
We're we're doing this for convenience and safety.

788
00:57:38,006 --> 00:57:40,167
And so it benefits both us and.

789
00:57:40,567 --> 00:57:40,687
And.

790
00:57:42,678 --> 00:57:47,121
and cars going by and pedestrians going down the sidewalk.

791
00:57:48,321 --> 00:57:53,865
Because as you can see, we're unloading groceries several times a week.

792
00:57:56,986 --> 00:57:59,648
Anyway, that's my plea.

793
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:02,230
Thank you.

794
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:04,031
Other questions?

795
00:58:07,513 --> 00:58:10,254
You can't actually physically fit two cars though, right?

796
00:58:10,274 --> 00:58:11,115
You can only do the one.

797
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:13,079
It would only be one.

798
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:18,481
Yeah, we only have one car anyway, but yeah.

799
00:58:18,501 --> 00:58:21,343
It would be structured in such a way that you couldn't really.

800
00:58:22,723 --> 00:58:25,764
Go up vertically, you'd have to go parallel.

801
00:58:26,845 --> 00:58:30,846
And the idea is to drive in and then back back up.

802
00:58:32,187 --> 00:58:35,348
The whole front yard is going to be paved, so with pavers.

803
00:58:36,749 --> 00:58:38,889
It would be a lot better looking than what's there now.

804
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:40,410
I assure you.

805
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:52,401
Mr. Beeman, do you anticipate being able to screen the car a little bit when it's parked so that it's not just right next to the sidewalk?

806
00:58:53,522 --> 00:58:55,623
Yeah.

807
00:58:57,865 --> 00:59:04,030
There's going to be a nine-foot space and the car is only approximately seven foot wide.

808
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:16,604
But I mean, will you still have a fence screening part of the car when it's parked?

809
00:59:18,605 --> 00:59:22,447
Well, that would be a nice fun.

810
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:28,070
I would do that if I could, because it'd be nice to hide the car.

811
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:29,531
We could plant.

812
00:59:33,299 --> 00:59:39,044
The only problem with doing something like that is that it would obscure the view coming in and out.

813
00:59:39,064 --> 00:59:40,145
That's the only problem.

814
00:59:40,225 --> 00:59:58,182
So now we don't have any plans of building any structures on other than along the sides is going to be some granite work done to allow access to the backyard.

815
01:00:08,128 --> 01:00:09,968
All right, other questions from the board?

816
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:20,751
Being done, I will open it up to public comment.

817
01:00:20,811 --> 01:00:24,292
If you're a member of the public and would like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

818
01:00:24,312 --> 01:00:28,053
You can raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera and raise your hand.

819
01:00:28,073 --> 01:00:29,513
You can type in the chat or you can email.

820
01:00:43,657 --> 01:00:46,699
not seeing any members of the public who would like to speak on this matter.

821
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:52,623
Uh, so Chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

822
01:00:54,184 --> 01:00:54,565
I moved.

823
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:55,765
Oh, second.

824
01:00:57,907 --> 01:00:58,287
Second.

825
01:00:59,068 --> 01:00:59,248
All right.

826
01:00:59,268 --> 01:01:00,689
We're going to take a roll call.

827
01:01:00,769 --> 01:01:01,129
Jim?

828
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:02,030
Aye.

829
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:03,131
Andre?

830
01:01:03,151 --> 01:01:05,772
Chris?

831
01:01:06,293 --> 01:01:06,393
Aye.

832
01:01:07,153 --> 01:01:07,594
Mary?

833
01:01:07,614 --> 01:01:08,434
Aye.

834
01:01:08,454 --> 01:01:09,415
Yvette?

835
01:01:10,636 --> 01:01:10,776
Aye.

836
01:01:11,727 --> 01:01:12,927
All right, we're now deliberating.

837
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,887
What do you think, folks?

838
01:01:21,709 --> 01:01:27,530
Well, I think if I could go first, Mr. Chair.

839
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:36,311
I have concerns in that there are a lot of fairly decent sidewalk traffic here.

840
01:01:37,812 --> 01:01:40,052
Ironically, placing the,

841
01:01:41,923 --> 01:01:56,190
driveway or the car parallel to the road may actually be safer than perpendicular to the road, because the driver would have a clearer view of pedestrians.

842
01:01:56,310 --> 01:02:03,214
And pedestrians may or may not have a clearer view of the car coming in and out.

843
01:02:04,534 --> 01:02:05,455
But I think they would.

844
01:02:07,236 --> 01:02:11,158
So we already have many, if not

845
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:31,321
least a dozen, maybe more parking spaces that are perpendicular and cause some problems with school children walking across the backs of cars that are backing out and anyone else for that matter.

846
01:02:32,142 --> 01:02:41,109
So, so it's kind of ironic, but I think the parallel parking in the front is actually an improvement on that.

847
01:02:42,082 --> 01:02:42,342
point.

848
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:47,288
Thank you, Chris.

849
01:02:47,368 --> 01:02:48,709
Other thoughts from the board?

850
01:02:52,854 --> 01:02:53,234
Andre, go ahead.

851
01:02:58,333 --> 01:03:04,058
I mean, I'll just, I'll say that I always hate to put parking in the front yard.

852
01:03:05,819 --> 01:03:11,544
This property has absolutely no other place to put it.

853
01:03:13,545 --> 01:03:18,626
No possibility of putting a car anywhere else.

854
01:03:19,527 --> 01:03:21,707
And it's a very busy street.

855
01:03:21,767 --> 01:03:24,148
So there's no on street parking option.

856
01:03:24,648 --> 01:03:30,810
And even around the corner on the side streets, there's almost no on street parking option.

857
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:31,390
So

858
01:03:33,045 --> 01:03:46,963
You know, despite serious reservations, I would be inclined to make an exception so that, you know, this family can stay in their home.

859
01:03:50,406 --> 01:03:57,652
but I wish there was enough, there's not even enough room in the front to really even screen the car, which is disappointing.

860
01:03:58,052 --> 01:04:02,856
So I guess one other question I have, if it's okay to ask Mr. Beam in this.

861
01:04:03,296 --> 01:04:07,680
So there is in the front yard, there's two steps up to the front yard.

862
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,764
So are you taking out the retaining wall and regrading it to the level of the sidewalk?

863
01:04:14,005 --> 01:04:19,990
It's going to be graded to the appropriate slope, but it's going to be graded all the way up to the house, yeah.

864
01:04:23,912 --> 01:04:29,897
It's going to be sloped at, I'm not sure what the angle is, but there's for drainage purposes.

865
01:04:29,917 --> 01:04:35,863
Okay, thank you.

866
01:04:35,883 --> 01:04:40,827
All right, other thoughts from the board.

867
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:56,642
I'm just going to add that I think it's always good when folks are trying to stay in their homes.

868
01:04:56,702 --> 01:04:58,542
And this is like a quality of life.

869
01:04:58,582 --> 01:05:06,665
So in addition to it not being detrimental to the neighborhood, because it's not as if they're taking away parking, there's no parking on that street anyway.

870
01:05:08,406 --> 01:05:17,369
So he's adding value, if anything, to his home, which I think only helps the neighborhood as a whole.

871
01:05:18,792 --> 01:05:21,836
And that's the way it is, and that's in that neighborhood.

872
01:05:22,396 --> 01:05:27,421
It's tight, and we have to figure it out the best way possible to live.

873
01:05:27,501 --> 01:05:31,986
So I think it makes sense to put a parking spot in that way there.

874
01:05:35,069 --> 01:05:35,629
Thanks for that.

875
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:37,131
Other thoughts from the board?

876
01:05:40,786 --> 01:05:44,929
Mr. Chair, if I could follow up on what Andre just mentioned.

877
01:05:46,069 --> 01:05:55,395
I guess now thinking about it, if the slope is too severe, there'll be a problem with the car slipping in snow or something like that.

878
01:05:55,455 --> 01:06:09,523
So I'd like to see the building inspector, I don't know if we can condition this, but to make sure that the slope is appropriate for being so close to the sidewalk.

879
01:06:11,157 --> 01:06:16,940
So we can't condition on some downstream approval.

880
01:06:18,961 --> 01:06:29,568
If it triggers something in the building code, then it wouldn't be permittable anyway.

881
01:06:29,588 --> 01:06:32,449
I mean, Dennis, is this something you can speak to?

882
01:06:32,949 --> 01:06:36,171
Yeah, so all curb cuts are approved by the city engineer.

883
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:39,353
So the city engineer would have to go over these plans and approve them.

884
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:52,571
I have confidence that anything in issues with drainage, I think the other thing is that Mr. Beaman mentioned that they're putting permeable pavers in, which actually will help prevent some of overflow of water.

885
01:06:52,611 --> 01:06:58,455
That's what we're always trying to ask folks to put permeable things in in situations like this, which

886
01:06:59,075 --> 01:07:03,659
Hopefully also sort of minimize the water going into the streets.

887
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:12,126
We want to try to keep rainwater from going on the street, but I think between the city engineer review of the of the driveway of the curb cut.

888
01:07:12,787 --> 01:07:15,569
And, you know, he's not usually in these situations.

889
01:07:15,589 --> 01:07:16,790
He's not just going to look at the curb cut.

890
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:18,011
He's going to look at this.

891
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:24,863
Permit has to go through his office anyway, so not just for the curb cut, but the actual.

892
01:07:24,883 --> 01:07:28,785
Pretty much all types of these works will get approved by the city engineer.

893
01:07:28,805 --> 01:07:30,146
So I think between that and.

894
01:07:31,887 --> 01:07:39,472
If I may say something, I'm hiring a general contractor to do the work, so he'll make sure that all of the.

895
01:07:40,493 --> 01:07:43,675
Appropriate building codes are up to code and.

896
01:07:45,656 --> 01:07:48,118
It's going to look nice too, I guarantee you.

897
01:07:48,399 --> 01:07:49,820
I'm going to spend money on this.

898
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:55,384
I'm not going to just pave it like you see elsewhere on Riverside Avenue.

899
01:07:55,464 --> 01:07:56,865
I'm going to make it look nice.

900
01:07:57,686 --> 01:08:01,149
I've got a hip roof idea for the porch.

901
01:08:01,229 --> 01:08:03,210
I think it's going to look really beautiful.

902
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:09,475
It'll actually add to the ambience of Medford Park.

903
01:08:11,229 --> 01:08:14,790
Yeah, Mr. Chair, just to conclude my thought on that.

904
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:21,652
Yeah, I have confidence in the city staff to do that.

905
01:08:21,692 --> 01:08:32,695
I guess I was speaking not to the sidewalk or the curb cut, but the actual property that we're, the property bounds that we're discussing.

906
01:08:34,834 --> 01:08:41,317
But yes, I guess that that would also apply any runoff and so forth onto the sidewalk.

907
01:08:42,998 --> 01:08:43,318
Thank you.

908
01:08:47,981 --> 01:08:48,581
Great.

909
01:08:48,761 --> 01:09:04,409
So I'm not voting, but I'll just chime in to say, yeah, when I first saw the plans, I didn't love them, but this certainly is an unusual lot for the neighborhood, like all of the other

910
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:21,143
houses seem to have driveways either because they have a wider lot with enough space for one or they happen to be on a side street when they have a driveway on the side street.

911
01:09:21,263 --> 01:09:24,764
So this one, there really is no other option.

912
01:09:24,824 --> 01:09:29,585
It's either a space here or none at all.

913
01:09:30,505 --> 01:09:34,846
It's not immediately clear to me what the strategy has been up until this point, not that

914
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:42,295
I need to know, but certainly it does seem like the shape of the lot presents a hardship in this case.

915
01:09:42,315 --> 01:09:46,958
All right.

916
01:09:47,778 --> 01:09:53,202
Chair awaits a motion on the variance for parking in the front yard.

917
01:09:54,923 --> 01:09:57,784
And for the, I guess it's an oversized curb cut as well.

918
01:09:57,885 --> 01:09:58,505
Is that right, Dennis?

919
01:10:01,115 --> 01:10:08,642
Actually, no, curb cut widths are 20 feet in residential zones.

920
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:12,585
So single family one, single family two, and general residence.

921
01:10:12,806 --> 01:10:14,307
And so they're 20 feet.

922
01:10:15,508 --> 01:10:19,852
So just for parking in the front yard, carry weight to motion on the variance request.

923
01:10:22,878 --> 01:10:34,888
So, Mr. Chair, I have a question if this board's approval will be subject to the city engineers and the building commissioner, right, for this project?

924
01:10:35,409 --> 01:10:49,341
We technically know from a legal standpoint, so there's no downstream approval that our variance is contingent upon, but this plan to fully execute upon it does require

925
01:10:50,581 --> 01:10:53,323
a permit from the city engineer, if that's what you're asking.

926
01:10:55,003 --> 01:10:55,484
Okay, great.

927
01:10:55,684 --> 01:11:04,168
The variance for the parking in the front yard, that one, the city engineer doesn't have any say in where the buck stops here, so to speak.

928
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:10,851
And what about the curb cut?

929
01:11:10,911 --> 01:11:12,792
That's what the city engineers?

930
01:11:13,233 --> 01:11:14,953
The city engineer has to approve that.

931
01:11:15,014 --> 01:11:17,655
So we're not, our variance

932
01:11:18,385 --> 01:11:21,267
vote here is not with respect to the curb cut.

933
01:11:21,327 --> 01:11:38,576
So if something about that curb cut that doesn't meet the city's standards and expectation, then the city engineer is still, he may not allow it.

934
01:11:38,596 --> 01:11:40,457
We're just voting on the parking in the front yard.

935
01:11:41,438 --> 01:11:41,878
Okay, great.

936
01:11:41,918 --> 01:11:42,298
Thank you.

937
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:44,379
Right.

938
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:49,783
Keeping that in mind, Chair awaits a motion on the variance application.

939
01:11:57,828 --> 01:11:58,768
I can't hear you.

940
01:11:58,908 --> 01:12:00,990
Can you hear me now?

941
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:01,550
Yeah.

942
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:02,211
Okay.

943
01:12:02,271 --> 01:12:08,855
Motion to approve the variance for 357 Riverside Ave for the front yard parking.

944
01:12:09,195 --> 01:12:12,477
And the way that it is written, it does say curb cut in the application.

945
01:12:12,517 --> 01:12:14,218
So I'm going to say that as well.

946
01:12:14,679 --> 01:12:14,919
Okay.

947
01:12:15,691 --> 01:12:16,231
We have a second?

948
01:12:16,812 --> 01:12:17,352
I'll second.

949
01:12:17,892 --> 01:12:19,433
We're going to take a roll call.

950
01:12:19,834 --> 01:12:20,314
Mary?

951
01:12:20,334 --> 01:12:21,194
Aye.

952
01:12:21,855 --> 01:12:22,175
Yvette?

953
01:12:23,396 --> 01:12:23,536
Aye.

954
01:12:24,036 --> 01:12:24,416
Chris?

955
01:12:27,078 --> 01:12:29,479
Aye.

956
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:30,680
Jim?

957
01:12:31,361 --> 01:12:31,501
Aye.

958
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:32,461
Andre?

959
01:12:34,763 --> 01:12:35,003
Aye.

960
01:12:35,103 --> 01:12:38,365
All right, variance is approved.

961
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,700
So the variance is approved.

962
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:45,761
You have your parking.

963
01:12:47,382 --> 01:12:51,023
And Dave, just to reiterate what I sort of said earlier, I'll write up the decision.

964
01:12:51,043 --> 01:12:57,225
It'll get approved, checked by our legal counsel, get signed, and then it gets filed in the clerk's office.

965
01:12:57,745 --> 01:13:06,127
Once 20 days has passed after it's been in the clerk's office with no appeal, then you just come in, get the letter from them, go to the registry, and

966
01:13:06,567 --> 01:13:07,428
they can get your permit.

967
01:13:07,468 --> 01:13:09,229
But I can talk you through that.

968
01:13:09,249 --> 01:13:12,290
When you come in, if you have any questions, just give me a call.

969
01:13:12,351 --> 01:13:15,813
I can help you out with that process when we get to that point.

970
01:13:16,513 --> 01:13:22,677
Okay, so you'll let me know when it's... I'll let you know when it's filed, and then that'll start the 20-day clock.

971
01:13:22,737 --> 01:13:28,300
And then once those 20 days are over, then you can come on in and I can help you out and show you to the clerk's office and get you the paperwork.

972
01:13:29,453 --> 01:13:35,321
Okay, can I deal with my contractor yet or should I hold off?

973
01:13:36,163 --> 01:13:42,432
You probably can't get the permit until then, so I would, I mean, if part of the work actually.

974
01:13:44,223 --> 01:13:45,523
He's going to file.

975
01:13:45,984 --> 01:13:47,384
Yeah, he's going to file this when we get the approval.

976
01:13:47,404 --> 01:13:52,325
But I'm thinking something like the porch removal and the adding of the stairs has nothing to do with our permit.

977
01:13:52,925 --> 01:13:56,026
So that, I think, can probably get started beforehand.

978
01:13:56,286 --> 01:13:57,627
But it all depends if you file.

979
01:13:57,647 --> 01:13:59,287
Those are probably going to be separate permits.

980
01:13:59,327 --> 01:14:02,408
But have them talk to the building department and sort of see what they can do.

981
01:14:02,468 --> 01:14:08,850
But I think they can probably do some of the work initially just to sort of get things started, if that's easier.

982
01:14:09,490 --> 01:14:09,730
OK.

983
01:14:11,651 --> 01:14:11,971
Great.

984
01:14:12,011 --> 01:14:12,511
Thanks, guys.

985
01:14:13,563 --> 01:14:14,824
All right, thank you, good night.

986
01:14:14,844 --> 01:14:17,727
All right, what's next, Dennis?

987
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,169
All right, 54 Murray Street.

988
01:14:20,469 --> 01:14:30,538
Applicant and owner, Leanne Morgan, to install in addition to 54 Murray Street, creating a side yard setback and extending existing front yard setback nonconformity, which is not allowed per the City of Memphis zoning ordinance.

989
01:14:31,318 --> 01:14:35,142
This will also add a parking space in the front yard, which is not allowed per the City of Memphis zoning ordinance.

990
01:14:35,162 --> 01:14:38,965
All right, thank you, and I see we have Leanne Morgan here.

991
01:14:39,566 --> 01:14:39,866
Welcome.

992
01:14:41,588 --> 01:14:43,709
Yes, and good evening, folks.

993
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,671
Could I get my camera reinstated?

994
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:46,431
Oh, sorry about that.

995
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:47,132
No worries.

996
01:14:51,956 --> 01:14:52,776
Good evening, everybody.

997
01:14:52,796 --> 01:14:55,739
I'm Eric Mayer, counsel for Ms.

998
01:14:55,779 --> 01:14:58,961
Morgan, so I'm going to be here to present on the application here.

999
01:14:59,762 --> 01:15:08,809
Thank you very much for taking your time on what is a very nice evening after a very hot week to talk about this variance application.

1000
01:15:09,884 --> 01:15:14,107
So the purpose of this variance application is really twofold.

1001
01:15:14,127 --> 01:15:16,549
There are two interrelated aspects to it.

1002
01:15:17,329 --> 01:15:29,098
The first is to build a modest 10 by 24 foot addition to the northerly side of the pre-existing non-conforming residence on the property.

1003
01:15:31,423 --> 01:15:42,490
Additional aspect of this variance application is to place an additional off street parking space directly in front of where that 10 by 24 foot addition would be located.

1004
01:15:44,355 --> 01:15:53,259
And as I mentioned, the property has a preexisting nonconforming structure because it is located within the 15 foot front setback.

1005
01:15:53,939 --> 01:16:05,225
The 10 by 24 foot addition would on the backside encroach slightly by about 0.7 feet within the side setback.

1006
01:16:05,785 --> 01:16:12,308
And naturally the addition of the parking space would place some parking in the front setback as well.

1007
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:17,293
The property is somewhat unique compared to the rest of the neighborhood.

1008
01:16:17,533 --> 01:16:20,035
It's in the SF2 zoning district.

1009
01:16:20,675 --> 01:16:28,721
It has 10,776 square feet, and it might be easier to go through this if you could bring up the plot plan.

1010
01:16:29,201 --> 01:16:30,902
If not, I could bring it up on share screen.

1011
01:16:31,623 --> 01:16:33,924
I can do that.

1012
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:36,626
Would it be easier for you to have the share screen or do you just want to bring it up?

1013
01:16:38,258 --> 01:16:39,059
Why don't you bring it up?

1014
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:43,562
It's a fairly simple one, so I don't think I'll have to circle or point to a tremendous amount.

1015
01:16:43,582 --> 01:16:46,004
I'm using a touch screen, so it sometimes gets dicey.

1016
01:16:47,485 --> 01:16:47,646
Okay.

1017
01:16:48,446 --> 01:16:49,067
All right, we'll see it.

1018
01:16:50,268 --> 01:16:50,448
Yes.

1019
01:16:51,489 --> 01:16:52,730
Thank you very much, Mr. McDougall.

1020
01:16:53,931 --> 01:16:55,732
So the property is 10,776 square feet in size.

1021
01:16:55,752 --> 01:16:57,674
It's oversized for the zoning district, which requires 5,000 square feet.

1022
01:17:05,771 --> 01:17:19,797
Unlike other similarly sized properties within the zoning district, it's fairly long and narrow, which has impacted how one can actually build out from the existing single family residence.

1023
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:29,328
and it's not reflected on the plot plan, but the topography of the lot actually increases as you go toward the rear.

1024
01:17:30,029 --> 01:17:30,729
And Ms.

1025
01:17:30,749 --> 01:17:33,732
Morgan is a 20 year resident at this particular residence.

1026
01:17:34,612 --> 01:17:40,037
Previously, she lived at 60 Marie Street, which is the property to the immediate rear for 30 something years.

1027
01:17:40,217 --> 01:17:45,401
So she is a 50 plus year resident of this neighborhood.

1028
01:17:45,901 --> 01:17:50,285
She would tell you that there's a substantial amount of subsurface ledge

1029
01:17:50,945 --> 01:18:00,872
um, to the rear of this property going into the wooded areas that is affected a lot of the lots in this area and will affect where she can build on this particular lot.

1030
01:18:02,392 --> 01:18:17,482
Um, the single family dwelling is presently is 9.7 ft from the property's left sideline, 16.8 ft from the property's right sideline and 11.5 ft from the from the front boundary line.

1031
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:26,270
Uh, that 11.5 is, uh, what makes the preexisting nonconforming, uh, status where 15 feet is required in this particular zone.

1032
01:18:27,111 --> 01:18:29,952
Uh, the single family residence is somewhat dated.

1033
01:18:30,152 --> 01:18:32,153
This is a post-World War II neighborhood.

1034
01:18:32,173 --> 01:18:36,315
Um, a lot of the residences in it were built, uh, circa 1950s.

1035
01:18:36,975 --> 01:18:40,256
Uh, this property was built in 1956 to be precise.

1036
01:18:40,897 --> 01:18:42,677
And so it, while Ms.

1037
01:18:42,717 --> 01:18:44,078
Morgan has continually

1038
01:18:44,858 --> 01:18:58,345
improved the residence, there are aspects of it that are dated, and now she's at the point where she can no longer make improvements to make a modern home without altering the structure.

1039
01:18:59,045 --> 01:18:59,945
She's somewhat limited.

1040
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:11,831
So the real purpose behind this addition, Mr. McDougall, if you could bring up the document called Morgan Plans Final, which are the architectural plans.

1041
01:19:23,653 --> 01:19:25,254
I could also share on my screen as well.

1042
01:19:25,394 --> 01:19:27,636
Sorry, I just, I renamed them from my files.

1043
01:19:27,656 --> 01:19:31,458
So I was trying to find what you said, and I just was not finding it, but I've got it now.

1044
01:19:31,999 --> 01:19:33,140
Okay, thank you for that.

1045
01:19:39,664 --> 01:19:47,409
And so page A1 of the architectural plans reflect what the property would look like with the addition.

1046
01:19:47,789 --> 01:19:51,912
You'll see that the area closest to, you'll see the,

1047
01:19:53,258 --> 01:20:03,091
stamped concrete proposed parking area, the stairway off that the area with the open porch there is the 10 foot by 20 foot 4 foot addition.

1048
01:20:05,074 --> 01:20:07,197
If you scroll down to page A2,

1049
01:20:08,437 --> 01:20:10,958
it'll provide a floor plan as to really what's being done here.

1050
01:20:12,258 --> 01:20:26,041
The present kitchen and dining room area, it could be best described as a galley kitchen, very utility-based, no modern amenities, old wiring, inefficient appliances.

1051
01:20:26,661 --> 01:20:31,922
The idea is by doing a modest expansion, it opens up for the opportunity for placement of

1052
01:20:33,002 --> 01:20:43,949
some modern appliances, modern amenities and make the house consistent with modern expectations for residential real estate properties instead of this very small cramped space.

1053
01:20:48,232 --> 01:20:55,937
The proposed addition of the 240 square feet

1054
01:20:57,666 --> 01:21:01,613
would increase the footprint of the existing dwelling from 1,189 square feet to 1,429 square feet.

1055
01:21:06,567 --> 01:21:27,600
What's notable is that the majority of oversized lots in the neighborhood, and how I classify that is those 7,500 square feet and larger, have far larger homes, and this modest addition actually puts it right in line with the average of other homes on oversized lots.

1056
01:21:29,101 --> 01:21:31,403
Unlike many of these oversized lots,

1057
01:21:32,443 --> 01:21:42,602
This is one of the narrowest ones there's only two other lots in the entirety of Maurice Street that are of similar size that actually have smaller frontage or smaller width than.

1058
01:21:43,595 --> 01:21:43,795
Ms.

1059
01:21:43,835 --> 01:21:44,675
Morgan's property.

1060
01:21:44,856 --> 01:21:58,321
So what that means is that in order to build off of the existing residence in a way to actually allow for this modest expansion to happen, she would need to encroach into both the front and the side setback.

1061
01:21:59,162 --> 01:22:06,945
Going into the rear is both cost and ecologically inefficient.

1062
01:22:07,205 --> 01:22:10,826
It would require probably doing quite a lot more site development and site impact.

1063
01:22:12,555 --> 01:22:16,458
as opposed to simply building off of the existing structure.

1064
01:22:17,819 --> 01:22:19,920
I will note that four of Ms.

1065
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:23,403
Morgan's neighbors have submitted letters of support for this project.

1066
01:22:24,003 --> 01:22:30,027
I am not aware of any letters of opposition, but I'm sure if I'm incorrect on that, someone will correct me.

1067
01:22:32,640 --> 01:23:01,661
So in terms of applying the variance criteria here, we believe that the unique features of this lot are its size, which is again oversized, but it's very narrow width, which limits the areas of expansion even modestly here and precludes building out to the rear, which would avoid needing a variance, but would again be financially inefficient and be more impactful

1068
01:23:02,742 --> 01:23:06,285
likely requiring some work with shallow bedrock or shallow ledge.

1069
01:23:08,827 --> 01:23:22,677
To move on to the parking, you'll note if you look at the image in the top right corner there, there is one existing off-street parking space and a subsurface garage.

1070
01:23:23,497 --> 01:23:23,658
The

1071
01:23:25,506 --> 01:23:29,427
parking space is approximately between 7 and 8 feet wide.

1072
01:23:29,708 --> 01:23:36,230
It's extremely narrow, but it actually goes down gradient in order to access the garage and quite sharply.

1073
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:42,952
The width of it makes it infeasible for use to store a garage.

1074
01:23:43,933 --> 01:23:47,017
to store a vehicle within the garage except for smaller sedans.

1075
01:23:48,598 --> 01:23:57,728
Because of the nature of the steep grade going into the garage, parking within that driveway is actually physically hazardous.

1076
01:23:58,268 --> 01:23:59,810
It ices up in the wintertime.

1077
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:01,331
It is very narrow.

1078
01:24:02,372 --> 01:24:02,572
Ms.

1079
01:24:02,612 --> 01:24:13,660
Morgan has had double knee surgery, and so she is worried for her physical safety going up that garage and using that primarily as her parking space.

1080
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:16,662
So what she's had to do is utilize off-street parking.

1081
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:21,206
For those that know the neighborhood, Maurice Street is very narrow.

1082
01:24:21,526 --> 01:24:24,948
There's a tremendous amount of use of on-street parking.

1083
01:24:26,249 --> 01:24:29,952
So she has proposed to add this parking space within the front setback.

1084
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:36,897
in order to allow for additional off-street parking, relying less on on-street parking.

1085
01:24:37,438 --> 01:24:52,910
It also improves visibility beyond what's currently there because instead of backing out and going up gradients where there may be a blind spot, she's now going to be at grade like many of the other driveways in the neighborhood, such that she has better lines of sight when entering onto Maurice Street.

1086
01:24:55,232 --> 01:24:59,796
Not a lot of properties on this street have subgrade garages.

1087
01:25:01,592 --> 01:25:03,913
And so we believe that's another unique factor here.

1088
01:25:05,093 --> 01:25:13,797
Given this, we believe that the grants of the variance would not result in any detriment to the public good.

1089
01:25:15,237 --> 01:25:20,960
It's not contrary or will not substantially derogate from the intent of the purpose of the zoning ordinance.

1090
01:25:22,872 --> 01:25:33,928
Again, here, you know, the additional lot coverage from this driveway would only increase the total law coverage to 15%, even if she had a just a bare minimum lot of 5000 square feet.

1091
01:25:35,423 --> 01:25:39,184
she would actually still be under the 40% coverage requirement.

1092
01:25:40,424 --> 01:25:47,706
And so we believe we have ample space for this without adversely impacting the neighborhood, adversely impacting folks' access to air and light.

1093
01:25:48,186 --> 01:25:55,008
It doesn't result in overcrowding, because it's a very, very modest addition on an oversized lot to begin with.

1094
01:25:55,868 --> 01:25:58,469
And we believe that if the

1095
01:25:59,855 --> 01:26:04,799
variance requests were to be denied, there'd be a substantial hardship to Ms.

1096
01:26:04,839 --> 01:26:05,179
Morgan.

1097
01:26:05,219 --> 01:26:10,123
She wouldn't be able to make a reasonable use of her property by bringing it up to modern standards.

1098
01:26:10,604 --> 01:26:19,611
She wouldn't be able to give herself a safe parking space to be able to use her property and allow her to really age in the home more effectively and more safely.

1099
01:26:21,813 --> 01:26:27,998
As she gets older, going up that driveway, and I've gone up it several times, would be hazardous.

1100
01:26:28,923 --> 01:26:32,484
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Ms.

1101
01:26:32,504 --> 01:26:38,307
Morgan to add anything that she might wish to add to this discussion and happy to answer any questions the board has.

1102
01:26:39,787 --> 01:26:40,008
Thank you.

1103
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:40,688
Hi, everybody.

1104
01:26:40,708 --> 01:26:41,688
Hello.

1105
01:26:42,188 --> 01:26:51,032
I just wanted to say, as Eric said, I have lived at 54 for the last 20 years and have wanted to redo this kitchen.

1106
01:26:51,052 --> 01:26:53,053
It is very dated.

1107
01:26:53,273 --> 01:26:57,555
I think it's the original appliances that the house has in it.

1108
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:02,624
And it would be great to be able to modernize and improve the house.

1109
01:27:02,904 --> 01:27:06,909
Um, as far as the outside, um, everything he said is true.

1110
01:27:06,969 --> 01:27:13,636
I have not been able to use that driveway for its purpose of a driveway for the last 20 years.

1111
01:27:14,377 --> 01:27:18,201
Other than on occasion when we have street cleaning and I have no choice, but to use it.

1112
01:27:18,381 --> 01:27:19,723
And it is so steep.

1113
01:27:20,946 --> 01:27:24,328
It's almost scary to back out of that driveway.

1114
01:27:24,348 --> 01:27:26,970
It is very, very narrow.

1115
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:30,711
You can't open the door the whole way once you're in it.

1116
01:27:30,892 --> 01:27:36,334
So you have to kind of squeeze out of the car and try to get out of it.

1117
01:27:36,615 --> 01:27:41,617
And as he said, it is true, I have had double knee replacements in the last few months.

1118
01:27:41,897 --> 01:27:43,678
So it is getting harder.

1119
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:48,322
And as I get older, it's not going to get any easier.

1120
01:27:48,382 --> 01:27:58,972
So a nice flat off the road spot would be really nice and safe for me to use.

1121
01:27:59,013 --> 01:28:01,875
So that's really all I have to add to him.

1122
01:28:01,915 --> 01:28:03,136
It's basically what he said.

1123
01:28:03,157 --> 01:28:07,301
Thank you.

1124
01:28:08,001 --> 01:28:08,782
Questions from the board?

1125
01:28:18,952 --> 01:28:21,754
I just want to double check my understanding.

1126
01:28:22,014 --> 01:28:35,203
I believe one of the letters of support is the neighbor immediately abutting in the direction you're proposing to build, so 56 Maurice Street says they're in support.

1127
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:35,683
Is that right?

1128
01:28:36,484 --> 01:28:38,185
Yes, James Driscoll.

1129
01:28:38,765 --> 01:28:43,188
I got letters from either side of my house and two across the street.

1130
01:28:45,149 --> 01:28:46,210
Alright, thank you.

1131
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:49,437
other questions from the board?

1132
01:28:54,339 --> 01:28:57,501
Seeing none, I'll open it up to members of the public.

1133
01:28:57,541 --> 01:29:01,262
If you're a member of the public who would like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

1134
01:29:01,282 --> 01:29:06,685
You can raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera and raise your hand, type in the chat, or you can email Dennis.

1135
01:29:18,778 --> 01:29:22,180
Not seeing any members of the public who would like to speak on this matter.

1136
01:29:23,401 --> 01:29:28,244
Chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

1137
01:29:32,167 --> 01:29:32,547
Motion.

1138
01:29:33,487 --> 01:29:34,108
Do I have a second?

1139
01:29:36,069 --> 01:29:36,249
Second.

1140
01:29:36,269 --> 01:29:36,649
I'll second.

1141
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:37,970
All right.

1142
01:29:38,090 --> 01:29:39,691
We're going to take a roll call.

1143
01:29:39,711 --> 01:29:40,152
Yvette?

1144
01:29:44,054 --> 01:29:44,214
Aye.

1145
01:29:45,075 --> 01:29:45,515
Mary?

1146
01:29:46,696 --> 01:29:46,836
Aye.

1147
01:29:47,597 --> 01:29:47,897
Chris?

1148
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:49,680
Aye.

1149
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:50,600
Jim.

1150
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:51,440
Aye.

1151
01:29:52,201 --> 01:29:52,461
Andre.

1152
01:29:52,481 --> 01:29:52,561
Aye.

1153
01:29:53,261 --> 01:29:55,261
All right.

1154
01:29:55,301 --> 01:29:56,081
We're now deliberating.

1155
01:29:56,121 --> 01:29:56,862
What do you think, folks?

1156
01:30:00,202 --> 01:30:01,062
Jim, go ahead.

1157
01:30:01,422 --> 01:30:02,823
I think the plan looks great.

1158
01:30:04,123 --> 01:30:11,464
And I know what it's like to have a driveway that goes down into the garage.

1159
01:30:12,445 --> 01:30:14,585
So I like it.

1160
01:30:14,785 --> 01:30:17,146
It conforms with the neighborhood.

1161
01:30:17,206 --> 01:30:18,526
It makes it look

1162
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,281
Very nice.

1163
01:30:20,301 --> 01:30:24,745
So I just want to let you know, I'm all in favor of that.

1164
01:30:24,765 --> 01:30:27,948
Right.

1165
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:28,668
Thank you, Jim.

1166
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:33,593
Other thoughts from the board.

1167
01:30:35,575 --> 01:30:36,356
Can you hear me okay?

1168
01:30:36,636 --> 01:30:36,856
Yes.

1169
01:30:37,256 --> 01:30:37,817
A little bit.

1170
01:30:37,857 --> 01:30:39,138
Can you speak up just a little bit?

1171
01:30:39,158 --> 01:30:40,780
I'm having a real hard time for some reason.

1172
01:30:41,530 --> 01:30:44,792
Yeah, I'm having, I've been having audio issues, so I apologize.

1173
01:30:46,292 --> 01:30:51,314
My, I just want to say thank you for the thorough presentation.

1174
01:30:52,235 --> 01:30:53,996
And I appreciate that.

1175
01:30:54,076 --> 01:30:57,337
I think you answered all the questions that I had.

1176
01:30:57,777 --> 01:31:03,600
I really appreciate you getting the letters of support from all your abutters.

1177
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,321
And, and thank you.

1178
01:31:06,341 --> 01:31:09,623
I think I, you know, have to support this.

1179
01:31:11,412 --> 01:31:13,193
All right, other thoughts from the board?

1180
01:31:20,635 --> 01:31:32,019
I will add, if I could, Mr. Chair, that I think this is a very reasonable addition and extension, and it makes a lot of sense.

1181
01:31:32,659 --> 01:31:38,921
And it's actually an improvement on the design and the look of the house.

1182
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:41,967
Thank you, Chris.

1183
01:31:42,787 --> 01:31:43,968
Other thoughts from the board?

1184
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:54,791
I can go next.

1185
01:31:54,871 --> 01:31:57,171
I'm not voting, but I'll just share.

1186
01:31:57,872 --> 01:32:02,513
So I do agree that the lot is unusual.

1187
01:32:02,533 --> 01:32:08,394
It's unusual in its very long, relatively narrow shape.

1188
01:32:08,955 --> 01:32:10,535
It's unusual topography.

1189
01:32:11,608 --> 01:32:17,310
Sounds like even the soil conditions are a bit unusual in terms of the construction implications.

1190
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:31,934
So yeah, I think given the position of the existing structure and its style, there are very limited options to add space to modernize it.

1191
01:32:32,234 --> 01:32:39,376
And with the neighbor, the most impacted neighbor in support, that seems like a,

1192
01:32:40,342 --> 01:32:45,744
relatively harmless relief to grant in this case.

1193
01:32:45,764 --> 01:32:54,346
All right, there's nothing else.

1194
01:32:55,907 --> 01:33:06,530
Chair awaits a motion on the requested variances for the side yard setback and the parking in the front yard setback.

1195
01:33:14,232 --> 01:33:19,553
motion to approve the variances for side yard and front yard setback.

1196
01:33:19,893 --> 01:33:22,653
And then actually, Chris, I apologize.

1197
01:33:22,693 --> 01:33:29,035
I think that we also need a special permit for extending an existing nonconformity.

1198
01:33:30,195 --> 01:33:33,195
So if you want to amend the motion, you can include that, too.

1199
01:33:33,935 --> 01:33:34,695
OK.

1200
01:33:35,176 --> 01:33:40,997
To add to the motion, a special permit to extend an existing nonconformity.

1201
01:33:42,277 --> 01:33:42,457
Great.

1202
01:33:44,481 --> 01:33:44,901
I'll second.

1203
01:33:44,941 --> 01:33:48,182
All right, we're going to take a roll call vote.

1204
01:33:48,602 --> 01:33:48,942
Andre?

1205
01:33:48,962 --> 01:33:52,904
Aye.

1206
01:33:53,724 --> 01:33:54,024
Jim?

1207
01:33:54,744 --> 01:33:54,884
Aye.

1208
01:33:55,965 --> 01:33:56,305
Chris?

1209
01:33:57,345 --> 01:33:57,485
Aye.

1210
01:33:58,105 --> 01:33:58,465
Mary?

1211
01:33:59,226 --> 01:33:59,346
Aye.

1212
01:34:00,286 --> 01:34:00,486
Beth?

1213
01:34:01,486 --> 01:34:01,606
Aye.

1214
01:34:02,247 --> 01:34:06,688
All right, the variances and special permit are approved.

1215
01:34:07,508 --> 01:34:08,569
Thank you very much, folks.

1216
01:34:09,349 --> 01:34:10,429
Thank you so much.

1217
01:34:10,649 --> 01:34:11,850
I appreciate your time.

1218
01:34:15,576 --> 01:34:19,220
Just to reiterate what I've said a few times before.

1219
01:34:19,921 --> 01:34:26,390
Actually, I think I think I know it's turning bar you've already kind of seem like just working on a draft decision.

1220
01:34:28,032 --> 01:34:34,357
Yes, Miss Morgan had told me that it would help you if I put together a draft for you to be able to ship up to legal.

1221
01:34:36,778 --> 01:34:41,101
No pride of authorship, of course, but if you need anything else from me, I'm happy to give it to you.

1222
01:34:41,141 --> 01:34:42,042
No, I appreciate that.

1223
01:34:42,082 --> 01:34:47,585
So then I'll review that and then I'll expedite matters very quickly.

1224
01:34:47,626 --> 01:34:48,966
But then again, the methodology is the same.

1225
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:56,477
Once it's in and filed in the clerk's office, that'll start the 20 days.

1226
01:34:56,537 --> 01:35:00,820
And then once those 20 days are over, you get a letter of no appeal from the city clerk.

1227
01:35:01,141 --> 01:35:08,527
And then once you file it in the Milosec South Courthouse in Cambridge, then you can get your building permit and get started.

1228
01:35:08,987 --> 01:35:09,608
Fantastic.

1229
01:35:10,449 --> 01:35:11,049
Thank you.

1230
01:35:11,129 --> 01:35:13,932
Dennis, thank you so much for your help through this process.

1231
01:35:13,992 --> 01:35:14,712
I appreciate it.

1232
01:35:14,732 --> 01:35:15,893
You're very welcome.

1233
01:35:15,953 --> 01:35:16,674
I'm glad to do it.

1234
01:35:17,415 --> 01:35:17,995
Thank you, folks.

1235
01:35:18,415 --> 01:35:18,976
Have a great one.

1236
01:35:19,476 --> 01:35:19,717
Thank you.

1237
01:35:23,143 --> 01:35:26,707
All right, I think that brings us to administrative updates.

1238
01:35:26,747 --> 01:35:27,388
Is that right, Dennis?

1239
01:35:28,315 --> 01:35:30,717
Um, we have a couple 1 is that.

1240
01:35:31,297 --> 01:35:35,981
I know I said, hopefully it was going to be this meeting, but we will have the new member appointed by next meeting that it just.

1241
01:35:36,962 --> 01:35:44,408
The mayor wanted me to kind of review more candidates because I had someone and she was like, just kind of spread it out a little bit more, which I appreciate, you know, just to try to make sure we can.

1242
01:35:45,088 --> 01:35:48,471
I'm good solidly, so I, I put some forward to Alicia and.

1243
01:35:49,171 --> 01:35:52,474
And once Alicia gets the okay, then we're going to put it.

1244
01:35:52,894 --> 01:35:57,278
Back to the mayor's office, so by the time of the next meeting, we will be in full couple in the 7.

1245
01:35:58,608 --> 01:35:58,988
Wonderful.

1246
01:35:59,268 --> 01:35:59,629
Great news.

1247
01:36:00,829 --> 01:36:17,060
And just one other thing, which it's, I will say this, I forgot to let you know, and we do have time to do this, but in, actually, this is more just a little bit inside stuff, but I've received a phone call from another, it was actually a

1248
01:36:18,395 --> 01:36:25,139
Town manager out in Western Mass who they apparently have the same marijuana ordinance that Medford does.

1249
01:36:25,859 --> 01:36:34,344
And within that ordinance, there's a, the special permits are only good for five years and they have to get renewed every five years.

1250
01:36:35,404 --> 01:36:44,890
The ordinance doesn't actually, all it says is that it'll be renewed by a methodology basically from the special permit granting authority, which is us.

1251
01:36:45,978 --> 01:37:01,459
So we only did ours, a couple years ago so we have time, some, I'm in speaking with, we have a new city solicitor so I've kind of just broached it with him and we'll come up with some sort of, we're going to find out because I mean, a lot of other towns have that same.

1252
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:07,715
It was sort of a boilerplate marijuana ordinance that was created, you know, with help from the marijuana commission.

1253
01:37:07,875 --> 01:37:12,760
So we're not alone in this because when I was talking to that administrator, he's talked to 4 or 5 other towns.

1254
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:13,881
We're all kind of in the same boat.

1255
01:37:14,562 --> 01:37:19,767
So, you know, we'll try to figure out what we're sort of not sure if it's going to be done administratively.

1256
01:37:19,787 --> 01:37:21,248
It might just have to be, you know.

1257
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:28,443
have it at a hearing just to renew and figure out some sort of methodology to do so.

1258
01:37:28,483 --> 01:37:30,244
It can be something that's done by the building commissioner.

1259
01:37:30,264 --> 01:37:35,687
It can be something that can be done by some of the other city people, like maybe get the chief police involved.

1260
01:37:35,707 --> 01:37:36,427
We're not really sure.

1261
01:37:36,507 --> 01:37:38,448
But I just wanted to kind of give you a heads up that it's coming.

1262
01:37:38,468 --> 01:37:39,669
We're going to figure this out.

1263
01:37:39,829 --> 01:37:47,833
And the actual methodology, we'll have to sort of, I was talking to Scott, the building commissioner,

1264
01:37:49,601 --> 01:37:57,577
He figures since we're redoing our rules and regs, we can add that to it as part of that and just have it in there.

1265
01:37:59,642 --> 01:38:19,614
But I was very grateful for the gentleman who told me about this because, I mean, without that, I'm not sure we would have known about it because it's very, it's like, you know, very minuscule language somehow in there that just basically says the permit's good for five years and we're responsible for it, so.

1266
01:38:20,154 --> 01:38:21,675
Okay, all right, thanks for the update.

1267
01:38:22,540 --> 01:38:28,004
Um, so the, I guess we'll hear next, you'll either just bring it up in a future meeting.

1268
01:38:28,064 --> 01:38:35,950
And I'll probably put it on the agenda once we actually have some sort of more information, but this was more just to let you know, literally I just found out, I think it was yesterday or the day before.

1269
01:38:36,350 --> 01:38:36,770
Okay.

1270
01:38:37,170 --> 01:38:37,311
Great.

1271
01:38:41,917 --> 01:38:47,739
And the software that I was using to do the meeting minutes, that was, I just didn't realize it was Tracy DuPont's own personal one.

1272
01:38:47,759 --> 01:38:49,400
So I needed to get my own.

1273
01:38:49,420 --> 01:38:50,540
So I'm sort of working on that.

1274
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:53,301
So that's why I fell a little behind on working on it.

1275
01:38:53,741 --> 01:38:59,323
So, but, uh, apparently there's a tab in zoom now that can create it.

1276
01:38:59,343 --> 01:39:06,905
So I'm going to look at that as well for tonight's meeting and sort of see if I can generate them because somebody else in the office has used it and they said they work pretty well.

1277
01:39:06,945 --> 01:39:08,186
So, okay.

1278
01:39:08,826 --> 01:39:09,206
Excuse me.

1279
01:39:09,226 --> 01:39:11,487
Thanks for the update, Dennis.

1280
01:39:12,961 --> 01:39:18,765
All right, well, since we don't have meeting minutes to approve, I think that brings us to the end of our agenda, is that right?

1281
01:39:19,565 --> 01:39:20,085
That is correct.

1282
01:39:20,486 --> 01:39:21,326
Okay.

1283
01:39:21,426 --> 01:39:24,028
Chair awaits a motion to adjourn.

1284
01:39:24,048 --> 01:39:27,150
I make a motion to adjourn.

1285
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:28,811
Do we have a second?

1286
01:39:32,353 --> 01:39:32,693
Second.

1287
01:39:33,854 --> 01:39:35,115
Have a great fourth, everyone.

1288
01:39:35,815 --> 01:39:36,315
Thanks, you too.

1289
01:39:36,715 --> 01:39:40,458
We still need to do a roll call, I think, Jim, but Andre?

1290
01:39:41,278 --> 01:39:41,398
Aye.

1291
01:39:42,279 --> 01:39:42,459
Jim?

1292
01:39:43,566 --> 01:39:43,707
Aye.

1293
01:39:44,629 --> 01:39:44,969
Chris.

1294
01:39:46,432 --> 01:39:46,573
Aye.

1295
01:39:47,214 --> 01:39:47,555
Mary.

1296
01:39:47,575 --> 01:39:48,497
Aye.

1297
01:39:49,158 --> 01:39:49,378
Beth.

1298
01:39:50,421 --> 01:39:50,541
Aye.

1299
01:39:51,222 --> 01:39:51,483
Mike.

1300
01:39:51,803 --> 01:39:51,904
Aye.

1301
01:39:52,304 --> 01:39:52,805
Yeah.

1302
01:39:52,825 --> 01:39:53,808
Have a great fourth indeed.

1303
01:39:53,828 --> 01:39:54,810
Stay safe everyone.
