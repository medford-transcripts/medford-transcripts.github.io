[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all very much for being here tonight.

25
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:41,130
[SPEAKER_10]: The action and discussion item for tonight is 24-033, zoning ordinance updates with the NS Associates team.

26
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:51,434
[SPEAKER_10]: So tonight what's on our agenda is to follow up on two topics that we have discussed once before at our committee meeting two weeks ago.

27
00:16:52,856 --> 00:17:02,385
[SPEAKER_10]: On March 12th, we reviewed a early framework for updates to Medford's accessory dwelling units or ADUs ordinance.

28
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:08,421
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a long discussion to get this update project started off.

29
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:27,459
[SPEAKER_10]: The update from Innes Associates flagged updates that the City of Medford must make to our ADUs ordinance to become in compliance with the new state law that requires that ADUs be by right in any residential district that allows single family homes by right.

30
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,861
[SPEAKER_10]: So we talked about that and what that means for our zoning ordinance.

31
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:49,611
[SPEAKER_10]: And the zoning consultant and associates also flagged areas where there are more decisions left up to the city when it comes to local ADUs and options that we have for further updates we can make to further regulate or encourage ADUs beyond just the new regulations that are required by state law.

32
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:51,732
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we'll be looking at an updated draft

33
00:17:52,432 --> 00:18:00,123
[SPEAKER_10]: of the ADU's ordinance tonight in response to the questions and feedback that councillors and committee community members had two weeks ago.

34
00:18:01,885 --> 00:18:05,891
[SPEAKER_10]: We will also tonight be visiting the topic of

35
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:09,715
[SPEAKER_10]: updated zoning for Medford Square.

36
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:16,861
[SPEAKER_10]: This will be our very first time looking at a proposal of an updated zoning map for Medford Square and it will not be the last time we talk about it either.

37
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:33,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Two weeks ago, we looked at a really preliminary introductory, a 30,000 foot view of a zoning map that encapsulates a commercial framework or a zoning map encapsulating a commercial framework for the city touching on all major squares.

38
00:18:34,376 --> 00:18:41,342
[SPEAKER_10]: corridors, mixed-use, and commercial districts, and we decided that from there we're kind of going to draw the telescope in.

39
00:18:41,382 --> 00:18:53,714
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go from that bird's-eye view commercial framework and focus the dial on Medford Square, and then West Medford Square, and then other major corridors and mixed-use and commercial districts.

40
00:18:53,754 --> 00:18:55,236
[SPEAKER_10]: So the first one up is Medford Square.

41
00:18:55,256 --> 00:18:58,419
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that the Innes Associates has presented, has prepared

42
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, some maps and some diagrams for us to look at and respond to tonight.

43
00:19:04,401 --> 00:19:07,743
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll be able to get a lot of questions and ideas and concerns on the record.

44
00:19:08,383 --> 00:19:15,666
[SPEAKER_10]: And that will be followed up by, um, further conversations on this topic in this committee, um, over the next several weeks.

45
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:21,948
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know that Paola has a presentation, um, on all of this before I throw it over to Paola.

46
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:26,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I want to ask if any of my fellow counselors have any questions or comments to start off the evening.

47
00:19:29,762 --> 00:19:29,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

48
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing none, plenty of time for that later on.

49
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:34,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Paola, please go ahead with your presentation.

50
00:19:34,044 --> 00:19:38,166
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

51
00:19:38,206 --> 00:19:38,766
[SPEAKER_18]: Good afternoon.

52
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:40,807
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much, Vice President Collins.

53
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:44,089
[SPEAKER_18]: If I may, I'm going to start sharing the presentation.

54
00:20:00,778 --> 00:20:01,338
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

55
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,901
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um, I'm Paula Ramos Martinez for anyone who's new in this.

56
00:20:09,761 --> 00:20:22,545
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been working with the city of Medford for the rezoning, um, from what taken the principles that were identified in the comprehensive, um.

57
00:20:23,606 --> 00:20:25,606
[SPEAKER_18]: Plan that was done two years ago.

58
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:29,668
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, um, the senior, um.

59
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,462
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, I'm the senior urban planner and designer.

60
00:20:34,742 --> 00:20:36,703
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm here with Jimmy Rocha.

61
00:20:36,783 --> 00:20:39,105
[SPEAKER_18]: He's the data scientist in the team.

62
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:44,488
[SPEAKER_18]: So he will also be on the team here today.

63
00:20:44,848 --> 00:21:00,297
[SPEAKER_18]: So today what we're going to look is at the process timeline, what we have been doing, and what are we going to do for the next months, the opportunities for when public comments can be given, and when those are going to be in the near future.

64
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,809
[SPEAKER_18]: we will do a small introduction.

65
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:12,032
[SPEAKER_18]: We will talk about the mixed use districts, especially focused on Medford Square and then to the AGU draft.

66
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:24,976
[SPEAKER_18]: So we've started last planning and permitting committee meeting in March 12th with all the commercial block.

67
00:21:26,096 --> 00:21:27,317
[SPEAKER_18]: We will be looking at

68
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,123
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so we will be looking more into the squares met for square was met for and then other quarters.

69
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,145
[SPEAKER_18]: We have worked and passed over.

70
00:21:35,165 --> 00:21:36,606
[SPEAKER_18]: The City Council has passed already.

71
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,928
[SPEAKER_18]: Mystic Avenue quarter and Salem Street quarter.

72
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:43,391
[SPEAKER_18]: Um so we will be looking more now on to the

73
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:49,070
[SPEAKER_18]: that.

74
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:57,295
[SPEAKER_18]: Later on in May, we will be looking at Wellington and Glenwood, but that was that will be really the last piece of all the big puzzle.

75
00:21:58,015 --> 00:22:02,478
[SPEAKER_18]: We have been working since January in the residential districts.

76
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:05,440
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, that is important because.

77
00:22:06,921 --> 00:22:13,244
[SPEAKER_18]: In the very near future, the CDB the Community Development Board in April 2nd.

78
00:22:13,424 --> 00:22:14,665
[SPEAKER_18]: We will be talking about the

79
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:20,072
[SPEAKER_18]: that will be an opportunity.

80
00:22:20,112 --> 00:22:25,416
[SPEAKER_18]: And then in May, we will be talking about the commercial and mixed districts.

81
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,062
[SPEAKER_18]: Tomorrow, we will be having a residential public Q&A.

82
00:22:34,782 --> 00:22:41,627
[SPEAKER_18]: That's something that we also add into this layer of public engagement.

83
00:22:42,325 --> 00:22:51,827
[SPEAKER_18]: And so tomorrow, Thursday 27th, we will be at the city hall to answer any questions.

84
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:54,788
[SPEAKER_18]: There will be a presentation of what are we doing.

85
00:22:55,188 --> 00:23:04,470
[SPEAKER_18]: We will present some maps and help anyone to understand what are we doing and hear from you all the feedback that we can.

86
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:08,731
[SPEAKER_18]: So once we go to the city board, we have already the public feedback.

87
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:15,914
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, we will do also as well one for the squares and other for the corridors and then for the Wellington area.

88
00:23:16,454 --> 00:23:19,476
[SPEAKER_18]: And those will be, um, as well published.

89
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:21,557
[SPEAKER_18]: As we go alone.

90
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:22,878
[SPEAKER_18]: Um.

91
00:23:24,088 --> 00:23:30,231
[SPEAKER_18]: So in March this month, we will be looking at the commercial framework, Medford Square.

92
00:23:30,251 --> 00:23:32,612
[SPEAKER_18]: We will be looking at the ADU.

93
00:23:33,172 --> 00:23:48,440
[SPEAKER_18]: Next month, we will be looking at West Medford and other corridors, and then different administrative citywide topics, a site plan review, community solar, non-conforming, et cetera.

94
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,422
[SPEAKER_18]: And then parking and transport demand management will come in May with the Wellington area.

95
00:23:55,944 --> 00:24:00,048
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, here's the same thing just to... Sorry.

96
00:24:05,552 --> 00:24:10,736
[SPEAKER_18]: Same structure as before, but by... Sorry.

97
00:24:11,857 --> 00:24:12,197
[SPEAKER_18]: By the...

98
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,431
[SPEAKER_18]: at what time of the process we are.

99
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:26,596
[SPEAKER_18]: So we presented first the topic, then the city council will refer the topic to the city board, then the city board would vote the topic and refer it back to city council.

100
00:24:26,636 --> 00:24:27,677
[SPEAKER_18]: So all these times.

101
00:24:28,257 --> 00:24:37,502
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we will publish here all the time, updating all the new public meetings that we have, or the new already scheduled city boards meetings.

102
00:24:39,943 --> 00:24:42,585
[SPEAKER_18]: So as we said for many times,

103
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:53,827
[SPEAKER_18]: We have been doing the rezoning of what came from the METFOR Comprehensive Plan and the METFOR Climate Action and Adaptation Plan.

104
00:24:54,348 --> 00:25:04,615
[SPEAKER_18]: So all the principles that were identified in this plan, we are taking all the ones that have something to do with zoning and we are implementing them now.

105
00:25:06,322 --> 00:25:24,229
[SPEAKER_18]: This was the vision where we can see the corridors, the squares, every different district or node that was identified as something characteristic that needed to, that needed to, that had some goals and objectives with them.

106
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:33,273
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have the, these are now the mixed use districts or areas where we are going to work.

107
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:36,316
[SPEAKER_18]: Um different quarters squares.

108
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:40,240
[SPEAKER_18]: We also are going to work with the institutional that is met for tops area.

109
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:42,723
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the Wellington that will come later on.

110
00:25:44,765 --> 00:25:51,611
[SPEAKER_18]: This was the commercial framework that was presented last in the last planning and permitting committee meeting.

111
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:55,454
[SPEAKER_18]: We have Salem and Mystic that you see with a black outline.

112
00:25:55,874 --> 00:25:59,338
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are already done and were already approved by the City Council.

113
00:25:59,698 --> 00:26:02,060
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are working on the others that you see here.

114
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,203
[SPEAKER_18]: Today we're going to focus on Medford Square.

115
00:26:06,948 --> 00:26:11,570
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are presenting here what you're seeing here in this map is your current zoning.

116
00:26:12,191 --> 00:26:17,713
[SPEAKER_18]: If we do a little bit of zoom to that, we have City Hall in this area.

117
00:26:18,634 --> 00:26:20,155
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope you see the cursor.

118
00:26:21,515 --> 00:26:27,498
[SPEAKER_18]: Then we have the Chevalier Theater is in this area, Forest Street.

119
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:36,183
[SPEAKER_18]: Then we have CVS and Joseph School in here in High Street, more to the west.

120
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:40,391
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we have here are four different districts that we see.

121
00:26:40,471 --> 00:26:42,974
[SPEAKER_18]: The commercial one is the pinkish area.

122
00:26:44,795 --> 00:26:48,779
[SPEAKER_18]: Then we have apartment two, that's the orange general residential.

123
00:26:49,219 --> 00:26:53,904
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really in the back of Salem Street towards Ashland Street.

124
00:26:54,444 --> 00:26:56,826
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the area for general residential.

125
00:26:57,307 --> 00:27:02,852
[SPEAKER_18]: And then single family that we have, internal and governors block.

126
00:27:04,175 --> 00:27:08,058
[SPEAKER_18]: So in commercial one, what is already permitted in this area?

127
00:27:08,198 --> 00:27:13,643
[SPEAKER_18]: So for residential buildings in all the pink area is six stories by right.

128
00:27:14,163 --> 00:27:15,784
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the height that is permitted.

129
00:27:15,804 --> 00:27:20,848
[SPEAKER_18]: The maximum height for residential buildings, multifamily is six stories by right.

130
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:24,351
[SPEAKER_18]: For commercial buildings is four stories by right.

131
00:27:24,732 --> 00:27:29,275
[SPEAKER_18]: And then other permitted structures is 15 stories by right.

132
00:27:30,276 --> 00:27:31,257
[SPEAKER_18]: So from four to

133
00:27:33,014 --> 00:27:38,479
[SPEAKER_18]: 15, depending on the use, that's what is permitted in the pink area.

134
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:44,483
[SPEAKER_18]: In apartment 2, we have residential building that's 60 stories by right.

135
00:27:45,023 --> 00:27:49,507
[SPEAKER_18]: Commercial use is not allowed in the orange area.

136
00:27:49,987 --> 00:27:53,830
[SPEAKER_18]: And then very specific hotel is 15 stories by right.

137
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:57,576
[SPEAKER_18]: Then we have general residential.

138
00:27:57,616 --> 00:28:01,618
[SPEAKER_18]: This is single unit dwelling and two unit dwellings that are permitted.

139
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:07,242
[SPEAKER_18]: And then single family, it's only one single unit dwelling permitted.

140
00:28:08,782 --> 00:28:11,324
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is the current zoning.

141
00:28:11,464 --> 00:28:13,445
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not what is existing there.

142
00:28:13,465 --> 00:28:15,526
[SPEAKER_18]: What is existing there is usually very low.

143
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:16,947
[SPEAKER_18]: We will see it later.

144
00:28:18,228 --> 00:28:21,790
[SPEAKER_18]: But we have some sections prepared, so we will see that.

145
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:25,332
[SPEAKER_18]: But this is what is the current zoning

146
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:26,919
[SPEAKER_18]: at this point.

147
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,502
[SPEAKER_18]: There are some dimension and standards.

148
00:28:31,562 --> 00:28:34,644
[SPEAKER_18]: We are not going to mention really the dimensions today.

149
00:28:35,024 --> 00:28:47,193
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to look more into the heights and the profiles of the streets and how that fits and what is the most interesting or the best fit in the area.

150
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:48,674
[SPEAKER_18]: What is the most feasible?

151
00:28:49,915 --> 00:28:55,299
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to look more at heights and uses than the dimension standards.

152
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:57,150
[SPEAKER_18]: But this is in your current zoning.

153
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,591
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to show it.

154
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,053
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is what we are proposing.

155
00:29:02,153 --> 00:29:05,655
[SPEAKER_18]: So in the previous districts, we had mixed use.

156
00:29:06,555 --> 00:29:10,658
[SPEAKER_18]: In the previous quarters, we had mixed use one, two, and three in Mystic.

157
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:23,445
[SPEAKER_18]: And that is from the lowest scale to the highest scale, being mixed use one, three stories by right, and then one plus one up to four within incentive zoning.

158
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,022
[SPEAKER_18]: we wanted to have an in between.

159
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:31,265
[SPEAKER_18]: Um makes use two is four stories by right plus two with incentive zoning and then makes use three.

160
00:29:31,485 --> 00:29:37,127
[SPEAKER_18]: It used to be quite high up to, uh, 12 stories in this case.

161
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:40,669
[SPEAKER_18]: Um so in this area was something missing.

162
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:45,731
[SPEAKER_18]: We wanted to have an in between, um, makes use two and makes use

163
00:29:51,288 --> 00:30:02,234
[SPEAKER_18]: So right now, mix used to A, which is the blue, the darker blue, is four stories by right plus two within Sentient Zoning.

164
00:30:02,254 --> 00:30:05,976
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what we see, for example, in Salem or in Mystic.

165
00:30:06,497 --> 00:30:12,740
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we have created mix used to B, which is the more purple, bluish purple violet.

166
00:30:14,361 --> 00:30:15,902
[SPEAKER_18]: And that is six stories by right

167
00:30:16,395 --> 00:30:18,136
[SPEAKER_18]: plus two incentives earning.

168
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,217
[SPEAKER_18]: That means up to eight with incentives earning.

169
00:30:21,777 --> 00:30:26,559
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the mixed use three is six stories by right, six with incentives earning.

170
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:34,362
[SPEAKER_18]: So we kept a small portion of the mixed use one.

171
00:30:35,163 --> 00:30:39,324
[SPEAKER_18]: It's south to High Street, north of the Mystic River.

172
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:45,927
[SPEAKER_18]: That area has quite a few of historic buildings that goes from one to three stories.

173
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:49,866
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, there is one that goes up to four.

174
00:30:50,487 --> 00:30:52,668
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to keep those historic buildings.

175
00:30:53,648 --> 00:30:55,889
[SPEAKER_18]: And there is not a lot of land to grow.

176
00:30:55,909 --> 00:31:01,091
[SPEAKER_18]: We will see it in in one of the sections that we have done is cutting that area.

177
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:06,796
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are also looking at north.

178
00:31:06,956 --> 00:31:12,718
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are going to a lot of these buildings are going to cast shadows on the streets and on the other side.

179
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:16,620
[SPEAKER_18]: So on the other buildings that are in front.

180
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,061
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are need to be very careful with that.

181
00:31:21,741 --> 00:31:26,783
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's why we kept a small portion of it as it still makes use one.

182
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:33,831
[SPEAKER_18]: Then the general, yes, Matthew, if you want to, Matt, if you want to say something.

183
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:37,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Feel free to finish, but once you're done with the slide, I just had something I wanted to say.

184
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,893
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

185
00:31:40,713 --> 00:31:41,173
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.

186
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,134
[SPEAKER_18]: Then we have the mixes too.

187
00:31:44,274 --> 00:31:50,075
[SPEAKER_18]: So mainly all the northern areas or some in between are going to be that mixes too.

188
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:56,297
[SPEAKER_18]: That is four stories and maximum that six stories up to two.

189
00:31:57,192 --> 00:32:00,117
[SPEAKER_18]: more with incentive zoning than six stories maximum.

190
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:09,893
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we have in these corners and also near the city hall and in front of the on Clipper ship Dr.

191
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:20,492
[SPEAKER_18]: those are going to be that mixes to be and then we have a smaller area for that mixes three that is connecting with a mystic river.

192
00:32:21,712 --> 00:32:22,773
[SPEAKER_18]: With the mystic quarter.

193
00:32:24,213 --> 00:32:27,395
[SPEAKER_18]: And the already existing, which is quite high at this point.

194
00:32:28,275 --> 00:32:31,316
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's where it fits to make it conforming what is already there.

195
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,521
[SPEAKER_18]: We can comment on this.

196
00:32:35,701 --> 00:32:41,382
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to show Matt that we have some sections that I would like to go through them.

197
00:32:41,722 --> 00:32:47,603
[SPEAKER_18]: But if you want to already talk about that, the map, feel free to question.

198
00:32:48,723 --> 00:32:49,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Paola.

199
00:32:49,523 --> 00:32:58,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think that I've previewed the section studies that you're going to present next, and I think folks will find them very interesting context.

200
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,766
[SPEAKER_10]: But let's take a pause here in case there are any preliminary

201
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,681
[SPEAKER_10]: questions or comments on this aerial view.

202
00:33:05,081 --> 00:33:08,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Lemmon will go to you first, unless you wanna hold your question for later.

203
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:24,549
[SPEAKER_09]: No, so the first one was, I was just, was looking at the plot, the mixed use to be directly to the right of city hall.

204
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:29,171
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just wondering if that could, if there would be any logic

205
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:45,071
[SPEAKER_09]: And updating that to mixed use three, because kind of thinking that, like, higher buildings there could act as a sound barrier to some of the traffic on on ninety three.

206
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:56,680
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, I was just I was just like, what I was just wondering, first off, if you think that that could possibly be an idea that would work or what you're.

207
00:33:57,673 --> 00:34:04,597
[SPEAKER_09]: what your thoughts would be on this.

208
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:24,110
[SPEAKER_09]: I also had questions relating to whether or not there could, this could just be a discussion point for later, but whether it would be possible to change the traffic patterns in

209
00:34:25,617 --> 00:34:36,327
[SPEAKER_09]: or if the traffic patterns in Medford Square ever were changed, which I think could be something that, you know, we might see like 30 years in the future or something like that.

210
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:41,312
[SPEAKER_09]: But basically, I just don't like the traffic patterns that we see in Medford Square at the moment.

211
00:34:41,332 --> 00:34:49,680
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm wondering if the zoning changes could affect that, could affect that at all.

212
00:34:54,481 --> 00:34:59,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thank you for putting that suggestion in that question on the record, Councillor Lemming.

213
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:02,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if Paula has a response to this.

214
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:05,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm certainly always helpful.

215
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:13,939
[SPEAKER_10]: I think these are exactly the areas where we should be evaluating for where our subdistricts of greatest height and density makes most sense.

216
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:22,850
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've thought before that I'd really love to see some increased height along 93 so we can kind of kill two birds with one stone.

217
00:35:25,213 --> 00:35:32,998
[SPEAKER_10]: adding some development potential while blocking some noise from 93 for the residential and business areas that are closer to the square or bordering the highway.

218
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:46,427
[SPEAKER_10]: On the matter of the traffic patterns, I think most folks on this call, whether they're counselors or community members, already know that through zoning, we cannot and we won't directly change traffic patterns.

219
00:35:47,007 --> 00:35:52,151
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that you know that, Councilor Lemming, I'm just stating that for the record for in case there's any newer to zoning folks on the call.

220
00:35:53,592 --> 00:35:54,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that that's what you're suggesting.

221
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:04,500
[SPEAKER_10]: I think is the the question is kind of like forecasting ahead for feel free to clarify.

222
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, sorry, that was phrased terribly.

223
00:36:08,302 --> 00:36:10,004
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to basically.

224
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that the traffic patterns in Medford square terrible.

225
00:36:14,784 --> 00:36:20,651
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like at some point in the future to explore changing those traffic patterns.

226
00:36:21,172 --> 00:36:25,077
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not up to it's that's not under the purview of zoning at all.

227
00:36:25,097 --> 00:36:30,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but I'm wondering if the, if the current zoning.

228
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:38,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if anybody from planning can generally comment on that, like, if we were to have, like, some change in the traffic pattern to Medford square with the zoning.

229
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, how would that interact with zoning?

230
00:36:40,707 --> 00:36:43,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, would it would like it make would.

231
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Increased height there make it more difficult to change that in the future.

232
00:36:48,183 --> 00:36:51,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, would it be.

233
00:36:52,267 --> 00:37:02,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Would it be necessary to change the traffic patterns if we're finding like, more cars coming through just just like some somebody that knows more than me talking about traffic patterns, I think would be would be helpful.

234
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:07,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, particularly like the high and main street intersection.

235
00:37:08,421 --> 00:37:08,562
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

236
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:10,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

237
00:37:10,871 --> 00:37:13,654
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll go to Planner Evans and then Councilor Callahan.

238
00:37:14,635 --> 00:37:29,288
[SPEAKER_10]: I do just want to note kind of at the beginning of this discussion, or kind of whenever we're talking about like traffic patterns and zoning changes at the same time, I think it's wise to enter into that discussion, not assuming that development

239
00:37:29,668 --> 00:37:43,820
[SPEAKER_10]: that increases in development will always necessarily at every step of the way also result in increases in car traffic, especially since we're considering policies such as TDM, transportation demand management, at the same time as zoning.

240
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,982
[SPEAKER_10]: This can interact with traffic patterns in

241
00:37:48,043 --> 00:37:55,290
[SPEAKER_10]: In many ways, it's not a 1 to 1 relationship, so I think this is going to be 1 of those incredibly multifactorial things.

242
00:37:55,450 --> 00:38:00,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I would think that the short answer would be zoning would not.

243
00:38:01,997 --> 00:38:06,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Directly overlay onto our ability to update our future traffic patterns because.

244
00:38:08,151 --> 00:38:13,554
[SPEAKER_10]: eminent domain taking of public lands that are used for our roadways, and a lot of our roadways leading into Medford Square are state roads.

245
00:38:14,694 --> 00:38:24,499
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to have the same land mass available for traffic lanes that we could design however we wish if we had the millions of dollars required to do that.

246
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:28,700
[SPEAKER_10]: But I will go over to Planner Evans for a response and then Councilor Callahan.

247
00:38:31,222 --> 00:38:31,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

248
00:38:32,422 --> 00:38:34,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Daniel Evans, Senior Planner, PDS.

249
00:38:35,115 --> 00:38:38,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's something that we have been thinking about.

250
00:38:38,037 --> 00:38:48,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at a conference last fall, and one of the sessions that was really interesting was how one-way traffic is super bad for economic development.

251
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:58,830
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it was Hyannis on Cape Cod actually undid all of their one-ways and made them two-ways.

252
00:38:59,531 --> 00:39:01,532
[SPEAKER_03]: And it actually showed that it didn't increase

253
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:14,356
[SPEAKER_03]: like traffic as in any, you know, causing delays, it actually resulted in less circling less vehicular miles traveled by the cars.

254
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:16,920
[SPEAKER_03]: It increased.

255
00:39:19,545 --> 00:39:24,947
[SPEAKER_03]: visibility of certain businesses, because if you're only going one way, you're never going by that one.

256
00:39:25,107 --> 00:39:35,571
[SPEAKER_03]: So, for example, Riverside, the portion in the square where you can only pass through it if you're going eastbound.

257
00:39:36,411 --> 00:39:43,854
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyone who's going westbound through the square, but then comes back another way, never ever goes past Salem Street.

258
00:39:45,338 --> 00:39:58,668
[SPEAKER_03]: So, as part of the, as I'm sure you're all aware of the Medford Square City parking lot RFP, I think changing the roads is on the table.

259
00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:02,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe a lot of these are city controlled.

260
00:40:04,853 --> 00:40:06,815
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a traffic engineer.

261
00:40:08,713 --> 00:40:12,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the amount of roads we have is probably okay.

262
00:40:12,816 --> 00:40:15,058
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the 1-way versus 2-way.

263
00:40:15,378 --> 00:40:18,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I very strongly feel that they should be 2-ways.

264
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:26,566
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I was king, I would also close the exit to 93 because I think we have too many.

265
00:40:27,547 --> 00:40:28,708
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is a huge problem.

266
00:40:30,789 --> 00:40:31,389
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know if...

267
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:47,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Director Hunt had anything to add on what is being discussed as part of the parking lot RFP and if they're asking any of those questions.

268
00:40:50,864 --> 00:40:51,964
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's all I have to add.

269
00:40:52,064 --> 00:40:58,947
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm super glad that Councilor Lemming brought that up because it's something I think about every day is the traffic patterns are terrible.

270
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:06,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for that planner Evans, Councillor Kelly and go ahead.

271
00:41:07,952 --> 00:41:08,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

272
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:13,475
[SPEAKER_14]: I also support and I'm curious about the idea of having height next to 93.

273
00:41:14,195 --> 00:41:16,336
[SPEAKER_14]: So in that parcel furthest to the east.

274
00:41:18,297 --> 00:41:21,419
[SPEAKER_14]: So I mentioned the answer to that question from the planners.

275
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:26,661
[SPEAKER_14]: I also want us to look at the parcel furthest to or the parcels furthest to the west.

276
00:41:27,782 --> 00:41:33,405
[SPEAKER_14]: When I look at the other map that you provided a number of meetings ago that shows the actual

277
00:41:34,605 --> 00:41:51,322
[SPEAKER_14]: Current zoning or not zoning but current like existing buildings that is marked as orange, which says condo conversion two to three family so I'm not sure exactly what buildings exist there at this moment that did not seem.

278
00:41:51,562 --> 00:41:53,863
[SPEAKER_14]: to go drive with my recollection of what buildings are there.

279
00:41:54,484 --> 00:41:57,145
[SPEAKER_14]: But like understanding what height is there right now would be helpful.

280
00:41:58,046 --> 00:42:04,930
[SPEAKER_14]: It does, you know, that whole section abuts on multiple single family or like currently mostly single family places.

281
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:19,859
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm a little bit curious about can we get more height close to 93 and maybe get something on the other side that's a little bit closer to match the residences that are just to the west and north of it.

282
00:42:25,562 --> 00:42:26,123
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, yes.

283
00:42:26,563 --> 00:42:34,230
[SPEAKER_18]: If I may answer some of this, um, so about the, I'm going to go by, um, order.

284
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:49,623
[SPEAKER_18]: So to do something in the, to increase to MX three, the really far, um, the, the, yeah, the furthest East, um, parcels.

285
00:42:51,227 --> 00:42:58,152
[SPEAKER_18]: So these are very, very narrow and we don't have a lot of space between the 93 and the City Hall.

286
00:42:58,172 --> 00:43:05,497
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm really afraid we would need to do really a little bit more of the studies.

287
00:43:05,617 --> 00:43:06,938
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have any section there.

288
00:43:07,038 --> 00:43:09,880
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would, before saying yes,

289
00:43:10,913 --> 00:43:11,613
[SPEAKER_18]: we can do that.

290
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:20,899
[SPEAKER_18]: I really need to study a little bit more, because I think that it will have quite an impact.

291
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:34,648
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't, I don't feel that we would like to recommend any kind of wall that you see there from these houses that what you see, it's immediately a block of 10 stories high.

292
00:43:34,668 --> 00:43:36,769
[SPEAKER_18]: So let's

293
00:43:39,846 --> 00:43:46,629
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to do a little bit more study, especially on the on the on the narrowest part of those parcels.

294
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:50,311
[SPEAKER_18]: We could extend it a little bit more, but but I'm not sure.

295
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:51,271
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Matt.

296
00:43:55,153 --> 00:43:55,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead, Councilwoman.

297
00:43:57,816 --> 00:44:12,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, I mean, just on the, just on the, the concept of the view from the houses, just to the, uh, uh, just to the right of that, it, it doesn't really provide those houses don't really get much review anyway.

298
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I mean, I lived there, we're mostly looking at the highway.

299
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:21,581
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just, just kind of put that thought out there that I don't think that that, uh, I don't think any mentioned those houses at all.

300
00:44:22,601 --> 00:44:22,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

301
00:44:25,036 --> 00:44:39,082
[SPEAKER_09]: But would it also be possible to, like, I only see that part of that is, is it possible to just take maybe the south part of that parcel and make it into MX3?

302
00:44:40,082 --> 00:44:45,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Because one part does seem kind of narrow, but the other part seems a little bit more beefy.

303
00:44:47,165 --> 00:44:52,587
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so if I may, yeah, so we can look at that.

304
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:59,607
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, if we go quite high, we need to provide parking somehow.

305
00:45:00,908 --> 00:45:03,470
[SPEAKER_18]: So obviously, we are going higher density.

306
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,371
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have depth enough.

307
00:45:06,712 --> 00:45:08,073
[SPEAKER_18]: That's something that we need to think about.

308
00:45:08,133 --> 00:45:13,057
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's a good question.

309
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:16,900
[SPEAKER_18]: We need a little bit more research to answer that specific one.

310
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:20,823
[SPEAKER_18]: We are permitting at this point six by right

311
00:45:21,444 --> 00:45:28,527
[SPEAKER_18]: up to two more, so we are looking at eight stories, so it's going to be already high to block noise, etc.

312
00:45:30,148 --> 00:45:39,672
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see if it's feasible to propose to that jump to mix three, so we will look at that.

313
00:45:42,383 --> 00:45:52,130
[SPEAKER_18]: Then for the other question about the traffic, so of course, yes, the traffic patterns is something that is something different from zoning.

314
00:45:52,731 --> 00:45:57,835
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, would it affect zoning that we change the patterns of the traffic?

315
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:02,218
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's two ways or one way, that doesn't really affect what we are doing.

316
00:46:03,859 --> 00:46:07,102
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's cutting some streets or

317
00:46:08,674 --> 00:46:21,199
[SPEAKER_18]: It could be that maybe the uses we would if we have something residential and then we cut a street and it's pedestrian maybe we would like to do some commercial on the ground floor, so it could.

318
00:46:23,345 --> 00:46:24,526
[SPEAKER_18]: It could do something like that.

319
00:46:24,586 --> 00:46:26,786
[SPEAKER_18]: But what we're proposing here is mixed use.

320
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:36,250
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's quite flexible for the future to do or all residential building or mixed use building.

321
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:38,351
[SPEAKER_18]: Or a commercial building.

322
00:46:38,431 --> 00:46:41,932
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are given with the mixed use quite a lot of flexibility.

323
00:46:42,998 --> 00:46:54,183
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so I don't think that it would affect the changes in the traffic patterns a lot to what we're doing in the zoning and that if they change something in zoning should change.

324
00:46:55,025 --> 00:47:15,662
[SPEAKER_18]: what we can do is to, as we did for Salem Street and Mystic, is to talk to the Department of Public Works and see if there are any plans in the future or if they have any idea on whatever future possibilities that they are studying, if this would fit with that.

325
00:47:16,242 --> 00:47:21,827
[SPEAKER_18]: That's something that we could add that I think it's actually very interesting to do.

326
00:47:23,602 --> 00:47:35,505
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the last answer about these, now the west towards Winthrop Street, we have some sections, so I can tell you exactly what are those buildings.

327
00:47:36,185 --> 00:47:39,826
[SPEAKER_18]: The Condé Conversion 2-3, that's obviously not right.

328
00:47:41,966 --> 00:47:46,847
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm guessing that that's what you saw in the building typologies that we had from previous

329
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:55,920
[SPEAKER_18]: studies, but that comes from the assessor's data, so it can be that it's wrong.

330
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,781
[SPEAKER_18]: But these are multifamily.

331
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:59,181
[SPEAKER_18]: These are six stories high.

332
00:47:59,201 --> 00:48:08,365
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm looking at the planning and permitting agenda from the 12th of February, which is an amazing one because it included a lot of maps, and this is one of those maps.

333
00:48:08,445 --> 00:48:16,929
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just the one that shows like every parcel and what exists on that parcel, and it's marked as orange, which is condo conversion duty family.

334
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:17,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Not sure why.

335
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,342
[SPEAKER_18]: No, that is not correct.

336
00:48:20,422 --> 00:48:22,344
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are multifamily.

337
00:48:22,384 --> 00:48:24,726
[SPEAKER_18]: These are six-story high buildings.

338
00:48:26,127 --> 00:48:28,670
[SPEAKER_02]: If I might, they're six-story condos.

339
00:48:30,051 --> 00:48:32,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wonder if that's why they're marked that way.

340
00:48:32,594 --> 00:48:33,214
[SPEAKER_18]: As condo.

341
00:48:33,414 --> 00:48:34,255
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, could be.

342
00:48:34,275 --> 00:48:35,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

343
00:48:36,737 --> 00:48:37,298
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Alicia.

344
00:48:40,141 --> 00:48:40,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there any further questions?

345
00:48:41,101 --> 00:48:42,762
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a great catch, Councillor Callaghan.

346
00:48:42,802 --> 00:48:43,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for that.

347
00:48:43,422 --> 00:48:46,022
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you for running over those initial suggestions, Paola.

348
00:48:47,543 --> 00:49:02,786
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like there is interest in, you know, I think the point of these early discussions is to put these kind of ideas and suggestions out on the record, and then the consultant can follow up, look more deeply at the areas where we want to investigate a little bit further and get back to us with an answer on, you know, for example,

349
00:49:04,127 --> 00:49:18,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it feasible to consider a higher and more dense sub district for specific parcel it sounds like there's an interest in that being further investigated for a further meeting if it does turn out that it's confirmed that the lots

350
00:49:19,828 --> 00:49:29,572
[SPEAKER_10]: directly abutting 93 to the east of City Hall are really too narrow to accommodate mixed use three, then that'll be good information to have.

351
00:49:29,732 --> 00:49:39,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe the same is not quite true for that large kind of triangle-shaped parcel, but I think that that's a great thing for us to take out of this meeting as a point for future research.

352
00:49:39,856 --> 00:49:41,336
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for speaking to that.

353
00:49:42,117 --> 00:49:44,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Paola, I'll put that on my notes as well.

354
00:49:46,382 --> 00:49:55,926
[SPEAKER_10]: It is great to hear that potential traffic and roadway changes are being considered at the same time as respondents to the Medford Square RFP are being considered.

355
00:49:55,966 --> 00:50:04,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if improvements can be made faster than perhaps I pessimistically hoped, then I suspect that everybody would be happy about it.

356
00:50:06,487 --> 00:50:13,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Gosh, the Medford Square traffic really needs to be made slower and safer and better for actually enjoying the square.

357
00:50:14,529 --> 00:50:20,871
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have a lot of other views of this, and I'll go to Director Hahn first.

358
00:50:21,491 --> 00:50:34,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to take that moment to plug the fact that part of it is the interaction between the lights at Medford Square and then the South Medford, and DOT has just announced

359
00:50:35,126 --> 00:50:42,351
[SPEAKER_02]: a 25% design meeting in April in the Medford City Council Chambers on that project.

360
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:46,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think that anybody who's caring about that is gonna care about this.

361
00:50:47,093 --> 00:50:49,035
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm gonna scroll real quick.

362
00:50:49,075 --> 00:50:50,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's April 23rd.

363
00:50:51,436 --> 00:50:54,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And as of right now, there is no online option for it.

364
00:50:54,878 --> 00:50:58,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what, I'm not involved in organizing it.

365
00:50:58,481 --> 00:51:02,403
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, it's Wednesday the 23rd at six o'clock in the Council Chambers.

366
00:51:03,008 --> 00:51:04,069
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk about it.

367
00:51:04,689 --> 00:51:11,092
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't remember if it actually touches the light at Medford Square or just everything right up to it.

368
00:51:13,262 --> 00:51:13,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

369
00:51:13,702 --> 00:51:14,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much, Director Hunt.

370
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:20,804
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great to know, and we'll be sure to find that link so councillors can further promote.

371
00:51:20,824 --> 00:51:22,865
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a big deal.

372
00:51:22,965 --> 00:51:26,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Changing the signaling would be a really big deal for traffic in and out of the square.

373
00:51:27,246 --> 00:51:29,867
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know we have many other diagrams that Paola has prepared for us.

374
00:51:29,927 --> 00:51:35,228
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to make sure that we have time to look at them, respond to them, and also talk about the updates to the ADU ordinance.

375
00:51:36,588 --> 00:51:40,349
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's proceed through the presentation, Paola, please.

376
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:42,290
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, if I may.

377
00:51:44,719 --> 00:52:01,171
[SPEAKER_18]: So we did a set of sections to explain, to see the relationship between the street profile and the building, especially when we start changing the heights.

378
00:52:03,473 --> 00:52:06,175
[SPEAKER_18]: A section is as if we just cut through

379
00:52:06,863 --> 00:52:14,826
[SPEAKER_18]: the building and like if we have a cake, we cut the cake, we see what is inside and we see those layers.

380
00:52:15,306 --> 00:52:16,447
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what we are doing here.

381
00:52:16,507 --> 00:52:31,032
[SPEAKER_18]: We just cut through the buildings and the street to see what do we have in that plane and how it relates the section of the street with the buildings.

382
00:52:32,203 --> 00:52:47,175
[SPEAKER_18]: So the existing section of High Street, that's section one in here, we have the Mystic River on the southern part, what we see now on the west.

383
00:52:48,256 --> 00:52:57,303
[SPEAKER_18]: There are a lot of historical buildings all around the Medford Square, but these are really grouped in this area.

384
00:52:57,963 --> 00:52:59,685
[SPEAKER_18]: They go from one, two, three,

385
00:53:00,421 --> 00:53:02,623
[SPEAKER_18]: There's only one that goes up to four stories.

386
00:53:03,243 --> 00:53:07,006
[SPEAKER_18]: And then in front, that is a very low level, all commercial.

387
00:53:08,867 --> 00:53:20,675
[SPEAKER_18]: And so if we look at the shadow as well, which is very important, if we go higher than the four, we will start casting shadow onto the other building.

388
00:53:21,796 --> 00:53:28,821
[SPEAKER_18]: So in order to keep that not shading the buildings,

389
00:53:29,563 --> 00:53:36,385
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, that's why we propose that MX one in this area and then the other side can go up to six.

390
00:53:37,265 --> 00:53:41,186
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, at this point in these exactly location, we have a parking behind.

391
00:53:41,786 --> 00:53:49,988
[SPEAKER_18]: So other measures of, um, how these buildings should be shaped in order to not cast shadow.

392
00:53:50,128 --> 00:53:57,550
[SPEAKER_18]: If there is some, uh, another residential complex or another mixed use building, or if it's a parking, it will depend on the design.

393
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:04,234
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, if we continue to high street, and these are the ones and Callahan was mentioned.

394
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,155
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we have from.

395
00:54:06,936 --> 00:54:08,477
[SPEAKER_18]: From that, um.

396
00:54:10,258 --> 00:54:20,566
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's say from the school from this area after the mixed use one that we had in the plan, there is a drop between high street and then Parkway.

397
00:54:20,586 --> 00:54:20,626
[SPEAKER_18]: Um.

398
00:54:28,005 --> 00:54:29,806
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the Mystic Valley Parkway, sorry.

399
00:54:31,207 --> 00:54:32,387
[SPEAKER_18]: So there is quite a drop.

400
00:54:32,468 --> 00:54:34,188
[SPEAKER_18]: We have almost like two stories.

401
00:54:34,248 --> 00:54:38,471
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we see from High Street, our buildings are four stories high.

402
00:54:40,292 --> 00:54:42,813
[SPEAKER_18]: But in reality, they are six stories high.

403
00:54:43,414 --> 00:54:49,557
[SPEAKER_18]: So the first section that you see, the upper one, is going to be the existing section, what we have right now.

404
00:54:50,193 --> 00:54:55,795
[SPEAKER_18]: And then what you see beneath those are usually a proposed section.

405
00:54:55,835 --> 00:55:00,156
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we have different proposals, we have version one, version two.

406
00:55:01,397 --> 00:55:02,197
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have six.

407
00:55:02,637 --> 00:55:09,499
[SPEAKER_18]: The residentials in front are also a little bit elevated, around three foot elevated.

408
00:55:10,739 --> 00:55:13,640
[SPEAKER_18]: That makes it also that it's not so into

409
00:55:19,588 --> 00:55:27,270
[SPEAKER_18]: in, how do you say it, that it doesn't cast shadow on them, that it's a little bit more light.

410
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:32,191
[SPEAKER_18]: And yeah, that breeds the building a little bit more.

411
00:55:32,471 --> 00:55:34,092
[SPEAKER_18]: It's also because it's a little bit up.

412
00:55:34,592 --> 00:55:38,413
[SPEAKER_18]: So here the topography helps a lot to densify.

413
00:55:38,953 --> 00:55:43,014
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have a proposed section where we add two more with a step back.

414
00:55:43,736 --> 00:55:48,562
[SPEAKER_18]: still the shadow is really not important.

415
00:55:49,163 --> 00:55:51,406
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't cast shadow on the neighbors.

416
00:55:52,688 --> 00:55:56,713
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have that proposed section of going up to eight.

417
00:55:57,394 --> 00:55:59,076
[SPEAKER_18]: So six by right plus two.

418
00:56:00,189 --> 00:56:17,073
[SPEAKER_18]: And we do have another proposal where if we really want to densify this area, we don't have to add more, but if we start covering the parking and we add this, we take, we profit from the topography change and we have this

419
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:28,723
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, we build this two layers of parking of cover parking, then we can build on top another six of residential and we can also build on the other side.

420
00:56:28,783 --> 00:56:37,425
[SPEAKER_18]: So when we are starting to go really higher on the density, it starts to be feasible to construct a covered parking.

421
00:56:37,965 --> 00:56:45,147
[SPEAKER_18]: So in this way, that area, especially, which are very, very deep will allow for, um,

422
00:56:47,572 --> 00:56:48,652
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot more buildings.

423
00:56:49,192 --> 00:56:55,834
[SPEAKER_18]: At this point, they are little islands in a sea of asphalt, of parking, nothing happening, really not.

424
00:56:58,434 --> 00:57:00,135
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing is activating this area.

425
00:57:00,775 --> 00:57:16,138
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we have this a little bit more density allowing, we could actually build more around parking, hidden, and so that this area will become a lot more interesting facing the street.

426
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:20,263
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so this is the second.

427
00:57:20,423 --> 00:57:27,385
[SPEAKER_18]: The V2 is the proposal that we also provide and that will be possible with this zoning.

428
00:57:29,706 --> 00:57:34,388
[SPEAKER_18]: If we go around, so now we are in section three Winthrop Street.

429
00:57:35,909 --> 00:57:42,791
[SPEAKER_18]: So right now in this area, there are seven levels depending on where we are.

430
00:57:42,991 --> 00:57:44,932
[SPEAKER_18]: This, for example, is seven layers.

431
00:57:45,392 --> 00:57:46,312
[SPEAKER_18]: The previous one was six.

432
00:57:48,618 --> 00:57:50,359
[SPEAKER_18]: And it really cast a long shadow.

433
00:57:50,379 --> 00:57:52,040
[SPEAKER_18]: This is going to be east.

434
00:57:53,161 --> 00:57:56,703
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's only on the morning that will provide the shadow.

435
00:57:56,983 --> 00:58:01,185
[SPEAKER_18]: After that, it won't bother any of the neighbors on the other side of Winthrop.

436
00:58:02,885 --> 00:58:20,418
[SPEAKER_18]: So we could go up to six or eight, but we always really need and push it more towards the, instead of having a big parking as they have right now, and the street, we could push the buildings more towards the street, but then we need to be very careful on casting the shadow, et cetera.

437
00:58:20,479 --> 00:58:26,543
[SPEAKER_18]: So some studies of shading should be done for this proposal from this area.

438
00:58:26,623 --> 00:58:31,067
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we want to include in the draft is that whenever you,

439
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:31,900
[SPEAKER_18]: Um.

440
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,483
[SPEAKER_18]: The developer goes up to the incentives owning the story.

441
00:58:35,523 --> 00:58:43,329
[SPEAKER_18]: So when they're taking that plus one plus two that they have to do a shadow, um, study so to see if.

442
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:50,595
[SPEAKER_18]: They are going to bother the and that the building is shaped in ways that are not bothering the existing

443
00:58:59,655 --> 00:59:09,218
[SPEAKER_18]: in one side is High Street, in the other side is Mystic Valley Parkway, and then we have park, a little bit of park, and then the Mystic River.

444
00:59:10,238 --> 00:59:23,062
[SPEAKER_18]: It would be very interesting that what we could do is also take advantage of that topography drop, putting some parking in there, and then having some commercial towards the park.

445
00:59:24,107 --> 00:59:37,814
[SPEAKER_18]: that's the reddish color, that's always going to mean the commercial, retail, or active ground floor, which can be up to two levels, and that it will serve that park.

446
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:50,061
[SPEAKER_18]: There is like a canoe area in here that they can rent, so it would be interesting to activate a little bit more that area and to give a front, a built-in front towards that.

447
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:56,601
[SPEAKER_18]: we can also go up to eight stories high with those two being incentive zoning.

448
00:59:59,222 --> 01:00:00,883
[SPEAKER_18]: Now we go to Salem Street.

449
01:00:02,144 --> 01:00:03,465
[SPEAKER_18]: This is section five.

450
01:00:06,226 --> 01:00:08,447
[SPEAKER_18]: So in here we have small logs.

451
01:00:09,688 --> 01:00:15,651
[SPEAKER_18]: This small triangle, there is not a lot of depth to really go higher.

452
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,581
[SPEAKER_18]: So let's say that this is the Bayreuth 4.

453
01:00:19,721 --> 01:00:23,183
[SPEAKER_18]: It will cast the shadow towards the building in front.

454
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:28,425
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the south area, the south building in here.

455
01:00:29,065 --> 01:00:34,468
[SPEAKER_18]: So we can go a little bit higher and then be careful with how high we go because of the shadows.

456
01:00:34,928 --> 01:00:39,790
[SPEAKER_18]: And on the other side, we can easily go up to the six stories high.

457
01:00:41,052 --> 01:00:52,259
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, if you go to Clippership, Doctor, so this is the long parcel, um, at the, um, along the Clippership Road, uh, Doctor.

458
01:00:52,279 --> 01:01:00,444
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, if we see that this is the Mystic, we have the Mystic in, in, on the right.

459
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:09,149
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, what we have now, it's a lot of road, uh, parking, another internal road, more parking, and then the building.

460
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:14,023
[SPEAKER_18]: making it very far away from really the park and the river.

461
01:01:14,443 --> 01:01:15,904
[SPEAKER_18]: There is really disconnected.

462
01:01:16,364 --> 01:01:32,374
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we try to do is give a lot of more height so that we can really start going a little bit back, but really connecting and giving an active ground floor to that side of the clipper ship.

463
01:01:33,162 --> 01:01:40,146
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and then always being mindful that towards Riverside Avenue, this lot will cast a lot of shadow.

464
01:01:40,586 --> 01:01:49,591
[SPEAKER_18]: So there is this idea of having the parking inside, ground floor active towards both of the streets, so we want to keep both streets active.

465
01:01:50,392 --> 01:02:02,078
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and then being mindful that that building can be shifted with setbacks in different areas so that it's not very

466
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:11,746
[SPEAKER_18]: um, imposing on people walking and passing by, but also that is, um, respectful with the shadows, et cetera.

467
01:02:12,966 --> 01:02:16,688
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so at this point right now, the existing is only one story.

468
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:20,289
[SPEAKER_18]: We think that in this area, it can totally grow a lot.

469
01:02:20,689 --> 01:02:27,192
[SPEAKER_18]: We can also have space for parking in between cover parking and making really active both sides.

470
01:02:29,105 --> 01:02:34,007
[SPEAKER_18]: Porter Road is really up towards the single-family district.

471
01:02:34,467 --> 01:02:39,328
[SPEAKER_18]: It also has a drop on the topography.

472
01:02:39,748 --> 01:02:41,389
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is the existing section.

473
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:47,851
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't do any new one because this is enough to see for the stories that we can make.

474
01:02:48,651 --> 01:02:54,233
[SPEAKER_18]: In this area, we have a lot of historic buildings, so we want to keep them as they are.

475
01:02:54,943 --> 01:02:56,905
[SPEAKER_18]: of protecting the historical buildings.

476
01:02:57,465 --> 01:03:04,732
[SPEAKER_18]: And this, for example, was already six stories high, and then just taking advantage of that jump of topography.

477
01:03:07,134 --> 01:03:08,275
[SPEAKER_18]: We did a new one.

478
01:03:08,295 --> 01:03:08,335
[SPEAKER_18]: So

479
01:03:11,428 --> 01:03:27,440
[SPEAKER_18]: The city asked if we could check those heights and really go lower towards Clippership and higher on the Riverside Avenue and Salem Street so that different areas could have a look onto the river.

480
01:03:28,101 --> 01:03:30,503
[SPEAKER_18]: So we did that section and that analysis.

481
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:45,392
[SPEAKER_18]: To be honest, that's very difficult to get, because even if we go low in Clipperside or Riverside Avenue, the view to the river, it's really difficult.

482
01:03:46,692 --> 01:03:52,934
[SPEAKER_18]: So we still recommend to have always looking at the shadows.

483
01:03:55,765 --> 01:04:02,492
[SPEAKER_18]: South side of the street should be lower than the north side of the street because of that casting shadow.

484
01:04:03,754 --> 01:04:14,125
[SPEAKER_18]: And then trying always to have the inner area for parking and letting the active ground floor along the streets.

485
01:04:16,495 --> 01:04:27,360
[SPEAKER_18]: We can go higher to two floors of commercial if that's something that we want.

486
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:33,102
[SPEAKER_18]: We also believe that this area of the southern part, there is a very big lot.

487
01:04:33,222 --> 01:04:36,664
[SPEAKER_18]: It has a lot of depth and it has a lot of opportunity.

488
01:04:37,224 --> 01:04:41,866
[SPEAKER_18]: And that means that if we give height, we can also get back a lot for the community.

489
01:04:42,766 --> 01:04:56,859
[SPEAKER_18]: So we could have those pocket parks or squares or seating areas that we have in our incentive list, so that it will make and that is strengthened between the Mystic and the buildings.

490
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:06,108
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is really one strong reason to go really higher also on the south of Riverside Avenue.

491
01:05:08,585 --> 01:05:11,566
[SPEAKER_18]: So here we had all these studies and sections.

492
01:05:11,626 --> 01:05:15,046
[SPEAKER_18]: We will send this if I don't think you will have it.

493
01:05:15,526 --> 01:05:19,007
[SPEAKER_18]: So we will send it and really hope for all your comments.

494
01:05:20,147 --> 01:05:24,028
[SPEAKER_18]: These are not the architecture that will come.

495
01:05:24,048 --> 01:05:28,528
[SPEAKER_18]: This is just proposals of things that could happen and could be.

496
01:05:29,069 --> 01:05:32,109
[SPEAKER_18]: This is in no way an image of what it's going to be.

497
01:05:33,189 --> 01:05:36,830
[SPEAKER_18]: But these are the opportunities that we could have with this zoning.

498
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:40,034
[SPEAKER_18]: wanted to leave that clear.

499
01:05:40,914 --> 01:05:41,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

500
01:05:41,775 --> 01:05:42,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much, Paola.

501
01:05:42,816 --> 01:05:45,638
[SPEAKER_10]: This is certainly a lot to digest.

502
01:05:45,678 --> 01:05:50,522
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a great jumping off point for our discussion of Medford Square.

503
01:05:50,562 --> 01:05:54,085
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know this will feed into our discussion of West Medford Square as well.

504
01:05:55,906 --> 01:06:03,052
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've had the chance to look at a bunch of these kind of snapshot section views from around the square.

505
01:06:03,872 --> 01:06:13,337
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that this could be a great opportunity to get counselors and city staff's initial impressions and questions and more suggestions like we had just earlier.

506
01:06:13,357 --> 01:06:19,040
[SPEAKER_10]: And then of course, as counselors and community members have additional feedback we can be

507
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:22,381
[SPEAKER_10]: taking that in between these meetings as well.

508
01:06:22,601 --> 01:06:25,282
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thank you for that last note that you made, Paola.

509
01:06:25,402 --> 01:06:31,225
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's always helpful to keep re-emphasizing what we mean when we look at these maps and when we talk about zoning.

510
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:33,926
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the way that you put it was really well.

511
01:06:34,046 --> 01:06:36,067
[SPEAKER_10]: When we look at the zoning map, this is not

512
01:06:36,907 --> 01:06:41,190
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, one, this is a proposal, this is a draft, I'm sure this will change before it is something that we vote on.

513
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:49,734
[SPEAKER_10]: But also, this is not a map of what the square will absolutely look like, even if this zoning were to be adopted.

514
01:06:49,754 --> 01:06:55,358
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a map of one version of what could be made possible.

515
01:06:55,418 --> 01:07:06,344
[SPEAKER_10]: So even when we say, you know, this could go up to eight, this could go up to 12, this could go up to six, that's depending on if developers are trying to develop just within what's by right, or if they're taking advantage of incentive zoning,

516
01:07:06,952 --> 01:07:17,360
[SPEAKER_10]: to a certain degree, to maximum, to minimum, not that under this new zoning, every building shall be a certain height, setting a minimum and a maximum.

517
01:07:18,641 --> 01:07:20,683
[SPEAKER_10]: With that, I'll go to comments and questions from councillors.

518
01:07:20,743 --> 01:07:21,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Councillor Callahan, please go ahead.

519
01:07:21,884 --> 01:07:22,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

520
01:07:24,937 --> 01:07:29,142
[SPEAKER_14]: I really appreciated those look at the heights and the shadows.

521
01:07:30,063 --> 01:07:34,868
[SPEAKER_14]: The one that I was curious about was the Salem Street one.

522
01:07:36,109 --> 01:07:45,479
[SPEAKER_14]: It does appear that all of the others covered where the shadows would be on the north side for Salem Street.

523
01:07:46,681 --> 01:07:50,704
[SPEAKER_14]: How does it work as we're looking north of Salem Street?

524
01:07:51,084 --> 01:07:58,229
[SPEAKER_14]: When we look at the housing that's north of Salem Street, and there's a road there, how does that?

525
01:07:59,269 --> 01:08:00,290
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that wasn't covered.

526
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:02,632
[SPEAKER_14]: Almost everything else, it covers what happens.

527
01:08:05,834 --> 01:08:12,858
[SPEAKER_14]: But those buildings, which we're changing on the left side that you're circling right now, what about the housing that is on the other side of that?

528
01:08:14,179 --> 01:08:15,260
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I'm curious about.

529
01:08:17,689 --> 01:08:42,005
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, so for any of the residential district, we had this on Salem Street and also, yeah, I think we added in Salem Street draft where there is, we will have some extra setback, added setback from a residential towards a mixed use area or commercial.

530
01:08:42,926 --> 01:08:45,928
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we had this transition

531
01:08:46,725 --> 01:08:51,630
[SPEAKER_18]: in 45 degree so that the heights cannot be against the houses.

532
01:08:53,551 --> 01:09:07,404
[SPEAKER_18]: When we bring again the draft, I will also implement that so we understand that we are always protecting the transition between residential towards these higher buildings.

533
01:09:09,065 --> 01:09:09,425
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.

534
01:09:09,946 --> 01:09:10,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks so much.

535
01:09:13,053 --> 01:09:13,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

536
01:09:13,373 --> 01:09:15,035
[SPEAKER_10]: I see a couple hands.

537
01:09:15,075 --> 01:09:15,455
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

538
01:09:15,495 --> 01:09:27,327
[SPEAKER_10]: I totally forgot to say this at the end of the meeting or sorry at the beginning of the meeting will take all public participation on this topic after counselors conclude their comments, then we'll move on to 80 years and we'll take all public participation on 80 years at that time.

539
01:09:27,367 --> 01:09:28,968
[SPEAKER_10]: So please hang tight.

540
01:09:29,409 --> 01:09:29,989
[SPEAKER_10]: We will get to you.

541
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:31,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Um.

542
01:09:32,391 --> 01:09:36,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing no other counselors hands raised right now.

543
01:09:37,295 --> 01:09:45,582
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to put a couple of my own comments on the records on the for some of these specific sections.

544
01:09:46,502 --> 01:09:49,084
[SPEAKER_10]: That we looked at in general.

545
01:09:49,144 --> 01:09:52,046
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that this framework is about right.

546
01:09:52,207 --> 01:09:58,612
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure that we will massage some of where some of the sub districts start and end as we continue to iterate on this.

547
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:03,996
[SPEAKER_10]: including some of the suggestions that have already been made tonight.

548
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:20,311
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to note, I find it particularly exciting what the consultants are bringing forward around how we can use these like topography changes and the slope of the earth below our buildings to our advantage when it comes to

549
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:27,754
[SPEAKER_10]: creating more potential for development and also hiding parking.

550
01:10:27,774 --> 01:10:30,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Like for example, yeah Paola knew exactly what I was talking about.

551
01:10:31,237 --> 01:10:41,945
[SPEAKER_10]: These places where we can use the slope of the land to our advantage to add height in a way that does not feel like you're adding height in bulk from for in this example High Street.

552
01:10:42,766 --> 01:10:43,246
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can

553
01:10:44,307 --> 01:10:49,331
[SPEAKER_10]: have two more additional floors and it doesn't feel like two more additional floors from the pedestrian's perspective.

554
01:10:49,371 --> 01:10:50,192
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's great.

555
01:10:51,273 --> 01:10:55,756
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that especially when we're considering like the south side of High Street to Mystic Valley Parkway.

556
01:10:55,776 --> 01:11:09,767
[SPEAKER_10]: I know for myself I'm so used to seeing those parking lots kind of right along the parkway in front of the river that it's hard for me to even to imagine those being destinations instead of just parking.

557
01:11:10,208 --> 01:11:12,730
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm particularly enamored by version two

558
01:11:13,516 --> 01:11:16,099
[SPEAKER_10]: for the south side of High Street and for Mystic Valley Parkway.

559
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:21,565
[SPEAKER_10]: We know that we need parking to, you know, parking has a big role in the square.

560
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:24,528
[SPEAKER_10]: It is where a lot of our city's major destinations are.

561
01:11:25,549 --> 01:11:27,732
[SPEAKER_10]: We need people to be able to drive and park there.

562
01:11:28,192 --> 01:11:29,554
[SPEAKER_10]: And we also really do want to be

563
01:11:30,468 --> 01:11:38,015
[SPEAKER_10]: using more of our, I think we want to be using more of our land area for giving people places to live and stuff to do and companies and offices to visit.

564
01:11:38,075 --> 01:11:45,721
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will be, I just wanted to throw my support behind version two for this particular section and then for the south side of High Street as well.

565
01:11:45,761 --> 01:11:51,326
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's a really smart way to be using our topography.

566
01:11:53,186 --> 01:11:56,007
[SPEAKER_10]: And in general, I know this is brought up for Clippership Drive as well.

567
01:11:56,187 --> 01:12:03,810
[SPEAKER_10]: I think in general, hiding parking is a great idea because it allows us to keep our building frontages exciting and full of places that people can walk into.

568
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:12,913
[SPEAKER_10]: The only kind of question that I think I'll have going forward is, and I'm not sure if this is really an answerable question or if this is something that will vary development by development,

569
01:12:13,473 --> 01:12:27,116
[SPEAKER_10]: is when we're talking about putting parking inside of a building, how does that impact the actual usable, rentable, inhabitable space within that floor map or within that parcel?

570
01:12:28,416 --> 01:12:33,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Though as I think more about it, it seems that that's probably more of a economic consideration on the developer side.

571
01:12:34,478 --> 01:12:35,678
[SPEAKER_10]: But I just want to make sure that we're not

572
01:12:38,299 --> 01:12:43,601
[SPEAKER_10]: trading, useful commercial and residential space for parking, whether it's inside or outside of a building envelope.

573
01:12:48,283 --> 01:12:58,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Having put that on the record, are there any other additional comments, suggestions, references from Councillors on the maps that we have looked at so far tonight?

574
01:12:58,808 --> 01:13:02,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Things that we want our consultants to be keeping in mind as these are being revised for our next meeting.

575
01:13:08,941 --> 01:13:12,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing none, we've got a couple great ideas on the record already.

576
01:13:12,644 --> 01:13:23,933
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, councillors can always contact the zoning consultant with ideas, either via me as committee chair, Director Hunt in between meetings.

577
01:13:25,935 --> 01:13:30,839
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, seeing no further comment from councillors, I will go to public participation on this item.

578
01:13:31,678 --> 01:13:32,659
[SPEAKER_10]: I will call on you.

579
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:35,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead, Councilor Callahan.

580
01:13:36,201 --> 01:13:40,224
[SPEAKER_14]: I am just curious that the cemetery lot is zoned as mixed use.

581
01:13:45,407 --> 01:13:47,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just comment on that.

582
01:13:47,348 --> 01:13:49,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, we just zoned the whole area.

583
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:52,932
[SPEAKER_02]: The reality is that the cemetery lot isn't protected.

584
01:13:56,038 --> 01:14:00,601
[SPEAKER_02]: It's protected with all kinds of historic things, and it could never actually be developed.

585
01:14:00,681 --> 01:14:02,603
[SPEAKER_02]: It just needed to go into one of them.

586
01:14:03,884 --> 01:14:23,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I think the consultants had that whole block as the mixed-use 2A, and I had recommended that we go a little higher because next to that is the parking lot that is the parking garage and the medical use, and they have so much space and it's owned by one entity.

587
01:14:24,318 --> 01:14:28,100
[SPEAKER_02]: that they actually could go higher next to the cemetery.

588
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:39,045
[SPEAKER_02]: So honestly, I thought they would just flip the whole block to be 2B because we can't, the reality is nobody could ever touch that cemetery with all the protections on it.

589
01:14:39,605 --> 01:14:41,726
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't really matter what we zone it.

590
01:14:42,346 --> 01:14:43,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, wonderful, thank you.

591
01:14:44,815 --> 01:14:48,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you for the question, Councilor Gallahan, and thank you for the answer, Director Hunt.

592
01:14:49,298 --> 01:14:51,059
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I'll go to public participation.

593
01:14:51,079 --> 01:14:57,963
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll ask you to unmute on Zoom, give your name and address for the record, and then each participant will have three minutes.

594
01:14:59,024 --> 01:15:00,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Dave, go ahead, name and address for the record, please.

595
01:15:03,566 --> 01:15:04,987
[SPEAKER_07]: David McKenna to Vine Street.

596
01:15:06,608 --> 01:15:11,951
[SPEAKER_07]: I live about a five-minute walk from City Hall, so I'm excited about this new redevelopment.

597
01:15:13,549 --> 01:15:30,665
[SPEAKER_07]: that the areas that we've seen in the proposal that are four stories along Salem Street on the south side, along High Street on the south side, and the entire three plus one section around the police station south of Mystic Valley Parkway.

598
01:15:31,165 --> 01:15:35,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like that's a missed opportunity, particularly south of Mystic Valley Parkway.

599
01:15:35,509 --> 01:15:37,271
[SPEAKER_07]: That's already zoned for, I believe,

600
01:15:39,823 --> 01:15:44,426
[SPEAKER_07]: A max of 12 stories and then right next to it is a max of 4. it doesn't really make sense.

601
01:15:44,446 --> 01:15:46,228
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an industrial area and.

602
01:15:47,028 --> 01:15:52,753
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think that that could easily be, uh, up to, you know, 8 stories without any impact on.

603
01:15:52,773 --> 01:15:56,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, you know, any existing residences.

604
01:15:57,976 --> 01:16:03,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and, uh, you know, I've heard a lot of concern about shadows and I think.

605
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:06,262
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, you know, the step backs, uh, the 45 degree.

606
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:09,558
[SPEAKER_07]: step back from residential makes sense.

607
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:25,549
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's something that we've seen before, but the idea that, um, there's a harm that at a certain time of year and for a few hours in a day, there will be a shadow on a sidewalk or on the front of a building that that's a harm I disagree with, uh, completely.

608
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:31,873
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it's actually when you're in this area in the summer and it's hot, it would be nice to have a shadow.

609
01:16:32,534 --> 01:16:33,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and so,

610
01:16:34,303 --> 01:16:41,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there should be less concern about shadow cast on a commercial building.

611
01:16:42,488 --> 01:16:48,872
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not a realistic concern, especially when some of these buildings are already four stories tall.

612
01:16:49,293 --> 01:17:00,439
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to be adding density, not afraid of something that might happen for a few months that is actually not a bad thing.

613
01:17:02,454 --> 01:17:05,436
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the last point on the West side of this map.

614
01:17:06,196 --> 01:17:11,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the buildings, uh, on the West end of the map are six stories on the North side.

615
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:16,343
[SPEAKER_07]: There are already seven stories on the, um, on the winter street side.

616
01:17:16,943 --> 01:17:23,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and they go up to eight stories currently, uh, on the very far West end of the map on the mystic Valley parkway side.

617
01:17:24,387 --> 01:17:28,470
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't feel like this proposal is adding much, uh,

618
01:17:29,855 --> 01:17:32,297
[SPEAKER_07]: on the west side of the square for development.

619
01:17:32,357 --> 01:17:38,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Now maybe some other, at least in terms of height, I don't think there should be any concern about the height.

620
01:17:38,081 --> 01:17:40,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And if anything, you know, it seems conservative to me.

621
01:17:42,304 --> 01:17:58,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to point out a lot of the single family homes around there are walking distance to the square and could really, could benefit the square by giving homeowners more options with what to do with their property.

622
01:17:59,527 --> 01:18:06,230
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, like urban residential, you know, to allow several units of housing along high street on the north side.

623
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:11,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and along Windsor street on the, on the west side.

624
01:18:11,493 --> 01:18:24,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I think that that would, um, you know, if, if we're talking about large scale commercial development and we don't want empty storefronts, we do need residents, uh, who are able to support those businesses nearby.

625
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:25,120
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

626
01:18:25,977 --> 01:18:27,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, really all around the edges of the map.

627
01:18:28,018 --> 01:18:32,639
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's more opportunity to add urban residential as we step down into the neighborhood.

628
01:18:33,419 --> 01:18:37,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and again, we're giving property owners more options what to do with their property.

629
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:39,000
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not requiring anybody to.

630
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:43,741
[SPEAKER_07]: To, um, you know, tear down any buildings or stop the single family use.

631
01:18:44,542 --> 01:18:48,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and, uh, yeah, I'm in.

632
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:50,243
[SPEAKER_07]: North side of the map.

633
01:18:50,741 --> 01:19:01,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Over the highway north of where this map stretches, there's already large apartment buildings there, and so I think there's an opportunity to add more housing on that.

634
01:19:01,804 --> 01:19:05,686
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's the northeast side of this map where there's already large apartment buildings.

635
01:19:07,646 --> 01:19:14,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Along the highway, there's a desire for more heights where the hotel's already 12 stories on the south side, but on the north side, I think we could also add a lot.

636
01:19:16,129 --> 01:19:17,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm excited to see where this goes.

637
01:19:17,869 --> 01:19:20,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that we'll continue to

638
01:19:21,044 --> 01:19:21,864
[SPEAKER_07]: see the plan developed.

639
01:19:22,064 --> 01:19:22,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

640
01:19:23,605 --> 01:19:23,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

641
01:19:24,466 --> 01:19:24,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dave.

642
01:19:26,166 --> 01:19:28,327
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go next to Gaston.

643
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:30,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record, please.

644
01:19:30,688 --> 01:19:31,429
[SPEAKER_10]: And three minutes.

645
01:19:33,389 --> 01:19:34,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

646
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:36,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Gaston Fury 61, Stingley Road.

647
01:19:36,431 --> 01:19:38,592
[SPEAKER_06]: So first, I wanted to clarify what Dave said.

648
01:19:38,612 --> 01:19:41,873
[SPEAKER_06]: So urban residential actually does ban single-family housing.

649
01:19:42,633 --> 01:19:46,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that we don't have any right now in the north boundary of this.

650
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:48,496
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a neighborhood residential.

651
01:19:48,876 --> 01:19:50,797
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we were to step it up,

652
01:19:51,221 --> 01:19:55,362
[SPEAKER_06]: their own residential, it would actually not have single family housing by right.

653
01:19:56,862 --> 01:19:57,982
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just got a comment.

654
01:19:58,723 --> 01:20:01,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Councillor Callaghan referred to this.

655
01:20:01,203 --> 01:20:11,005
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the slides that have the cuts S5 and S6, there's no shadow that goes on the buildings basically to the north.

656
01:20:12,046 --> 01:20:18,767
[SPEAKER_06]: And those as currently said, I think it's a neighbourhood residential three to the north of the square.

657
01:20:19,388 --> 01:20:26,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just didn't know what the answer from Paula was related to the shallow analysis.

658
01:20:27,233 --> 01:20:39,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically on the buildings that would be on mixed use 2A that would limit or border on the north with the neighborhood residential three.

659
01:20:46,678 --> 01:20:59,382
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a slide that has a particular DS-5 cut, DS-6 as well, but I think DS-5 is more pronounced because I think you had a, let me see, a six-story building.

660
01:20:59,402 --> 01:21:02,043
[SPEAKER_06]: It's five.

661
01:21:03,203 --> 01:21:14,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, proposed section, so it has six stories to the north of Salem, and then to the north of that,

662
01:21:14,823 --> 01:21:16,605
[SPEAKER_06]: would be neighborhood residential three.

663
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:22,250
[SPEAKER_18]: If I may, Vice President Collins.

664
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:24,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, go ahead.

665
01:21:24,732 --> 01:21:28,755
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so it's not there because it was not studied.

666
01:21:29,356 --> 01:21:36,142
[SPEAKER_18]: We have other lots that are consecutive to this one that also makes use too.

667
01:21:36,202 --> 01:21:42,227
[SPEAKER_18]: So the section would need to be quite longer to address the transition between

668
01:21:42,818 --> 01:21:44,499
[SPEAKER_18]: these buildings and the neighborhood.

669
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:54,466
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it was asked twice, we can bring in the next one, a section that really shows this how it is.

670
01:21:55,586 --> 01:22:07,334
[SPEAKER_18]: But in the draft, in the Salem Street zoning, we already addressed this by having a transition between the residential and the mixed use or commercial.

671
01:22:07,974 --> 01:22:09,055
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that would apply

672
01:22:09,825 --> 01:22:11,726
[SPEAKER_18]: So that would apply also here.

673
01:22:12,126 --> 01:22:17,908
[SPEAKER_18]: So we wouldn't have the six stories just next to a residential.

674
01:22:18,368 --> 01:22:29,853
[SPEAKER_18]: There needs to be a gradient so that those heights will be in a 45-degree scaling kind of a. OK, perfect.

675
01:22:29,873 --> 01:22:31,234
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have the step backs?

676
01:22:32,574 --> 01:22:33,995
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, there will be step backs.

677
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:36,116
[SPEAKER_18]: So it doesn't, yeah.

678
01:22:37,693 --> 01:22:38,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect, thank you.

679
01:22:38,714 --> 01:22:39,794
[SPEAKER_06]: That addresses my question.

680
01:22:39,814 --> 01:22:40,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

681
01:22:41,055 --> 01:22:56,826
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the last comment that I had is that I understand that traffic is not part of the rezoning, but anyone that has gone to the square in the morning, or even sometimes I happen to drive to city council meetings at 7 p.m.

682
01:22:57,807 --> 01:23:04,711
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not that I'm stuck there for a prolonged period of time, but it's definitely bumper to bumper traffic, and it takes quite a while.

683
01:23:04,771 --> 01:23:06,172
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm coming from Governor's Town,

684
01:23:07,598 --> 01:23:13,220
[SPEAKER_06]: and then going to the city council, you know, it's, there is a concealed traffic at 7 p.m.

685
01:23:13,761 --> 01:23:25,226
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just wondering, you know, so this slide that was shown about the existing conditions, that it's a lot of commercial right now, and then cars parked along High Street, but no one lives there.

686
01:23:26,106 --> 01:23:35,670
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm concerned that, you know, by adding a lot of residential, which we definitely need, so I'm not saying that we should not have it, but I'm just,

687
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:43,098
[SPEAKER_06]: constraint at the disconnect between the amount of housing that we're going to have and how is the traffic going to flow.

688
01:23:44,258 --> 01:23:59,881
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I don't know what can be done about this, but I think it would be beneficial to at some point sort of consider them together and see what could be done in terms of traffic patterns to sort of account for the increasing traffic that we'll have in the future.

689
01:24:00,862 --> 01:24:01,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

690
01:24:01,642 --> 01:24:03,162
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate everyone's work.

691
01:24:03,202 --> 01:24:03,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

692
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:06,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for your comments, Gaston.

693
01:24:07,382 --> 01:24:08,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Well heard and well taken.

694
01:24:08,383 --> 01:24:17,048
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that we will absolutely be continuing to consider traffic parking and increasing density in tandem as we go forward this spring.

695
01:24:17,189 --> 01:24:18,730
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for your comments.

696
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:21,852
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go next to Navar.

697
01:24:22,512 --> 01:24:23,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record, please.

698
01:24:23,853 --> 01:24:25,934
[SPEAKER_10]: And you have three minutes.

699
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:32,499
[SPEAKER_00]: William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

700
01:24:34,838 --> 01:24:36,400
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to make a few points.

701
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:52,558
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess there's a big concern that small and narrow parcels are unable to support height, and that's probably true in some sense, but I wonder if that could change in the future based on changes to the

702
01:24:53,259 --> 01:24:59,388
[SPEAKER_00]: building code, which is outside of city council's jurisdiction, but could happen by somebody else making a decision.

703
01:24:59,408 --> 01:25:07,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, somebody coming up with different construction technology that makes it practical to build a building that might not be practical today.

704
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:08,120
[SPEAKER_00]: You know,

705
01:25:09,493 --> 01:25:17,499
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if our city council is OK with the height that would be allowed, even if it's not possible to build today.

706
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like a future proofing would be to allow it.

707
01:25:22,062 --> 01:25:36,372
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, we don't need to be constantly revisiting, oh, what's possible based on this amendment to the building code or that change to building practices, technology, and so on, materials.

708
01:25:37,175 --> 01:25:39,276
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know, stuff is very complicated.

709
01:25:39,336 --> 01:25:41,577
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be possible today, maybe it is in the future.

710
01:25:43,537 --> 01:25:47,298
[SPEAKER_00]: As for the shade, I kind of agree with what Dave said.

711
01:25:47,318 --> 01:25:57,082
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think, especially when we're talking about a commercial building, I don't share the concern about the shadows to the extent that others might.

712
01:25:58,683 --> 01:26:03,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Is direct sunlight necessarily always desirable beaming in a shop window?

713
01:26:03,225 --> 01:26:06,386
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Alamo Pizza faces north.

714
01:26:06,466 --> 01:26:07,887
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not getting direct sunlight.

715
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:09,628
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the way it is.

716
01:26:09,648 --> 01:26:15,230
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, should we assume it's a disaster if Modern Pastry no longer gets direct sunlight through its window?

717
01:26:17,290 --> 01:26:23,314
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible they selected that location because of the direct sunlight, but I don't, you know, do we know that to be true?

718
01:26:26,095 --> 01:26:37,863
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like an interesting assumption that south-facing businesses, ground floor retail and so on, it has to have direct sunlight in the window at maximum time.

719
01:26:39,644 --> 01:26:43,767
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically my overall question is just, will this give enough density?

720
01:26:44,388 --> 01:26:55,416
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just for the purpose of addressing a regional housing shortage, which is one concern, but also just to support the square as the commercial district we want.

721
01:26:58,038 --> 01:27:03,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we see that happening given this zoning, I wonder?

722
01:27:04,183 --> 01:27:06,305
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are my thoughts and questions, thank you.

723
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:09,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you very much, William.

724
01:27:11,877 --> 01:27:15,462
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I see no more hands raised from, oh, Councilor Callahan, please go ahead.

725
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:20,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

726
01:27:20,215 --> 01:27:21,816
[SPEAKER_14]: I just had a question.

727
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:36,682
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that when I looked at one of the Medford Square master plans, it talked about very, very specific types of businesses that we are lacking in the square.

728
01:27:37,782 --> 01:27:39,003
[SPEAKER_14]: And I should look it up.

729
01:27:39,903 --> 01:27:44,305
[SPEAKER_14]: and go back and recall more exactly which types of businesses those were.

730
01:27:44,365 --> 01:27:49,087
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think it was things like more restaurants and less insurance companies or something.

731
01:27:49,167 --> 01:28:01,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Not that I want to pick on insurance companies or anything, but more of the places where people go and walk in and less of places where people don't actually have to walk into that store on a daily basis.

732
01:28:03,753 --> 01:28:11,818
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I'm curious if that is something that we do with zoning, or if that is something like, is there a micro zoning that you do in a place like Medford squared?

733
01:28:11,858 --> 01:28:17,662
[SPEAKER_14]: It took to sort of try to incentivize the kinds of businesses that we want that are to be in the center of the square.

734
01:28:18,182 --> 01:28:25,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Or is that something that we rely upon our generally our planning department and our economic development director and those sorts of.

735
01:28:27,388 --> 01:28:37,498
[SPEAKER_14]: people if we want to change the percentage of those types of businesses that we have in the square to make it a more vibrant and walkable square.

736
01:28:40,050 --> 01:28:40,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Graham.

737
01:28:41,010 --> 01:28:43,551
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's, um, it's a really interesting prompt.

738
01:28:43,591 --> 01:28:56,014
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's one that, um, well, I just say that I think the concept of how do we, how do we get the type of stuff in the square that we feel like the community is really clamoring for is a question that is kind of frequently on people's minds.

739
01:28:57,214 --> 01:29:09,537
[SPEAKER_10]: My understanding, and I'll pass it over to city staff or economic development director after this, but I think that how, as folks know, um, how uses interplay with zoning is that we have this ability to say,

740
01:29:10,577 --> 01:29:16,219
[SPEAKER_10]: clearly defined uses that are allowed by right, that are allowed under certain circumstances, and that are never allowed.

741
01:29:16,759 --> 01:29:29,342
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's my understanding that it is both tricky and we also get into heavily constrained legal waters when we start saying, we start cherry picking, picking and choosing, and that would require

742
01:29:31,235 --> 01:29:36,478
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, perhaps I think there's always a long list of things in a commercial district.

743
01:29:36,798 --> 01:29:39,639
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a lot of different types of companies and offices that are going to be available by right.

744
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:45,242
[SPEAKER_10]: It's often a smaller list of those that are more regulated by special permit or explicitly not allowed.

745
01:29:45,983 --> 01:29:56,848
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it gets very complicated when we try to use zoning to get more specific about that, which is why I think this overlaps so heavily with the work of the economic development director and city planning staff.

746
01:29:58,709 --> 01:30:00,250
[SPEAKER_10]: But I will go to Director Hunt.

747
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:04,262
[SPEAKER_10]: and then our Director of Economic Development for more on this.

748
01:30:07,343 --> 01:30:08,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

749
01:30:08,444 --> 01:30:22,012
[SPEAKER_02]: To sort of briefly, just to be very clear, if a business applies and we deny it, that is very problematic if they're in allowed use.

750
01:30:22,072 --> 01:30:25,794
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't actually, or if somebody wants to rent somewhere in their allowed use, we can't say no.

751
01:30:26,456 --> 01:30:30,718
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the sticky things we run into is that people may say, well, we have too many banks.

752
01:30:31,378 --> 01:30:34,679
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is nobody wants no banks, right?

753
01:30:35,139 --> 01:30:39,541
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we allow banks, we can't say, oh, we already have three.

754
01:30:39,661 --> 01:30:44,323
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't say yes to more banks, or we can't say no to the rest of them, right?

755
01:30:44,383 --> 01:30:45,583
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your sticky thing.

756
01:30:45,863 --> 01:30:48,544
[SPEAKER_02]: If you say, well, we have three, let's say they're not allowed anymore.

757
01:30:49,245 --> 01:30:50,965
[SPEAKER_02]: But then what if those three close, right?

758
01:30:51,005 --> 01:30:53,226
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to sort of be careful with that.

759
01:30:53,546 --> 01:30:55,367
[SPEAKER_02]: You could literally say no banks.

760
01:30:56,052 --> 01:31:01,015
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not necessarily going to be good for the residents either.

761
01:31:01,115 --> 01:31:05,618
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are places that say no medical, and they have a medical, like a lack of medical.

762
01:31:05,638 --> 01:31:07,399
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are neighborhoods that have no banks.

763
01:31:07,499 --> 01:31:10,000
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that is a problem too, right?

764
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:12,102
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are a banking desert, they have those.

765
01:31:13,202 --> 01:31:16,544
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of have to be careful about that with zoning.

766
01:31:18,617 --> 01:31:20,478
[SPEAKER_02]: we have to be really thoughtful about it.

767
01:31:21,458 --> 01:31:23,879
[SPEAKER_02]: But then what we can do is recruitment.

768
01:31:24,519 --> 01:31:28,241
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes we do try to help with some matchmaking and stuff.

769
01:31:28,981 --> 01:31:43,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that if I'll let economic development director, Sal DiStefano speak to that, because that is something that our economic development staff do do is trying to convince businesses that we'd like to see come here.

770
01:31:43,947 --> 01:31:47,148
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll let Sal say a few words.

771
01:31:47,677 --> 01:31:48,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, go ahead, sell.

772
01:31:48,597 --> 01:31:49,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we'll go to you, Councilor Scarpelli.

773
01:31:53,219 --> 01:31:54,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

774
01:31:54,679 --> 01:32:00,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I definitely want to echo what Director Hunt mentioned.

775
01:32:01,222 --> 01:32:07,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but, you know, just as an aside, we have launched vacant storefront

776
01:32:08,065 --> 01:32:21,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Program to encourage the occupancy of vacant storefronts through a matching grant through our CDBG program and the state that could be up to 20000 dollars, a 10000 from our CDBG.

777
01:32:25,866 --> 01:32:27,907
[SPEAKER_11]: and $10,000 from refundable tax credits.

778
01:32:29,088 --> 01:32:32,469
[SPEAKER_11]: We have reapplied to boost that fund.

779
01:32:34,229 --> 01:32:38,471
[SPEAKER_11]: We are also on the verge of launching a retail pop-up program.

780
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:49,470
[SPEAKER_11]: to promote different types of retail to be in the district that are locally owned.

781
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:55,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually these are entrepreneurs that maybe have an online presence, but they want to try their hand at retail.

782
01:32:56,599 --> 01:33:03,165
[SPEAKER_11]: We are working on that through another grant through our CDBG funding.

783
01:33:05,227 --> 01:33:07,009
[SPEAKER_11]: And Director Hunt is correct.

784
01:33:07,069 --> 01:33:15,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Whenever we do find a vacant storefront, we are working on getting different uses there.

785
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so we try to do it in a proactive way.

786
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:26,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of restricting property owner rights as to who they can or cannot lease to.

787
01:33:26,763 --> 01:33:33,224
[SPEAKER_11]: But with that being said, there are other communities that have put things in place, like a main streets program.

788
01:33:34,044 --> 01:33:37,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Or a business improvement district.

789
01:33:38,345 --> 01:33:42,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Where, um, in the form of a public private partnership.

790
01:33:44,809 --> 01:33:49,508
[SPEAKER_11]: It's usually merchant owners and property owners that band together.

791
01:33:52,094 --> 01:33:54,435
[SPEAKER_11]: of the city and they work together.

792
01:33:54,736 --> 01:34:14,146
[SPEAKER_11]: And if that group really petitions for that a certain area restrict first floor office use that has been done in other communities, but it takes a lot of leadership from existing property owners and businesses to enact that.

793
01:34:14,866 --> 01:34:19,449
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's definitely a process and it could be something that

794
01:34:20,009 --> 01:34:22,371
[SPEAKER_11]: potentially could be beneficial to Medford.

795
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:28,615
[SPEAKER_11]: The only challenge is that our business districts are spread out compared to other communities.

796
01:34:29,055 --> 01:34:37,601
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, in Gloucester, most of the businesses are on a main street downtown near City Hall, whereas we're more spread out.

797
01:34:37,701 --> 01:34:41,964
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's tough to do one district and achieve economies of scale.

798
01:34:42,044 --> 01:34:43,385
[SPEAKER_11]: However, with that being said,

799
01:34:44,114 --> 01:34:48,897
[SPEAKER_11]: We're always working with businesses, trying to get them into Medford.

800
01:34:49,398 --> 01:34:54,941
[SPEAKER_11]: We have some interesting prospects that we hope will move forward.

801
01:34:55,822 --> 01:35:04,768
[SPEAKER_11]: But with that being said, I definitely hear everybody about concerns about the business mix.

802
01:35:05,409 --> 01:35:12,614
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's something that we are always trying to work on and appreciate working with landlords and brokers.

803
01:35:13,537 --> 01:35:20,844
[SPEAKER_11]: others on any vacant space you have so we could try to do some of the matchmaking that Director Hunt was speaking of.

804
01:35:20,904 --> 01:35:21,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

805
01:35:22,245 --> 01:35:22,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.

806
01:35:22,725 --> 01:35:37,739
[SPEAKER_14]: That's actually incredibly helpful to hear what other communities do and that there is this possibility of, you know, like a economic district supported by a group of, you know, public and private, I suppose, might be a good

807
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:39,420
[SPEAKER_14]: name for it.

808
01:35:40,001 --> 01:35:40,941
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great to know.

809
01:35:41,121 --> 01:35:51,608
[SPEAKER_14]: And thanks so much for elaborating on the usefulness of zoning in this particular thing and how we actually do it, which is not through zoning, but really through our staff and our administration.

810
01:35:51,748 --> 01:35:52,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.

811
01:35:52,248 --> 01:35:55,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the question, Councillor Callahan.

812
01:35:55,910 --> 01:35:58,872
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you, Sal, for the very informative response.

813
01:35:59,592 --> 01:36:00,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Councillor Scarpelli, please go ahead.

814
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:02,881
[SPEAKER_01]: No, thank you council vice president.

815
01:36:03,061 --> 01:36:14,865
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate everybody's work and I think this is such a vital, vital piece of where the direction of method is going when you talk about method square.

816
01:36:15,645 --> 01:36:21,387
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that we've all been waiting for when it talks about zoning and redevelopment and I know.

817
01:36:22,467 --> 01:36:24,868
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would caution our group to maybe.

818
01:36:25,648 --> 01:36:29,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe really take a step back and I know we've done comprehensive plans.

819
01:36:29,050 --> 01:36:29,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we've done.

820
01:36:30,450 --> 01:36:39,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, uh, we've looked back to other other plans that were put together in a place, but I think it's very important that we possibly should be looking at.

821
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:40,302
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard so many amazing.

822
01:36:40,802 --> 01:36:49,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing things from different professionals tonight that when you look at what we're trying to do in method square and zoning being the piece, but I think that.

823
01:36:50,173 --> 01:36:56,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Where, where we're handcuffed and what we can do when you talk about development, I think it's important that we maybe.

824
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:04,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Start working a little bit closer, especially with this quarter and looking at this area and looking at what we're trying to do zoning.

825
01:37:05,647 --> 01:37:08,428
[SPEAKER_01]: and development and working with the state.

826
01:37:10,608 --> 01:37:27,113
[SPEAKER_01]: I was very fortunate to work with one of the most innovative mayors in the Commonwealth, Joe Curtatone, when he redeveloped Assembly Row, and looking at the gateway communities and understanding how we brought that together.

827
01:37:27,133 --> 01:37:35,075
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me the opportunity to sit on so many amazing meetings and watched how he grew certain parts of that community.

828
01:37:35,635 --> 01:37:50,448
[SPEAKER_01]: And something simple as lower Broadway where he eliminated two lanes on each side and made it one lane and took me down for a ride because my uncle was upset that traffic was building up on low Broadway and understanding.

829
01:37:51,209 --> 01:38:03,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Slowing that roadway down increased the visibility for the storefronts and expanding sidewalks and bringing neighbors and businesses out together and bringing the community out.

830
01:38:04,086 --> 01:38:05,708
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so important to watch that.

831
01:38:06,408 --> 01:38:09,292
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would often call me and he would say,

832
01:38:10,205 --> 01:38:11,826
[SPEAKER_01]: George, guess where I am?

833
01:38:12,066 --> 01:38:20,169
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would laugh because he would say, what community would build an access road around the center of your town to avoid the center of your town?

834
01:38:20,209 --> 01:38:22,590
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have that.

835
01:38:23,251 --> 01:38:29,693
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have so many aspects of Meffitt Square where we're looking at the Mystic River.

836
01:38:29,733 --> 01:38:35,716
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at possibly the opportunity that we saw when we closed an exit, an off-ramp.

837
01:38:36,356 --> 01:38:46,002
[SPEAKER_01]: and saw what that made, what kind of an impact that would make to our walkable, bikeable, and community-driven development in that area.

838
01:38:46,402 --> 01:38:56,249
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the excitement, and I appreciate all the work we're doing with the zoning and looking at the different benefits we have, but maybe this is a time that we can

839
01:38:56,969 --> 01:39:00,934
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, take a deep breath and slow this process down so we can bring together.

840
01:39:01,635 --> 01:39:12,208
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our stakeholders, our business communities, I, I understand that the hand how we handcuffed with the mandates of, you know, we don't allow banks.

841
01:39:12,228 --> 01:39:13,009
[SPEAKER_01]: We need banks.

842
01:39:13,149 --> 01:39:13,850
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.

843
01:39:14,371 --> 01:39:14,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but.

844
01:39:15,552 --> 01:39:16,892
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about parking.

845
01:39:16,933 --> 01:39:35,479
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked to so many residents and business owners that have talked about revisiting the parking garage behind Colleen's and looking at the other side of the city and providing another anchor parking area where you're making Meffitt Square more vibrant.

846
01:39:35,819 --> 01:39:40,941
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be interesting to see if there's possibility of working with the Riverside Mall and

847
01:39:41,421 --> 01:39:48,403
[SPEAKER_01]: redeveloping that area together with the three parcels that we put out to bid with our zoning changes.

848
01:39:48,483 --> 01:39:54,044
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure that our team has been doing that, but I don't think that it's been public enough.

849
01:39:54,144 --> 01:40:06,508
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that our community has shared the vision that when we talk about two ways, a two-way lane on Salem Street, or changing the traffic flow, or understanding the traffic studies with the state,

850
01:40:07,088 --> 01:40:34,578
[SPEAKER_01]: so i think we're at a critical time but exciting time that as we're looking at our zoning we should be really stepping back and looking what neighboring communities have done and growing certain areas of their community and and use it as a model it doesn't have to be assembly row it doesn't have to be linfield it doesn't have to be malden center but we can

851
01:40:36,058 --> 01:40:43,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at what we're doing with our zoning and the opportunities we have for redeveloping that area with the business community housing.

852
01:40:44,125 --> 01:40:46,467
[SPEAKER_01]: And mix use that I think is very exciting.

853
01:40:46,527 --> 01:40:50,670
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that that that's what I'm hearing from this meeting.

854
01:40:50,770 --> 01:40:52,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Although we heard a lot of great.

855
01:40:54,573 --> 01:40:58,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Understanding of what the zoning is in these these quarters, but at the same time.

856
01:40:59,546 --> 01:41:01,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Really looking at the bigger piece.

857
01:41:01,688 --> 01:41:04,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the what I'm hearing from residents that.

858
01:41:04,930 --> 01:41:10,534
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we doing with method square and as we're doing this zoning, it shouldn't be 3 prong traffic study.

859
01:41:11,174 --> 01:41:20,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Development zoning, I think that, you know, it'd be a, it'd be a great way to capture a way that we can bring it all together, bring in housing.

860
01:41:21,521 --> 01:41:25,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And bring in bringing it all together for for this area because I.

861
01:41:27,125 --> 01:41:33,489
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I don't see it as a comprehensive plan with all the entities together.

862
01:41:33,529 --> 01:41:35,931
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it as bits and pieces.

863
01:41:36,211 --> 01:41:46,437
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it might be beneficial that we use that community-based meeting that we're trying to implement in a better fashion.

864
01:41:46,457 --> 01:41:47,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate what you're doing.

865
01:41:48,018 --> 01:41:51,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Council Vice President with that and getting the community more involved.

866
01:41:51,601 --> 01:41:53,763
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that this is vital.

867
01:41:53,863 --> 01:41:58,126
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I know I'm a little winded, but I think this is a huge opportunity for us.

868
01:41:58,166 --> 01:41:59,728
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for allowing me to speak.

869
01:41:59,788 --> 01:42:00,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

870
01:42:01,201 --> 01:42:02,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, Councillor, thank you so much.

871
01:42:02,542 --> 01:42:04,724
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate you putting that all out there.

872
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:06,265
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think your points are really well taken.

873
01:42:06,285 --> 01:42:08,807
[SPEAKER_10]: I hear you.

874
01:42:08,827 --> 01:42:20,217
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that Medford Square is probably our best example of all of the areas that we're going to look at in the comprehensive rezoning of like just all of these themes interacting with each other.

875
01:42:20,237 --> 01:42:22,499
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think people really feel that.

876
01:42:22,539 --> 01:42:23,280
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that

877
01:42:24,871 --> 01:42:46,288
[SPEAKER_10]: know this is our chance to use the structure of the zoning overhaul to continue to try to use this as a container for bringing together residents and butters and members of our business community and the great minds inside city hall together with our zoning consultant to look down at the plans that we already have the people already waited on

878
01:42:46,748 --> 01:43:04,689
[SPEAKER_10]: And continue widening that net and making sure that with every meeting, with all the meetings that we're going to have in this committee on this proposal, and then in the Q and A that we'll have on the squares, and then with the public hearings that the CDB will have, totally every step of the way, we have to be widening that net and making sure that more voices are included.

879
01:43:04,729 --> 01:43:05,690
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also think that it's,

880
01:43:07,597 --> 01:43:27,729
[SPEAKER_10]: These, these committee meetings in a way to me are kind of like a think of it as like a tip of the iceberg where so many things get concepts get mentioned and plans that have like hours and hours of work and collaboration behind them and these meetings can sometimes feel like a really brief snapshot of all this work that's gone on.

881
01:43:28,930 --> 01:43:32,292
[SPEAKER_10]: to become the plans and the themes that just get mentioned in passing here.

882
01:43:33,513 --> 01:43:43,419
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that, I hope that when residents interact with that, they can see that and take it as an on-ramp for continuing to attend these meetings and learn more about the things that get mentioned.

883
01:43:43,459 --> 01:43:44,580
[SPEAKER_10]: But thank you so much.

884
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:45,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

885
01:43:46,001 --> 01:43:46,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Really appreciate it.

886
01:43:47,102 --> 01:43:49,463
[SPEAKER_10]: And I saw your hand up.

887
01:43:49,483 --> 01:43:55,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to comment or do you want to wait until we have one more bit of public participation on this topic?

888
01:43:55,487 --> 01:43:57,248
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we can, if you want to.

889
01:43:57,988 --> 01:43:59,710
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I can wait for the next one.

890
01:43:59,750 --> 01:44:00,030
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

891
01:44:00,751 --> 01:44:01,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, great.

892
01:44:01,912 --> 01:44:02,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

893
01:44:02,212 --> 01:44:04,995
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we will get to our second topic of the evening, which is ADUs.

894
01:44:05,015 --> 01:44:06,436
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hope we've all been pacing ourselves.

895
01:44:06,916 --> 01:44:07,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

896
01:44:09,619 --> 01:44:11,561
[SPEAKER_10]: So I see one more hand raised for public participation.

897
01:44:11,921 --> 01:44:12,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Cheryl, go ahead.

898
01:44:12,642 --> 01:44:13,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record, please.

899
01:44:13,903 --> 01:44:14,504
[SPEAKER_10]: You have three minutes.

900
01:44:18,127 --> 01:44:19,929
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

901
01:44:20,409 --> 01:44:23,512
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm concerned that this zoning is not allowing much room for growth.

902
01:44:24,108 --> 01:44:30,711
[SPEAKER_17]: And in many spaces, it's not much different from the current zoning or current on the ground with the exception of a lot from the RFP.

903
01:44:31,432 --> 01:44:47,380
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate that the shadow studies and feasibility studies are being done now before the zoning is written and passed to the community development board after how the studies were not a factor in the final vote for Salem Street because they were started too late to be a part of the conversation of writing the zoning.

904
01:44:48,081 --> 01:44:52,723
[SPEAKER_17]: This consideration for the neighbors is nothing more than what Salem Street asked for and did not receive.

905
01:44:53,369 --> 01:45:02,013
[SPEAKER_17]: It is disappointing to see large portions of the square being less or equal to Salem Street with future zoning without us having the support of a major square.

906
01:45:02,033 --> 01:45:09,857
[SPEAKER_17]: I recommend that the community meeting happen for this project before the zoning is passed to the Community Development Board.

907
01:45:10,617 --> 01:45:22,323
[SPEAKER_17]: And the idea of closing the ramp, which we know when they did it temporarily, will force more traffic to the Salem Street area, which I hope would be studied before that is even suggested as it will too have

908
01:45:23,267 --> 01:45:25,928
[SPEAKER_17]: very strong impact on the Salem Street area.

909
01:45:26,148 --> 01:45:26,568
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

910
01:45:28,609 --> 01:45:29,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for coming, Cheryl.

911
01:45:30,790 --> 01:45:36,711
[SPEAKER_10]: I do just want to state for clarity for any folks who are watching, the ramp issue, I'm glad folks are talking about that.

912
01:45:36,751 --> 01:45:39,572
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not something that we could do through zoning, so I just want to make that clear.

913
01:45:39,592 --> 01:45:44,754
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the speaker, I know that's not something that they were putting forward, but I just want to state that for clarity.

914
01:45:45,334 --> 01:45:47,335
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not a change that we'll be making through this process.

915
01:45:50,074 --> 01:45:54,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing no public participation, thank you all so much for weighing in.

916
01:45:54,257 --> 01:46:01,503
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is, I just want to state again, I'll state at the beginning, I'll state at the end, this is our first draft of the zoning proposal for Medford Square.

917
01:46:01,523 --> 01:46:02,884
[SPEAKER_10]: This will be an iterative process.

918
01:46:02,924 --> 01:46:04,665
[SPEAKER_10]: We will see this again in this committee.

919
01:46:05,926 --> 01:46:12,912
[SPEAKER_10]: And if community members have additional feedback or ideas that they want to share in between or outside of committee meetings,

920
01:46:13,852 --> 01:46:15,033
[SPEAKER_10]: they can email those to me.

921
01:46:15,093 --> 01:46:19,474
[SPEAKER_10]: I will get them circulated to our zoning consultant and our planning staff.

922
01:46:20,395 --> 01:46:27,117
[SPEAKER_10]: So Paola, please feel free to respond and then we can go ahead to our overview of the latest updates to the ADU's ordinance.

923
01:46:27,137 --> 01:46:27,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

924
01:46:27,777 --> 01:46:31,759
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

925
01:46:33,299 --> 01:46:36,820
[SPEAKER_18]: So about the shadows that we were doing and studying,

926
01:46:39,269 --> 01:46:48,252
[SPEAKER_18]: In these areas, we allow six stories by right or four stories by right, plus the two incentive zoning.

927
01:46:48,892 --> 01:46:50,433
[SPEAKER_18]: So up to six, up to eight.

928
01:46:51,533 --> 01:47:00,776
[SPEAKER_18]: In the sections, what you see is more of a big step back so that it doesn't provide cast shadows on the entire of the street.

929
01:47:02,156 --> 01:47:07,818
[SPEAKER_18]: The best thing that we could have on the street is one side that is in shadow, one side that is on the sun.

930
01:47:08,552 --> 01:47:13,536
[SPEAKER_18]: direct sunlight, so it's more comfortable for any time of the year.

931
01:47:13,556 --> 01:47:17,118
[SPEAKER_18]: It is important to do shadow studies.

932
01:47:17,258 --> 01:47:21,862
[SPEAKER_18]: These are not the shadow studies that a development should do, a developer should do.

933
01:47:23,325 --> 01:47:33,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, in many cities, they are doing average of how many hours per day in a year, um, will affect the neighbors.

934
01:47:33,611 --> 01:47:38,695
[SPEAKER_18]: It's around established around two or three, depending on the city that you looked at.

935
01:47:39,615 --> 01:47:52,523
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, also it's important to think about the wind tunnel effect, having a variation about four, six, et cetera, in different areas, in different sides of the street will provide for not having a wind tunnel.

936
01:47:53,363 --> 01:48:03,692
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and then if it's more variable, the facade on the street will also make it more, um, statically pleasing and more attractive.

937
01:48:04,212 --> 01:48:07,415
[SPEAKER_18]: If we have that variable street facade and not all the same.

938
01:48:08,035 --> 01:48:11,398
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is, as I said in the beginning, these are just proposals.

939
01:48:11,478 --> 01:48:15,101
[SPEAKER_18]: Then further studies when a developer will want to do, um,

940
01:48:16,902 --> 01:48:20,366
[SPEAKER_18]: a development, a project, they will have to do a lot of other studies.

941
01:48:20,706 --> 01:48:22,028
[SPEAKER_18]: These are only proposals.

942
01:48:23,149 --> 01:48:28,474
[SPEAKER_18]: And the studies of shadow, et cetera, and traffic, and et cetera, would be a lot in depth.

943
01:48:29,335 --> 01:48:33,199
[SPEAKER_18]: And yeah, I just wanted to clarify that.

944
01:48:33,219 --> 01:48:34,020
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

945
01:48:37,304 --> 01:48:37,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

946
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:39,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the clarification, Paola.

947
01:48:41,093 --> 01:48:52,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's proceed along to the overview of the latest updates to the ADU's ordinance, unless there's anything more on this, but I think we have a lot to respond to for the next draft of this proposal.

948
01:48:57,347 --> 01:48:59,830
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I will start sharing the presentation.

949
01:49:06,025 --> 01:49:13,770
[SPEAKER_10]: And while you're getting set up, Paola, I'll just state I wanted to give you a brief vocal rest since you've been presenting a lot tonight.

950
01:49:13,951 --> 01:49:31,563
[SPEAKER_10]: And while you're getting the PowerPoint up, I said this at the beginning of the meeting, but for anybody who's joined after our initial five minutes, at our previous committee meeting on the 12th, we got an overview of potential changes to make to our existing accessory dwelling unit ordinance.

951
01:49:32,083 --> 01:49:34,165
[SPEAKER_10]: We already have a regulation around ADUs.

952
01:49:34,625 --> 01:49:37,888
[SPEAKER_10]: We are considering kind of two buckets of updates and changes to that.

953
01:49:38,408 --> 01:49:51,078
[SPEAKER_10]: One are changes that the city is compelled to make because the state passed a new law and it is now required that wherever single family homes are allowable by right, ADUs must also be allowable by right.

954
01:49:51,098 --> 01:49:55,262
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have to make some changes to the ordinance to be in compliance with that state law.

955
01:49:55,762 --> 01:50:00,166
[SPEAKER_10]: And beyond that, there are additional decisions that we could make per our local jurisdiction.

956
01:50:00,726 --> 01:50:10,914
[SPEAKER_10]: We kind of got a initial conversation on all of those areas and questions two weeks ago, and councilors and community members got some ideas and thoughts out on the record.

957
01:50:10,934 --> 01:50:20,042
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we're going to revisit some of those questions tonight and kind of develop a path forward on some of those on some of the questions before us in terms of local ideas.

958
01:50:24,909 --> 01:50:25,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.

959
01:50:25,229 --> 01:50:25,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

960
01:50:25,649 --> 01:50:27,090
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

961
01:50:27,490 --> 01:50:36,133
[SPEAKER_18]: So as we said last time, there is this new law, state law, that is about the protected use accessory dwelling unit.

962
01:50:37,353 --> 01:50:43,955
[SPEAKER_18]: There are certain prohibited regulations that a municipality cannot have in their bylaws.

963
01:50:45,556 --> 01:50:54,619
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we are looking into all of these things, the dimensional standards that they request, for example, the non-conforming structures

964
01:50:55,143 --> 01:50:56,584
[SPEAKER_18]: special permits, et cetera.

965
01:50:57,445 --> 01:51:07,653
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are looking at this conditions and developing a new ADU by law.

966
01:51:11,376 --> 01:51:16,700
[SPEAKER_18]: There are some decisions that are left for the municipalities

967
01:51:18,362 --> 01:51:28,246
[SPEAKER_18]: whether to allow more accessory dwelling units in different districts and not only for the residential single family districts that they allow.

968
01:51:28,266 --> 01:51:36,309
[SPEAKER_18]: The municipalities can allow bigger ADUs than that 900 square foot restriction.

969
01:51:37,089 --> 01:51:40,090
[SPEAKER_18]: They can also allow additional ADUs on the same lot

970
01:51:40,580 --> 01:51:44,022
[SPEAKER_18]: but any additional has to be with special permit.

971
01:51:44,343 --> 01:51:50,247
[SPEAKER_18]: So you will have that protected ADU and then that new one that can be the local ADU.

972
01:51:51,868 --> 01:51:55,711
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the short-term rentals that is also for municipalities to establish.

973
01:51:57,355 --> 01:52:00,636
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so what we and I can show the draft later.

974
01:52:00,676 --> 01:52:07,839
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to do like a, um, a quick recap of what we have doing of what we have done for the.

975
01:52:07,859 --> 01:52:13,742
[SPEAKER_18]: A draft of the accessory drilling unit, um, we will amend the section of definitions.

976
01:52:14,282 --> 01:52:17,503
[SPEAKER_18]: There are the amendment for accessory drawing unit.

977
01:52:17,643 --> 01:52:19,704
[SPEAKER_18]: Now is the definition that is more complete.

978
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:25,747
[SPEAKER_18]: And also we can look at the short term rental if it needs, um, additional, um.

979
01:52:26,747 --> 01:52:33,232
[SPEAKER_18]: to bring the short-term rental definition that the state law is proposing.

980
01:52:33,872 --> 01:52:45,641
[SPEAKER_18]: Then we will add new definitions, and that is the local ADU, modular dwelling unit, protected use ADU, single unit dwelling residential zoning district, and transit station.

981
01:52:47,022 --> 01:52:50,845
[SPEAKER_18]: All of these need to be incorporated as new definitions.

982
01:52:52,897 --> 01:52:57,020
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we go to the accessory dwelling unit ordinance.

983
01:52:57,641 --> 01:53:01,744
[SPEAKER_18]: And that is, we will have purpose, then second, the regulations.

984
01:53:02,305 --> 01:53:05,568
[SPEAKER_18]: These regulations are going to be for general provision.

985
01:53:05,668 --> 01:53:18,939
[SPEAKER_18]: So for any ADU, it doesn't matter whether it's protector or local, and it will establish a gross floor area, design standards, and then about these short-term rentals, whether it's allowed or not allowed.

986
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:25,002
[SPEAKER_18]: Protected use ADU, the dimensionless standards, and then the off-street parking.

987
01:53:25,963 --> 01:53:30,225
[SPEAKER_18]: Local ADUs, the same dimensionless standards, and off-street parking.

988
01:53:30,345 --> 01:53:32,486
[SPEAKER_18]: This would be local ADUs by right.

989
01:53:33,086 --> 01:53:36,448
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we have a special permit for local ADUs.

990
01:53:37,128 --> 01:53:40,570
[SPEAKER_18]: And we will also have those dimensionless standards and off-street parking.

991
01:53:42,070 --> 01:53:47,313
[SPEAKER_18]: Then a fifth regulation would be the special permit for multiple ADUs on a lot.

992
01:53:48,006 --> 01:53:50,007
[SPEAKER_18]: and then the non-conformance.

993
01:53:51,067 --> 01:53:54,729
[SPEAKER_18]: At the end it will come the administration and enforcement.

994
01:53:55,930 --> 01:54:00,892
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to now share the draft.

995
01:54:02,333 --> 01:54:09,256
[SPEAKER_18]: But I just wanted to give the structure of the... Okay.

996
01:54:31,435 --> 01:54:32,556
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so.

997
01:54:33,896 --> 01:54:46,582
[SPEAKER_18]: As we see in the beginning, um, what we did is, um, we use the model of the zoning for accessory dwelling units that the state, uh, that is prepared by the metropolitan area planning council.

998
01:54:47,422 --> 01:54:50,664
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and what we do is use that as a base.

999
01:54:51,124 --> 01:54:57,987
[SPEAKER_18]: The yellow text will be modifications, uh, and our recommendations and the big pink highlighted text is.

1000
01:54:58,870 --> 01:55:02,574
[SPEAKER_18]: in the current zoning, in Medford current zoning.

1001
01:55:03,174 --> 01:55:13,304
[SPEAKER_18]: So here we have the definitions, the accessory dwelling unit, and then without the highlighted text is the proposed definition.

1002
01:55:14,205 --> 01:55:16,707
[SPEAKER_18]: Local ADUs, modular dwelling unit, protected ADUs.

1003
01:55:17,842 --> 01:55:18,883
[SPEAKER_18]: short term rentals.

1004
01:55:19,364 --> 01:55:23,369
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the existing that we have, and this would be the new one.

1005
01:55:25,072 --> 01:55:33,303
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's something that we would need to discuss with building commissioner and city staff, if this is something that we want to do.

1006
01:55:34,139 --> 01:55:36,280
[SPEAKER_18]: and single unit dwelling residential zoning district.

1007
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,140
[SPEAKER_18]: This is new one.

1008
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:43,001
[SPEAKER_18]: High frequency transit is already in your definition.

1009
01:55:44,021 --> 01:55:49,863
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are going to, that is going to keep as it is, but we are adding the transit station definition.

1010
01:55:52,323 --> 01:55:57,445
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we will go to the accessory dwelling units itself, the section itself.

1011
01:55:58,585 --> 01:56:03,286
[SPEAKER_18]: We have the purpose, the regulations,

1012
01:56:03,863 --> 01:56:15,827
[SPEAKER_18]: And so in here, we are looking at the general provisions for all ADUs, as we said, and then we have certain regulations, code compliance, gross floor area.

1013
01:56:17,588 --> 01:56:23,270
[SPEAKER_18]: So these are added to the general definition.

1014
01:56:23,290 --> 01:56:26,932
[SPEAKER_18]: This is something that would apply only to the ADUs.

1015
01:56:29,052 --> 01:56:30,513
[SPEAKER_18]: Then design standards.

1016
01:56:31,180 --> 01:56:32,340
[SPEAKER_18]: and short-term rentals.

1017
01:56:32,740 --> 01:56:38,962
[SPEAKER_18]: So in short-term rentals, what we did is bring what was already in your previous ADU section.

1018
01:56:39,702 --> 01:56:49,124
[SPEAKER_18]: And basically it says where the accessory dwelling unit or the principal dwelling is occupied as a rental unit, the minimum occupancy or rental term shall be 30 days.

1019
01:56:49,745 --> 01:56:55,586
[SPEAKER_18]: Therefore, in this case, we wouldn't be allowing short-term rentals in the ADUs.

1020
01:56:56,819 --> 01:57:01,941
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, then protected 80 years we have dimensional standards.

1021
01:57:02,421 --> 01:57:09,184
[SPEAKER_18]: There was a question whether to have, um, bigger than 900 square foot feet.

1022
01:57:10,145 --> 01:57:10,485
[SPEAKER_18]: Units.

1023
01:57:11,205 --> 01:57:13,946
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, we should remember that these are not.

1024
01:57:14,827 --> 01:57:17,968
[SPEAKER_18]: Meant to be a dwelling unit, but more.

1025
01:57:18,989 --> 01:57:19,889
[SPEAKER_18]: In the sense of.

1026
01:57:20,725 --> 01:57:30,652
[SPEAKER_18]: Um bigger lots, but more for that, uh, one bedroom, two bedroom 900 square foot are perfect for it's a two bedroom apartment.

1027
01:57:31,332 --> 01:57:34,954
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so if we want to do it bigger, that's fine.

1028
01:57:34,994 --> 01:57:37,296
[SPEAKER_18]: We can do it for protected and local.

1029
01:57:37,836 --> 01:57:43,480
[SPEAKER_18]: It can also be that we do it for protected and not for the local, but just keep in mind that this is.

1030
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:46,001
[SPEAKER_18]: Perfectly feasible for an 80 year 900.

1031
01:57:47,570 --> 01:57:57,178
[SPEAKER_18]: The other question was if we could actually change the or half of the gross floor area of the principal dwelling, whichever is smaller.

1032
01:57:58,739 --> 01:58:12,770
[SPEAKER_18]: This half of the gross floor area, the only trick part is that an ADU can be external, so detached or attached or inside.

1033
01:58:12,790 --> 01:58:16,112
[SPEAKER_18]: So when it's the same building, the same

1034
01:58:17,743 --> 01:58:29,108
[SPEAKER_18]: principle unit, and you would divide that, if you do more than half, which one becomes the ADU and which one becomes the unit, it's a bit tricky.

1035
01:58:29,548 --> 01:58:32,949
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that's why they have this half of the gross floor area.

1036
01:58:33,109 --> 01:58:39,072
[SPEAKER_18]: In any case, we're still checking with our legal partners.

1037
01:58:40,222 --> 01:58:48,287
[SPEAKER_18]: to whether we can do that or not, or if we can say only one is internal ADU, then it has to be half.

1038
01:58:48,627 --> 01:58:53,489
[SPEAKER_18]: But if it's detached, then it can go up to 60% or 70%.

1039
01:58:54,110 --> 01:58:58,092
[SPEAKER_18]: That's something that we're still studying, if that's something that we're really interested in.

1040
01:59:01,094 --> 01:59:08,818
[SPEAKER_18]: For local ADUs, so we want to have by right to apply local ADUs in

1041
01:59:09,588 --> 01:59:15,390
[SPEAKER_18]: any of the other residential zoning districts that are not single family residential zoning districts.

1042
01:59:15,430 --> 01:59:23,833
[SPEAKER_18]: So in our case would be UR1 and UR2 if we go with this new districts.

1043
01:59:26,154 --> 01:59:31,216
[SPEAKER_18]: And only to be applied for a single unit dwelling, two unit dwelling and three unit dwelling.

1044
01:59:31,716 --> 01:59:34,977
[SPEAKER_18]: So for those three cases, we allow local ADUs.

1045
01:59:35,497 --> 01:59:38,098
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's a multiplex or multifamily,

1046
01:59:39,566 --> 01:59:44,349
[SPEAKER_18]: more than six units, we wouldn't be allowing the ADUs by right.

1047
01:59:48,371 --> 02:00:08,024
[SPEAKER_18]: And any other I can see special permit, this would be only if when there is already one ADU for that second ADU on the same lot, we would be talking about special permit for local ADUs.

1048
02:00:08,812 --> 02:00:11,734
[SPEAKER_18]: So that local ADU wouldn't be by right.

1049
02:00:12,274 --> 02:00:20,318
[SPEAKER_18]: And we could increase that gross floor area if we wanted to a 1,200 square foot.

1050
02:00:20,658 --> 02:00:22,399
[SPEAKER_18]: So it cannot be larger than that.

1051
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:26,281
[SPEAKER_18]: So we could give more flexibility with that.

1052
02:00:26,301 --> 02:00:36,447
[SPEAKER_18]: A special permit for multiple ADUs, this is basically

1053
02:00:37,857 --> 02:00:37,937
[SPEAKER_18]: Um.

1054
02:00:37,977 --> 02:00:48,281
[SPEAKER_18]: No more than two 80 years may be established on any residential lot was something that we're bringing from your, uh, previous or your existing and current 80 you section.

1055
02:00:49,541 --> 02:00:51,742
[SPEAKER_18]: And then administering an enforcement.

1056
02:00:52,623 --> 02:00:54,643
[SPEAKER_18]: Um we're also bringing part of it.

1057
02:01:05,211 --> 02:01:07,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Paola, for that overview.

1058
02:01:10,014 --> 02:01:10,814
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really helpful.

1059
02:01:10,834 --> 02:01:13,396
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate the way that you organized it.

1060
02:01:13,416 --> 02:01:15,457
[SPEAKER_10]: I see a hand on Zoom.

1061
02:01:15,497 --> 02:01:16,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

1062
02:01:16,057 --> 02:01:21,160
[SPEAKER_10]: We will take public participation on ADUs after questions and comments from counselors.

1063
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:21,661
[SPEAKER_10]: So sit tight.

1064
02:01:21,701 --> 02:01:22,481
[SPEAKER_10]: We will definitely get to you.

1065
02:01:25,937 --> 02:01:29,978
[SPEAKER_10]: begin with my own clarifying questions and then see if there are others from other counselors.

1066
02:01:32,159 --> 02:01:39,801
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll just repeat some of this to make sure that I am understanding the presentation correctly and hopefully for the benefit of other viewers as well.

1067
02:01:40,422 --> 02:01:43,142
[SPEAKER_10]: So kind of going down the line of these various questions before us.

1068
02:01:45,970 --> 02:01:49,372
[SPEAKER_10]: to the first question around local ADUs, municipal jurisdiction.

1069
02:01:49,392 --> 02:02:07,685
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like per our, it seems like you adopted the preference that it seemed like it was voiced for most counselors at our last committee meeting, that we do want to allow local ADUs in more residential sub-districts beyond just those where single family homes are allowed by right.

1070
02:02:08,225 --> 02:02:15,190
[SPEAKER_10]: So is this understanding correct that in this draft, yes, local ADUs are allowed in all sub-districts,

1071
02:02:16,550 --> 02:02:31,496
[SPEAKER_10]: by right, but they're not allowed by right on lots that have for those larger residential building types, such as townhouses, multiplexes, multifamily units, sorry, multifamily buildings greater than six units.

1072
02:02:32,556 --> 02:02:40,659
[SPEAKER_10]: On your single family homes, your two families, your three units, those can have a local ADU by right, regardless of the residential subdistrict.

1073
02:02:40,720 --> 02:02:41,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that, do I have that right?

1074
02:02:42,832 --> 02:02:43,453
[SPEAKER_18]: That's correct.

1075
02:02:43,553 --> 02:02:43,794
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1076
02:02:43,894 --> 02:02:44,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

1077
02:02:44,535 --> 02:02:47,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for verifying my rambling paraphrasing.

1078
02:02:50,801 --> 02:03:05,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to return quickly to the municipal jurisdiction, municipal decision topic of can we have a second ADU on a single lot by special permit, I just want to make sure that I'm clear on this.

1079
02:03:05,585 --> 02:03:13,587
[SPEAKER_10]: So the conditions that trigger a special permit process, it's not that every local ADU must be approved by special permit.

1080
02:03:13,747 --> 02:03:17,228
[SPEAKER_10]: It's that if a second ADU

1081
02:03:18,208 --> 02:03:21,250
[SPEAKER_10]: on a single lot has to go through the special permit process.

1082
02:03:21,730 --> 02:03:27,073
[SPEAKER_10]: And through that special permit process, they may go as high as 1,200 square feet.

1083
02:03:28,594 --> 02:03:29,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct?

1084
02:03:29,054 --> 02:03:30,275
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, that is correct.

1085
02:03:30,915 --> 02:03:34,917
[SPEAKER_18]: And this comes from the model that was provided.

1086
02:03:35,458 --> 02:03:39,720
[SPEAKER_18]: If we want to lower it to 900, that's something that we can do as well.

1087
02:03:41,777 --> 02:03:42,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1088
02:03:42,137 --> 02:03:49,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Personally, I am fine with having the maximum area be up to 1,200.

1089
02:03:50,223 --> 02:03:57,048
[SPEAKER_10]: In this case, where it is moderated by a special permit process, I don't think that I would want any local ADU to be able to go quite that high.

1090
02:03:57,068 --> 02:03:58,429
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that 900 is reasonable.

1091
02:03:58,969 --> 02:04:06,074
[SPEAKER_10]: But since this is kind of bordered by the special permit process, I'm kind of OK with it because it has that level of supervision over it.

1092
02:04:09,376 --> 02:04:27,260
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the last comment that I wanted to put out before my fellow councillors, like I was saying, I think that the 900 square foot number seems about right to me for local ADUs in general in this non-special permit scenario.

1093
02:04:28,020 --> 02:04:38,583
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand the concern about, you know, if we're going above 50% of the gross floor area, then like which unit is inferior to which, I can understand that could get a little murky.

1094
02:04:40,103 --> 02:04:47,887
[SPEAKER_10]: I do think that in cases when you have an attached or internal ADU that it could, there might be a situation there would be helpful to be able to go above that maximum.

1095
02:04:49,187 --> 02:05:04,713
[SPEAKER_10]: So pending what legal counsel, what Attorney Silverstein has to say about this, I think it might be helpful in cases of an internal or attached ADU to be able to go up to 60% just in cases where like that is what makes sense for how the building is structured internally.

1096
02:05:07,254 --> 02:05:08,635
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we keep that flexible pending,

1097
02:05:10,283 --> 02:05:13,265
[SPEAKER_10]: a comment from Attorney Silverstein, that would make sense to me.

1098
02:05:15,467 --> 02:05:19,010
[SPEAKER_10]: And all of the other changes from my perspective as one counselor sound good.

1099
02:05:19,590 --> 02:05:25,915
[SPEAKER_10]: I was not particularly in favor of us growing our base of ADUs just for them to be used as short-term rentals.

1100
02:05:25,935 --> 02:05:31,059
[SPEAKER_10]: We want them to be used as housing for people who need housing of the scope and the scale.

1101
02:05:31,139 --> 02:05:33,221
[SPEAKER_10]: So that looks great to me as well.

1102
02:05:36,573 --> 02:05:40,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any questions or comments from my fellow counselors?

1103
02:05:54,062 --> 02:05:58,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Being none, I'm just going to pause for a second to deal with a Zoom issue.

1104
02:05:58,384 --> 02:06:04,968
[SPEAKER_10]: One second, please.

1105
02:06:18,394 --> 02:06:20,478
[SPEAKER_10]: CoB, Christina McLean she-her-hers

1106
02:06:37,460 --> 02:06:39,741
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, seeing none, we'll go to public participation.

1107
02:06:39,761 --> 02:06:56,348
[SPEAKER_10]: I will ask you to unmute, please state, or you know what, actually, I need the, sorry, the Zoom issues we're having is that the clerk's computer keeps throwing him off the Zoom and I realized I actually really need him fully capacitated for the public participation part so he can write down people's names.

1108
02:06:58,749 --> 02:07:00,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry for the interruption, folks, just give me a couple of minutes.

1109
02:07:08,435 --> 02:07:10,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Quirk, do you have co-hosting abilities again?

1110
02:07:11,437 --> 02:07:15,200
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think I have co-hosting abilities right now, but I have, I can, you unmuted me.

1111
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:16,281
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think I'm, I'm good.

1112
02:07:16,321 --> 02:07:18,262
[SPEAKER_16]: I, I don't see co-hosting abilities.

1113
02:07:18,402 --> 02:07:21,164
[SPEAKER_16]: The issue is my, I can't get on zoom on my computer in my office.

1114
02:07:21,204 --> 02:07:22,145
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to use my phone.

1115
02:07:22,746 --> 02:07:25,708
[SPEAKER_16]: And for some reason, it's not listing me as the host of the meeting anymore.

1116
02:07:26,448 --> 02:07:30,031
[SPEAKER_10]: On my end, it shows you as the host, but clearly is going on.

1117
02:07:31,212 --> 02:07:31,392
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1118
02:07:33,821 --> 02:07:35,822
[SPEAKER_16]: If you leave me unmuted, I can take roll calls.

1119
02:07:36,562 --> 02:07:36,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

1120
02:07:37,123 --> 02:07:37,503
[SPEAKER_10]: I will do that.

1121
02:07:37,523 --> 02:07:41,025
[SPEAKER_16]: I should be fine in terms of public participation, you know, taking names and addresses down.

1122
02:07:41,045 --> 02:07:41,605
[SPEAKER_16]: That should be fine.

1123
02:07:42,045 --> 02:07:42,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1124
02:07:42,385 --> 02:07:42,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

1125
02:07:42,966 --> 02:07:44,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks so much for your flexibility.

1126
02:07:47,688 --> 02:07:48,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1127
02:07:49,789 --> 02:07:51,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Going back to public participation.

1128
02:07:51,450 --> 02:07:55,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, all right, Daniel, we'll go to you first name and address for the record, please.

1129
02:07:55,732 --> 02:07:56,553
[SPEAKER_10]: And you have three minutes.

1130
02:08:00,335 --> 02:08:01,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, hi.

1131
02:08:01,844 --> 02:08:06,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Daniel Werner, I'm at 79 Marston Street in Medford.

1132
02:08:07,007 --> 02:08:08,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I'm trying to put on the video, but I can't.

1133
02:08:09,649 --> 02:08:10,549
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like on a different thing.

1134
02:08:12,410 --> 02:08:20,335
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was actually doing a deep dive on this today in terms of looking to do a ADU at our house.

1135
02:08:21,556 --> 02:08:23,677
[SPEAKER_08]: And also I strongly believe that we need more housing.

1136
02:08:25,278 --> 02:08:29,861
[SPEAKER_08]: So the thing that I was running into looking at all the regulations is the 15 foot setbacks.

1137
02:08:30,865 --> 02:08:36,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so the town has a 15 foot setback on, um, on any accessory use.

1138
02:08:37,527 --> 02:08:43,689
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think what that's going to mean, what that would mean at our house is that we'd have to use the only structure that could do it would be the garage.

1139
02:08:44,189 --> 02:08:55,992
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's going to be true at most of Medford, um, because the 15 foot setback, most of the lots, certainly in South Medford and a lot of the area North of the river too, are really, you know, 40 foot lots.

1140
02:08:56,392 --> 02:09:00,013
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's going to mean nothing could be built except for

1141
02:09:01,185 --> 02:09:07,149
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's a two-car garage, arguably you can convert the two-car garage to an ADU.

1142
02:09:07,669 --> 02:09:09,150
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of like a gray area.

1143
02:09:09,930 --> 02:09:12,532
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I was looking into the logistics of doing that.

1144
02:09:13,132 --> 02:09:18,475
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think realistically what would happen is you'd have to, you really have to demolish the garage.

1145
02:09:18,495 --> 02:09:21,817
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be the easiest way to do it because you're going to have to put plumbing underneath it.

1146
02:09:23,557 --> 02:09:29,460
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also the garages are too small because even a 2 car garage is only 400 square feet.

1147
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:30,380
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's pretty small.

1148
02:09:31,320 --> 02:09:32,741
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's restricted where it would be.

1149
02:09:34,722 --> 02:09:36,663
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I think 1 way to solve it would be to.

1150
02:09:38,132 --> 02:09:40,312
[SPEAKER_08]: One way to solve it would be to reduce the setbacks.

1151
02:09:41,373 --> 02:09:50,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Another way to solve it would be to allow like a gabled roof over these things and then increase the height limit, because right now the height limit is 15 feet.

1152
02:09:51,475 --> 02:10:00,377
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you increase the height limit to like 20 feet, then I think that would allow a second, you could call it a half story with a gabled roof so it still look attractive.

1153
02:10:00,397 --> 02:10:02,337
[SPEAKER_08]: It wouldn't be ugly for the neighbors.

1154
02:10:03,637 --> 02:10:06,938
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think if you don't, I think something has to be addressed either way.

1155
02:10:08,093 --> 02:10:20,002
[SPEAKER_08]: either in terms of the setbacks or the height, and making it clear the height, and then also making it clear that if something was demolished, you could rebuild something of the same, a structure of the same size.

1156
02:10:21,043 --> 02:10:24,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think the way it works now, it's not actually going to create housing.

1157
02:10:25,386 --> 02:10:33,972
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was reading about like the ADU law in LA, and it seemed like it took quite a while after it passed before they started getting built, because

1158
02:10:35,452 --> 02:10:38,815
[SPEAKER_08]: The law was a little confusing, so I do think it's important to make it clear.

1159
02:10:38,835 --> 02:10:44,722
[SPEAKER_08]: The sooner it's clear what the law is, then the sooner these are going to actually start getting built.

1160
02:10:45,122 --> 02:10:46,024
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's my feedback.

1161
02:10:46,464 --> 02:10:49,828
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I also think, so I think A, it's important in terms of creating housing.

1162
02:10:50,829 --> 02:11:01,338
[SPEAKER_08]: But B, it's also important, arguably legally, in terms of complying with the state law, because the state law says that towns shall not create unreasonable regulations that prevent these from getting built.

1163
02:11:01,578 --> 02:11:14,789
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think not that that's the intent here, because it's an existing law, but I think that's going to be the effect of these high setbacks is that the only places these are going to get built is maybe like West Medford or certain places that have large lots.

1164
02:11:15,930 --> 02:11:16,911
[SPEAKER_08]: So, thank you.

1165
02:11:18,669 --> 02:11:19,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Great comments, Daniel.

1166
02:11:19,830 --> 02:11:29,735
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's a really important thing for us to note and investigate either in this meeting or something to think about for the next draft.

1167
02:11:29,875 --> 02:11:30,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Paola, I see your hand is up.

1168
02:11:30,975 --> 02:11:32,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to respond directly?

1169
02:11:34,177 --> 02:11:35,617
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1170
02:11:35,637 --> 02:11:41,800
[SPEAKER_18]: So we did look into the current zoning, the setbacks.

1171
02:11:43,141 --> 02:11:45,862
[SPEAKER_18]: We also need to be conforming with the building code

1172
02:11:46,658 --> 02:11:53,301
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, but what it says in the law is that whichever more permissive.

1173
02:11:54,022 --> 02:11:54,422
[SPEAKER_18]: From.

1174
02:11:55,383 --> 02:12:02,486
[SPEAKER_18]: The single unit dwelling accessory structure and then if it's depending on the district that it is.

1175
02:12:03,267 --> 02:12:07,949
[SPEAKER_18]: So there are different numbers that we should looked into.

1176
02:12:07,969 --> 02:12:11,751
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, it is true that for the front setback is 15.

1177
02:12:14,338 --> 02:12:19,040
[SPEAKER_18]: But then for the rear, for an accessory structure, is three foot.

1178
02:12:19,580 --> 02:12:26,283
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, we have to be careful with this, and that's when we need to communicate with building commissioner about what would be best.

1179
02:12:26,903 --> 02:12:31,986
[SPEAKER_18]: I think building code is 10 foot between.

1180
02:12:33,406 --> 02:12:35,667
[SPEAKER_18]: We are doing a unit, so we need to be careful with that.

1181
02:12:35,727 --> 02:12:37,508
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a garage anymore they use.

1182
02:12:39,264 --> 02:12:41,586
[SPEAKER_18]: And then about the height, it's always the most permissive.

1183
02:12:41,646 --> 02:12:54,657
[SPEAKER_18]: So you would have two and a half in any residential, in the residential districts, because it's permitted that two and a half.

1184
02:12:54,677 --> 02:12:57,239
[SPEAKER_18]: So you don't have the restriction of 15 foot.

1185
02:12:57,619 --> 02:13:02,643
[SPEAKER_18]: So we need to look into the most permissive from accessory structure and single unit dwelling.

1186
02:13:03,244 --> 02:13:04,465
[SPEAKER_18]: Just wanted to clarify that.

1187
02:13:07,987 --> 02:13:08,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Paula.

1188
02:13:08,547 --> 02:13:09,328
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's helpful.

1189
02:13:09,368 --> 02:13:16,394
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's in considering the dimensional standards governing what's possible for the ADUs.

1190
02:13:16,954 --> 02:13:29,063
[SPEAKER_10]: It is about conformity with the building code, but when we're considering the interplay of the code regulations on the principal dwelling and then on the ADU, it's always the more permissive of those regulations that can be used.

1191
02:13:29,864 --> 02:13:34,668
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that this is something for us to take a closer look at before we get the final version.

1192
02:13:35,188 --> 02:13:41,936
[SPEAKER_10]: of these updates to make sure that we're taking a fine tooth comb to how this plays out in each of our districts.

1193
02:13:42,657 --> 02:13:47,763
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that we're all aligned with the perspective that was shared.

1194
02:13:48,123 --> 02:13:50,386
[SPEAKER_10]: We're doing this update because we want more ADUs to be built.

1195
02:13:50,946 --> 02:13:53,287
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the reason that we're expanding them into all residential sub-districts.

1196
02:13:53,307 --> 02:13:56,328
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the reason we're going further than the state mandates.

1197
02:13:56,668 --> 02:14:13,133
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we do want to be turning over other stone when it comes to making sure that the new language makes it easy for people to take us up on these regulations and add ADUs beneficially in a way that's good for property owners and also good for the community overall.

1198
02:14:15,561 --> 02:14:18,583
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll be making a note of those, talk about that more.

1199
02:14:20,344 --> 02:14:22,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Next up, we'll go to Mark.

1200
02:14:22,705 --> 02:14:24,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record, please.

1201
02:14:24,807 --> 02:14:25,607
[SPEAKER_10]: And you have three minutes.

1202
02:14:33,692 --> 02:14:35,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Mark just asked you to unmute.

1203
02:14:35,734 --> 02:14:36,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll click again.

1204
02:14:36,534 --> 02:14:41,017
[SPEAKER_10]: You're gonna have to click a button to unmute yourself.

1205
02:14:46,304 --> 02:14:49,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Try one more time, and then I'll go to somebody else and try to come back to you later.

1206
02:14:49,507 --> 02:14:54,110
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we will come back to you.

1207
02:14:55,231 --> 02:14:57,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Next, I will go to Gaston.

1208
02:14:58,594 --> 02:14:59,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record, please.

1209
02:14:59,675 --> 02:15:00,235
[SPEAKER_10]: You have three minutes.

1210
02:15:01,837 --> 02:15:02,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1211
02:15:02,537 --> 02:15:04,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Gaston here, 61 Stingley Road.

1212
02:15:04,239 --> 02:15:05,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a few questions for Paula.

1213
02:15:05,900 --> 02:15:09,463
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first one is on page five, I believe, section four.

1214
02:15:10,270 --> 02:15:12,472
[SPEAKER_06]: special permit for local ADUs.

1215
02:15:13,012 --> 02:15:21,157
[SPEAKER_06]: So it lists the residential zoning districts NR1, NR2, NR3, UR1, UR2.

1216
02:15:21,358 --> 02:15:28,803
[SPEAKER_06]: So are the NRs correct to be listed there, or is this only for UR1 and UR2, the local ADU?

1217
02:15:34,732 --> 02:15:38,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Don, if you want, if you have multiple questions, feel free to state them all.

1218
02:15:38,936 --> 02:15:55,170
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'll... OK, so the second question, which is related, depending on the answer to this, is, are more than one or is more than one ADU allowed to be built also on neighborhood residential districts?

1219
02:15:55,410 --> 02:15:59,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is that only for urban residential one and urban residential two?

1220
02:16:00,900 --> 02:16:04,903
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I had a question related to the 50%.

1221
02:16:05,383 --> 02:16:16,550
[SPEAKER_06]: So I see why there's even an example in the notes I'm seeing here about like, for example, you know, barns and things like that, which could be very, very big in terms of area.

1222
02:16:17,944 --> 02:16:28,830
[SPEAKER_06]: and using that as an ADU, but then I don't see why it's necessary to allow more than 50, because can you just switch which one is the principal dwelling and which one becomes the ADU?

1223
02:16:28,850 --> 02:16:34,513
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's say, for example, you have a house that it's 1,500 square feet and then you have a barn that is, I don't know, 2,500.

1224
02:16:35,734 --> 02:16:45,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, so instead of the ADU being bigger than the house, can you just make the principal dwelling the barn and then the house becomes the ADU?

1225
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:55,325
[SPEAKER_06]: So if that's possible, then I don't see a case where we would, you know, where in case in the 50% would be necessary, you would just swap them.

1226
02:16:55,945 --> 02:16:58,027
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I'm not sure.

1227
02:16:58,407 --> 02:17:01,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I think those are all the questions.

1228
02:17:01,369 --> 02:17:03,710
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, so the first one is on section four,

1229
02:17:04,699 --> 02:17:09,861
[SPEAKER_06]: whether the neighborhood residential districts should actually be listed as being locally view.

1230
02:17:10,061 --> 02:17:24,045
[SPEAKER_06]: And if the answer is yes, then I'm confused in terms of the definition between protected and local, because my understanding was a local was for the zones where single family houses are not allowed, which would be the urban residential zoning districts.

1231
02:17:25,225 --> 02:17:31,947
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the question about the half of the size of the principal dwelling.

1232
02:17:34,305 --> 02:17:35,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for your questions, Gaston.

1233
02:17:35,529 --> 02:17:38,798
[SPEAKER_10]: So if I understand it right, I think you're asking, is it redundant to list?

1234
02:17:41,675 --> 02:17:48,860
[SPEAKER_10]: NR 1, 2, and 3 under local ADUs, because per the state law, ADUs in those sub-districts are protected ADUs, so.

1235
02:17:49,640 --> 02:18:00,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, and then if more than one is allowed in NR 1, 2, and 3, and if that is the case, I believe that the second one will be a local ADU, according to my understanding.

1236
02:18:00,607 --> 02:18:04,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I believe that's correct, but I'll go to Paola to run down your three questions.

1237
02:18:05,972 --> 02:18:07,633
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, so that is correct.

1238
02:18:07,693 --> 02:18:21,538
[SPEAKER_18]: So the local ADU, if you permit a second ADU on the NR1, NR2, NR3, which we are doing, then you should have the special local ADU.

1239
02:18:21,678 --> 02:18:24,299
[SPEAKER_18]: It wouldn't be the protected anymore, but the local ADU.

1240
02:18:24,659 --> 02:18:28,381
[SPEAKER_18]: So anything that is on the local ADU will apply to that second unit.

1241
02:18:28,801 --> 02:18:30,642
[SPEAKER_18]: And it would be by special permit.

1242
02:18:31,022 --> 02:18:33,843
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's why you see it in all of them.

1243
02:18:35,198 --> 02:18:37,159
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the first question.

1244
02:18:38,579 --> 02:18:40,140
[SPEAKER_18]: First and two together.

1245
02:18:40,760 --> 02:18:42,540
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the third question.

1246
02:18:43,941 --> 02:18:51,383
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is something that somebody has brought also to the building commissioner, that idea of can we have

1247
02:18:52,148 --> 02:18:56,189
[SPEAKER_18]: a barn do that as an ADU and then change it?

1248
02:18:56,309 --> 02:19:00,950
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is our, so it, we don't know, it's a very good question.

1249
02:19:01,430 --> 02:19:19,655
[SPEAKER_18]: And we will pass that to our legal counsel, because our understanding is that you need to, you need your principal structure is the one that is going to tell you whether you can have an ADU and apply for an ADU.

1250
02:19:20,411 --> 02:19:22,352
[SPEAKER_18]: And so then you couldn't do that.

1251
02:19:23,172 --> 02:19:42,077
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, what we are looking for those types of situations is that if you have like a historical barn and you want to convert it into an ADU, that we can allow for that protection, that historical protection, and to maintain those to allow bigger ADUs.

1252
02:19:42,177 --> 02:19:46,458
[SPEAKER_18]: That's something that we also want to look into the bylaw.

1253
02:19:47,880 --> 02:19:48,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

1254
02:19:48,841 --> 02:19:52,426
[SPEAKER_06]: So, based on this answer very quickly.

1255
02:19:52,466 --> 02:20:04,541
[SPEAKER_06]: So, then I, I think we should look into the 1,200 square feet for local ADUs that are a second ADU on a neighborhood residential district because.

1256
02:20:05,802 --> 02:20:20,248
[SPEAKER_06]: It could happen that we have a principal dwelling, a protected-use ADU that is 900 square feet, and then someone wants to have a second one, and now the second one actually can be up to 1,200 square feet, which to me looks like an inconsistency.

1257
02:20:20,308 --> 02:20:25,089
[SPEAKER_06]: This would only apply for neighborhood residential because, again, for urban residential, they would all be local ADUs.

1258
02:20:25,729 --> 02:20:29,211
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's something that we might want to take a look into.

1259
02:20:29,271 --> 02:20:29,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

1260
02:20:31,273 --> 02:20:32,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for noting that, Gaston.

1261
02:20:32,834 --> 02:20:35,635
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll definitely take a note about that and look into it further.

1262
02:20:37,456 --> 02:20:37,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

1263
02:20:38,217 --> 02:20:39,778
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll go to Dave.

1264
02:20:40,458 --> 02:20:41,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record, please.

1265
02:20:42,399 --> 02:20:42,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.

1266
02:20:45,541 --> 02:20:45,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1267
02:20:46,041 --> 02:20:47,942
[SPEAKER_07]: David McKenna to Vine Street.

1268
02:20:48,763 --> 02:20:51,584
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to echo everything that Daniel Werner said.

1269
02:20:51,604 --> 02:20:55,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he made some really great points about how the dimensional requirements could make

1270
02:20:57,418 --> 02:21:02,360
[SPEAKER_07]: it more complicated or confusing or challenging to actually build an ADU.

1271
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:13,143
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the 15-foot height limit, for example, is not a real limit, then it could be removed from the zoning code or clarified in some way so that people are not misled.

1272
02:21:13,803 --> 02:21:17,705
[SPEAKER_07]: The setbacks, you know, garages are often three feet from the lot line.

1273
02:21:17,845 --> 02:21:20,385
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't mean that they're only three feet away from a building.

1274
02:21:20,906 --> 02:21:22,466
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't mean that there's a fire hazard.

1275
02:21:23,706 --> 02:21:25,227
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, I think that

1276
02:21:25,937 --> 02:21:31,658
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, if it's good enough for a garage, you know, I think it's reasonable for an ADU that could look like a garage.

1277
02:21:32,378 --> 02:21:43,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and, uh, you know, there could certainly be requirements around, you know, if you want to be within one to three feet of a lot line, you have to be, uh, built out of a non flammable material.

1278
02:21:44,661 --> 02:21:51,303
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think there's a lot of ways to provide flexibility, um, on some of the smaller historic lots that have going, which is that are unused.

1279
02:21:52,363 --> 02:21:52,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

1280
02:21:53,507 --> 02:21:56,909
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think one and a half stories for the ADU makes a lot of sense.

1281
02:21:57,769 --> 02:22:00,630
[SPEAKER_07]: So the second small half story tucked within a roof.

1282
02:22:02,651 --> 02:22:21,300
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if I understood correctly, the restriction on short-term rentals is only for when the principal building is a rental, then the ADU cannot be rented short-term, meaning an owner occupied principal dwelling could rent out a short-term ADU.

1283
02:22:22,573 --> 02:22:27,155
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that we should ban short-term rental use on these ADUs.

1284
02:22:27,215 --> 02:22:31,318
[SPEAKER_07]: We want a lot of ADUs to be built, but we want them to provide housing options.

1285
02:22:31,338 --> 02:22:34,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually lived in an ADU after college for two years.

1286
02:22:35,180 --> 02:22:35,640
[SPEAKER_07]: My rent was $200.

1287
02:22:35,680 --> 02:22:38,321
[SPEAKER_07]: The ADU was about 300 square feet.

1288
02:22:38,922 --> 02:22:39,862
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was working a lot.

1289
02:22:40,262 --> 02:22:40,983
[SPEAKER_07]: I was always out.

1290
02:22:41,523 --> 02:22:43,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't need, you know, I didn't have a family yet.

1291
02:22:43,864 --> 02:22:44,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't need a lot of space.

1292
02:22:46,966 --> 02:22:51,168
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was a very affordable option because, you know, it offered

1293
02:22:51,781 --> 02:22:53,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Very little and so, um.

1294
02:22:55,162 --> 02:23:02,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I, I don't think that we should incentivize or allow the short term rentals in any of these to the extent possible.

1295
02:23:02,505 --> 02:23:05,086
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, that's it.

1296
02:23:05,166 --> 02:23:06,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for your time.

1297
02:23:06,367 --> 02:23:10,148
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I'm misunderstanding about the short term, I guess, then that would be a question.

1298
02:23:10,589 --> 02:23:14,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you so much.

1299
02:23:14,490 --> 02:23:15,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Dave really appreciate those comments.

1300
02:23:16,111 --> 02:23:21,333
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, in hearing you reflect on that section, it occurs to me that my paraphrasing earlier might have actually.

1301
02:23:23,270 --> 02:23:26,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Miss characterized or misunderstood part of what was stated there.

1302
02:23:27,291 --> 02:23:29,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Paola, could you speak to that point briefly please?

1303
02:23:30,152 --> 02:23:33,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it, I think that Dave's read might actually be correct.

1304
02:23:33,272 --> 02:23:39,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it that the ADU may be a short-term rental if the principal dwelling is owner occupied?

1305
02:23:40,914 --> 02:23:44,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is it just in any case, the minimum rental period is 30 days?

1306
02:23:46,155 --> 02:23:56,581
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so it says where the accessory dwelling unit or the principal dwelling is occupied as a rental unit, the minimum occupancy rental term shall be 30 days.

1307
02:23:57,382 --> 02:24:10,109
[SPEAKER_18]: So in this case, as I understand it, I can go to legal counsel and ask, or if Director Hunt can clarify this, but my understanding is that any of them

1308
02:24:11,512 --> 02:24:20,297
[SPEAKER_18]: if any of them is rented, even also the principal dwelling, the rent has to be more than 30 days.

1309
02:24:20,357 --> 02:24:21,778
[SPEAKER_18]: So it cannot be a short term.

1310
02:24:22,058 --> 02:24:25,960
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the conclusion that I get from it.

1311
02:24:26,541 --> 02:24:28,882
[SPEAKER_18]: But we can look at it and make sure.

1312
02:24:29,720 --> 02:24:30,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, great.

1313
02:24:30,341 --> 02:24:30,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for that.

1314
02:24:31,042 --> 02:24:38,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, make sure it makes sense to me to run that by our attorney on the zoning project and just make sure that that's correct.

1315
02:24:39,455 --> 02:24:43,442
[SPEAKER_10]: As I stated earlier, my preference would also be to have

1316
02:24:45,238 --> 02:24:51,260
[SPEAKER_10]: to not be in any way encouraging or incentivizing the use of ADUs as short-term rentals.

1317
02:24:53,181 --> 02:25:05,086
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a lot of out-of-compliance short-term rentals in the community already, and I think the best use of these would be to add housing and a version of housing that we don't have a lot of in the community already.

1318
02:25:06,026 --> 02:25:08,367
[SPEAKER_10]: So it'd be great to confirm that, and thank you for bringing it up, Dave.

1319
02:25:11,203 --> 02:25:14,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Go next to Martha, name and address for the record please.

1320
02:25:14,787 --> 02:25:16,389
[SPEAKER_10]: You have three minutes.

1321
02:25:18,010 --> 02:25:22,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, yes, Martha Andrus, 45 Kilgore Avenue, West Medford.

1322
02:25:23,917 --> 02:25:39,667
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to echo what Daniel Warner said about increasing the allowable height of the ADU and also decreasing the side setback requirement.

1323
02:25:41,367 --> 02:25:50,753
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's, you know, just pragmatically, there are a lot of people who might be able to convert their garage or build a building similar to a

1324
02:25:51,497 --> 02:26:02,606
[SPEAKER_15]: two-car garage in Medford that would need those less strict requirements in order to make a viable unit.

1325
02:26:05,909 --> 02:26:11,214
[SPEAKER_15]: As an architect, I can tell you having worked on these, 15 feet is too limiting.

1326
02:26:14,056 --> 02:26:18,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, I think we need very clear restrictions on the Airbnb.

1327
02:26:20,014 --> 02:26:22,256
[SPEAKER_15]: options, the less than 30-day rental.

1328
02:26:23,697 --> 02:26:30,023
[SPEAKER_15]: And the present wording, to me, is not as clear as it could be.

1329
02:26:30,183 --> 02:26:32,405
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is our opportunity to get that right.

1330
02:26:32,625 --> 02:26:33,025
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1331
02:26:36,108 --> 02:26:36,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

1332
02:26:36,308 --> 02:26:37,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Martha.

1333
02:26:37,629 --> 02:26:38,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Really appreciate that.

1334
02:26:40,492 --> 02:26:41,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Mark, I'll go to you.

1335
02:26:41,953 --> 02:26:43,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record, please.

1336
02:26:44,315 --> 02:26:44,956
[SPEAKER_10]: You have three minutes.

1337
02:26:48,916 --> 02:26:53,845
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to click the ask to unmute button that should, the button to unmute should pop up on your end.

1338
02:27:12,659 --> 02:27:12,879
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1339
02:27:12,899 --> 02:27:14,180
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure why this isn't working.

1340
02:27:14,220 --> 02:27:14,941
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.

1341
02:27:16,121 --> 02:27:17,682
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't seem to get your audio.

1342
02:27:20,364 --> 02:27:26,108
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're not able to unmute before we adjourn this meeting, please feel free to email me your comments.

1343
02:27:26,128 --> 02:27:31,392
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll make sure that we get you a response from myself, the zoning consultant, or city planning staff expeditiously.

1344
02:27:31,412 --> 02:27:33,893
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll try again before we give up.

1345
02:27:35,114 --> 02:27:36,555
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll go next to Kirsten.

1346
02:27:37,156 --> 02:27:38,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record, please.

1347
02:27:38,336 --> 02:27:39,037
[SPEAKER_10]: You have three minutes.

1348
02:27:43,223 --> 02:27:43,643
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1349
02:27:44,144 --> 02:27:50,090
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Keith Ganado and Kirsten Kingsley of Kingsley Ganado Architects in Arlington Heights, Illinois.

1350
02:27:50,131 --> 02:27:52,493
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for allowing us to be part of your conversation.

1351
02:27:54,295 --> 02:27:59,921
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a unique circumstance, which a few of you are already aware, where our client,

1352
02:28:01,447 --> 02:28:07,270
[SPEAKER_12]: is interested in moving their elderly parents into an ADU.

1353
02:28:07,330 --> 02:28:09,211
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're busy pushing this along.

1354
02:28:10,131 --> 02:28:23,077
[SPEAKER_12]: And the question is really, we have a couple of things that are in the documents that we're asking for that don't seem to fit cleanly in ADU or the zoning criteria.

1355
02:28:25,127 --> 02:28:37,430
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to know if you'd have some direction for what the best way is that we won't bog your process down and we'll be able to move forward through the chain as best we can.

1356
02:28:39,231 --> 02:28:47,933
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we have an accessory dwelling unit in the front yard joined to a two-car garage is what we're talking about.

1357
02:28:47,953 --> 02:28:54,855
[SPEAKER_12]: So in those ways, we're a bit maybe outside the context of this and just wondering if we're in the right place.

1358
02:28:55,785 --> 02:28:56,105
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1359
02:28:56,726 --> 02:28:58,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thank you so much for your question.

1360
02:28:58,387 --> 02:29:02,410
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate you trying to move that project forward.

1361
02:29:02,510 --> 02:29:07,354
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that this conversation is probably a bit broader scope than will be useful for you.

1362
02:29:08,174 --> 02:29:15,560
[SPEAKER_10]: We're talking about kind of, as I'm sure you know and have gathered, this is a bit of a higher level conversation and those particularities.

1363
02:29:15,620 --> 02:29:18,062
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that our building commissioner and our city planning staff

1364
02:29:18,582 --> 02:29:26,506
[SPEAKER_10]: would probably be very capable of giving you some useful instructions and next steps.

1365
02:29:28,767 --> 02:29:33,329
[SPEAKER_10]: If you do not have their contact information already, it's easily findable on the city website.

1366
02:29:33,369 --> 02:29:41,093
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like you might be in touch with a couple of those city staff members already, but I think that'll be a better source of information for you than this kind of higher level discussion.

1367
02:29:44,220 --> 02:29:52,245
[SPEAKER_10]: If you do need any contact info for city staff, please do feel free to reach out to me if you're not able to get in touch with the relevant parties and I will connect you.

1368
02:29:55,247 --> 02:29:57,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Go next to Tara.

1369
02:29:58,008 --> 02:30:00,850
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll ask you to unmute and you'll have three minutes.

1370
02:30:00,950 --> 02:30:02,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record, please.

1371
02:30:06,323 --> 02:30:07,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for allowing me.

1372
02:30:08,064 --> 02:30:10,765
[SPEAKER_13]: My address is 397 High Street.

1373
02:30:11,806 --> 02:30:27,074
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wanted to also echo Daniel's comment about side setbacks being reduced to possibly an old Medford standard, which I understand is more around seven or eight feet.

1374
02:30:27,774 --> 02:30:35,858
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can see that design standard throughout much of Medford, especially West Medford and Central Medford.

1375
02:30:37,842 --> 02:30:55,470
[SPEAKER_13]: The other question I had was about the double ADUs and also the potential of attaching it in a kind of a fashion that would be attached to the main house such that it would extend the main house visually

1376
02:30:56,642 --> 02:30:59,284
[SPEAKER_13]: and they could be stacked on top of each other.

1377
02:30:59,944 --> 02:31:06,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Now that might, I don't know how that might run into a height issue.

1378
02:31:06,168 --> 02:31:19,837
[SPEAKER_13]: It is possible that the, if it is attached to the main residence, then there is no accessory structure and it is going by the height requirement of the principal structure.

1379
02:31:21,691 --> 02:31:27,324
[SPEAKER_13]: And is there any type of guidance on stacking two ADUs?

1380
02:31:32,689 --> 02:31:33,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for your questions.

1381
02:31:33,930 --> 02:32:01,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Paolo or city planning staff, is there any initial reactions to that question around, is there guidance in the scenario of two ADUs on one lot, is there guidance around, is it possible to do stacking like Tara described, and how would height permissions apply in this case where both of the ADUs are attached to the principal structure, if that's allowable?

1382
02:32:02,928 --> 02:32:10,634
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also something that we can circle back to if it requires further research.

1383
02:32:10,654 --> 02:32:15,879
[SPEAKER_10]: I see Planner Evans has her hand up, or Paola, we can go to you first, if you have a reaction.

1384
02:32:15,899 --> 02:32:19,402
[SPEAKER_18]: I can talk later.

1385
02:32:19,422 --> 02:32:21,303
[SPEAKER_18]: Evans, you can go.

1386
02:32:22,364 --> 02:32:22,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

1387
02:32:22,564 --> 02:32:23,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Danielle, please go ahead.

1388
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:37,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you sorry, I had gotten booted from the meeting and then had to rejoin.

1389
02:32:37,541 --> 02:32:40,522
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, lost cohost permissions.

1390
02:32:41,462 --> 02:32:45,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, so my understanding is that.

1391
02:32:47,503 --> 02:32:51,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so the law protects, um.

1392
02:32:52,185 --> 02:32:56,206
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, whatever, if it's attached or internal or detached, so, um.

1393
02:32:58,302 --> 02:33:07,387
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has to be the most permissive, so the height would could match what is the maximum allowed for the principal dwelling, whether it's attached or detached.

1394
02:33:07,487 --> 02:33:16,412
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if the height for the 2 stacked ADUs doesn't exceed the maximum height for principal dwelling, then I don't see how that wouldn't be allowed.

1395
02:33:16,432 --> 02:33:22,295
[SPEAKER_03]: But the 2nd unit, the law actually requires that it be by special permit.

1396
02:33:22,375 --> 02:33:25,216
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like an oddity of the way that the legislature wrote it.

1397
02:33:25,296 --> 02:33:25,917
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the.

1398
02:33:27,447 --> 02:33:31,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, regulations that were promulgated by HLC, we have to include that.

1399
02:33:31,848 --> 02:33:32,448
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why.

1400
02:33:32,468 --> 02:33:38,170
[SPEAKER_03]: It requires a special permit yet, but I don't know if that answer the question.

1401
02:33:38,470 --> 02:33:38,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1402
02:33:38,870 --> 02:33:40,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to get caught back up.

1403
02:33:42,791 --> 02:33:46,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I definitely heard clearly that the, um, kind of the.

1404
02:33:49,113 --> 02:33:53,975
[SPEAKER_10]: the height allowed for the principal structure would apply in this case, because we go by what's most permissible.

1405
02:33:55,716 --> 02:34:03,240
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not hearing that there's, I would be surprised if there was guidance already on the stacking of two ADUs, both attached to a principal structure.

1406
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:07,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know, Danielle, if there happens to be like design.

1407
02:34:08,002 --> 02:34:10,424
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no prohibition to that.

1408
02:34:12,745 --> 02:34:13,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at a,

1409
02:34:14,419 --> 02:34:20,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been to a couple different webinars, and it sounds like there's also some confusion from the folks running them.

1410
02:34:23,426 --> 02:34:24,567
[SPEAKER_03]: What exactly are the roles?

1411
02:34:24,727 --> 02:34:33,314
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like this might be a case where there is maybe not the most readily available precedent or guidance currently.

1412
02:34:36,650 --> 02:34:51,937
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think this might, unless there's further guidance from Paola on this, this might be another great candidate for following up with the city's building commissioner directly, who might be able to give you more guidance that's specific to your situation.

1413
02:34:51,957 --> 02:34:55,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Paola, anything that you want to add on this?

1414
02:34:59,721 --> 02:35:02,162
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Danielle answered perfectly.

1415
02:35:02,755 --> 02:35:03,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, great.

1416
02:35:03,656 --> 02:35:03,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1417
02:35:03,956 --> 02:35:04,996
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you for the question, Tara.

1418
02:35:06,477 --> 02:35:06,757
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1419
02:35:07,678 --> 02:35:14,382
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's anybody who wants to attempt to speak in public participation again, or anybody who wants to speak a second time, please raise your hand.

1420
02:35:17,797 --> 02:35:22,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, I think that we have, I think this has been an especially productive round of public participation.

1421
02:35:22,499 --> 02:35:28,341
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been taking a lot of notes on some very specific feedback that we have from community members.

1422
02:35:29,621 --> 02:35:31,202
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all certainly well heard and well taken.

1423
02:35:31,222 --> 02:35:43,106
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be looking deeper into all of these as we dig deeper into dimensional requirements for the ADUs and looking at how they interact with principal structures in the various districts.

1424
02:35:43,607 --> 02:35:44,927
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Mark, let's give it another go.

1425
02:35:44,947 --> 02:35:47,008
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm asking you to unmute.

1426
02:35:55,307 --> 02:35:57,188
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm asking you to unmute once more.

1427
02:35:57,208 --> 02:36:10,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.

1428
02:36:10,673 --> 02:36:13,994
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like your Zoom does not want you to speak today, but rest assured that we do.

1429
02:36:14,134 --> 02:36:17,216
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize that you can't seem to come off mute.

1430
02:36:19,537 --> 02:36:20,457
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go to Marie.

1431
02:36:21,822 --> 02:36:23,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record, please.

1432
02:36:23,323 --> 02:36:23,983
[SPEAKER_10]: You have three minutes.

1433
02:36:24,283 --> 02:36:27,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Marie Izzo, 29 Pilgrim Road, Medford, Mass.

1434
02:36:27,985 --> 02:36:38,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell me what the minimal number of square footage for a lot with a one-family home, what the requirement is to be able to actually add an ADU?

1435
02:36:38,511 --> 02:36:46,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a minimal number of square feet required in a one-family zoning to add an ADU?

1436
02:36:48,993 --> 02:36:49,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the question.

1437
02:36:49,773 --> 02:36:58,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Pamela or Danielle, do you happen to know offhand, is there a minimum square footage or might it be just dependent on if there's the minimum allowable setbacks?

1438
02:36:59,816 --> 02:37:01,477
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, Director Hunt, go ahead.

1439
02:37:02,517 --> 02:37:09,700
[SPEAKER_02]: If the single family house exists, then there's no minimum square footage required to add an ADU.

1440
02:37:10,920 --> 02:37:15,361
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's an empty lot, there's a minimum square footage to build the first single family house.

1441
02:37:16,002 --> 02:37:16,762
[SPEAKER_04]: And what would that be?

1442
02:37:18,469 --> 02:37:25,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now it's 5,000 square feet in most of our zones and 7,000 in a few of them.

1443
02:37:25,974 --> 02:37:30,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to check if that was single family, one or two, but that would be for an empty lot.

1444
02:37:30,618 --> 02:37:30,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1445
02:37:30,998 --> 02:37:37,303
[SPEAKER_02]: If the house already exists, then you don't, there's no minimum square footage for the ADU.

1446
02:37:37,503 --> 02:37:38,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?

1447
02:37:38,944 --> 02:37:39,284
[SPEAKER_04]: It does.

1448
02:37:39,585 --> 02:37:39,845
[SPEAKER_04]: It does.

1449
02:37:40,105 --> 02:37:40,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

1450
02:37:40,866 --> 02:37:41,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1451
02:37:41,426 --> 02:37:42,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

1452
02:37:42,107 --> 02:37:44,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

1453
02:37:47,277 --> 02:37:47,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

1454
02:37:47,597 --> 02:37:48,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Paola, go ahead.

1455
02:37:49,619 --> 02:37:57,445
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, just to add to that, even if the house, the current house, is a non-conforming, you can also build an ADU.

1456
02:37:58,286 --> 02:38:06,633
[SPEAKER_18]: So it doesn't matter that your house, your current house, is a non-conforming by size setbacks or whatever, you can build an ADU.

1457
02:38:07,394 --> 02:38:09,655
[SPEAKER_18]: Just to clarify that.

1458
02:38:09,675 --> 02:38:12,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for that clarification.

1459
02:38:16,440 --> 02:38:16,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

1460
02:38:16,640 --> 02:38:22,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this has been a very substantive conversation across two topics.

1461
02:38:22,924 --> 02:38:30,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all very much, community members, city staff, councillors alike, for your feedback on the updates to the ADU's ordinance.

1462
02:38:30,268 --> 02:38:33,870
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that there's a lot for us to take back and incorporate into our next draft.

1463
02:38:35,531 --> 02:38:41,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Ditto for the draft in progress of the Medford Square zoning that we discussed earlier in the meeting.

1464
02:38:43,157 --> 02:38:52,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, it's getting late, so I will entertain any further comments, questions or motions to adjourn from my fellow counselors.

1465
02:38:57,348 --> 02:38:58,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Callahan.

1466
02:39:00,491 --> 02:39:01,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I will second that then.

1467
02:39:01,472 --> 02:39:02,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

1468
02:39:03,753 --> 02:39:07,656
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1469
02:39:08,457 --> 02:39:09,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, whenever you're ready.

1470
02:39:16,856 --> 02:39:21,779
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank Paola for the very thorough presentation and discussion tonight.

1471
02:39:21,819 --> 02:39:23,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much, as always, for walking us through it.

1472
02:39:24,100 --> 02:39:33,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, city staff, for being here to offer your insight on our discussions, and thank you to all community members for being a part of our ongoing zoning discussions.

1473
02:39:34,986 --> 02:39:37,008
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm ready whenever you are, Madam Vice President.

1474
02:39:37,508 --> 02:39:37,708
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

1475
02:39:39,869 --> 02:39:40,970
[SPEAKER_16]: President Behrs is absent.

1476
02:39:41,410 --> 02:39:42,071
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Callahan?

1477
02:39:42,731 --> 02:39:42,911
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1478
02:39:44,112 --> 02:39:44,692
