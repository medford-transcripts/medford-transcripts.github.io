    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=0.531s">for</a>  decades, decades, decades, decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5.292s">Even</a>  before finishing her doctorate, she was conducting independent research at the University of Chicago's Marine Biological Laboratory, studying how cells respond to ultraviolet light, hormones, and experimental drugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=22.417s">These</a>  were early steps towards understanding melanoma at the cellular level. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=29.53s">After</a>  graduation, she joined Harlem Hospital Cancer Research Foundation, working alongside Dr. Jane C. Wright. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=38.475s">There,</a>  Jewel mastered human tissue culture, growing real cancer cells from patient biopsies so drugs could be tested before reaching human bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=52.523s">It</a>  changed cancer treatment forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=57.408s">It</a>  changed cancer treatment forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=63.871s">It</a>  changed cancer treatment forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=71.614s">At</a>  just 28, Jewel found her own tissue culture lab at the University of Illinois College of Medicine. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=79.93s">a</a>  black woman leading independent cancer research in the 1950s. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=86.016s">While</a>  the funding committees doubted her competence and colleagues questioned her data and journals fought to minimize her authorship, Jewel, she persisted anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=100.693s">Her</a>  melanoma research revealed how melanin protects cells from UV damage and how cancer cells fundamentally differ from healthy ones, finding that became cornerstones of modern skin cancer science. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=117.782s">That</a>  became cornerstones of modern skin cancer science. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=124.625s">Then</a>  came the work that saved lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=127.666s">In</a>  the early 1960s, Juul helped demonstrate the power of methotrexate against skin cancer, lung cancer, and childhood leukemia. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=139.651s">Research</a>  that helped establish one of the most important chemotherapy drugs in medical history. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=147.395s">One</a>  of the most important chemotherapy medical drugs in history. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=154.76s">a</a>  drug still used today and saving lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=158.124s">But</a>  Jewel never forgot the hallway at NYU. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=163.15s">She</a>  understood that brilliance means nothing if access is denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=170.492s">So</a>  she turned her attention to opening doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=174.734s">She</a>  became a college dean, then earned a second deanship, and in 1981, she broke yet another barrier as the first African American woman president of California State University, Fullerton. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=191.751s">There</a>  she built scholarships, tutoring programs, and research opportunities for students who had been told, just as she once was, that they did not belong in science. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=206.615s">When</a>  she retired, she kept mentoring, kept advising, and kept lifting. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=214.988s">When</a>  Dr. Jewel Plummer Cobb died in 2017 at the age of 92, she left behind more than discoveries. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=224.493s">She</a>  left behind lives saved, institutions transformed, and generations of scientists who never had to stand alone in a hallway and demand to be seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=239.125s">She</a>  was denied entry because of the color of her skin. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=244.249s">She</a>  showed up anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=247.052s">She</a>  showed up anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=250.715s">And</a>  by refusing to accept a closed door, she changed science. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=256.5s">And</a>  who gets to belong in it forever?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=279.318s">Good</a>  morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=279.738s">It</a>  seems the spirit of the 60s has returned in every way. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=290.303s">Remembering</a>  John Lewis, on July 23rd, 2020, Mr. Ray Sean Ray of the renowned Brookings Institute shared this reflection on the late US Congressman <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=310.102s">John</a>  Lewis, titled, Five Things John Lewis Taught Us About Getting In Good Trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=323.285s">Indeed,</a>  yes, indeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=326.965s">Get</a>  in good trouble, necessary trouble, and redeem the soul of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=338.722s">John</a>  Lewis made this statement on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama on March 1st, 2020 commemorating the tragic events of Bloody Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=356.729s">Bloody</a>  Sunday occurred on March 7th, 1965 as peaceful protesters were beaten by law enforcement <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=365.35s">something</a>  we're too familiar with these days, for crossing the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=372.374s">Lewis</a>  and others, like Amelia Boynton Robinson, were beaten so badly they were hospitalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=380.398s">The</a>  context behind the march is significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=383.459s">The</a>  600-person civil rights march was actually about police brutality. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=390.764s">Jimmy</a>  Lee Jackson, a 26-year-old church deacon, was killed by James Barnard Fowler, a state trooper in Alabama. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=403.87s">This</a>  march also occurred a year and a half after the infamous March on Washington, highlighting that little had changed in the lives of black people in America. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=417.201s">Bloody</a>  Sunday was highlighted in Ava DuVernay's Oscar-nominated best picture film, Selma. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=429.406s">Bloody</a>  Sunday is often noted as a pinnacle of Lewis' life. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=435.508s">Number</a>  one, vote always. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=440.33s">Your</a>  vote matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=441.75s">If</a>  it didn't, why would some people keep trying to take it away from us? <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=450.257s">Hashtag</a>  good trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=452.419s">Lewis</a>  sent this tweet on July 3rd, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=455.061s">It</a>  highlights his work, equitable voting, his life's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=465.369s">One</a>  major part of the Civil Rights Movement was black people gaining the right to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=472.254s">This</a>  finally occurred with the Voting Rights Act of 1965. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=477.931s">But</a>  the Shelby versus Holder Supreme Court decision in 2013 essentially gutted the Voting Rights Act and paved the way for widespread voter suppression and gerrymandering, which we know they hope to do this year as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=498.442s">Similar</a>  forces, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=501.103s">This</a>  is why it is imperative for Congress to act swiftly to pass the John Lewis Voter Rights Advancement Act to ensure equitable access to the polls. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=514.889s">Lewis</a>  was an original freedom fighter, participated in many sit-ins, and was arrested dozens of times for people to have the right to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=525.005s">He</a>  said, some of us gave a little blood for the right to participate in the democratic process. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=535.351s">Some</a>  gave their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=538.773s">Now,</a>  Congress must honor Lewis's legacy and ensure an equitable participation in the democratic process. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=548.899s">As</a>  Lewis noted, the vote is precious. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=552.721s">It</a>  is almost sacred. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=555.14s">It</a>  is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=560.763s">Number</a>  two, you're never too young to make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=566.787s">As</a>  a founder and leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, aka SNCC, Lewis was the youngest person to speak at the march on Washington. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=576.532s">He</a>  was 23 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=579.634s">Elder</a>  civil rights leaders aimed to taper his words <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=584.216s">Lewis</a>  was critical of the Kennedy administration and the slowness by which broad scale legislation change was occurring at the federal level. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=593.841s">Lewis</a>  also critiqued civil rights legislation for not addressing police brutality against black people. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=601.264s">Imagine</a>  how this moment in the movement for black lives may be different had elder civil rights leaders listened to John Lewis. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=612.333s">Lewis</a>  stated, I want to see young people in America feel the spirit of the 1960s and find a way to get in the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=622.776s">Lewis</a>  stated, I want to see, pardon me, to find a way to get into trouble, good trouble, necessary trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=631.559s">Young</a>  people can and should push for transformative change and hold us accountable to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=640.422s">Number</a>  three. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=642.145s">speak</a>  truth to power. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=645.788s">Speak</a>  up. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=647.85s">Speak</a>  out. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=649.691s">Get</a>  in the way, said Lewis. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=653.755s">He</a>  taught us the importance of speaking up and speaking out. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=657.198s">We</a>  have to be willing to speak up about injustice always, no matter what the costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=666.502s">My</a>  grandfather who served in two wars earning a purple heart and a bronze star taught me from birth that silence, my silence, is my acceptance. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=677.646s">Lewis</a>  stated, when you see something that is not right, not fair, not just, you have to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=684.829s">You</a>  have to say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=686.07s">You</a>  have to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=688.131s">This</a>  motto should apply in all aspects of our lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=693.453s">Feel</a>  that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=697.838s">Lewis</a>  epitomizes it and encourages us not to be silent. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=701.339s">After</a>  reading about his life, you know, I feel like I'm not doing enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=710.182s">Lewis</a>  epitomizes it and encourages us to not be silent. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=714.424s">He</a>  was adamant about supporting free speech, but he was also adamant about condemning hate speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=721.606s">I</a>  believe in freedom of speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=724.275s">But</a>  I also believe that we have an obligation to condemn speech that is racist, bigoted, anti-Semitic, or hateful. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=733.563s">Number</a>  four, become a racial equity broker. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=739.188s">Lewis</a>  is the personification of transitioning from a political activist to a politician. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=748.942s">I</a>  frame it as transitioning from a racial equity advocate to a racial equity broker. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=756.907s">A</a>  racial equity advocate speaks up and speaks out, stands in the gap and sits at the table to advocate for people who cannot advocate for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=770.174s">There</a>  is a saying, if you are not at the table, you are on the menu and someone is eating you for lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=779.537s">Shirley</a>  Chisholm said, if they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=790.146s">Lewis</a>  realized that to make transformative change, he had to be at the table and often bring his own chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=796.572s">Once</a>  at the table, he realized that he needed to help draft the documents that got discussed at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=803.166s">This</a>  led him to becoming an elected official and a racial equity broker to alter, deconstruct, and restructure the laws, policies, and procedures, and the rules that inhibit racial equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=817.869s">And</a>  last but not least, number five, never give up. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=825.13s">When</a>  Lewis was elected to Congress in 1986, <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=831.272s">One</a>  of his first bills was the creation of a national museum to chronicle the history and culture and successes of black Americans. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=839.938s">The</a>  culmination of this bill was passed in 2003 and opened in 2016 as the National Museum of African American History and Culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=855.117s">Lewis</a>  taught us persistence. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=858.159s">He</a>  taught us that when a person has transformative ideas, they should not taper those ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=865.004s">Instead,</a>  they should push those ideas until others get on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=871.048s">Simply</a>  because change is slow does not mean change agents have to move slowly towards it. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=880.375s">Lewis</a>  was a lightning bolt for equity, social justice, and social change. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=887.623s">We</a>  must continue his legacy and never forget history, always pursue equity, and let's get in some good trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=897.814s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=959.08s">I</a>  just, just wow, just wow. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=963.142s">So</a>  thank you all three, my dear friends, Beth and Stacy and Bobby, Robert Hayes. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=976.288s">I</a>  stand with you in believing that all three civil rights champions changed the world for the good. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=982.175s">Their</a>  sacrifices are both historic and well-documented. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=986.319s">Sharing</a>  these reflections gives the opportunity to see Martin Luther King Jr.' <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=992.506s">'s</a>  collaborative influence over so many in the movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=998.258s">As</a>  we move forward, I want us to move even more deeply into today's theme and challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=1005.7s">So</a>  if you don't mind indulging the poet in me, I'd like to share a new piece written for just such a time as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=1015.523s">It's</a>  my first time sharing it, and I hope it gets you fired up. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=1020.965s">Please</a>  give this rendition a mindful listen if we don't quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=1029.273s">If</a>  we don't quit, we can protest our plight with the alacrity and tenacity of Medgar and Malcolm and Martin. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=1038.497s">We</a>  can purge our psyches of guilt and shame and isolation like Mandela at Robin Island's release. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=1046.18s">We</a>  can pause the clock on the desecration of our tribes and our villages. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=1050.702s">We</a>  can plow the fields of our ancestors and plant the seeds of the dreams they left us. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=1057.354s">We</a>  can post the news of the fall of our demons and pursue new justice with grace and creativity. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=1063.779s">We</a>  can push back against the ugliness and ignorance of a society drunk again with predatory whiteness. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=1072.359s">We</a>  can plan celebrations with our true allies and propose toasts and salute our heroes. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=1079.867s">We</a>  can promote our culture with righteous pride in the face of our detractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=1084.373s">We</a>  can protect our progeny, our probity, and our dignity with the content of our character. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=1091.16s">We</a>  can peacefully advance against red lines and black codes and institutional systems of oppression. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=1098.367s">We</a>  can purposefully move the wheels of positive change forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=1102.492s">We</a>  can permanently say no

<a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4839.476s">Now,</a>  one of our regulars at the West Medford Community Center's senior lunches is a woman by the name of Dorothy King, or Dottie as we call her. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4850.079s">And</a>  this is her stock and trade. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4852.319s">She</a>  loves a word search. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4853.98s">She</a>  has a word search book with her all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4856.8s">And</a>  that's where I actually got the inspiration for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4860.661s">But</a>  on your word search, <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4864.347s">With</a>  no key, there are 22 words that you are charged with finding. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4870.25s">What's</a>  going to happen is I'm going to call out the word, and each person at the table searches for the word, circles it, and shares what they found with the other people at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4883.935s">The</a>  idea is that the table is <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4888.337s">the</a>  victor, not the individual, the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4892.338s">So</a>  we want to be in community. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4894.779s">If</a>  you find other words before I call out the next one, do the same with your table mates. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4900.101s">Give</a>  them the heads up. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4901.641s">So</a>  in this pursuit, process matters more than results. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4907.303s">Be</a>  community. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4909.104s">Be</a>  helpful and be respectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4911.584s">Don't</a>  start writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4915.228s">OK,</a>  don't start writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4917.809s">Y'all</a>  not following instructions. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4922.292s">All</a>  right, you just launch right in, like you know exactly what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4926.334s">All</a>  right, hold on. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4927.534s">It's</a>  not rocket science. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4929.936s">It's</a>  social science. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4932.057s">And</a>  to keep it moving forward, we want to gain peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4936.359s">We</a>  want to sponsor equality and justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4940.601s">This</a>  is one of the big points of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4944.323s">Peace,</a>  justice, and equality. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4947.325s">We</a>  have to get good at it, and we have to get good at it all over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4953.508s">OK?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4954.189s">So</a>  the first word, struggle. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4956.25s">Go</a>  on and find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4958.151s">Find</a>  it and share it. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4962.133s">OK?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4962.714s">In</a>  community, find it, share it. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4968.157s">Come</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4975.475s">All</a>  right, second word, peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=4978.877s">All</a>  right?

<a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5621.522s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5622.763s">So</a>  he's going to share two pieces of work with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5628.089s">He's</a>  going to share a piece that is absolutely a favorite of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5631.632s">Actually,</a>  one of the first poems I heard, aside from a Phyllis Wheatley poem a long, long time ago, that hit me to the fact that black men wrote poetry. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5641.502s">It's</a>  a Langston Hughes poem. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5644.643s">It's</a>  called Mother to Son. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5647.165s">So</a>  he's going to share that with us, and he's going to share a piece of his own work. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5651.006s">So</a>  ladies and gentlemen, a nice warm round of applause for Max Heinegg.</p>

    <p>[Heinegg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5662.391s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5663.431s">Thank</a>  you for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5665.312s">Mother</a>  to Son by Langston Hughes. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5668.339s">Well,</a>  son, I'll tell you, life for me ain't been no crystal stair. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5674.725s">It's</a>  had tacks in it, and splinters, and boards torn up, and places with no carpet on the floor, bare. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5684.013s">But</a>  all the time I've been climbing on, and reaching landings, and turning corners, and sometimes going in the dark where there ain't been no light. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5693.661s">So,</a>  boy, don't you turn back. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5697.037s">Don't</a>  you set down on the steps, because you'll find it's kind of hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5700.903s">And</a>  don't you fall now, for I'm still going, honey. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5703.648s">I'm</a>  still climbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5705.27s">And</a>  life for me ain't been no crystal stair. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5717.048s">I</a>  wanted to do kind of like a low-key companion piece, just a little bit about how I've been feeling lately about my students who I think are, we're all alive at a difficult time right now, but I think the students, <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5733.372s">have</a>  a lot of challenges, maybe some unique ones, and this is just to let them know that I think we are all here for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5741.397s">So</a>  that was mother to son, this is teacher to student, or in the theme of today, advice to the student who wants to quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5750.703s">And</a>  there'll be two moments where it'll seem obvious that I'm gonna try to get you to say don't quit with me, and I'll probably point at you just like a teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5760.78s">Well,</a>  my student, my charge, I've seen you struggling with the world you've inherited. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5767.683s">I've</a>  seen you trying to find your balance on this shaky ground, trying to swim, drowning in screens, trying to walk with ice on our streets, trying to assert yourself, facing the danger in being who you are, trying to be independent with the expectation of servility and conformity, <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5789.852s">the</a>  greed and damage of a system that is built to keep you powerless and disenfranchised. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5796.135s">So</a>  it is tempting to recede in the shadows, to let others do the work, to wait for someone to stand up for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5805.859s">And</a>  while you're young, you can do it a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5811.102s">But</a>  don't quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5813.443s">Say</a>  it with me now. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5815.125s">Don't</a>  quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5817.168s">As</a>  much as the only life you get to live needs you to be that bravery, we need you to be that bravery. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5827.66s">When</a>  we see someone stand up, <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5830.163s">We</a>  stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5831.625s">When</a>  we hear someone raise their voice in the service of others, we dare to as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5838.291s">The</a>  country that needs to awaken and remember its identity and its promise to be a human family needs you. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5848.08s">Each</a>  struggle is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5850.363s">Yeah,</a>  each struggle is real, but I am here for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5855.405s">We</a>  are here for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5857.466s">We</a>  will be your support beams. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5860.308s">So</a>  don't quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5862.208s">I've</a>  got you, and I'm sure you've got me. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5865.45s">Trust</a>  me on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5867.111s">Don't</a>  quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5868.731s">Say</a>  it with me now. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5869.572s">Don't</a>  quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5871.973s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5883.735s">Max</a>  understood the assignment clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5887.317s">All</a>  right, Max, thank you once again for your impassioned artistry. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5890.879s">We're</a>  so happy to have you here with us today, and we appreciate your willingness to join the folks from West Medford at a time when minds and hearts really need to work together across neighborhood lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5904.125s">And</a>  if I imbibed, man, I'm telling you, I'd be down at Medford Brewing Company a little bit later on today trying to get one of those IPAs. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5914.463s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5918.879s">You</a>  may have noticed that today's program has showcased the talents of some wonderful women. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5925.941s">That's</a>  not an accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5927.782s">Dr.</a>  King was blessed with tremendous relationships with great women who dynamically impacted his work in civil rights and social justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5937.745s">I</a>  think the West Medford Community Center has been an incubator of more talented and inspiring women than I can easily recall. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5945.99s">I</a>  always want to be mindful of such important role models and contributors. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5951.994s">On</a>  to the next order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5955.252s">It's</a>  always a challenge to come up with meaningful messages in a keynote address and to charge to a keynote speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5964.639s">And</a>  trust me on this, because I've been on both the giving and the receiving end. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5970.403s">Still,</a>  this for me was an easy and obvious choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5975.747s">The</a>  only concern that I had was availability. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5979.51s">And</a>  that problem worked itself out fairly easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5983.26s">And</a>  relationships always help in these matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5987.657s">Dr.</a>  Sarah Bleich is the inaugural vice provost for special projects at Harvard University. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5994.703s">One</a>  of those special projects is the Harvard Legacy of Slavery Initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=5999.928s">Dr.</a>  Bleich is also a professor of public health policy at the Harvard T.H. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6005.112s">Chan</a>  School of Public Health and a faculty member at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6011.237s">With</a>  more than 190 peer-reviewed publications, she is a policy expert in research who specializes in diet-related diseases, food insecurity, and racial inequality. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6025.069s">Prior</a>  to this, Dr. Bleich served in the Biden administration as the Director of Nutrition Security and Health Equity at the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6033.477s">Department</a>  of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6037.5s">and</a>  as the senior advisor for COVID-19 in the office of the secretary at USDA. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6044.885s">As</a>  a White House fellow during the Obama administration, she worked at USDA as a senior policy advisor for food, nutrition, and consumer services, and on First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6060.915s">Dr.</a>  Bleich was elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2023 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6072.207s">She</a>  holds a B.A. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6073.849s">in</a>  Psychology from Columbia and a Ph.D. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6077.292s">in</a>  Health Policy from Harvard. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6080.016s">I</a>  had the pleasure of hearing Dr. Blythe speak in 2025 when she was celebrating the commencement of a number of Harvard University Administrative Fellows program graduates. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6092.273s">My</a>  wife, Teresa, was among those graduates. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6095.778s">Needless</a>  to say, I was thrilled to be in that audience of friends, family, and supporters. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6101.059s">But</a>  beyond this, I was excited to hear the speech of this mentor and scholar and all that she would have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6112.202s">When</a>  I heard and what I heard then brings me to this moment in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6117.843s">Soon,</a>  you too will know why I was on a mission to bring Dr. Bleich here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6123.986s">Without</a>  further ado, it's my pleasure to present Dr. Sarah Naomi Bleich.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6140.296s">Good</a>  afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6141.278s">I</a>  was saying to Robert, so I've been in and out of this area for about 20 years, and this is by far the kindest place I have been in all those 20 years, so just thank you for welcoming me. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6157.668s">And</a>  thank you to Terry and his wife, Teresa, for inviting me to be here with you for this Martin Luther King Day celebration. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6165.398s">I</a>  also want to thank the Tufts University Office of Government and Community Relations. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6169.763s">It</a>  really is a pleasure to be with you all, to be in this space, and to be in community. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6176.211s">As</a>  you heard from Terry, my name is Dr. Sarah Bleich, and I have a couple of different hats. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6182.074s">I'm</a>  on the faculty at the School of Public Health at Harvard in the Kennedy School and still do academic research. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6187.596s">And</a>  I also have this Administrator hat where I am a vice provost and lead our Legacy of Slavery initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6195.54s">And</a>  in our time today, I want to reflect on the words and wisdom of Dr. Martin Luther King, to share some of the work that we are doing at Harvard, and most importantly, to connect on the theme of this year's celebration, if we don't quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6214.796s">But</a>  before I do that, I wanna begin by acknowledging several individuals whose lives, labor, and leadership anchor us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6224.859s">So</a>  earlier, about an hour ago, we posthumously honored Mr. Clarence Ed Ligon for civic engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6233.702s">We</a>  also honored Miss Adele Chavezano for her commitment and impact to arts and culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6240.57s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6240.81s">Stacey</a>  Clayton for her faith in action, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6245.053s">Gwendolyn</a>  Lee for her enduring legacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6248.996s">Mr.</a>  Ligon, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6250.137s">Travisano,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6251.598s">Clayton,</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6252.499s">Lee,</a>  we thank you all again because Medford wouldn't be what it is today without your tireless dedication and commitment to preserving the history of this city and working together to ensure that it remains strong, daring not to quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6270.512s">Please</a>  join me once again in congratulating them. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6281.445s">I</a>  would also like to reflect back and to acknowledge someone who lived and labored in this very city hundreds of years ago, not even a mile from where we're sitting right now, Miss Belinda Sutton. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6295.614s">Miss</a>  Belinda Sutton was an African woman enslaved at the royal house in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6301.718s">Now,</a>  me and my team went and visited the Royal House around this time last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6306.261s">It</a>  was winter moving into spring, and two things stood out to me on that visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6313.025s">One</a>  was when we were upstairs in the bedrooms, one of the things that Dr. Keira Singleton, who's the executive director, explained to us is that enslaved women would sleep on the feet of their enslavers to keep them warm. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6329.347s">And</a>  it was a really cold day that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6331.888s">So</a>  I'm fully dressed, my feet are kind of cold, and I'm imagining sleeping on the feet of someone else to keep their feet warm while my feet are freezing. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6343.815s">The</a>  second thing that really stuck with me on that visit was going downstairs into the kitchen area. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6350.379s">And</a>  there was this very fancy equivalent of a spit for making meat. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6355.902s">And</a>  she explained that the reason that the house had made this really big investment in this spit was because the number one cause of death for women was being burned to death by their undergarments and their clothes being set on fire from the flame. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6372.802s">But</a>  the purpose of that spit was not to protect and care for the enslaved. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6378.825s">The</a>  purpose of that spit was to make sure that the property of the enslavers didn't die. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6385.147s">And</a>  I just think about those moments, and it's just, it's amazing the history of this country, and bless you, and the Royal House and Slave Quarters literally is not even a mile away from here. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6398.233s">So</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6398.653s">Sutton</a>  survived the Middle Passage, years of forced labor at the royal estate, the abandonment of her enslaver during the American Revolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6407.838s">And</a>  in 1783, she did something extraordinary. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6412.481s">She</a>  petitioned the Massachusetts legislature for a pension from the estate that had profited from her enslavement. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6420.665s">Her</a>  petition was approved, and one payment was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6425.628s">But</a>  then she had many, many efforts to request the rest of the money she was owed and was unsuccessful. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6432.573s">But</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6433.274s">Sutton</a>  never stopped trying. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6436.716s">This</a>  is one of the earliest documented accounts of an African woman in America plagued by slavery's chains, daring not to quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6447.481s">And</a>  of course, we honor the reason that we are all here today, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a man who held many titles for those that were close to him, a son, a husband, a father, a friend, a minister. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6462.792s">For</a>  the rest of us, he was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement, beginning when he was just in his 20s. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6469.895s">Dr.</a>  King followed his grandfather and his father's footsteps, became a pastor, and preached his first sermon as a teenager in Ebenezer Baptist Church, nurturing his gift of moving and inspiring millions through public speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6486.093s">Dr.</a>  King was a man who saw what the future could be if people came together and stood up for what is right, for what is just, and what is true, daring not to quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6499.656s">Today's</a>  theme, If We Don't Quit, could be the subtitle of Dr. King's legacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6506.338s">In</a>  a powerful speech at Spelman College in 1960, he said, and this is on the crossword search that we just did, if you can't fly, <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6516.0s">then</a>  run. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6517.361s">If</a>  you can't run, then walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6520.482s">And</a>  if you can't walk, then crawl. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6524.083s">But</a>  whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6529.146s">And</a>  move forward we must and we will. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6532.987s">Dr.</a>  King's words are a powerful reminder of the importance of perseverance for progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6539.529s">And</a>  they are not just something that makes us feel inspired today. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6543.33s">They</a>  are a strategy for tomorrow and something that I hold as I move forward in the implementation work around Harvard's Legacy of Slavery initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6553.932s">Now,</a>  I come at the legacy of slavery work with a public health lens. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6558.536s">For</a>  the past two decades, I have dedicated my career to building evidence for policies to help communities live longer, healthier lives through academic research and translation. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6569.066s">I've</a>  also, as you heard from Terry, had the opportunity to serve twice in the federal government, first under the Obama administration and then in the Biden administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6579.355s">But</a>  my commitment to historically underserved communities is deeply personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6584.617s">So</a>  I grew up in inner city Baltimore, and I was just telling Robert before we started that walking into this room is the first time I have felt like I am in Baltimore in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6597.241s">And</a>  that is because of the kindness of this room, and you really are to be commended for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6607.807s">Now,</a>  growing up, I had my parents, and then I have a twin sister, who is my heart, and an older brother, and my parents were both public school teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6616.489s">And</a>  my mom did special ed, my dad did high school English. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6619.69s">I</a>  can't go anywhere to this day in Baltimore with my father without someone saying, Mr. Bleich, Mr. Bleich. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6625.012s">He</a>  knows everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6626.412s">The</a>  other thing he did is that for the last part of his teaching career, he taught English <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6633.014s">at</a>  an engineering high school, the top engineering high school in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6637.398s">So</a>  you had to get through my dad to graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6640.241s">And</a>  so there is a lot of folklore about these engineering students learning how to write well because my dad insisted on excellence in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6649.131s">Now,</a>  because my parents were public school teachers and because my mom stepped back from the workforce when we were young, my family received SNAP, which you may know as food stamps. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6660.018s">My</a>  family received WIC. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6662.12s">And</a>  me and my siblings, we received school meals. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6665.062s">So</a>  I know firsthand the difference that those programs can make. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6669.325s">So</a>  it has been a pleasure and honor of my career to be able to explore how do you strengthen the public health impacts of federal nutrition assistance programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6679.071s">And</a>  because I know how powerful these programs are, personally and professionally, this current moment that we are in is especially painful. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6688.736s">As</a>  many of you know, federal nutrition policy has undergone some of the steepest rollbacks in decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6696.419s">So</a>  last year, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or HR1, was passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6703.262s">It</a>  does many things, including reduces federal spending on SNAP by $186 billion. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6713.155s">That</a>  is the steepest cut in the history of the program, and it's about 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6719.343s">That</a>  means that millions and millions of people are not going to be able to participate in that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6726.489s">Now,</a>  these harms are going to be compounded by the cuts through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to Medicaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6733.814s">A</a>  trillion dollars over 10 years means 10 million people are going to lose benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6740.399s">Many</a>  people who participate in Medicaid also participate in SNAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6745.324s">So</a>  families are facing collateral impacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6749.047s">These</a>  are likely friends, family, people that you know well, but these changes are going to affect real people in real ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6757.075s">And</a>  in moments like these, it can be hard to know where to lean in. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6761.919s">And</a>  when I feel that way, I return to my North Star, helping underserved communities achieve a better quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6769.327s">And</a>  in this season of change, that is my way of daring not to quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6776.175s">Now,</a>  my work in public health was a launchpad for doing the implementation work for Harvard Legacy of Slavery Initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6784.229s">But</a>  there's also a very personal moment that primed me for this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6789.413s">So</a>  in 2017, on this day, on MLK, MLK celebration, I was at the JFK Library with my girls. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6799.06s">They</a>  were then four and six or five and seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6803.463s">And</a>  the focus of that day was the soundtrack to MLK's life. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6809.287s">So</a>  the MC is describing one of the songs, it was a spiritual, and he mentions slavery. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6815.792s">My</a>  then seven-year-old child, my oldest, turns to me and says, Mama, what's slavery? <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6822.297s">Now</a>  before I tell you what I said, I come from a family where manners and kindness are everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6829.582s">So</a>  if you're inconsiderate, if you are mean to someone else, you will get in a world of trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6835.266s">It</a>  is a value that my parents have loudly instilled in myself and my siblings and to my children and one that I really try to reinforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6845.39s">So</a>  I turn to my seven-year-old who says to me, Mama, what's slavery? <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6849.092s">And</a>  I explain it using seven-year-old terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6853.415s">She</a>  might have been six, I can't remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6854.916s">And</a>  I just, I watch, literally watch the wheels turning in her head. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6859.419s">And</a>  she looks at me and she said, Mama, that was rude. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6864.968s">And</a>  I said, you know what, honey? <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6866.548s">It</a>  was extremely rude. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6868.589s">And</a>  for her, that was like a four-letter word. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6871.73s">Because</a>  again, we were told you can't be inconsiderate, you can't be rude. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6876.271s">And</a>  so I often think about that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6880.031s">She</a>  had such moral clarity so quickly about what slavery was. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6886.073s">It</a>  was profoundly wrong, and it was deeply disrespectful to human dignity. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6892.705s">So</a>  in 2022, Harvard released a report detailing the university's direct financial and intellectual ties to slavery, along with seven recommendations for how to advance reparative efforts related to that history. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6907.897s">And</a>  the report taught us three difficult truths. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6911.56s">The</a>  first, Harvard has direct ties to slavery. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6915.824s">Harvard</a>  leaders, Harvard faculty, Harvard staff, enslaved people in Massachusetts and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6922.549s">Harvard</a>  has financial ties to slavery. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6925.551s">The</a>  university benefited from donors and investments rooted in the slave economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6931.394s">And</a>  the third is that Harvard has intellectual ties to slavery. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6935.576s">Harvard</a>  scholars helped build and legitimize the racist ideas that justified slavery and segregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6942.62s">If</a>  you're interested to read the report, I've brought a bunch of copies with me that you're welcome to take, and it's also freely available online if you want to learn more. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6951.162s">One</a>  important thing to know is that the report was voluntary. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6955.043s">No</a>  one forced Harvard to look in the mirror, but as Dr. King taught us, the time is always right to do what is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6965.225s">The</a>  university is nearly 400 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6968.626s">It</a>  was past time to be honest about its history. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6973.448s">In</a>  response, Harvard created the Legacy of Slavery Initiative with a $100 million endowment to cast light on the university's legacies of slavery and address the enduring consequences of slavery through purposeful change. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6988.618s">And</a>  I was asked to lead this work in 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6992.441s">At</a>  the initiative, we have three main priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=6996.323s">One</a>  is memorializing those who were enslaved by Harvard affiliates while educating the community on the university's ties to slavery. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7005.187s">Another</a>  is strengthening partnerships with historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7010.65s">And</a>  the third is identifying direct descendants of those enslaved by Harvard affiliates. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7016.653s">To</a>  me, the work that we are doing today is a way to honor Dr. King's legacy and many other leaders like him, like many of you in this room, who have dedicated your lives to addressing legacies of slavery and their impact on communities, never giving up and daring not to quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7037.554s">In</a>  1962, Dr. King came to Harvard Law School, and he gave a talk, and it was called The Future of Integration. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7045.621s">He</a>  told the audience that to have an integrated society, we can do one of three things. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7051.665s">We</a>  can observe the state of our world today and live in extreme optimism, which calls us to do nothing, always thinking the best while ignoring some painful realities of what's going on around us. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7066.397s">Or,</a>  we can observe the state of our world today and live in extreme pessimism, which calls on us to digress, see all the problems, create more problems, while solving zero problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7081.369s">or</a>  we can observe the state of our world today and combine the truths of extreme optimism and extreme pessimism and be thankful for how far we have come while understanding that we have a long way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7098.578s">And</a>  here we are, 64 years later, living in a reality that reflects much of the sociopolitical environment during Dr. King's time while also demonstrating progress <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7111.385s">Yet,</a>  we have a long way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7112.868s">And</a>  we can only get there together if we dare not to quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7119.93s">At</a>  Harvard, we're not quitting and remain committed to the implementation work at the Harvard Legacy of Slavery Initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7127.056s">Some</a>  of the ways we live out this commitment are providing individuals and groups with an introduction to what slavery looked like in the 17th, 18th, and 19th century New England, and how Harvard played a major role in it through our guided and self-guided tour experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7143.348s">We</a>  would love to welcome you all on a guided tour this spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7146.77s">Feel</a>  free to reach out and we can set that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7149.031s">Or</a>  the self-guided option is always available and you can take it at any time that's convenient for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7154.414s">Many</a>  who participate in these tours are stunned that this history is in our backyard and that slavery wasn't something that only happened in the South. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7165.94s">Another</a>  way Harvard lives out its commitment is through partnerships with HBCUs. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7171.443s">For</a>  example, we are currently in the third year of offering a program called the Du Bois Scholars Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7176.685s">It's</a>  a summer research internship for rising juniors and seniors at research-intensive HBCUs. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7182.387s">We</a>  partner with 21 different institutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7185.289s">And</a>  past participants have impacted Harvard through planting seeds that inspire further research by Harvard faculty members, <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7193.512s">And</a>  I'm proud that Harvard gets to help participants to deepen their research skills and develop a strong network of peers through their involvement with the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7202.914s">This</a>  past fall, I had a focus group with a number of the faculty that participated. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7208.296s">And</a>  one of them, who's been a faculty member for the past two summers, said that in his 26 years of being on the faculty at Harvard Medical School, being a mentor in this program is the most rewarding thing that he's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7223.479s">And</a>  I think we at Harvard are so privileged to have these amazing fellows from HBCUs come with their confidence, with their brilliance, with their energy, with their excitement, and honestly make Harvard a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7237.186s">So</a>  this is a space where we're probably gaining more than we're giving. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7241.428s">The</a>  last example I'll leave you with is that we're currently working alongside an organization called American Ancestors. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7248.233s">They</a>  are the oldest genealogical organization in the country, and we're working with them to identify Harvard leaders, Harvard faculty and staff who enslaved people, and the descendants of those who were enslaved. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7261.263s">Although</a>  it will take multiple years to complete, this work is vital and Harvard remains committed. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7267.348s">And</a>  if you want to learn more about the implementation work, I've brought along some one-pagers which describe it and there are QR codes in there that you can scan to learn about things in more detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7278.41s">During</a>  times when this work and the values that it represents are being questioned, Dr. King's legacy continually inspires me to keep leading my team to take concrete steps toward Harvard reckoning with the enduring consequences of slavery. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7295.697s">The</a>  work that we do has real impact on real lives, and we can only do it in community with others. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7304.92s">If</a>  we don't quit on amplifying history, even when that history is painful. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7312.106s">If</a>  we don't quit on investing in our communities through civic engagement, arts and culture, faith in action, and legacy building. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7321.413s">If</a>  we don't quit on building institutions that are accountable, not just prestigious, if we don't quit on each other across every line of difference, then the work of Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7335.616s">Belinda</a>  Sutton with her petition, the work Dr. King carried through the Civil Rights Movement, and the work that all of you are doing here in Medford will continue to move us towards a more just society. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7349.479s">And</a>  even when it feels like we're swimming upstream, which is how this moment feels to me, we will make progress and eventually draw closer to the promised land. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7359.971s">We</a>  cannot quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7363.134s">Let</a>  me close with a simple invitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7366.758s">Dare</a>  not to quit on yourself, on what you built, on what your community built, or on one another. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7374.805s">We</a>  need each other to build a brighter future in which generations can thrive and in turn help light the way for those who follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7385.234s">Thank</a>  you for having me in your space.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7409.934s">So</a>  I'm smiling from ear to ear, because as you probably do, I love it when a plan comes together. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7420.059s">What</a>  I heard then. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7423.25s">is</a>  equivalent in so many ways to what I heard today. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7429.211s">Sarah,</a>  that was absolutely amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7432.552s">And</a>  you crystallized everything that we wanted to bring to our audience today. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7439.593s">And</a>  I want you all to give yourselves a round of applause, because you've been a great audience in braving the elements to join us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7454.743s">So</a>  as we move closer to the close of our program, I would be remiss in this gathering, and I don't think it would be complete if we didn't link arms and sing together. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7468.767s">Martin</a>  Luther King was a great lover of the gospel, but also of gospel music. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7475.709s">And</a>  here to present us in another of Dr. King's favorite spirituals, We Shall Overcome, is once again the wonderful Athene Wilson.</p>

    <p>[w2qazGPKqcY_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7767.982s">Hello?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7769.184s">Hello?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7769.644s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7769.805s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7771.728s">Thank</a>  you, Terry. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7776.635s">The</a>  charge for this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7779.918s">So</a>  I believe you all came here today because you care about the things that Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7786.822s">cared</a>  about throughout his historic and courageous life. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7791.785s">You</a>  care about people, your family, your friends, your neighbors, even those who you do not know personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7800.629s">You</a>  believe that each and every person has rights that should not be infringed upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7806.978s">equal</a>  protection under the law, voting rights, equity and access in housing, employment, education, and health care. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7816.406s">These</a>  are all the things that you care about and believe in. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7820.958s">Hopefully</a>  throughout our time together, you were able to soak in and absorb the messages of our speakers, that you engaged in fruitful conversations with your neighbors and table mates, and that you were present for the last few hours, taking a pause and respite from the encompassing chaos that somehow has become our new normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7846.038s">I've</a>  been asked to reshape the positive and communal energy of our time together into a charge for moving forward as one, as one beloved community. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7859.611s">I'm</a>  honored and humbled to do so, but I am resolute about making the best of the few moments I have to share something of value as we leave today's proceedings. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7873.183s">There</a>  are three key principles I believe Dr. King would have wanted us to focus on at this difficult, challenging, and what feels like backwards-moving time. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7885.548s">First,</a>  I believe that Dr. King would have beseeched us to look inward, to engage in self-awareness and acknowledge the role each and every one of us hold in perpetuating injustice. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7899.614s">We</a>  each play a part in upholding oppressive systems and understanding where we are situated is key. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7907.955s">Second,</a>  I think that Dr. King would have reminded us that the challenges and setbacks to progress are part of the normal process of development and not to be discouraged or hopeless. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7922.118s">He</a>  told us that the line of progress is never straight for a period of movement may follow a straight line and then it encounters obstacles and the path bends. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7935.928s">This</a>  means that we cannot lose faith when we face setbacks in seeking peace and equity for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7942.872s">And</a>  lastly, Dr. King would have wanted us to recognize that the path forward is choosing community. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7950.737s">In</a>  his final book before his assassination, Where Do We Go From Here? <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7955.28s">Choosing</a>  Community Over Chaos, it is evident that choosing community and love for one another is the only way forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7964.525s">So</a>  your charge beyond this afternoon, when you leave here today, is threefold. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7969.75s">First,</a>  start to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7974.814s">Leaning</a>  into self-reflection and intentionally seeking to learn about yourself and others, being culture, religion, anyone who's different from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7985.823s">It</a>  can be difficult and it can be uncomfortable, but you need to lean into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=7991.635s">Real</a>  engagement and relationship building humanizes people, and it helps us to see that individuals have much more in common despite noted differences. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8003.168s">I</a>  encourage each of you to make an effort to talk to your neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8008.033s">Get</a>  to know people who live near you if you don't know them already. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8014.136s">Strike</a>  up a conversation with a stranger, in a coffee shop, at the grocery store, at a park, or just while you're waiting by the bus, because you know the buses be late. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8025.739s">But</a>  human-to-human interaction goes a long way, and it often has a trickle-down effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8032.481s">You</a>  don't know how a simple hello or a smile can positively impact someone's day. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8042.196s">Let</a>  go of despair and allow your faith to lead you. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8047.501s">King</a>  said, a final victory is an accumulation of many short-term encounters. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8055.408s">And</a>  right now, we are in the midst of a counter-revolution to the progress we've made in this country in advancing human and civil rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8064.517s">And</a>  we are moving through that cyclical process of progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8069.426s">It's</a>  much easier to give in and buckle under the pressure, but I implore you to dig deep and tap into your faith and encourage others to do so as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8081.592s">Whatever</a>  notion of the divine might be for you as an individual and for your neighbors, tap into it and keep it at the forefront of all that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8093.003s">And</a>  finally, choose community over chaos. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8097.304s">Do</a>  what is necessary to ensure that every individual, despite their race, sex, gender identity, religion, socioeconomic status, any differing characteristic, that every single individual has what they need to thrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8114.629s">That</a>  is at the core of what equity is. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8118.281s">actively</a>  choose to prioritize equity, which requires a commitment to understanding that the structures and systems we currently have perpetuate disparities in every facet of life and that they must change. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8133.699s">And</a>  accepting that change will be hard, it's okay to make that choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8140.068s">In</a>  all that you do, consider how it will impact not just you, but others, your family, your friends, your neighbors, and those you do not know and might not ever meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8152.005s">As</a>  we depart here today, let's be mindful of our duty to live out the promise of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.' <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8159.792s">'s</a>  sacred trust and his willing sacrifice. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8163.855s">Gathering</a>  together our individual pieces of his dream can lead to something truly special, or as Dr. King so eloquently stated, not everybody can be famous, but everybody can be great, because greatness is determined by service. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8180.689s">Thank</a>  you all for being here today, and I hope that you leave here reinvigorated, determined to serve, and remembering not to quit.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8209.002s">Wow,</a>  wow. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8213.143s">Well,</a>  Medford, that's a good day's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8217.484s">We've</a>  discussed, we've dined, we've danced, we've sang, we've listened, and we've learned. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8224.165s">I</a>  believe it's exactly what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8228.126s">wanted</a>  in us as we are together today. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8231.907s">I</a>  pray that there's no COVID, no conflict, and no lack of commitment in the room, even as we're leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/55_y5dUe6B4&t=8239.793s">So</a>  as things wrap up, I'm going to cede the floor to Lisa M.
