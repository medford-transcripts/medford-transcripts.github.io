1
00:00:00,531 --> 00:00:04,252
[SPEAKER_12]: for decades, decades, decades, decades.

2
00:00:05,292 --> 00:00:21,396
[SPEAKER_12]: Even before finishing her doctorate, she was conducting independent research at the University of Chicago's Marine Biological Laboratory, studying how cells respond to ultraviolet light, hormones, and experimental drugs.

3
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:27,458
[SPEAKER_12]: These were early steps towards understanding melanoma at the cellular level.

4
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:37,154
[SPEAKER_12]: After graduation, she joined Harlem Hospital Cancer Research Foundation, working alongside Dr. Jane C. Wright.

5
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:50,502
[SPEAKER_12]: There, Jewel mastered human tissue culture, growing real cancer cells from patient biopsies so drugs could be tested before reaching human bodies.

6
00:00:52,523 --> 00:00:55,765
[SPEAKER_12]: It changed cancer treatment forever.

7
00:00:57,408 --> 00:01:02,210
[SPEAKER_12]: It changed cancer treatment forever.

8
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:08,613
[SPEAKER_12]: It changed cancer treatment forever.

9
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:18,557
[SPEAKER_12]: At just 28, Jewel found her own tissue culture lab at the University of Illinois College of Medicine.

10
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,596
[SPEAKER_12]: a black woman leading independent cancer research in the 1950s.

11
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:38,869
[SPEAKER_12]: While the funding committees doubted her competence and colleagues questioned her data and journals fought to minimize her authorship, Jewel, she persisted anyway.

12
00:01:40,693 --> 00:01:55,841
[SPEAKER_12]: Her melanoma research revealed how melanin protects cells from UV damage and how cancer cells fundamentally differ from healthy ones, finding that became cornerstones of modern skin cancer science.

13
00:01:57,782 --> 00:02:03,565
[SPEAKER_12]: That became cornerstones of modern skin cancer science.

14
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Then came the work that saved lives.

15
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:18,471
[SPEAKER_12]: In the early 1960s, Juul helped demonstrate the power of methotrexate against skin cancer, lung cancer, and childhood leukemia.

16
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:25,834
[SPEAKER_12]: Research that helped establish one of the most important chemotherapy drugs in medical history.

17
00:02:27,395 --> 00:02:33,217
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the most important chemotherapy medical drugs in history.

18
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,303
[SPEAKER_12]: a drug still used today and saving lives.

19
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:41,328
[SPEAKER_12]: But Jewel never forgot the hallway at NYU.

20
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,797
[SPEAKER_12]: She understood that brilliance means nothing if access is denied.

21
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:53,713
[SPEAKER_12]: So she turned her attention to opening doors.

22
00:02:54,734 --> 00:03:09,520
[SPEAKER_12]: She became a college dean, then earned a second deanship, and in 1981, she broke yet another barrier as the first African American woman president of California State University, Fullerton.

23
00:03:11,751 --> 00:03:25,035
[SPEAKER_12]: There she built scholarships, tutoring programs, and research opportunities for students who had been told, just as she once was, that they did not belong in science.

24
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:31,557
[SPEAKER_12]: When she retired, she kept mentoring, kept advising, and kept lifting.

25
00:03:34,988 --> 00:03:43,492
[SPEAKER_12]: When Dr. Jewel Plummer Cobb died in 2017 at the age of 92, she left behind more than discoveries.

26
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:57,299
[SPEAKER_12]: She left behind lives saved, institutions transformed, and generations of scientists who never had to stand alone in a hallway and demand to be seen.

27
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,988
[SPEAKER_12]: She was denied entry because of the color of her skin.

28
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:05,450
[SPEAKER_12]: She showed up anyway.

29
00:04:07,052 --> 00:04:09,574
[SPEAKER_12]: She showed up anyway.

30
00:04:10,715 --> 00:04:15,279
[SPEAKER_12]: And by refusing to accept a closed door, she changed science.

31
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,083
[SPEAKER_12]: And who gets to belong in it forever?

32
00:04:39,318 --> 00:04:39,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning.

33
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:46,841
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems the spirit of the 60s has returned in every way.

34
00:04:50,303 --> 00:05:08,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Remembering John Lewis, on July 23rd, 2020, Mr. Ray Sean Ray of the renowned Brookings Institute shared this reflection on the late US Congressman

35
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:21,024
[SPEAKER_06]: John Lewis, titled, Five Things John Lewis Taught Us About Getting In Good Trouble.

36
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:24,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Indeed, yes, indeed.

37
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:36,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and redeem the soul of America.

38
00:05:38,722 --> 00:05:53,768
[SPEAKER_06]: John Lewis made this statement on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama on March 1st, 2020 commemorating the tragic events of Bloody Sunday.

39
00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:04,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Bloody Sunday occurred on March 7th, 1965 as peaceful protesters were beaten by law enforcement

40
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:11,173
[SPEAKER_06]: something we're too familiar with these days, for crossing the bridge.

41
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:18,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Lewis and others, like Amelia Boynton Robinson, were beaten so badly they were hospitalized.

42
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:22,359
[SPEAKER_06]: The context behind the march is significant.

43
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:28,722
[SPEAKER_06]: The 600-person civil rights march was actually about police brutality.

44
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:41,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Jimmy Lee Jackson, a 26-year-old church deacon, was killed by James Barnard Fowler, a state trooper in Alabama.

45
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:54,095
[SPEAKER_06]: This march also occurred a year and a half after the infamous March on Washington, highlighting that little had changed in the lives of black people in America.

46
00:06:57,201 --> 00:07:05,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Bloody Sunday was highlighted in Ava DuVernay's Oscar-nominated best picture film, Selma.

47
00:07:09,406 --> 00:07:13,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Bloody Sunday is often noted as a pinnacle of Lewis' life.

48
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:18,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, vote always.

49
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Your vote matters.

50
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,032
[SPEAKER_06]: If it didn't, why would some people keep trying to take it away from us?

51
00:07:30,257 --> 00:07:31,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Hashtag good trouble.

52
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Lewis sent this tweet on July 3rd, 2018.

53
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:42,787
[SPEAKER_06]: It highlights his work, equitable voting, his life's work.

54
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:50,873
[SPEAKER_06]: One major part of the Civil Rights Movement was black people gaining the right to vote.

55
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:54,316
[SPEAKER_06]: This finally occurred with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

56
00:07:57,931 --> 00:08:16,237
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Shelby versus Holder Supreme Court decision in 2013 essentially gutted the Voting Rights Act and paved the way for widespread voter suppression and gerrymandering, which we know they hope to do this year as well.

57
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:20,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Similar forces, of course.

58
00:08:21,103 --> 00:08:33,109
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why it is imperative for Congress to act swiftly to pass the John Lewis Voter Rights Advancement Act to ensure equitable access to the polls.

59
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:43,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Lewis was an original freedom fighter, participated in many sit-ins, and was arrested dozens of times for people to have the right to vote.

60
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:51,989
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, some of us gave a little blood for the right to participate in the democratic process.

61
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:56,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Some gave their lives.

62
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:07,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Congress must honor Lewis's legacy and ensure an equitable participation in the democratic process.

63
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:11,700
[SPEAKER_06]: As Lewis noted, the vote is precious.

64
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:14,102
[SPEAKER_06]: It is almost sacred.

65
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,162
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democracy.

66
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:25,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, you're never too young to make a difference.

67
00:09:26,787 --> 00:09:36,272
[SPEAKER_06]: As a founder and leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, aka SNCC, Lewis was the youngest person to speak at the march on Washington.

68
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:37,553
[SPEAKER_06]: He was 23 years old.

69
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:42,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Elder civil rights leaders aimed to taper his words

70
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:52,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Lewis was critical of the Kennedy administration and the slowness by which broad scale legislation change was occurring at the federal level.

71
00:09:53,841 --> 00:10:00,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Lewis also critiqued civil rights legislation for not addressing police brutality against black people.

72
00:10:01,264 --> 00:10:10,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine how this moment in the movement for black lives may be different had elder civil rights leaders listened to John Lewis.

73
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:20,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Lewis stated, I want to see young people in America feel the spirit of the 1960s and find a way to get in the way.

74
00:10:22,776 --> 00:10:29,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Lewis stated, I want to see, pardon me, to find a way to get into trouble, good trouble, necessary trouble.

75
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:37,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Young people can and should push for transformative change and hold us accountable to it.

76
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:40,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Number three.

77
00:10:42,145 --> 00:10:44,447
[SPEAKER_06]: speak truth to power.

78
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:46,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Speak up.

79
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Speak out.

80
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Get in the way, said Lewis.

81
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:56,557
[SPEAKER_06]: He taught us the importance of speaking up and speaking out.

82
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:03,263
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to be willing to speak up about injustice always, no matter what the costs.

83
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:16,266
[SPEAKER_06]: My grandfather who served in two wars earning a purple heart and a bronze star taught me from birth that silence, my silence, is my acceptance.

84
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:23,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Lewis stated, when you see something that is not right, not fair, not just, you have to speak up.

85
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:25,870
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to say something.

86
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,650
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to do something.

87
00:11:28,131 --> 00:11:30,652
[SPEAKER_06]: This motto should apply in all aspects of our lives.

88
00:11:33,453 --> 00:11:34,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Feel that one.

89
00:11:37,838 --> 00:11:41,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Lewis epitomizes it and encourages us not to be silent.

90
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:46,221
[SPEAKER_06]: After reading about his life, you know, I feel like I'm not doing enough.

91
00:11:50,182 --> 00:11:53,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Lewis epitomizes it and encourages us to not be silent.

92
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:59,786
[SPEAKER_06]: He was adamant about supporting free speech, but he was also adamant about condemning hate speech.

93
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:02,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe in freedom of speech.

94
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:11,482
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also believe that we have an obligation to condemn speech that is racist, bigoted, anti-Semitic, or hateful.

95
00:12:13,563 --> 00:12:17,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Number four, become a racial equity broker.

96
00:12:19,188 --> 00:12:26,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Lewis is the personification of transitioning from a political activist to a politician.

97
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:35,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I frame it as transitioning from a racial equity advocate to a racial equity broker.

98
00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:46,832
[SPEAKER_06]: A racial equity advocate speaks up and speaks out, stands in the gap and sits at the table to advocate for people who cannot advocate for themselves.

99
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:56,458
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a saying, if you are not at the table, you are on the menu and someone is eating you for lunch.

100
00:12:59,537 --> 00:13:05,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Shirley Chisholm said, if they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.

101
00:13:10,146 --> 00:13:15,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Lewis realized that to make transformative change, he had to be at the table and often bring his own chair.

102
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:21,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Once at the table, he realized that he needed to help draft the documents that got discussed at the table.

103
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:36,829
[SPEAKER_06]: This led him to becoming an elected official and a racial equity broker to alter, deconstruct, and restructure the laws, policies, and procedures, and the rules that inhibit racial equity.

104
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:42,590
[SPEAKER_06]: And last but not least, number five, never give up.

105
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,511
[SPEAKER_06]: When Lewis was elected to Congress in 1986,

106
00:13:51,272 --> 00:13:58,417
[SPEAKER_06]: One of his first bills was the creation of a national museum to chronicle the history and culture and successes of black Americans.

107
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:08,183
[SPEAKER_06]: The culmination of this bill was passed in 2003 and opened in 2016 as the National Museum of African American History and Culture.

108
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:17,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Lewis taught us persistence.

109
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:23,863
[SPEAKER_06]: He taught us that when a person has transformative ideas, they should not taper those ideas.

110
00:14:25,004 --> 00:14:29,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead, they should push those ideas until others get on board.

111
00:14:31,048 --> 00:14:38,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Simply because change is slow does not mean change agents have to move slowly towards it.

112
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:46,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Lewis was a lightning bolt for equity, social justice, and social change.

113
00:14:47,623 --> 00:14:56,313
[SPEAKER_06]: We must continue his legacy and never forget history, always pursue equity, and let's get in some good trouble.

114
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:58,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

115
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,122
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, just wow, just wow.

116
00:16:03,142 --> 00:16:11,064
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you all three, my dear friends, Beth and Stacy and Bobby, Robert Hayes.

117
00:16:16,288 --> 00:16:21,514
[SPEAKER_11]: I stand with you in believing that all three civil rights champions changed the world for the good.

118
00:16:22,175 --> 00:16:25,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Their sacrifices are both historic and well-documented.

119
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:32,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Sharing these reflections gives the opportunity to see Martin Luther King Jr.'

120
00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:36,170
[SPEAKER_11]: 's collaborative influence over so many in the movement.

121
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:45,100
[SPEAKER_11]: As we move forward, I want us to move even more deeply into today's theme and challenge.

122
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:54,563
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you don't mind indulging the poet in me, I'd like to share a new piece written for just such a time as this.

123
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:59,945
[SPEAKER_11]: It's my first time sharing it, and I hope it gets you fired up.

124
00:17:00,965 --> 00:17:07,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Please give this rendition a mindful listen if we don't quit.

125
00:17:09,273 --> 00:17:17,616
[SPEAKER_11]: If we don't quit, we can protest our plight with the alacrity and tenacity of Medgar and Malcolm and Martin.

126
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:25,199
[SPEAKER_11]: We can purge our psyches of guilt and shame and isolation like Mandela at Robin Island's release.

127
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,622
[SPEAKER_11]: We can pause the clock on the desecration of our tribes and our villages.

128
00:17:30,702 --> 00:17:36,204
[SPEAKER_11]: We can plow the fields of our ancestors and plant the seeds of the dreams they left us.

129
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:43,719
[SPEAKER_11]: We can post the news of the fall of our demons and pursue new justice with grace and creativity.

130
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:51,345
[SPEAKER_11]: We can push back against the ugliness and ignorance of a society drunk again with predatory whiteness.

131
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:59,167
[SPEAKER_11]: We can plan celebrations with our true allies and propose toasts and salute our heroes.

132
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:04,012
[SPEAKER_11]: We can promote our culture with righteous pride in the face of our detractors.

133
00:18:04,373 --> 00:18:10,379
[SPEAKER_11]: We can protect our progeny, our probity, and our dignity with the content of our character.

134
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:17,967
[SPEAKER_11]: We can peacefully advance against red lines and black codes and institutional systems of oppression.

135
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:22,451
[SPEAKER_11]: We can purposefully move the wheels of positive change forward.

136
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:27,657
[SPEAKER_11]: We can permanently say no to hate for hate's sake alone.

137
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:30,239
[SPEAKER_11]: If we don't quit.

138
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:35,752
[SPEAKER_11]: We will vindicate the sacrifices of our lost leaders and slain advocates.

139
00:18:36,353 --> 00:18:41,458
[SPEAKER_11]: We will validate the legitimacy of our journey to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

140
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:47,123
[SPEAKER_11]: We will venerate the greatness of our poets, prophets, griots, and sages.

141
00:18:47,463 --> 00:18:56,352
[SPEAKER_11]: We will rightly divide the testimonies of our seers and record the witness like Ida B., Zora Neale, Maya, and Nikki.

142
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:01,200
[SPEAKER_11]: We will vacuum up the dirt that a mountain of malice has heaped upon us.

143
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:09,363
[SPEAKER_11]: We will vouchsafe an inheritance of restoration and repair for a sea of iniquities against us.

144
00:19:10,163 --> 00:19:15,645
[SPEAKER_11]: We will vaporize a legion of assassins who lie in wait for any lack of vigilance.

145
00:19:16,345 --> 00:19:23,228
[SPEAKER_11]: We will visualize with eyes wide open the hazardous ascent of the hellbound and the hysterical.

146
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:29,915
[SPEAKER_11]: We will vaccinate our young with the overflowing vial of courage under fire.

147
00:19:31,242 --> 00:19:32,502
[SPEAKER_11]: if we don't quit.

148
00:19:33,343 --> 00:19:40,905
[SPEAKER_11]: New histories will avow that we were as valorous as Nat Turner and Denmark Vesey and Sister Rosa.

149
00:19:41,485 --> 00:19:49,027
[SPEAKER_11]: That we rose victorious like Monsa Musa, Shaka Zulu, and the Black Moors who civilized Aryan heathens across Europe.

150
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:57,230
[SPEAKER_11]: That we called out vociferously to mass denizens who perched in the caverns and bivouacs, come out if you dare.

151
00:19:58,354 --> 00:20:08,980
[SPEAKER_11]: that we form the vanguard who watches over the village in silent strength, that we rent asunder the veils, cloaks, and robes of the angry mobs and frenzied marauders.

152
00:20:09,981 --> 00:20:15,744
[SPEAKER_11]: If we don't quit, we can cast our vote for brown equity and black excellence.

153
00:20:16,284 --> 00:20:22,588
[SPEAKER_11]: We can assemble in new vicinities and new vacancies and new versions of our former vagrancy.

154
00:20:23,593 --> 00:20:29,458
[SPEAKER_11]: We can add glowingly to the lyricist's verses and the composer's canon and the arranger's concerto.

155
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:35,743
[SPEAKER_11]: We can bring harmony and melody to the mix of global voices who make up our choir.

156
00:20:36,363 --> 00:20:42,228
[SPEAKER_11]: We can pen indelible pages, chapters, and volumes to the stories of a thousand nations.

157
00:20:42,648 --> 00:20:50,755
[SPEAKER_11]: We can be deemed so valiant that the slings and arrows of the bard's decree will cease to call our fortune outrageous.

158
00:20:51,645 --> 00:21:00,528
[SPEAKER_11]: We can regard the night sky with blissful wonder while inquisitors sleep forever in the hard bed of their own fiery damnation.

159
00:21:01,248 --> 00:21:11,072
[SPEAKER_11]: We can be resolute in knowing that their litany of vice will never cradle their heads with aught but recrimination and regrets.

160
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:13,753
[SPEAKER_11]: If we don't quit,

161
00:21:14,663 --> 00:21:16,925
[SPEAKER_11]: We will give the valedictory address.

162
00:21:17,665 --> 00:21:21,288
[SPEAKER_11]: We will speak of veracity and visions and vanity fair.

163
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:25,251
[SPEAKER_11]: We will curse visions, vituperation, and vile intent.

164
00:21:25,771 --> 00:21:31,656
[SPEAKER_11]: We will castigate the pervasive virus of racism and social justice in our midst.

165
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:34,778
[SPEAKER_11]: We will lead the songs of our people.

166
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:37,921
[SPEAKER_11]: This land is your land.

167
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,783
[SPEAKER_11]: This land is my land.

168
00:21:41,523 --> 00:21:43,465
[SPEAKER_11]: This land was made for you and me.

169
00:21:44,795 --> 00:21:50,518
[SPEAKER_11]: For deep in my heart, I do believe we shall overcome someday.

170
00:21:51,699 --> 00:22:02,384
[SPEAKER_11]: And free at last, free at last, thank God almighty, we are free at last.

171
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

172
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:12,390
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

173
00:22:15,987 --> 00:22:16,207
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

174
00:22:19,128 --> 00:22:19,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

175
00:22:19,689 --> 00:22:20,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

176
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:21,870
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

177
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:25,311
[SPEAKER_11]: We.

178
00:22:28,772 --> 00:22:29,733
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, let me do it like this.

179
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:32,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you engaged to move forward with us?

180
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:34,675
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of weak.

181
00:22:34,975 --> 00:22:36,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you engaged to move forward with us?

182
00:22:37,336 --> 00:22:37,656
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

183
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:38,056
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

184
00:22:38,437 --> 00:22:39,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get a little.

185
00:22:39,657 --> 00:22:40,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get with it.

186
00:22:40,678 --> 00:22:41,418
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so.

187
00:22:43,132 --> 00:22:44,653
[SPEAKER_11]: the Drum Major Awards.

188
00:22:45,593 --> 00:22:56,939
[SPEAKER_11]: At last year's MLK celebration, we continued a new WMC tradition of honoring epic community leadership in a number of important areas.

189
00:22:57,499 --> 00:23:08,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Today, we'll award our third annual Drum Major Awards, picking up on Dr. King's notion of leading out and being in the business of building beloved community.

190
00:23:09,385 --> 00:23:19,833
[SPEAKER_11]: These WMCC Drum Major Awards focus on the categories of civic engagement and public service, arts advocacy, faith in action.

191
00:23:20,674 --> 00:23:32,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Here to present those awards are Lisa Crossman and WMCC Board President, excuse me, WMCC Board Member Brian Collins.

192
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:23,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, our first award for civic engagement and community advocacy is given to posthumously our friend and beloved member, Clarence Ed Ligon.

193
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

194
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:38,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

195
00:25:02,616 --> 00:25:15,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Terry always said one of the hardest parts of this job is when we begin to lose people, which didn't have an impact on me the first year, but these past few years, this becomes harder and harder.

196
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:21,738
[SPEAKER_10]: The 2026 MLK Jr.

197
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:33,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Drum Major Award posthumously to Clarence Ed Ligon, in view of his long-standing civic and social significance to the West Medford community and to greater Medford,

198
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:50,817
[SPEAKER_10]: As a builder of bridges, a connector, an advocate for racial harmony and justice, particularly as a stalwart member of the Mystic Valley Branch NAACP, we gratefully present this acknowledgement.

199
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:07,877
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give it a try.

200
00:26:08,677 --> 00:26:11,198
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm losing my voice on top of everything else, so.

201
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:15,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Ed would be so thrilled to get this award.

202
00:26:16,061 --> 00:26:27,547
[SPEAKER_09]: He, particularly since both of us retired, one of the things he really enjoyed doing was work with the NAACP and with the West Medford Community Center.

203
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:34,795
[SPEAKER_09]: And we kind of made sure when we made plans to do things, sometimes it was a little annoying.

204
00:26:35,396 --> 00:26:42,844
[SPEAKER_09]: We had to look at the calendar to see what was on the calendar for the NAACP or for the community center.

205
00:26:43,505 --> 00:26:47,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Because he just loved doing what he did with those two organizations.

206
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:49,391
[SPEAKER_09]: So, thank you so much.

207
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:20,870
[SPEAKER_11]: So, this next award is presented for arts and culture, and it's presented to Adele Travisano.

208
00:27:30,112 --> 00:27:54,392
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you visit the West Medford Community Center, and you should if you haven't, and you stop by our offices where Lisa and I do our business with elder services and her managing the whole biz, there's a portrait of Alonzo Fields, White House butler to four presidents.

209
00:27:55,312 --> 00:27:56,612
[SPEAKER_11]: and he's with Harry Truman.

210
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:03,814
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also a portrait of Madeline Duggar Kelly, grand diva of West Medford.

211
00:28:04,754 --> 00:28:08,155
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a portrait of Mabry Dock Counts.

212
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:19,918
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mabry Dock Counts was the first person to receive full press credentials for the Boston Red Sox and a lot of other national teams.

213
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:22,619
[SPEAKER_11]: He also covered the Negro Leagues in baseball.

214
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:44,938
[SPEAKER_11]: He was the first to follow Charlie Booker, who was a Medford firefighter, but before that he was a hockey player, and he was a really, really good hockey player, got a tryout with the Boston Bruins, and could have done some things had race not been such an issue back in his day.

215
00:28:45,618 --> 00:28:48,460
[SPEAKER_11]: But she painted those portraits, they're magnificent.

216
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,641
[SPEAKER_11]: If you haven't seen them, you should.

217
00:28:51,462 --> 00:29:02,850
[SPEAKER_11]: And we just wanted to acknowledge the prominence that she has played in the life of artistic Medford, and particularly in the life of cultural West Medford.

218
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:15,557
[SPEAKER_03]: West Medford Community Center is honored to present the 2026 MLK Jr.

219
00:29:15,978 --> 00:29:19,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Drum Major Award to Adele Travisano.

220
00:29:28,803 --> 00:29:55,659
[SPEAKER_03]: In view of your longstanding cultural and artistic significance to the West Medford community and the greater Medford, as an outstanding visual artist and preserver of local, regional, and national history, and an avid supporter of the arts, you have been a trusted and loyal friend of the historic West Medford neighborhood.

221
00:30:02,775 --> 00:30:04,017
Oh, I didn't even see you there.

222
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:25,377
[SPEAKER_08]: I was so happy to start the Doc Counts Arts Festival, named after my dear friend Doc Counts, Mabry Doc Counts.

223
00:30:26,037 --> 00:30:33,903
[SPEAKER_08]: After I painted portraits in City Hall in 1994, he declared me the Medford Historical Artist.

224
00:30:39,195 --> 00:30:45,658
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said, I want you to paint my sister Madeline and Alonzo Fields for City Hall, and that's what I did.

225
00:30:46,198 --> 00:30:47,659
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just kept going from there.

226
00:30:47,699 --> 00:30:53,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I did Madeline, and then I did O.G.

227
00:30:53,382 --> 00:30:57,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Phillips for the Puyallup Baptist Church.

228
00:30:57,344 --> 00:31:00,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I painted Florence King for herself.

229
00:31:01,186 --> 00:31:02,166
[SPEAKER_08]: She's a lovely lady.

230
00:31:02,286 --> 00:31:02,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I painted

231
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:08,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Madeline Andrews for the Andrews School.

232
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,300
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's all of them.

233
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,801
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remember, but it's been just a privilege and a pleasure to be welcomed into this community.

234
00:31:17,321 --> 00:31:28,983
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt that when I left my hometown of Waterbury, Connecticut, my Italian enclave of a family, that Doc welcomed me into his African American family, and they all embraced me.

235
00:31:29,424 --> 00:31:31,684
[SPEAKER_08]: So I love them all, and I miss them.

236
00:31:33,462 --> 00:31:35,164
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just very happy to be there.

237
00:31:35,204 --> 00:31:36,266
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you very much, Terry.

238
00:31:36,306 --> 00:31:37,928
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you were thinking of me.

239
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:38,649
[SPEAKER_02]: God bless you.

240
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:39,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

241
00:32:01,308 --> 00:32:04,493
[SPEAKER_11]: And the trophies are really, really lovely.

242
00:32:04,774 --> 00:32:11,725
[SPEAKER_11]: They're a crystal teardrop on a nice base, and they're heavy, so it's good stuff.

243
00:32:15,407 --> 00:32:19,608
[SPEAKER_11]: So now we move on to the Faith in Action Award.

244
00:32:20,168 --> 00:32:30,532
[SPEAKER_11]: And the West Medford community that I grew up in had and has wonderful institutions of faith.

245
00:32:31,012 --> 00:32:35,133
[SPEAKER_11]: The Shiloh Baptist Church, the West Medford Baptist Church, St.

246
00:32:35,173 --> 00:32:39,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Ray Fields, not too far from where we are is the

247
00:32:42,275 --> 00:32:45,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Temple Shalom, Grace Episcopal Church.

248
00:32:45,817 --> 00:32:47,118
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I could go on and on.

249
00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:50,501
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a wonderful place for people of faith.

250
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:57,065
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's made even more wonderful by the recipient of this award, Stacey Clayton.

251
00:33:07,608 --> 00:33:09,630
[SPEAKER_03]: You take it and I'll read it.

252
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:15,735
[SPEAKER_03]: West Memphis Community Center is honored again to present the 2026 MLK Jr.

253
00:33:16,155 --> 00:33:19,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Drum Major Award to Stacey Clayton.

254
00:33:24,965 --> 00:33:34,608
[SPEAKER_03]: in view of your longstanding cultural and spiritual significance to the West Medford community and the greater Medford community.

255
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:46,793
[SPEAKER_03]: As a child development leader, a music minister, and a gospel choir director, and a beloved professional vocalist, we gratefully present this acknowledgment.

256
00:33:55,415 --> 00:33:56,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

257
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

258
00:33:59,678 --> 00:34:04,061
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, that saying, to whom a lot has been given, a lot is expected.

259
00:34:04,301 --> 00:34:06,142
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have been blessed from birth.

260
00:34:06,782 --> 00:34:11,385
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, some of us, we're not necessarily meant to be here, but we're meant to be here.

261
00:34:11,826 --> 00:34:12,926
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm glad I'm here.

262
00:34:13,127 --> 00:34:14,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad I'm in this community.

263
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:20,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this has been one of the most special communities I could have ever lived in.

264
00:34:20,131 --> 00:34:23,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so lucky to have found West Medford.

265
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:24,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to my husband.

266
00:34:24,874 --> 00:34:29,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you guys make heaven on earth by being so welcoming.

267
00:34:30,438 --> 00:34:34,881
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what we were planted here for, to coexist with each other.

268
00:34:35,561 --> 00:34:40,605
[SPEAKER_05]: And let us show the world, starting with our community, how it's to be done.

269
00:34:41,806 --> 00:34:44,548
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no need to be afraid of our differences.

270
00:34:44,808 --> 00:34:47,009
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually is exciting to learn.

271
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,151
[SPEAKER_05]: And it actually enriches us.

272
00:34:49,511 --> 00:34:52,173
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for giving me the honor to be with you today.

273
00:35:03,653 --> 00:35:18,857
[SPEAKER_11]: So something you should be out on the lookout for is every year Stacey hosts a gospel concert commemorating Black History Month at the Somerville Community Baptist Church.

274
00:35:18,877 --> 00:35:24,658
[SPEAKER_11]: It's around the corner and down the street near Davis Square.

275
00:35:25,178 --> 00:35:28,639
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is a wonderful celebratory event.

276
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:32,300
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you like this, you should check out that.

277
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:33,620
OK.

278
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:34,720
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

279
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:41,422
[SPEAKER_11]: And finally, we've got a lot of snowbirds in West Medford now.

280
00:35:41,742 --> 00:35:52,405
[SPEAKER_11]: They leave and they go down to Florida and Arizona and those kinds of places to get sun while we're dealing with three and four inches of snow and sleet and rain and all that.

281
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:58,546
[SPEAKER_11]: And our next recipient is a snowbird, so she's not here to join us.

282
00:36:01,595 --> 00:36:08,903
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't say that she's the most interesting, but she is certainly the most determined of our four recipients.

283
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:12,988
[SPEAKER_11]: She is 103 years old, but she's still vibrant, she's still

284
00:36:19,735 --> 00:36:20,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Fresh.

285
00:36:21,336 --> 00:36:24,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, oh my God, she's fresh.

286
00:36:25,438 --> 00:36:28,419
[SPEAKER_11]: She's fresh like lifting up a mini skirt fresh.

287
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,241
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and she's a delight.

288
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:38,824
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of you who frequent the community center, especially for our senior lunches, know her.

289
00:36:38,924 --> 00:36:43,767
[SPEAKER_11]: She is Gwendolyn Lee, and she is being presented with our Legacy Award.

290
00:36:43,807 --> 00:36:47,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Richard's gonna come get it.

291
00:36:49,851 --> 00:36:59,068
[SPEAKER_11]: And since she's down in Florida with her daughter, Rachel Tanner, the president of the senior club, West Meffrey Senior Club, is going to accept the award for her.

292
00:37:03,837 --> 00:37:11,562
[SPEAKER_10]: The West Medford Community Center is honored to present the 2026 MLK Junior Drum Major Award to Gwendolyn Lee.

293
00:37:12,282 --> 00:37:26,112
[SPEAKER_10]: In view of her amazing legacy in the West Medford neighborhood, as well as her active and engaged presence as a centenarian in the local senior community of the historic West Medford Enclave,

294
00:37:26,952 --> 00:37:32,294
[SPEAKER_10]: She remains a cherished mother, friend, role model, and teller of our stories.

295
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:35,775
[SPEAKER_10]: And she is such a firecracker.

296
00:37:37,515 --> 00:37:39,456
[SPEAKER_10]: We present this award to Gwendolyn Lee.

297
00:37:48,921 --> 00:37:49,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?

298
00:37:49,902 --> 00:37:55,066
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly think this is an honor for me to be able to accept this award.

299
00:37:55,426 --> 00:37:57,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Gwen is a near and dear friend of mine.

300
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:04,213
[SPEAKER_01]: We speak, since she's in Florida, we speak every week, sometimes twice a week.

301
00:38:04,693 --> 00:38:09,197
[SPEAKER_01]: She, and as everybody says, what Terry just said, this is not makeup.

302
00:38:09,717 --> 00:38:12,479
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 100% Gwen Lee.

303
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,841
[SPEAKER_01]: She is a firecracker.

304
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:17,163
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean a firecracker.

305
00:38:17,643 --> 00:38:23,488
[SPEAKER_01]: And if some of the folks here have seen her, she still walks around West Medford.

306
00:38:23,748 --> 00:38:25,950
[SPEAKER_01]: She walks around to the Litty Kitty Park.

307
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:29,092
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll sit down there when the weather is really good.

308
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,774
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can say, if you see her,

309
00:38:31,414 --> 00:38:34,737
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Gwen Lee, our little 103-year-old.

310
00:38:35,157 --> 00:38:39,020
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the good Lord is merciful, in July of this year, she will be 104.

311
00:38:40,922 --> 00:38:51,831
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a blessing to all of us, to be able to know somebody that is still able to walk, talk, and still have good presence of mind.

312
00:38:52,311 --> 00:38:56,554
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is our Gwen Lee, and she is my near and dear friend.

313
00:38:56,915 --> 00:39:00,698
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is truly an honor for me to accept this on her behalf.

314
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

315
00:39:12,007 --> 00:39:19,313
[SPEAKER_11]: So we congratulate, we're extremely grateful for the live contributions of each of our drum majors.

316
00:39:19,993 --> 00:39:28,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford really has been blessed by their efforts and their persistent work in building Beloved Community, not only in this city, but beyond.

317
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:34,204
[SPEAKER_11]: And as you can see, today is a family affair for the WMCC.

318
00:39:34,624 --> 00:39:35,605
[SPEAKER_11]: There is talent.

319
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:41,926
[SPEAKER_11]: and community spirit all around us, and we try to take advantage of it wherever possible.

320
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:46,288
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been in existence for 90 years now.

321
00:39:54,410 --> 00:40:02,652
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a gala celebration of our birthday back in December, and we are charging into the future with a can't stop, won't stop attitude.

322
00:40:05,484 --> 00:40:08,246
[SPEAKER_11]: You gotta have friends and you gotta have allies.

323
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:09,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you all agree?

324
00:40:09,828 --> 00:40:11,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, all right, all right.

325
00:40:13,171 --> 00:40:16,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, because we have both and we're showing them off today.

326
00:40:16,974 --> 00:40:27,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Athene Wilson is a talented singer whose career began at the age of seven in a small Pentecostal church in Jamaica Munn.

327
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:43,229
[SPEAKER_11]: She moved to Boston to start professional singing, her professional singing career, and has since performed in hundreds of venues around Boston and beyond, including the House of Blues and Scholars.

328
00:40:45,302 --> 00:40:48,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Athene's music spans jazz, gospel, and R&B.

329
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:52,090
[SPEAKER_11]: She has accompanied several local artists and bands.

330
00:40:52,511 --> 00:41:01,982
[SPEAKER_11]: She has performed internationally, including in Germany, France, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, the Caribbean, and most recently in Italy.

331
00:41:02,803 --> 00:41:11,152
[SPEAKER_11]: She's a three-time Boston Urban Music Award winner and has performed at numerous private and public events all over the state, region, and country.

332
00:41:11,832 --> 00:41:15,917
[SPEAKER_11]: She is singing a cappella with a cooperative mission in mind.

333
00:41:15,977 --> 00:41:19,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Ladies and gentlemen, here's Athene Wilson.

334
00:41:33,598 --> 00:41:34,038
All right.

335
00:41:34,799 --> 00:41:35,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Brother Terry.

336
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:38,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you all.

337
00:41:39,923 --> 00:41:40,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Good afternoon.

338
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,925
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

339
00:41:43,366 --> 00:41:46,528
[SPEAKER_13]: So give yourselves a hand for being here.

340
00:41:46,568 --> 00:41:48,410
[SPEAKER_13]: What a wonderful, wonderful afternoon.

341
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,171
[SPEAKER_13]: What a wonderful mission.

342
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:52,173
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so happy to be here.

343
00:41:52,253 --> 00:41:57,097
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you'll indulge me for a little bit, we can do this, all right?

344
00:41:59,038 --> 00:42:01,260
[SPEAKER_13]: The song is called, If I Can Help Somebody.

345
00:42:03,598 --> 00:42:10,381
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope these words stay in your heart and this whole day you take it forward.

346
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:11,642
[SPEAKER_13]: All right?

347
00:42:12,782 --> 00:42:13,143
[SPEAKER_13]: Amen?

348
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:26,549
[SPEAKER_13]: If I can help somebody as I travel along.

349
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:32,112
[SPEAKER_13]: If I can help somebody.

350
00:42:33,613 --> 00:42:37,776
[SPEAKER_13]: with a word or a song.

351
00:42:38,997 --> 00:42:58,130
[SPEAKER_13]: If I can help somebody from doing wrong, then my living shall not be in vain.

352
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Then my living

353
00:43:02,394 --> 00:43:07,098
[SPEAKER_13]: shall not be in vain.

354
00:43:07,298 --> 00:43:14,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Then my living shall not be in vain.

355
00:43:15,784 --> 00:43:24,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, if I can help somebody as I pass.

356
00:43:25,487 --> 00:43:39,661
[SPEAKER_13]: alone, then my living shall not be in vain, if I can do my duty as a good man ought.

357
00:43:45,795 --> 00:44:11,467
[SPEAKER_13]: If I can bring back beauty in a world abroad, if I can spread love's message as the master taught, then my living shall not be in vain.

358
00:44:13,732 --> 00:44:19,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Then my living shall not be in vain.

359
00:44:19,133 --> 00:44:23,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Then my living shall not be in vain if I can have

360
00:44:34,263 --> 00:44:47,454
[SPEAKER_13]: somebody as I pass along, then my living shall not be in vain.

361
00:44:48,615 --> 00:44:58,062
[SPEAKER_13]: If I can help somebody as I'm singing this song,

362
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:08,856
[SPEAKER_13]: I know my living shall not be in vain.

363
00:45:09,477 --> 00:45:09,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

364
00:45:34,337 --> 00:45:37,960
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let me slip into my pastoral anointing for a second.

365
00:45:39,502 --> 00:45:44,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Hallelujah!

366
00:45:44,386 --> 00:45:45,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Glory!

367
00:45:45,907 --> 00:45:50,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't that amazing?

368
00:45:51,672 --> 00:45:53,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's have another howdy round for Athene Wilson.

369
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:07,962
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure Dr. King is watching a lot of what's going on down here on the third rock.

370
00:46:08,783 --> 00:46:13,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Whole lot of Dr. King celebrations taking place all over everywhere, right?

371
00:46:15,004 --> 00:46:16,665
[SPEAKER_11]: But you picked the right one, baby.

372
00:46:22,486 --> 00:46:22,906
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

373
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:25,507
[SPEAKER_11]: It has been quite a first half.

374
00:46:26,215 --> 00:46:33,921
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna break now for some refreshment and an opportunity for y'all folks to connect a bit more with whoever is at your table.

375
00:46:34,702 --> 00:46:42,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Our volunteers, actually, I'm gonna, so you've been at these tables for a minute now and I'm sure you've noticed some things.

376
00:46:42,488 --> 00:46:45,010
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, you've noticed how beautiful they are.

377
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:48,513
[SPEAKER_11]: That is because of the artistry of Ketley Tucker.

378
00:46:56,014 --> 00:47:10,423
[SPEAKER_11]: and the help that she's received from Charmaine Arlene, and Stacey Moore, and Lisa, and Pam Gavin, all here this morning helping to set things right in the room.

379
00:47:12,764 --> 00:47:21,089
[SPEAKER_11]: But you've also noticed tent cards, and on your tent cards are giants of the civil rights movement.

380
00:47:21,429 --> 00:47:23,450
[SPEAKER_11]: And you see all these different names.

381
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:24,251
[SPEAKER_11]: There are 15 of them.

382
00:47:32,137 --> 00:47:32,397
All right.

383
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:51,851
[SPEAKER_11]: So in order to go over to the table and get you some sandwiches, a little something something to snack on, let's have the Emmett and Mamie Till table go.

384
00:47:53,813 --> 00:47:54,313
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

385
00:47:57,796 --> 00:48:00,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Emmett Till, as you know, was a young boy that was slain.

386
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:07,514
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mamie Till, his mother, became a great advocate in the civil rights movement.

387
01:14:13,006 --> 01:14:13,106
th th

388
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:41,470
Okay.

389
01:15:08,078 --> 01:15:08,238
th th

390
01:15:32,353 --> 01:15:32,534
th th

391
01:15:53,486 --> 01:15:53,626
th th

392
01:16:25,213 --> 01:16:25,574
th th

393
01:16:50,071 --> 01:16:50,191
th th

394
01:17:15,649 --> 01:17:16,049
th th

395
01:18:13,282 --> 01:18:15,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, folks, we're going to start it moving again.

396
01:18:17,864 --> 01:18:28,806
[SPEAKER_11]: My associate, Charmaine, and those who she designates as help, they're going to come visit your table.

397
01:18:42,089 --> 01:18:45,850
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so admission of guilt.

398
01:18:48,442 --> 01:18:57,704
[SPEAKER_11]: I was supposed to get a bunch of pens, writing pens, and I failed to do that.

399
01:18:57,904 --> 01:19:06,887
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want to apologize in advance that you'll have to supply your own writing implement for this, okay?

400
01:19:07,247 --> 01:19:09,567
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the first thing, okay?

401
01:19:11,068 --> 01:19:12,028
[SPEAKER_11]: The second thing is,

402
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:21,192
[SPEAKER_11]: I really, really hope everybody is refreshed and energized.

403
01:19:22,893 --> 01:19:37,098
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to get into the remainder of our speaking program in a little while, but we just want to take some time to walk you through an exercise of community building at your table.

404
01:19:38,054 --> 01:19:38,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

405
01:19:38,995 --> 01:19:39,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a little while.

406
01:19:39,936 --> 01:19:44,921
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to challenge your minds and your meetups with a group activity.

407
01:19:45,702 --> 01:19:46,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

408
01:19:46,463 --> 01:19:48,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, there are no prizes.

409
01:19:52,169 --> 01:19:56,474
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is not, repeat, this is not a competition.

410
01:19:58,537 --> 01:19:59,017
[SPEAKER_11]: All right?

411
01:20:00,158 --> 01:20:06,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Our contributions may not be equal, but our intentions certainly can be.

412
01:20:07,143 --> 01:20:07,504
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

413
01:20:07,784 --> 01:20:14,849
[SPEAKER_11]: So at the West Medford Community Center, we believe that we can do more together than we can ever do apart.

414
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:17,711
[SPEAKER_11]: They say it at my church as well all the time.

415
01:20:18,652 --> 01:20:21,874
[SPEAKER_11]: And Dr. King most definitely believed that as well.

416
01:20:22,215 --> 01:20:27,399
[SPEAKER_11]: His journey in life was marked with collaborations, allies, and partnerships.

417
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:37,762
[SPEAKER_11]: So coming around to the table, all right, and giving to each of you is going to be a word search, okay?

418
01:20:39,476 --> 01:20:49,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, one of our regulars at the West Memphis Community Center's senior lunches is a woman by the name of Dorothy King, or Dottie as we call her.

419
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:52,239
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is her stock and trade.

420
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:53,659
[SPEAKER_11]: She loves a word search.

421
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:56,520
[SPEAKER_11]: She has a word search book with her all the time.

422
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,901
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where I actually got the inspiration for this.

423
01:21:00,661 --> 01:21:02,942
[SPEAKER_11]: But on your word search,

424
01:21:04,347 --> 01:21:09,649
[SPEAKER_11]: With no key, there are 22 words that you are charged with finding.

425
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:23,855
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going to happen is I'm going to call out the word, and each person at the table searches for the word, circles it, and shares what they found with the other people at the table.

426
01:21:23,935 --> 01:21:27,017
[SPEAKER_11]: The idea is that the table is

427
01:21:28,337 --> 01:21:31,958
[SPEAKER_11]: the victor, not the individual, the table.

428
01:21:32,338 --> 01:21:34,199
[SPEAKER_11]: So we want to be in community.

429
01:21:34,779 --> 01:21:39,801
[SPEAKER_11]: If you find other words before I call out the next one, do the same with your table mates.

430
01:21:40,101 --> 01:21:41,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Give them the heads up.

431
01:21:41,641 --> 01:21:46,763
[SPEAKER_11]: So in this pursuit, process matters more than results.

432
01:21:47,303 --> 01:21:48,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Be community.

433
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:51,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Be helpful and be respectful.

434
01:21:51,584 --> 01:21:52,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't start writing.

435
01:21:55,228 --> 01:21:56,829
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, don't start writing.

436
01:21:57,809 --> 01:22:00,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Y'all not following instructions.

437
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:06,074
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, you just launch right in, like you know exactly what's happening.

438
01:22:06,334 --> 01:22:07,014
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, hold on.

439
01:22:07,534 --> 01:22:09,295
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not rocket science.

440
01:22:09,936 --> 01:22:11,416
[SPEAKER_11]: It's social science.

441
01:22:12,057 --> 01:22:15,979
[SPEAKER_11]: And to keep it moving forward, we want to gain peace.

442
01:22:16,359 --> 01:22:19,861
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to sponsor equality and justice.

443
01:22:20,601 --> 01:22:23,323
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one of the big points of today.

444
01:22:24,323 --> 01:22:27,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Peace, justice, and equality.

445
01:22:27,325 --> 01:22:32,328
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to get good at it, and we have to get good at it all over again.

446
01:22:33,508 --> 01:22:33,848
[SPEAKER_11]: OK?

447
01:22:34,189 --> 01:22:36,070
[SPEAKER_11]: So the first word, struggle.

448
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:37,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Go on and find it.

449
01:22:38,151 --> 01:22:39,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Find it and share it.

450
01:22:42,133 --> 01:22:42,533
[SPEAKER_11]: OK?

451
01:22:42,714 --> 01:22:44,475
[SPEAKER_11]: In community, find it, share it.

452
01:22:48,157 --> 01:22:48,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

453
01:22:55,475 --> 01:22:57,096
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, second word, peace.

454
01:22:58,877 --> 01:22:59,277
[SPEAKER_11]: All right?

455
01:23:00,357 --> 01:23:01,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Find it, share it.

456
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:09,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Third word, American.

457
01:23:09,961 --> 01:23:12,042
[SPEAKER_11]: We are all American.

458
01:23:12,062 --> 01:23:21,487
[SPEAKER_11]: All of us that are here, some of us may be visiting from a foreign land, but today in this hall, you're an American, okay?

459
01:23:22,587 --> 01:23:24,548
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't play no ice up in this piece.

460
01:23:27,392 --> 01:23:30,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we don't play that.

461
01:23:31,655 --> 01:23:33,997
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, next word, freedom.

462
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:38,740
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, find it, share it.

463
01:23:42,822 --> 01:23:49,567
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, come on, smart people in the room, good visual acuity, you can see it, you know it.

464
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:53,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Fifth word, equality, find equality.

465
01:23:57,265 --> 01:24:00,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Find it, share it, okay?

466
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:06,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Six words, six words, leader, leader.

467
01:24:15,034 --> 01:24:16,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Find it, share it.

468
01:24:18,276 --> 01:24:21,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Next word, justice, justice.

469
01:24:23,771 --> 01:24:24,251
[SPEAKER_11]: All right?

470
01:24:25,051 --> 01:24:28,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes we feel like it's just us, but it's justice.

471
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:32,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Find it, share it.

472
01:24:38,194 --> 01:24:39,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Eighth word, courage.

473
01:24:41,115 --> 01:24:41,635
[SPEAKER_11]: All right?

474
01:24:43,015 --> 01:24:43,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Courage.

475
01:24:44,696 --> 01:24:46,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Hit your courage to the sticking post.

476
01:24:46,856 --> 01:24:47,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go.

477
01:24:48,096 --> 01:24:48,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Courage.

478
01:24:49,937 --> 01:24:50,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Find it, share it.

479
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:58,424
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

480
01:24:59,465 --> 01:25:00,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Ninth word.

481
01:25:00,286 --> 01:25:04,209
[SPEAKER_11]: This is for anybody in the room that feels like they want to go out and slap somebody.

482
01:25:04,649 --> 01:25:05,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Nonviolent.

483
01:25:07,171 --> 01:25:07,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

484
01:25:08,633 --> 01:25:09,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Peaceful resistance.

485
01:25:09,974 --> 01:25:11,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Nonviolent.

486
01:25:19,842 --> 01:25:20,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Find it and share it.

487
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:23,685
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

488
01:25:26,243 --> 01:25:34,105
[SPEAKER_11]: 10th word, activist, activist, A-C-T-I-V-I-S-T, activist.

489
01:25:36,685 --> 01:25:37,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Find it, share it.

490
01:25:44,807 --> 01:25:47,967
[SPEAKER_11]: 11th word, Alabama, Alabama.

491
01:25:49,748 --> 01:25:52,068
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Alabama, find it, share it.

492
01:25:58,366 --> 01:26:00,908
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, come on, smart people, smart people.

493
01:26:03,329 --> 01:26:05,231
[SPEAKER_11]: 12th word, movement.

494
01:26:06,531 --> 01:26:07,032
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

495
01:26:09,574 --> 01:26:17,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Movement, we are going to establish a new movement toward peace, equality, and social justice.

496
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,501
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna sprinkle a little bit of equity in there.

497
01:26:21,541 --> 01:26:25,104
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna have some diversity and some inclusion.

498
01:26:27,176 --> 01:26:28,657
[SPEAKER_11]: but the word is movement.

499
01:26:36,121 --> 01:26:38,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, 13th word, brotherhood.

500
01:26:39,382 --> 01:26:41,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Brotherhood, find it, share it.

501
01:26:41,423 --> 01:26:44,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

502
01:26:50,968 --> 01:26:53,850
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, 14th word, reverend, reverend.

503
01:27:01,107 --> 01:27:05,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Reverend, R-E-V-E-R-E-N-D, Reverend.

504
01:27:08,388 --> 01:27:09,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Like Reverend Kilpatrick.

505
01:27:16,669 --> 01:27:18,290
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, okay.

506
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:21,990
[SPEAKER_11]: 15th word, respect, respect.

507
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:25,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, respect, find it and share it.

508
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:36,523
[SPEAKER_11]: 16th word, leadership, leadership.

509
01:27:36,964 --> 01:27:39,766
[SPEAKER_11]: You had leader already, now you have leadership.

510
01:27:42,909 --> 01:27:45,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, long word, should be easy to find.

511
01:27:47,914 --> 01:27:52,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, 17th word, protest, protest.

512
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:56,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, somebody find it, share it.

513
01:28:05,395 --> 01:28:06,676
[SPEAKER_11]: 18, dream.

514
01:28:07,276 --> 01:28:08,897
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a dream.

515
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:26,426
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, 19th word, boycott.

516
01:28:27,747 --> 01:28:28,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Boycott.

517
01:28:36,543 --> 01:28:38,565
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, as in Target and Amazon.

518
01:28:38,665 --> 01:28:39,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, did I say that out loud?

519
01:28:40,086 --> 01:28:40,607
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

520
01:28:41,688 --> 01:28:42,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Boycott.

521
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:52,518
[SPEAKER_11]: 20th word, African.

522
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:54,380
[SPEAKER_11]: African.

523
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Hallelujah.

524
01:29:00,977 --> 01:29:05,040
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we're getting down to the last 21st word, speech.

525
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:06,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Speech.

526
01:29:16,066 --> 01:29:19,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, final word, final answer, harmony.

527
01:29:21,210 --> 01:29:24,131
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, harmony, H-A-R-M-O-N-Y.

528
01:29:24,232 --> 01:29:25,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's have harmony.

529
01:29:26,933 --> 01:29:28,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Find it, share it.

530
01:29:44,558 --> 01:29:44,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

531
01:29:46,478 --> 01:29:49,439
[SPEAKER_11]: On the honor system, I'm not coming to look.

532
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:55,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Has any table found all 22 words?

533
01:29:57,021 --> 01:29:57,401
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

534
01:29:58,321 --> 01:29:58,521
[SPEAKER_11]: One.

535
01:29:59,442 --> 01:30:00,862
[SPEAKER_11]: What table are you guys?

536
01:30:02,822 --> 01:30:03,483
[SPEAKER_11]: You're Emmett.

537
01:30:03,763 --> 01:30:04,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

538
01:30:04,083 --> 01:30:04,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Mamie Till.

539
01:30:05,023 --> 01:30:05,323
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

540
01:30:05,383 --> 01:30:05,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

541
01:30:07,684 --> 01:30:08,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

542
01:30:09,344 --> 01:30:11,024
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Baird Rustin.

543
01:30:12,465 --> 01:30:12,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

544
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:13,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Who else?

545
01:30:15,458 --> 01:30:17,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Coretta Scott, okay, and who else?

546
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:21,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, that's the first four, all right.

547
01:30:28,562 --> 01:30:29,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't confuse me.

548
01:30:36,164 --> 01:30:41,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, like I said, not a competition, okay?

549
01:30:49,799 --> 01:30:55,023
[SPEAKER_11]: And the prize angle I'm working on, okay?

550
01:30:55,143 --> 01:30:56,704
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm working on the prize angle.

551
01:30:56,724 --> 01:30:58,005
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't figured it out yet.

552
01:31:03,790 --> 01:31:09,314
[SPEAKER_11]: But the idea, as you could probably see, is that we're better together.

553
01:31:09,455 --> 01:31:13,238
[SPEAKER_11]: We can do more together than we can ever do by ourselves.

554
01:31:14,327 --> 01:31:24,350
[SPEAKER_11]: And just by sitting at the table and talking with the folks at your table and finding words, it gives us an opportunity to see that we're not so different.

555
01:31:27,311 --> 01:31:31,653
[SPEAKER_11]: We may not see things exactly the same way, but we all see the same things.

556
01:31:35,434 --> 01:31:35,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

557
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:43,337
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so thank you very much for participating.

558
01:31:44,931 --> 01:31:48,453
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we recognize that, very good.

559
01:31:51,334 --> 01:31:56,736
[SPEAKER_11]: So we recognize that this is what we'd like to see across the city on a regular basis.

560
01:31:57,496 --> 01:32:07,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Our hope is that all of our community-based institutions can become greater and more effective incubators for the dynamic communion and convening.

561
01:32:07,961 --> 01:32:11,803
[SPEAKER_11]: That is certainly the intent of the West Medford Community Center.

562
01:32:15,968 --> 01:32:24,517
[SPEAKER_11]: So as I said before, we have no shortage of friends and allies who join us on these special WMCC programs.

563
01:32:25,278 --> 01:32:30,224
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm blessed by their willingness to help, by their willingness to step up.

564
01:32:31,485 --> 01:32:32,506
[SPEAKER_11]: So most of you,

565
01:32:33,689 --> 01:32:36,951
[SPEAKER_11]: No or no of my buddy Max Heinegg.

566
01:32:38,032 --> 01:32:45,157
[SPEAKER_11]: He is the third Poet Laureate of Medford, preceded by Vijaya Sundaram and yours truly.

567
01:32:45,978 --> 01:32:48,980
[SPEAKER_11]: He is truly a Renaissance soul.

568
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:59,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, besides being a published poet, multiply, I don't know if that's a word, he's been published a lot.

569
01:33:01,002 --> 01:33:06,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Not only his own books, but journals, all kinds of stuff.

570
01:33:06,205 --> 01:33:07,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Max is prolific.

571
01:33:10,208 --> 01:33:16,772
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a high school teacher, all right, and that in and of itself probably gives him keys to heaven.

572
01:33:18,974 --> 01:33:26,899
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a singer-songwriter, and if that's not enough, he's a brewer of fine spirits.

573
01:33:28,295 --> 01:33:37,934
[SPEAKER_11]: If you go down Harvard Ave to Medford Brewing Company in search of a delicious IPA, Max is your man.

574
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:40,041
[SPEAKER_11]: All right?

575
01:33:41,522 --> 01:33:41,923
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

576
01:33:42,763 --> 01:33:45,606
[SPEAKER_11]: So he's going to share two pieces of work with you.

577
01:33:48,089 --> 01:33:51,512
[SPEAKER_11]: He's going to share a piece that is absolutely a favorite of mine.

578
01:33:51,632 --> 01:34:00,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, one of the first poems I heard, aside from a Phyllis Wheatley poem a long, long time ago, that hit me to the fact that black men wrote poetry.

579
01:34:01,502 --> 01:34:04,583
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a Langston Hughes poem.

580
01:34:04,643 --> 01:34:06,444
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called Mother to Son.

581
01:34:07,165 --> 01:34:10,586
[SPEAKER_11]: So he's going to share that with us, and he's going to share a piece of his own work.

582
01:34:11,006 --> 01:34:15,388
[SPEAKER_11]: So ladies and gentlemen, a nice warm round of applause for Max Heinegg.

583
01:34:22,391 --> 01:34:23,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

584
01:34:23,431 --> 01:34:24,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for having me.

585
01:34:25,312 --> 01:34:26,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Mother to Son by Langston Hughes.

586
01:34:28,339 --> 01:34:33,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, son, I'll tell you, life for me ain't been no crystal stair.

587
01:34:34,725 --> 01:34:43,152
[SPEAKER_04]: It's had tacks in it, and splinters, and boards torn up, and places with no carpet on the floor, bare.

588
01:34:44,013 --> 01:34:52,620
[SPEAKER_04]: But all the time I've been climbing on, and reaching landings, and turning corners, and sometimes going in the dark where there ain't been no light.

589
01:34:53,661 --> 01:34:55,523
[SPEAKER_04]: So, boy, don't you turn back.

590
01:34:57,037 --> 01:35:00,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you set down on the steps, because you'll find it's kind of hard.

591
01:35:00,903 --> 01:35:03,367
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't you fall now, for I'm still going, honey.

592
01:35:03,648 --> 01:35:04,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still climbing.

593
01:35:05,270 --> 01:35:07,955
[SPEAKER_04]: And life for me ain't been no crystal stair.

594
01:35:17,048 --> 01:35:31,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to do kind of like a low-key companion piece, just a little bit about how I've been feeling lately about my students who I think are, we're all alive at a difficult time right now, but I think the students,

595
01:35:33,372 --> 01:35:40,516
[SPEAKER_04]: have a lot of challenges, maybe some unique ones, and this is just to let them know that I think we are all here for them.

596
01:35:41,397 --> 01:35:49,822
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was mother to son, this is teacher to student, or in the theme of today, advice to the student who wants to quit.

597
01:35:50,703 --> 01:35:58,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And there'll be two moments where it'll seem obvious that I'm gonna try to get you to say don't quit with me, and I'll probably point at you just like a teacher.

598
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:06,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my student, my charge, I've seen you struggling with the world you've inherited.

599
01:36:07,683 --> 01:36:29,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen you trying to find your balance on this shaky ground, trying to swim, drowning in screens, trying to walk with ice on our streets, trying to assert yourself, facing the danger in being who you are, trying to be independent with the expectation of servility and conformity,

600
01:36:29,852 --> 01:36:35,014
[SPEAKER_04]: the greed and damage of a system that is built to keep you powerless and disenfranchised.

601
01:36:36,135 --> 01:36:44,819
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is tempting to recede in the shadows, to let others do the work, to wait for someone to stand up for you.

602
01:36:45,859 --> 01:36:49,981
[SPEAKER_04]: And while you're young, you can do it a little bit.

603
01:36:51,102 --> 01:36:51,742
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't quit.

604
01:36:53,443 --> 01:36:54,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Say it with me now.

605
01:36:55,125 --> 01:36:55,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't quit.

606
01:36:57,168 --> 01:37:06,819
[SPEAKER_04]: As much as the only life you get to live needs you to be that bravery, we need you to be that bravery.

607
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:09,322
[SPEAKER_04]: When we see someone stand up,

608
01:37:10,163 --> 01:37:10,944
[SPEAKER_04]: We stand up.

609
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:17,390
[SPEAKER_04]: When we hear someone raise their voice in the service of others, we dare to as well.

610
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:26,939
[SPEAKER_04]: The country that needs to awaken and remember its identity and its promise to be a human family needs you.

611
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Each struggle is different.

612
01:37:30,363 --> 01:37:34,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, each struggle is real, but I am here for you.

613
01:37:35,405 --> 01:37:36,786
[SPEAKER_04]: We are here for you.

614
01:37:37,466 --> 01:37:39,387
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be your support beams.

615
01:37:40,308 --> 01:37:41,028
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't quit.

616
01:37:42,208 --> 01:37:44,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got you, and I'm sure you've got me.

617
01:37:45,450 --> 01:37:46,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust me on this.

618
01:37:47,111 --> 01:37:47,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't quit.

619
01:37:48,731 --> 01:37:49,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Say it with me now.

620
01:37:49,572 --> 01:37:51,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't quit.

621
01:37:51,973 --> 01:37:52,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

622
01:38:03,735 --> 01:38:05,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Max understood the assignment clearly.

623
01:38:07,317 --> 01:38:10,858
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Max, thank you once again for your impassioned artistry.

624
01:38:10,879 --> 01:38:22,764
[SPEAKER_11]: We're so happy to have you here with us today, and we appreciate your willingness to join the folks from West Medford at a time when minds and hearts really need to work together across neighborhood lines.

625
01:38:24,125 --> 01:38:32,429
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I imbibed, man, I'm telling you, I'd be down at Medford Brewing Company a little bit later on today trying to get one of those IPAs.

626
01:38:34,463 --> 01:38:34,768
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

627
01:38:38,879 --> 01:38:45,361
[SPEAKER_11]: You may have noticed that today's program has showcased the talents of some wonderful women.

628
01:38:45,941 --> 01:38:47,262
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not an accident.

629
01:38:47,782 --> 01:38:56,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. King was blessed with tremendous relationships with great women who dynamically impacted his work in civil rights and social justice.

630
01:38:57,745 --> 01:39:05,088
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the West Medford Community Center has been an incubator of more talented and inspiring women than I can easily recall.

631
01:39:05,990 --> 01:39:11,233
[SPEAKER_11]: I always want to be mindful of such important role models and contributors.

632
01:39:11,994 --> 01:39:13,655
[SPEAKER_11]: On to the next order of business.

633
01:39:15,252 --> 01:39:23,458
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always a challenge to come up with meaningful messages in a keynote address and to charge to a keynote speaker.

634
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:29,302
[SPEAKER_11]: And trust me on this, because I've been on both the giving and the receiving end.

635
01:39:30,403 --> 01:39:35,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Still, this for me was an easy and obvious choice.

636
01:39:35,747 --> 01:39:38,710
[SPEAKER_11]: The only concern that I had was availability.

637
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:42,739
[SPEAKER_11]: And that problem worked itself out fairly easily.

638
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:46,469
[SPEAKER_11]: And relationships always help in these matters.

639
01:39:47,657 --> 01:39:54,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Sarah Bleich is the inaugural vice provost for special projects at Harvard University.

640
01:39:54,703 --> 01:39:59,127
[SPEAKER_11]: One of those special projects is the Harvard Legacy of Slavery Initiative.

641
01:39:59,928 --> 01:40:05,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Bleich is also a professor of public health policy at the Harvard T.H.

642
01:40:05,112 --> 01:40:10,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Chan School of Public Health and a faculty member at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.

643
01:40:11,237 --> 01:40:24,449
[SPEAKER_11]: With more than 190 peer-reviewed publications, she is a policy expert in research who specializes in diet-related diseases, food insecurity, and racial inequality.

644
01:40:25,069 --> 01:40:33,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Prior to this, Dr. Bleich served in the Biden administration as the Director of Nutrition Security and Health Equity at the U.S.

645
01:40:33,477 --> 01:40:37,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service.

646
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:44,084
[SPEAKER_11]: and as the senior advisor for COVID-19 in the office of the secretary at USDA.

647
01:40:44,885 --> 01:41:00,195
[SPEAKER_11]: As a White House fellow during the Obama administration, she worked at USDA as a senior policy advisor for food, nutrition, and consumer services, and on First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move initiative.

648
01:41:00,915 --> 01:41:11,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Bleich was elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2023 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2025.

649
01:41:12,207 --> 01:41:13,809
[SPEAKER_11]: She holds a B.A.

650
01:41:13,849 --> 01:41:17,252
[SPEAKER_11]: in Psychology from Columbia and a Ph.D.

651
01:41:17,292 --> 01:41:18,894
[SPEAKER_11]: in Health Policy from Harvard.

652
01:41:20,016 --> 01:41:31,572
[SPEAKER_11]: I had the pleasure of hearing Dr. Blythe speak in 2025 when she was celebrating the commencement of a number of Harvard University Administrative Fellows program graduates.

653
01:41:32,273 --> 01:41:35,137
[SPEAKER_11]: My wife, Teresa, was among those graduates.

654
01:41:35,778 --> 01:41:40,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Needless to say, I was thrilled to be in that audience of friends, family, and supporters.

655
01:41:41,059 --> 01:41:51,722
[SPEAKER_11]: But beyond this, I was excited to hear the speech of this mentor and scholar and all that she would have to say.

656
01:41:52,202 --> 01:41:57,283
[SPEAKER_11]: When I heard and what I heard then brings me to this moment in time.

657
01:41:57,843 --> 01:42:03,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Soon, you too will know why I was on a mission to bring Dr. Bleich here today.

658
01:42:03,986 --> 01:42:09,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Without further ado, it's my pleasure to present Dr. Sarah Naomi Bleich.

659
01:42:20,296 --> 01:42:21,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon.

660
01:42:21,278 --> 01:42:34,398
[SPEAKER_00]: I was saying to Robert, so I've been in and out of this area for about 20 years, and this is by far the kindest place I have been in all those 20 years, so just thank you for welcoming me.

661
01:42:37,668 --> 01:42:44,937
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you to Terry and his wife, Teresa, for inviting me to be here with you for this Martin Luther King Day celebration.

662
01:42:45,398 --> 01:42:49,323
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank the Tufts University Office of Government and Community Relations.

663
01:42:49,763 --> 01:42:55,330
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is a pleasure to be with you all, to be in this space, and to be in community.

664
01:42:56,211 --> 01:43:01,454
[SPEAKER_00]: As you heard from Terry, my name is Dr. Sarah Bleich, and I have a couple of different hats.

665
01:43:02,074 --> 01:43:07,176
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the faculty at the School of Public Health at Harvard in the Kennedy School and still do academic research.

666
01:43:07,596 --> 01:43:14,700
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also have this Administrator hat where I am a vice provost and lead our Legacy of Slavery initiative.

667
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:33,651
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our time today, I want to reflect on the words and wisdom of Dr. Martin Luther King, to share some of the work that we are doing at Harvard, and most importantly, to connect on the theme of this year's celebration, if we don't quit.

668
01:43:34,796 --> 01:43:43,579
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I do that, I wanna begin by acknowledging several individuals whose lives, labor, and leadership anchor us today.

669
01:43:44,859 --> 01:43:53,222
[SPEAKER_00]: So earlier, about an hour ago, we posthumously honored Mr. Clarence Ed Ligon for civic engagement.

670
01:43:53,702 --> 01:43:59,644
[SPEAKER_00]: We also honored Miss Adele Chavezano for her commitment and impact to arts and culture.

671
01:44:00,570 --> 01:44:00,770
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

672
01:44:00,810 --> 01:44:05,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Stacey Clayton for her faith in action, and Ms.

673
01:44:05,053 --> 01:44:07,976
[SPEAKER_00]: Gwendolyn Lee for her enduring legacy.

674
01:44:08,996 --> 01:44:10,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Ligon, Ms.

675
01:44:10,137 --> 01:44:11,558
[SPEAKER_00]: Travisano, Ms.

676
01:44:11,598 --> 01:44:12,399
[SPEAKER_00]: Clayton, and Ms.

677
01:44:12,499 --> 01:44:30,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Lee, we thank you all again because Medford wouldn't be what it is today without your tireless dedication and commitment to preserving the history of this city and working together to ensure that it remains strong, daring not to quit.

678
01:44:30,512 --> 01:44:32,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Please join me once again in congratulating them.

679
01:44:41,445 --> 01:44:54,533
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also like to reflect back and to acknowledge someone who lived and labored in this very city hundreds of years ago, not even a mile from where we're sitting right now, Miss Belinda Sutton.

680
01:44:55,614 --> 01:45:00,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Belinda Sutton was an African woman enslaved at the royal house in Medford.

681
01:45:01,718 --> 01:45:05,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, me and my team went and visited the Royal House around this time last year.

682
01:45:06,261 --> 01:45:12,064
[SPEAKER_00]: It was winter moving into spring, and two things stood out to me on that visit.

683
01:45:13,025 --> 01:45:28,074
[SPEAKER_00]: One was when we were upstairs in the bedrooms, one of the things that Dr. Keira Singleton, who's the executive director, explained to us is that enslaved women would sleep on the feet of their enslavers to keep them warm.

684
01:45:29,347 --> 01:45:31,028
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a really cold day that day.

685
01:45:31,888 --> 01:45:42,374
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm fully dressed, my feet are kind of cold, and I'm imagining sleeping on the feet of someone else to keep their feet warm while my feet are freezing.

686
01:45:43,815 --> 01:45:49,458
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing that really stuck with me on that visit was going downstairs into the kitchen area.

687
01:45:50,379 --> 01:45:54,621
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this very fancy equivalent of a spit for making meat.

688
01:45:55,902 --> 01:46:11,581
[SPEAKER_00]: And she explained that the reason that the house had made this really big investment in this spit was because the number one cause of death for women was being burned to death by their undergarments and their clothes being set on fire from the flame.

689
01:46:12,802 --> 01:46:17,944
[SPEAKER_00]: But the purpose of that spit was not to protect and care for the enslaved.

690
01:46:18,825 --> 01:46:24,107
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of that spit was to make sure that the property of the enslavers didn't die.

691
01:46:25,147 --> 01:46:36,532
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think about those moments, and it's just, it's amazing the history of this country, and bless you, and the Royal House and Slave Quarters literally is not even a mile away from here.

692
01:46:38,233 --> 01:46:38,633
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ms.

693
01:46:38,653 --> 01:46:47,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Sutton survived the Middle Passage, years of forced labor at the royal estate, the abandonment of her enslaver during the American Revolution.

694
01:46:47,838 --> 01:46:51,760
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 1783, she did something extraordinary.

695
01:46:52,481 --> 01:47:00,025
[SPEAKER_00]: She petitioned the Massachusetts legislature for a pension from the estate that had profited from her enslavement.

696
01:47:00,665 --> 01:47:04,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Her petition was approved, and one payment was made.

697
01:47:05,628 --> 01:47:12,033
[SPEAKER_00]: But then she had many, many efforts to request the rest of the money she was owed and was unsuccessful.

698
01:47:12,573 --> 01:47:13,073
[SPEAKER_00]: But Ms.

699
01:47:13,274 --> 01:47:15,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Sutton never stopped trying.

700
01:47:16,716 --> 01:47:26,283
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the earliest documented accounts of an African woman in America plagued by slavery's chains, daring not to quit.

701
01:47:27,481 --> 01:47:42,152
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we honor the reason that we are all here today, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a man who held many titles for those that were close to him, a son, a husband, a father, a friend, a minister.

702
01:47:42,792 --> 01:47:48,276
[SPEAKER_00]: For the rest of us, he was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement, beginning when he was just in his 20s.

703
01:47:49,895 --> 01:48:04,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. King followed his grandfather and his father's footsteps, became a pastor, and preached his first sermon as a teenager in Ebenezer Baptist Church, nurturing his gift of moving and inspiring millions through public speaking.

704
01:48:06,093 --> 01:48:18,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. King was a man who saw what the future could be if people came together and stood up for what is right, for what is just, and what is true, daring not to quit.

705
01:48:19,656 --> 01:48:25,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's theme, If We Don't Quit, could be the subtitle of Dr. King's legacy.

706
01:48:26,338 --> 01:48:35,300
[SPEAKER_00]: In a powerful speech at Spelman College in 1960, he said, and this is on the crossword search that we just did, if you can't fly,

707
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:36,500
[SPEAKER_00]: then run.

708
01:48:37,361 --> 01:48:39,742
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't run, then walk.

709
01:48:40,482 --> 01:48:43,543
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't walk, then crawl.

710
01:48:44,083 --> 01:48:48,385
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward.

711
01:48:49,146 --> 01:48:52,007
[SPEAKER_00]: And move forward we must and we will.

712
01:48:52,987 --> 01:48:59,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. King's words are a powerful reminder of the importance of perseverance for progress.

713
01:48:59,529 --> 01:49:02,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are not just something that makes us feel inspired today.

714
01:49:03,330 --> 01:49:13,132
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a strategy for tomorrow and something that I hold as I move forward in the implementation work around Harvard's Legacy of Slavery initiative.

715
01:49:13,932 --> 01:49:18,076
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I come at the legacy of slavery work with a public health lens.

716
01:49:18,536 --> 01:49:29,046
[SPEAKER_00]: For the past two decades, I have dedicated my career to building evidence for policies to help communities live longer, healthier lives through academic research and translation.

717
01:49:29,066 --> 01:49:38,095
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also, as you heard from Terry, had the opportunity to serve twice in the federal government, first under the Obama administration and then in the Biden administration.

718
01:49:39,355 --> 01:49:43,977
[SPEAKER_00]: But my commitment to historically underserved communities is deeply personal.

719
01:49:44,617 --> 01:49:56,801
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew up in inner city Baltimore, and I was just telling Robert before we started that walking into this room is the first time I have felt like I am in Baltimore in Boston.

720
01:49:57,241 --> 01:50:01,803
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because of the kindness of this room, and you really are to be commended for that.

721
01:50:07,807 --> 01:50:16,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, growing up, I had my parents, and then I have a twin sister, who is my heart, and an older brother, and my parents were both public school teachers.

722
01:50:16,489 --> 01:50:19,290
[SPEAKER_00]: And my mom did special ed, my dad did high school English.

723
01:50:19,690 --> 01:50:24,972
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't go anywhere to this day in Baltimore with my father without someone saying, Mr. Bleich, Mr. Bleich.

724
01:50:25,012 --> 01:50:25,892
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows everybody.

725
01:50:26,412 --> 01:50:32,154
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing he did is that for the last part of his teaching career, he taught English

726
01:50:33,014 --> 01:50:36,918
[SPEAKER_00]: at an engineering high school, the top engineering high school in the city.

727
01:50:37,398 --> 01:50:39,881
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had to get through my dad to graduate.

728
01:50:40,241 --> 01:50:47,608
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is a lot of folklore about these engineering students learning how to write well because my dad insisted on excellence in writing.

729
01:50:49,131 --> 01:50:59,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, because my parents were public school teachers and because my mom stepped back from the workforce when we were young, my family received SNAP, which you may know as food stamps.

730
01:51:00,018 --> 01:51:01,619
[SPEAKER_00]: My family received WIC.

731
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:04,481
[SPEAKER_00]: And me and my siblings, we received school meals.

732
01:51:05,062 --> 01:51:09,105
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know firsthand the difference that those programs can make.

733
01:51:09,325 --> 01:51:18,471
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has been a pleasure and honor of my career to be able to explore how do you strengthen the public health impacts of federal nutrition assistance programs.

734
01:51:19,071 --> 01:51:27,995
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I know how powerful these programs are, personally and professionally, this current moment that we are in is especially painful.

735
01:51:28,736 --> 01:51:35,819
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you know, federal nutrition policy has undergone some of the steepest rollbacks in decades.

736
01:51:36,419 --> 01:51:42,542
[SPEAKER_00]: So last year, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or HR1, was passed.

737
01:51:43,262 --> 01:51:52,014
[SPEAKER_00]: It does many things, including reduces federal spending on SNAP by $186 billion.

738
01:51:53,155 --> 01:51:57,401
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the steepest cut in the history of the program, and it's about 20%.

739
01:51:59,343 --> 01:52:05,488
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that millions and millions of people are not going to be able to participate in that program.

740
01:52:06,489 --> 01:52:13,174
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these harms are going to be compounded by the cuts through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to Medicaid.

741
01:52:13,814 --> 01:52:19,679
[SPEAKER_00]: A trillion dollars over 10 years means 10 million people are going to lose benefits.

742
01:52:20,399 --> 01:52:24,683
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people who participate in Medicaid also participate in SNAP.

743
01:52:25,324 --> 01:52:28,407
[SPEAKER_00]: So families are facing collateral impacts.

744
01:52:29,047 --> 01:52:36,694
[SPEAKER_00]: These are likely friends, family, people that you know well, but these changes are going to affect real people in real ways.

745
01:52:37,075 --> 01:52:40,978
[SPEAKER_00]: And in moments like these, it can be hard to know where to lean in.

746
01:52:41,919 --> 01:52:48,847
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I feel that way, I return to my North Star, helping underserved communities achieve a better quality of life.

747
01:52:49,327 --> 01:52:54,994
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this season of change, that is my way of daring not to quit.

748
01:52:56,175 --> 01:53:03,303
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my work in public health was a launchpad for doing the implementation work for Harvard Legacy of Slavery Initiative.

749
01:53:04,229 --> 01:53:08,692
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a very personal moment that primed me for this position.

750
01:53:09,413 --> 01:53:18,599
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2017, on this day, on MLK, MLK celebration, I was at the JFK Library with my girls.

751
01:53:19,060 --> 01:53:22,382
[SPEAKER_00]: They were then four and six or five and seven.

752
01:53:23,463 --> 01:53:28,186
[SPEAKER_00]: And the focus of that day was the soundtrack to MLK's life.

753
01:53:29,287 --> 01:53:34,791
[SPEAKER_00]: So the MC is describing one of the songs, it was a spiritual, and he mentions slavery.

754
01:53:35,792 --> 01:53:41,576
[SPEAKER_00]: My then seven-year-old child, my oldest, turns to me and says, Mama, what's slavery?

755
01:53:42,297 --> 01:53:49,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Now before I tell you what I said, I come from a family where manners and kindness are everything.

756
01:53:49,582 --> 01:53:54,625
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're inconsiderate, if you are mean to someone else, you will get in a world of trouble.

757
01:53:55,266 --> 01:54:04,092
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a value that my parents have loudly instilled in myself and my siblings and to my children and one that I really try to reinforce.

758
01:54:05,390 --> 01:54:09,072
[SPEAKER_00]: So I turn to my seven-year-old who says to me, Mama, what's slavery?

759
01:54:09,092 --> 01:54:13,355
[SPEAKER_00]: And I explain it using seven-year-old terminology.

760
01:54:13,415 --> 01:54:14,896
[SPEAKER_00]: She might have been six, I can't remember.

761
01:54:14,916 --> 01:54:19,399
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, I watch, literally watch the wheels turning in her head.

762
01:54:19,419 --> 01:54:23,562
[SPEAKER_00]: And she looks at me and she said, Mama, that was rude.

763
01:54:24,968 --> 01:54:26,308
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you know what, honey?

764
01:54:26,548 --> 01:54:28,129
[SPEAKER_00]: It was extremely rude.

765
01:54:28,589 --> 01:54:31,149
[SPEAKER_00]: And for her, that was like a four-letter word.

766
01:54:31,730 --> 01:54:35,550
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, we were told you can't be inconsiderate, you can't be rude.

767
01:54:36,271 --> 01:54:39,371
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I often think about that conversation.

768
01:54:40,031 --> 01:54:45,333
[SPEAKER_00]: She had such moral clarity so quickly about what slavery was.

769
01:54:46,073 --> 01:54:51,334
[SPEAKER_00]: It was profoundly wrong, and it was deeply disrespectful to human dignity.

770
01:54:52,705 --> 01:55:07,017
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2022, Harvard released a report detailing the university's direct financial and intellectual ties to slavery, along with seven recommendations for how to advance reparative efforts related to that history.

771
01:55:07,897 --> 01:55:11,140
[SPEAKER_00]: And the report taught us three difficult truths.

772
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:15,403
[SPEAKER_00]: The first, Harvard has direct ties to slavery.

773
01:55:15,824 --> 01:55:21,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvard leaders, Harvard faculty, Harvard staff, enslaved people in Massachusetts and beyond.

774
01:55:22,549 --> 01:55:24,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvard has financial ties to slavery.

775
01:55:25,551 --> 01:55:30,694
[SPEAKER_00]: The university benefited from donors and investments rooted in the slave economy.

776
01:55:31,394 --> 01:55:35,196
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third is that Harvard has intellectual ties to slavery.

777
01:55:35,576 --> 01:55:41,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvard scholars helped build and legitimize the racist ideas that justified slavery and segregation.

778
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:50,222
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested to read the report, I've brought a bunch of copies with me that you're welcome to take, and it's also freely available online if you want to learn more.

779
01:55:51,162 --> 01:55:54,463
[SPEAKER_00]: One important thing to know is that the report was voluntary.

780
01:55:55,043 --> 01:56:04,185
[SPEAKER_00]: No one forced Harvard to look in the mirror, but as Dr. King taught us, the time is always right to do what is right.

781
01:56:05,225 --> 01:56:08,126
[SPEAKER_00]: The university is nearly 400 years old.

782
01:56:08,626 --> 01:56:12,307
[SPEAKER_00]: It was past time to be honest about its history.

783
01:56:13,448 --> 01:56:28,218
[SPEAKER_00]: In response, Harvard created the Legacy of Slavery Initiative with a $100 million endowment to cast light on the university's legacies of slavery and address the enduring consequences of slavery through purposeful change.

784
01:56:28,618 --> 01:56:30,460
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was asked to lead this work in 2023.

785
01:56:32,441 --> 01:56:35,743
[SPEAKER_00]: At the initiative, we have three main priorities.

786
01:56:36,323 --> 01:56:44,527
[SPEAKER_00]: One is memorializing those who were enslaved by Harvard affiliates while educating the community on the university's ties to slavery.

787
01:56:45,187 --> 01:56:50,030
[SPEAKER_00]: Another is strengthening partnerships with historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs.

788
01:56:50,650 --> 01:56:55,933
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third is identifying direct descendants of those enslaved by Harvard affiliates.

789
01:56:56,653 --> 01:57:16,017
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, the work that we are doing today is a way to honor Dr. King's legacy and many other leaders like him, like many of you in this room, who have dedicated your lives to addressing legacies of slavery and their impact on communities, never giving up and daring not to quit.

790
01:57:17,554 --> 01:57:24,680
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1962, Dr. King came to Harvard Law School, and he gave a talk, and it was called The Future of Integration.

791
01:57:25,621 --> 01:57:30,765
[SPEAKER_00]: He told the audience that to have an integrated society, we can do one of three things.

792
01:57:31,665 --> 01:57:45,336
[SPEAKER_00]: We can observe the state of our world today and live in extreme optimism, which calls us to do nothing, always thinking the best while ignoring some painful realities of what's going on around us.

793
01:57:46,397 --> 01:57:59,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, we can observe the state of our world today and live in extreme pessimism, which calls on us to digress, see all the problems, create more problems, while solving zero problems.

794
01:58:01,369 --> 01:58:17,738
[SPEAKER_00]: or we can observe the state of our world today and combine the truths of extreme optimism and extreme pessimism and be thankful for how far we have come while understanding that we have a long way to go.

795
01:58:18,578 --> 01:58:30,345
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are, 64 years later, living in a reality that reflects much of the sociopolitical environment during Dr. King's time while also demonstrating progress

796
01:58:31,385 --> 01:58:32,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet, we have a long way to go.

797
01:58:32,868 --> 01:58:38,639
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can only get there together if we dare not to quit.

798
01:58:39,930 --> 01:58:46,555
[SPEAKER_00]: At Harvard, we're not quitting and remain committed to the implementation work at the Harvard Legacy of Slavery Initiative.

799
01:58:47,056 --> 01:59:02,928
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the ways we live out this commitment are providing individuals and groups with an introduction to what slavery looked like in the 17th, 18th, and 19th century New England, and how Harvard played a major role in it through our guided and self-guided tour experiences.

800
01:59:03,348 --> 01:59:06,670
[SPEAKER_00]: We would love to welcome you all on a guided tour this spring.

801
01:59:06,770 --> 01:59:08,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to reach out and we can set that up.

802
01:59:09,031 --> 01:59:13,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the self-guided option is always available and you can take it at any time that's convenient for you.

803
01:59:14,414 --> 01:59:24,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Many who participate in these tours are stunned that this history is in our backyard and that slavery wasn't something that only happened in the South.

804
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:30,982
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way Harvard lives out its commitment is through partnerships with HBCUs.

805
01:59:31,443 --> 01:59:36,305
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we are currently in the third year of offering a program called the Du Bois Scholars Program.

806
01:59:36,685 --> 01:59:42,347
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a summer research internship for rising juniors and seniors at research-intensive HBCUs.

807
01:59:42,387 --> 01:59:44,548
[SPEAKER_00]: We partner with 21 different institutions.

808
01:59:45,289 --> 01:59:52,632
[SPEAKER_00]: And past participants have impacted Harvard through planting seeds that inspire further research by Harvard faculty members,

809
01:59:53,512 --> 02:00:02,234
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm proud that Harvard gets to help participants to deepen their research skills and develop a strong network of peers through their involvement with the program.

810
02:00:02,914 --> 02:00:07,395
[SPEAKER_00]: This past fall, I had a focus group with a number of the faculty that participated.

811
02:00:08,296 --> 02:00:22,119
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them, who's been a faculty member for the past two summers, said that in his 26 years of being on the faculty at Harvard Medical School, being a mentor in this program is the most rewarding thing that he's done.

812
02:00:23,479 --> 02:00:36,566
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we at Harvard are so privileged to have these amazing fellows from HBCUs come with their confidence, with their brilliance, with their energy, with their excitement, and honestly make Harvard a better place.

813
02:00:37,186 --> 02:00:40,368
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a space where we're probably gaining more than we're giving.

814
02:00:41,428 --> 02:00:47,813
[SPEAKER_00]: The last example I'll leave you with is that we're currently working alongside an organization called American Ancestors.

815
02:00:48,233 --> 02:01:00,523
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the oldest genealogical organization in the country, and we're working with them to identify Harvard leaders, Harvard faculty and staff who enslaved people, and the descendants of those who were enslaved.

816
02:01:01,263 --> 02:01:06,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it will take multiple years to complete, this work is vital and Harvard remains committed.

817
02:01:07,348 --> 02:01:16,776
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to learn more about the implementation work, I've brought along some one-pagers which describe it and there are QR codes in there that you can scan to learn about things in more detail.

818
02:01:18,410 --> 02:01:34,917
[SPEAKER_00]: During times when this work and the values that it represents are being questioned, Dr. King's legacy continually inspires me to keep leading my team to take concrete steps toward Harvard reckoning with the enduring consequences of slavery.

819
02:01:35,697 --> 02:01:43,460
[SPEAKER_00]: The work that we do has real impact on real lives, and we can only do it in community with others.

820
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:51,065
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't quit on amplifying history, even when that history is painful.

821
02:01:52,106 --> 02:02:00,493
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't quit on investing in our communities through civic engagement, arts and culture, faith in action, and legacy building.

822
02:02:01,413 --> 02:02:15,536
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't quit on building institutions that are accountable, not just prestigious, if we don't quit on each other across every line of difference, then the work of Ms.

823
02:02:15,616 --> 02:02:28,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Belinda Sutton with her petition, the work Dr. King carried through the Civil Rights Movement, and the work that all of you are doing here in Medford will continue to move us towards a more just society.

824
02:02:29,479 --> 02:02:39,190
[SPEAKER_00]: And even when it feels like we're swimming upstream, which is how this moment feels to me, we will make progress and eventually draw closer to the promised land.

825
02:02:39,971 --> 02:02:41,873
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot quit.

826
02:02:43,134 --> 02:02:45,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me close with a simple invitation.

827
02:02:46,758 --> 02:02:54,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Dare not to quit on yourself, on what you built, on what your community built, or on one another.

828
02:02:54,805 --> 02:03:04,253
[SPEAKER_00]: We need each other to build a brighter future in which generations can thrive and in turn help light the way for those who follow.

829
02:03:05,234 --> 02:03:06,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me in your space.

830
02:03:29,934 --> 02:03:38,458
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm smiling from ear to ear, because as you probably do, I love it when a plan comes together.

831
02:03:40,059 --> 02:03:40,939
[SPEAKER_11]: What I heard then.

832
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:47,711
[SPEAKER_11]: is equivalent in so many ways to what I heard today.

833
02:03:49,211 --> 02:03:51,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Sarah, that was absolutely amazing.

834
02:03:52,552 --> 02:03:58,773
[SPEAKER_11]: And you crystallized everything that we wanted to bring to our audience today.

835
02:03:59,593 --> 02:04:07,535
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want you all to give yourselves a round of applause, because you've been a great audience in braving the elements to join us today.

836
02:04:14,743 --> 02:04:28,707
[SPEAKER_11]: So as we move closer to the close of our program, I would be remiss in this gathering, and I don't think it would be complete if we didn't link arms and sing together.

837
02:04:28,767 --> 02:04:35,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Martin Luther King was a great lover of the gospel, but also of gospel music.

838
02:04:35,709 --> 02:04:44,252
[SPEAKER_11]: And here to present us in another of Dr. King's favorite spirituals, We Shall Overcome, is once again the wonderful Athene Wilson.

839
02:04:53,737 --> 02:05:01,820
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, so if we can stand and make this declaration with music as we sing We Shall Overcome.

840
02:05:05,601 --> 02:05:08,482
[SPEAKER_13]: We shall overcome.

841
02:05:08,602 --> 02:05:12,504
[SPEAKER_13]: We shall overcome.

842
02:05:12,524 --> 02:05:17,266
[SPEAKER_13]: We shall overcome.

843
02:05:24,582 --> 02:05:40,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe.

844
02:05:42,841 --> 02:05:50,285
[SPEAKER_13]: We shall overcome someday.

845
02:05:50,325 --> 02:05:57,288
[SPEAKER_13]: If we take it further, we shall live in peace.

846
02:05:58,049 --> 02:06:03,511
[SPEAKER_13]: We shall live in peace.

847
02:06:04,332 --> 02:06:07,233
[SPEAKER_13]: We shall live in peace.

848
02:06:09,065 --> 02:06:36,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Someday, oh, deep in my heart, I do believe we shall live in peace one day.

849
02:06:36,492 --> 02:06:37,692
[SPEAKER_13]: One more time, one more thing.

850
02:06:38,511 --> 02:06:42,475
[SPEAKER_13]: We are not afraid.

851
02:06:42,715 --> 02:06:43,796
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not afraid.

852
02:06:44,436 --> 02:06:47,939
[SPEAKER_13]: We are not afraid.

853
02:06:47,979 --> 02:06:48,960
[SPEAKER_13]: You believe it, right?

854
02:06:49,521 --> 02:06:50,481
[SPEAKER_13]: We are not afraid.

855
02:06:50,642 --> 02:06:54,785
[SPEAKER_13]: We are not afraid today.

856
02:06:54,805 --> 02:06:55,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Today.

857
02:07:00,069 --> 02:07:19,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, so deep in my heart, I do believe we will overcome, that we shall overcome someday.

858
02:07:26,440 --> 02:07:26,820
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

859
02:07:26,941 --> 02:07:27,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

860
02:07:30,004 --> 02:07:32,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Give yourselves a big hand, big hand.

861
02:07:32,647 --> 02:07:36,050
[SPEAKER_13]: We shall overcome today.

862
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:39,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Glory to God.

863
02:07:39,253 --> 02:07:39,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

864
02:07:40,294 --> 02:07:40,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

865
02:07:40,895 --> 02:07:41,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

866
02:07:41,396 --> 02:07:41,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

867
02:07:42,377 --> 02:07:44,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Athene, so much.

868
02:07:48,222 --> 02:07:51,604
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, like I said, friends and allies.

869
02:07:53,025 --> 02:07:59,208
[SPEAKER_11]: And from one important tradition to the next, I would like to bring another friend front and center.

870
02:08:00,028 --> 02:08:15,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Jill Harvey is the chief equity officer of the Mass Municipal Association and previously served as the inaugural director of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the Division of Health and Human Services for the town of Arlington.

871
02:08:17,237 --> 02:08:26,182
[SPEAKER_11]: prior to obtaining a master's in public affairs from Brown, her bachelor's in anthropology in 2013.

872
02:08:27,163 --> 02:08:27,463
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

873
02:08:28,744 --> 02:08:31,645
[SPEAKER_11]: And she obtained her bachelor's in anthropology in 2013.

874
02:08:31,765 --> 02:08:43,352
[SPEAKER_11]: It was during her undergraduate career that she stepped into the leadership role, leading the Black Student Union, and became a lifelong advocate for community, equity, and inclusiveness.

875
02:08:43,892 --> 02:08:52,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Jill has been a member of the Mystic Valley branch NAACP since 2020 and became its president in 2022.

876
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:55,702
[SPEAKER_11]: I have great admiration for this woman.

877
02:08:55,762 --> 02:08:59,325
[SPEAKER_11]: She is both persistent and determined to make a difference.

878
02:08:59,886 --> 02:09:11,215
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've asked her to deliver our charge as we leave this gathering to continue on in this kindred journey to active commitment in Medford and beyond.

879
02:09:11,355 --> 02:09:11,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Jill Harvey.

880
02:09:27,982 --> 02:09:28,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello?

881
02:09:29,184 --> 02:09:29,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello?

882
02:09:29,644 --> 02:09:29,765
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

883
02:09:29,805 --> 02:09:31,547
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

884
02:09:31,728 --> 02:09:32,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Terry.

885
02:09:36,635 --> 02:09:38,017
[SPEAKER_07]: The charge for this day.

886
02:09:39,918 --> 02:09:46,782
[SPEAKER_07]: So I believe you all came here today because you care about the things that Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

887
02:09:46,822 --> 02:09:50,504
[SPEAKER_07]: cared about throughout his historic and courageous life.

888
02:09:51,785 --> 02:09:59,229
[SPEAKER_07]: You care about people, your family, your friends, your neighbors, even those who you do not know personally.

889
02:10:00,629 --> 02:10:05,372
[SPEAKER_07]: You believe that each and every person has rights that should not be infringed upon.

890
02:10:06,978 --> 02:10:15,526
[SPEAKER_07]: equal protection under the law, voting rights, equity and access in housing, employment, education, and health care.

891
02:10:16,406 --> 02:10:19,189
[SPEAKER_07]: These are all the things that you care about and believe in.

892
02:10:20,958 --> 02:10:43,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully throughout our time together, you were able to soak in and absorb the messages of our speakers, that you engaged in fruitful conversations with your neighbors and table mates, and that you were present for the last few hours, taking a pause and respite from the encompassing chaos that somehow has become our new normal.

893
02:10:46,038 --> 02:10:58,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been asked to reshape the positive and communal energy of our time together into a charge for moving forward as one, as one beloved community.

894
02:10:59,611 --> 02:11:11,222
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm honored and humbled to do so, but I am resolute about making the best of the few moments I have to share something of value as we leave today's proceedings.

895
02:11:13,183 --> 02:11:23,827
[SPEAKER_07]: There are three key principles I believe Dr. King would have wanted us to focus on at this difficult, challenging, and what feels like backwards-moving time.

896
02:11:25,548 --> 02:11:38,593
[SPEAKER_07]: First, I believe that Dr. King would have beseeched us to look inward, to engage in self-awareness and acknowledge the role each and every one of us hold in perpetuating injustice.

897
02:11:39,614 --> 02:11:46,135
[SPEAKER_07]: We each play a part in upholding oppressive systems and understanding where we are situated is key.

898
02:11:47,955 --> 02:12:01,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Second, I think that Dr. King would have reminded us that the challenges and setbacks to progress are part of the normal process of development and not to be discouraged or hopeless.

899
02:12:02,118 --> 02:12:14,281
[SPEAKER_07]: He told us that the line of progress is never straight for a period of movement may follow a straight line and then it encounters obstacles and the path bends.

900
02:12:15,928 --> 02:12:21,131
[SPEAKER_07]: This means that we cannot lose faith when we face setbacks in seeking peace and equity for all.

901
02:12:22,872 --> 02:12:29,656
[SPEAKER_07]: And lastly, Dr. King would have wanted us to recognize that the path forward is choosing community.

902
02:12:30,737 --> 02:12:34,819
[SPEAKER_07]: In his final book before his assassination, Where Do We Go From Here?

903
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:43,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Choosing Community Over Chaos, it is evident that choosing community and love for one another is the only way forward.

904
02:12:44,525 --> 02:12:48,649
[SPEAKER_07]: So your charge beyond this afternoon, when you leave here today, is threefold.

905
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:53,593
[SPEAKER_07]: First, start to get comfortable with being uncomfortable.

906
02:12:54,814 --> 02:13:05,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Leaning into self-reflection and intentionally seeking to learn about yourself and others, being culture, religion, anyone who's different from us.

907
02:13:05,823 --> 02:13:10,127
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be difficult and it can be uncomfortable, but you need to lean into that.

908
02:13:11,635 --> 02:13:21,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Real engagement and relationship building humanizes people, and it helps us to see that individuals have much more in common despite noted differences.

909
02:13:23,168 --> 02:13:27,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I encourage each of you to make an effort to talk to your neighbors.

910
02:13:28,033 --> 02:13:32,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Get to know people who live near you if you don't know them already.

911
02:13:34,136 --> 02:13:43,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Strike up a conversation with a stranger, in a coffee shop, at the grocery store, at a park, or just while you're waiting by the bus, because you know the buses be late.

912
02:13:45,739 --> 02:13:52,241
[SPEAKER_07]: But human-to-human interaction goes a long way, and it often has a trickle-down effect.

913
02:13:52,481 --> 02:13:58,442
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't know how a simple hello or a smile can positively impact someone's day.

914
02:14:02,196 --> 02:14:06,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Let go of despair and allow your faith to lead you.

915
02:14:07,501 --> 02:14:14,247
[SPEAKER_07]: King said, a final victory is an accumulation of many short-term encounters.

916
02:14:15,408 --> 02:14:23,075
[SPEAKER_07]: And right now, we are in the midst of a counter-revolution to the progress we've made in this country in advancing human and civil rights.

917
02:14:24,517 --> 02:14:27,840
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are moving through that cyclical process of progress.

918
02:14:29,426 --> 02:14:40,512
[SPEAKER_07]: It's much easier to give in and buckle under the pressure, but I implore you to dig deep and tap into your faith and encourage others to do so as well.

919
02:14:41,592 --> 02:14:50,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever notion of the divine might be for you as an individual and for your neighbors, tap into it and keep it at the forefront of all that you do.

920
02:14:53,003 --> 02:14:56,144
[SPEAKER_07]: And finally, choose community over chaos.

921
02:14:57,304 --> 02:15:14,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Do what is necessary to ensure that every individual, despite their race, sex, gender identity, religion, socioeconomic status, any differing characteristic, that every single individual has what they need to thrive.

922
02:15:14,629 --> 02:15:16,710
[SPEAKER_07]: That is at the core of what equity is.

923
02:15:18,281 --> 02:15:32,618
[SPEAKER_07]: actively choose to prioritize equity, which requires a commitment to understanding that the structures and systems we currently have perpetuate disparities in every facet of life and that they must change.

924
02:15:33,699 --> 02:15:38,525
[SPEAKER_07]: And accepting that change will be hard, it's okay to make that choice.

925
02:15:40,068 --> 02:15:50,235
[SPEAKER_07]: In all that you do, consider how it will impact not just you, but others, your family, your friends, your neighbors, and those you do not know and might not ever meet.

926
02:15:52,005 --> 02:15:59,812
[SPEAKER_07]: As we depart here today, let's be mindful of our duty to live out the promise of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'

927
02:15:59,792 --> 02:16:02,634
[SPEAKER_07]: 's sacred trust and his willing sacrifice.

928
02:16:03,855 --> 02:16:19,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Gathering together our individual pieces of his dream can lead to something truly special, or as Dr. King so eloquently stated, not everybody can be famous, but everybody can be great, because greatness is determined by service.

929
02:16:20,689 --> 02:16:29,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all for being here today, and I hope that you leave here reinvigorated, determined to serve, and remembering not to quit.

930
02:16:49,002 --> 02:16:50,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, wow.

931
02:16:53,143 --> 02:16:56,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Medford, that's a good day's work.

932
02:16:57,484 --> 02:17:03,465
[SPEAKER_11]: We've discussed, we've dined, we've danced, we've sang, we've listened, and we've learned.

933
02:17:04,165 --> 02:17:07,646
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it's exactly what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

934
02:17:08,126 --> 02:17:11,007
[SPEAKER_11]: wanted in us as we are together today.

935
02:17:11,907 --> 02:17:19,272
[SPEAKER_11]: I pray that there's no COVID, no conflict, and no lack of commitment in the room, even as we're leaving.

936
02:17:19,793 --> 02:17:29,019
[SPEAKER_11]: So as things wrap up, I'm going to cede the floor to Lisa M. Crossman, the executive director of the West Medford Community Center, to acknowledge and thank some folks.

937
02:17:29,099 --> 02:17:31,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Please show your love for Lisa.

938
02:17:39,007 --> 02:17:39,387
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

939
02:17:44,917 --> 02:17:46,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, thank you.

940
02:17:47,780 --> 02:17:49,221
[SPEAKER_10]: So I won't keep you long.

941
02:17:49,241 --> 02:17:51,444
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to say a few things.

942
02:17:52,765 --> 02:17:57,851
[SPEAKER_10]: As we come to a close, I want to pause and say thank you because today did not happen by accident.

943
02:17:58,131 --> 02:17:59,793
[SPEAKER_10]: It happened because people showed up.

944
02:18:00,293 --> 02:18:03,414
[SPEAKER_10]: with care, commitment, and love for this community.

945
02:18:04,475 --> 02:18:17,859
[SPEAKER_10]: This year's theme, If We Don't Quit, reminds us that progress is sustained by perseverance, that the work of justice and love continues when we choose to stay engaged, even when the road is hard.

946
02:18:18,879 --> 02:18:21,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Today is a testament to that spirit.

947
02:18:22,181 --> 02:18:25,662
[SPEAKER_10]: First, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to Terry Carter.

948
02:18:25,682 --> 02:18:27,843
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

949
02:18:27,863 --> 02:18:28,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Give it up, give it up, give it up.

950
02:18:31,953 --> 02:18:37,698
[SPEAKER_10]: whose vision and leadership and countless hours made today's celebration possible.

951
02:18:38,298 --> 02:18:43,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Terry, thank you for carrying forward this event with such heart and excellence.

952
02:18:45,224 --> 02:18:52,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you to our guest speaker, Dr. Sarah Naomi, for sharing your wisdom, insight, and inspiration with us today.

953
02:18:52,290 --> 02:18:55,773
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to, oh, go ahead, y'all give it up.

954
02:18:55,793 --> 02:18:56,514
[SPEAKER_10]: She deserves that.

955
02:19:00,026 --> 02:19:08,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to recognize their incredible event setup and support team of Stacey, Charmaine, Pam, Melinda, and Ketley.

956
02:19:08,351 --> 02:19:09,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

957
02:19:15,439 --> 02:19:20,721
[SPEAKER_10]: They ensured everything came together beautifully with very little time this morning.

958
02:19:21,141 --> 02:19:23,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Your work behind the scenes makes moments like this shine.

959
02:19:25,003 --> 02:19:41,769
[SPEAKER_10]: To our board of directors, Reverend Kilpatrick, Teta DeRosa, Melinda Regan, Michael Bergman, Stephen McCullough, Mario Reed, Jarrett Lovett, Phil Davis, and Brian Collins, thank you for your steady support, leadership, and belief in the mission of the West Medford Community Center.

960
02:19:43,483 --> 02:19:43,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

961
02:19:45,051 --> 02:19:45,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Full board.

962
02:19:48,423 --> 02:20:06,378
[SPEAKER_10]: We're deeply grateful to the Tufts University Office of Government and Community Relations for the room and their support in getting everything together, Rocco DiRico for driving that effort forward, the Mystic Valley branch of the NAACP, and to everyone in this room who donated.

963
02:20:06,998 --> 02:20:13,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Your financial support makes it possible for this celebration to remain free and accessible to everyone, and for that, we thank you.

964
02:20:19,862 --> 02:20:23,884
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll close with words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

965
02:20:23,944 --> 02:20:26,325
[SPEAKER_10]: who reminded us why gatherings like this matter.

966
02:20:27,125 --> 02:20:30,226
[SPEAKER_10]: The end is the creation of the beloved community.

967
02:20:31,047 --> 02:20:38,290
[SPEAKER_10]: May we leave here today carrying forward that vision in our words, our actions, our care for one another.

968
02:20:39,010 --> 02:20:41,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you and travel safely home.

969
02:20:49,430 --> 02:20:49,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

970
02:20:50,891 --> 02:20:51,331
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

971
02:20:52,732 --> 02:21:02,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, profound appreciation to Tufts' own Leah Bedro and the excellent assistance of IT guru Guillermo.

972
02:21:02,996 --> 02:21:04,297
[SPEAKER_11]: He's back in the corner there.

973
02:21:09,088 --> 02:21:14,630
[SPEAKER_11]: And as Dr. Sarah said, everybody can be great because anybody can serve.

974
02:21:15,030 --> 02:21:17,431
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to have a college degree to serve.

975
02:21:17,791 --> 02:21:20,732
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to make your subject and verb agree to serve.

976
02:21:21,052 --> 02:21:25,453
[SPEAKER_11]: You only need to have a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love.

977
02:21:26,134 --> 02:21:31,975
[SPEAKER_11]: As we leave this place, let's allow our hearts to be full of grace and our souls generated by love.

978
02:21:32,456 --> 02:21:33,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you and God bless you.

979
02:21:35,016 --> 02:21:35,336
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

980
02:21:36,797 --> 02:21:36,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

981
02:21:38,922 --> 02:21:43,584
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing is we don't have enough for everybody, but it is online.

982
02:21:43,964 --> 02:21:52,328
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you'd like a copy of the book about Harvard's initiative on slavery, you can come up and see us at the table over here.

983
02:21:52,348 --> 02:21:56,570
[SPEAKER_11]: I also have books of poetry if anybody's interested.

984
02:21:56,910 --> 02:21:59,471
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're over here, Separation of Church and State.
