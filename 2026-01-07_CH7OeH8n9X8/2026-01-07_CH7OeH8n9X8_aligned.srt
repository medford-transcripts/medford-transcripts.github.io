1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:06,740
Right.

2
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:09,662
Thanks, everyone, for joining us.

3
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:21,428
I see we're still assembling here just a little bit, but I will start with introductions because we have a lot of people here that are excited to talk about this project and a lot of information to share.

4
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:26,810
And we are recording, so we will be posting this recording.

5
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:30,412
It's being streamed live to YouTube and will be available there.

6
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:35,035
And we'll make sure that it's on our website for the project as well.

7
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:39,337
so people can watch this at any time that works for them.

8
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:41,197
My name is Jenny Graham.

9
00:00:41,217 --> 00:00:53,983
I am the vice chair of the school committee and it is my excited honor to also be the chair of the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee.

10
00:00:55,742 --> 00:01:11,255
The committee formed almost a couple of years ago now with a mission to work in partnership with the Massachusetts School Building Authority to explore the future of Medford High School.

11
00:01:11,895 --> 00:01:23,365
So we're going to talk tonight about a whole variety of things, including some of the history of how we have gotten to where we are, as well as some of the things that we're seeing and finding in our exploratory phases.

12
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:30,022
And then we'll wrap up with how you all can be involved in this project.

13
00:01:31,303 --> 00:01:34,585
Along the way, there is a Q&A feature in the webinar.

14
00:01:34,705 --> 00:01:38,487
If you have questions you'd like us to field, please feel free to pop them in there.

15
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:45,832
If we have time at the end, we will probably field some number of them, but we'll also use those questions as we go forward.

16
00:01:47,293 --> 00:01:54,399
to fill out the Q&A section FAQs on our website and make sure that we're being responsive to all of those questions as they come up.

17
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,842
So thank you all for joining us.

18
00:01:57,682 --> 00:02:04,609
We're all really excited for this project, obviously, but also really excited to be moving into this phase.

19
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:09,753
So I'm going to start by introducing some members of the project team.

20
00:02:09,893 --> 00:02:11,435
So Matt, if you could go to the next slide.

21
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:19,094
I wanted to give a special shout out to our Medford Connects community engagement team.

22
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:29,661
You will be seeing these folks, so we wanted to give you their picture in coming meetings, and they will be supporting us in some of our live and

23
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:40,804
Zoom input sessions where we'll be collecting feedback to make sure that translation services are available in the languages that Medford speaks.

24
00:02:41,304 --> 00:02:43,505
So I just wanted to say welcome.

25
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:53,887
They're here today to gather information and be able to be responsive to questions from the communities that they work with on a regular basis and just to get ready to be on this journey with us.

26
00:02:53,927 --> 00:02:56,348
So thank you all so much for being here.

27
00:02:57,268 --> 00:03:02,030
And if you see any of these folks out and about, please thank them for all their good work for Medford.

28
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:07,913
We're going to get started with some introductions.

29
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:11,134
As I mentioned, we'll talk about the process and the schedule.

30
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,519
Why are we doing this?

31
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:19,503
I think everyone has an idea of why we are doing this if you're here, but we'll talk a little bit about that.

32
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:30,291
And then we'll talk about some of the work we're doing in this feasibility study phase around studying our educational needs as well as the physical conditions of the site.

33
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:32,793
Those are two important elements, and we'll talk about why.

34
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:42,261
And then, like I said, we'll wrap up with some talk about how we want to hear from you at various points in this process.

35
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:50,905
And if time allows, we'll answer some questions, and then we will wrap up and post this for everyone to view in future.

36
00:03:54,947 --> 00:03:59,510
I will start by introducing the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee.

37
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:06,733
The school committee, under its authority, appointed a 25-member committee in April 2023, so we're coming up on

38
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:12,683
you know, two and a half years actually.

39
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:18,059
maybe 2024, but we might have a typo there.

40
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:43,773
But what we set out to do was create a committee that is comprised of the right mix of people from across a lot of different specialties, both within our schools, within our city government, across some elected officials, and of community members who have particular skills and talents that we thought would make a well-rounded team.

41
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:59,978
And as we did that, we had 110 applications for this 25-member committee on top of all of the appointed people who are required by the MSBA, like the mayor and the superintendent and others.

42
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:09,602
This is a list of who our current members are, both voting and non-voting, as well as a nod to some of the folks who have served in various capacities on the committee.

43
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,711
Um, over the initial stages, um, and have moved on for any number of reasons.

44
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:18,312
Um, but we thank them for their input and their support as well.

45
00:05:18,392 --> 00:05:26,514
So we're really, this, this team has been working really hard to move through the, I'll call it the paperwork phase of this process.

46
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:36,116
Um, and to get onto the things where, um, there's a lot to talk about, um, and a lot of, um, information to share with all, with the community, as well as.

47
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:40,580
to hear from the community about the future of this building.

48
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:49,405
So I am going to turn it over on the next slide and introduce our owner's project manager.

49
00:05:49,545 --> 00:05:54,207
So through a competitive bidding process, we selected Leftfield.

50
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:56,869
They are an owner's project manager.

51
00:05:57,731 --> 00:05:59,372
and they do school.

52
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:03,433
That is their specialty and their core, and we're so delighted to have them.

53
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:11,857
So I'm going to turn it over to Matt to introduce his team, and then we'll talk to our architects and our designers.

54
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:13,283
Great.

55
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:13,803
Thank you, Jenny.

56
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:15,304
Good evening, everyone.

57
00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:17,204
Thanks for tuning in here.

58
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,565
A quick introduction of the left field team.

59
00:06:19,905 --> 00:06:21,085
My name is Matthew Galeno.

60
00:06:21,105 --> 00:06:29,347
I am one of the project managers and the day-to-day contact working very closely with the city of Medford and Medford High School.

61
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:32,308
Jennifer Carlson is our project director.

62
00:06:33,288 --> 00:06:35,468
Linda Laporto is our director of interiors.

63
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:40,590
She helps a lot behind the scenes doing a lot of website updates.

64
00:06:43,258 --> 00:06:48,462
and really supporting Jen and I in our daily, you know, our day-to-day communications.

65
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:51,024
Adele Sands is our education liaison.

66
00:06:51,084 --> 00:06:56,969
She was a superintendent of schools at a CTE school as well.

67
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,052
So she is very familiar with this process.

68
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:06,636
She went through a building project of her own when she was in the superintendent's role.

69
00:07:07,457 --> 00:07:11,040
So she's been working very closely with the superintendent of Medford.

70
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:14,237
Lynn Stapleton is our project advisor.

71
00:07:14,277 --> 00:07:25,785
She's a very experienced OPM in Massachusetts, is one of the first owner project managers to work with the MSBA back when they were first created in the early 2000s.

72
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:29,707
And then Jay Faxon, I just wanted to highlight him here.

73
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:31,889
He's an MEP expert.

74
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:35,431
He has over 50 years in experience in the field.

75
00:07:36,392 --> 00:07:40,835
And I just wanted to kind of highlight this, that, you know, left field's approach is a very holistic approach.

76
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:49,534
We're not just project managers, we bring a lot of different expertise to the project to really assist the communities that we work in.

77
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:54,875
So with that, I'll hand it over to Matt Rice to introduce the SMMA team.

78
00:07:54,935 --> 00:08:01,517
All right, I think I actually may let Helen start off and then I'll jump in.

79
00:08:02,497 --> 00:08:02,897
Sure.

80
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,099
Good evening, everyone.

81
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:13,997
Helen Fantini, I'm a project manager with SMMA and we do have both Matt Rice, principal in charge here this evening, as well as Rosemary Park.

82
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:17,049
educational planner, also an architect.

83
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:24,415
And these are just a few more phases on our team that are very active in these early phases of the project.

84
00:08:24,776 --> 00:08:41,230
This team is going to bloom into approaching 100 or so folks once we get into construction documentation, but right now we need to help you figure out what the best approach to a project here in Medford is for this really

85
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:43,669
ready to get going communities.

86
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:46,191
So Michael Pardek is our design architect.

87
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:48,733
Mike Parolo is a consultant to us.

88
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:56,878
He's an educational planner and has been leading the visioning outreach and work with the district and the community.

89
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,580
Erin Prestilio, a civil engineer.

90
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,702
Kate Took with agency, a landscape architect.

91
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:06,445
Emily Ehlers, HVAC engineer, along with

92
00:09:07,622 --> 00:09:17,107
electrical, plumbing, engineers, she's sort of our liaison, and then Martine Dion is also supporting our work as our sustainability director.

93
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:19,548
Next.

94
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,702
Okay, we're gonna talk a little bit about process and schedule.

95
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:33,605
I'm gonna talk about some of the very early phases of this project.

96
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:38,348
And then I'm gonna turn it over to Matt to talk about this feasibility phase that we're in right now.

97
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:49,175
So just by way of a little history, Bedford High was built in 1970 and a renovation of our science labs happened in 2015.

98
00:09:49,536 --> 00:09:52,958
So that is more than a decade old at this point.

99
00:09:55,306 --> 00:10:18,304
Before 2022, Medford had been working in multiple go-arounds to be admitted or accepted or invited to the Massachusetts School Building Authorities Program that would allow us to work in partnership with the MSBA to substantially renovate or rebuild Medford High School.

100
00:10:18,924 --> 00:10:35,970
Those pre-2022 bids were not successful, and I think as we moved into 2022, we took a different approach to that application, and we really dug deep into a handful of things.

101
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:42,232
One was the educational limitations that the current building provides, as well as some of the

102
00:10:43,572 --> 00:10:50,540
the ongoing maintenance issues that were increasing in scope and scale as the building ages.

103
00:10:52,022 --> 00:11:04,356
I'm not a building expert myself, but what I'm told is that this is not at all unusual for buildings built in the 1970s to be at this point of really thinking through the future of the building at this point in time.

104
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:15,769
Back in 2022, we were, because of our sort of renewed approach to submitting our application, we were a finalist to the core program.

105
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,353
If you all remember 2022, construction costs went through the roof.

106
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:39,387
Inflation was very, very high, and the MSBA, because of its budget constraints, was only able to let in a fraction of maybe, say, 60 or 70 percent of the projects, the core projects like ours, that they normally would in a year.

107
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:47,730
That was also the year where they halted their accelerated repair program that did things like roof replacement stores and windows.

108
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,852
So that budget year was rough sort of all around.

109
00:11:52,872 --> 00:12:02,214
I think I remember it being rough here too, because they all feel a little bit rough when you're trying to advocate for a lot of money from a finite resource.

110
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,195
But I think the MSBA also felt that.

111
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:07,916
So we did not proceed in 2022.

112
00:12:08,096 --> 00:12:10,297
So we took all that feedback.

113
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:15,259
And in 2023, we submitted an application again.

114
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,900
And that application, we again were a finalist.

115
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,161
And then in December of 2023, we were invited to the MSBA's core program.

116
00:12:23,882 --> 00:12:33,405
And what that means is we will partner with the MSBA through a process that they have designed because it works to build

117
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:37,549
something different here than what we see today.

118
00:12:38,451 --> 00:12:44,099
And one of the things that to me is the hallmark of the MSBA's process to me, there's two big things.

119
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:51,089
One is that they really push districts and communities to be thoughtful about

120
00:12:51,565 --> 00:13:03,468
what they're trying to accomplish in the building and what kind of a building they require in order to accomplish those goals before we get into the conversation of like, where does the building go?

121
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:05,448
And is it three stories or four stories?

122
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:11,009
So they really encourage a very methodical approach that goes from one step to the next.

123
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:14,370
So we were invited to the program for that reason.

124
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:23,155
Most exciting reason to be invited to the core program is that the state will share in the cost of the program with grant funding to Medford.

125
00:13:24,216 --> 00:13:28,578
Our reimbursement rate, we're not going to talk a lot about that is is over 50%.

126
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:34,042
There's a lot of intricate details there that we will talk about in future meetings, but for tonight.

127
00:13:35,142 --> 00:13:40,948
just for you all to know, the big draw of being part of this program is—are those two things.

128
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:54,640
One is the, like, proven, tested approach that makes sure that education is better than we started with, and the substantial state grant that comes with—that comes with participation in their program.

129
00:13:56,401 --> 00:14:05,063
So between 2023 and 2025, there was a whole bunch of work happening on our side, which I'll talk about in just a second.

130
00:14:05,163 --> 00:14:11,665
And then in 2025, what kicked off was really the feasibility—the feasibility study phase.

131
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:15,045
So if you can go to the next slide, I'll move quickly.

132
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:18,126
In—so in April 2024, the—

133
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:34,692
We started our eligibility period and it was, I'm sorry, April 2023, we submitted a statement of interest.

134
00:14:35,153 --> 00:14:37,156
The board approved us in December of 2023.

135
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,204
And then in May of 2024, we started what was called the eligibility period.

136
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:47,867
And in this period, we had to do a whole number of things.

137
00:14:47,907 --> 00:14:52,391
We had to provide them an initial understanding of the space in the building.

138
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:56,434
We had to also outline our overarching goals for education.

139
00:14:57,174 --> 00:15:06,401
And we had to partner with the MSBA to agree on the number of students that we were going to build a building to house.

140
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:22,160
And that enrollment study was really informative, very detailed, and looked at everything from what is our historical enrollment over the last 10 or 15 years to what are we seeing in terms of trends in our enrollment.

141
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:28,263
To how do we expect the population of our city to change in the coming years?

142
00:15:29,383 --> 00:15:36,127
And that's through looking at real data around permitted projects, planned projects, et cetera.

143
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:46,312
And so, through through all of that, we provide all that we provided all that detail and the initial the initial enrollment number.

144
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:53,178
That came out of the assessment was 1200, which is about what our student population is today.

145
00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:05,410
And then we worked together to understand, like, what was what was different and unique about Medford that made that that sort of, like, program assessment need to shift a little bit.

146
00:16:06,011 --> 00:16:09,855
And we worked closely with folks at city hall and planning and development.

147
00:16:10,775 --> 00:16:23,283
And we ultimately agreed with the MSBA that we would be building a building for our nine to 12 students set at an enrollment, a target enrollment of 1,395 students.

148
00:16:23,343 --> 00:16:39,052
So some room to grow there and, you know, projection wise, we're not expected to hit that 1,395 for some time, but having the space and the agreement that Medford is a community that's growing is a really important

149
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:44,197
sort of linchpin in how we plan to support our schools going forward.

150
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:55,289
The other things that we agreed to during this process is the centralization of some of our pre-K services and some expansion of that programming.

151
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:01,075
So, if you have very young children, you know that our pre-K services are typically half-day programs.

152
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:05,540
And our full day programs do stop short of a full school day.

153
00:17:06,661 --> 00:17:18,773
The plan is that they will those services will ultimately come out of our elementary schools and come into a centralized place with expanded capacity for enrollment.

154
00:17:19,714 --> 00:17:22,216
The other things that we did talk about were.

155
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:38,695
Continuing to house our municipal daycare, which we call kids corner and making space for the Medford family network, which is just 1 of the gems of Medford for young families and something that obviously the district supports continuing forward with.

156
00:17:38,836 --> 00:17:38,996
So.

157
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:43,779
All of the eligibility period work was definitely, it felt like a lot of paperwork.

158
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:50,463
We had to talk about how we maintain our buildings and what our protocols are and do this enrollment study.

159
00:17:50,523 --> 00:17:59,349
But the end result of the eligibility phase is an agreement that we will be building a building for 1,395 9-12 students.

160
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,791
That gave us the green light to move forward to Module 2.

161
00:18:04,072 --> 00:18:07,173
in the MSBA process, which allows us to sort of form a team.

162
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:20,597
And I was very excited to get to module two because it meant that we could start to solicit support from beyond our own administrative team in the schools and our building committee.

163
00:18:21,277 --> 00:18:24,238
And that's when we brought left field on in June, 2025.

164
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,920
And then the designer, our designer team, SMMA joined us.

165
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,922
after a vote in October in November of 2025.

166
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:44,110
So with all of that in place, lots of paperwork, many, many hours of work, we get to sort of turn our attention to the exciting stuff around the feasibility study.

167
00:18:44,651 --> 00:18:46,712
I'm going to turn it over to Matt to talk about that.

168
00:18:47,553 --> 00:18:48,634
The one thing I will say is

169
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:55,478
What I was sad about when we got to the feasibility study was there was still more paperwork to do before we could get to the really exciting stuff.

170
00:18:56,058 --> 00:19:00,140
And I'm super excited that we're finally there and we're finally sort of moving out of the paperwork phase.

171
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,622
So I'll let Matt talk gloriously about what's next.

172
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:04,103
Thank you, Jenny.

173
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:16,892
So we just wanted to start with kind of high-level schedule here, just so everybody can kind of understand the full process, and then I'll dive into a little bit of detail on the feasibility study and what we're actively working on.

174
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:25,899
So you can see on the far left where we are today, just starting 2026, working our way through the feasibility study.

175
00:19:27,822 --> 00:19:33,349
The feasibility study has two phases in it and two submissions to the MSBA.

176
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,295
One is called the preliminary design program or PDP.

177
00:19:37,983 --> 00:19:41,344
And the second one is called the Preferred Schematic Report, or PSR.

178
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:45,885
And I'll get into a bit more detail on those on the next slide.

179
00:19:46,685 --> 00:20:06,630
But just to continue with the full schedule, once we submit those two options, those two submissions to the MSBA, we will know at that point in time what the school will generally look like regarding whether it's an addition renovation

180
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:14,549
or a completely new build, and that will allow us to proceed into schematic design.

181
00:20:15,449 --> 00:20:34,953
Schematic design is when we'll start to get into a bit more detail on this selected option, and it's when we'll start to figure out large building systems, the real expensive stuff, so that we can start to formulate a project budget and understand what the cost of this is going to be.

182
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:41,375
At the end of the schematic design phase, we do have another submission to the MSBA.

183
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:59,762
This is really kind of the last major submission during this early phase, which will set, like I said, the square footage and size of the building, whether or not it's an addition renovation or a new build, and what the project scope and budget is.

184
00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:06,575
The MSBA, we're anticipating to submit that report to the MSBA in early 2027.

185
00:21:08,937 --> 00:21:18,966
I think February 2027 is our anticipated Board of Directors meetings with the MSBA after they review that schematic design submittal.

186
00:21:20,707 --> 00:21:24,770
If the MSBA approves it at the Board of Directors meeting at the

187
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:45,768
In February of 2027, it will go to a town vote, which is when the community will vote to approve the funding for the project so that we can proceed into the rest of the schedule.

188
00:21:46,148 --> 00:21:48,549
So you see that approvals phase in early 2027.

189
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:56,544
And if it does get approved, then we'll proceed into the detailed design phase of the project.

190
00:21:56,945 --> 00:22:11,081
This is where we start to really get into floor plans, very detailed information on what materials we're using inside the building, outside the building, and we'll really start to refine

191
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,058
the overall design of the project.

192
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:23,265
There's roughly about a year worth of design development and construction documents to complete the full design of the project.

193
00:22:24,006 --> 00:22:31,751
We would anticipate probably starting some early site work while the building documents are being completed.

194
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:40,338
We would anticipate starting some construction in 2028, mobilization to the site, and like I said, some site work.

195
00:22:40,877 --> 00:22:56,480
the bulk of the construction will occur in 2029 and through 2030, with the anticipation of the school being completed for the opening day of school in September of 2030.

196
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,741
So that's our overall kind of project timeline at the moment.

197
00:23:05,762 --> 00:23:07,942
But to touch base on where we are currently,

198
00:23:09,673 --> 00:23:19,619
So, like I had mentioned, there's three major deliverables during this early phase, two in the feasibility study, and then the schematic design.

199
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:24,601
So, that first submission, again, is the preliminary design program, or PDP.

200
00:23:26,422 --> 00:23:28,723
This is an internal review by the MSBA.

201
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:30,684
There is no formal, like, board of directors

202
00:23:32,312 --> 00:23:34,073
approval required.

203
00:23:34,753 --> 00:24:00,045
The majority of the information that is being submitted at this stage in the project is a lot of information gathering and fact finding that we're doing throughout the school, not just on the inside, but we're also evaluating all of the conditions of the site, understanding traffic patterns, the size of the parcel,

204
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:09,659
Where wetlands are, you know, we're really just trying to understand exactly what this site is and what this building looks like in its current state.

205
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,101
We also touch on educational

206
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:19,750
visioning to create an educational program or an ed plan.

207
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:28,593
We'll touch base on this in a bit more detail, but essentially the educational program is really the cornerstone of the project.

208
00:24:28,653 --> 00:24:40,718
It dictates the overall square footage of the building and it really highlights the delivery of education in Medford both now and how it wants to be delivered in the future.

209
00:24:43,586 --> 00:24:44,787
The initial space summary.

210
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:57,112
This is really a compilation of all of the spaces that we discuss with the administration to understand what is kind of their ideal idea for the school.

211
00:24:58,892 --> 00:25:05,395
And it just outlines all of the spaces that would be required for that project.

212
00:25:06,795 --> 00:25:11,477
The space summary is a document that is provided by the Massachusetts School Building Authority.

213
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:13,277
It's a very prescribed document.

214
00:25:14,218 --> 00:25:18,019
The MSBA sets limits on certain room sizes.

215
00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:22,321
So it's a very large document.

216
00:25:24,137 --> 00:25:30,200
that has a lot of information and really at the end of the day will kind of drive the overall size of the project.

217
00:25:31,861 --> 00:25:38,045
And the other thing that we're working on right now currently is looking at alternative options.

218
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:43,167
This is also a requirement of the MSBA.

219
00:25:44,128 --> 00:25:47,710
We need to study what it would

220
00:25:48,874 --> 00:26:02,419
what it would cost and if it is actually feasible to do a just a code upgrade of the building, a renovation of the building, an addition renovation of the building or a new or a new building.

221
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:09,221
So as we start to gather all this information from the existing conditions and the educational program,

222
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:19,534
we will start to create a bunch of different options of all of those different construction types.

223
00:26:20,755 --> 00:26:28,563
And we'll slowly start to kind of figure out which one fits best, both from an educational standpoint and a cost standpoint.

224
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:44,577
When we move into the next phase of the project, which is called the preferred schematic report, which is the second phase of the feasibility study, this is when we'll start to really dial in on what the option wants to be.

225
00:26:45,518 --> 00:26:51,901
We'll continue to look at all of the existing conditions and finalize what all of those existing conditions are.

226
00:26:53,142 --> 00:27:00,927
We'll finalize that educational plan to really make sure that everything is being incorporated that Medford wants.

227
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:12,295
And by the time we submit this preferred schematic report, we will tell the MSBA which option we think is the best moving forward.

228
00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:15,656
And that submission happens in June of 2026.

229
00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:24,221
So we're about six months out from figuring out what we think the best option is going to be.

230
00:27:28,808 --> 00:27:35,451
After that PSR submission, there will be a formal board of directors meeting to approve that.

231
00:27:36,412 --> 00:27:43,835
The MSBA will say, yes, we agree that this is the most educationally appropriate facility for the city.

232
00:27:45,276 --> 00:27:47,197
And then we'll proceed into schematic design.

233
00:27:48,435 --> 00:28:02,394
This is where everything in the first two phases are really, really cleaned up and really finalized with the end goal of reaching an understanding of overall size.

234
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:13,393
of the facility, like I said, if it's going to be an addition renovation or a complete new build, and then project budget.

235
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:24,658
And we'll be getting detailed estimates from two different estimators at that point in time to understand what the cost is going to look like.

236
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:28,440
With all of that information submitted to the MSBA,

237
00:28:30,986 --> 00:28:33,767
have another board of directors meeting in April of 2027.

238
00:28:36,228 --> 00:28:50,212
And this will essentially improve the scope and the budget and allow the city to proceed to a vote to see if this project will move forward.

239
00:28:57,315 --> 00:28:57,695
Thank you.

240
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:13,033
So when we think about and when we talk about the need and the why associated with this project, it's fundamentally not a facilities or a space conversation.

241
00:29:13,053 --> 00:29:18,396
It's really about what kind of learning environment do our students deserve.

242
00:29:19,396 --> 00:29:28,164
should the community have, and what are the working conditions for our educators so that they can deliver high-quality, equitable education?

243
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:41,216
A lot of our conversations and our prep work to get to the places that we have already been and to the places that we want to get have really been aligned to answering those questions.

244
00:29:42,097 --> 00:29:57,068
We have had lots of conversations around what we want our students to be experiencing in school and how they are going to have that sense of belonging that is our collective charge this year and throughout.

245
00:29:57,208 --> 00:30:04,193
We believe that that is foundational for all learning across our schools and especially at our flagship.

246
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:05,734
We want our students

247
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:11,696
and our staff to be in spaces where they feel represented and valued and seen.

248
00:30:12,537 --> 00:30:19,539
And what that looks like for education today and beyond are flexible spaces.

249
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:29,063
They are spaces that will provide opportunity for collaboration, for voice, for expression, and for representation.

250
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,544
And so

251
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:43,083
As part of this here, this list is parts of the conversation that we've been having with staff members, with our students, and with a collection of stakeholders.

252
00:30:43,563 --> 00:30:51,888
Further on in this presentation, you're going to get an overview of some of the work that we have done in our educational leadership forums.

253
00:30:52,748 --> 00:30:56,192
and in our stakeholder sessions.

254
00:30:56,832 --> 00:31:08,483
Here, what a new Medford High School could have, as I've highlighted, are collaborative learning spaces for our students and our teachers, improved and enlarged CTE spaces and classroom spaces,

255
00:31:09,384 --> 00:31:11,386
Universal accessibility and inclusion.

256
00:31:11,406 --> 00:31:23,476
That's not just about space and facility, not intentionally, but this building has outgrown what we want to provide our students for an education.

257
00:31:24,497 --> 00:31:28,058
It has outgrown what the current capacity should be.

258
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:35,099
And so intentional or not, sometimes this building itself is creating barriers for our students.

259
00:31:35,139 --> 00:31:40,841
So we need to be working on increasing our accessibility and our inclusion.

260
00:31:40,861 --> 00:31:46,962
A modern expansion of our auditorium, much larger seats, much more art.

261
00:31:48,644 --> 00:31:57,456
Across Medford, our schools are used as community spaces, especially here, our high school auditorium is used quite frequently.

262
00:31:58,478 --> 00:32:16,271
for many different events, but to have not only a performance space worthy of our community programs and our school programs, but also for community gathering spaces for our principal and our school leadership to have spaces to gather students collectively is very important to us.

263
00:32:18,413 --> 00:32:25,418
As well as making sure our buildings are up to code, energy efficient and safe and secure learning spaces

264
00:32:26,184 --> 00:32:27,044
for the community.

265
00:32:28,045 --> 00:32:30,446
And we have a wonderful resource here.

266
00:32:30,486 --> 00:32:31,847
We are connected to the Fells.

267
00:32:32,527 --> 00:32:46,893
To be able to provide more opportunity and more enrichment and bring that into not only the learning experiences, but the community experiences is something that's very important to us here in Medford Public Schools.

268
00:32:51,921 --> 00:33:03,865
Right now, currently, the impact that our building is having on our educational delivery is seen in both a physical way and how we're able to use the building.

269
00:33:04,505 --> 00:33:09,907
So currently, physical condition, our roof is in poor condition.

270
00:33:10,047 --> 00:33:14,049
We have many mechanical, electrical, or plumbing issues.

271
00:33:15,589 --> 00:33:28,516
That mostly is seen sometimes in heating and water leaks, in consistent heat, in consistent cooling, wide variations depending on where you are in the building.

272
00:33:28,536 --> 00:33:30,518
IT issues.

273
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:43,344
electrical, it's, like I said before, the building is, we're not able to use it in the manner that we need to be.

274
00:33:44,245 --> 00:33:51,193
We see that impact on our learning, and so the accessibility features, as I previously mentioned,

275
00:33:52,234 --> 00:33:57,477
hinder what we want to be able to provide as an experience for all of our students.

276
00:33:58,117 --> 00:34:00,719
Our building is large, but it is difficult to navigate.

277
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,681
We see that in transitions throughout the building.

278
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:07,002
We see that in the accessibility of the building.

279
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:10,284
We see that also in the supervision and management of the building.

280
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:14,987
And we see that in the layout of the building.

281
00:34:15,127 --> 00:34:19,970
So where classrooms are located and how they are situated in the building

282
00:34:21,451 --> 00:34:31,302
no longer necessarily aligns with our instructional vision and how we want to be able to provide education for our students.

283
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:48,797
So as previously mentioned, one of the ways that we are studying the educational needs of the district is through a very important document called the Educational Plan.

284
00:34:49,738 --> 00:35:02,628
In a moment, Rosemary Park, who's one of the educational consultants for SMMA, will talk about the workshops and forums that we had with teachers and students and stakeholders.

285
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:07,833
All of the work we've been doing is to inform this very important plan.

286
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:16,660
This plan is going to help guide a lot of our decision making when we get to talking about space and design.

287
00:35:17,441 --> 00:35:27,610
So the educational plan is foundational in not only capturing what education looks like currently, but what we want it to look like in the future.

288
00:35:29,107 --> 00:35:42,872
And that's difficult sometimes when we're thinking about what it looks like now, what we think it will look like in five years, what it may look like in 10 years, and what it might look like in 20 years, which is why flexibility is really at the key here.

289
00:35:44,493 --> 00:35:57,338
The educational plan allows us to envision the learning spaces that we want to have, and it really needs to be a direct reflection of our core values

290
00:35:58,078 --> 00:36:01,601
and what our long-term vision is and aligned to our instructional vision.

291
00:36:03,322 --> 00:36:18,794
SMMA, in order to help us build this plan, has been conducting, along with our partnership, comprehensive walkthroughs of both the existing Medford High School as well as other new-build high schools throughout the Commonwealth.

292
00:36:19,334 --> 00:36:23,697
They've been meeting with students, with educators, with families, and with community partners.

293
00:36:24,798 --> 00:36:30,481
detailing program and department interviews, they'll be talking to you about that and there was quite a few.

294
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:40,447
And then the visioning sessions that they will be highlighting where we really got into some conversations about what future models could look like.

295
00:36:40,987 --> 00:36:47,391
And I will tell you that those sessions were the most impactful for me thus far because of the student voice.

296
00:36:47,851 --> 00:36:53,875
It was extremely powerful and that is the why for this whole entire project.

297
00:36:57,297 --> 00:36:58,097
you go, Rosemary.

298
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:01,599
Thank you.

299
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:07,863
Um, so I again just I'm Rosemary Park, and I'm an educational planner and architect with SMMA.

300
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:11,845
Um, and so, um, I think that, uh.

301
00:37:13,006 --> 00:37:18,729
The superintendent gave a very great overview as to some of the work that we have been doing.

302
00:37:19,129 --> 00:37:23,272
Um and you know, we have really been hitting the ground running since we

303
00:37:24,143 --> 00:37:25,904
since we were awarded.

304
00:37:26,224 --> 00:37:34,349
And so just a little bit of background on the process of how we get to an educational space program.

305
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:38,952
And what is the difference between this educational plan and this space program?

306
00:37:38,972 --> 00:37:41,494
There are a lot of these terms that are being used.

307
00:37:42,154 --> 00:37:45,576
And so we just want to give a little clarity surrounding this process.

308
00:37:46,437 --> 00:37:52,120
So if you look at the column on the left, we begin with the educational visioning process.

309
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:52,921
And so

310
00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:07,570
As was mentioned, this was done with the educational leadership team comprised of the district and Medford High School leadership, as well as teachers and school committee members.

311
00:38:08,731 --> 00:38:21,361
And then we also had an additional group of the educational forum, which included the educational leadership team, but also brought in students, parents,

312
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:24,910
additional teachers and community members.

313
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:37,418
And this was, these were led primarily by Mike Parolo, our educational, our educational planner who couldn't be here this evening, but he held some incredible sessions.

314
00:38:37,498 --> 00:38:42,361
And we'll, in the coming slides, we'll talk a little bit more about the takeaways that came from these sessions.

315
00:38:42,622 --> 00:38:50,987
But in the sessions, we really did ask, you know, how do we wanna be teaching and learning in the future?

316
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:59,152
And what does Medford High School want to be doing for the students, the staff, and the overall Medford community?

317
00:39:00,413 --> 00:39:14,619
And so all of this gets realized into the educational plan, which is defining the educational goals and overarching vision for Medford High School.

318
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,741
And so from that, we,

319
00:39:19,397 --> 00:39:48,679
while the educational visioning was happening, concurrently we had in the middle row you see here, we were conducting space programming meetings and we had 49 just only educational space programming meetings where we sat down with each current and future department or user group that would be in the re-imagined Medford High School.

320
00:39:49,524 --> 00:40:05,296
And we listened so that we could really understand what were going to be the types of spaces that they were going to need in order to support their vision, in order to support the curriculum delivery goals.

321
00:40:06,557 --> 00:40:12,421
So from those meetings and from the educational plan, as well as taking a really intensive look

322
00:40:12,989 --> 00:40:29,073
at the curriculum and the master schedule, that helps to inform the educational program or the program space summary, as Matt mentioned earlier, which is this itemized list of every single occupied type of space.

323
00:40:29,653 --> 00:40:35,414
And it lists the quantities and the sizes, the net square footages of each of these spaces.

324
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:42,156
And you can see that by the arrows that are pointing between the educational plan and educational program,

325
00:40:42,945 --> 00:40:45,807
that this is really a feedback loop.

326
00:40:46,088 --> 00:40:55,776
And so the educational plan guides and validates the program, but the space program can also help refine the educational plan.

327
00:40:56,356 --> 00:41:04,663
And so this is a really iterative process, which ultimately will get us to an overall building size or gross square footage.

328
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:11,609
You might hear GSF or GFA in the future, and that is really referring to the overall building size.

329
00:41:12,312 --> 00:41:22,780
And so this overall building size is a direct result of the educational needs that are defined by Medford High School and the community.

330
00:41:28,044 --> 00:41:41,075
And so, as I mentioned, we had several events that comprised the educational visioning sessions, including the educational leadership team

331
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:49,602
Um, and, and some of us on the design team, uh, getting to be students for the day, uh, where we shadowed, uh, Medford high school students.

332
00:41:50,103 --> 00:42:03,689
So that we could really observe, uh, learning through their eyes, through the eyes of a student, um, where you can see, you can see the good, you can see the challenges, you could see the barriers, you could see the moments of engagement.

333
00:42:04,409 --> 00:42:10,992
Um, and I mean, I know that every, every person who was involved in that just felt, um, like it was,

334
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,283
one of the most eye-opening experiences.

335
00:42:15,063 --> 00:42:23,586
And so in addition to that, we also took the educational leadership team on several school tours.

336
00:42:25,707 --> 00:42:34,990
And we also had these two visioning sessions with the educational forum where we discussed all of the goals and the vision for the high school.

337
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,370
And these were,

338
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:56,060
you know, pretty much all day long visioning sessions in which we really took the time to get everyone's feedback, really dig in, understand everyone's hopes, dreams, concerns, fears.

339
00:42:57,181 --> 00:43:07,006
And I have to say that I, you know, the community here is just so dedicated to really improving

340
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:09,658
everyone's outcomes.

341
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:16,222
So I feel, I felt really honored to be a part of all of that.

342
00:43:18,224 --> 00:43:23,407
We have a couple of slides just regarding the outcomes and takeaways of the visioning.

343
00:43:25,068 --> 00:43:31,853
And so we broke these down into sort of two categories of outcomes.

344
00:43:32,554 --> 00:43:36,116
So this slide centers on the,

345
00:43:38,108 --> 00:43:45,812
the goals on the Medford High School culture and the student experience of an MHS student.

346
00:43:46,412 --> 00:43:53,336
And so overwhelmingly, the educational forum agreed that providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all was a key priority.

347
00:43:53,396 --> 00:43:59,659
And that really helped inform a lot of the other key takeaways from the vision.

348
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:02,360
So this meant recognizing that

349
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:06,832
not every student thrives in the same kind of space.

350
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:15,857
So the distribution of smaller and quieter support spaces just throughout the building for differentiated types of learning was desired.

351
00:44:17,718 --> 00:44:32,405
The group had also noted that movement, flexibility and choice for students were necessary so that they could directly support the focus and wellness and the student agency

352
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:37,474
that the team really wanted to provide for the students.

353
00:44:39,215 --> 00:44:55,749
And then also just providing the opportunities for frequent collaboration for both students and staff, whether intentionally planned or informal, so that we could really help foster the relationships and deepen the learning for everyone.

354
00:45:01,012 --> 00:45:18,618
And then in terms of teaching and learning takeaways, so there is a strong support for a comprehensive integrated school that brought together different pathways and identities while still also feeling like one unified MHS.

355
00:45:19,339 --> 00:45:28,382
The forum also favored collaborative learning communities over the long traditional corridors, some of which you have at Medford High School today.

356
00:45:29,028 --> 00:45:39,794
And so these would be spaces that really help encourage connection and disability instead of just having a straight long run with just solid walls on either side.

357
00:45:41,615 --> 00:45:57,525
And there was a desire to integrate CTE with academics, because this was seen as a way to be able to expand access to hands-on real world learning for more or even all students, because people really valued

358
00:45:57,946 --> 00:46:02,349
types of experiences that the CTE students were getting.

359
00:46:04,051 --> 00:46:17,762
And then finally, the visioning workshop members believed that the shared spaces, believed that shared spaces would work best in a school if they were intentionally designed and then instructionally driven.

360
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:21,985
So purposely integrated within the space.

361
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:30,770
All right.

362
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:31,891
Thank you, Rosemary.

363
00:46:31,911 --> 00:46:33,931
And hello everyone.

364
00:46:34,171 --> 00:46:35,492
I'm just going to reintroduce myself.

365
00:46:35,512 --> 00:46:36,412
My name is Matt Rice.

366
00:46:37,213 --> 00:46:41,014
I'm an architect with SMMA and I'm the principal in charge for SMMA as well.

367
00:46:42,114 --> 00:46:46,156
So as Rosemary and Dr. Galluzzi just went through, there's an incredible amount of

368
00:46:46,536 --> 00:46:50,078
work being done right now on the educational front to clarify the vision.

369
00:46:50,839 --> 00:47:00,304
But at the same time, we're also running a parallel set of activities that is really the fact finding and the information gathering that Matt referred to earlier on.

370
00:47:00,604 --> 00:47:14,092
We're trying to get as detailed of an understanding of the existing building and the existing site as possible so that we can understand exactly what we're working with and understand how we might move forward from a physical facilities perspective.

371
00:47:15,652 --> 00:47:30,628
So, in terms of those investigations, we're really tackling it from a whole variety of different perspectives from both our own staff, as well as specialty consultants that are looking at particular aspects of the building and the site.

372
00:47:31,409 --> 00:47:41,076
So to start off with, we are doing a detailed architectural and structural survey, which is visual observations by our technical staff within those two disciplines.

373
00:47:41,977 --> 00:47:51,304
And that's actually run parallel with detailed reviews from our mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection engineers as well walking to the building.

374
00:47:52,966 --> 00:48:07,100
We're also having a consultant come in and review hazardous materials that are located within the building so that we have an accurate understanding of what might need to be removed in either a full demolition or renovation scope.

375
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,962
Hazardous materials need to be abated.

376
00:48:09,402 --> 00:48:11,504
prior to either of those activities occurring.

377
00:48:12,585 --> 00:48:32,283
We have had a company come through and do a 3D scan of the existing building so that we know at a very fine-grained level of detail where all the partitions, where all the elements of the structure are, so we understand really very granularly how the building is comprised.

378
00:48:34,259 --> 00:48:36,100
We are conducting a site survey as well.

379
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:49,971
We have surveyors that have been out marking the perimeter, the property lines of the site itself, as well as topographical contours, the land as it moves across the site.

380
00:48:51,051 --> 00:49:00,635
utilities that are on the site, and really every aspect of the sort of physical topography itself, including site finish materials.

381
00:49:01,816 --> 00:49:14,401
Part of that actually is also identifying any wetlands that exist on the site and surrounding the site, so that we can plan for any interactions from an environmental permitting standpoint there.

382
00:49:15,621 --> 00:49:23,989
We are doing geotechnical explorations, which is really trying to get a better understanding of what is the characteristics of the earth that we're building upon.

383
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:32,818
So we do both borings, you can see some photographs of drill rigs there towards the top of the slide where they actually drill a hole down.

384
00:49:33,419 --> 00:49:40,628
and take a core out to understand at a very deep depth what the character of the soil or the rock is.

385
00:49:40,648 --> 00:49:50,640
And then we also do test pits with those excavators that you also see in the photographs to, at a shallower depth, understand the characteristics of the soil.

386
00:49:52,734 --> 00:50:10,187
We, at the same time, are studying geo-environmental conditions, so where there might have been buried oil tanks on site, we understand where those were, how they were removed, and whether or not there's any residual materials that need to be addressed from a soils perspective.

387
00:50:10,927 --> 00:50:25,401
Um, we are looking at the traffic flow in and out of the site, having traffic on site, doing counts of vehicles that are moving, looking at both cars, buses, every type of vehicle that are coming in and out of the site.

388
00:50:26,582 --> 00:50:36,968
We do a test of the hydrant flow capacity on site to understand whether or not we need to supplement the fire protection system for the school moving forward.

389
00:50:36,988 --> 00:50:41,010
The existing school does not have a fire protection system in most of the building.

390
00:50:41,351 --> 00:50:43,692
There's a few later renovation areas that do have it.

391
00:50:44,272 --> 00:50:46,973
but primarily unprotected at the moment.

392
00:50:46,993 --> 00:50:50,434
So we need to know some specifics as we design the new system.

393
00:50:51,074 --> 00:50:58,557
And then lastly, we also take measurements for environmental noise on the site itself.

394
00:50:59,317 --> 00:51:03,919
So we have been installing microphones to understand what is the ambient noise level.

395
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:12,722
So when we build a new building, we're not increasing the ambient noise for the surrounding community beyond acceptable thresholds.

396
00:51:15,388 --> 00:51:20,891
So just some quick observations from all that investigation that we have been doing to date.

397
00:51:21,272 --> 00:51:22,933
Some of it has been completed at this point.

398
00:51:22,993 --> 00:51:28,776
Some of it is still ongoing, not quite as we speak, but certainly during the course of the day earlier today.

399
00:51:29,877 --> 00:51:39,023
So what we know, and these may be very apparent for those that are familiar with the high school building, but maybe for those of you that are not, there's some interesting points here.

400
00:51:40,003 --> 00:51:45,547
One, just the fact that the building itself, the high school, is not visible from Winthrop Street.

401
00:51:46,348 --> 00:51:54,054
And that has some challenges in terms of the building having an identity on the site and sort of an awareness of where the building is.

402
00:51:55,275 --> 00:52:02,160
In a similar fashion, there is only one point of entry from Winthrop Street and one exit as well, consequently.

403
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:11,712
And so that limited access point into the site is something that is a challenge that we need to examine as we move forward.

404
00:52:13,153 --> 00:52:20,463
In terms of the actual site coverings, a little more than half of the site is actually paved currently.

405
00:52:21,183 --> 00:52:24,266
So impervious in terms of rainwater coming down.

406
00:52:25,567 --> 00:52:30,031
And it just is, there's a lot of pavement on site overall.

407
00:52:30,751 --> 00:52:37,717
And direct correlation to that is the fact that there's few shade trees around the entirety of the site itself.

408
00:52:38,097 --> 00:52:45,343
Certainly the fell surrounds the site and provides some perimeter cooling, but on the site itself there's a very small quantity of trees.

409
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:52,468
There's an incredible amount of vertical height change from Winthrop Street all the way top to the top of the site at Edgerly Field.

410
00:52:53,229 --> 00:52:58,333
80 feet of vertical grade change is several, several stories going up.

411
00:52:59,053 --> 00:53:04,918
If you've been on the high school site, you certainly have felt that walking up and walking through the building itself.

412
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:08,566
There's no treatment of the stormwater on site.

413
00:53:09,546 --> 00:53:15,768
The accessible parking spaces that are on site have compliance issues in terms of overall.

414
00:53:16,108 --> 00:53:23,671
And even when you get out of an accessible parking space, usually the grade that you have to navigate to get into the building is not compliant.

415
00:53:24,171 --> 00:53:25,891
So there's issues there.

416
00:53:26,652 --> 00:53:30,213
Similarly, moving up to the building from Winthrop Street,

417
00:53:30,894 --> 00:53:32,616
has some accessibility challenges.

418
00:53:33,177 --> 00:53:41,569
And once you actually get to the building doors themselves, there are many of them that have stairs limiting entry for the public.

419
00:53:43,662 --> 00:53:47,163
And then in terms of the building, the building is 55 years old.

420
00:53:48,023 --> 00:53:51,683
And unlike a lot of buildings, the majority of it is the original footprint.

421
00:53:51,703 --> 00:53:55,684
There was not a lot of additions put onto the building, any additions put onto the building.

422
00:53:56,224 --> 00:54:12,347
And then the renovations that were done for the science lab, some of the CTE spaces, which were renovated by the CTE programs themselves, the Medford community media space, the TV studio in there as well with some of the later renovations.

423
00:54:13,307 --> 00:54:19,690
By and large, the entirety of the building is that 55-year-old structure that was originally built.

424
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:32,576
We talked about the challenges in terms of accessibility for students, as well as community that are visiting the building and taking advantage of the numerous community resources that are there.

425
00:54:33,716 --> 00:54:43,365
That roof that is in poor condition is due in the large part to significant areas of ponding on the roof, and ponding is when water is not able to drain off the roof.

426
00:54:43,485 --> 00:54:48,990
And so if you look at that upper right hand photograph, you can see a large area where water is reflecting back at you.

427
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:53,414
And those areas are both on sort of the most recently

428
00:54:55,035 --> 00:54:58,196
re-roofed section over the science lab, as well as the older section of roof.

429
00:54:58,216 --> 00:55:02,958
So there's roofing challenges across the entirety of the structure.

430
00:55:04,238 --> 00:55:11,441
The building systems, because the majority are original to the building, are all at their useful life expectancy.

431
00:55:12,121 --> 00:55:21,945
And so there's valiant efforts that are being made on a daily basis to really combat things that are falling into disrepair, needing repair, and

432
00:55:23,265 --> 00:55:31,508
really causing challenges in terms of areas of the building that have to be sectioned off from use, which causes disruptions to the education going on.

433
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:43,532
I think that the uneven air temperatures from the mechanical system and the noise that are generated from those original units was mentioned earlier.

434
00:55:43,872 --> 00:55:48,694
And also the fact that the emergency generators within the building are not functional right now.

435
00:55:48,794 --> 00:55:52,795
So from a safety and resiliency standpoint, there's challenges to be had.

436
00:56:07,332 --> 00:56:15,238
I may have skipped over that other lead in slide too quickly here, but I think we're just going to shift gears into ways we can engage.

437
00:56:15,419 --> 00:56:18,401
Yep.

438
00:56:18,801 --> 00:56:24,225
I was looking at what slide I was supposed to take and then I didn't look at the actual number of the slides.

439
00:56:24,245 --> 00:56:24,946
So sorry about that.

440
00:56:26,447 --> 00:56:36,209
So, we're going to wrap up with talking about some of the many ways that this is a project of many and already is.

441
00:56:36,449 --> 00:56:53,652
So, I mean, you're hearing from a handful of us tonight, but in some of the work that the team has been doing, Rosemary and her team to understand how we do things at Medford High from an educational perspective has held 49 programming meetings.

442
00:56:53,692 --> 00:56:54,752
You can see them all here.

443
00:56:55,442 --> 00:57:11,572
In each of these meetings, she was meeting with teachers, department heads, subject matter experts in these topics to understand what space they use, how they use it, what happens in the program, so a tremendous amount of data gathering.

444
00:57:11,772 --> 00:57:15,415
And I've been so impressed that

445
00:57:16,711 --> 00:57:21,594
you like literally can't stump Rosemary about how things happen in our programs right now.

446
00:57:21,634 --> 00:57:23,455
Like she's just like right there.

447
00:57:23,555 --> 00:57:27,317
She doesn't miss a beat when you say, how does this program do this thing?

448
00:57:27,437 --> 00:57:27,897
She knows.

449
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:39,343
And that's part of the getting to know you phase that, you know, feels like paperwork, but it's like super, super important because it's going to help her help us inform some of the work that we do.

450
00:57:39,363 --> 00:57:42,425
Matt, if you go to the next slide.

451
00:57:44,117 --> 00:57:55,599
The other thing that is actively happening is that we've formed four advisory teams, each with like a specific specialty, and we have populated those teams.

452
00:57:55,919 --> 00:58:08,762
There's some crossover with our building committee, but we have cast a wider net to the community to say, if you have a particular expertise about these particular topics, we would love to hear from you in a,

453
00:58:10,421 --> 00:58:21,812
In a way that will not bury you in meetings and time commitment, but will be really impactful so that the architects can hear from a wider swath of Medford.

454
00:58:21,852 --> 00:58:27,438
So the sustainability and MEP systems has 16 folks on it, including.

455
00:58:28,636 --> 00:58:38,618
folks from inside the school, as well as people in our community who are construction project managers and sustainability experts.

456
00:58:38,658 --> 00:58:40,099
We have folks from City Hall joining us.

457
00:58:41,299 --> 00:58:48,981
If you go to the right, I'm going to go like around the circle here, the site safety and security team includes Chief Buckley and Chief Evans.

458
00:58:50,381 --> 00:58:55,142
It includes Tim McGivern and a whole variety of people who

459
00:58:56,538 --> 00:59:10,435
are weighing in on things like traffic circulation and the safety of the site, and what is possible on the site, and asking questions like, can there be more playing fields on the site?

460
00:59:10,655 --> 00:59:12,558
And what happens if

461
00:59:13,497 --> 00:59:25,665
How do we make sure that the bus service is not hindered by the flow of traffic with students on foot or cars?

462
00:59:26,386 --> 00:59:33,510
So lots of sort of, I'll call it like outside physical space kinds of questions and considerations happening on that team.

463
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:36,072
So we have 18 folks with us on that team.

464
00:59:36,967 --> 00:59:57,156
Then we have an interior and exterior design team that is talking about the kinds of materials we're interested in using and ultimately what the inside and outside of the building looks like, what people's eye is wanting and expecting from this project.

465
00:59:57,916 --> 00:59:58,937
We have 18 folks there.

466
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:13,025
And then we have our educational planning and equity team, largely made up of district staff with a handful of folks from the community and who work in similar capacities in other districts who live here.

467
01:00:13,045 --> 01:00:14,867
We have 23 team members there.

468
01:00:16,052 --> 01:00:27,581
Every time we put out a call to say we want people with particular expertise, I'm just completely blown away by how skilled and expert Medford really is.

469
01:00:27,701 --> 01:00:31,724
So we had no trouble appointing these folks.

470
01:00:32,124 --> 01:00:33,986
Each team has students on it as well.

471
01:00:35,287 --> 01:00:44,152
But we had no trouble appointing folks with really particular and direct expertise about the things that we were here to talk about.

472
01:00:44,252 --> 01:01:02,824
So it's always so like such a nice reminder of what Medford really is when we get a chance to do these things, because it's like, wow, there are 15 people actually who have done this exact thing somewhere in Medford and that they're willing to spend their time and expertise.

473
01:01:03,705 --> 01:01:07,011
We have folks from various boards and commissions serving on these advisory teams.

474
01:01:08,938 --> 01:01:10,960
folks from city departments, and the list goes on.

475
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,702
So that's one of the things that's already happening.

476
01:01:14,342 --> 01:01:16,844
You can actually watch those meetings.

477
01:01:17,785 --> 01:01:18,485
They are live.

478
01:01:18,645 --> 01:01:20,206
They are on our YouTube channel.

479
01:01:21,027 --> 01:01:25,090
And the first round of meetings was held right before the holidays.

480
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:27,412
The second round of meetings will be held next week.

481
01:01:27,472 --> 01:01:31,675
So all of those are meetings that we are recording and making available.

482
01:01:31,695 --> 01:01:35,378
So if people want to hear what folks are saying, what we're thinking about,

483
01:01:36,739 --> 01:01:41,503
You're more than welcome to go out and take a peek through each of those meetings.

484
01:01:41,543 --> 01:01:44,285
They're each about an hour and a half a piece.

485
01:01:47,658 --> 01:01:55,163
So, as we look forward and start to talk about casting, like, even a wider net, there's a number of ways that you can engage.

486
01:01:55,683 --> 01:01:57,064
We do have a project website.

487
01:01:57,704 --> 01:02:05,970
It's where all of our deliverables are where you can find building committee agendas among other things project documents and increasing.

488
01:02:07,278 --> 01:02:15,307
list of FAQs, and all the information that you could need about the facts and figures of this project as that evolves.

489
01:02:16,628 --> 01:02:18,370
This is the first community forum.

490
01:02:19,131 --> 01:02:26,880
We chose to do it in a webinar format to make sure that we're maximizing language access for folks who need translation.

491
01:02:27,633 --> 01:02:36,436
And we intend to continue to provide translation services for those residents who require it both virtually and in person.

492
01:02:38,216 --> 01:02:42,637
And we will have another community forum like this in March, I'll talk about in just a minute.

493
01:02:43,678 --> 01:02:51,720
The school building committees are open to the public and we welcome your participation and there will be increasing places

494
01:02:52,832 --> 01:03:00,174
for more than just approving invoices and taking in lots of information, but really having some dialogue about what things are going to move forward.

495
01:03:01,174 --> 01:03:03,295
And so all of that is coming up as well.

496
01:03:04,535 --> 01:03:12,417
And then as we continue forward, you'll start to see our extended team out and about in the community.

497
01:03:13,257 --> 01:03:17,198
They're really excited to hit the farmer's market, which is being held at the beer hall right now in winter.

498
01:03:18,316 --> 01:03:34,343
a nice warm spot, and then play different community events, different school events, really to bring this project to life out in the community so that people who may not know about it get a chance to know about it.

499
01:03:34,663 --> 01:03:41,506
People who may not be able to come to meetings get a chance to know about what the plans are and where we're at at any given time.

500
01:03:41,666 --> 01:03:45,748
So all that is to come as we talk about opportunities in the future.

501
01:03:49,285 --> 01:03:56,053
Very specifically, in the next two months, there is a tremendous amount of activity happening.

502
01:03:56,834 --> 01:04:01,158
As Matt mentioned, by the end of February, we will be submitting our PDB.

503
01:04:02,906 --> 01:04:06,647
In order to get there, a number of things need to happen.

504
01:04:06,687 --> 01:04:09,548
So I'm going to just sort of run through this in chronological order.

505
01:04:09,588 --> 01:04:11,228
I think that's the easiest way to do it.

506
01:04:12,688 --> 01:04:17,770
Next week on Wednesday at the MHS library is a building committee meeting.

507
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:26,072
This will be everybody, including the building committees, sort of first look at some design concepts.

508
01:04:26,832 --> 01:04:33,294
And Matt and Matt can correct me if I'm wrong, but the way I'm envisioning this is like a big piece of paper.

509
01:04:33,814 --> 01:04:47,959
That is, like, the property and, like, different circles or squares about, like, where the building could roughly be so very rough cut, but an opportunity for us to provide some guidance to say.

510
01:04:49,016 --> 01:04:50,577
You've given us 20 options.

511
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:53,079
We hate options two through five.

512
01:04:53,419 --> 01:04:55,200
All the rest of them we want to know more about.

513
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:02,024
And so that helps us start to narrow that funnel so that those design alternatives can move through the process.

514
01:05:03,906 --> 01:05:08,769
On the 11th, there will be another building committee meeting.

515
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:18,175
And in that building committee meeting, we'll be looking at, we'll be taking what we move forward from that first look to starting to talk about,

516
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:42,380
in a very rough way, what kind of costs would we expect with those options, as well as starting to talk about some of the anchor options of a code renovation, and starting to talk about the nuances of ad reno options, which are where we might

517
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:51,962
Preserve some things in the building and not others, so all of that will will again continue unfolding on February 11th.

518
01:05:52,202 --> 01:05:56,343
There will certainly be more opportunity to collect your feedback and input at that time.

519
01:05:58,064 --> 01:06:03,725
And then on the 23rd, there is another building committee meeting, and that's where we will be finalizing our submission.

520
01:06:03,805 --> 01:06:08,206
So that will sort of be the culmination of that little track of work on.

521
01:06:10,711 --> 01:06:14,896
The 5th of March, there will be a community input session.

522
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:22,186
And so what will happen there after we submit the sort of broader package of these are all the things that we're thinking about.

523
01:06:22,226 --> 01:06:23,027
These are all the.

524
01:06:26,256 --> 01:06:29,879
designs that we're going to continue to study in the coming months.

525
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:36,845
We will be like laying that sort of final package out for the community to do an input collection session.

526
01:06:36,885 --> 01:06:44,051
So that's where we'll be saying to you, tell us what you think about options A through G or options 1 through 10.

527
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:49,436
And really specifically asking the community to like weigh in.

528
01:06:49,496 --> 01:06:50,016
What do you love?

529
01:06:50,036 --> 01:06:50,517
What do you hate?

530
01:06:51,817 --> 01:06:52,438
What do you wish?

531
01:06:52,798 --> 01:07:07,483
So that will be like a real, I see that as like one of the most exciting sessions that we'll do because we'll really be as a community thinking about how do we shape and narrow down our set of options.

532
01:07:09,704 --> 01:07:12,024
And then finally on the 23rd of January,

533
01:07:14,434 --> 01:07:21,453
March, we'll have our regular building committee meeting where we'll be updating and continuing to refine and get.

534
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,881
uh, more finite and narrow about the things that we're pursuing.

535
01:07:25,901 --> 01:07:35,503
Um, so that's the track for the building committee and some of the community forums on the right side of the, um, of the page.

536
01:07:35,643 --> 01:07:40,944
I want to make sure that I give service to the work that is being done with the educational plan.

537
01:07:41,644 --> 01:07:45,065
That is a deliverable that will also go in at the end of February.

538
01:07:46,126 --> 01:08:03,420
It is a deliverable that is really a district deliverable with the support of this team, and that is where we will be outlining how we intend to implement an educational program in said revised building, revised slash new building.

539
01:08:05,348 --> 01:08:10,794
And the school committee has to review that and ultimately approve it before it can be submitted.

540
01:08:10,914 --> 01:08:16,300
So we will have our 1st review of that on the 26th that are regularly scheduled school committee meeting.

541
01:08:16,852 --> 01:08:22,734
And then on February 2nd, we will plan, it's our plan to ask for approval of that document.

542
01:08:23,394 --> 01:08:28,016
And that angles us all towards this submission that Matt was talking about at the end of February.

543
01:08:29,656 --> 01:08:32,917
What the MSBA is gonna do with all of that is provide us feedback.

544
01:08:33,878 --> 01:08:39,520
They build buildings for a living, so they have lots of really helpful and constructive input to provide.

545
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:44,941
But they also will use our educational plan to say,

546
01:08:46,703 --> 01:09:02,059
You know, based on what we're intending to accomplish in the building, what is their recommendation in terms of which of these designs meet or don't meet so that we can refine those options as we go?

547
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:08,025
So there'll be a lot of input and feedback from MSBA in those coming months and that will help us.

548
01:09:09,057 --> 01:09:23,178
And the building committee and the school committee and the entire community sort of like, get from 20 options to 15 options to 10 options to 5 options to 1 option, which is where we will land at the end of June.

549
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:29,752
And in all of these meetings, the public participation is welcome and encouraged.

550
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:43,499
The rules of the school committee and the rules of the building committee are available online, but roughly speaking, we do ask that people limit their comments to three minutes if they want to speak live.

551
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:48,401
We're also exploring some other ways to collect input in these sessions so that it doesn't

552
01:09:49,002 --> 01:09:55,426
simply have to be, I have to be in a place where I can come to a podium and say something in order to have my voice heard.

553
01:09:55,446 --> 01:10:00,208
Um, so you'll see a lot of opportunity for surveys and engagement and that kind of thing.

554
01:10:00,228 --> 01:10:04,130
Um, as you go to these meetings, all of these meetings are recorded.

555
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:05,571
They're all on our YouTube channel.

556
01:10:06,252 --> 01:10:15,016
Um, you're welcome to join us at any of them, um, in person or in zoom, um, school committee meetings at city hall, building committee meetings at the NHS library.

557
01:10:15,036 --> 01:10:17,658
Next.

558
01:10:19,453 --> 01:10:24,176
And we have been collecting a handful of questions and answers.

559
01:10:24,196 --> 01:10:29,679
I'm going to turn it over to will to feel to sort of moderate some questions and answers.

560
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,260
There's a QR code on the screen.

561
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:36,323
So this is like, your 1st chance to tell us the things you've been dying to tell.

562
01:10:37,584 --> 01:10:40,526
Matt and Matt about the things you hope and wish for this building.

563
01:10:40,606 --> 01:10:48,933
So these go directly to Matt's cell phone and he will be adjusting designs in live time.

564
01:10:49,053 --> 01:11:01,283
But really, this is a place for you to tell us what are you looking for in this project, from the process, in the project, or in a building.

565
01:11:01,363 --> 01:11:03,865
So QR code there, please, by all means.

566
01:11:05,312 --> 01:11:07,214
you know, fire away, we'd love to hear from you.

567
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:12,980
And I'm going to turn it over to Will, so he can moderate and field some of the Q&A that has been coming in.

568
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:14,741
Awesome.

569
01:11:14,861 --> 01:11:15,362
Thanks, Jenny.

570
01:11:15,782 --> 01:11:16,723
My name is Wilfred Paselli.

571
01:11:16,783 --> 01:11:26,653
I'm the Communications Director for Metro Public Schools, and I've been keeping my eye out on the chat and trying to answer some of the simple ones, and then also leave some open for this Q&A period.

572
01:11:27,288 --> 01:11:30,470
So we have a question that says, will there be air conditioning?

573
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:38,753
Can someone from the SMA team just kind of talk about some of the givens that regardless of what this building looks like will be featured in this project?

574
01:11:40,854 --> 01:11:42,255
Yeah, well, I can take that.

575
01:11:42,735 --> 01:11:46,617
So to answer the specific question, yes, there will be air conditioning in the building.

576
01:11:47,257 --> 01:11:56,542
There's actually a whole list of given items that we were reviewing with all the educators as Rosemary was going through the programming discussions.

577
01:11:57,402 --> 01:12:02,205
just to help everyone have a baseline level of comfort with what we're going to be envisioning.

578
01:12:03,226 --> 01:12:16,133
Proper daylighting for classrooms, proper AV technology within the learning environments, furniture that is adaptive and responsive to the educational needs.

579
01:12:17,033 --> 01:12:19,675
I'm probably not remembering everyone off the top of my head.

580
01:12:19,695 --> 01:12:25,238
I don't know if Rosemary has others that she has sort of burned into her psyche from repeating them over and over again.

581
01:12:25,873 --> 01:12:36,821
That was a reliable Wi-Fi, just better way of finding overall, both within the building, outside of the building as well.

582
01:12:37,902 --> 01:12:52,733
And I mean, it was a very, yeah, it was a pretty good list, but I mean, oh, outlets, you know, educators, we find educators really don't ask for that much.

583
01:12:53,689 --> 01:13:03,535
In the end, it's really just we would like good Wi-Fi and some outlets and not power cords everywhere, but they'll get that.

584
01:13:04,536 --> 01:13:22,708
So if I could pull it up, I mean, I think we could post something about it, but yeah, most of the givens are just some basic comfort things that should exist in any renovation or

585
01:13:24,476 --> 01:13:26,238
you know, new construction school.

586
01:13:28,139 --> 01:13:30,701
The last one I'll mention is toilet rooms also.

587
01:13:30,761 --> 01:13:36,086
That's the other one that jumped, which I don't know why I didn't remember that one just to start off with, because that's probably at the top of the list.

588
01:13:36,186 --> 01:13:48,616
But toilet rooms for staff and students within the building, as well as the public visiting the building that are, they're spaced closely enough, they're clean, and they're accessible.

589
01:13:49,137 --> 01:13:51,579
So that will be definitely part of the

590
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:53,822
the solution at the end of the day.

591
01:13:55,443 --> 01:13:55,723
Awesome.

592
01:13:55,903 --> 01:13:56,284
Thank you.

593
01:13:56,524 --> 01:13:58,225
We got a question on the project timeline.

594
01:13:58,265 --> 01:14:04,609
So how does our project timeline kind of compare to other schools that are undergoing the MSBA process?

595
01:14:07,548 --> 01:14:12,090
Very similar, and I did see that comment.

596
01:14:14,071 --> 01:14:17,373
I can clarify on the schedule a little bit better.

597
01:14:17,393 --> 01:14:23,717
The two and a half year construction timeline is probably a little short, but that's because we're going to be

598
01:14:24,397 --> 01:14:31,819
Starting a little bit earlier, like I said, we're going to mobilize to site probably while we're still finishing the documents get some site work going.

599
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:41,782
So there's probably, you know, a few months to six months before the actual building starts that will be out, you know, on site preparing, and then when the building is completed in.

600
01:14:43,682 --> 01:14:52,484
you know, the summer of 2030 and the anticipation of it opening for the start of that school year, we'll still likely be on site completing site work.

601
01:14:52,504 --> 01:14:58,565
You know, the school will be operational, but we'll still be looking to finish up some site work.

602
01:14:58,605 --> 01:15:04,726
It's not uncommon for that to push into the following year, just from a weather standpoint.

603
01:15:04,746 --> 01:15:08,007
You know, we can't do final landscaping during the winter.

604
01:15:08,757 --> 01:15:14,522
Um, so, yes, it is in line with with other projects in the state.

605
01:15:15,283 --> 01:15:23,350
But that 2 and a half year period that you mentioned is maybe a little short, just because of the kind of nuances of how the construction will happen.

606
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:27,794
Jump in and say that.

607
01:15:29,749 --> 01:15:37,393
the, the building committee has taken the approach that we want to move as fast as it is responsible to move.

608
01:15:38,254 --> 01:15:41,716
And, um, that's for a number of reasons.

609
01:15:41,996 --> 01:15:47,198
So, so one is every day that you wait is a day where the costs increased on the backend, right?

610
01:15:47,219 --> 01:15:48,619
So we're really sensitive to that.

611
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:52,962
But the other is that we know that

612
01:15:54,853 --> 01:16:03,537
doing something here has to happen in order for education to continue to happen in this building as we go forward.

613
01:16:04,017 --> 01:16:12,301
And so our students that are in the building today deserve what we're going to be able to provide in a handful of years.

614
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:16,903
So I look at that as a sense of urgency that our kids deserve

615
01:16:17,863 --> 01:16:22,248
Our kids deserve for this project to magically be completed, and we can't do that.

616
01:16:22,368 --> 01:16:37,145
So what we can do is, and what we have done at every step of the way in eligibility and informing the project team, is move as fast as is reasonably responsible and as fast as we can.

617
01:16:39,468 --> 01:16:42,209
through these processes so that we can get going.

618
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:55,178
I also think on a site as complex as this and in a space where how the new building comes to be could be any number of things.

619
01:16:55,718 --> 01:17:04,204
Like we might see some level of a phase, like if you've been watching the Arlington project, there was a real phased implementation where they

620
01:17:05,004 --> 01:17:09,506
Were able to construct part of a building, they opened that part of the building and then they moved on to the next.

621
01:17:10,346 --> 01:17:13,407
None of those phasing questions can be answered yet because we don't.

622
01:17:13,947 --> 01:17:25,752
Know what we're building if we're building anything, but no, just know that as you look at that out timeline, there's so many variables that are going to go into the refinement of that timeline.

623
01:17:25,792 --> 01:17:25,952
Like.

624
01:17:27,112 --> 01:17:35,016
But my commitment to you is we're going to move as fast as we can so that kids can see the inside of something new sooner than later.

625
01:17:35,036 --> 01:17:38,218
Thanks, Jenny.

626
01:17:39,198 --> 01:17:48,043
So we've gotten a few questions both tonight and we got some earlier this afternoon about design elements, specifically a swimming pool.

627
01:17:48,103 --> 01:17:54,106
How do elements like the pool get decided on whether they're included in the space or whether they're not included in the space?

628
01:17:54,741 --> 01:17:58,382
That might not simply have to do with educational and ed plans.

629
01:18:05,224 --> 01:18:12,967
The pool is a very fluid component of the building that will be discussed.

630
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:17,892
a lot over the feasibility study period.

631
01:18:18,893 --> 01:18:22,960
It is a component of the building that is not reimbursable by the state.

632
01:18:24,141 --> 01:18:29,229
So that comes at a high cost for the taxpayers of Medford.

633
01:18:30,017 --> 01:18:34,419
As we start to weigh these options and look at it, we'll both look at it from a cost standpoint.

634
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:43,844
But as we look at feedback from the community and from the administration, that will also very much inform the decision as well.

635
01:18:43,904 --> 01:18:50,827
And it really will inevitably be the community's decision and the school building committee's decision.

636
01:18:53,018 --> 01:18:56,701
if that will be included and it is a very big cost factor.

637
01:18:56,741 --> 01:19:07,129
So it is something that we're looking at very closely but we know it is a hot ticket for the City of Medford that we are looking at closely.

638
01:19:09,171 --> 01:19:18,158
Community interest in our recreation spaces is very high and the pool is not an exception to that.

639
01:19:18,178 --> 01:19:18,218
So

640
01:19:19,952 --> 01:19:30,094
We've already received a slew of input around the pool and the tremendous strength that it provides to the community and the asset that it is.

641
01:19:31,154 --> 01:19:36,435
So very much on our minds trying to figure out the best way forward.

642
01:19:38,155 --> 01:19:42,256
But we're working at it.

643
01:19:42,276 --> 01:19:42,876
We're working at it.

644
01:19:44,376 --> 01:19:47,037
We're not allowed to say what will be because we don't know yet.

645
01:19:47,197 --> 01:19:49,337
But we hear you.

646
01:19:51,754 --> 01:19:56,655
And then we have a question that I think Principal Cabral or maybe Mr. Fowle would be able to answer.

647
01:19:56,695 --> 01:20:12,699
So in terms of the student voice throughout some of the educational planning and the visioning, what was it like getting their voices from vocational students and non-vocational students and kind of how those came together to help form some of the discussion that happened over the last few weeks?

648
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:17,903
I know I can speak.

649
01:20:19,264 --> 01:20:27,426
It was no surprise, but it was nice to hear the students really making the connection in their own learning to, you know, related to the CareerTech programs that they were part of.

650
01:20:28,406 --> 01:20:38,929
And it was nice to have them part of the, you know, as thought partners as to what a new space could look like and what the space they have now maybe lacks or, and then the benefits of the space they have now too.

651
01:20:39,969 --> 01:20:42,410
Like Suzanne said, it was very powerful to work with the students.

652
01:20:43,949 --> 01:20:53,214
Yeah, and just to piggyback off of that, we were really intentional of the students that we chose to be part of this from all different backgrounds, all different learning styles.

653
01:20:53,974 --> 01:21:05,240
And we were really intentional in making sure that we had 50% of the students CTE and then 50% that are part of the general education of Medford High School.

654
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:10,490
Thank you.

655
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:14,513
Um, we got we'll answer a few more questions before you wrap up today.

656
01:21:14,973 --> 01:21:15,173
Um.

657
01:21:16,014 --> 01:21:24,799
So, I think, obviously, the big question this won't be, um, we don't know the price yet for this project, but when will those discussions kind of take place and how will that.

658
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:27,580
Um, be communicated when that when that time comes.

659
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,322
So.

660
01:21:32,528 --> 01:21:39,313
We will start to look at like very high level cost per square foot estimates in this phase of the project.

661
01:21:40,214 --> 01:21:51,243
So we'll start to get a sense of cost, you know, starting in the next few weeks here, but we won't have a final budget set until the end of schematic design, which will be at the end of

662
01:21:52,764 --> 01:22:00,869
end of this year, really in early 2027, is when we anticipate to know what the actual budget will be.

663
01:22:00,929 --> 01:22:02,890
That's what we'll submit to the MSBA.

664
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:10,515
Once the MSBA approves it, that is what will be presented to the community for vote.

665
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:16,258
So we'll have that final cost estimate in early 2027.

666
01:22:16,338 --> 01:22:19,040
Well, can I just add to that?

667
01:22:22,113 --> 01:22:29,018
that we know and you can read in the news what high schools are costing.

668
01:22:29,038 --> 01:22:40,207
I would encourage everyone not to get like ahead of the train and let's work through this as the process is intended.

669
01:22:40,227 --> 01:22:51,596
And the reason that's important is because we do have a building that's very complicated and we do have a building that has some places where there's space that we would

670
01:22:51,976 --> 01:22:53,937
not get in a new building like the pool.

671
01:22:54,918 --> 01:22:58,019
And then we have other spaces, other things that are substantially undersized.

672
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:16,068
And we're doing a lot here, including centralizing our pre-K services, which will create space in other buildings and prevent future building projects that have to happen in those schools when those space considerations come up.

673
01:23:16,875 --> 01:23:23,485
Um, so there's a lot of moving parts going on when we get to the topic of, like, how much will it cost and who will pay?

674
01:23:23,505 --> 01:23:32,338
There's an important, you know, the in their partnership with us will pay for a significant portion of the expense of this building.

675
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:46,977
And then the community and the mayor's office, the city council, the school committee will be working together to say, now, how do we take what we know about what it will cost and what we know about how the.

676
01:23:47,798 --> 01:23:50,141
MSBA will participate in this project.

677
01:23:50,862 --> 01:24:06,411
And then what what is the rest of our revenue plan that gets us to paying this building and it's my hope that working together, we will be able to identify a revenue plan that does do more than just pass all of this cost onto the taxpayer.

678
01:24:06,431 --> 01:24:07,352
But also.

679
01:24:09,215 --> 01:24:24,210
really thinking through this as a very strategic effort, where we are making an investment now that will save us from many, many, many, many, many projects in the future as we go down the road.

680
01:24:24,290 --> 01:24:29,815
So the question of how much it will cost is a really complicated process.

681
01:24:30,776 --> 01:24:35,519
on the SMMA side and the left field side to come up with the actual how much will it cost.

682
01:24:35,859 --> 01:24:43,364
And then it's an equally complicated conversation for us to have as a community here in Medford to say, and how will we pay for our costs?

683
01:24:43,884 --> 01:24:49,267
Yes, there will be a debt exclusion in the spring of 2027 to green light this project forward.

684
01:24:50,548 --> 01:24:57,132
How big or how small that debt exclusion is, there's lots of things to do between now and then working together to figure that out.

685
01:24:59,747 --> 01:25:04,490
We know that, and if anybody knows any millionaires or billionaires, please send them my way.

686
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:10,394
I will tell them a compelling story about why they should invest in Medford High so that the taxpayers don't have to pay.

687
01:25:10,875 --> 01:25:22,383
So yeah, I just wanted to highlight that all of the elected officials in the city are thinking about this and are on board with making this project happen.

688
01:25:22,463 --> 01:25:28,567
So it's a really exciting, important time to be thoughtful and strategic and future-looking.

689
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:33,902
We'll take two more questions so we can kind of wrap up around 8 o'clock.

690
01:25:34,202 --> 01:25:51,653
We have a question about how the building gets designed so that we don't, both universally and inclusive design, so that we don't have to constantly think about retrofitting the building to make sure everyone feels included and is able to accessibly use the building.

691
01:25:54,835 --> 01:25:56,376
So I can start off here, Rosemary.

692
01:25:56,416 --> 01:25:58,598
You can jump in if you want to add anything.

693
01:25:59,687 --> 01:26:10,606
Universal design is really at the core of our design principles in terms of thinking about the building, we want to really provide the city of Medford.

694
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:14,832
in the district, a facility where everyone feels welcome.

695
01:26:15,052 --> 01:26:23,074
And that really starts with making sure that everyone can access the building and interact with the building in a whole myriad of ways.

696
01:26:23,354 --> 01:26:32,117
And that it really does take that universal design lens that is above and beyond just baseline accessibility, baseline code compliance.

697
01:26:32,957 --> 01:26:39,479
We wanna think about how does everyone arrive at the building and not feel like they are being othered as they are

698
01:26:40,199 --> 01:26:44,180
walking up to the front door as they are walking to their classroom or their shop space.

699
01:26:45,021 --> 01:26:56,344
It's a very holistic view that we'll be taking, and we really do take it at a very, very serious level in terms of making sure that we end up with a building that is welcoming to all.

700
01:26:58,165 --> 01:27:07,808
Yeah, and I think, Matt, just some examples that we put in there because we look at universal design as, again, as Matt's saying, kind of like a baseline, that that's

701
01:27:08,902 --> 01:27:37,230
just a given in everything that, in every part of the design and our approach, but going beyond that and looking at the, even just the, like the color temperature of lighting and how, you know, how are we really accommodating different, different sensitivities, you know, different, not just physical,

702
01:27:39,128 --> 01:27:45,954
physical space and accessibility, but also just neurodiverse populations as well.

703
01:27:46,074 --> 01:27:56,223
And so it's something that we do take very seriously and we continue to look at it from that lens throughout the design process.

704
01:27:58,605 --> 01:28:05,511
And then our last question for tonight, as we think about some of the submissions that we're gonna be giving the MSBA in the next couple of weeks,

705
01:28:05,861 --> 01:28:10,364
What kind of feedback does the MSBA give between the preliminary design and the final design?

706
01:28:15,347 --> 01:28:22,632
A lot of what they'll review in this very first submission, the PDP submission, it revolves around the educational program.

707
01:28:22,672 --> 01:28:26,634
Again, that's kind of the real key document that we're working on.

708
01:28:26,674 --> 01:28:34,620
They will certainly look at our space summary, which is just a breakout of all of the spaces in the building.

709
01:28:35,861 --> 01:28:40,204
They do have their own guidelines and processes and cost caps.

710
01:28:40,585 --> 01:28:45,469
So they'll make comments on what they consider to be an eligible or an ineligible space.

711
01:28:46,289 --> 01:28:53,396
So there will be a lot of kind of back and forth with the MSBA, kind of shifting things around and massaging the design.

712
01:28:54,416 --> 01:28:58,480
They don't get super detailed from like an actual design standpoint.

713
01:28:58,600 --> 01:28:59,421
And Matt Rice, you can

714
01:29:00,633 --> 01:29:17,277
um chime in from a design standpoint but um in these early phases that's that's really kind of the key focus um to you know get um you know get the project to a building that we want um

715
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,481
Yeah, I think you're correct, Matt.

716
01:29:21,801 --> 01:29:27,444
In terms of the actual design, the PDP submission is not heavy on design at all.

717
01:29:28,364 --> 01:29:35,168
There's high-level alternatives that we're putting in to establish cost models, but those are not design-specific at that point.

718
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:41,811
That feedback and input will come later in the process as we get towards the end of the PSR phase and certainly in schematic design.

719
01:29:42,432 --> 01:29:48,755
The commentary will be focused on the data and making sure that the space summary is in alignment

720
01:29:49,417 --> 01:30:01,181
with the educational plan so that, as you said, that we can make sure that we're building what we have said that we want to build or design what we plan for what we want to plan for.

721
01:30:03,461 --> 01:30:03,821
Awesome.

722
01:30:04,182 --> 01:30:04,982
Thank you very much.

723
01:30:05,002 --> 01:30:07,763
So I know we still have a few more questions out here.

724
01:30:08,663 --> 01:30:12,064
We'll take a look at these and make sure we get them on our website.

725
01:30:12,844 --> 01:30:15,425
If you'd like, you can also just throw them into the QR code.

726
01:30:15,445 --> 01:30:16,685
That would be super helpful.

727
01:30:16,805 --> 01:30:18,866
And if you leave your email and your question,

728
01:30:19,503 --> 01:30:26,365
and how we can make sure we get back to you so we can inform everybody about the project as much as we can at this time.

729
01:30:26,605 --> 01:30:30,106
Does anybody have any last words from our panelists team before we wrap up tonight?

730
01:30:30,126 --> 01:30:37,228
I'm just going to sneak in the answer to one more question, which is, are you reaching out to donors for something like the pool?

731
01:30:38,072 --> 01:30:40,455
If you know a donor, please send them my way.

732
01:30:40,475 --> 01:30:42,738
And yes, we will reach out.

733
01:30:42,818 --> 01:30:45,841
So a donor plan is definitely in the offing.

734
01:30:46,122 --> 01:30:52,609
And if you know who those folks are, please give me their number, and I'll make some phone calls.

735
01:30:52,810 --> 01:30:55,853
So yes, we will definitely be looking for donors.

736
01:30:57,885 --> 01:31:01,507
And then the QR code we'll make sure is posted on our website as well.

737
01:31:02,327 --> 01:31:11,592
And you can take a look there and then we'll be working to sort of like, weave all of this continuing set of questions into the website, because the questions are going to continue to evolve.

738
01:31:11,813 --> 01:31:14,454
So thank you everyone for coming.

739
01:31:14,514 --> 01:31:15,234
Thank you for.

740
01:31:16,635 --> 01:31:26,164
To the left field team and to estimate May and for Dr Lucy and her team and to will for being an extraordinary moderator of the of the many Q and A's here.

741
01:31:27,405 --> 01:31:28,687
I'm excited about this project.

742
01:31:28,827 --> 01:31:37,274
I hope to see many of you live in person on Wednesday and my information, my personal.

743
01:31:38,394 --> 01:31:44,302
or my school committee email is on the school committee website and you are welcome to reach out anytime you want to talk.

744
01:31:44,763 --> 01:31:48,288
I could talk your ear off about all this all day long while these guys do the real work.

745
01:31:48,368 --> 01:31:51,493
So please don't hesitate to reach out and we will see you soon.

746
01:31:51,953 --> 01:31:52,174
Thanks.

747
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:53,095
Thank you.
