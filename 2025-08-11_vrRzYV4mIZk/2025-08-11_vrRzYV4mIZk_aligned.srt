1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:01,352
All right, good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:01,952 --> 00:00:07,696
My name is Emily Hedeman, and I am the chair for the Medford Community Development Board.

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,357
And I'm going to call the meeting to order.

4
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,859
Let's begin with some obligatory procedural matters.

5
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:19,062
This hearing of the Medford Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means.

6
00:00:19,763 --> 00:00:26,887
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings.

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,653
A reminder that given the remote nature of this meeting, tonight all votes from the board will be made by roll call.

Danielle or Christian, would you be able to drop that into the chat?

15
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:18,576
Um, we're going to start with roll call attendance.

16
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,997
Uh, vice chair, Peter Calves.

17
00:01:22,497 --> 00:01:22,857
Present.

18
00:01:24,658 --> 00:01:25,478
Uh, Sabrina Alpino.

John Anderson.

00:01:29,495 --> 00:01:32,556
Present.

21
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:35,017
Adam Behrens.

22
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:36,717
Present.

23
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:39,418

24
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:40,838
Present.

25
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:49,041
Uh, we have a new member, um, who I'd like to, uh, welcome, uh, Dina Collegero.

26
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:50,741
Um, welcome Dina.

27
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:53,262
This is your first roll call attendance.

28
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:53,902
Are you here?

29
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:54,762
I'm here.

30
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:55,423
I'm here.

31
00:01:55,443 --> 00:01:55,723
Great.

32
00:01:55,903 --> 00:01:56,483
Good to have you.

33
00:01:57,305 --> 00:01:58,825
and myself, Chair Emily Hedeman.

34
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:06,927
Before I pass it off to Danielle to introduce any staff, I'm going to pass it off to Vice Chair Peter Kalves.

35
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,348
This is Peter's last meeting.

36
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:14,389
His term expired and he is elected not to seek reappointment.

37
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,291
On behalf of the board, I want to just thank him so much for his contribution.

38
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:21,811
It's been a pleasure to work beside him on the board.

39
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:23,392
We have benefited greatly

40
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:28,837
from his knowledge as a professional engineer, as a transportation engineer.

41
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:40,802
And I really appreciate his strong approach to ethical involvement, as well as balanced involvement in topics.

42
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:43,983
And with that, I'll hand it off to Peter, to whatever he wants to say.

43
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:45,964
Thank you.

44
00:02:45,984 --> 00:02:47,224
Thank you, Emily.

45
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:47,845
Yeah.

46
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:50,066
I don't know.

47
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:50,746
It's been an honor.

48
00:02:53,968 --> 00:03:03,651
And a privilege to serve on this board for the past couple of years, and I've had some personal and professional circumstances that have made it kind of unsustainable to keep going right now.

49
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:06,972
But I will always be glad for the involvement I was able to have.

50
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:18,375
And I'm sure you'll see me back in these meetings, whether making a comment as a member of the public or showing up on the other side of the table with a proponent in my day job.

51
00:03:18,395 --> 00:03:23,297
So I'd just like to thank everyone for all the work they put in and all the

52
00:03:24,845 --> 00:03:28,009
vision people have for the city and to keep making the city better.

53
00:03:28,029 --> 00:03:29,371
Yeah, thank you.

54
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:33,597
Thanks, Peter.

55
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:34,959
I'll see you on the orange line.

56
00:03:36,562 --> 00:03:39,406
And I'd also like to remind you that you're eligible for two

57
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,870
two, three-year terms.

58
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,771
Those don't have to be concurrent.

59
00:03:43,911 --> 00:03:55,294
So if at any time you're interested in rejoining the Community Development Board, submit an application, and as vacancies arise, you may be considered.

60
00:03:57,174 --> 00:03:58,675
So this is not goodbye, this is see you later.

61
00:03:58,695 --> 00:04:00,295
Yeah, thanks.

62
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:03,136
And I believe you're jumping off the call now, is that correct?

63
00:04:03,156 --> 00:04:05,676
Yes, I do have to jump, sorry.

64
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:06,817
Thank you, Peter.

65
00:04:06,857 --> 00:04:07,437
Have a nice evening.

66
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:08,237
Yeah, you too.

67
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,031
Danielle, can you introduce any staff at the meeting or on the call?

68
00:04:19,453 --> 00:04:19,693
Yes.

69
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:21,054
Thank you, Madam Chair.

70
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:29,537
Myself, Danielle Evans, Senior Planner in the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability, and our graduate student intern, Christian Cepeda-Lepofsky.

71
00:04:29,557 --> 00:04:32,278
I think that is everyone we have tonight.

72
00:04:32,298 --> 00:04:34,779
Everyone else is on well-deserved vacations.

73
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,201
That's very common time for time off.

74
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,142
Um, so before we begin, I want to run down the agenda for tonight's meeting.

75
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:50,344
Um, we are going to take the agenda items slightly out of order.

76
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:57,769
Um, I want to talk about item number four, which is zoning updates.

77
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:06,093
As members of the board and members of the public on this call may be aware, um, there's been a lot of, of changes.

78
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:06,153
Um,

79
00:05:09,827 --> 00:05:22,214
a lot of kind of announcements made by city council, the mayor, that have a significant impact on our community development board's kind of timeline and potentially involvement in the process.

80
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:26,716
So was hoping to get an update on that.

81
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:37,202
So after discussing a new path forward, we're going to reopen the public hearings for residential districts, the accessory dwelling units, and squares.

82
00:05:38,913 --> 00:05:50,078
For squares, I'd like us largely to focus on Medford Square as there's some things in motion in West Medford Square that we'll talk about later.

83
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,000
This will be for board deliberation only.

84
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,281
We're not planning to take public comment.

85
00:05:57,101 --> 00:05:59,882
We've taken public comment up until July 23rd.

86
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:06,545
And the reason for that is because the board needed time to process public comment so that we can provide

87
00:06:07,888 --> 00:06:15,434
um, input to the consultant who is not here tonight, uh, due to some of those city council and mayoral challenges.

88
00:06:15,454 --> 00:06:22,599
Um, but there will be opportunities to make comments in the future.

89
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:34,649
So if you joined as a member of the public, you're welcome to, to stay on, um, and listen to our deliberations, um, you know, and submit feedback about that, but comments

90
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:38,550
won't be reflected into the next iteration.

91
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:47,172
We're also going to conclude our meeting with a discussion in the executive session regarding a pending legal case against the board.

92
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:49,753
So that's the rundown for tonight.

93
00:06:51,353 --> 00:06:57,055
I also want to add that this is likely my last meeting as a member of the Community Development Board.

94
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:01,712
I'm not getting emotional.

95
00:07:01,752 --> 00:07:02,052
You are.

96
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:06,256
It's been so great serving.

97
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,179
But my term has expired.

98
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,723
And I think it's time for new involvement and new leadership on the board.

99
00:07:14,743 --> 00:07:17,265
I hope that I've brought a

100
00:07:18,996 --> 00:07:24,199
inclusive and fair approach to the proceedings that we've had before us.

101
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:27,500
I would encourage future members to take that same approach.

102
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:33,343
Remember that your perspective is not the only perspective, and you are serving the citizens of Medford.

103
00:07:33,644 --> 00:07:34,684
You are not serving the mayor.

104
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:36,405
You are not serving the city council.

105
00:07:37,105 --> 00:07:38,206
You're not even serving yourself.

106
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:42,708
You are serving your fellow citizens, and I want you all to take that very seriously.

107
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:48,051
Whether you're a new member, Dina, who I have no doubt will do very well on the board,

108
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:52,849
or somebody sitting on this call who is considering applying for one of the spots.

109
00:07:54,431 --> 00:08:02,238
I'd encourage the city, whether it's the council or the mayor, to take a collaborative and professional approach to moving forward.

110
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:09,105
We can only do this if we all move forward together at a reasonable pace that brings everyone along.

111
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:12,568
It's going to take a lot of time and a lot of money to do that.

112
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,631
And that's what Medfar deserves.

113
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:17,293
And if we can't do that, then we shouldn't do it at all.

114
00:08:17,313 --> 00:08:23,438
And I know those are strong words, but we should get this right for the time.

115
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:30,404
So I'd encourage more funding, more collaboration, more direct communication between all parties.

116
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:36,408
And with that, I'll step down from my soapbox and move into zoning updates.

117
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,771
Danielle, do you have any updates for us?

118
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:41,072
Thank you, Joc.

119
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:43,669
Thank you madam chair.

120
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:50,401
So, I attended the city council last night that went until almost 2 am the.

121
00:08:51,923 --> 00:08:55,930
President bears resolution for the shared path forward was heard around.

122
00:08:57,921 --> 00:08:58,762
1230 a.m.

123
00:08:59,562 --> 00:09:02,584
and what I was able to absorb at that hour.

124
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:06,607
So they, they table the, um, the quarter.

125
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,428
So they did not refer that out.

126
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:24,860
Um, so that, um, gives us some more breathing room to handle the public hearings that are before you right now, like, as you were this, this currently 3 open public hearings, the neighborhood residential urban residential zoning, which is 1.

127
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:33,086
Then there's the accessory dwelling units amendment was the 2nd, 1 and then the 3rd, 1, which is combined West Medford square in Medford square.

128
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:40,589
I know that it had been talked about to in the.

129
00:09:42,229 --> 00:09:50,532
In President there's resolution to move the residential zoning towards the end of the process.

130
00:09:50,732 --> 00:09:53,153
I think he wanted a spring 2026 timeline.

131
00:09:54,901 --> 00:10:00,543
I'm very happy that this approach will be taken.

132
00:10:00,563 --> 00:10:06,945
I've been saying that all along that the residential should come after we've done the squares in the quarters.

133
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:11,567
And I'm glad that finally, everyone is getting on the same page.

134
00:10:11,587 --> 00:10:12,267
So.

135
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:27,824
The in his contract currently it is, it is not technically expired, but it has does not have any funding for it.

136
00:10:28,365 --> 00:10:28,685
So.

137
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:43,514
So, I am not sure that the cadence or the pace of their involvement once it does, if, and once it gets extended.

138
00:10:47,308 --> 00:10:49,809
So, that's pretty much what's going on now.

139
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:59,035
I wish I had more to offer, but the city council did not refer anything back to committee for further study.

140
00:11:00,636 --> 00:11:05,038
They didn't withdraw anything or sever anything, but.

141
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,940
So, status quo for now.

142
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:10,656
and what a status quo it is.

143
00:11:12,617 --> 00:11:21,181
So what I'm hearing is that tonight, for the board deliberations, when we reopen the public hearing, we can still synthesize public comment.

144
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:28,544
We can still provide insight to Innocent Associates, regardless of the path moving forward.

145
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:33,686
Because I think the board, if you agree with me, shake your head.

146
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,067
If you don't, raise your hand.

147
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:39,068
But I think the amount of work that

148
00:11:39,796 --> 00:11:52,583
Innocent associates as well as the public have put in to this point forward deserves to be recognized so that we can still kind of discuss, put together some firm recommendations and then go from there.

149
00:11:56,545 --> 00:11:56,825
Cool.

150
00:11:57,205 --> 00:11:59,927
We'll make the best decision for ourselves with everything we know right now.

151
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:05,071
Okay, thank you for that update, Danielle.

152
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:05,811
I really appreciate it.

153
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:10,752
And I also appreciate the time and effort that you and the rest of the staff members have been putting in.

154
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:15,533
It's a lot of late nights and long hours and it has not gone unrecognized.

155
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:16,534
So thank you for that.

156
00:12:16,554 --> 00:12:17,714
Thank you.

157
00:12:21,895 --> 00:12:32,197
So we're gonna move into our next item, continued public hearings for neighborhood and urban residential accessory dwelling units and Medford Square and West Medford Square districts.

158
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:44,872
As a reminder, this is the sixth meeting for the continued public hearing that was opened on April 2nd regarding the proposed zoning amendment for the creation of neighborhood and urban residential zoning districts.

159
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:51,755
This is our third meeting for the continued public hearings that was opened on June 18th regarding the accessory dwelling units.

160
00:12:52,655 --> 00:13:02,318
And this is the fourth meeting for the continued public hearings that was opened on June 4th regarding the proposed zoning amendment for the creation of Medford Square and West Medford Square districts.

161
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:10,999
I do see in my notes that Sabrina missed the neighborhood residential urban residential and ADUs.

162
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:19,421
Peter missed squares as Peter has left the meeting and his spots being replaced and Sabrina is not here tonight.

163
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:23,162
We don't need to discuss the Mullen rule right now.

164
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:32,664
So with that, I'm going to open this up to the board for our deliberations.

165
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:47,045
As I laid out in my logistical email yesterday, what I'm planning is for people who are interested, board members who are interested to have like five or 10 minutes to share their insight.

166
00:13:49,026 --> 00:13:54,848
Everybody will share their insight kind of sequentially, and then we'll engage in discussion as a larger group.

167
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:02,231
So if anybody wants to go first, no pressure.

168
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:12,371
And Dina, you're welcome to participate in this discussion as well, or share some reflection, especially coming from the other side.

169
00:14:22,598 --> 00:14:23,639
John, you wanna kick us off?

170
00:14:28,182 --> 00:14:29,003
Okay, thank you.

171
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,265
I'll try to be brief.

172
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:39,416
For one thing, I've only attended a few meetings, but I would make a couple of general comments.

173
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:52,539
One, I'm sort of, it seems like it's sort of a contradiction to have a public meeting for public, particularly when it's for public input, and to do it only over Zoom.

174
00:14:52,559 --> 00:15:01,382
Now, the two public comment meetings I've been involved in were both hybrid, but I understand that's a bit unusual.

175
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:10,408
But I think something is lost when public input is received only via Zoom.

176
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:15,950
I mean, there's a feeling at a true public meeting, there's the vibe of the meeting.

177
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:20,032
The board has to look at the people.

178
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:22,359
The people could look at the board.

179
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,920
They could see who they're talking to.

180
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:32,965
If you're just talking to some little pictures up on the screen, it's not really the same thing, particularly if they're blacked out.

181
00:15:34,186 --> 00:15:35,167
So that's one comment.

182
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:44,352
Another comment, one of the things I've struggled with as we deal with these proposals is some kind of overview or synopsis.

183
00:15:47,454 --> 00:15:48,635
There's a lot of detail.

184
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:59,407
but to get a better idea of the thinking that's gone behind the proposal would be a big help for me.

185
00:15:59,427 --> 00:16:07,471
Uh, I would like to, I think it would be advantageous to see other city agencies involved in some of the discussions.

186
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:14,175
For example, we had the commission, the DPW commissioner, uh,

187
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:18,056
at a recent meeting and I think that was very helpful.

188
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:25,262
I'd also like to see a commission like the historical commission involved in at least an informal way.

189
00:16:28,264 --> 00:16:40,453
The comprehensive plan talks about respect for historic context, excuse me, and I don't see any of that

190
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:48,520
in any of the zoning proposals except for the historic, what's it called?

191
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,062
The historic rehabilitation?

192
00:16:51,082 --> 00:16:52,523
Historic conversion.

193
00:16:53,123 --> 00:16:54,524
Historic conversion, right.

194
00:16:55,465 --> 00:17:03,732
And I don't know how that would conflict with the commission's work, which regulates what can be done to historic houses.

195
00:17:06,514 --> 00:17:08,856
Just as a simple example, an ADU is,

196
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:14,660
there has to be separate entrances for the ADU.

197
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:22,883
Well, in many houses, you would have to make some exterior changes to the ADU, to the building to support an ADU.

198
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,444
Of course, the simplest thing would be steps and balconies.

199
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:32,466
But the historical commission might want to weigh in on that.

200
00:17:32,546 --> 00:17:39,408
Also, I don't know what authority the historical commission would have if the ADUs are by right.

201
00:17:40,763 --> 00:17:41,784
That's just an example.

202
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:47,088
I guess that's all I'll say for now.

203
00:17:47,949 --> 00:17:50,771
I've been really happy to participate in this process.

204
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:52,553
It's been quite a learning experience.

205
00:17:53,514 --> 00:18:01,300
But I think some of the things I've suggested could make the process move more smoothly and expeditiously in the future.

206
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,563
Thank you.

207
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:11,435
Um, that's, I think that's really helpful feedback for the general process.

208
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:24,185
Um, as somebody who's participated in the hybrid meetings, um, who works full time and has other personal obligations, it was a, it was a significant challenge.

209
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:31,611
Um, and I think, you know, we need to be very measured in terms of the obligations that we're asking of our board members.

210
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:36,615
So we can retain a diverse membership, um, that includes people with young families,

211
00:18:37,605 --> 00:18:40,186
people with full-time jobs, people with other commitments.

212
00:18:41,346 --> 00:18:46,708
I agree, it was great to see everybody in person, but that's just kind of some feedback from the other side.

213
00:18:47,488 --> 00:18:59,152
I do also want to remind the board that the goal for this meeting is to try to give direction to the consultant in terms of where to improve these proposals based on all the public comment.

214
00:18:59,612 --> 00:19:03,253
So things that are around like meeting location,

215
00:19:06,865 --> 00:19:12,387
You know, that's not really within the kind of purview of innocent or whoever.

216
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:17,588
So just providing some parameters for what we talk about.

217
00:19:25,271 --> 00:19:26,571
Adam, I see that you came off mute.

218
00:19:28,132 --> 00:19:32,513
I'm just going to need her to go next if we're each going around.

219
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:34,389
Yeah, that would be awesome.

220
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:34,969
Thank you.

221
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:35,269
Okay.

222
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:35,709
Awesome.

223
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,512
Yeah, I guess we're regarding the corridors.

224
00:19:40,592 --> 00:19:41,953
I think 1 of the things that stood out from.

225
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:47,416
A previous meeting was hold on have quarters been referred to us.

226
00:19:48,893 --> 00:19:49,113
No.

227
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:51,074
Oh, sorry, the squares, sorry.

228
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:52,114
The squares, okay.

229
00:19:52,355 --> 00:19:52,915
Yeah, sorry.

230
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:57,657
But it was the discussion around sort of the boundaries of those squares.

231
00:19:57,977 --> 00:20:15,085
And I thought that that was probably like one of the most helpful inputs that we got from community members, which was local knowledge at like specific buildings along the edges where maybe it made sense or maybe it didn't make sense.

232
00:20:16,421 --> 00:20:32,970
And so I think that is something that I would find really valuable to feel confident that the way that these are budding to the residential neighborhoods are doing so in the spirit of what the community wants.

233
00:20:36,495 --> 00:20:39,399
So that is one of the main things that maybe stood out.

234
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,070
I think the other thing that has stood out, and I'm not sure the best solution for it, but...

235
00:20:48,098 --> 00:21:04,971
It does feel like the comments are bifurcated from the public, where on one hand, there's a desire to move more slowly, do the zoning more in line with what currently exists.

236
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:13,257
Then on the other hand, there's maybe a contingent that is much more pro-development or they do want higher density.

237
00:21:15,636 --> 00:21:21,632
And so I've struggled with just how to reconcile the left brain and the right brain there.

238
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,212
in terms of what's best for Medford.

239
00:21:25,372 --> 00:21:29,876
I think you said it well, Emily, where I don't want to advocate for my own beliefs.

240
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:34,740
I want to advocate for what is best for Medford and what the community wants.

241
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:43,147
And so I think there was some back and forth on just different heights, especially in the squares.

242
00:21:46,049 --> 00:22:11,962
And maybe I'm just expressing kind of questions I still have, which is just how do I get confidence that, OK, a four-story limit versus a six-story limit is really what's in the best interest of what people want, and just whether there's a silent contingent as well that hasn't been involved that might have an opinion.

243
00:22:16,221 --> 00:22:32,955
And I think the last piece that had stood out that I think that they've done a good job with, it's less maybe a guidance for NS or anybody, but just bringing things up to code for what's currently there, that the current buildings just don't actually match what's even in the zoning anyways.

244
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:37,679
And I want to make sure that

245
00:22:38,998 --> 00:22:50,564
The zoning that we proposed just doesn't get stale immediately, and we end up in that same spot where it's like, oh man, within five years, it's not even reflective.

246
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:58,868
I work in tech, and so there's just a lot of change going on, and I think it's hard to account for that.

247
00:22:58,948 --> 00:23:03,430
And so I would love to be able to pull in as much flexibility as we could to the zoning.

248
00:23:04,695 --> 00:23:21,893
From a personal perspective, I think that defaults to just trying to err towards letting property owners do more of what they want with the property that they have and being a little bit less dogmatic about what needs to go in different places, maybe mixed use being a little bit more prevalent.

249
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,701
But I think there's a lot of changes that are just happening generally that the city is going to have to account for.

250
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:37,704
I think I saw the first autonomous vehicle driving around for training with Google, the Waymo.

251
00:23:37,724 --> 00:23:40,705
And so all the concerns around traffic patterns, all the concerns around parking.

252
00:23:44,486 --> 00:23:50,490
I just want to really make sure we're being forward-looking with maybe other things that are going on.

253
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,453
So I'll stop there, but that's my high-level thoughts right now.

254
00:23:58,335 --> 00:23:58,935
Thank you, Adam.

255
00:24:09,022 --> 00:24:10,022
Ben, I see your hand.

256
00:24:11,273 --> 00:24:12,574
Yep, I'll take my turn.

257
00:24:12,674 --> 00:24:13,475
Thanks, Emily.

258
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:16,917
I want to echo a couple of things.

259
00:24:17,678 --> 00:24:24,443
I agree with Emily's feedback about hybrid meetings being a nice option, but I do think in-person is great.

260
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:28,646
I'm in California right now on a work trip, so it's helpful to me to have hybrid as an option.

261
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:38,253
I don't want to belabor the process stuff, but if you'll allow me a minute, I would encourage

262
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:56,121
City Council and the other sort of powers that be, like, to the points that were already made, it'd be nice to sort of get the big picture, you know, why some of these proposals are good for the citizens of Medford.

263
00:24:56,181 --> 00:24:56,862
I think that was a

264
00:24:59,182 --> 00:25:11,945
frustrating thing over the last several months was to have to listen to a bunch of residents who didn't feel like they understood why any of this was being proposed or what benefit there would be for the residents and people that are already here.

265
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:25,729
So, as part of whatever plays out over the next six months or so, I hope that there's a campaign for lack of a better term to sort of advocate or state the benefits.

266
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:40,557
Um, I do think that, you know, I read the comments from our elected officials, uh, and and sort of civic employees, um, that are in the public folder, uh, you know, hearing from the fire chief and the police chief and the.

267
00:25:41,783 --> 00:25:49,131
At the last in-person meeting, we had the representative of the people that work for the fire department.

268
00:25:49,191 --> 00:25:55,578
And it's just very clear that there's a lot of really critical stakeholder groups that were not involved.

269
00:25:56,379 --> 00:25:59,923
And so I think that some more robust

270
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:21,915
stakeholder engagement, not just with the public, but also with sort of critical public servants, you know, just making sure that we're setting the city up in a thoughtful way that takes input from the people who spend, you know, spend their working days working on behalf of the citizens of Medford.

271
00:26:23,136 --> 00:26:26,619
That also includes traffic and, you know, potential MBTA

272
00:26:27,748 --> 00:26:28,449
collaboration.

273
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:35,833
I agree with Adam that we should try to be forward looking with how much, you know, technology is evolving around power generation and transportation.

274
00:26:36,974 --> 00:26:48,661
Um, but if I had, um, and I do have some specific feedback about the, the, the proposals, Emily, so I'll get there in just a second, but, um, the, the number one bit of feedback, you know, I've been on this board for about a year.

275
00:26:48,681 --> 00:26:53,264
Um, the zoning stuff sort of took over the agenda in 2025, I would say.

276
00:26:53,284 --> 00:26:53,324
Um,

277
00:26:56,803 --> 00:27:12,517
And the biggest thing that I would like to get guidance on from city council or the city is clarity on who's accountable for actually doing the work associated to, you know, a comprehensive zoning update.

278
00:27:12,637 --> 00:27:12,837
Right.

279
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:15,760
We've had innocent associates and I do want to sort of applaud them.

280
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:21,305
They were, you know, kind of thrown into a tough situation and I think that they were very professional and did the best that they could.

281
00:27:21,365 --> 00:27:23,327
And I appreciated that.

282
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:28,878
But, you know, for example, right now their work is done for the time being.

283
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:35,682
And so if we give specific feedback today, like who's actually accountable for incorporating that into an updated plan?

284
00:27:35,842 --> 00:27:38,864
Who synthesizes that and gives it back to the city council?

285
00:27:38,884 --> 00:27:44,688
Is that city staff that's already sort of short-staffed and pulling sort of really long hours?

286
00:27:45,608 --> 00:27:47,049
That doesn't seem appropriate.

287
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:52,453
So that's my biggest sort of thing is like, who's actually accountable from here on in

288
00:27:53,368 --> 00:27:55,009
for the details of the work.

289
00:27:55,049 --> 00:28:05,278
And I would encourage the city not to just sort of roll from one sort of short-term consulting contract into the next one without some real clarity on like who's accountable for what.

290
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:21,732
And if it's the CDB, I mean, several times at several points over the last meetings, you know, over the last couple of months, it's been like, well, if the CDB sort of, if the community development board thinks that certain things should happen in certain places, then you can propose that.

291
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:26,284
And that's very hard to do in a public meeting, right?

292
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,324
It's very hard to have like a working session.

293
00:28:28,344 --> 00:28:30,866
It's also not very respectful of the public's time.

294
00:28:31,786 --> 00:28:45,532
So if it's the Community Development Board that's responsible for sort of the details of the work to get it to a point that it represents sort of the public's feedback, that's a pretty big ask.

295
00:28:46,770 --> 00:29:05,620
this board especially with so much turnover like that doesn't actually seem appropriate to me but if if that is the request then maybe we need to think about how to have more working sessions or more executive sessions or something where you know we can sit and talk about specific addresses on specific streets and

296
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,463
you know, sort of do that in a way that's more of a working group versus a public meeting.

297
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:14,967
So I, you know, I just, I, I've been a little frustrated by the sort of lack of clarity on who's accountable.

298
00:29:15,407 --> 00:29:16,508
I'll get off my soapbox.

299
00:29:16,968 --> 00:29:21,472
I do have some feedback on the Medford square, um, proposal.

300
00:29:21,572 --> 00:29:29,678
I think there's some parcels on garden street, Ashland street and governors have that I think are worth, um,

301
00:29:30,797 --> 00:29:42,290
worth a conversation as to whether sort of mixed use residential, there's some specifically some historic homes on Governor's Ave, Ashland Street, which is where I live.

302
00:29:43,311 --> 00:29:50,779
So I'm very familiar with the specific parcels and a couple on Garden Street that are currently slated to be up zoned to either

303
00:29:52,418 --> 00:29:59,140
you know, and our three or, um, I think, sorry, um, uh, mixed use or urban residential.

304
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,481
And, um, I provided some feedback, um, in an email.

305
00:30:04,681 --> 00:30:07,061
I don't think that was incorporated into an updated plan.

306
00:30:07,101 --> 00:30:08,202
So I'm happy to get into that.

307
00:30:08,282 --> 00:30:10,642
I don't know if it makes sense to go through specific addresses.

308
00:30:10,682 --> 00:30:13,163
That's probably not the best use of time right now, but, um,

309
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:37,187
i do have a couple of a couple of specific addresses like that is helpful information um maybe it's not something because i don't see us like i don't see us voting on anything in front of us um this evening um but and i i want to give a shout out to john anderson too because he did some really really

310
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,261
thoughtful groundwork on West Medford Square, highlighting specific addresses.

311
00:30:41,862 --> 00:30:52,025
And I think that sort of work is like step one, depending on the true accountability of the work in front of us, as you alluded to, Ben.

312
00:30:52,125 --> 00:31:02,749
But if you have specific addresses and you want to flash them on screen, that's great, because then we can incorporate those to the feedback that we share with the consultant.

313
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:13,199
And part of the reason we're doing it as part of this meeting is because, you know, we as a board cannot deliberate absent the public, we have to have proper notices.

314
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:20,407
And it's a violation of open meeting law if we were to kind of collaborate offline so.

315
00:31:21,475 --> 00:31:22,416
you know, for better or for worse.

316
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:28,539
I agree with you, might not be the most efficient way to do it, but it's the legal way to do it.

317
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:28,839
I know.

318
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:29,740
Yeah.

319
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,683
And I, if I could respond to that for 30 seconds, Emily, I, that's totally fine.

320
00:31:35,503 --> 00:31:46,870
Um, and, and just to be clear, like, I don't think that me or this board is the right board to sort of go parcel by parcel through the city, but I think there was some clear, clear areas that needed more work.

321
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:50,933
And, you know, the feedback that we got over the last couple of months was like, well, if you have feedback, like you can,

322
00:31:51,453 --> 00:32:20,492
you can write it down you can do the work you know so being asked to do the work without really sort of having a form to do it um just a little frustrating um i sent the i sent the specific um parcel information to danielle a little while back it was going to be passed over to the consultants i'm sure it was and it's you know it's probably sort of pending um whatever the next steps are with them so um if we want to i can go back through them but i'm not sure that's the best use of time yes

323
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:23,035
Legally, what do we have to do here, Danielle?

324
00:32:23,055 --> 00:32:26,176
Do you want me to read them out?

325
00:32:26,216 --> 00:32:27,956
I mean, I can read them out for the record.

326
00:32:27,976 --> 00:32:29,777
No, I did forward those.

327
00:32:29,797 --> 00:32:35,779
Just to be clear, reading them out does not mean that the modification to the plan is confirmed.

328
00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:38,799
It just means we're asking the consultant to revisit.

329
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:43,721
So if your address is mentioned, that does not mean something's a done deal.

330
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:48,523
It just means we're going to try this approach.

331
00:32:49,283 --> 00:32:49,963
And if we get it wrong,

332
00:32:50,683 --> 00:32:53,286
we'll have another opportunity for feedback.

333
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:56,671
Does that sound fair?

334
00:32:57,772 --> 00:32:57,933
Yeah.

335
00:32:58,113 --> 00:33:00,476
Sorry, Danielle.

336
00:33:00,997 --> 00:33:02,138
Through the chair to Ben.

337
00:33:02,158 --> 00:33:02,238
Yeah.

338
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,552
If I didn't respond to you, I apologize.

339
00:33:08,173 --> 00:33:11,877
I did forward that to the consultants and to other staff.

340
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:14,079
You did no, you responded.

341
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:16,482
I just don't think it's been incorporated into any update.

342
00:33:16,802 --> 00:33:19,545
So, yeah, nothing's yeah, nothing's been incorporated.

343
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:20,786
We don't have any updates.

344
00:33:22,428 --> 00:33:24,731
This is all consolidating to when.

345
00:33:27,623 --> 00:33:34,708
With the squares, I don't know when those are coming, since we don't have a contract, and the consultants were directed to stop working.

346
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:43,995
So, why don't I just read them off and share my feedback, given that this is open to the public, if that's okay, it will only take a minute.

347
00:33:44,936 --> 00:33:48,678
And this is sort of specific to specific parcels.

348
00:33:48,738 --> 00:33:56,024
And as Emily said, if you live in one of these, by all means, you should share a comment at the appropriate time.

349
00:33:56,104 --> 00:33:59,387
So this is just me sort of with my own judgment.

350
00:33:59,447 --> 00:34:06,092
But 7 Hillside Avenue is listed as mixed use in the proposal.

351
00:34:06,772 --> 00:34:10,856
That's a historic multifamily home on the corner of Hillside and Grandview.

352
00:34:11,636 --> 00:34:13,438
It doesn't pass the sort of just like

353
00:34:15,283 --> 00:34:19,388
I would say sort of like a gut check of whether that should be a mixed use.

354
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:21,391
That was 7 Hillside.

355
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:22,492
7 Hillside.

356
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:32,023
So I would encourage another look, you know, maybe if there was like, you know, a dentist office or CPA or something that wasn't, you know, but it is a historic, beautiful home.

357
00:34:32,043 --> 00:34:33,485
17 Garden Street.

358
00:34:36,178 --> 00:34:38,380
Similar historic single family home.

359
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,021
This is sort of right behind, you know, pure hockey.

360
00:34:41,882 --> 00:34:43,403
So it is very close to the square.

361
00:34:43,423 --> 00:34:48,066
And I'm not saying it shouldn't be up zoned, but a historic home.

362
00:34:48,727 --> 00:34:56,992
Same with 11 Garden Street and 10 Porter Road, 14 to 16 Porter Road and 19 Governors Ave.

363
00:35:03,287 --> 00:35:09,989
Those are the ones that I think are worthy of an extra look, just to confirm.

364
00:35:10,009 --> 00:35:15,411
7 Hillside, 17 Garden, 11 Garden, 10 Porter, 14 through 16 Porter, 19 Governors.

365
00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:16,451
You got it.

366
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:17,412
OK.

367
00:35:17,832 --> 00:35:18,072
Yes.

368
00:35:18,092 --> 00:35:19,072
I like it.

369
00:35:23,594 --> 00:35:24,174
That's it for me.

370
00:35:24,234 --> 00:35:25,434
Thanks for the time, Emily.

371
00:35:25,995 --> 00:35:26,315
Of course.

372
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:29,976
Sorry.

373
00:35:34,273 --> 00:35:34,994
Did you call on me?

374
00:35:35,014 --> 00:35:37,156
Yeah, if you want to.

375
00:35:37,196 --> 00:35:39,177
I mean, just going through.

376
00:35:39,678 --> 00:35:43,061
Yeah, I'm muted too.

377
00:35:43,761 --> 00:35:47,765
Okay, I'm not sure kind of what my status is currently.

378
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:49,966
Just comment.

379
00:35:50,727 --> 00:35:52,969
Okay.

380
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:58,514
And I have been part of this process, kind of since the beginning.

381
00:35:58,534 --> 00:35:58,594
And

382
00:36:01,782 --> 00:36:09,746
I do want to comment on the actual like, big picture process and agree with some of the comments about.

383
00:36:11,247 --> 00:36:14,649
It's hard to know what we're doing and what we're able to do.

384
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:19,772
We are legally not allowed to work among ourselves without the public.

385
00:36:20,632 --> 00:36:23,634
We are not allowed to have any meetings other than the ones that.

386
00:36:24,774 --> 00:36:26,075
Are publicly noticed and.

387
00:36:28,998 --> 00:36:31,079
We are getting very conflict.

388
00:36:31,379 --> 00:36:33,760
We got very clear guidance from city council.

389
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:46,605
The mayor provided some guidance from when she was on city council and some emails throughout the process, and then said she was not aware of anything and gave us very different guidance.

390
00:36:47,765 --> 00:36:52,567
And now we do not have any professional support to actually go through.

391
00:36:53,514 --> 00:37:15,648
building by building and do public research and do public outreach, both of which are the things that I would describe as the two things I've heard most clearly from the public, that we want to be detailed, we want to be specific, we want to honor not just the theory of the city we all live in and love, but the actual reality of it.

392
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:22,572
We want to put in the effort to make sure that those of us who have full-time jobs and families

393
00:37:23,236 --> 00:37:35,222
and need to participate by Zoom can, and people who participate better in other formats can, and people who get digital news versus mail versus seeing flyers, that's something we need to invest in.

394
00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:39,464
That funding is not currently being approved.

395
00:37:40,685 --> 00:37:41,706
I want to do this right.

396
00:37:42,086 --> 00:37:43,947
I think we've put in a lot of effort.

397
00:37:45,688 --> 00:37:52,171
I think we still have a long way to go, but we actually have gotten a lot of broad strokes and details

398
00:37:52,624 --> 00:37:55,406
that should be modified and amended and edited.

399
00:37:55,426 --> 00:38:02,790
I don't know what starting from scratch would look like, especially without any professional support.

400
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:22,183
And yeah, I think that's kind of my main thoughts of, I do have many detailed thoughts, but it almost doesn't feel useful to go into those details in this particular moment.

401
00:38:23,565 --> 00:38:38,354
So imagine this is like, I get what you're saying in terms of now, if we don't know where it's going, or what's going to be done with this information, why would we share it?

402
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:43,777
I would argue that that's the exact reason why we want to kind of capture it right now.

403
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:45,158
Because if

404
00:38:48,689 --> 00:38:54,190
if we don't capture it, I feel like a lot of the work that we've done has kind of been for naught.

405
00:38:55,070 --> 00:39:00,412
And this might just be me selfish, you know, last meeting as chair, last meeting as a member.

406
00:39:01,492 --> 00:39:14,835
But I think if we can have some really specific feedback, plus this general guidance, then that's doing this board, the staff, the public, a service.

407
00:39:15,942 --> 00:39:18,403
So if you do have specific feedback, I'd love to hear it.

408
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:19,703
I'm taking notes.

409
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:21,664
I pulled in those addresses.

410
00:39:21,744 --> 00:39:23,404
John, I pulled in the addresses you sent.

411
00:39:24,044 --> 00:39:28,045
And then I can share screen to kind of pull everything together.

412
00:39:29,406 --> 00:39:33,387
Yeah, in that case, I'll probably email my kind of some more.

413
00:39:33,427 --> 00:39:40,589
But the broad picture or the main points that I do want to share into the next draft are I

414
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:51,009
Around kind of the borders of the corridors, I actually agree with a lot of the addresses that Ben has shared with Medford, the corridors.

415
00:39:51,710 --> 00:40:02,202
Well, so I'm more familiar with Medford square, but I was talking with someone yesterday and it is true that in some of the corridors, we're kind of going out.

416
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:19,311
more or kind of a larger number of buildings and I and we've have gotten a decent amount of kind of feedback on those specific ones and I'd love for us to go through them kind of a second time or fifth time or I'm sure we've gone through it multiple times.

417
00:40:20,091 --> 00:40:29,453
I do agree with the kind of details of the Medford square one and think that we should do that amount of diligence on the exact boundaries of the other squares and corridors.

418
00:40:29,473 --> 00:40:30,674
The other

419
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:40,857
thing is I also kind of in many ways agreeing with some earlier comments there.

420
00:40:41,697 --> 00:41:01,248
The big risk with not moving right now is that there is development happening that follows the current zoning and the current zoning is in some ways very restrictive in residential areas and in some of these other commercial areas extremely permissive and allows for things that

421
00:41:02,278 --> 00:41:14,088
As far as I can tell, no single person in the city actually wants, I shouldn't actually say that, but for example, more banks, a third car wash in a two block radius.

422
00:41:15,229 --> 00:41:25,698
Maybe there's an individual, I apologize, but I do think that there is an urgency to at least stop the things that there is a consensus that that is not the future.

423
00:41:26,499 --> 00:41:30,442
Create flexibility as we figure out what

424
00:41:30,901 --> 00:41:36,505
of a range of remaining options we want and doing a kind of staged approach.

425
00:41:37,266 --> 00:41:43,631
I know that it is difficult if not to get consensus, but I do think there are some changes that we have consensus on.

426
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:48,054
We want a more walkable and person-centric city.

427
00:41:48,754 --> 00:41:56,940
We want commercial corridors to be able to grow in reasonable ways.

428
00:41:58,261 --> 00:42:00,063
And I think that staging it

429
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:05,173
In kind of closing off some options and then doing a second round of.

430
00:42:06,453 --> 00:42:13,536
Detail could work, and I think that actually is compatible with the summaries I've read of yesterday's meeting.

431
00:42:13,556 --> 00:42:18,659
I could not stay up till 2 am so I've nor have I had time with work to watch it.

432
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:22,620
But from the summaries, this seems compatible with some of the proposed timelines.

433
00:42:24,681 --> 00:42:28,163
So what you're saying is like, let's prioritize some of the.

434
00:42:29,188 --> 00:42:33,331
let's prioritize the quarters, the squares, maybe some of the smaller bits.

435
00:42:34,693 --> 00:42:42,899
And I'm using smaller, just like geographically, not saying their impact on Medford or, you know, the citizens that live there is less than others.

436
00:42:46,082 --> 00:42:49,705
Yes, certainly in terms of the geography, focusing on those.

437
00:42:49,925 --> 00:42:55,850
And then I think also in terms of what elements of the zoning, I think there is value in considering

438
00:42:56,673 --> 00:42:59,034
intentionally zoning things twice.

439
00:42:59,935 --> 00:43:02,776
And I'm so open to feedback that that is a nightmare.

440
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:06,938
But I do think that same kind of... Can you tell me more about that concept?

441
00:43:08,999 --> 00:43:11,640
I think it's not dissimilar to what we tried to do

442
00:43:12,152 --> 00:43:22,554
where there was that initial round of fixing definitions and typos and things, and getting things into alignment with very basic definitions.

443
00:43:22,614 --> 00:43:34,277
I think there is a next level of minimally controversial changes that prevent, for example, a 15-story car.

444
00:43:35,677 --> 00:43:37,358
I'm trying to think of an example.

445
00:43:37,378 --> 00:43:37,898
15-story bank.

446
00:43:39,698 --> 00:43:46,720
I'm trying to find an example that I think would be universally or broadly unexciting.

447
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:53,481
And kind of things that there is a consensus around in the city.

448
00:43:53,501 --> 00:43:58,602
And then I think there is a broad range of options of what our ideal future could be like.

449
00:43:58,622 --> 00:44:08,344
And I think the answer to that is there are people who have different visions of different futures that are within the realm of reasonable people can disagree, and I think we should

450
00:44:08,865 --> 00:44:21,139
have the space to be able to find compromise while making sure that while we argue about the best path forward, we don't end up with the thing that actually none of us want.

451
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:28,146
And so a staggered approach, which is, again, what we have started doing, but maybe adding a few more stages.

452
00:44:28,186 --> 00:44:30,349
I think that also has the benefit of providing

453
00:44:32,004 --> 00:44:49,459
more opportunity to get detailed and more opportunity for the public to provide feedback and not feel rushed and all or nothing because all public policy, I'm a big iterative person for public policy.

454
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:50,420
Yeah.

455
00:44:52,062 --> 00:44:53,363
And that also lets us when we

456
00:44:54,162 --> 00:44:54,802
We are human.

457
00:44:55,363 --> 00:44:56,764
Every group of humans is human.

458
00:44:57,224 --> 00:44:58,365
Something will get messed up.

459
00:44:58,865 --> 00:45:05,630
That makes it possible, and not just possible, but likely to be able to fix it in a reasonable time scope.

460
00:45:06,151 --> 00:45:09,073
So that's my advocacy at this moment.

461
00:45:10,013 --> 00:45:12,895
Yeah, we're all humans at this point, I think.

462
00:45:14,597 --> 00:45:15,297
As far as I can tell.

463
00:45:15,737 --> 00:45:16,578
As far as I can tell.

464
00:45:16,598 --> 00:45:17,659
OK.

465
00:45:23,963 --> 00:45:24,683
Thank you, Ari.

466
00:45:26,704 --> 00:45:27,624
I took some notes.

467
00:45:28,084 --> 00:45:28,464
Dina.

468
00:45:28,484 --> 00:45:29,724
Yeah.

469
00:45:30,484 --> 00:45:31,164
New to the group.

470
00:45:32,005 --> 00:45:36,605
So I will give some comments just coming, looking into the process.

471
00:45:36,845 --> 00:45:42,226
And one of the things I'm just struck by, it seems to me it's everything all at once.

472
00:45:43,647 --> 00:45:45,927
And I heard the word iterative mentioned.

473
00:45:46,107 --> 00:45:47,787
And I think that's really important here.

474
00:45:49,008 --> 00:45:50,028
I think that

475
00:45:51,597 --> 00:45:52,978
The parcel should be broken out.

476
00:45:53,498 --> 00:45:59,362
I don't understand why West Method is bunched in with Method Square.

477
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:01,683
I think they should be separate.

478
00:46:02,604 --> 00:46:06,166
I think Method Square should be the focus right now.

479
00:46:07,247 --> 00:46:20,995
And looking at the zoning of the changes that are needed in that area that are completely overdue, I remember as a child and early in my teens, a very vibrant Method Square

480
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:22,725
prior to the ring road.

481
00:46:23,805 --> 00:46:26,346
And I think those things should be looked at.

482
00:46:26,426 --> 00:46:39,608
And again, addressing the boundaries of the height of the buildings towards the residential areas of what those will look like in relationship to the houses behind those different areas.

483
00:46:40,968 --> 00:46:50,170
I think it's important to iterate because when you do a good job in one area and that good job needs to include DPW,

484
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:58,929
fire, police, schools, and it also needs to include traffic studies, right?

485
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,570
Parking as well.

486
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:08,974
Those are things that all go into each particular project in part of the zoning, and they cannot be separated.

487
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:10,095
They're one.

488
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:26,391
And I think it's also very important as we look at each one of these different zoning pieces that are in front of us, that the message to the public is clear, what the zoning looks like now and what it will be.

489
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:40,262
And I think one of the most important concepts and what I started to do since being appointed to the board is walking around, looking at the maps, looking where the boundaries are,

490
00:47:41,025 --> 00:48:05,139
looking at what those changes would be and allowing our residents to also have that same opportunity to look and gather information and provide constructive public comment so we can collaborate as a group with the public and we can come up with good recommendations.

491
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,922
And hopefully we're able to do that in a very

492
00:48:11,343 --> 00:48:19,105
thoughtful way, rather than everything all at once, because it is way too much right now.

493
00:48:19,765 --> 00:48:24,646
The information is complicated at times to digest, and at times isn't clear.

494
00:48:24,987 --> 00:48:33,889
And we want to make sure the information is clear, so that we are able to make the best decision going forward.

495
00:48:35,848 --> 00:48:36,688
That's what I got for now.

496
00:48:36,728 --> 00:48:40,229
Do you have any specific feedback that we should incorporate?

497
00:48:40,249 --> 00:48:47,510
I would definitely incorporate West Mefford out from Mefford Square.

498
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:56,552
Mefford Square has been overdue for years and years and years and needs to be done with the ring road, whatever.

499
00:48:56,612 --> 00:49:02,133
But we need to certainly take a good look at that and do that.

500
00:49:02,193 --> 00:49:05,534
I mean, Mefford Square has fallen behind

501
00:49:06,351 --> 00:49:10,274
in comparison to some of the other surrounding cities that we have.

502
00:49:10,855 --> 00:49:25,308
And I remember at one of the sessions that I attended, Ben gave a very good comment that I would like to echo again, which is, what's in it for the residents of Medford?

503
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:45,308
And I think by doing and revitalizing Method Square and looking at the zoning that's needed there and doing it in a thoughtful way that incorporates all the pieces as part of that zoning, we can certainly assure the citizens of Medford what is in it for them.

504
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,189
Thank you, that's really helpful.

505
00:49:56,209 --> 00:50:06,956
I'm trying to make sure I'm capturing everything.

506
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:49,829
Okay, so let me summarize what I've heard from the board as well as add some of my own input.

507
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:58,579
So I'm going to start with ADUs because

508
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:08,178
We, I haven't heard a lot of feedback from the board on those, but I did have some specific feedback that I wanted to pass on to the consultant.

509
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:16,503
And again, all of this is in reflection that, you know, I'm not gonna be a member of the board moving forward.

510
00:51:17,204 --> 00:51:24,608
So, you know, I'm kind of leaving it to the board, to the public to do what they want with this information.

511
00:51:24,768 --> 00:51:27,790
So for ADUs, I'd say that this is an issue that,

512
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,461
we should, as a city, should prioritize.

513
00:51:30,481 --> 00:51:41,345
I think going with the state guidance for the state requirement of one ADU by right is, no pun intended, the right thing to do.

514
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:48,427
And I think that any additional ADUs, whether it's one or two, depending on the zone, would all be by special permit.

515
00:51:50,363 --> 00:51:53,864
Because I believe we have some zones where you can have 2 by right.

516
00:51:54,524 --> 00:52:01,286
And then 1 additional, I would say it's 1 by right and then the 2 would be by special permit.

517
00:52:01,306 --> 00:52:06,187
I don't know if anybody has any.

518
00:52:09,388 --> 00:52:10,068
Thoughts on that Ben.

519
00:52:11,267 --> 00:52:13,548
I'll just chime in to say I completely agree with that.

520
00:52:14,228 --> 00:52:14,649
Okay.

521
00:52:15,169 --> 00:52:20,371
It's not, it's not crazy to think that we can handle additional ADUs by special permit.

522
00:52:21,072 --> 00:52:21,152
Yeah.

523
00:52:21,292 --> 00:52:23,233
And it just keeps things so much simpler.

524
00:52:23,853 --> 00:52:24,113
Yes.

525
00:52:24,653 --> 00:52:31,797
And, you know, as, as Ari alluded to, if we get this wrong, we can go back and modify it, but it's, it's incremental.

526
00:52:31,817 --> 00:52:32,737
It's iterative change.

527
00:52:33,918 --> 00:52:34,478
Um, for,

528
00:52:37,222 --> 00:52:39,585
And after this, I'd encourage discussion for all of us.

529
00:52:40,106 --> 00:52:43,690
John, I saw you just came off a mute.

530
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:49,336
Yeah, would it be appropriate for me to mention a couple of things we could use professional guidance on?

531
00:52:50,317 --> 00:52:51,699
Yeah.

532
00:52:52,227 --> 00:53:02,335
Yeah, I'll add it to my, I've categorized things, ADUs, Medford Square, West Medford Square, general residential, corridors, and then general requests, which is a lot of process stuff.

533
00:53:02,996 --> 00:53:07,860
This sort of connects with ADUs, but other aspects as well.

534
00:53:09,081 --> 00:53:18,289
How we can use site plan review and design review potentially to influence the kind of outcomes we would like to see.

535
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:44,669
Also specifically with ADUs, I looked at the state law and it only requires that single family neighborhoods get one ADU by right, which I found very interesting because people have talked about, well, maybe there could be a three family building and each of the three family units has an ADU.

536
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:46,290
I guess the state's thinking was,

537
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:57,845
that if you're a single family house in an area that's zoned two or three family, you have other ways of increasing the density in your building without an ADU.

538
00:53:59,646 --> 00:54:01,006
So that's something to think about.

539
00:54:02,487 --> 00:54:08,509
And also the general issue of what happens during this period when we're in limbo.

540
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:13,992
The state has passed this law, but we haven't done anything in Medford about it, correct?

541
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:16,884
We want to chime in.

542
00:54:17,164 --> 00:54:18,365
Yeah, do you mind Daniel?

543
00:54:19,105 --> 00:54:21,507
So, you might be able to offer some clarity.

544
00:54:21,527 --> 00:54:25,070
Yeah, so the, the state law supersedes.

545
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:30,473
Our local zoning, which basically says that our zoning is not enforceable.

546
00:54:30,914 --> 00:54:35,657
So, the fact that we have not updated our ordinance to comply.

547
00:54:38,502 --> 00:54:45,447
It's irrelevant that people can build 80s now, and it's the way the law was written.

548
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:48,530
It was that these they're called protected use.

549
00:54:48,590 --> 00:55:05,063
So, any zoning district that allows single family homes, either by right or by special permit, any of those any residential structure, regardless of how many units it has is entitled to 1 protected use.

550
00:55:05,403 --> 00:55:07,905
So you could have a 9 unit building.

551
00:55:08,987 --> 00:55:24,992
and have a 10th unit as an ADU by right if it's no larger than 900 square feet or in half the size of the actual structure.

552
00:55:25,684 --> 00:55:28,546
So I have a lot of issues with how the state law was written.

553
00:55:28,586 --> 00:55:36,532
I think it's very clunky and they clearly didn't have any planners that were chiming in on how they wrote that.

554
00:55:36,912 --> 00:55:49,661
So that is why some of the zoning districts didn't allow single families when we were doing like the, you are zoning because the 9,

555
00:55:53,537 --> 00:56:00,141
The 9 unit building loophole to get the 10th unit and it wouldn't have to be affordable.

556
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:07,265
So this is how do you basically the state law is really butts up against and makes us.

557
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:11,728
Makes our zoning updates difficult.

558
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:12,849
It is a headache.

559
00:56:17,437 --> 00:56:25,043
And so the only, right now for the setbacks, we can't regulate the setbacks that are any more strict than for accessory structures.

560
00:56:25,443 --> 00:56:32,669
So if garages are allowed to be five feet from the lot line, then a detached ADU can also be five feet from the lot line.

561
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:38,774
And we also can't regulate height to be more restrictive than the primary dwelling.

562
00:56:39,175 --> 00:56:47,041
So if the maximum height for the principal dwelling unit

563
00:56:47,953 --> 00:56:51,837
Is 60 feet just throwing out something ridiculous.

564
00:56:52,178 --> 00:56:53,920
Then the 80, you can also be 60 feet.

565
00:56:54,801 --> 00:56:59,586
It's, it's, it's not a really great law.

566
00:57:00,507 --> 00:57:06,514
So, we're here are basically the only things that we can really regulate are.

567
00:57:08,885 --> 00:57:21,970
The choice of whether we want to allow a 2nd, 80, you and oddly enough, the legislature was very prescriptive and requires a special permit for a 2nd, 80, you very, very bizarre.

568
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:25,671
So, so we can actually do 2 ideas by right.

569
00:57:25,851 --> 00:57:29,352
The 2nd, 1 has to be by special permit for protected use.

570
00:57:29,372 --> 00:57:29,452
So.

571
00:57:32,814 --> 00:57:41,300
That's why the residential zoning district, it's really hard to do 80 use without looking at the separate from.

572
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,762
The residential zones, because they're so intertwined.

573
00:57:45,163 --> 00:57:47,024
Basically, if you look at the zoning map and.

574
00:57:48,305 --> 00:57:53,729
And you just have to add plus 1 for that number of units that are allowed.

575
00:57:54,389 --> 00:57:57,251
So, it's, it's been, it's challenging.

576
00:57:57,271 --> 00:57:58,032
Yeah.

577
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:10,244
So, our hands are really tied with what we can do with those, but I think design guidelines or design standards, which would be have more teeth would be really, really important.

578
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:14,365
Especially around, like, historic conversions.

579
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:20,187
We, we really need to have those really ironed out before.

580
00:58:20,207 --> 00:58:23,409
You know, we allow historic convergence.

581
00:58:23,649 --> 00:58:26,450
We don't have the standards that are really solid.

582
00:58:29,457 --> 00:58:35,602
Which, thankfully, things are slowing down that we can actually take the time to work in these chunks.

583
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:47,612
And we don't have a large planning staff, so we would normally be able to, because I do have the expertise to do the work that the consultants are doing, but I just have so many other tasks.

584
00:58:47,932 --> 00:58:51,055
So that's why you farm out these standalone projects.

585
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:57,420
But if things are spread out more, we can spend more time to do it right.

586
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:04,093
I'm rambling a little bit because I'm still I'm still very sleep deprived from last night.

587
00:59:04,393 --> 00:59:05,954
So I probably should not talk too much.

588
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,156
But thank you so much.

589
00:59:08,216 --> 00:59:09,256
That's been very helpful.

590
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:14,660
Thank you, Daniel.

591
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:17,182
Oh, one other thing, if I may.

592
00:59:17,202 --> 00:59:18,243
Yeah.

593
00:59:19,984 --> 00:59:26,348
In my attempts to educate myself, I've run across various articles and online

594
00:59:28,138 --> 00:59:31,679
which I think members of the board would be very interested in reading.

595
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:37,822
But I'm not sure if there's any legal way to do that in the context of the open meeting law.

596
00:59:38,562 --> 00:59:41,443
Is it possible to have perhaps?

597
00:59:41,864 --> 00:59:42,624
I'm sorry, go ahead.

598
00:59:42,984 --> 00:59:46,766
I would say you can drop the links to those in the chat for this meeting.

599
00:59:48,206 --> 00:59:52,188
You could also send them to Danielle, Alicia, Christian,

600
00:59:53,073 --> 01:00:07,865
Um, you know, other members of city staff and they could disseminate them to the board, but I would say, you know, if there's articles that are informative on zoning on planning development and so on, drop them in the chat.

601
01:00:07,885 --> 01:00:14,030
Um, and then even the public that's part of these meetings can check out those, those articles as well.

602
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:15,271
Okay.

603
01:00:15,611 --> 01:00:16,011
Thank you.

604
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:17,593
Yeah, but I think that's great.

605
01:00:17,713 --> 01:00:20,395
And I would encourage other members of the board to do the same.

606
01:00:21,908 --> 01:00:26,030
It might be useful if there were a particular place the public could go.

607
01:00:26,411 --> 01:00:42,260
If this idea caught on and there were 10 or 20 articles of general interest, it might be useful for the public if they had a place they could go to, not to see specific comments from folks in Medford, but just what the rest of the world is saying.

608
01:00:43,761 --> 01:00:44,001
Yeah.

609
01:00:44,802 --> 01:00:50,025
I hesitate to add more to City Staff's plate, but maybe there's an easy way to add

610
01:00:51,425 --> 01:00:52,786
some sort of tracker for that.

611
01:00:53,026 --> 01:00:53,947
But yeah, that's interesting.

612
01:00:54,447 --> 01:00:54,848
Thank you.

613
01:00:55,608 --> 01:00:55,808
Yeah.

614
01:00:56,909 --> 01:00:57,149
OK.

615
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:02,713
So in terms of ADUs, I think we can keep going on that one.

616
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:07,197
Prioritize one by right per the state.

617
01:01:07,957 --> 01:01:10,099
No movement there.

618
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:13,341
And then no additional ADU by right.

619
01:01:13,361 --> 01:01:18,945
And any additional, whether it's one or two, depending on the zone, would all be by special permit.

620
01:01:20,887 --> 01:01:21,027
Cool.

621
01:01:22,623 --> 01:01:29,249
And again, just a recommendation, you know, well, you guys can kind of rip it up when I'm on the other side.

622
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:32,873
And then I'll take my two minutes to let you know what I really think.

623
01:01:33,914 --> 01:01:34,675
Medford Square.

624
01:01:34,695 --> 01:01:38,939
Actually, let me do West Medford Square first.

625
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:44,765
So for West Medford Square, what I'm hearing is continue to prioritize it.

626
01:01:46,277 --> 01:01:48,799
And these three things might sound conflicting.

627
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:56,365
Continue to prioritize, sever from Medford Square, and I know that's a city council thing, that's not a consultant thing.

628
01:01:57,426 --> 01:02:04,331
And then also kind of keep it on hold until the completion of this economic development plan that's in the works.

629
01:02:06,273 --> 01:02:11,877
So some of those things our consultant can do, some of them they can't, but they're all there.

630
01:02:12,827 --> 01:02:18,996
I also, I added the addresses that john had sent over, I'm just going to read those out kind of for the record.

631
01:02:19,016 --> 01:02:23,903
And john your comment on these, and feel free to jump in.

632
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:29,344
But your comment, I'm just going to read the email.

633
01:02:29,864 --> 01:02:35,691
Last time we discussed the squares, we talked about trimming residential housing from the proposed mixed use zones.

634
01:02:36,312 --> 01:02:40,737
The consensus seemed to be that putting them with residential zones would simplify our discussion of the squares.

635
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:42,198
It was pointed out.

636
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:45,122
And I believe the commenter is on the call this evening.

637
01:02:45,967 --> 01:02:51,808
that there was a very nice two-family house built in 1880, almost certainly the single family, at 51 Harvard Ave.

638
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:52,929
that would become mixed-use.

639
01:02:54,369 --> 01:02:58,970
Other board members suggested that there were most probably similar homes in the proposed mixed-use districts.

640
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:12,313
John valiantly volunteered to research West Bedford Square and said that the addresses below all appear to be one or two family houses within the trimmed UR districts.

641
01:03:14,577 --> 01:03:28,901
Similar to what Ben said about the Medford Square properties, these might not fit the exclusion qualities that we're looking at, but they should just be revisited.

642
01:03:28,921 --> 01:03:31,342
On Canal Street, it's 21, 24, 25, 26, 30, and 34.

643
01:03:31,422 --> 01:03:32,502
Prescott Street, 5, 9, 10, and 27.

644
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,141
Irving Street, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, and 17.

645
01:03:47,722 --> 01:03:48,523
On High Street, 414, 417, 418, 437, 511.

646
01:03:50,004 --> 01:03:53,246
On Johnson Avenue, 3, Harvard Avenue, 43, 47, 51, Boston Avenue,

647
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:18,331
24, 28, 30, on Warren Street, 7, 9, 10.

648
01:04:19,492 --> 01:04:26,034
With an additional note that there's also apartment buildings and buildings used by St.

649
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:28,195
Raphael's Church that are not in the list above.

650
01:04:30,515 --> 01:04:31,496
John, do you have anything to add?

651
01:04:34,517 --> 01:04:38,578
I want to thank you for doing that work, that on-the-ground work is just invaluable.

652
01:04:39,858 --> 01:04:41,199
I'll get to that in a second.

653
01:04:43,788 --> 01:04:55,732
I also want to pass on the guidance to the consultant that we want, I mean, ideally we'd have on the ground, you know, people pounding the pavement every block, every parcel, every inch of this city.

654
01:04:56,192 --> 01:05:09,857
But I think maybe a reasonable ask, given that we don't even know if we have any resources moving forward, is that we would like on the ground footwork for at least two blocks of district edges.

655
01:05:12,168 --> 01:05:21,336
I don't know, I threw out two blocks because one felt not big enough and I feel like these districts are small enough that three might transect the whole district.

656
01:05:22,857 --> 01:05:23,798
That sounds reasonable to me.

657
01:05:24,598 --> 01:05:25,479
But just some guidance.

658
01:05:25,859 --> 01:05:26,400
Agreed.

659
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,482
Okay, great.

660
01:05:32,105 --> 01:05:32,405
Dina?

661
01:05:33,165 --> 01:05:35,668
No, I said that sounds like a good plan, walking around.

662
01:05:35,888 --> 01:05:36,668
What does it look like?

663
01:05:37,249 --> 01:05:39,250
Yes, and to kind of

664
01:05:40,423 --> 01:05:45,145
Go back to what Ari said, this doesn't say who's going to do it, but just as it means to be done.

665
01:05:46,286 --> 01:05:48,827
So we're kind of getting to, you know, fun territory there.

666
01:05:50,388 --> 01:05:59,813
Okay, so Medford Square, prioritize, sever from West Medford Square, and again, that's a city council action, that would not be Innocent Associates, that would not be us, that would not be the mayor.

667
01:06:01,014 --> 01:06:01,314
And then,

668
01:06:02,513 --> 01:06:17,625
also on the ground footwork for at least two blocks of district edges, and then per Ben, the addresses that he highlighted, 7 Hillside, 17 Garden Street, 11 Garden Street, 10 Porter Road, 14 to 16 Porter, 19 Governors Road.

669
01:06:21,448 --> 01:06:28,574
And then for general residential, which I feel like is the biggest

670
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:31,913
monster in front of us here.

671
01:06:31,933 --> 01:06:37,054
I would almost suggest like a wholesale relaunch of that entire initiative.

672
01:06:37,074 --> 01:06:38,915
I completely agree.

673
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:46,696
Yeah, which feels like a really big ask of the city of any consultant that would come before us.

674
01:06:48,476 --> 01:06:52,857
But I would say public engagement is going to be number one there.

675
01:06:53,417 --> 01:06:56,678
And whatever consultant we engage with, and I'm

676
01:06:57,235 --> 01:06:59,836
I really enjoy the work that we've done with Emily and Paula.

677
01:06:59,896 --> 01:07:02,637
So this is by no means saying that we're not going to work with them.

678
01:07:03,097 --> 01:07:12,060
But I would say whatever, whatever contract we engage with, should include, you know, workshops to educate and engage the public.

679
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:26,344
Two specific examples, you know, maybe we royally set up a table at Wellington, or the West for Medford Square Commuter Rail, or you know, all all stops in Medford.

680
01:07:28,174 --> 01:07:30,584
just to help educate people of the process that's going on.

681
01:07:32,605 --> 01:07:38,447
drawing some of the kind of silent participants that Adam kind of alluded to.

682
01:07:38,467 --> 01:07:42,808
I'm thinking of myself as a working renter.

683
01:07:42,828 --> 01:07:46,229
I didn't hear from a lot of renters in the public outreach.

684
01:07:46,449 --> 01:07:57,371
And I'm very curious kind of what that population thinks of these proposals, especially if they're like me, and they would love to make their full time permanent home in Medford.

685
01:07:57,831 --> 01:07:59,452
So I think that's a potential way of

686
01:08:00,907 --> 01:08:07,972
getting some outreach, as well as maybe there's a meetup at one of the projects we saw before us, the Great American Beer Hall.

687
01:08:08,492 --> 01:08:09,593
I was there last Thursday.

688
01:08:09,613 --> 01:08:11,274
I had a great time.

689
01:08:11,694 --> 01:08:13,195
It's such an electric venue.

690
01:08:14,336 --> 01:08:15,917
There's a lot of local people there.

691
01:08:15,937 --> 01:08:28,685
And I think that that would be a really great spot to partner with the local business and then also, you know, do some more outreach outside of kind of public meetings and so on.

692
01:08:28,805 --> 01:08:29,526
Ben, I see your hand.

693
01:08:30,905 --> 01:08:39,331
Yeah, I just want to, um, uh, plus one, the, the, we didn't hear from a lot of renters as part of the public comment period.

694
01:08:39,351 --> 01:08:44,074
And I think that that's a critical constituent group, critical group of residents.

695
01:08:44,554 --> 01:08:47,616
Um, I would also add non-native English speakers.

696
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:54,441
And I realized that there's time and resources for translation services and deliberate outreach, but we have.

697
01:08:55,178 --> 01:09:00,262
a very vibrant non-native English speaker community in this city.

698
01:09:00,643 --> 01:09:05,487
And I don't think that they've had much of a chance to participate.

699
01:09:05,527 --> 01:09:09,210
And I would welcome efforts to increase that participation.

700
01:09:10,491 --> 01:09:13,594
Yeah, I'm grabbing my copy of the comprehensive plan.

701
01:09:14,615 --> 01:09:22,461
And there's a great list of the project team, the steering committee,

702
01:09:24,346 --> 01:09:32,590
City staff boards and commissions, and it has a lot of different groups that could be called on to help reach those populations.

703
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:37,653
Yeah, so I like that, and that's a good shout.

704
01:09:38,393 --> 01:09:51,960
We have not heard a lot of non-Native, I don't think we've heard a single non-English comment, or I haven't read one now that I think about it, which is really a shame.

705
01:09:54,005 --> 01:10:00,027
from people whose English is clearly accented with another language they know.

706
01:10:00,967 --> 01:10:04,248
So I would say there are many multilingual people in the city.

707
01:10:04,748 --> 01:10:05,528
Sure, sure.

708
01:10:05,588 --> 01:10:07,789
But somebody that might not speak English.

709
01:10:08,469 --> 01:10:09,009
Absolutely.

710
01:10:09,049 --> 01:10:15,611
And I very strongly agree with intentional outreach to both those populations and to renters.

711
01:10:16,311 --> 01:10:16,571
Yeah.

712
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:22,753
So I think we should prepare our consultant to do that sort of work.

713
01:10:28,588 --> 01:10:29,768
And then.

714
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:36,351
Yeah, if that process is going to be wholesale restarted.

715
01:10:36,371 --> 01:10:41,533
I, I honestly don't have a ton of specific comments, but the amount of.

716
01:10:44,075 --> 01:10:54,179
What's it called the amount of I'm just going to say feedback because it's a more neutral word, but the amount of feedback that we got from residents.

717
01:10:55,833 --> 01:11:00,016
that they didn't want what was being proposed to happen to their neighborhood.

718
01:11:00,036 --> 01:11:04,099
I don't even want to talk about what was being proposed to happen to their neighborhood.

719
01:11:04,119 --> 01:11:16,549
I think there does need to be an increase in density in Medford, but I think the way it was done was almost like a patriarchal

720
01:11:17,918 --> 01:11:20,980
a way of saying this will happen to your neighborhood.

721
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,662
I think we just need to flip that script.

722
01:11:23,742 --> 01:11:27,724
We need to bring people along, whether it's education or workshops.

723
01:11:28,725 --> 01:11:29,605
Dina, I see your hand.

724
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:34,568
Yes.

725
01:11:34,588 --> 01:11:38,631
I would certainly delay residential zoning.

726
01:11:38,651 --> 01:11:42,353
And I think you go back to the whole point about being iterative again.

727
01:11:42,513 --> 01:11:43,874
You show success.

728
01:11:44,354 --> 01:11:46,676
You work on the projects in front of you.

729
01:11:47,266 --> 01:11:59,273
You show success, you show collaboration with the citizens, and you show what can be done with Medford to benefit the citizens in collaboration with all the different pieces of infrastructure that need to support it.

730
01:12:00,134 --> 01:12:05,337
And then once you develop that, the final piece would be the residential piece.

731
01:12:05,777 --> 01:12:06,998
If needed, right?

732
01:12:07,138 --> 01:12:07,658
If needed.

733
01:12:07,678 --> 01:12:09,339
I think it'll be needed.

734
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,220
I think you'll need it.

735
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,321
Yeah, I think you'll need it.

736
01:12:11,381 --> 01:12:22,108
But at that point, you've already developed a process that works and something that can be implemented and certainly show success because we learn as we do.

737
01:12:22,128 --> 01:12:26,091
When we do something, we go back and figure out what went wrong.

738
01:12:26,191 --> 01:12:29,193
And then we try to fix those pieces going forward.

739
01:12:29,233 --> 01:12:33,676
And I think that will be certainly a recipe for success.

740
01:12:34,138 --> 01:12:35,560
with the changes for zoning.

741
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,961
And I think it's also important.

742
01:12:37,341 --> 01:12:54,700
I read the comprehensive plan, and I think it's important that going forward, we link a lot of the elements, yeah, a lot of the elements that we do back to the comprehensive plan, which was a great document that was developed by so many people and residents in Medford.

743
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:56,062
So kudos to that group.

744
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,501
Yeah, we had a lot of work put into the comprehensive plan.

745
01:13:00,201 --> 01:13:06,243
So much so that, you know, when members of the public made comments about, oh, you know, we weren't engaged for this.

746
01:13:06,263 --> 01:13:14,486
I found some people whose names were mentioned in the comprehensive plan who said that they were involved in it.

747
01:13:14,626 --> 01:13:18,947
So I'd encourage everyone to maybe do a little refresh of that on their own.

748
01:13:18,967 --> 01:13:20,728
You know, the board can't,

749
01:13:22,255 --> 01:13:24,096
can't kind of, can't do everything.

750
01:13:24,116 --> 01:13:32,621
So, you know, maybe a quick refresh of that would be helpful for members of the public that are engaged in this process.

751
01:13:32,761 --> 01:13:38,364
It shows the foundation for the need, and that's an important document.

752
01:13:39,504 --> 01:13:39,804
Ari?

753
01:13:42,646 --> 01:13:48,529
I did want to make a kind of brief note about kind of the

754
01:13:49,315 --> 01:13:53,960
groups we just talked about that haven't provided a lot of feedback and about restarting.

755
01:13:53,980 --> 01:14:02,027
I do want to kind of re-emphasize that I think it is important to get some things done that are almost ready to be done quickly.

756
01:14:02,047 --> 01:14:05,090
I don't disagree about the kind of big residential.

757
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:09,614
I think that should be last and I'm open to restarting it because it clearly didn't go well.

758
01:14:12,157 --> 01:14:12,777
There's been a

759
01:14:14,017 --> 01:14:27,889
substantial theme of rhetoric around like real Medford and whose voice counts and I do want to just explicitly call out that I have heard that and I am not entertained.

760
01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:31,612
If you live in Medford, you're real Medford.

761
01:14:32,573 --> 01:14:36,896
All of us with all our different backgrounds and experiences are real Medford and

762
01:14:38,772 --> 01:14:43,997
we have to engage that, and there is no one correct vision that we know.

763
01:14:45,919 --> 01:14:46,700
Well said, Ari.

764
01:14:46,720 --> 01:15:00,754
Yeah, I do have a lot of, I don't know what the right word is, but when people would come up before us and say, I've lived in Medford for X number of years,

765
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:03,771
know that that's great.

766
01:15:04,171 --> 01:15:07,354
You got into a wonderful city at a wonderful time.

767
01:15:07,915 --> 01:15:11,398
It's still a wonderful city, and we want to make it a wonderful time to get in again.

768
01:15:12,039 --> 01:15:16,343
So you know, as a renter, you know, I'd love to be part of that.

769
01:15:16,403 --> 01:15:20,607
But I also recognize, you know, there's a lot of

770
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:23,665
A lot of stuff at play.

771
01:15:23,945 --> 01:15:30,210
And I would hope, as a city, we move more towards inclusiveness and belonging and collaboration.

772
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:33,773
This is not an us versus them problem.

773
01:15:34,514 --> 01:15:37,036
This is a all together problem.

774
01:15:38,277 --> 01:15:39,978
But yeah, that's a good reminder, Ari.

775
01:15:41,179 --> 01:15:41,439
Ben?

776
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:46,984
You're on mute still.

777
01:15:48,818 --> 01:15:50,840
lowered my hand and thought that unmuted me, sorry.

778
01:15:52,041 --> 01:15:58,426
This is one more bit of specific feedback on Neighborhood Residential for if and when it gets rebooted.

779
01:15:59,347 --> 01:16:11,518
I would encourage the consultant or whoever's on the hook to revisit the NR1 zone, the very large zone in Fulton Heights that was sort of blanket.

780
01:16:12,358 --> 01:16:26,192
And our one, the justification was largely due to the, the number of private roads and small lots, but that's a very it's a, that's sort of a broad categorization of what is a very diverse part of the city.

781
01:16:26,372 --> 01:16:30,036
And so if there is a goal to increase density and.

782
01:16:31,788 --> 01:16:58,670
know up zone certain areas i think that a closer look is needed at the heights neighborhood um not to say that it should or shouldn't be nr1 but you know i think we just sort of it it felt kind of dismissed because of the private road issue and i think that there's more to it than that and it's worthy of another look that's great feedback

783
01:17:00,733 --> 01:17:03,554
Yeah, and I know that private roads present kind of a unique challenge.

784
01:17:06,836 --> 01:17:14,200
And we heard from some members of the public about issues that they're having with their own private roads.

785
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:19,082
And I know that that's kind of outside the scope of the work we're doing here.

786
01:17:19,342 --> 01:17:25,245
But it's an important factor for how we look at this work.

787
01:17:30,226 --> 01:17:33,267
Um, okay.

788
01:17:33,287 --> 01:17:46,390
So, Dina, you said something that I want to kind of noodle on a little bit, um, you said, um, and I'm, I'm probably not quoting it, but like, we want to delay next steps.

789
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:57,633
Um, so if we are going to delay next steps and you know, we, at some point we have to make a motion to when we're going to continue this public hearing for

790
01:17:58,519 --> 01:18:03,606
Each of these specific items, what feels like a reasonable timeline, you know, thinking about.

791
01:18:04,487 --> 01:18:09,755
President bears announcement about, you know, spring 2026, we have uncertain funding.

792
01:18:10,845 --> 01:18:11,966
This is for residential.

793
01:18:13,427 --> 01:18:19,490
It should be at the end of the projects, once the projects are.

794
01:18:19,531 --> 01:18:22,913
Again, it goes back to my statement of everything all at once.

795
01:18:24,314 --> 01:18:26,855
It's not going to be successful with everything all at once.

796
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:29,437
Do the most important first, method square.

797
01:18:30,898 --> 01:18:30,998
OK.

798
01:18:31,318 --> 01:18:35,040
So not delay to a specific time relative.

799
01:18:35,621 --> 01:18:35,861
Yes.

800
01:18:36,781 --> 01:18:37,482
No success.

801
01:18:38,743 --> 01:18:38,963
Yeah.

802
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42,102
What do other members of the board think about that?

803
01:18:42,782 --> 01:18:50,429
I know it makes it very kind of nebulous, which is a type A person I always hate, but we're onto something here.

804
01:18:50,449 --> 01:18:52,330
I think building on success.

805
01:18:53,431 --> 01:18:53,932
Yeah, John.

806
01:18:53,952 --> 01:18:56,013
Yeah, I'm sorry.

807
01:18:56,073 --> 01:18:59,596
I can't find the raise hand icon on my particular Zoom, so.

808
01:18:59,676 --> 01:19:00,257
You're good.

809
01:19:00,317 --> 01:19:00,657
I got you.

810
01:19:00,677 --> 01:19:02,159
That's an old fashioned way.

811
01:19:02,919 --> 01:19:03,660
Analog hand.

812
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:04,421
Yeah, right.

813
01:19:07,265 --> 01:19:20,376
Yeah, it is sort of nebulous, but we're sort of in a gray area here where everything is, well, we're going to get a new chair of the Community Development Board.

814
01:19:20,977 --> 01:19:23,399
We have openings in the Community Development Board.

815
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:28,243
There's no appetite to do residential until 2026.

816
01:19:28,283 --> 01:19:29,644
I think it's okay

817
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:38,942
to for us to slow down our work on the rezoning.

818
01:19:39,002 --> 01:19:49,507
And I understand we may have some site plan review coming up, which is brand new to me and perhaps some of the other board members as well.

819
01:19:50,207 --> 01:19:52,788
So that's another challenge that we have to deal with.

820
01:19:56,390 --> 01:20:02,793
Can I be so bold as to suggest that our next meeting is sometime in September?

821
01:20:04,502 --> 01:20:30,639
I think we have meetings in between then, not necessarily on this topic, but yeah, I think what we'd have to do if the general kind of direction of the board is like, let's delay any next steps until ADU squares, maybe even corridors are substantially complete, you know, we would have to continue the public hearing for general residential, you know, to, it has to be a date certain.

822
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:32,340
So maybe I'm just throwing a date out there.

823
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:33,501
Like maybe it's October,

824
01:20:34,525 --> 01:20:37,628
12th, or I don't even know if that's a Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday.

825
01:20:38,109 --> 01:20:46,937
And then once October 12th comes around, if those, if the other items before us are not substantially complete, then we would vote to continue again.

826
01:20:48,178 --> 01:20:55,546
We have had some feedback from the public that not having like firm dates

827
01:20:56,702 --> 01:21:00,065
isn't helpful because people want to know when things are happening.

828
01:21:00,405 --> 01:21:06,771
But I think if the board consistently communicates, hey, we're not going to start this up until it's substantially complete.

829
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:11,955
And as part of each subsequent meeting, we say, yeah, we think we're 50% there.

830
01:21:12,616 --> 01:21:13,697
We think we're 75.

831
01:21:13,977 --> 01:21:16,139
So people get a general idea of when it's coming.

832
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:18,261
I think that would be a helpful approach.

833
01:21:19,021 --> 01:21:23,625
Now, I don't know if, I think city council maybe

834
01:21:25,122 --> 01:21:29,646
re-referring or the committee maybe re-referring things to us at some point.

835
01:21:30,267 --> 01:21:33,009
So there might be some timelines that start to become out of our control.

836
01:21:33,850 --> 01:21:41,857
But regardless, if things are withdrawn and then resubmitted, they have to go through the CDB process again.

837
01:21:41,937 --> 01:21:46,360
So we get the timeline back within our purview.

838
01:21:49,063 --> 01:21:49,423
Danielle?

839
01:21:53,008 --> 01:22:01,032
Yes, I would recommend to keep your, you want to keep the public hearings open and continue them to a date.

840
01:22:01,912 --> 01:22:02,972
I honestly don't think.

841
01:22:04,173 --> 01:22:07,234
Continuing anything to the 20th will be productive.

842
01:22:07,654 --> 01:22:09,455
There won't be even August.

843
01:22:09,575 --> 01:22:10,676
There'll be nothing new.

844
01:22:10,696 --> 01:22:12,036
There'll be no work have been done.

845
01:22:12,056 --> 01:22:16,839
This is August 20th just August 20th meeting is on the books.

846
01:22:17,339 --> 01:22:19,880
Yeah, but if we don't have anything on it.

847
01:22:20,407 --> 01:22:23,930
then I would cancel the meeting and let you have a nice summer night.

848
01:22:24,671 --> 01:22:29,955
Um, I, things are going to start up in earnest in September.

849
01:22:29,975 --> 01:22:43,587
We have the cappies, um, liquor, which is being, um, there's a residential, um, complex that's they submitted and that's going to go through the site plan review process there.

850
01:22:43,867 --> 01:22:48,351
So there's about a six week lead time and then it'll get to you, you all, um,

851
01:22:49,718 --> 01:22:54,321
but I think just taking a rest and not, yeah.

852
01:22:55,042 --> 01:22:56,563
So maybe September 24th.

853
01:22:56,983 --> 01:23:05,089
And again, this wouldn't be a confirmation that, you know, anything's going to happen, but it would be kind of like a pulse check.

854
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:08,592
Where are we in the process or do we want to push it out further?

855
01:23:08,612 --> 01:23:15,337
I think realistically, if we're talking specifically about the neighborhood residential,

856
01:23:15,857 --> 01:23:27,328
I am it can be much further because that sounds like that would be the next opportunity for us to actually even work on Medford square and the things that we all just agreed.

857
01:23:27,348 --> 01:23:28,109
We want to do 1st.

858
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:31,933
So, I'm going to look at your hand.

859
01:23:32,694 --> 01:23:38,820
Yeah, so we only have the meeting scheduled out to the end of calendar year, but we,

860
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:47,518
If we are maintaining the 1st and 3rd Wednesday schedule, which I know that there was some talk about whether we would depart from that.

861
01:23:48,118 --> 01:23:53,843
But so the latest that you could continue it, I think would be December 17th.

862
01:23:55,785 --> 01:24:00,770
What about the idea that you would have the 2026 calendar and you could continue it to.

863
01:24:02,895 --> 01:24:15,363
You know, a date certain, um, I would hate for us or for you all to continue to a date that you think there would be a meeting as I'm not sure what the, what procedure.

864
01:24:16,664 --> 01:24:25,490
Would have to happen if holiday, like, how, how do you continue or hearing if you can't have the meeting?

865
01:24:25,970 --> 01:24:28,772
So, I would say December 17th and then.

866
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:36,560
It very possible that city council will refer it back to committee for further study, which.

867
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:44,423
Closes the anyways and starts it over again with a clean slate of everyone's eligible.

868
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:46,824
Yeah, they might need that anyways for quorum.

869
01:24:47,764 --> 01:24:49,085
Yeah, so I would say that the.

870
01:24:50,866 --> 01:24:53,087
Once you're done with this discussion that the.

871
01:24:53,747 --> 01:24:57,528
The residential and 80 years to December 17th.

872
01:24:58,489 --> 01:25:01,090
For the purposes of revisiting to.

873
01:25:03,622 --> 01:25:08,644
It might even be just be dead at that point and there'd be nothing no action to take, but that's the furthest that it can be.

874
01:25:10,985 --> 01:25:16,106
Yeah, continued so that's just really what's before you is when do you want to take up those squares again?

875
01:25:16,126 --> 01:25:16,206
Okay.

876
01:25:18,847 --> 01:25:23,109
And I'm thinking that August 20th is probably pointless.

877
01:25:24,309 --> 01:25:27,070
I don't have anything else on the agenda.

878
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:29,851
If there was an, you'd have to meet, but otherwise.

879
01:25:29,871 --> 01:25:31,352
September 3rd.

880
01:25:33,342 --> 01:25:36,123
Yeah, and also 80 years.

881
01:25:36,143 --> 01:25:40,185
I would do the 80s with the residential.

882
01:25:40,205 --> 01:25:42,967
Because they kind of go hand in hand.

883
01:25:42,987 --> 01:25:49,830
I see what you're saying.

884
01:25:49,850 --> 01:25:57,794
Yeah, okay.

885
01:25:58,674 --> 01:25:59,935
I feel like if we were able to.

886
01:26:03,045 --> 01:26:11,050
So right now with ADUs, there's one by right, but we don't have any guidance for anything for special permits.

887
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:18,375
So if somebody wanted to build three ADUs on their property, would they just be SOL?

888
01:26:19,696 --> 01:26:20,416
They can't do that.

889
01:26:21,237 --> 01:26:22,057
They can only build one.

890
01:26:23,358 --> 01:26:29,642
But if we were to pass local rule around ADUs that allowed

891
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:35,281
but for the possibility of, you know, one or two additional ones through special permit.

892
01:26:36,021 --> 01:26:40,362
It's only one additional one that you can for protected use.

893
01:26:41,423 --> 01:26:43,003
So we do have locally to use.

894
01:26:43,823 --> 01:26:44,684
Yes.

895
01:26:45,004 --> 01:26:46,504
I think that's what I'm referring to.

896
01:26:47,144 --> 01:26:47,364
Yeah.

897
01:26:47,424 --> 01:26:49,845
So the state law says one by right.

898
01:26:50,085 --> 01:26:51,505
And then one by right.

899
01:26:52,165 --> 01:26:58,187
And if you want a second one, it's by special permit for protected use ADU and that's in,

900
01:26:58,897 --> 01:27:01,819
only the zoning districts that allow single family homes.

901
01:27:02,659 --> 01:27:15,968
Otherwise they would, could avail themselves to a local ADU, which we do have an ordinance for, which is only for single family homes in any district.

902
01:27:16,048 --> 01:27:27,034
So if there's a random single family and say the Medford square limits, then they could have a local ADU because we already allow those.

903
01:27:27,755 --> 01:27:27,955
Okay.

904
01:27:32,631 --> 01:27:33,632
Gina, I see your hand up.

905
01:27:33,952 --> 01:27:36,054
Yeah, I was going to say thank you, Danielle.

906
01:27:36,094 --> 01:27:38,976
I was going to say the ADUs is already covered by the state.

907
01:27:39,357 --> 01:27:42,199
So the by right for the single family.

908
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:48,765
And then it would be the second ADU, just as Danielle said, which would be required from the second permit.

909
01:27:49,065 --> 01:27:51,927
So I would put together with residential.

910
01:27:51,967 --> 01:27:52,788
It just makes sense.

911
01:27:52,808 --> 01:27:54,469
It's logical to me.

912
01:27:55,330 --> 01:27:55,550
Yeah.

913
01:27:58,533 --> 01:27:59,614
Ari, I see you're off mute.

914
01:28:00,294 --> 01:28:00,775
Any thoughts?

915
01:28:04,498 --> 01:28:08,039
I think I was about to say the same thing about ADU.

916
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:10,120
I'm trying to think of if there was anything else to add.

917
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:20,924
But yeah, I do want to make sure that we don't lose all momentum out of hyper-focusing on the thing that's most difficult to schedule.

918
01:28:22,404 --> 01:28:26,686
It might be easier for us to maybe start by scheduling the things that are easy to schedule.

919
01:28:27,346 --> 01:28:33,408
Yeah, so for Medford Square and West Medford Square, because they're still

920
01:28:35,632 --> 01:28:41,437
Together, I think we can continue those both to September 3rd.

921
01:28:41,457 --> 01:28:44,399
That's the 1st.

922
01:28:52,526 --> 01:28:53,586
And then that will give.

923
01:28:55,748 --> 01:29:01,633
The consultant time to incorporate the feedback.

924
01:29:03,277 --> 01:29:24,662
And maybe that also gives city council or maybe this is an unneeded action to sever the two items so that we can move Medford Square forward while West Medford is proceeding with an economic development study.

925
01:29:27,603 --> 01:29:28,183
Okay, cool.

926
01:29:28,303 --> 01:29:30,024
And then if corridors have not been referred,

927
01:29:31,117 --> 01:29:33,098
So we don't really need to do any action there.

928
01:29:34,038 --> 01:29:42,622
But I do have the recommendations for, or the request to the consultant for on the ground footwork for at least two blocks of district edges.

929
01:29:43,922 --> 01:29:50,265
And then Ari, I'd captured your note of they're potentially going out further from the core than necessary.

930
01:29:50,645 --> 01:29:51,605
Is that what you were saying?

931
01:29:51,966 --> 01:29:55,027
Or was it just the boundaries may not be consistent?

932
01:29:56,027 --> 01:30:04,016
Yeah, and I think we've talked about it in a few different places of just those boundaries are very fact specific to those very specific areas.

933
01:30:04,256 --> 01:30:06,438
And let's make sure we're doing.

934
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:08,541
Yeah.

935
01:30:16,009 --> 01:30:17,170
Okay, well.

936
01:30:29,835 --> 01:30:33,456
So general residential, which is the NRUR.

937
01:30:38,777 --> 01:30:39,637
Public engagement.

938
01:30:42,497 --> 01:30:42,997
Delay.

939
01:30:43,017 --> 01:30:45,258
I don't have to say delay.

940
01:30:45,358 --> 01:30:52,379
I'm going to say postpone any next steps until ADUs, whereas potentially corridors are substantially complete.

941
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:55,440
Clearly outline the benefits.

942
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:57,660
What sort of benefits do we want outlined?

943
01:30:59,299 --> 01:31:01,100
just to get as specific as possible.

944
01:31:01,301 --> 01:31:02,822
I mean, there's clearly financial.

945
01:31:02,842 --> 01:31:07,986
And I'm going to say, actually, I'm going to change to consequences, because that implies positive and negative.

946
01:31:10,148 --> 01:31:16,513
And I think highlighting some of the things that are currently allowed that there is little enthusiasm for.

947
01:31:16,533 --> 01:31:21,837
You mean like uses, or what do you mean by that?

948
01:31:22,017 --> 01:31:24,539
Uses, sizes, dimensions.

949
01:31:26,218 --> 01:31:33,763
I think there is positive feedback about the Salem or no about the mystic corridor when people realize we did it.

950
01:31:33,803 --> 01:31:38,146
I don't think it got nearly as much publicity, but kind of some of the changes we made there.

951
01:31:39,047 --> 01:31:44,971
Once people learn about them, those are positive and I think talking about like, hey, right now, these things are allowed and.

952
01:31:46,215 --> 01:31:50,498
we're making sure that, you know, the next 20 years aren't built into them.

953
01:31:50,558 --> 01:31:56,722
I think that some of those things are also really worth highlighting that kind of risks of not acting.

954
01:31:59,223 --> 01:32:03,686
So one thing that I think we can put there is 15 story buildings, whether they're banks or not.

955
01:32:04,327 --> 01:32:05,688
Um, you had also mentioned lot size.

956
01:32:05,708 --> 01:32:07,289
Do you want to add some more to that?

957
01:32:07,309 --> 01:32:10,471
Ari?

958
01:32:10,491 --> 01:32:10,531
Um,

959
01:32:14,922 --> 01:32:20,068
I don't have anything specific to say on lots size at this moment, but it looks like Dina has something to add.

960
01:32:20,088 --> 01:32:22,331
Okay, Dina.

961
01:32:22,972 --> 01:32:29,440
Yeah, what I would include is as benefits would include a lot of the benefits that are outlined in the comprehensive plan.

962
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,823
So, what we're doing is we're following that.

963
01:32:32,317 --> 01:32:35,039
when we do the zoning changes.

964
01:32:35,159 --> 01:32:40,062
So we're making the changes in relationships plan, the plan that was developed by the people.

965
01:32:40,742 --> 01:32:47,466
And, you know, you could certainly see a lot of the benefits of Method Square, right, in the plan that we're doing.

966
01:32:48,367 --> 01:32:51,088
So it all kind of comes together.

967
01:32:51,108 --> 01:32:57,292
Another bank.

968
01:33:02,172 --> 01:33:06,836
Yeah, I might my dog was just doing weird stuff in the corner.

969
01:33:06,956 --> 01:33:07,896
Did you have something else to add?

970
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:10,879
No, no, thank you.

971
01:33:10,919 --> 01:33:11,239
Okay.

972
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:12,480
Okay.

973
01:33:17,864 --> 01:33:24,389
And then Ben, you have a specific feedback about Fulton Heights, and our one, look at private roads that get small loss.

974
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:27,752
And then

975
01:33:29,422 --> 01:33:38,565
Is there anything, any other kind of specific feedback we want on ADUs, Medford Square, West Medford Square, general residential, corridors?

976
01:33:38,585 --> 01:33:42,826
Because I then want to get into like general request, which is more on like the process.

977
01:33:47,588 --> 01:33:47,988
John?

978
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:59,172
When we talk about following the comprehensive plan, I've sort of pounded on this drum before,

979
01:33:59,912 --> 01:34:06,578
But one of the elements that's supposed to be included is history and culture along with open space.

980
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:17,168
And I don't see history and culture being addressed in most of these proposed zoning changes.

981
01:34:18,909 --> 01:34:20,290
What would be an example of how

982
01:34:21,856 --> 01:34:23,577
history could be incorporated.

983
01:34:23,977 --> 01:34:31,302
It doesn't have to be a specific property, but I'm just trying to build something for the consultant to go off of.

984
01:34:31,602 --> 01:34:41,669
I know, for example, that the historic commission sent a list of historic properties along the Salem Street Corridor.

985
01:34:41,689 --> 01:34:42,469
Yeah.

986
01:34:43,570 --> 01:34:48,733
I don't think any of that got incorporated into what the city council wound up passing.

987
01:34:50,479 --> 01:35:10,510
Yeah, so that's, I mean, that's a, an aspect of the process that, you know, we don't, we can't really control, like, we can make every recommendation in the world and the city council could say, hey, great work, guys, we're gonna go with the original proposal.

988
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:11,830
I don't think that they would, but

989
01:35:13,927 --> 01:35:14,047
Right.

990
01:35:14,367 --> 01:35:18,349
You know, that's something that could and has happened.

991
01:35:18,529 --> 01:35:22,611
I just, I don't know whether that feedback ever actually got through to them.

992
01:35:23,271 --> 01:35:24,152
Yeah, I don't know.

993
01:35:24,172 --> 01:35:27,754
I didn't attend that city council meeting.

994
01:35:28,194 --> 01:35:30,095
I guess we could watch it, but.

995
01:35:31,335 --> 01:35:37,818
Well, it's water under the bridge now, but moving forward is what I'm talking about.

996
01:35:38,739 --> 01:35:41,480
So maybe there is a general request of

997
01:35:49,856 --> 01:35:57,662
Maybe there's some nuance in terms of like how our recommendations are presented to the city council.

998
01:35:57,862 --> 01:36:01,084
Cause I believe it just, our list of recommendations was passed on.

999
01:36:02,305 --> 01:36:10,391
I don't think we had any members of the board there to kind of share any like additional detail.

1000
01:36:10,411 --> 01:36:11,752
Right.

1001
01:36:11,812 --> 01:36:18,777
And I think that's, that's kind of like a potentially an overreach.

1002
01:36:19,562 --> 01:36:20,123
of our work?

1003
01:36:21,464 --> 01:36:21,905
I don't know.

1004
01:36:23,487 --> 01:36:23,867
I don't know.

1005
01:36:24,728 --> 01:36:26,390
I don't think that's an overreach.

1006
01:36:26,430 --> 01:36:32,497
I think it's not something that we are obligated to do, but I don't think there's anything about it that feels inappropriate.

1007
01:36:32,637 --> 01:36:39,405
I think I would love to see this process be a bit more synchronized and collaborative.

1008
01:36:40,458 --> 01:36:50,743
Um, and I think that would substantially affect many of the procedural, uh, issues as well as the outcomes.

1009
01:36:50,843 --> 01:36:52,143
So, okay.

1010
01:36:54,985 --> 01:36:56,025
And I see Danielle's hand.

1011
01:36:57,546 --> 01:36:59,847
Um, thank you, madam chair.

1012
01:36:59,967 --> 01:37:08,651
One thing I was just thinking about is you could have a joint meeting with city council to just talk about zoning and be in the same room together.

1013
01:37:09,843 --> 01:37:17,249
That is a thing that could that could be done and I've, I've worked in, I've worked in settings where we had that we've done that.

1014
01:37:18,130 --> 01:37:21,793
Oh, God, I feel like I want to save this up.

1015
01:37:22,634 --> 01:37:26,957
Because even though, you know, I write a report and I get the minutes and.

1016
01:37:28,618 --> 01:37:32,682
Attend the meetings if there's questions, but, um.

1017
01:37:33,533 --> 01:37:45,602
You know, I'm the intermediary, but that could be something that you all could request as you would like to have a joint meeting, a joint public hearing to discuss the zoning.

1018
01:37:47,463 --> 01:37:56,810
May I comment that I actually suggested this informally to a member of the permitting and planning committee, and he was horrified by the idea.

1019
01:37:56,830 --> 01:37:58,732
Boo!

1020
01:38:02,142 --> 01:38:06,286
He said it would be inappropriate for an elected body to meet with an appointed body.

1021
01:38:07,307 --> 01:38:22,359
So maybe there needs to be, because my assumption was like, you know, we need to stay so separate, but maybe there's some education that is needed, you know, on the board side, as well as the city council side in terms of like, hey, this is something that could happen.

1022
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,221
There'd be some benefits to it.

1023
01:38:24,241 --> 01:38:26,383
I mean, I just learned something tonight, so.

1024
01:38:26,743 --> 01:38:28,185
They can happen and they do happen.

1025
01:38:29,204 --> 01:38:29,504
Yeah.

1026
01:38:29,664 --> 01:38:36,246
Other places in Massachusetts, Watertown, when we were working on rezoning an area.

1027
01:38:36,266 --> 01:38:36,866
Yeah.

1028
01:38:37,686 --> 01:38:41,467
I think it was that the first meeting, first public hearing was joint.

1029
01:38:42,468 --> 01:38:42,768
Yeah.

1030
01:38:44,928 --> 01:38:45,789
Dina, I see your hand.

1031
01:38:48,489 --> 01:38:49,170
Oh, you're still on mute.

1032
01:38:49,490 --> 01:38:50,390
I'm still on mute, sorry.

1033
01:38:50,810 --> 01:38:55,391
Just to bring up a can of worms, probably with the joint meeting with the city council.

1034
01:38:55,411 --> 01:38:58,092
I mean, is it even possible to bring up the Salem Street?

1035
01:38:59,092 --> 01:39:03,735
the, you know, the annex MX one to the MX two.

1036
01:39:06,176 --> 01:39:10,939
I mean, I think as far as that's concerned, it's, you know, it was already voted on by city council.

1037
01:39:10,959 --> 01:39:18,483
I know the mayor mentioned something on my address, and I don't know what the path forward is on that.

1038
01:39:19,423 --> 01:39:23,686
I think it's really up to city council and the mayor to kind of work through that.

1039
01:39:24,508 --> 01:39:28,890
Um, as the community development board, I think we would receive whatever is referred back to us.

1040
01:39:31,271 --> 01:39:35,092
But, yeah, I don't know that might be a good question for follow up.

1041
01:39:35,152 --> 01:39:37,933
But, yeah, I, I love this idea for a joint meeting.

1042
01:39:37,953 --> 01:39:40,234
I love the, um.

1043
01:39:41,595 --> 01:39:44,356
And, yeah, just so we're all hearing the same information at the same time.

1044
01:39:44,656 --> 01:39:45,656
So, you know, maybe we're not.

1045
01:39:46,236 --> 01:39:48,097
Yeah, I know I'm using Royal.

1046
01:39:48,137 --> 01:39:50,558
We in the extreme here, but, um.

1047
01:39:51,405 --> 01:39:57,447
you know, maybe, you know, we don't discuss maybe, you know, nothing's decided, but, you know, we're at least all kind of in the same room.

1048
01:39:57,467 --> 01:40:08,671
And especially if there's public comment, like hearing from constituents, because I think, I think city council would have really benefited from hearing a lot of the comments that were shared by the public.

1049
01:40:10,252 --> 01:40:12,252
I know we're, you know, we're synthesizing them as a board.

1050
01:40:12,853 --> 01:40:16,634
But I think that would have been a really beneficial activity for them.

1051
01:40:18,615 --> 01:40:19,115
Okay, so

1052
01:40:20,092 --> 01:40:45,308
I started highlighting items that are not necessarily for the consultant and more, um, you know, maybe not requests, but, um, would be nice to have, uh, with the city council and that's severing, uh, Medford square West Medford square joint meeting.

1053
01:40:45,328 --> 01:40:47,469
Okay.

1054
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:56,263
Um, I think this is also a potentially city council, potentially mayoral request.

1055
01:40:57,283 --> 01:41:06,486
Um, and over the past couple of months, um, I've taken it upon myself to do a little bit of, of personal and public outreach around previous zoning efforts.

1056
01:41:07,466 --> 01:41:13,169
Um, you know, I've had great conversations with a couple of members of the public.

1057
01:41:13,749 --> 01:41:17,210
Um, I think I saw one of them on the call earlier.

1058
01:41:17,898 --> 01:41:34,743
Um, I think they've since jumped off, but, uh, Paul's not on anymore, but, um, as well as some of my former colleagues from the city of Somerville, which I know Medford is not Somerville or we're so different in terms of like city makeup.

1059
01:41:35,723 --> 01:41:40,865
Um, so we're not them and I'm not trying to make that comparison, but there was, um,

1060
01:41:43,498 --> 01:41:48,662
at least one 100% city staff resource dedicated to the zoning effort.

1061
01:41:49,383 --> 01:41:52,706
And I would request that the same is done here in Medford.

1062
01:41:55,448 --> 01:42:01,653
Danielle and Alicia and team are working literally at their limit.

1063
01:42:02,474 --> 01:42:05,836
And that's not the way to get this work done.

1064
01:42:06,537 --> 01:42:12,101
So I know that's not something for Edison associates, but I wanna kind of pass that request on.

1065
01:42:15,901 --> 01:42:19,183
I also took notes on the involvement of other city departments.

1066
01:42:20,144 --> 01:42:22,685
John, I know you mentioned specifically the historic commission.

1067
01:42:25,187 --> 01:42:37,796
We've heard from DPW, we heard from fire department kind of unofficially, and I appreciate the representative's participation in public comment, but maybe we need to get something a little bit more official.

1068
01:42:39,317 --> 01:42:41,519
Are there other departments that we'd wanna kind of call out

1069
01:42:49,956 --> 01:42:50,256
Tina?

1070
01:42:51,257 --> 01:42:51,777
Traffic.

1071
01:42:52,878 --> 01:42:53,338
Traffic.

1072
01:42:54,318 --> 01:42:54,779
Parking.

1073
01:42:56,239 --> 01:42:56,519
OK.

1074
01:42:57,220 --> 01:42:57,660
Schools.

1075
01:43:02,823 --> 01:43:03,183
OK.

1076
01:43:03,303 --> 01:43:10,667
You need traffic studies to do, like, if you increase the density in an area, what is the impact on traffic?

1077
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:19,482
So traffic is evaluated on like a site by, on a project by project basis in front of the board.

1078
01:43:19,582 --> 01:43:38,930
So we don't have a traffic study for like the whole rezoning, but I think what could be done is like engaging with a traffic and parking consultant for them to kind of extrapolate, like given a, I don't know, like, I mean, I know Peter's not on the line, like he'd probably have more insight than I do, but,

1079
01:43:39,973 --> 01:43:49,340
You know, given 100% build out to these new zoning standards, you can expect X increase in traffic or cars given 80%, 50%.

1080
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:59,668
Like, I don't know what sort of like vacancy rate they build in, but I think that would be something that would probably be more productive than traffic and parking.

1081
01:44:00,409 --> 01:44:04,052
Like, department comments, but there would definitely be a higher cost to that.

1082
01:44:05,541 --> 01:44:17,844
Yeah, I just think that just where I live, if it ever creates the density, College Avenue is blocked up way past George Street to try to get on just in the morning.

1083
01:44:18,664 --> 01:44:21,045
The traffic is terrible in the area.

1084
01:44:21,285 --> 01:44:24,646
And keep in mind, this is the summer months.

1085
01:44:25,046 --> 01:44:27,626
The college comes on back, I know.

1086
01:44:28,106 --> 01:44:29,427
So those things are important.

1087
01:44:30,247 --> 01:44:34,068
I mean, I'm right by Wellington Circle, and it's terrible.

1088
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:35,400
It's horrible.

1089
01:44:35,901 --> 01:44:46,328
I'm very grateful that I have the opportunity to take the orange line into work, but in the couple of days where I do have to to move around in my car.

1090
01:44:47,829 --> 01:44:49,370
God, it's an exercise in insanity.

1091
01:44:49,390 --> 01:44:53,553
Okay, so maybe there's traffic impact study.

1092
01:44:53,573 --> 01:45:02,640
Okay, there's also 2 studies that the city of Somerville did, which I think would be interesting for.

1093
01:45:03,682 --> 01:45:08,046
maybe city staff to evaluate whether they would be productive.

1094
01:45:09,387 --> 01:45:11,949
One is called an economic impact study.

1095
01:45:12,510 --> 01:45:15,832
I've heard several members of the public also mention something like this.

1096
01:45:15,852 --> 01:45:21,177
I'm going to go ahead and share screen quickly.

1097
01:45:30,852 --> 01:45:40,519
So this is a site that was done Feb 2016 by RCL Co and it captures so much information.

1098
01:45:40,539 --> 01:45:43,882
It includes parking, employment, underutilization.

1099
01:45:43,902 --> 01:45:57,131
It analyzes the actual permitting process as it stands and presents a wealth of information in terms of current status quo as well as moving forward.

1100
01:45:57,412 --> 01:45:58,933
So I think something like this

1101
01:46:00,846 --> 01:46:02,146
could be beneficial for the city.

1102
01:46:02,166 --> 01:46:04,247
I don't know the price point for it.

1103
01:46:04,587 --> 01:46:09,929
And I realize that that is a restriction for kind of the work that we're doing forward.

1104
01:46:09,949 --> 01:46:13,810
So I captured that.

1105
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:20,612
And then the other thing that, actually, I don't think this was relevant.

1106
01:46:21,433 --> 01:46:28,355
There was also a, it's called the RARB study that was done.

1107
01:46:29,801 --> 01:46:31,723
Am I still sharing my screen?

1108
01:46:35,567 --> 01:46:35,807
Yes.

1109
01:46:36,448 --> 01:46:37,149
Okay, great.

1110
01:46:42,314 --> 01:46:46,118
So this was analysis and discussion of current residential zoning regulation.

1111
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:58,094
I know we've already done a lot of maps of current conditions for Somerville, so this might be duplicative work, but I think it would be helpful document for us to reference in terms of the work that was done.

1112
01:46:58,495 --> 01:47:10,499
Again, I'm not sure of the cost of this, but it's a very in-depth study of residential in a neighboring neighborhood or neighboring city.

1113
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,460
So those are two items that I called out

1114
01:47:16,783 --> 01:47:19,263
You know, maybe we're also requesting a traffic impact study.

1115
01:47:19,283 --> 01:47:28,525
Yeah, that's kind of the, that's the feedback that I've captured to date.

1116
01:47:36,286 --> 01:47:36,866
How are we feeling?

1117
01:47:38,027 --> 01:47:45,548
We're just about at the, I think hour and a half, hour 15 mark of this discussion.

1118
01:47:49,789 --> 01:47:53,450
And we do have the executive session just to remind the board.

1119
01:47:53,490 --> 01:47:59,812
Yeah, I would like to move forward to a different topic if we can, just to keep things moving.

1120
01:48:00,352 --> 01:48:11,856
So I did receive some information from city staff that continuing to 9-3, September 3rd, may be a bit optimistic given the

1121
01:48:16,234 --> 01:48:26,356
Given kind of getting the consultant back on board, we have a couple board vacancies that are coming up and being reappointed.

1122
01:48:26,376 --> 01:48:37,658
So it might make more sense to delay it until September 17th, which I believe is the following meeting.

1123
01:48:39,558 --> 01:48:40,718
Any reactions to that?

1124
01:48:40,738 --> 01:48:44,479
The other option is delaying it to October 1st.

1125
01:48:45,549 --> 01:48:47,070
which would give even more time.

1126
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:53,174
And to be honest, it's because of how the first and third Wednesdays fall.

1127
01:48:54,775 --> 01:48:58,478
It's really just like two weeks later, as opposed to sometimes three.

1128
01:49:02,923 --> 01:49:05,864
How about... I would prefer October 1st.

1129
01:49:06,104 --> 01:49:06,964
Sorry, go ahead.

1130
01:49:07,624 --> 01:49:10,624
So October 1st is not going to be... is Yom Kippur.

1131
01:49:10,924 --> 01:49:12,045
So we're not having... Oh, okay.

1132
01:49:12,165 --> 01:49:12,925
Yeah, we can't do that.

1133
01:49:13,205 --> 01:49:16,005
So it's the 15th and the 29th of the meetings.

1134
01:49:18,466 --> 01:49:19,046
Of October.

1135
01:49:19,846 --> 01:49:20,886
So October 15th.

1136
01:49:22,246 --> 01:49:23,346
Any reactions to that?

1137
01:49:24,547 --> 01:49:25,947
Just give me a thumbs up if that works.

1138
01:49:29,448 --> 01:49:29,708
Okay.

1139
01:49:30,368 --> 01:49:31,448
Tina, I don't see a thumb.

1140
01:49:31,668 --> 01:49:32,228
Was it off screen?

1141
01:49:35,941 --> 01:49:39,503
Sorry, you're on mute.

1142
01:49:40,124 --> 01:49:40,764
Okay, great.

1143
01:49:40,804 --> 01:49:41,144
Thank you.

1144
01:49:41,204 --> 01:49:42,405
Okay, so we'll say 1015.

1145
01:49:42,445 --> 01:49:42,945
Okay.

1146
01:49:42,965 --> 01:50:00,536
So I'm going to go ahead and share screen just so we can do a quick.

1147
01:50:01,797 --> 01:50:03,618
Actually, no, I've read all this by word by.

1148
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:05,801
No, I will.

1149
01:50:05,901 --> 01:50:06,501
Just real quick.

1150
01:50:11,565 --> 01:50:11,846
OK.

1151
01:50:12,746 --> 01:50:17,130
So this is the document that I'm going to share with Danielle.

1152
01:50:18,111 --> 01:50:22,054
I think it contains most of the things that we've talked about.

1153
01:50:22,214 --> 01:50:26,837
But doing a quick review, if you see something that is off, speak up.

1154
01:50:26,857 --> 01:50:32,542
I'm going to stay on these two pages for about a minute.

1155
01:50:51,472 --> 01:50:52,413
Can I go to the next page?

1156
01:50:52,433 --> 01:50:55,074
These are just general requests.

1157
01:51:01,098 --> 01:51:02,139
And I will spell check this.

1158
01:51:09,684 --> 01:51:09,964
All right.

1159
01:51:13,186 --> 01:51:13,566
Thank you.

1160
01:51:13,646 --> 01:51:14,227
Nice job.

1161
01:51:15,588 --> 01:51:16,228
Hi, you're welcome.

1162
01:51:16,829 --> 01:51:23,893
If this is the type of work you want to do with your involvement in the board, there is a clerk role that has been vacant for the past.

1163
01:51:23,913 --> 01:51:26,234
8 months.

1164
01:51:30,116 --> 01:51:31,157
Okay, so for.

1165
01:51:31,177 --> 01:51:34,639
Let me go back to my dock.

1166
01:51:34,839 --> 01:51:42,143
Okay, so what I'm looking for now is a motion to continue each hearing to a date.

1167
01:51:42,163 --> 01:51:44,184
Certain what we've talked about is.

1168
01:51:45,490 --> 01:52:05,509
Continuing Medford Square and West Medford Square districts to October 15th, and then continuing ADUs and general residential to December 17th.

1169
01:52:09,635 --> 01:52:11,137
Looking for a motion.

1170
01:52:11,757 --> 01:52:12,017
Yes.

1171
01:52:12,518 --> 01:52:12,838
Awesome.

1172
01:52:12,898 --> 01:52:13,459
Thanks Ari.

1173
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,482
Wait, am I allowed to do it?

1174
01:52:16,642 --> 01:52:17,983
I'm an alternate JK.

1175
01:52:18,023 --> 01:52:18,404
Sorry.

1176
01:52:18,544 --> 01:52:19,144
Stepping down.

1177
01:52:19,164 --> 01:52:19,285
Yeah.

1178
01:52:20,165 --> 01:52:20,466
Yeah.

1179
01:52:21,026 --> 01:52:22,588
Seconded.

1180
01:52:22,648 --> 01:52:27,813
So I don't think Ari was eligible to make a move, to make a motion.

1181
01:52:27,833 --> 01:52:28,974
I move.

1182
01:52:29,715 --> 01:52:30,195
Thank you.

1183
01:52:30,356 --> 01:52:31,457
So now we're looking for a second.

1184
01:52:32,777 --> 01:52:33,457
I'll second it.

1185
01:52:34,097 --> 01:52:34,757
Thank you, Dina.

1186
01:52:35,117 --> 01:52:37,158
Dina's first motion.

1187
01:52:37,298 --> 01:52:37,698
Yay.

1188
01:52:39,898 --> 01:52:41,039
So we're going to do a roll call vote.

1189
01:52:41,479 --> 01:52:43,379
I'm going to call him as I see him.

1190
01:52:43,479 --> 01:52:47,980
Ari, I am going to ask for your vote just out of abundance of caution.

1191
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:52,781
If your vote is not eligible, then we just don't include it.

1192
01:52:54,881 --> 01:53:01,022
But one thing I will say is that Ari has been a fabulous member of the board

1193
01:53:01,693 --> 01:53:06,534
Um, they take a balanced and fair and educated approach to all the work that they do.

1194
01:53:06,554 --> 01:53:11,496
And I think that Ari would make a wonderful full member of the board.

1195
01:53:11,576 --> 01:53:24,860
And I would encourage the mayor to pursue that path forward rather than associate member, um, partly in recognition of the work that Ari's done, um, and mostly in recognition of the work that they can continue to do for the city.

1196
01:53:25,835 --> 01:53:30,799
So with that, I'm going to take a roll call vote.

1197
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:32,080
Dina?

1198
01:53:33,181 --> 01:53:33,401
Yes.

1199
01:53:34,482 --> 01:53:34,722
Ben?

1200
01:53:34,742 --> 01:53:37,063
Aye.

1201
01:53:38,004 --> 01:53:38,324
Ari?

1202
01:53:40,626 --> 01:53:40,786
Aye.

1203
01:53:41,627 --> 01:53:41,887
John?

1204
01:53:41,907 --> 01:53:43,168
Aye.

1205
01:53:44,149 --> 01:53:44,369
Adam?

1206
01:53:44,389 --> 01:53:45,370
Aye.

1207
01:53:46,350 --> 01:53:48,272
And myself, Emily Hedeman is also an aye.

1208
01:53:48,965 --> 01:54:04,116
to continue Medford Square and West Medford Square to October 15th, continue ADUs and general residential, which is the neighborhood residential, urban residential to December 17th, and just generally pass on all of this feedback to the consultant.

1209
01:54:05,597 --> 01:54:05,898
Cool.

1210
01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:09,861
So the next item we have in front of us is

1211
01:54:15,253 --> 01:54:16,794
I'm going to go straight to executive session.

1212
01:54:18,014 --> 01:54:19,015
Just skipping over a minute.

1213
01:54:19,555 --> 01:54:20,516
Did we vote on that?

1214
01:54:21,776 --> 01:54:22,817
We have not voted on it.

1215
01:54:24,238 --> 01:54:24,398
No.

1216
01:54:24,818 --> 01:54:24,938
Okay.

1217
01:54:25,078 --> 01:54:25,118
No.

1218
01:54:25,138 --> 01:54:29,140
There's a little blurb that I need to read to pull us into it.

1219
01:54:29,601 --> 01:54:33,042
Did we vote on the continuance to December for general residential?

1220
01:54:33,523 --> 01:54:33,763
Yes.

1221
01:54:33,843 --> 01:54:34,983
I did everything combined.

1222
01:54:35,484 --> 01:54:35,924
Okay.

1223
01:54:36,424 --> 01:54:36,664
Yes.

1224
01:54:37,285 --> 01:54:39,346
Yeah.

1225
01:54:39,846 --> 01:54:41,066
But always good to check.

1226
01:54:41,227 --> 01:54:41,627
Thank you, John.

1227
01:54:42,998 --> 01:55:01,967
So the next agenda item we have is executive session pursuant to Massachusetts General Law Chapter 30A, Section 21A, Purpose 3, to discuss strategy with respect to pending litigation known as New York Capital Investment Group, LLC v. Medford Community Development Board et al., Massachusetts Land Court, Case No.

1228
01:55:01,987 --> 01:55:05,028
24, MISC 000683.

1229
01:55:06,089 --> 01:55:12,532
If the chair declares that discussing the matter in an open meeting may have detrimental effect on litigating position of the board,

1230
01:55:15,156 --> 01:55:22,841
Danielle, do you know if Attorney Stein is available at this time?

1231
01:55:24,162 --> 01:55:25,243
I just texted her.

1232
01:55:25,263 --> 01:55:26,223
Okay.

1233
01:55:28,545 --> 01:55:31,186
She told me to text her when we're ready for her.

1234
01:55:31,206 --> 01:55:38,431
Okay, so I'm going to ask for a motion to enter into executive session.

1235
01:55:38,451 --> 01:55:39,812
We're going to do a roll call vote.

1236
01:55:43,658 --> 01:55:44,259
Thank you, John.

1237
01:55:44,319 --> 01:55:44,999
Can I have a second?

1238
01:55:46,199 --> 01:55:46,679
I'll second.

1239
01:55:47,259 --> 01:55:47,920
Thank you, Adam.

1240
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,180
I'm going to call you as I see you.

1241
01:55:51,001 --> 01:55:51,321
Dina?

1242
01:55:54,181 --> 01:55:54,422
Yes.

1243
01:55:55,382 --> 01:55:55,622
Ben?

1244
01:55:55,642 --> 01:55:57,743
Aye.

1245
01:55:58,743 --> 01:55:59,023
Ari?

1246
01:56:00,463 --> 01:56:00,603
Aye.

1247
01:56:01,204 --> 01:56:01,504
John?

1248
01:56:01,524 --> 01:56:02,484
Aye.

1249
01:56:03,184 --> 01:56:03,404
Adam?

1250
01:56:03,424 --> 01:56:05,985
Aye.

1251
01:56:06,947 --> 01:56:09,187
And I, Emily Hadiman, am also an aye.

1252
01:56:10,188 --> 01:56:15,529
So the board will now move into executive session and will not reconvene in open session.

1253
01:56:15,549 --> 01:56:18,189
Oh, no, we will reconvene because we have to do the minutes.

1254
01:56:19,409 --> 01:56:21,810
Actually, we didn't have any ready.

1255
01:56:22,470 --> 01:56:23,590
OK, so no minutes.

1256
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:27,831
Christian did prepare them, but I did not have a chance to review them.

1257
01:56:27,851 --> 01:56:30,832
OK, so that kind of works out.

1258
01:56:34,255 --> 01:56:37,257
Oh man fans, God laughs, laughing in my favor tonight.

1259
01:56:38,157 --> 01:56:44,541
So the board will now move into executive session and we will not reconvene an open session at the conclusion of executive session.

1260
01:56:45,401 --> 01:56:50,624
We're going to move into a breakout room for the duration of executive session and we'll adjourn within executive session.

1261
01:56:51,544 --> 01:56:54,126
For members of the public that have joined us this evening, thank you so much.

1262
01:56:54,406 --> 01:57:03,051
We appreciate your continued involvement and we look forward to sharing the next iteration of feedback, or next iteration of

1263
01:57:04,188 --> 01:57:05,209
zoning proposals with you.

1264
01:57:06,230 --> 01:57:12,775
And it's been an honor to chair the meetings that you've also enthusiastically participated in.

1265
01:57:12,876 --> 01:57:16,399
So look forward to being on your side of the zoom call next time.

1266
01:57:19,121 --> 01:57:19,761
Cheers, everyone.

1267
01:57:21,383 --> 01:57:22,504
And board stay on the line.

1268
01:57:22,564 --> 01:57:23,745
We're going to go into a meeting room.

1269
01:58:00,038 --> 01:58:01,679
Daniel, are you all set with the breakout rooms?

1270
01:58:01,799 --> 01:58:02,980
You need anything from me there?

1271
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:07,422
I'm trying to see.

1272
01:58:07,522 --> 01:58:09,983
I'm trying to see if I have everybody here.

1273
01:58:10,003 --> 01:58:10,764
Okay.

1274
01:58:12,004 --> 01:58:16,527
Adam, Ari, Ben, Dina, Emily.
