    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=25.625s">Welcome</a>  to the show Meeting Interested People. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=28.166s">Today</a>  my guest Louise Mastuchuat. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=32.227s">And</a>  I think if I just say Louise, everybody knows you. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=34.668s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=35.968s">Because</a>  you're involved in everywhere, like events around Medford, Circle the Square, Cachet. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=45.912s">By</a>  the way, what is Cachet?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=47.472s">CACHE</a>  means Coalition for Arts, Culture and a Healthy Economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=52.934s">So</a>  what that means is we want to take arts and culture and involve the businesses throughout the city to recognize and appreciate it and help us put that forth to the entire city.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=66.318s">Okay,</a>  so Louise and I, we met when I was taking her class, when she was teaching PMC, pure metal clay, jewelry. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=76.085s">Unfortunately,</a>  the gallery does not exist anymore, where the classes were held. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=82.23s">Hopefully,</a>  some people in Medford City Hall will listen to us and give us the opportunity to show how many talented people live in town, in the city, that they can show <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=95.415s">tremendous</a>  amount of artwork.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=98.677s">Well,</a>  I'd like to tell you about that because it will be in the Medford transcript today, so I won't be giving away secrets. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=106.04s">There</a>  is a group of us, and we are calling for Arts Collaborative Medford, and we are looking for a home for arts and culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=117.166s">We've</a>  been working on this <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=119.727s">Well,</a>  I've been working on it for a few years with a couple of city councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=125.589s">And</a>  now we have a group that, with like minds, are going to try to work on this and be fundraising and awareness and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=138.193s">It'll</a>  probably take a while, but I think we'll do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=141.153s">We're</a>  very determined to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=142.794s">So</a>  I'm very excited about this.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=145.195s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=147.176s">The</a>  dream will come true. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=148.498s">Yes,</a>  it will. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=150.56s">And</a>  so this is new, a media you started working with. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=154.705s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=155.446s">And</a>  tell us about why, how you came upon this particular... Okay.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=162.114s">Well,</a>  first let me say that, like you say, I did precious metal clay. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=172.121s">I</a>  bought, made it, sold it, taught classes in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=176.764s">And</a>  you get to a point where people say, do you do anything else? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=182.848s">And</a>  I thought, well, yeah, I do a lot of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=184.77s">I</a>  volunteer. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=185.571s">I</a>  belong to this organization, that organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=188.493s">But</a>  they seem to want more from me for some reason, like that wasn't enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=192.977s">So</a>  all of a sudden, I'm a YouTuber. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=196.6s">So</a>  I learned most of my precious clay metal jewelry from YouTube videos. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=202.845s">DVDs</a>  and so I went on YouTube and I thought I'd like to start doing things with mixed media like in painting and colors and learning about textures. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=216.189s">So</a>  I started this journal and I learned about different kinds of molding paste, using sand, using objects, different kind of paints, sprays, watercolors. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=228.833s">So</a>  I made like a journal. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=230.793s">And</a>  then one day when I was on YouTube, I saw this acrylic abstract painting and I always thought, oh, I can't paint or draw or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=242.845s">And</a>  people would say to me, you're so creative. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=245.127s">Don't</a>  you draw? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=246.088s">Don't</a>  you paint? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=248.23s">And</a>  I'd say, no, I can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=250.412s">So</a>  I came across <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=253.615s">this</a>  YouTube video that talked about accidental painting. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=259.798s">And</a>  I said probably everything I do is going to be an accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=264.96s">So</a>  it was discovered back in the 1930s by a very famous painter who <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=271.563s">I</a>  don't remember his name, but he's in every gallery worldwide and he's in MoMA in New York and whatever and he stumbled upon it when he decided to mix paints together instead of doing it with a brush. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=288.147s">and</a>  he poured it on the canvas and he tilted it and he added things to it and It was beautiful and people loved it and said oh, I like your new work He didn't think it was his new work. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=299.417s">He</a>  thought it was his work.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=300.678s">Mm-hmm.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=301.619s">So</a>  I Delved into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=304.802s">I</a>  had I bought a lot of things about tons of paint about you need to have pouring mediums you need to <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=312.338s">learn</a>  all about density and opacity of paints, which I never knew before. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=319.64s">And</a>  then it's all trial and error. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=322.021s">And</a>  so I started buying canvases, some inexpensive because I felt like they were going to be flops. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=330.264s">And</a>  the first few I did were unrecognizable. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=334.565s">All</a>  the paint muddled together and I had brown and orange and I did not intend to have those colors. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=341.327s">So,</a>  I belong to Danvers Art Association in Danvers. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=345.591s">It's</a>  a great organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=348.373s">It's</a>  about 100 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=350.575s">And</a>  they acquired a beautiful schoolhouse from the town, and they just maintain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=355.799s">They</a>  raise all their money through shows and the auction once a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=360.302s">They</a>  raise enough to heat the building, electricity, and just keep it going. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=365.566s">And</a>  so a friend of mine who is a member, <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=369.049s">He</a>  said to me, why don't you join? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=371.911s">So</a>  I joined. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=373.652s">And</a>  the first time I did anything was the Christmas fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=377.975s">And</a>  I actually had my jewelry and some crocheted items. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=383.539s">And</a>  so then comes along the spring show. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=388.163s">I</a>  did the jewelry again. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=390.344s">Came</a>  the fall show. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=392.426s">And</a>  all of a sudden, it's a jewelry art show. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=396.497s">So</a>  I said, I'd love to put something up on the wall just to get people's impression actually of my artwork to see if I have any talent. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=409.746s">And</a>  I could walk around the room during this show as a member and listen to people talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=416.05s">And</a>  I heard some really good comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=418.271s">So</a>  I should have probably taken this one out first. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=422.134s">So</a>  this actually is the one <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=425.847s">that</a>  I submitted amongst the others. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=428.327s">Oh,</a>  that's pretty. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=429.468s">And</a>  I won third place ribbon. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=432.888s">And</a>  as I walked around that night of the show, I said, oh, this one won a ribbon, that one won a ribbon. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=442.91s">And</a>  I was called into the other room and said, look who else won a ribbon. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=447.651s">And</a>  my friend, who had introduced me to Danvers Art Association, Bob Marcellino, who you know, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=455.352s">had</a>  won a beautiful ribbon like first place or second place. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=459.216s">And</a>  then he said, no, no, no, not me. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=461.377s">And</a>  he brought me over to my painting. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=463.759s">I</a>  saw that ribbon and I can't tell you, I mean, I was screaming, I won a ribbon, I won a ribbon. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=471.866s">And</a>  so, <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=473.547s">And</a>  everybody was like, okay, we know now because we hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=478.23s">And</a>  so very probably some of my favorite colors are in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=484.613s">The</a>  teal I really love. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=486.194s">And</a>  so I use <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=488.235s">very</a>  different techniques and that's why I brought different ones to show you techniques. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=493.337s">So</a>  we'll talk about this one, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=494.697s">This</a>  is called the tree ring. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=496.958s">And</a>  so what I do with this, several things actually, it's a pour and a tree ring. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=503.12s">So</a>  what I did with this was I knew the colors I wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=507.201s">This</a>  basically came the way I wanted it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=509.161s">It</a>  very rarely does. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=511.142s">And</a>  I layered the colors into a cup. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=514.163s">I</a>  had to mix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=514.983s">You</a>  have to mix it to a certain <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=517.991s">pouring</a>  consistency so that some of the paints that are opaque will go to the bottom of the cup and then the others will sit on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=530.253s">and</a>  others will pour through it, depending on what you want the outcome to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=535.015s">So</a>  this, called the tree ring, you basically fill your cup. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=538.196s">Yeah,</a>  you can see the... Right. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=539.877s">You</a>  basically fill your cup, but I didn't just want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=542.518s">There</a>  are some that are just a whole circle and they just keep going around and around, and they're lovely, but I kind of wanted this to go over. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=549.821s">So</a>  when I did that, I held the cup, and you have to hold your head steady. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=555.124s">and</a>  go in a little tight little circle, tight little circle, tight little circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=559.668s">And</a>  you can see these are so much closer than this part. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=564.032s">And</a>  then I decided, well, what would happen if I let go a little bit and go a little bit wider and a little bit wider and a little bit wider? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=571.038s">And</a>  then I left it there because the next thing in the cup was going to be white. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=575.782s">I</a>  really didn't want white in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=578.063s">So</a>  I just pulled the cup up and I poured the rest of it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=582.406s">So</a>  then you see, very different. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=584.708s">And</a>  I got a few little planets going on there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=587.911s">Right,</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=588.411s">And</a>  cells. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=589.512s">So</a>  everybody who does this type of abstract painting complains, I don't get any cells. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=597.157s">Some</a>  of the things you can put in there are silicone, treadmill oils, alcohol, different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=606.059s">So</a>  it's canvas.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=607.099s">It's</a>  on canvas.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=607.639s">This</a>  is on canvas, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=609.24s">I</a>  work on canvas. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=610.58s">I'll</a>  talk more about other substrates. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=614.081s">So</a>  this is on canvas. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=615.381s">So</a>  what year is that you did? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=617.342s">I</a>  did this last year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=619.782s">I</a>  started June...</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=624.283s">2017.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=624.423s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=625.864s">And</a>  in the fall, I want my first ribbon. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=628.004s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=628.685s">I</a>  frame some of my things. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=630.585s">Yeah,</a>  it's interesting.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=631.325s">It's</a>  like a box thing, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=632.906s">Yeah,</a>  it's actually sort of like a shadow box, but it doesn't, you know, it has the painting be able to come out a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=643.009s">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=643.629s">And</a>  it really frames it well. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=645.07s">These</a>  are my favorite types of frames.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=647.511s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=648.211s">And</a>  then you have to put it all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=650.011s">It's</a>  wood, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=650.672s">No,</a>  it's wooden. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=651.832s">So</a>  it takes some drilling and you get acquainted with your electric drill again. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=659.394s">And</a>  so from here, there were two other paintings that I had put in for the juried show, and the other two people liked better than this, and some said, no, this was interesting, but the others were very different. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=677.72s">And</a>  so, <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=679.2s">It</a>  encouraged me to just keep on going. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=683.723s">I</a>  just kept on going and so then... You want me to put this back? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=689.186s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=689.666s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=690.707s">So</a>  this past, was it November, we did the Beebe Estate Artisanal Ladies. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=700.592s">There</a>  were 10 of us there. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=702.808s">and</a>  all different types of mediums. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=706.472s">There</a>  was painting, photography, a lot of fiber arts, beautiful jewelry, and then some things like some holistic renderings and music to go with them and beautiful candles that people made. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=724.032s">A</a>  very interesting show. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=725.333s">It</a>  was probably one of the nicest shows that I've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=728.634s">So</a>  this is running every year, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=730.715s">Every</a>  year we have done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=733.236s">The</a>  BB Estate has once a month for each type of shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=739.74s">And</a>  so this was my third Artisanal Ladies. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=745.302s">it</a>  is all filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=746.063s">We</a>  need to tell our viewers that's Melrose. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=748.624s">I'm</a>  sorry yeah so that's held in the BB Estate in Melrose which is a lovely little old house. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=755.048s">A</a>  lot of character, a lot of architecture and so you think you're visiting somebody's home that has beautiful artwork in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=764.233s">And</a>  so, yeah, we'd like more of that in Medford, I'll tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=770.317s">And</a>  I know Mackie has been doing some wonderful new things with art and inviting artists to show their work and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=780.365s">But</a>  I would like to see a lot more, a lot more venues. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=784.287s">So,</a>  I continued and I needed to have paintings to put up on the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=791.012s">I</a>  had a few, but not anything substantial. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=794.353s">So</a>  after the Danvers show, I started really painting a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=801.035s">This</a>  is one of my favorites. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=803.276s">And</a>  as you see, almost the same colors as the first one. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=807.297s">And</a>  that's why I brought it, to show you that you can use almost the same color, except this is gold. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=814.14s">Yeah,</a>  there was an orangey gold, and black, and teal, which I love, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=821.122s">So</a>  it's the same cop, different layers. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=825.164s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=825.744s">So</a>  what I did know, so on this one, I actually, and you could do it many ways, the way you like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=832.307s">I</a>  actually asked my Facebook friend <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=836.344s">art</a>  group, which way should I do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=839.786s">And</a>  we all agreed this was the way, but you can't change this. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=843.068s">So</a>  in this one, I actually just mixed the certain colors and I poured it over the canvas, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=850.952s">And</a>  in different shapes and sizes of thinness of it, thickness of the lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=859.537s">And</a>  then I took black and I swiped it with a piece of paper Oh, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=867.044s">And</a>  so you just swipe it and what happens is the black is opaque And the colors are not and I did their transport they call transparent So what I did with this one is I put a little bit of treadmill oil in the other colors aside from black so that when you <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=888.581s">when</a>  you take the paper or whatever object you want and go across the paint, then all of the oils will come out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=898.806s">Because</a>  the black is opaque, it has the paint peep through. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=904.129s">So</a>  then, that was okay, but it was black and teal. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=908.612s">And</a>  I'm starting to like gold a lot.</p>
