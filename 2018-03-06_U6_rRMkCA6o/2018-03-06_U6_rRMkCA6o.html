    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=25.625s">Welcome</a>  to the show Meeting Interested People. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=28.166s">Today</a>  my guest Louise Mastuchuat. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=32.227s">And</a>  I think if I just say Louise, everybody knows you. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=34.668s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=35.968s">Because</a>  you're involved in everywhere, like events around Medford, Circle the Square, Cachet. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=45.912s">By</a>  the way, what is Cachet?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=47.472s">CACHE</a>  means Coalition for Arts, Culture and a Healthy Economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=52.934s">So</a>  what that means is we want to take arts and culture and involve the businesses throughout the city to recognize and appreciate it and help us put that forth to the entire city.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=66.318s">Okay,</a>  so Louise and I, we met when I was taking her class, when she was teaching PMC, pure metal clay, jewelry. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=76.085s">Unfortunately,</a>  the gallery does not exist anymore, where the classes were held. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=82.23s">Hopefully,</a>  some people in Medford City Hall will listen to us and give us the opportunity to show how many talented people live in town, in the city, that they can show <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=95.415s">tremendous</a>  amount of artwork.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=98.677s">Well,</a>  I'd like to tell you about that because it will be in the Medford transcript today, so I won't be giving away secrets. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=106.04s">There</a>  is a group of us, and we are calling for Arts Collaborative Medford, and we are looking for a home for arts and culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=117.166s">We've</a>  been working on this <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=119.727s">Well,</a>  I've been working on it for a few years with a couple of city councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=125.589s">And</a>  now we have a group that, with like minds, are going to try to work on this and be fundraising and awareness and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=138.193s">It'll</a>  probably take a while, but I think we'll do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=141.153s">We're</a>  very determined to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=142.794s">So</a>  I'm very excited about this.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=145.195s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=147.176s">The</a>  dream will come true. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=148.498s">Yes,</a>  it will. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=150.56s">And</a>  so this is new, a media you started working with. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=154.705s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=155.446s">And</a>  tell us about why, how you came upon this particular... Okay.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=162.114s">Well,</a>  first let me say that, like you say, I did precious metal clay. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=172.121s">I</a>  bought, made it, sold it, taught classes in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=176.764s">And</a>  you get to a point where people say, do you do anything else? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=182.848s">And</a>  I thought, well, yeah, I do a lot of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=184.77s">I</a>  volunteer. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=185.571s">I</a>  belong to this organization, that organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=188.493s">But</a>  they seem to want more from me for some reason, like that wasn't enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=192.977s">So</a>  all of a sudden, I'm a YouTuber. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=196.6s">So</a>  I learned most of my precious clay metal jewelry from YouTube videos. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=202.845s">DVDs</a>  and so I went on YouTube and I thought I'd like to start doing things with mixed media like in painting and colors and learning about textures. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=216.189s">So</a>  I started this journal and I learned about different kinds of molding paste, using sand, using objects, different kind of paints, sprays, watercolors. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=228.833s">So</a>  I made like a journal. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=230.793s">And</a>  then one day when I was on YouTube, I saw this acrylic abstract painting and I always thought, oh, I can't paint or draw or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=242.845s">And</a>  people would say to me, you're so creative. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=245.127s">Don't</a>  you draw? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=246.088s">Don't</a>  you paint? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=248.23s">And</a>  I'd say, no, I can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=250.412s">So</a>  I came across <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=253.615s">this</a>  YouTube video that talked about accidental painting. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=259.798s">And</a>  I said probably everything I do is going to be an accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=264.96s">So</a>  it was discovered back in the 1930s by a very famous painter who <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=271.563s">I</a>  don't remember his name, but he's in every gallery worldwide and he's in MoMA in New York and whatever and he stumbled upon it when he decided to mix paints together instead of doing it with a brush. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=288.147s">and</a>  he poured it on the canvas and he tilted it and he added things to it and It was beautiful and people loved it and said oh, I like your new work He didn't think it was his new work. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=299.417s">He</a>  thought it was his work.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=300.678s">Mm-hmm.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=301.619s">So</a>  I Delved into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=304.802s">I</a>  had I bought a lot of things about tons of paint about you need to have pouring mediums you need to <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=312.338s">learn</a>  all about density and opacity of paints, which I never knew before. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=319.64s">And</a>  then it's all trial and error. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=322.021s">And</a>  so I started buying canvases, some inexpensive because I felt like they were going to be flops. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=330.264s">And</a>  the first few I did were unrecognizable. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=334.565s">All</a>  the paint muddled together and I had brown and orange and I did not intend to have those colors. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=341.327s">So,</a>  I belong to Danvers Art Association in Danvers. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=345.591s">It's</a>  a great organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=348.373s">It's</a>  about 100 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=350.575s">And</a>  they acquired a beautiful schoolhouse from the town, and they just maintain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=355.799s">They</a>  raise all their money through shows and the auction once a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=360.302s">They</a>  raise enough to heat the building, electricity, and just keep it going. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=365.566s">And</a>  so a friend of mine who is a member, <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=369.049s">He</a>  said to me, why don't you join? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=371.911s">So</a>  I joined. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=373.652s">And</a>  the first time I did anything was the Christmas fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=377.975s">And</a>  I actually had my jewelry and some crocheted items. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=383.539s">And</a>  so then comes along the spring show. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=388.163s">I</a>  did the jewelry again. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=390.344s">Came</a>  the fall show. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=392.426s">And</a>  all of a sudden, it's a jewelry art show. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=396.497s">So</a>  I said, I'd love to put something up on the wall just to get people's impression actually of my artwork to see if I have any talent. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=409.746s">And</a>  I could walk around the room during this show as a member and listen to people talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=416.05s">And</a>  I heard some really good comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=418.271s">So</a>  I should have probably taken this one out first. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=422.134s">So</a>  this actually is the one <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=425.847s">that</a>  I submitted amongst the others. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=428.327s">Oh,</a>  that's pretty. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=429.468s">And</a>  I won third place ribbon. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=432.888s">And</a>  as I walked around that night of the show, I said, oh, this one won a ribbon, that one won a ribbon. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=442.91s">And</a>  I was called into the other room and said, look who else won a ribbon. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=447.651s">And</a>  my friend, who had introduced me to Danvers Art Association, Bob Marcellino, who you know, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=455.352s">had</a>  won a beautiful ribbon like first place or second place. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=459.216s">And</a>  then he said, no, no, no, not me. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=461.377s">And</a>  he brought me over to my painting. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=463.759s">I</a>  saw that ribbon and I can't tell you, I mean, I was screaming, I won a ribbon, I won a ribbon. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=471.866s">And</a>  so, <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=473.547s">And</a>  everybody was like, okay, we know now because we hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=478.23s">And</a>  so very probably some of my favorite colors are in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=484.613s">The</a>  teal I really love. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=486.194s">And</a>  so I use <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=488.235s">very</a>  different techniques and that's why I brought different ones to show you techniques. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=493.337s">So</a>  we'll talk about this one, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=494.697s">This</a>  is called the tree ring. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=496.958s">And</a>  so what I do with this, several things actually, it's a pour and a tree ring. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=503.12s">So</a>  what I did with this was I knew the colors I wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=507.201s">This</a>  basically came the way I wanted it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=509.161s">It</a>  very rarely does. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=511.142s">And</a>  I layered the colors into a cup. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=514.163s">I</a>  had to mix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=514.983s">You</a>  have to mix it to a certain <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=517.991s">pouring</a>  consistency so that some of the paints that are opaque will go to the bottom of the cup and then the others will sit on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=530.253s">and</a>  others will pour through it, depending on what you want the outcome to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=535.015s">So</a>  this, called the tree ring, you basically fill your cup. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=538.196s">Yeah,</a>  you can see the... Right. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=539.877s">You</a>  basically fill your cup, but I didn't just want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=542.518s">There</a>  are some that are just a whole circle and they just keep going around and around, and they're lovely, but I kind of wanted this to go over. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=549.821s">So</a>  when I did that, I held the cup, and you have to hold your head steady. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=555.124s">and</a>  go in a little tight little circle, tight little circle, tight little circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=559.668s">And</a>  you can see these are so much closer than this part. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=564.032s">And</a>  then I decided, well, what would happen if I let go a little bit and go a little bit wider and a little bit wider and a little bit wider? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=571.038s">And</a>  then I left it there because the next thing in the cup was going to be white. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=575.782s">I</a>  really didn't want white in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=578.063s">So</a>  I just pulled the cup up and I poured the rest of it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=582.406s">So</a>  then you see, very different. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=584.708s">And</a>  I got a few little planets going on there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=587.911s">Right,</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=588.411s">And</a>  cells. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=589.512s">So</a>  everybody who does this type of abstract painting complains, I don't get any cells. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=597.157s">Some</a>  of the things you can put in there are silicone, treadmill oils, alcohol, different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=606.059s">So</a>  it's canvas.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=607.099s">It's</a>  on canvas.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=607.639s">This</a>  is on canvas, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=609.24s">I</a>  work on canvas. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=610.58s">I'll</a>  talk more about other substrates. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=614.081s">So</a>  this is on canvas. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=615.381s">So</a>  what year is that you did? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=617.342s">I</a>  did this last year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=619.782s">I</a>  started June...</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=624.283s">2017.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=624.423s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=625.864s">And</a>  in the fall, I want my first ribbon. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=628.004s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=628.685s">I</a>  frame some of my things. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=630.585s">Yeah,</a>  it's interesting.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=631.325s">It's</a>  like a box thing, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=632.906s">Yeah,</a>  it's actually sort of like a shadow box, but it doesn't, you know, it has the painting be able to come out a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=643.009s">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=643.629s">And</a>  it really frames it well. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=645.07s">These</a>  are my favorite types of frames.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=647.511s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=648.211s">And</a>  then you have to put it all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=650.011s">It's</a>  wood, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=650.672s">No,</a>  it's wooden. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=651.832s">So</a>  it takes some drilling and you get acquainted with your electric drill again. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=659.394s">And</a>  so from here, there were two other paintings that I had put in for the juried show, and the other two people liked better than this, and some said, no, this was interesting, but the others were very different. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=677.72s">And</a>  so, <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=679.2s">It</a>  encouraged me to just keep on going. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=683.723s">I</a>  just kept on going and so then... You want me to put this back? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=689.186s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=689.666s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=690.707s">So</a>  this past, was it November, we did the Beebe Estate Artisanal Ladies. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=700.592s">There</a>  were 10 of us there. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=702.808s">and</a>  all different types of mediums. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=706.472s">There</a>  was painting, photography, a lot of fiber arts, beautiful jewelry, and then some things like some holistic renderings and music to go with them and beautiful candles that people made. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=724.032s">A</a>  very interesting show. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=725.333s">It</a>  was probably one of the nicest shows that I've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=728.634s">So</a>  this is running every year, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=730.715s">Every</a>  year we have done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=733.236s">The</a>  BB Estate has once a month for each type of shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=739.74s">And</a>  so this was my third Artisanal Ladies. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=745.302s">it</a>  is all filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=746.063s">We</a>  need to tell our viewers that's Melrose. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=748.624s">I'm</a>  sorry yeah so that's held in the BB Estate in Melrose which is a lovely little old house. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=755.048s">A</a>  lot of character, a lot of architecture and so you think you're visiting somebody's home that has beautiful artwork in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=764.233s">And</a>  so, yeah, we'd like more of that in Medford, I'll tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=770.317s">And</a>  I know Mackie has been doing some wonderful new things with art and inviting artists to show their work and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=780.365s">But</a>  I would like to see a lot more, a lot more venues. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=784.287s">So,</a>  I continued and I needed to have paintings to put up on the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=791.012s">I</a>  had a few, but not anything substantial. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=794.353s">So</a>  after the Danvers show, I started really painting a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=801.035s">This</a>  is one of my favorites. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=803.276s">And</a>  as you see, almost the same colors as the first one. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=807.297s">And</a>  that's why I brought it, to show you that you can use almost the same color, except this is gold. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=814.14s">Yeah,</a>  there was an orangey gold, and black, and teal, which I love, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=821.122s">So</a>  it's the same cop, different layers. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=825.164s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=825.744s">So</a>  what I did know, so on this one, I actually, and you could do it many ways, the way you like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=832.307s">I</a>  actually asked my Facebook friend <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=836.344s">art</a>  group, which way should I do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=839.786s">And</a>  we all agreed this was the way, but you can't change this. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=843.068s">So</a>  in this one, I actually just mixed the certain colors and I poured it over the canvas, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=850.952s">And</a>  in different shapes and sizes of thinness of it, thickness of the lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=859.537s">And</a>  then I took black and I swiped it with a piece of paper Oh, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=867.044s">And</a>  so you just swipe it and what happens is the black is opaque And the colors are not and I did their transport they call transparent So what I did with this one is I put a little bit of treadmill oil in the other colors aside from black so that when you <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=888.581s">when</a>  you take the paper or whatever object you want and go across the paint, then all of the oils will come out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=898.806s">Because</a>  the black is opaque, it has the paint peep through. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=904.129s">So</a>  then, that was okay, but it was black and teal. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=908.612s">And</a>  I'm starting to like gold a lot.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=910.533s">So</a>  you said you have a journal where you're writing all these experiments.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=915.777s">No,</a>  I'm not.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=917.018s">But</a>  you should, you know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=917.939s">I</a>  should be doing that because there are a lot of things I forget.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=921.962s">Yeah,</a>  because when I teach the silk painting, and I encourage students to experiment. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=930.908s">And</a>  then I said, don't forget to write. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=933.269s">What</a>  did you do in this particular one? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=935.891s">Because</a>  if you want to repeat, just pull the card or whatever, the notebook, and you found this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=943.595s">And</a>  of course, take a picture, put it next to it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=946.677s">And</a>  I did that when I was doing my journaling. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=950.159s">in</a>  my journal, and when I look back at it now, it was really quite awful and quite ugly. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=956.844s">And</a>  I really thought with each page I did I was getting better, but I wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=962.208s">But</a>  I feel now I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=963.549s">So</a>  what I did then was I took gold paint, I mixed it up, and I have some favorite paints. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=970.754s">This</a>  was not one of my favorite gold paints, but it worked well for this particular <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=977.279s">So</a>  then I thought, well what would happen if I put some gold on there and then swipe that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=983.364s">What</a>  I did was I used a palette knife this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=986.427s">So</a>  I could start and stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=987.969s">So</a>  I took the gold paint and I put it there and then I could start and stop it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=995.295s">So</a>  the canvas background was white. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=998.318s">This</a>  canvas was white. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1001.141s">I</a>  don't know if I brought you something that I poured colors. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1005.084s">But</a>  what you can do is what we call negative space. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1010.649s">So</a>  if I just want a little bit of color or a little bit of a design, I could pour white paint all over here and then mix up colors or place colors on the canvas. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1024.401s">That</a>  will just cover it a certain amount and leave that negative space. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1029.524s">Let</a>  me see what I did bring here Okay, see if I have anything like that So, of course, I didn't bring it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1036.869s">Oh,</a>  okay, but that's okay So we'll be showing your website where you have all the samples and or finished artwork Yeah, I do include the jewelry. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1048.216s">Also.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1048.656s">Oh,</a>  yes, my website actually has sections so that I have my <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1054.39s">abstract</a>  paintings and my jewelry by category. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1058.712s">So,</a>  you know, for everybody to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1061.293s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1061.753s">So</a>  then I would like to show you this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1065.334s">So</a>  that was a swipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1066.855s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1067.655s">And</a>  very, I mixed three different colors. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1072.817s">So</a>  this is also a swipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1077.861s">only</a>  use two again.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1079.582s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1079.962s">And</a>  actually it looks like teal but it's teal with every other a lot of other colors mixed in and there's gray. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1087.546s">Every</a>  now and then you can see the gray come through. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1090.868s">But</a>  I wanted this white to come just like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1094.27s">So</a>  after I poured it <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1095.991s">I</a>  just poured white or I placed it with my brush and I just put the white there. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1101.816s">And</a>  then I swipe this way and this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1104.778s">But</a>  what I used this time was a long spatula that you use for frosting a cake. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1111.183s">So</a>  you learn all these different ways to do things and they don't always come out as you plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1119.325s">Hence,</a>  accidental painting. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1123.626s">And</a>  what I like to do now is also, for people that would come to my shows and don't necessarily have wall space. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1136.74s">particularly</a>  want something this size for their wall, it's too big, it's too small, I have taken my art into tiles. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1147.603s">So</a>  I make coasters, which is all my original art, hot plates, and I just started making these beautiful boxes I call everything or anything box, which are rosewood boxes with a six by six tile, and all those tiles <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1166.902s">are</a>  not only hand painted, but I resin them so that they actually, like the coasters, can be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1174.873s">They're</a>  not just for ornamental purposes or, you know, decorative design. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1181.125s">And</a>  those were very well received at the BB show. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1186.088s">And</a>  I did sell some paintings there. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1188.99s">So</a>  for all intent and purposes, people say I can call myself an artist now, since I've won a ribbon and I sold some paintings. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1197.997s">So</a>  I'm feeling really good about it and really excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1202.4s">Oh,</a>  that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1204.081s">And</a>  there is one more piece I would like to show you, because when I mentioned the gold. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1208.564s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1209.204s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1211.338s">This</a>  is just one of my very favorites. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1216.841s">Not</a>  sure I'm going to be able to part with this one because I really love that gold. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1224.225s">And</a>  that gold is made by Winsor & Newton. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1227.928s">Much</a>  more expensive paints that come in a tube. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1233.631s">that</a>  are very thick.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1234.452s">And</a>  I like how you made this here right around too. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1236.814s">Oh,</a>  all the way around.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1238.215s">Well,</a>  I try to do that and make it be interesting.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1240.978s">Yeah,</a>  yeah, yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1242.239s">And</a>  I actually use my fingers to do that with. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1245.261s">Thank</a>  you for noticing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1246.462s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1246.903s">So</a>  this I really love. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1248.284s">And</a>  I've gotten some really good feedback on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1255.51s">So</a>  I actually <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1257.952s">decided</a>  that I would do more, a little more in the gold. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1260.434s">I</a>  think if you will be doing bigger frame and push this little forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1266.279s">Yeah,</a>  I can do that because I do have some frames, and they do sell them, that are called float frames. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1274.886s">Not</a>  floating frames, but float frames. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1277.748s">So</a>  that mostly a lot, well half of this would stick out from the frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1283.213s">And</a>  it's very gallery worthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1284.934s">This</a>  is <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1285.955s">what</a>  they call a gallery wrapped level three canvas. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1290.216s">So</a>  the price for this in selling is much higher than one that is seven eighths of an inch level one gallery. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1303.801s">But</a>  it all depends what somebody wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1306.902s">And</a>  so what I'm going for is what intrigues me, what comes out of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1312.163s">When</a>  I look at the canvas, <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1314.304s">I</a>  knew what I wanted to do with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1317.026s">I</a>  would say to incorporate red the way I wanted it to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1321.85s">I</a>  probably poured six. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1325.132s">That</a>  came up, just did not work. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1327.294s">They</a>  went into the black. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1330.517s">In</a>  fact, my daughter, my granddaughter, just moved to a new house, and she asked me for a red, a black, and a white painting, those three colors. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1344.367s">I've</a>  done two. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1346.028s">They</a>  came maroon and gray. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1348.409s">So</a>  back to the drawing board on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1350.47s">So</a>  it's a lot of experimenting, a lot of feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1355.732s">There's</a>  a lot, I think you commented on one of mine that they kind of look <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1363.415s">you</a>  know like they're part of celestial part of the sky. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1367.077s">So</a>  I'm trying to do a lot more of those.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1368.798s">Yeah</a>  it's like cosmic. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1370.419s">You</a>  can see it's from space. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1372.24s">Even</a>  the surface of planets. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1375.302s">It's</a>  pictures from NASA. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1376.763s">I'm</a>  trying to do that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1378.384s">So</a>  I'm practicing on some birch circles to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1382.827s">They're</a>  inexpensive and so I can practice on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1385.929s">And</a>  so this is canvas also? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1387.369s">This</a>  is canvas. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1388.29s">Did</a>  you try on the wood? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1390.111s">Yes,</a>  so I do have a wood panelist on my website and it's an 11 by 14 and it's called cradled because it's this thick on the sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1401.243s">It's</a>  that thick on the sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1406.148s">Yes,</a>  you have to prep it differently than you would a canvas. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1410.031s">I</a>  buy my canvases and they have three coats of gesso on it, which is a great primer, and it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1419.297s">I</a>  don't have to put any more on. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1421.498s">Wood,</a>  I do two or three coats. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1423.679s">I</a>  sand it in between so that you don't have that fuzz sticking up. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1429.16s">You</a>  still want the paint to adhere to the wood. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1432.581s">And</a>  so one I have on my website is called Running River, and it, to me, looks like the sand underneath the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1442.463s">the</a>  river flowing down. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1445.105s">I</a>  just finished a resin on a cradled wood which is an 8x8 and I did put it in a float frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1457.473s">and</a>  it kind of looks very cosmic. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1459.754s">I</a>  used all metallics, copper and gold and rose gold and on black, a black background on the wooden surface and mixed the resin with paints. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1475.839s">They're</a>  actually a powdered mica, a mica powder and <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1482.821s">Resin</a>  is a very tricky thing to do and it's very sticky if you don't mix it well. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1489.463s">I</a>  used it a lot with my tiles and it worked really well. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1494.145s">I</a>  didn't have a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1495.646s">Well,</a>  the first couple of times you do have a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1497.866s">You</a>  have to get used to mixing it well and pouring it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1502.488s">It's</a>  very different on paintings when you're using different types of paints acrylics or powders So some of the powders if you don't mix them well enough will clump In the resin and then you've just ruined something and it's very expensive to use resin But the one I did I love it really came out very you probably can do this on Glass I have poured on glass. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1530.475s">I</a>  have two one <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1532.415s">One</a>  is called The Monster, and I did put black on the background, and shades of browns, beige, and gold, and I think a little copper in there, with a negative space. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1547.264s">And</a>  it did not come out as I planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1552.8s">It's</a>  not one of my favorites, but quite a few people love it because it's odd. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1558.222s">Well,</a>  everyone has different tastes. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1559.782s">Yeah,</a>  everybody does. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1561.823s">And</a>  it's interesting to me to say, oh, I don't like that one or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1568.885s">It's</a>  not what I wanted, but somebody else might want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1572.926s">But</a>  on the bottom side of anything, it comes from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1578.408s">It's</a>  mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1582.029s">I'm</a>  not happy with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1583.55s">It's</a>  very hard for me to present that to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1588.053s">But</a>  like you say, somebody else might like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1591.475s">But</a>  I'm very fussy. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1594.237s">And</a>  so I'll just do it over. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1596.179s">And</a>  that's the nicest thing about acrylic paint. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1598.38s">It's</a>  not like oils. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1599.921s">that</a>  I can actually prep the canvas again and pour over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1604.924s">I</a>  have quite a few I've done that with. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1606.985s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1607.705s">I've</a>  been so much happier.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1608.766s">Yeah,</a>  well it reminds me of this Japanese technique. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1611.808s">It's</a>  called Saminaguchi. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1613.368s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1613.709s">That's</a>  when you put the ink in the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1616.81s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1617.23s">And</a>  then you're doing whatever and then you put over the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1620.372s">The</a>  paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1621.013s">And</a>  then pull it out and it could be abstract whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1624.755s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1625.835s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1626.536s">Part</a>  of the challenge to some of these are, if you, and I didn't bring one like that, if you just did what they call, you can do a flip cup or a poured cup, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1644.267s">And</a>  the difference being, once you level your paint, you could take, by the way, you could take two containers and fill them exactly the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1654.794s">And</a>  then pour them on the canvas and you wouldn't recognize one from the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1658.936s">They</a>  don't look anything alike. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1660.977s">So</a>  you have to master. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1662.538s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1663.419s">You</a>  have to master manipulation of that once it hits the canvas. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1667.461s">And</a>  that's a challenge all the time because usually you love what comes out of the cup. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1672.484s">It's</a>  like, oh, this is gorgeous. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1674.625s">If</a>  it stayed that way, this big, you would love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1678.387s">Once</a>  you move it, you sometimes have to tilt it so that you lose the best part. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1684.85s">or</a>  you have too much of one color and you're trying to get rid of it and when you do that the other side comes out like just blah and so that's a repour. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1696.254s">Are</a>  you planning to teach? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1697.315s">I</a>  would love to. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1699.716s">When</a>  I feel that I know it well enough to explain it <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1704.017s">yeah</a>  well to people um a lot of people on my facebook groups are doing that now and it's so exciting however um when people don't make a nice painting they're kind of upset and so uh i you know just like when i taught jewelry i never had a <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1725.759s">of</a>  anybody who didn't like what they made at the end of the class. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1730.643s">So</a>  I would like to be able to get to a point. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1733.706s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1734.226s">You</a>  liked what you made? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1735.708s">No,</a>  that's what I meant to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1736.929s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1737.729s">Nobody</a>  ever complained that they didn't like what they made. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1741.613s">And</a>  I guess I hoped it was my teaching ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1745.476s">So</a>  I think I could teach. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1749.02s">I</a>  feel like I need more knowledge and experience myself before I could actually charge somebody.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1755.465s">Yeah,</a>  well tell all you is how you feel when you creating something?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1762.351s">Well,</a>  I have I actually Okay, and then don't mean to be you know in a sad frame of mind, but as you well know I had a health problem and <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1775.585s">And</a>  I just felt like, oh my God, I can't be me anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1782.368s">What</a>  am I gonna do? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1783.328s">I</a>  can't do the same things. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1785.129s">I</a>  can't, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1787.05s">And</a>  so I started looking into myself and I said, okay, so you can express yourself in a blue, low mood. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1798.235s">My</a>  life is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1800.766s">or</a>  you can do something about it, and I'm a fighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1804.669s">So</a>  that's when I started going on YouTube and said, okay, what can I do? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1810.034s">I</a>  physically can't do yoga anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1812.135s">I</a>  physically can't do a lot of things anymore, but there's things I can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1816.259s">That</a>  used my mind and thought about my jewelry and <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1820.954s">what</a>  I called the designs in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1823.657s">Then</a>  I thought well I might have other designs in my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1826.58s">Of</a>  course. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1827.361s">And</a>  so I went on YouTube like I said just looking and looking and I started. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1832.707s">I</a>  started journaling, I started learning about things, I started to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1838.353s">But</a>  let's go roll back. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1840.495s">The</a>  PMC, how that start? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1843.563s">That</a>  started, well let's see, I was beading, I started beading in about 2000 and just for myself to make jewelry. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1852.509s">And</a>  just because you retired about that time? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1854.35s">No,</a>  no, I was still working. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1855.611s">Oh,</a>  you're still working. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1856.472s">I</a>  was still working, I was working in a pharmaceutical company actually right here in Medford and I wore a bracelet to work one day and I was doing crystals at that time and one of the girls said, <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1869.24s">That's</a>  beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1870.021s">Where</a>  did you get it? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1871.603s">I</a>  made it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1872.584s">Can</a>  you make me one? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1874.026s">Started.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1874.867s">Every</a>  time I wore a piece of jewelry, this one girl, Jennifer, her name is, would buy something for me or order something special in colors. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1883.517s">So</a>  everybody in the office kind of said, wow, where'd you get that? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1888.523s">So</a>  I started making a lot of beaded things, mostly crystals and very light types of things and I found out about West Medford Open Studios. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1900.356s">Somebody</a>  said to me, you should sell your jewelry there, it's beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1904.52s">So</a>  I applied and I got accepted and the very first year <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1910.627s">I</a>  was in a house on the second floor, and I forget the name of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1917.833s">A</a>  lovely woman and her two daughters welcomed me and told me, you can use my dining room table. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1925.018s">They</a>  had already put a cloth for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1927.48s">And</a>  I started to put my jewelry up and they're like, don't you have any prices? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1933.842s">And</a>  I said, oh, you mean people are going to buy it? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1936.143s">I</a>  thought it was just like to meet the artist and talk about it, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1941.204s">And</a>  they said, oh no, people buy things. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1943.625s">So</a>  I quickly took pieces of paper and wrote prices. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1947.686s">I</a>  didn't have business cards, I didn't have anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1950.848s">And</a>  at the end of the day, I mean, people were, wow, those colors, they're beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1959.801s">What</a>  made you put those together? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1961.824s">And</a>  I was so happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1963.426s">I</a>  sold quite a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1966.11s">And</a>  I went home, and I called my best friend, and I said, they liked me. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1970.554s">They</a>  really liked me. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1972.356s">And</a>  she said, OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1974.157s">I</a>  went back the next day, and almost closing, a woman came rushing into me and said, I have this top. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1981.263s">My</a>  son's getting married in three weeks in New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1983.645s">Can</a>  you make me something to go with this? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1985.987s">I'm</a>  like, you're kidding, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1987.628s">I</a>  had never made a commissioned piece, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1991.05s">She</a>  actually gave me some of her grandmother's beads. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=1995.612s">I</a>  made three different pieces using some of hers and some of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2000.275s">She</a>  let me keep the top to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2003.557s">And</a>  she came to my house two days before leaving from New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2009.12s">bought</a>  the piece to match her top, and bought the other two pieces to give as gifts to the bridesmaids. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2016.543s">So</a>  I was like, okay, I'm doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2019.724s">So</a>  I beaded for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2022.545s">And</a>  then I just sort of said, I'm kind of running out of ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2026.747s">So</a>  I went to the bead shop in Lexington, where I bought most of my beads when not online. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2035.262s">And</a>  they were offering these classes and I saw this beautiful silver jewelry and it said, this is a lump of clay that makes this beautiful jewelry and it was a picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2050.388s">And</a>  I said, oh my God, I have to learn how to do this now. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2054.109s">Took</a>  one class. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2056.15s">made</a>  a really nice piece, which I sold recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2059.091s">I</a>  hadn't put it out for a while because that was my first one, but I did sell it recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2064.053s">And</a>  went home, bought books, DVDs, YouTube, and whatever, and I went into business. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2071.617s">That</a>  was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2072.837s">So</a>  that year when I did West Medford Open Studios, I did some and some. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2076.959s">Some</a>  beaded, some silver. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2079.28s">What</a>  year is that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2080.762s">That</a>  was 2010.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2081.644s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2081.924s">So</a>  yeah, 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2091.902s">A</a>  woman came to me and said, oh, is this metal clay? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2095.884s">I</a>  said, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2097.224s">She</a>  said, oh, I took this class. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2099.845s">I</a>  lived in California, and they're so advanced, there's none here. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2104.887s">Nobody</a>  I know makes this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2107.688s">I</a>  went to intensive, month-long <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2112.014s">classes</a>  and nothing I made came out good. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2116.398s">So</a>  she said, would you be willing to teach me? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2119.02s">And</a>  I thought, oh my God, I've never taught this. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2122.043s">Like</a>  you're saying to me, can I teach? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2124.765s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2125.446s">I</a>  know my stuff, but can I teach? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2127.968s">But</a>  did I know my stuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2129.249s">I</a>  just started. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2133.613s">Marika,</a>  she's a very lovely girl, and another woman at that time that I knew was a beater, was interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2140.501s">So</a>  I had my first class in my living room, and she loved what she made. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2147.068s">She's</a>  taken, oh, maybe six or seven classes from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2153.174s">So</a>  after the Mystic Art Gallery closed and I stopped doing the classes there, I turned my spare room into a workshop and bought all kinds of things so that I could continue to teach. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2167.391s">And</a>  I taught quite a few classes still. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2170.874s">just</a>  stopped when I started painting, but now I've had three requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2175.717s">When</a>  are you going to do the next class? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2178.238s">So</a>  I'm thinking I'm going to have March and April free because I didn't mention to you starting the beginning of March <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2187.842s">My</a>  artwork is going to be in the new gallery at the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2192.824s">Oh,</a>  yeah, yeah, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2193.944s">So</a>  they opened it last fall and I've been asked to... Is that only just for show or sale also? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2201.766s">Also,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2203.587s">I</a>  am planning to have a reception. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2205.527s">I</a>  don't have a date yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2207.088s">I</a>  need to talk to the powers that be.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2210.709s">And</a>  then... I think another option is multicultural center in Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2215.569s">You</a>  should apply for that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2216.69s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2217.51s">Kaiserschule</a>  exhibit will be there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2219.551s">Oh,</a>  nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2221.712s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2222.352s">And</a>  then I'm doing the Mellows Arts Festival the end of April. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2226.094s">Again,</a>  at Memorial Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2228.235s">It's</a>  a great take. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2230.236s">I</a>  know you've been there visiting me many times, but I'll be doing my artwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2234.838s">And</a>  then in May, I'll be at Mr. Coffee Roasters on the walls where you can have your coffee. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2241.521s">You</a>  can see my artwork there. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2244.262s">And</a>  so I feel brave that I ventured out and have actually applied and asked people and they like it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2252.406s">Well</a>  I'm your admirer and I like people who are creating. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2257.388s">But</a>  let's go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2258.469s">So</a>  it didn't start from nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2260.75s">Obviously</a>  your parents</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2264.092s">No,</a>  I'll tell you where it started. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2265.973s">When</a>  you have children and you get involved in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2270.116s">So</a>  we had a very small grammar school up by Tufts and I lived on the hillside of Medford for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2279.503s">And</a>  so my children went to the school there and the teachers actually didn't have budgets for books and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2289.448s">So</a>  my daughter read at home when she was four and she went to first grade and these books were 12 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2299.794s">But</a>  by law in Massachusetts the books can be no older than six years old in the new writings, the new editions in other words. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2308.92s">So</a>  they were reading books that probably I had when I was a kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2313.043s">So</a>  the teacher said, we have no money. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2316.305s">So</a>  I said, how about if we run a fair? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2318.487s">Well,</a>  I had never done that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2321.861s">I</a>  masterminded this thing and got some parents together. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2325.982s">We</a>  actually formed a group called TAP, Teachers and Parents, instead of PTA that we didn't have to pay to register. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2333.184s">So</a>  I decided we needed a big raffle item. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2336.725s">And</a>  then we had like Christmas, it was gonna be a Christmas fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2339.885s">We</a>  were gonna make all these lovely little Christmas things. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2342.926s">So</a>  quilts, never made a quilt either. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2345.627s">So</a>  I looked up some designs that were easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2348.888s">I</a>  drew one out. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2350.91s">picked</a>  the colors, gave each of the women the colors and the design to put together, so sewing a whole strip. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2359.557s">We</a>  did strips each and then we sat and put it all together into the backing, like a little sewing bee, quilting bee, and we raffled that off. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2370.085s">and</a>  the money we made between the raffling of the quilt and all of the Christmas table that we did, we made enough money to buy books for the first and second grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2384.652s">However,</a>  the school system would not let us <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2389.255s">give</a>  the money to the teachers to buy the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2392.478s">It</a>  was against the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2393.879s">So</a>  we went and bought the books and we brought them to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2396.801s">I</a>  had them delivered to the school from us, a gift. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2400.405s">And</a>  the teachers were just like overwhelmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2403.728s">So</a>  then people <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2405.409s">So</a>  it continued for a while because people that saw the things I made during that Christmas fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2411.953s">I</a>  made holly hobby dolls, tooth fairy pillows, kinds of things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2417.077s">Oh,</a>  Della Robbia wreaths and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2419.758s">So</a>  I kind of started a little business on the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2422.52s">Yeah,</a>  but where did you learn that? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2424.181s">I</a>  just taught myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2425.722s">Oh,</a>  self-teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2427.683s">Yeah,</a>  my mother was very good at embroidering. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2431.987s">So</a>  maybe, you're making me think way back now. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2435.17s">My</a>  father was a custom upholsterer, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2438.453s">So</a>  my father could make a chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2441.716s">You</a>  gave him the fabric. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2443.938s">So</a>  the arm here and the arm here had the same exact flower on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2449.263s">He</a>  matched everything perfectly, every stripe. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2453.528s">And</a>  when he used to work in our basement two nights a week on his own from his regular job, he would let me make buttons. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2462.755s">see</a>  now you're making me think where this came from and so there was this little machine and you cut out the fabric and you put a little cotton and then there was a metal bottom and then a top and it was like a press and he was having me make all these beautiful buttons and I would be so proud to say I made the sofa. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2483.531s">you</a>  know, hit all the buttons. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2485.192s">So</a>  I guess that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2486.774s">My</a>  mother, great embroidery, ton of patience with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2492.238s">And</a>  then later on, when she would see me do things, I started making pillows to match like people's bedroom sets and added silk flowers to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2503.747s">So</a>  she started to do some of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2504.968s">But</a>  the flowers, you didn't make it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2506.469s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2506.689s">No,</a>  I just bought the flowers. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2508.691s">No,</a>  I just bought it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2510.392s">all,</a>  but the fabric and the matching and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2513.454s">And</a>  so she started to do that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2515.215s">So,</a>  you know, I guess... So what about your children? <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2519.657s">The</a>  son is a filmmaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2520.578s">The</a>  oldest son is a filmmaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2521.578s">I</a>  have one son who's a filmmaker and photographer and a musician. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2528.442s">He</a>  plays several instruments. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2530.583s">He</a>  plays bass and guitar. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2531.644s">He</a>  has a famous movie. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2533.064s">He</a>  has two movies. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2534.865s">One's</a>  called May I Be Frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2537.247s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2537.847s">Great</a>  movie. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2538.727s">It's</a>  still going around the world as far as Australia now. <a href="https://youtu.be/U6_rRMkCA6o&t=2543.97s">And</a>  his other film was called Love Bomb, which was another fabulous movie about service and helping people.</p>
