1
00:00:02,413 --> 00:00:02,514
do

2
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,946
Welcome to the show Meeting Interested People.

3
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,567
Today my guest Louise Mastuchuat.

4
00:00:32,227 --> 00:00:34,628
And I think if I just say Louise, everybody knows you.

5
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:35,168
Absolutely.

6
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:45,872
Because you're involved in everywhere, like events around Medford, Circle the Square, Cachet.

7
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:46,872
By the way, what is Cachet?

8
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:52,094
CACHE means Coalition for Arts, Culture and a Healthy Economy.

9
00:00:52,934 --> 00:01:05,818
So what that means is we want to take arts and culture and involve the businesses throughout the city to recognize and appreciate it and help us put that forth to the entire city.

10
00:01:06,318 --> 00:01:15,905
Okay, so Louise and I, we met when I was taking her class, when she was teaching PMC, pure metal clay, jewelry.

11
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:20,749
Unfortunately, the gallery does not exist anymore, where the classes were held.

12
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:34,600
Hopefully, some people in Medford City Hall will listen to us and give us the opportunity to show how many talented people live in town, in the city, that they can show

13
00:01:35,415 --> 00:01:37,396
tremendous amount of artwork.

14
00:01:38,677 --> 00:01:44,980
Well, I'd like to tell you about that because it will be in the Medford transcript today, so I won't be giving away secrets.

15
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:56,726
There is a group of us, and we are calling for Arts Collaborative Medford, and we are looking for a home for arts and culture.

16
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,386
We've been working on this

17
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:04,729
Well, I've been working on it for a few years with a couple of city councilors.

18
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:18,153
And now we have a group that, with like minds, are going to try to work on this and be fundraising and awareness and whatever.

19
00:02:18,193 --> 00:02:20,833
It'll probably take a while, but I think we'll do it.

20
00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:22,714
We're very determined to do it.

21
00:02:22,794 --> 00:02:24,574
So I'm very excited about this.

22
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:25,815
All right.

23
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:28,277
The dream will come true.

24
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:29,859
Yes, it will.

25
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,225
And so this is new, a media you started working with.

26
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:34,966
Right.

27
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:41,033
And tell us about why, how you came upon this particular... Okay.

28
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:50,700
Well, first let me say that, like you say, I did precious metal clay.

29
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:55,583
I bought, made it, sold it, taught classes in it.

30
00:02:56,764 --> 00:03:01,007
And you get to a point where people say, do you do anything else?

31
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:04,690
And I thought, well, yeah, I do a lot of things.

32
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,531
I volunteer.

33
00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:08,473
I belong to this organization, that organization.

34
00:03:08,493 --> 00:03:12,516
But they seem to want more from me for some reason, like that wasn't enough.

35
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:16,260
So all of a sudden, I'm a YouTuber.

36
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,145
So I learned most of my precious clay metal jewelry from YouTube videos.

37
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:35,809
DVDs and so I went on YouTube and I thought I'd like to start doing things with mixed media like in painting and colors and learning about textures.

38
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:48,773
So I started this journal and I learned about different kinds of molding paste, using sand, using objects, different kind of paints, sprays, watercolors.

39
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,013
So I made like a journal.

40
00:03:50,793 --> 00:04:02,505
And then one day when I was on YouTube, I saw this acrylic abstract painting and I always thought, oh, I can't paint or draw or anything.

41
00:04:02,845 --> 00:04:04,887
And people would say to me, you're so creative.

42
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:06,008
Don't you draw?

43
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:07,730
Don't you paint?

44
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,491
And I'd say, no, I can't.

45
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:11,834
So I came across

46
00:04:13,615 --> 00:04:19,278
this YouTube video that talked about accidental painting.

47
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,820
And I said probably everything I do is going to be an accident.

48
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,823
So it was discovered back in the 1930s by a very famous painter who

49
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:46,222
I don't remember his name, but he's in every gallery worldwide and he's in MoMA in New York and whatever and he stumbled upon it when he decided to mix paints together instead of doing it with a brush.

50
00:04:48,147 --> 00:04:59,377
and he poured it on the canvas and he tilted it and he added things to it and It was beautiful and people loved it and said oh, I like your new work He didn't think it was his new work.

51
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:00,418
He thought it was his work.

52
00:05:00,678 --> 00:05:00,938
Mm-hmm.

53
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:03,801
So I Delved into it.

54
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:11,428
I had I bought a lot of things about tons of paint about you need to have pouring mediums you need to

55
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:18,120
learn all about density and opacity of paints, which I never knew before.

56
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,001
And then it's all trial and error.

57
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:28,803
And so I started buying canvases, some inexpensive because I felt like they were going to be flops.

58
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:34,425
And the first few I did were unrecognizable.

59
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:40,407
All the paint muddled together and I had brown and orange and I did not intend to have those colors.

60
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:45,551
So, I belong to Danvers Art Association in Danvers.

61
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:48,093
It's a great organization.

62
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:49,834
It's about 100 years old.

63
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:55,699
And they acquired a beautiful schoolhouse from the town, and they just maintain it.

64
00:05:55,799 --> 00:06:00,222
They raise all their money through shows and the auction once a year.

65
00:06:00,302 --> 00:06:04,626
They raise enough to heat the building, electricity, and just keep it going.

66
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:08,308
And so a friend of mine who is a member,

67
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:11,311
He said to me, why don't you join?

68
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:12,692
So I joined.

69
00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:17,475
And the first time I did anything was the Christmas fair.

70
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:22,539
And I actually had my jewelry and some crocheted items.

71
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:27,462
And so then comes along the spring show.

72
00:06:28,163 --> 00:06:29,263
I did the jewelry again.

73
00:06:30,344 --> 00:06:31,365
Came the fall show.

74
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,847
And all of a sudden, it's a jewelry art show.

75
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:49,406
So I said, I'd love to put something up on the wall just to get people's impression actually of my artwork to see if I have any talent.

76
00:06:49,746 --> 00:06:55,429
And I could walk around the room during this show as a member and listen to people talking.

77
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,711
And I heard some really good comments.

78
00:06:58,271 --> 00:07:01,233
So I should have probably taken this one out first.

79
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:04,796
So this actually is the one

80
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:08,067
that I submitted amongst the others.

81
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,128
Oh, that's pretty.

82
00:07:09,468 --> 00:07:12,068
And I won third place ribbon.

83
00:07:12,888 --> 00:07:22,170
And as I walked around that night of the show, I said, oh, this one won a ribbon, that one won a ribbon.

84
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,311
And I was called into the other room and said, look who else won a ribbon.

85
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:33,952
And my friend, who had introduced me to Danvers Art Association, Bob Marcellino, who you know, I think.

86
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:38,615
had won a beautiful ribbon like first place or second place.

87
00:07:39,216 --> 00:07:40,997
And then he said, no, no, no, not me.

88
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,739
And he brought me over to my painting.

89
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:51,606
I saw that ribbon and I can't tell you, I mean, I was screaming, I won a ribbon, I won a ribbon.

90
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:52,327
And so,

91
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:57,249
And everybody was like, okay, we know now because we hear it.

92
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:04,213
And so very probably some of my favorite colors are in there.

93
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:06,074
The teal I really love.

94
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,815
And so I use

95
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:13,297
very different techniques and that's why I brought different ones to show you techniques.

96
00:08:13,337 --> 00:08:14,457
So we'll talk about this one, yeah.

97
00:08:14,697 --> 00:08:15,977
This is called the tree ring.

98
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:22,599
And so what I do with this, several things actually, it's a pour and a tree ring.

99
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,701
So what I did with this was I knew the colors I wanted.

100
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:29,141
This basically came the way I wanted it.

101
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:30,422
It very rarely does.

102
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:33,763
And I layered the colors into a cup.

103
00:08:34,163 --> 00:08:34,943
I had to mix it.

104
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:36,464
You have to mix it to a certain

105
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:49,152
pouring consistency so that some of the paints that are opaque will go to the bottom of the cup and then the others will sit on it.

106
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:54,455
and others will pour through it, depending on what you want the outcome to be.

107
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:58,176
So this, called the tree ring, you basically fill your cup.

108
00:08:58,196 --> 00:08:59,557
Yeah, you can see the... Right.

109
00:08:59,877 --> 00:09:02,198
You basically fill your cup, but I didn't just want it.

110
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:09,201
There are some that are just a whole circle and they just keep going around and around, and they're lovely, but I kind of wanted this to go over.

111
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:13,783
So when I did that, I held the cup, and you have to hold your head steady.

112
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:19,307
and go in a little tight little circle, tight little circle, tight little circle.

113
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:23,691
And you can see these are so much closer than this part.

114
00:09:24,032 --> 00:09:30,698
And then I decided, well, what would happen if I let go a little bit and go a little bit wider and a little bit wider and a little bit wider?

115
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:35,161
And then I left it there because the next thing in the cup was going to be white.

116
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:37,623
I really didn't want white in the middle.

117
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:41,866
So I just pulled the cup up and I poured the rest of it here.

118
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:44,408
So then you see, very different.

119
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,810
And I got a few little planets going on there.

120
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:48,371
Right, right.

121
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:49,051
And cells.

122
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:56,417
So everybody who does this type of abstract painting complains, I don't get any cells.

123
00:09:57,157 --> 00:10:06,039
Some of the things you can put in there are silicone, treadmill oils, alcohol, different things.

124
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:06,779
So it's canvas.

125
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:07,619
It's on canvas.

126
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,180
This is on canvas, yeah.

127
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,520
I work on canvas.

128
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,021
I'll talk more about other substrates.

129
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,321
So this is on canvas.

130
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,881
So what year is that you did?

131
00:10:17,342 --> 00:10:19,742
I did this last year.

132
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:19,742
2017.

133
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:20,182
I started June...

134
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:25,724
2017.

135
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,724
Okay.

136
00:10:25,864 --> 00:10:27,944
And in the fall, I want my first ribbon.

137
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:28,364
Yeah.

138
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:30,445
I frame some of my things.

139
00:10:30,585 --> 00:10:31,305
Yeah, it's interesting.

140
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:32,846
It's like a box thing, right?

141
00:10:32,906 --> 00:10:42,889
Yeah, it's actually sort of like a shadow box, but it doesn't, you know, it has the painting be able to come out a little bit.

142
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:43,569
Right, right.

143
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:45,010
And it really frames it well.

144
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,191
These are my favorite types of frames.

145
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:48,111
Okay.

146
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:49,931
And then you have to put it all together.

147
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:50,512
It's wood, right?

148
00:10:50,672 --> 00:10:51,312
No, it's wooden.

149
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:58,794
So it takes some drilling and you get acquainted with your electric drill again.

150
00:10:59,394 --> 00:11:17,019
And so from here, there were two other paintings that I had put in for the juried show, and the other two people liked better than this, and some said, no, this was interesting, but the others were very different.

151
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,220
And so,

152
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,962
It encouraged me to just keep on going.

153
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:29,126
I just kept on going and so then... You want me to put this back?

154
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:29,406
Yes.

155
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,006
Okay.

156
00:11:30,707 --> 00:11:40,112
So this past, was it November, we did the Beebe Estate Artisanal Ladies.

157
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:41,913
There were 10 of us there.

158
00:11:42,808 --> 00:11:46,232
and all different types of mediums.

159
00:11:46,472 --> 00:12:03,612
There was painting, photography, a lot of fiber arts, beautiful jewelry, and then some things like some holistic renderings and music to go with them and beautiful candles that people made.

160
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:05,313
A very interesting show.

161
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,614
It was probably one of the nicest shows that I've done.

162
00:12:08,634 --> 00:12:10,595
So this is running every year, right?

163
00:12:10,715 --> 00:12:13,196
Every year we have done it.

164
00:12:13,236 --> 00:12:19,119
The BB Estate has once a month for each type of shows.

165
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,522
And so this was my third Artisanal Ladies.

166
00:12:25,302 --> 00:12:26,043
it is all filled.

167
00:12:26,063 --> 00:12:28,184
We need to tell our viewers that's Melrose.

168
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:34,287
I'm sorry yeah so that's held in the BB Estate in Melrose which is a lovely little old house.

169
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:42,812
A lot of character, a lot of architecture and so you think you're visiting somebody's home that has beautiful artwork in it.

170
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:49,197
And so, yeah, we'd like more of that in Medford, I'll tell you.

171
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:59,864
And I know Mackie has been doing some wonderful new things with art and inviting artists to show their work and whatever.

172
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:03,427
But I would like to see a lot more, a lot more venues.

173
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:10,011
So, I continued and I needed to have paintings to put up on the wall.

174
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:13,833
I had a few, but not anything substantial.

175
00:13:14,353 --> 00:13:19,315
So after the Danvers show, I started really painting a lot.

176
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:22,776
This is one of my favorites.

177
00:13:23,276 --> 00:13:26,817
And as you see, almost the same colors as the first one.

178
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:34,120
And that's why I brought it, to show you that you can use almost the same color, except this is gold.

179
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:41,082
Yeah, there was an orangey gold, and black, and teal, which I love, I guess.

180
00:13:41,122 --> 00:13:45,104
So it's the same cop, different layers.

181
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:45,484
It is.

182
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:52,247
So what I did know, so on this one, I actually, and you could do it many ways, the way you like it.

183
00:13:52,307 --> 00:13:54,848
I actually asked my Facebook friend

184
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:59,226
art group, which way should I do this?

185
00:13:59,786 --> 00:14:02,668
And we all agreed this was the way, but you can't change this.

186
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:10,312
So in this one, I actually just mixed the certain colors and I poured it over the canvas, okay?

187
00:14:10,952 --> 00:14:17,516
And in different shapes and sizes of thinness of it, thickness of the lines.

188
00:14:19,537 --> 00:14:26,723
And then I took black and I swiped it with a piece of paper Oh, okay.

189
00:14:27,044 --> 00:14:46,460
And so you just swipe it and what happens is the black is opaque And the colors are not and I did their transport they call transparent So what I did with this one is I put a little bit of treadmill oil in the other colors aside from black so that when you

190
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:58,666
when you take the paper or whatever object you want and go across the paint, then all of the oils will come out of it.

191
00:14:58,806 --> 00:15:03,308
Because the black is opaque, it has the paint peep through.

192
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:08,011
So then, that was okay, but it was black and teal.

193
00:15:08,612 --> 00:15:10,313
And I'm starting to like gold a lot.

194
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:15,657
So you said you have a journal where you're writing all these experiments.

195
00:15:15,777 --> 00:15:16,598
No, I'm not.

196
00:15:17,018 --> 00:15:17,919
But you should, you know.

197
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:21,662
I should be doing that because there are a lot of things I forget.

198
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:30,627
Yeah, because when I teach the silk painting, and I encourage students to experiment.

199
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:33,229
And then I said, don't forget to write.

200
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,871
What did you do in this particular one?

201
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:43,375
Because if you want to repeat, just pull the card or whatever, the notebook, and you found this one.

202
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:46,557
And of course, take a picture, put it next to it.

203
00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:49,259
And I did that when I was doing my journaling.

204
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:56,083
in my journal, and when I look back at it now, it was really quite awful and quite ugly.

205
00:15:56,844 --> 00:16:01,707
And I really thought with each page I did I was getting better, but I wasn't.

206
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,489
But I feel now I have.

207
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:10,233
So what I did then was I took gold paint, I mixed it up, and I have some favorite paints.

208
00:16:10,754 --> 00:16:16,438
This was not one of my favorite gold paints, but it worked well for this particular

209
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,744
So then I thought, well what would happen if I put some gold on there and then swipe that too.

210
00:16:23,364 --> 00:16:26,327
What I did was I used a palette knife this time.

211
00:16:26,427 --> 00:16:27,848
So I could start and stop.

212
00:16:27,969 --> 00:16:34,174
So I took the gold paint and I put it there and then I could start and stop it.

213
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:37,237
So the canvas background was white.

214
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:39,679
This canvas was white.

215
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:45,024
I don't know if I brought you something that I poured colors.

216
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:49,969
But what you can do is what we call negative space.

217
00:16:50,649 --> 00:17:03,661
So if I just want a little bit of color or a little bit of a design, I could pour white paint all over here and then mix up colors or place colors on the canvas.

218
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:09,164
That will just cover it a certain amount and leave that negative space.

219
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:16,389
Let me see what I did bring here Okay, see if I have anything like that So, of course, I didn't bring it.

220
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:28,136
Oh, okay, but that's okay So we'll be showing your website where you have all the samples and or finished artwork Yeah, I do include the jewelry.

221
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:28,636
Also.

222
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:32,759
Oh, yes, my website actually has sections so that I have my

223
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,552
abstract paintings and my jewelry by category.

224
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:41,053
So, you know, for everybody to see.

225
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:41,533
Right.

226
00:17:41,753 --> 00:17:44,674
So then I would like to show you this one.

227
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:46,515
So that was a swipe.

228
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:47,295
Okay.

229
00:17:47,655 --> 00:17:51,917
And very, I mixed three different colors.

230
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:55,158
So this is also a swipe.

231
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:59,382
only use two again.

232
00:17:59,582 --> 00:17:59,802
Yeah.

233
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:07,026
And actually it looks like teal but it's teal with every other a lot of other colors mixed in and there's gray.

234
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:10,388
Every now and then you can see the gray come through.

235
00:18:10,868 --> 00:18:13,690
But I wanted this white to come just like that.

236
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,611
So after I poured it

237
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:21,215
I just poured white or I placed it with my brush and I just put the white there.

238
00:18:21,816 --> 00:18:24,718
And then I swipe this way and this way.

239
00:18:24,778 --> 00:18:30,543
But what I used this time was a long spatula that you use for frosting a cake.

240
00:18:31,183 --> 00:18:38,785
So you learn all these different ways to do things and they don't always come out as you plan.

241
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:43,105
Hence, accidental painting.

242
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:55,088
And what I like to do now is also, for people that would come to my shows and don't necessarily have wall space.

243
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:06,783
particularly want something this size for their wall, it's too big, it's too small, I have taken my art into tiles.

244
00:19:07,603 --> 00:19:26,269
So I make coasters, which is all my original art, hot plates, and I just started making these beautiful boxes I call everything or anything box, which are rosewood boxes with a six by six tile, and all those tiles

245
00:19:26,902 --> 00:19:34,853
are not only hand painted, but I resin them so that they actually, like the coasters, can be used.

246
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:39,279
They're not just for ornamental purposes or, you know, decorative design.

247
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:45,488
And those were very well received at the BB show.

248
00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:48,350
And I did sell some paintings there.

249
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:57,436
So for all intent and purposes, people say I can call myself an artist now, since I've won a ribbon and I sold some paintings.

250
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:02,380
So I'm feeling really good about it and really excited.

251
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,881
Oh, that's great.

252
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:08,464
And there is one more piece I would like to show you, because when I mentioned the gold.

253
00:20:08,564 --> 00:20:08,864
Yeah.

254
00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:09,324
OK.

255
00:20:11,338 --> 00:20:16,701
This is just one of my very favorites.

256
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:22,825
Not sure I'm going to be able to part with this one because I really love that gold.

257
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:27,067
And that gold is made by Winsor & Newton.

258
00:20:27,928 --> 00:20:31,850
Much more expensive paints that come in a tube.

259
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:34,412
that are very thick.

260
00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:36,674
And I like how you made this here right around too.

261
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:38,075
Oh, all the way around.

262
00:20:38,215 --> 00:20:40,917
Well, I try to do that and make it be interesting.

263
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:41,838
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

264
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:44,861
And I actually use my fingers to do that with.

265
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:46,402
Thank you for noticing.

266
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:46,843
Yeah.

267
00:20:46,903 --> 00:20:48,264
So this I really love.

268
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:54,429
And I've gotten some really good feedback on that.

269
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,951
So I actually

270
00:20:57,952 --> 00:21:00,414
decided that I would do more, a little more in the gold.

271
00:21:00,434 --> 00:21:05,779
I think if you will be doing bigger frame and push this little forward.

272
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:14,806
Yeah, I can do that because I do have some frames, and they do sell them, that are called float frames.

273
00:21:14,886 --> 00:21:17,268
Not floating frames, but float frames.

274
00:21:17,748 --> 00:21:22,933
So that mostly a lot, well half of this would stick out from the frame.

275
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:24,794
And it's very gallery worthy.

276
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:25,255
This is

277
00:21:25,955 --> 00:21:30,116
what they call a gallery wrapped level three canvas.

278
00:21:30,216 --> 00:21:43,661
So the price for this in selling is much higher than one that is seven eighths of an inch level one gallery.

279
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:45,461
But it all depends what somebody wants.

280
00:21:46,902 --> 00:21:52,103
And so what I'm going for is what intrigues me, what comes out of me.

281
00:21:52,163 --> 00:21:53,304
When I look at the canvas,

282
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,106
I knew what I wanted to do with this.

283
00:21:57,026 --> 00:22:01,209
I would say to incorporate red the way I wanted it to come.

284
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,711
I probably poured six.

285
00:22:05,132 --> 00:22:06,874
That came up, just did not work.

286
00:22:07,294 --> 00:22:09,216
They went into the black.

287
00:22:10,517 --> 00:22:22,966
In fact, my daughter, my granddaughter, just moved to a new house, and she asked me for a red, a black, and a white painting, those three colors.

288
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:25,127
I've done two.

289
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:27,348
They came maroon and gray.

290
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:30,330
So back to the drawing board on those.

291
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:35,432
So it's a lot of experimenting, a lot of feeling.

292
00:22:35,732 --> 00:22:42,635
There's a lot, I think you commented on one of mine that they kind of look

293
00:22:43,415 --> 00:22:47,037
you know like they're part of celestial part of the sky.

294
00:22:47,077 --> 00:22:48,738
So I'm trying to do a lot more of those.

295
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:50,019
Yeah it's like cosmic.

296
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:51,840
You can see it's from space.

297
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,062
Even the surface of planets.

298
00:22:55,302 --> 00:22:56,663
It's pictures from NASA.

299
00:22:56,763 --> 00:22:57,924
I'm trying to do that.

300
00:22:58,384 --> 00:23:02,787
So I'm practicing on some birch circles to do it.

301
00:23:02,827 --> 00:23:05,588
They're inexpensive and so I can practice on those.

302
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:07,349
And so this is canvas also?

303
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:08,250
This is canvas.

304
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,531
Did you try on the wood?

305
00:23:10,111 --> 00:23:20,823
Yes, so I do have a wood panelist on my website and it's an 11 by 14 and it's called cradled because it's this thick on the sides.

306
00:23:21,243 --> 00:23:22,585
It's that thick on the sides.

307
00:23:26,148 --> 00:23:29,731
Yes, you have to prep it differently than you would a canvas.

308
00:23:30,031 --> 00:23:39,217
I buy my canvases and they have three coats of gesso on it, which is a great primer, and it works.

309
00:23:39,297 --> 00:23:40,978
I don't have to put any more on.

310
00:23:41,498 --> 00:23:43,599
Wood, I do two or three coats.

311
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,900
I sand it in between so that you don't have that fuzz sticking up.

312
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,340
You still want the paint to adhere to the wood.

313
00:23:52,581 --> 00:24:01,683
And so one I have on my website is called Running River, and it, to me, looks like the sand underneath the water.

314
00:24:02,463 --> 00:24:03,744
the river flowing down.

315
00:24:05,105 --> 00:24:15,392
I just finished a resin on a cradled wood which is an 8x8 and I did put it in a float frame.

316
00:24:17,473 --> 00:24:19,274
and it kind of looks very cosmic.

317
00:24:19,754 --> 00:24:35,719
I used all metallics, copper and gold and rose gold and on black, a black background on the wooden surface and mixed the resin with paints.

318
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:41,201
They're actually a powdered mica, a mica powder and

319
00:24:42,821 --> 00:24:48,543
Resin is a very tricky thing to do and it's very sticky if you don't mix it well.

320
00:24:49,463 --> 00:24:53,865
I used it a lot with my tiles and it worked really well.

321
00:24:54,145 --> 00:24:55,386
I didn't have a problem.

322
00:24:55,646 --> 00:24:57,846
Well, the first couple of times you do have a problem.

323
00:24:57,866 --> 00:25:00,788
You have to get used to mixing it well and pouring it.

324
00:25:02,488 --> 00:25:30,275
It's very different on paintings when you're using different types of paints acrylics or powders So some of the powders if you don't mix them well enough will clump In the resin and then you've just ruined something and it's very expensive to use resin But the one I did I love it really came out very you probably can do this on Glass I have poured on glass.

325
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:31,255
I have two one

326
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:46,604
One is called The Monster, and I did put black on the background, and shades of browns, beige, and gold, and I think a little copper in there, with a negative space.

327
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:50,326
And it did not come out as I planned.

328
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,562
It's not one of my favorites, but quite a few people love it because it's odd.

329
00:25:58,222 --> 00:25:59,722
Well, everyone has different tastes.

330
00:25:59,782 --> 00:26:01,603
Yeah, everybody does.

331
00:26:01,823 --> 00:26:08,845
And it's interesting to me to say, oh, I don't like that one or whatever.

332
00:26:08,885 --> 00:26:11,626
It's not what I wanted, but somebody else might want it.

333
00:26:12,926 --> 00:26:18,308
But on the bottom side of anything, it comes from you.

334
00:26:18,408 --> 00:26:18,748
It's mine.

335
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:23,290
I'm not happy with it.

336
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,712
It's very hard for me to present that to the public.

337
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,055
But like you say, somebody else might like it.

338
00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:33,197
But I'm very fussy.

339
00:26:34,237 --> 00:26:35,698
And so I'll just do it over.

340
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,360
And that's the nicest thing about acrylic paint.

341
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,341
It's not like oils.

342
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:44,784
that I can actually prep the canvas again and pour over it.

343
00:26:44,924 --> 00:26:46,745
I have quite a few I've done that with.

344
00:26:46,985 --> 00:26:47,325
Okay.

345
00:26:47,705 --> 00:26:48,746
I've been so much happier.

346
00:26:48,766 --> 00:26:51,607
Yeah, well it reminds me of this Japanese technique.

347
00:26:51,808 --> 00:26:53,168
It's called Saminaguchi.

348
00:26:53,368 --> 00:26:53,609
Yes.

349
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:56,610
That's when you put the ink in the water.

350
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:57,070
Right.

351
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,352
And then you're doing whatever and then you put over the paper.

352
00:27:00,372 --> 00:27:00,953
The paper.

353
00:27:01,013 --> 00:27:04,735
And then pull it out and it could be abstract whatever.

354
00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:05,035
Right.

355
00:27:05,835 --> 00:27:06,035
Right.

356
00:27:06,536 --> 00:27:24,027
Part of the challenge to some of these are, if you, and I didn't bring one like that, if you just did what they call, you can do a flip cup or a poured cup, okay?

357
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:33,473
And the difference being, once you level your paint, you could take, by the way, you could take two containers and fill them exactly the same.

358
00:27:34,794 --> 00:27:38,896
And then pour them on the canvas and you wouldn't recognize one from the other.

359
00:27:38,936 --> 00:27:40,317
They don't look anything alike.

360
00:27:40,977 --> 00:27:42,318
So you have to master.

361
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:42,838
Right.

362
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:46,981
You have to master manipulation of that once it hits the canvas.

363
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:52,424
And that's a challenge all the time because usually you love what comes out of the cup.

364
00:27:52,484 --> 00:27:54,145
It's like, oh, this is gorgeous.

365
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:57,827
If it stayed that way, this big, you would love it.

366
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:03,850
Once you move it, you sometimes have to tilt it so that you lose the best part.

367
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:15,914
or you have too much of one color and you're trying to get rid of it and when you do that the other side comes out like just blah and so that's a repour.

368
00:28:16,254 --> 00:28:17,295
Are you planning to teach?

369
00:28:17,315 --> 00:28:19,615
I would love to.

370
00:28:19,716 --> 00:28:23,717
When I feel that I know it well enough to explain it

371
00:28:24,017 --> 00:28:44,237
yeah well to people um a lot of people on my facebook groups are doing that now and it's so exciting however um when people don't make a nice painting they're kind of upset and so uh i you know just like when i taught jewelry i never had a

372
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,143
of anybody who didn't like what they made at the end of the class.

373
00:28:50,643 --> 00:28:53,626
So I would like to be able to get to a point.

374
00:28:53,706 --> 00:28:53,906
What?

375
00:28:54,226 --> 00:28:55,648
You liked what you made?

376
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:56,889
No, that's what I meant to say.

377
00:28:56,929 --> 00:28:57,189
Sorry.

378
00:28:57,729 --> 00:29:01,213
Nobody ever complained that they didn't like what they made.

379
00:29:01,613 --> 00:29:04,936
And I guess I hoped it was my teaching ability.

380
00:29:05,476 --> 00:29:07,358
So I think I could teach.

381
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:15,305
I feel like I need more knowledge and experience myself before I could actually charge somebody.

382
00:29:15,465 --> 00:29:21,330
Yeah, well tell all you is how you feel when you creating something?

383
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:34,701
Well, I have I actually Okay, and then don't mean to be you know in a sad frame of mind, but as you well know I had a health problem and

384
00:29:35,585 --> 00:29:41,708
And I just felt like, oh my God, I can't be me anymore.

385
00:29:42,368 --> 00:29:43,308
What am I gonna do?

386
00:29:43,328 --> 00:29:45,009
I can't do the same things.

387
00:29:45,129 --> 00:29:47,030
I can't, whatever.

388
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:57,794
And so I started looking into myself and I said, okay, so you can express yourself in a blue, low mood.

389
00:29:58,235 --> 00:29:59,095
My life is over.

390
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,548
or you can do something about it, and I'm a fighter.

391
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:08,613
So that's when I started going on YouTube and said, okay, what can I do?

392
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:12,095
I physically can't do yoga anymore.

393
00:30:12,135 --> 00:30:16,079
I physically can't do a lot of things anymore, but there's things I can do.

394
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:19,822
That used my mind and thought about my jewelry and

395
00:30:20,954 --> 00:30:22,936
what I called the designs in mind.

396
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:26,140
Then I thought well I might have other designs in my mind.

397
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:26,921
Of course.

398
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:31,465
And so I went on YouTube like I said just looking and looking and I started.

399
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:37,812
I started journaling, I started learning about things, I started to do this.

400
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:39,814
But let's go roll back.

401
00:30:40,495 --> 00:30:42,537
The PMC, how that start?

402
00:30:43,563 --> 00:30:51,588
That started, well let's see, I was beading, I started beading in about 2000 and just for myself to make jewelry.

403
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:54,290
And just because you retired about that time?

404
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,591
No, no, I was still working.

405
00:30:55,611 --> 00:30:56,311
Oh, you're still working.

406
00:30:56,472 --> 00:31:08,560
I was still working, I was working in a pharmaceutical company actually right here in Medford and I wore a bracelet to work one day and I was doing crystals at that time and one of the girls said,

407
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,981
That's beautiful.

408
00:31:10,021 --> 00:31:10,842
Where did you get it?

409
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,124
I made it.

410
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:13,585
Can you make me one?

411
00:31:14,026 --> 00:31:14,426
Started.

412
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:23,117
Every time I wore a piece of jewelry, this one girl, Jennifer, her name is, would buy something for me or order something special in colors.

413
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:27,622
So everybody in the office kind of said, wow, where'd you get that?

414
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:39,996
So I started making a lot of beaded things, mostly crystals and very light types of things and I found out about West Medford Open Studios.

415
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:43,359
Somebody said to me, you should sell your jewelry there, it's beautiful.

416
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,286
So I applied and I got accepted and the very first year

417
00:31:50,627 --> 00:31:57,052
I was in a house on the second floor, and I forget the name of the street.

418
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:04,978
A lovely woman and her two daughters welcomed me and told me, you can use my dining room table.

419
00:32:05,018 --> 00:32:06,579
They had already put a cloth for me.

420
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,962
And I started to put my jewelry up and they're like, don't you have any prices?

421
00:32:13,842 --> 00:32:15,963
And I said, oh, you mean people are going to buy it?

422
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:21,184
I thought it was just like to meet the artist and talk about it, whatever.

423
00:32:21,204 --> 00:32:23,245
And they said, oh no, people buy things.

424
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:27,626
So I quickly took pieces of paper and wrote prices.

425
00:32:27,686 --> 00:32:29,967
I didn't have business cards, I didn't have anything.

426
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:38,860
And at the end of the day, I mean, people were, wow, those colors, they're beautiful.

427
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:41,403
What made you put those together?

428
00:32:41,824 --> 00:32:43,406
And I was so happy.

429
00:32:43,426 --> 00:32:45,089
I sold quite a few things.

430
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,474
And I went home, and I called my best friend, and I said, they liked me.

431
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:51,695
They really liked me.

432
00:32:52,356 --> 00:32:53,476
And she said, OK.

433
00:32:54,157 --> 00:33:01,203
I went back the next day, and almost closing, a woman came rushing into me and said, I have this top.

434
00:33:01,263 --> 00:33:03,605
My son's getting married in three weeks in New York.

435
00:33:03,645 --> 00:33:05,246
Can you make me something to go with this?

436
00:33:05,987 --> 00:33:07,188
I'm like, you're kidding, right?

437
00:33:07,628 --> 00:33:10,129
I had never made a commissioned piece, really.

438
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:14,212
She actually gave me some of her grandmother's beads.

439
00:33:15,612 --> 00:33:19,835
I made three different pieces using some of hers and some of mine.

440
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:22,917
She let me keep the top to work with.

441
00:33:23,557 --> 00:33:28,240
And she came to my house two days before leaving from New York.

442
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:35,483
bought the piece to match her top, and bought the other two pieces to give as gifts to the bridesmaids.

443
00:33:36,543 --> 00:33:39,024
So I was like, okay, I'm doing this.

444
00:33:39,724 --> 00:33:41,565
So I beaded for 10 years.

445
00:33:42,545 --> 00:33:46,087
And then I just sort of said, I'm kind of running out of ideas.

446
00:33:46,747 --> 00:33:54,110
So I went to the bead shop in Lexington, where I bought most of my beads when not online.

447
00:33:55,262 --> 00:34:09,668
And they were offering these classes and I saw this beautiful silver jewelry and it said, this is a lump of clay that makes this beautiful jewelry and it was a picture.

448
00:34:10,388 --> 00:34:13,889
And I said, oh my God, I have to learn how to do this now.

449
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:14,950
Took one class.

450
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,731
made a really nice piece, which I sold recently.

451
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:23,413
I hadn't put it out for a while because that was my first one, but I did sell it recently.

452
00:34:24,053 --> 00:34:31,257
And went home, bought books, DVDs, YouTube, and whatever, and I went into business.

453
00:34:31,617 --> 00:34:32,077
That was it.

454
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:36,759
So that year when I did West Medford Open Studios, I did some and some.

455
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:39,040
Some beaded, some silver.

456
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,742
What year is that?

457
00:34:40,762 --> 00:34:41,283
That was 2010.

458
00:34:41,644 --> 00:34:41,904
Okay.

459
00:34:41,924 --> 00:34:42,144
So yeah, 2010.

460
00:34:51,902 --> 00:34:55,864
A woman came to me and said, oh, is this metal clay?

461
00:34:55,884 --> 00:34:56,544
I said, yeah.

462
00:34:57,224 --> 00:34:59,525
She said, oh, I took this class.

463
00:34:59,845 --> 00:35:04,867
I lived in California, and they're so advanced, there's none here.

464
00:35:04,887 --> 00:35:07,108
Nobody I know makes this stuff.

465
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,930
I went to intensive, month-long

466
00:35:12,014 --> 00:35:15,157
classes and nothing I made came out good.

467
00:35:16,398 --> 00:35:19,000
So she said, would you be willing to teach me?

468
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,643
And I thought, oh my God, I've never taught this.

469
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:24,465
Like you're saying to me, can I teach?

470
00:35:24,765 --> 00:35:25,286
I don't know.

471
00:35:25,446 --> 00:35:27,608
I know my stuff, but can I teach?

472
00:35:27,968 --> 00:35:29,169
But did I know my stuff?

473
00:35:29,249 --> 00:35:29,970
I just started.

474
00:35:33,613 --> 00:35:39,960
Marika, she's a very lovely girl, and another woman at that time that I knew was a beater, was interested.

475
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:46,427
So I had my first class in my living room, and she loved what she made.

476
00:35:47,068 --> 00:35:50,391
She's taken, oh, maybe six or seven classes from me.

477
00:35:53,174 --> 00:36:06,810
So after the Mystic Art Gallery closed and I stopped doing the classes there, I turned my spare room into a workshop and bought all kinds of things so that I could continue to teach.

478
00:36:07,391 --> 00:36:09,733
And I taught quite a few classes still.

479
00:36:10,874 --> 00:36:15,356
just stopped when I started painting, but now I've had three requests.

480
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:17,577
When are you going to do the next class?

481
00:36:18,238 --> 00:36:27,142
So I'm thinking I'm going to have March and April free because I didn't mention to you starting the beginning of March

482
00:36:27,842 --> 00:36:32,703
My artwork is going to be in the new gallery at the Medford Public Library.

483
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:33,764
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

484
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:41,386
So they opened it last fall and I've been asked to... Is that only just for show or sale also?

485
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,047
Also, yeah.

486
00:36:43,587 --> 00:36:45,407
I am planning to have a reception.

487
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:46,708
I don't have a date yet.

488
00:36:47,088 --> 00:36:49,648
I need to talk to the powers that be.

489
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:54,690
And then... I think another option is multicultural center in Cambridge.

490
00:36:55,569 --> 00:36:56,410
You should apply for that.

491
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,330
Okay.

492
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,171
Kaiserschule exhibit will be there.

493
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,232
Oh, nice.

494
00:37:01,712 --> 00:37:01,952
Good.

495
00:37:02,352 --> 00:37:05,394
And then I'm doing the Mellows Arts Festival the end of April.

496
00:37:06,094 --> 00:37:08,155
Again, at Memorial Hall.

497
00:37:08,235 --> 00:37:09,396
It's a great take.

498
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:14,138
I know you've been there visiting me many times, but I'll be doing my artwork.

499
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:21,481
And then in May, I'll be at Mr. Coffee Roasters on the walls where you can have your coffee.

500
00:37:21,521 --> 00:37:22,962
You can see my artwork there.

501
00:37:24,262 --> 00:37:32,386
And so I feel brave that I ventured out and have actually applied and asked people and they like it.

502
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:36,568
Well I'm your admirer and I like people who are creating.

503
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,329
But let's go back.

504
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:40,730
So it didn't start from nowhere.

505
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,691
Obviously your parents

506
00:37:44,092 --> 00:37:45,633
No, I'll tell you where it started.

507
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:49,956
When you have children and you get involved in the school.

508
00:37:50,116 --> 00:37:58,602
So we had a very small grammar school up by Tufts and I lived on the hillside of Medford for many years.

509
00:37:59,503 --> 00:38:08,888
And so my children went to the school there and the teachers actually didn't have budgets for books and things like that.

510
00:38:09,448 --> 00:38:18,033
So my daughter read at home when she was four and she went to first grade and these books were 12 years old.

511
00:38:19,794 --> 00:38:28,900
But by law in Massachusetts the books can be no older than six years old in the new writings, the new editions in other words.

512
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,363
So they were reading books that probably I had when I was a kid.

513
00:38:33,043 --> 00:38:35,405
So the teacher said, we have no money.

514
00:38:36,305 --> 00:38:37,986
So I said, how about if we run a fair?

515
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:39,768
Well, I had never done that either.

516
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,962
I masterminded this thing and got some parents together.

517
00:38:45,982 --> 00:38:52,404
We actually formed a group called TAP, Teachers and Parents, instead of PTA that we didn't have to pay to register.

518
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:56,084
So I decided we needed a big raffle item.

519
00:38:56,725 --> 00:38:59,485
And then we had like Christmas, it was gonna be a Christmas fair.

520
00:38:59,885 --> 00:39:02,306
We were gonna make all these lovely little Christmas things.

521
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,987
So quilts, never made a quilt either.

522
00:39:05,627 --> 00:39:07,887
So I looked up some designs that were easy.

523
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:09,748
I drew one out.

524
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:19,317
picked the colors, gave each of the women the colors and the design to put together, so sewing a whole strip.

525
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:29,425
We did strips each and then we sat and put it all together into the backing, like a little sewing bee, quilting bee, and we raffled that off.

526
00:39:30,085 --> 00:39:44,212
and the money we made between the raffling of the quilt and all of the Christmas table that we did, we made enough money to buy books for the first and second grades.

527
00:39:44,652 --> 00:39:47,554
However, the school system would not let us

528
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:51,617
give the money to the teachers to buy the books.

529
00:39:52,478 --> 00:39:53,619
It was against the rules.

530
00:39:53,879 --> 00:39:56,781
So we went and bought the books and we brought them to the school.

531
00:39:56,801 --> 00:39:59,364
I had them delivered to the school from us, a gift.

532
00:40:00,405 --> 00:40:02,386
And the teachers were just like overwhelmed.

533
00:40:03,728 --> 00:40:04,608
So then people

534
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:11,893
So it continued for a while because people that saw the things I made during that Christmas fair.

535
00:40:11,953 --> 00:40:16,976
I made holly hobby dolls, tooth fairy pillows, kinds of things like that.

536
00:40:17,077 --> 00:40:19,178
Oh, Della Robbia wreaths and whatever.

537
00:40:19,758 --> 00:40:22,500
So I kind of started a little business on the side.

538
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,921
Yeah, but where did you learn that?

539
00:40:24,181 --> 00:40:25,442
I just taught myself.

540
00:40:25,722 --> 00:40:27,023
Oh, self-teaching.

541
00:40:27,683 --> 00:40:31,167
Yeah, my mother was very good at embroidering.

542
00:40:31,987 --> 00:40:35,030
So maybe, you're making me think way back now.

543
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:38,033
My father was a custom upholsterer, okay?

544
00:40:38,453 --> 00:40:41,196
So my father could make a chair.

545
00:40:41,716 --> 00:40:43,098
You gave him the fabric.

546
00:40:43,938 --> 00:40:48,983
So the arm here and the arm here had the same exact flower on it.

547
00:40:49,263 --> 00:40:52,787
He matched everything perfectly, every stripe.

548
00:40:53,528 --> 00:41:01,580
And when he used to work in our basement two nights a week on his own from his regular job, he would let me make buttons.

549
00:41:02,755 --> 00:41:23,191
see now you're making me think where this came from and so there was this little machine and you cut out the fabric and you put a little cotton and then there was a metal bottom and then a top and it was like a press and he was having me make all these beautiful buttons and I would be so proud to say I made the sofa.

550
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:24,852
you know, hit all the buttons.

551
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:26,413
So I guess that's true.

552
00:41:26,774 --> 00:41:31,758
My mother, great embroidery, ton of patience with that.

553
00:41:32,238 --> 00:41:43,247
And then later on, when she would see me do things, I started making pillows to match like people's bedroom sets and added silk flowers to them.

554
00:41:43,747 --> 00:41:44,948
So she started to do some of that.

555
00:41:44,968 --> 00:41:46,189
But the flowers, you didn't make it?

556
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:46,629
No.

557
00:41:46,689 --> 00:41:48,631
No, I just bought the flowers.

558
00:41:48,691 --> 00:41:49,832
No, I just bought it.

559
00:41:50,392 --> 00:41:53,154
all, but the fabric and the matching and whatever.

560
00:41:53,454 --> 00:41:55,095
And so she started to do that too.

561
00:41:55,215 --> 00:41:58,397
So, you know, I guess... So what about your children?

562
00:41:59,657 --> 00:42:00,558
The son is a filmmaker.

563
00:42:00,578 --> 00:42:01,558
The oldest son is a filmmaker.

564
00:42:01,578 --> 00:42:08,082
I have one son who's a filmmaker and photographer and a musician.

565
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,043
He plays several instruments.

566
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:11,604
He plays bass and guitar.

567
00:42:11,644 --> 00:42:12,824
He has a famous movie.

568
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:14,685
He has two movies.

569
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,106
One's called May I Be Frank.

570
00:42:17,247 --> 00:42:17,487
Yeah.

571
00:42:17,847 --> 00:42:18,687
Great movie.

572
00:42:18,727 --> 00:42:23,290
It's still going around the world as far as Australia now.

573
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:31,614
And his other film was called Love Bomb, which was another fabulous movie about service and helping people.

574
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:33,875
Maybe we should ask the show on Medford TV3.

575
00:42:34,015 --> 00:42:34,996
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

576
00:42:35,056 --> 00:42:35,296
Yeah.

577
00:42:35,556 --> 00:42:37,517
Yeah, it is available for showing now.

578
00:42:39,018 --> 00:42:42,660
And so that's my oldest son.

579
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:52,946
My middle son, Mark, lives in Hilton Head, South Carolina, and he's an electrician and he loves it down there.

580
00:42:53,026 --> 00:42:54,287
Today he posted it's 72 degrees.

581
00:42:56,008 --> 00:42:57,569
and he loves the weather.

582
00:42:57,669 --> 00:42:59,030
Yeah, not bad here today.

583
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:00,230
Yeah, he'll never come back.

584
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,931
I suppose 50 here today.

585
00:43:02,011 --> 00:43:04,092
But he doesn't do any art, no?

586
00:43:04,353 --> 00:43:06,234
Mark is a bassist.

587
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:07,034
He plays the bass.

588
00:43:07,915 --> 00:43:09,776
So he's a musician too.

589
00:43:09,856 --> 00:43:10,476
That's his art.

590
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:16,519
My daughter is a beautiful singer, beautiful voice.

591
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:17,620
She has an

592
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:20,770
Been out singing in quite a while.

593
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:22,471
Where's the music came in the family?

594
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:23,471
What side?

595
00:43:23,571 --> 00:43:24,472
Oh, I used to sing.

596
00:43:24,532 --> 00:43:25,272
Oh, you were singing.

597
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:25,632
Oh, yeah.

598
00:43:25,732 --> 00:43:27,873
I sang when I was a young girl.

599
00:43:27,893 --> 00:43:28,413
I see.

600
00:43:28,453 --> 00:43:31,275
And then I was in the Mystic Players here in Medford.

601
00:43:31,335 --> 00:43:31,715
Right, right.

602
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:32,795
I remember you mentioned once.

603
00:43:32,815 --> 00:43:33,636
Yeah, right.

604
00:43:34,076 --> 00:43:36,917
So yeah, I guess we kind of have some talent in the family.

605
00:43:36,957 --> 00:43:37,377
Absolutely.

606
00:43:37,437 --> 00:43:38,838
So she's a beautiful singer.

607
00:43:39,198 --> 00:43:40,799
She draws really well, too.

608
00:43:41,139 --> 00:43:41,899
She's a jewelry.

609
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:42,840
She makes jewelry.

610
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,841
And the grandchildren right now they be oh my goodness.

611
00:43:46,901 --> 00:43:49,402
My granddaughter just turned 16 years old.

612
00:43:49,582 --> 00:43:54,904
Yeah, and my grandson Is 13 and he's quite the artist.

613
00:43:54,984 --> 00:43:57,525
He loves to do a lot of artwork.

614
00:43:57,605 --> 00:44:03,486
In fact for Christmas I bought him a whole set of molding clay because he loves to work with his hands.

615
00:44:03,927 --> 00:44:06,487
So hopefully I'll see some My granddaughter

616
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:13,870
Oh my god, she took dance for about six or seven years and she really loved it.

617
00:44:14,531 --> 00:44:19,853
And she's not doing that right now, but nothing really artistic about her.

618
00:44:19,933 --> 00:44:22,855
Well, dance is already art, work also.

619
00:44:23,015 --> 00:44:25,956
But not, you know, in drawing, things like that.

620
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:27,437
Well, they have grandma for that.

621
00:44:27,997 --> 00:44:29,098
They do, they do.

622
00:44:29,158 --> 00:44:33,160
And a crochet came upon between the PMC and painting.

623
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,541
I don't even know.

624
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:43,146
I think I, well, I do know it was after my surgery and I was in the house, you know, all winter long and I was like, oh, what am I going to do?

625
00:44:43,226 --> 00:44:44,127
What am I going to do?

626
00:44:44,967 --> 00:44:51,671
And I don't know why it even came in my head, but I crocheted years and years ago when my kids were little.

627
00:44:52,291 --> 00:45:00,796
And so I looked on YouTube, that's all I can say, and I watched the steps and watched the steps and I still do.

628
00:45:00,816 --> 00:45:02,497
Do you hear about paper clay?

629
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:04,469
No.

630
00:45:05,249 --> 00:45:05,970
Check it out.

631
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:06,630
Okay.

632
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:07,751
Paper clay.

633
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:08,372
Paper clay.

634
00:45:08,392 --> 00:45:08,492
Yes.

635
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:09,573
And what can you make with it?

636
00:45:09,593 --> 00:45:14,036
You can do sculpting or whatever you want to do, a small decoration.

637
00:45:14,196 --> 00:45:14,997
That could be my favorite.

638
00:45:15,017 --> 00:45:22,162
And actually it can combine with your painting, make it more kind of interesting.

639
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:22,443
Right.

640
00:45:22,463 --> 00:45:24,124
There's two different types of media.

641
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,286
So, well,

642
00:45:27,126 --> 00:45:31,169
I'm very happy that you finally made it because we talked about it a long time ago.

643
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,691
I know we did.

644
00:45:32,711 --> 00:45:33,892
It was my fault.

645
00:45:34,112 --> 00:45:34,712
No, no, no.

646
00:45:34,792 --> 00:45:35,533
No faults.

647
00:45:35,573 --> 00:45:36,413
Everything is fine.

648
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:41,777
So I appreciate it and I hope my viewers enjoy our talk.

649
00:45:42,278 --> 00:45:45,961
And so I'll see my viewers next time with a new guest.

650
00:45:46,261 --> 00:45:46,761
Bye.

651
00:45:46,781 --> 00:45:47,102
Okay.

652
00:45:47,322 --> 00:45:47,802
Bye.

653
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:56,400
God Bless.
