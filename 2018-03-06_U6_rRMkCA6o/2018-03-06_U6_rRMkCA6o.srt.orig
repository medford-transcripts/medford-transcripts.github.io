1
00:00:02,413 --> 00:00:02,514
do

2
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show Meeting Interested People.

3
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Today my guest Louise Mastuchuat.

4
00:00:32,227 --> 00:00:34,628
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if I just say Louise, everybody knows you.

5
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:35,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

6
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:45,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're involved in everywhere, like events around Medford, Circle the Square, Cachet.

7
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:46,872
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, what is Cachet?

8
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:52,094
[SPEAKER_04]: CACHE means Coalition for Arts, Culture and a Healthy Economy.

9
00:00:52,934 --> 00:01:05,818
[SPEAKER_04]: So what that means is we want to take arts and culture and involve the businesses throughout the city to recognize and appreciate it and help us put that forth to the entire city.

10
00:01:06,318 --> 00:01:15,905
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so Louise and I, we met when I was taking her class, when she was teaching PMC, pure metal clay, jewelry.

11
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:20,749
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the gallery does not exist anymore, where the classes were held.

12
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:34,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, some people in Medford City Hall will listen to us and give us the opportunity to show how many talented people live in town, in the city, that they can show

13
00:01:35,415 --> 00:01:37,396
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous amount of artwork.

14
00:01:38,677 --> 00:01:44,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'd like to tell you about that because it will be in the Medford transcript today, so I won't be giving away secrets.

15
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:56,726
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a group of us, and we are calling for Arts Collaborative Medford, and we are looking for a home for arts and culture.

16
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,386
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been working on this

17
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:04,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've been working on it for a few years with a couple of city councilors.

18
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:18,153
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we have a group that, with like minds, are going to try to work on this and be fundraising and awareness and whatever.

19
00:02:18,193 --> 00:02:20,833
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll probably take a while, but I think we'll do it.

20
00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:22,714
[SPEAKER_04]: We're very determined to do it.

21
00:02:22,794 --> 00:02:24,574
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm very excited about this.

22
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:25,815
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

23
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:28,277
[SPEAKER_00]: The dream will come true.

24
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:29,859
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it will.

25
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,225
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is new, a media you started working with.

26
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:34,966
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

27
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:41,033
[SPEAKER_00]: And tell us about why, how you came upon this particular... Okay.

28
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:50,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first let me say that, like you say, I did precious metal clay.

29
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:55,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought, made it, sold it, taught classes in it.

30
00:02:56,764 --> 00:03:01,007
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get to a point where people say, do you do anything else?

31
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:04,690
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought, well, yeah, I do a lot of things.

32
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,531
[SPEAKER_04]: I volunteer.

33
00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:08,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I belong to this organization, that organization.

34
00:03:08,493 --> 00:03:12,516
[SPEAKER_04]: But they seem to want more from me for some reason, like that wasn't enough.

35
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:16,260
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of a sudden, I'm a YouTuber.

36
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,145
[SPEAKER_04]: So I learned most of my precious clay metal jewelry from YouTube videos.

37
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:35,809
[SPEAKER_04]: DVDs and so I went on YouTube and I thought I'd like to start doing things with mixed media like in painting and colors and learning about textures.

38
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:48,773
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started this journal and I learned about different kinds of molding paste, using sand, using objects, different kind of paints, sprays, watercolors.

39
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,013
[SPEAKER_04]: So I made like a journal.

40
00:03:50,793 --> 00:04:02,505
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one day when I was on YouTube, I saw this acrylic abstract painting and I always thought, oh, I can't paint or draw or anything.

41
00:04:02,845 --> 00:04:04,887
[SPEAKER_04]: And people would say to me, you're so creative.

42
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:06,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you draw?

43
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:07,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you paint?

44
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd say, no, I can't.

45
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:11,834
[SPEAKER_04]: So I came across

46
00:04:13,615 --> 00:04:19,278
[SPEAKER_04]: this YouTube video that talked about accidental painting.

47
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,820
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said probably everything I do is going to be an accident.

48
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,823
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was discovered back in the 1930s by a very famous painter who

49
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:46,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember his name, but he's in every gallery worldwide and he's in MoMA in New York and whatever and he stumbled upon it when he decided to mix paints together instead of doing it with a brush.

50
00:04:48,147 --> 00:04:59,377
[SPEAKER_04]: and he poured it on the canvas and he tilted it and he added things to it and It was beautiful and people loved it and said oh, I like your new work He didn't think it was his new work.

51
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:00,418
[SPEAKER_04]: He thought it was his work.

52
00:05:00,678 --> 00:05:00,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

53
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:03,801
[SPEAKER_04]: So I Delved into it.

54
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:11,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I had I bought a lot of things about tons of paint about you need to have pouring mediums you need to

55
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:18,120
[SPEAKER_04]: learn all about density and opacity of paints, which I never knew before.

56
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,001
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's all trial and error.

57
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:28,803
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I started buying canvases, some inexpensive because I felt like they were going to be flops.

58
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:34,425
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first few I did were unrecognizable.

59
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:40,407
[SPEAKER_04]: All the paint muddled together and I had brown and orange and I did not intend to have those colors.

60
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:45,551
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I belong to Danvers Art Association in Danvers.

61
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:48,093
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great organization.

62
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:49,834
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about 100 years old.

63
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:55,699
[SPEAKER_04]: And they acquired a beautiful schoolhouse from the town, and they just maintain it.

64
00:05:55,799 --> 00:06:00,222
[SPEAKER_04]: They raise all their money through shows and the auction once a year.

65
00:06:00,302 --> 00:06:04,626
[SPEAKER_04]: They raise enough to heat the building, electricity, and just keep it going.

66
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:08,308
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a friend of mine who is a member,

67
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:11,311
[SPEAKER_04]: He said to me, why don't you join?

68
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:12,692
[SPEAKER_04]: So I joined.

69
00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:17,475
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first time I did anything was the Christmas fair.

70
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:22,539
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually had my jewelry and some crocheted items.

71
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:27,462
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then comes along the spring show.

72
00:06:28,163 --> 00:06:29,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I did the jewelry again.

73
00:06:30,344 --> 00:06:31,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Came the fall show.

74
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,847
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden, it's a jewelry art show.

75
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:49,406
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said, I'd love to put something up on the wall just to get people's impression actually of my artwork to see if I have any talent.

76
00:06:49,746 --> 00:06:55,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And I could walk around the room during this show as a member and listen to people talking.

77
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,711
[SPEAKER_04]: And I heard some really good comments.

78
00:06:58,271 --> 00:07:01,233
[SPEAKER_04]: So I should have probably taken this one out first.

79
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:04,796
[SPEAKER_04]: So this actually is the one

80
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:08,067
[SPEAKER_04]: that I submitted amongst the others.

81
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's pretty.

82
00:07:09,468 --> 00:07:12,068
[SPEAKER_04]: And I won third place ribbon.

83
00:07:12,888 --> 00:07:22,170
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I walked around that night of the show, I said, oh, this one won a ribbon, that one won a ribbon.

84
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,311
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was called into the other room and said, look who else won a ribbon.

85
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:33,952
[SPEAKER_04]: And my friend, who had introduced me to Danvers Art Association, Bob Marcellino, who you know, I think.

86
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:38,615
[SPEAKER_04]: had won a beautiful ribbon like first place or second place.

87
00:07:39,216 --> 00:07:40,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he said, no, no, no, not me.

88
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And he brought me over to my painting.

89
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:51,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw that ribbon and I can't tell you, I mean, I was screaming, I won a ribbon, I won a ribbon.

90
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:52,327
[SPEAKER_04]: And so,

91
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:57,249
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody was like, okay, we know now because we hear it.

92
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:04,213
[SPEAKER_04]: And so very probably some of my favorite colors are in there.

93
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:06,074
[SPEAKER_04]: The teal I really love.

94
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,815
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I use

95
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:13,297
[SPEAKER_04]: very different techniques and that's why I brought different ones to show you techniques.

96
00:08:13,337 --> 00:08:14,457
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll talk about this one, yeah.

97
00:08:14,697 --> 00:08:15,977
[SPEAKER_04]: This is called the tree ring.

98
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:22,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what I do with this, several things actually, it's a pour and a tree ring.

99
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,701
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I did with this was I knew the colors I wanted.

100
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:29,141
[SPEAKER_04]: This basically came the way I wanted it.

101
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:30,422
[SPEAKER_04]: It very rarely does.

102
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:33,763
[SPEAKER_04]: And I layered the colors into a cup.

103
00:08:34,163 --> 00:08:34,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to mix it.

104
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:36,464
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to mix it to a certain

105
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:49,152
[SPEAKER_04]: pouring consistency so that some of the paints that are opaque will go to the bottom of the cup and then the others will sit on it.

106
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:54,455
[SPEAKER_04]: and others will pour through it, depending on what you want the outcome to be.

107
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:58,176
[SPEAKER_04]: So this, called the tree ring, you basically fill your cup.

108
00:08:58,196 --> 00:08:59,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can see the... Right.

109
00:08:59,877 --> 00:09:02,198
[SPEAKER_04]: You basically fill your cup, but I didn't just want it.

110
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:09,201
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some that are just a whole circle and they just keep going around and around, and they're lovely, but I kind of wanted this to go over.

111
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:13,783
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I did that, I held the cup, and you have to hold your head steady.

112
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:19,307
[SPEAKER_04]: and go in a little tight little circle, tight little circle, tight little circle.

113
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:23,691
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see these are so much closer than this part.

114
00:09:24,032 --> 00:09:30,698
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I decided, well, what would happen if I let go a little bit and go a little bit wider and a little bit wider and a little bit wider?

115
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:35,161
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I left it there because the next thing in the cup was going to be white.

116
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:37,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I really didn't want white in the middle.

117
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:41,866
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just pulled the cup up and I poured the rest of it here.

118
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:44,408
[SPEAKER_04]: So then you see, very different.

119
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,810
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got a few little planets going on there.

120
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:48,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.

121
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:49,051
[SPEAKER_04]: And cells.

122
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:56,417
[SPEAKER_04]: So everybody who does this type of abstract painting complains, I don't get any cells.

123
00:09:57,157 --> 00:10:06,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the things you can put in there are silicone, treadmill oils, alcohol, different things.

124
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:06,779
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's canvas.

125
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:07,619
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on canvas.

126
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,180
[SPEAKER_04]: This is on canvas, yeah.

127
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I work on canvas.

128
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk more about other substrates.

129
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,321
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is on canvas.

130
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,881
[SPEAKER_04]: So what year is that you did?

131
00:10:17,342 --> 00:10:19,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I did this last year.

132
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:19,742
2017.

133
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:20,182
[SPEAKER_00]: I started June...

134
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:25,724
[SPEAKER_04]: 2017.

135
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

136
00:10:25,864 --> 00:10:27,944
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the fall, I want my first ribbon.

137
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:28,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

138
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:30,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I frame some of my things.

139
00:10:30,585 --> 00:10:31,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's interesting.

140
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:32,846
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a box thing, right?

141
00:10:32,906 --> 00:10:42,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's actually sort of like a shadow box, but it doesn't, you know, it has the painting be able to come out a little bit.

142
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:43,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

143
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:45,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really frames it well.

144
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,191
[SPEAKER_04]: These are my favorite types of frames.

145
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:48,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

146
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:49,931
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have to put it all together.

147
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:50,512
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wood, right?

148
00:10:50,672 --> 00:10:51,312
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's wooden.

149
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:58,794
[SPEAKER_04]: So it takes some drilling and you get acquainted with your electric drill again.

150
00:10:59,394 --> 00:11:17,019
[SPEAKER_04]: And so from here, there were two other paintings that I had put in for the juried show, and the other two people liked better than this, and some said, no, this was interesting, but the others were very different.

151
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,220
[SPEAKER_04]: And so,

152
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,962
[SPEAKER_04]: It encouraged me to just keep on going.

153
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:29,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I just kept on going and so then... You want me to put this back?

154
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:29,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

155
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

156
00:11:30,707 --> 00:11:40,112
[SPEAKER_04]: So this past, was it November, we did the Beebe Estate Artisanal Ladies.

157
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:41,913
[SPEAKER_04]: There were 10 of us there.

158
00:11:42,808 --> 00:11:46,232
[SPEAKER_04]: and all different types of mediums.

159
00:11:46,472 --> 00:12:03,612
[SPEAKER_04]: There was painting, photography, a lot of fiber arts, beautiful jewelry, and then some things like some holistic renderings and music to go with them and beautiful candles that people made.

160
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:05,313
[SPEAKER_04]: A very interesting show.

161
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,614
[SPEAKER_04]: It was probably one of the nicest shows that I've done.

162
00:12:08,634 --> 00:12:10,595
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is running every year, right?

163
00:12:10,715 --> 00:12:13,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Every year we have done it.

164
00:12:13,236 --> 00:12:19,119
[SPEAKER_04]: The BB Estate has once a month for each type of shows.

165
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,522
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this was my third Artisanal Ladies.

166
00:12:25,302 --> 00:12:26,043
[SPEAKER_04]: it is all filled.

167
00:12:26,063 --> 00:12:28,184
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to tell our viewers that's Melrose.

168
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:34,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry yeah so that's held in the BB Estate in Melrose which is a lovely little old house.

169
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:42,812
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of character, a lot of architecture and so you think you're visiting somebody's home that has beautiful artwork in it.

170
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:49,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, we'd like more of that in Medford, I'll tell you.

171
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:59,864
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know Mackie has been doing some wonderful new things with art and inviting artists to show their work and whatever.

172
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:03,427
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would like to see a lot more, a lot more venues.

173
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:10,011
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I continued and I needed to have paintings to put up on the wall.

174
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:13,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a few, but not anything substantial.

175
00:13:14,353 --> 00:13:19,315
[SPEAKER_04]: So after the Danvers show, I started really painting a lot.

176
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:22,776
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of my favorites.

177
00:13:23,276 --> 00:13:26,817
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you see, almost the same colors as the first one.

178
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:34,120
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I brought it, to show you that you can use almost the same color, except this is gold.

179
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:41,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there was an orangey gold, and black, and teal, which I love, I guess.

180
00:13:41,122 --> 00:13:45,104
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the same cop, different layers.

181
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:45,484
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

182
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:52,247
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I did know, so on this one, I actually, and you could do it many ways, the way you like it.

183
00:13:52,307 --> 00:13:54,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually asked my Facebook friend

184
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:59,226
[SPEAKER_04]: art group, which way should I do this?

185
00:13:59,786 --> 00:14:02,668
[SPEAKER_04]: And we all agreed this was the way, but you can't change this.

186
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:10,312
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this one, I actually just mixed the certain colors and I poured it over the canvas, okay?

187
00:14:10,952 --> 00:14:17,516
[SPEAKER_04]: And in different shapes and sizes of thinness of it, thickness of the lines.

188
00:14:19,537 --> 00:14:26,723
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I took black and I swiped it with a piece of paper Oh, okay.

189
00:14:27,044 --> 00:14:46,460
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you just swipe it and what happens is the black is opaque And the colors are not and I did their transport they call transparent So what I did with this one is I put a little bit of treadmill oil in the other colors aside from black so that when you

190
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:58,666
[SPEAKER_04]: when you take the paper or whatever object you want and go across the paint, then all of the oils will come out of it.

191
00:14:58,806 --> 00:15:03,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the black is opaque, it has the paint peep through.

192
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:08,011
[SPEAKER_04]: So then, that was okay, but it was black and teal.

193
00:15:08,612 --> 00:15:10,313
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm starting to like gold a lot.

194
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:15,657
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said you have a journal where you're writing all these experiments.

195
00:15:15,777 --> 00:15:16,598
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not.

196
00:15:17,018 --> 00:15:17,919
[SPEAKER_00]: But you should, you know.

197
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:21,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I should be doing that because there are a lot of things I forget.

198
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:30,627
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because when I teach the silk painting, and I encourage students to experiment.

199
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:33,229
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I said, don't forget to write.

200
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,871
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you do in this particular one?

201
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:43,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you want to repeat, just pull the card or whatever, the notebook, and you found this one.

202
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:46,557
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, take a picture, put it next to it.

203
00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:49,259
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did that when I was doing my journaling.

204
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:56,083
[SPEAKER_04]: in my journal, and when I look back at it now, it was really quite awful and quite ugly.

205
00:15:56,844 --> 00:16:01,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really thought with each page I did I was getting better, but I wasn't.

206
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,489
[SPEAKER_04]: But I feel now I have.

207
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:10,233
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I did then was I took gold paint, I mixed it up, and I have some favorite paints.

208
00:16:10,754 --> 00:16:16,438
[SPEAKER_04]: This was not one of my favorite gold paints, but it worked well for this particular

209
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,744
[SPEAKER_04]: So then I thought, well what would happen if I put some gold on there and then swipe that too.

210
00:16:23,364 --> 00:16:26,327
[SPEAKER_04]: What I did was I used a palette knife this time.

211
00:16:26,427 --> 00:16:27,848
[SPEAKER_04]: So I could start and stop.

212
00:16:27,969 --> 00:16:34,174
[SPEAKER_04]: So I took the gold paint and I put it there and then I could start and stop it.

213
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:37,237
[SPEAKER_04]: So the canvas background was white.

214
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:39,679
[SPEAKER_04]: This canvas was white.

215
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:45,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I brought you something that I poured colors.

216
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:49,969
[SPEAKER_04]: But what you can do is what we call negative space.

217
00:16:50,649 --> 00:17:03,661
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I just want a little bit of color or a little bit of a design, I could pour white paint all over here and then mix up colors or place colors on the canvas.

218
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:09,164
[SPEAKER_04]: That will just cover it a certain amount and leave that negative space.

219
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:16,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see what I did bring here Okay, see if I have anything like that So, of course, I didn't bring it.

220
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:28,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay, but that's okay So we'll be showing your website where you have all the samples and or finished artwork Yeah, I do include the jewelry.

221
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:28,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Also.

222
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:32,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, my website actually has sections so that I have my

223
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,552
[SPEAKER_04]: abstract paintings and my jewelry by category.

224
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:41,053
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, for everybody to see.

225
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:41,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

226
00:17:41,753 --> 00:17:44,674
[SPEAKER_04]: So then I would like to show you this one.

227
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:46,515
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was a swipe.

228
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:47,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

229
00:17:47,655 --> 00:17:51,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And very, I mixed three different colors.

230
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:55,158
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is also a swipe.

231
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:59,382
[SPEAKER_04]: only use two again.

232
00:17:59,582 --> 00:17:59,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

233
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:07,026
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually it looks like teal but it's teal with every other a lot of other colors mixed in and there's gray.

234
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:10,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Every now and then you can see the gray come through.

235
00:18:10,868 --> 00:18:13,690
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wanted this white to come just like that.

236
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,611
[SPEAKER_04]: So after I poured it

237
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:21,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I just poured white or I placed it with my brush and I just put the white there.

238
00:18:21,816 --> 00:18:24,718
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I swipe this way and this way.

239
00:18:24,778 --> 00:18:30,543
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I used this time was a long spatula that you use for frosting a cake.

240
00:18:31,183 --> 00:18:38,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So you learn all these different ways to do things and they don't always come out as you plan.

241
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:43,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Hence, accidental painting.

242
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:55,088
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I like to do now is also, for people that would come to my shows and don't necessarily have wall space.

243
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:06,783
[SPEAKER_04]: particularly want something this size for their wall, it's too big, it's too small, I have taken my art into tiles.

244
00:19:07,603 --> 00:19:26,269
[SPEAKER_04]: So I make coasters, which is all my original art, hot plates, and I just started making these beautiful boxes I call everything or anything box, which are rosewood boxes with a six by six tile, and all those tiles

245
00:19:26,902 --> 00:19:34,853
[SPEAKER_04]: are not only hand painted, but I resin them so that they actually, like the coasters, can be used.

246
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:39,279
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not just for ornamental purposes or, you know, decorative design.

247
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:45,488
[SPEAKER_04]: And those were very well received at the BB show.

248
00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:48,350
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did sell some paintings there.

249
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:57,436
[SPEAKER_04]: So for all intent and purposes, people say I can call myself an artist now, since I've won a ribbon and I sold some paintings.

250
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:02,380
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm feeling really good about it and really excited.

251
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's great.

252
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:08,464
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is one more piece I would like to show you, because when I mentioned the gold.

253
00:20:08,564 --> 00:20:08,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

254
00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:09,324
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

255
00:20:11,338 --> 00:20:16,701
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just one of my very favorites.

256
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:22,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Not sure I'm going to be able to part with this one because I really love that gold.

257
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:27,067
[SPEAKER_04]: And that gold is made by Winsor & Newton.

258
00:20:27,928 --> 00:20:31,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Much more expensive paints that come in a tube.

259
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:34,412
[SPEAKER_04]: that are very thick.

260
00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:36,674
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like how you made this here right around too.

261
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:38,075
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, all the way around.

262
00:20:38,215 --> 00:20:40,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I try to do that and make it be interesting.

263
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:41,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

264
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:44,861
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually use my fingers to do that with.

265
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:46,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for noticing.

266
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:46,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

267
00:20:46,903 --> 00:20:48,264
[SPEAKER_04]: So this I really love.

268
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:54,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've gotten some really good feedback on that.

269
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,951
[SPEAKER_04]: So I actually

270
00:20:57,952 --> 00:21:00,414
[SPEAKER_04]: decided that I would do more, a little more in the gold.

271
00:21:00,434 --> 00:21:05,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if you will be doing bigger frame and push this little forward.

272
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:14,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can do that because I do have some frames, and they do sell them, that are called float frames.

273
00:21:14,886 --> 00:21:17,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Not floating frames, but float frames.

274
00:21:17,748 --> 00:21:22,933
[SPEAKER_04]: So that mostly a lot, well half of this would stick out from the frame.

275
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:24,794
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very gallery worthy.

276
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:25,255
[SPEAKER_04]: This is

277
00:21:25,955 --> 00:21:30,116
[SPEAKER_04]: what they call a gallery wrapped level three canvas.

278
00:21:30,216 --> 00:21:43,661
[SPEAKER_04]: So the price for this in selling is much higher than one that is seven eighths of an inch level one gallery.

279
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:45,461
[SPEAKER_04]: But it all depends what somebody wants.

280
00:21:46,902 --> 00:21:52,103
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what I'm going for is what intrigues me, what comes out of me.

281
00:21:52,163 --> 00:21:53,304
[SPEAKER_04]: When I look at the canvas,

282
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew what I wanted to do with this.

283
00:21:57,026 --> 00:22:01,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say to incorporate red the way I wanted it to come.

284
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably poured six.

285
00:22:05,132 --> 00:22:06,874
[SPEAKER_04]: That came up, just did not work.

286
00:22:07,294 --> 00:22:09,216
[SPEAKER_04]: They went into the black.

287
00:22:10,517 --> 00:22:22,966
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, my daughter, my granddaughter, just moved to a new house, and she asked me for a red, a black, and a white painting, those three colors.

288
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:25,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done two.

289
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:27,348
[SPEAKER_04]: They came maroon and gray.

290
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:30,330
[SPEAKER_04]: So back to the drawing board on those.

291
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:35,432
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a lot of experimenting, a lot of feeling.

292
00:22:35,732 --> 00:22:42,635
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot, I think you commented on one of mine that they kind of look

293
00:22:43,415 --> 00:22:47,037
[SPEAKER_04]: you know like they're part of celestial part of the sky.

294
00:22:47,077 --> 00:22:48,738
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm trying to do a lot more of those.

295
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:50,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah it's like cosmic.

296
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:51,840
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's from space.

297
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the surface of planets.

298
00:22:55,302 --> 00:22:56,663
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pictures from NASA.

299
00:22:56,763 --> 00:22:57,924
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to do that.

300
00:22:58,384 --> 00:23:02,787
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm practicing on some birch circles to do it.

301
00:23:02,827 --> 00:23:05,588
[SPEAKER_04]: They're inexpensive and so I can practice on those.

302
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:07,349
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is canvas also?

303
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:08,250
[SPEAKER_04]: This is canvas.

304
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you try on the wood?

305
00:23:10,111 --> 00:23:20,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so I do have a wood panelist on my website and it's an 11 by 14 and it's called cradled because it's this thick on the sides.

306
00:23:21,243 --> 00:23:22,585
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that thick on the sides.

307
00:23:26,148 --> 00:23:29,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you have to prep it differently than you would a canvas.

308
00:23:30,031 --> 00:23:39,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I buy my canvases and they have three coats of gesso on it, which is a great primer, and it works.

309
00:23:39,297 --> 00:23:40,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to put any more on.

310
00:23:41,498 --> 00:23:43,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Wood, I do two or three coats.

311
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I sand it in between so that you don't have that fuzz sticking up.

312
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,340
[SPEAKER_04]: You still want the paint to adhere to the wood.

313
00:23:52,581 --> 00:24:01,683
[SPEAKER_04]: And so one I have on my website is called Running River, and it, to me, looks like the sand underneath the water.

314
00:24:02,463 --> 00:24:03,744
[SPEAKER_04]: the river flowing down.

315
00:24:05,105 --> 00:24:15,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I just finished a resin on a cradled wood which is an 8x8 and I did put it in a float frame.

316
00:24:17,473 --> 00:24:19,274
[SPEAKER_04]: and it kind of looks very cosmic.

317
00:24:19,754 --> 00:24:35,719
[SPEAKER_04]: I used all metallics, copper and gold and rose gold and on black, a black background on the wooden surface and mixed the resin with paints.

318
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:41,201
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually a powdered mica, a mica powder and

319
00:24:42,821 --> 00:24:48,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Resin is a very tricky thing to do and it's very sticky if you don't mix it well.

320
00:24:49,463 --> 00:24:53,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I used it a lot with my tiles and it worked really well.

321
00:24:54,145 --> 00:24:55,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have a problem.

322
00:24:55,646 --> 00:24:57,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the first couple of times you do have a problem.

323
00:24:57,866 --> 00:25:00,788
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to get used to mixing it well and pouring it.

324
00:25:02,488 --> 00:25:30,275
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very different on paintings when you're using different types of paints acrylics or powders So some of the powders if you don't mix them well enough will clump In the resin and then you've just ruined something and it's very expensive to use resin But the one I did I love it really came out very you probably can do this on Glass I have poured on glass.

325
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:31,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two one

326
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:46,604
[SPEAKER_04]: One is called The Monster, and I did put black on the background, and shades of browns, beige, and gold, and I think a little copper in there, with a negative space.

327
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:50,326
[SPEAKER_04]: And it did not come out as I planned.

328
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,562
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not one of my favorites, but quite a few people love it because it's odd.

329
00:25:58,222 --> 00:25:59,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, everyone has different tastes.

330
00:25:59,782 --> 00:26:01,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, everybody does.

331
00:26:01,823 --> 00:26:08,845
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's interesting to me to say, oh, I don't like that one or whatever.

332
00:26:08,885 --> 00:26:11,626
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not what I wanted, but somebody else might want it.

333
00:26:12,926 --> 00:26:18,308
[SPEAKER_04]: But on the bottom side of anything, it comes from you.

334
00:26:18,408 --> 00:26:18,748
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mine.

335
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:23,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not happy with it.

336
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,712
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very hard for me to present that to the public.

337
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,055
[SPEAKER_04]: But like you say, somebody else might like it.

338
00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:33,197
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm very fussy.

339
00:26:34,237 --> 00:26:35,698
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'll just do it over.

340
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,360
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the nicest thing about acrylic paint.

341
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,341
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like oils.

342
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:44,784
[SPEAKER_04]: that I can actually prep the canvas again and pour over it.

343
00:26:44,924 --> 00:26:46,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I have quite a few I've done that with.

344
00:26:46,985 --> 00:26:47,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

345
00:26:47,705 --> 00:26:48,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been so much happier.

346
00:26:48,766 --> 00:26:51,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well it reminds me of this Japanese technique.

347
00:26:51,808 --> 00:26:53,168
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Saminaguchi.

348
00:26:53,368 --> 00:26:53,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

349
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:56,610
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you put the ink in the water.

350
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:57,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

351
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,352
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're doing whatever and then you put over the paper.

352
00:27:00,372 --> 00:27:00,953
[SPEAKER_00]: The paper.

353
00:27:01,013 --> 00:27:04,735
[SPEAKER_00]: And then pull it out and it could be abstract whatever.

354
00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:05,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

355
00:27:05,835 --> 00:27:06,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

356
00:27:06,536 --> 00:27:24,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of the challenge to some of these are, if you, and I didn't bring one like that, if you just did what they call, you can do a flip cup or a poured cup, okay?

357
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:33,473
[SPEAKER_04]: And the difference being, once you level your paint, you could take, by the way, you could take two containers and fill them exactly the same.

358
00:27:34,794 --> 00:27:38,896
[SPEAKER_04]: And then pour them on the canvas and you wouldn't recognize one from the other.

359
00:27:38,936 --> 00:27:40,317
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't look anything alike.

360
00:27:40,977 --> 00:27:42,318
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to master.

361
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:42,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

362
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:46,981
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to master manipulation of that once it hits the canvas.

363
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:52,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a challenge all the time because usually you love what comes out of the cup.

364
00:27:52,484 --> 00:27:54,145
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, this is gorgeous.

365
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:57,827
[SPEAKER_04]: If it stayed that way, this big, you would love it.

366
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:03,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you move it, you sometimes have to tilt it so that you lose the best part.

367
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:15,914
[SPEAKER_04]: or you have too much of one color and you're trying to get rid of it and when you do that the other side comes out like just blah and so that's a repour.

368
00:28:16,254 --> 00:28:17,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you planning to teach?

369
00:28:17,315 --> 00:28:19,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to.

370
00:28:19,716 --> 00:28:23,717
[SPEAKER_04]: When I feel that I know it well enough to explain it

371
00:28:24,017 --> 00:28:44,237
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah well to people um a lot of people on my facebook groups are doing that now and it's so exciting however um when people don't make a nice painting they're kind of upset and so uh i you know just like when i taught jewelry i never had a

372
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,143
[SPEAKER_04]: of anybody who didn't like what they made at the end of the class.

373
00:28:50,643 --> 00:28:53,626
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would like to be able to get to a point.

374
00:28:53,706 --> 00:28:53,906
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

375
00:28:54,226 --> 00:28:55,648
[SPEAKER_04]: You liked what you made?

376
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:56,889
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's what I meant to say.

377
00:28:56,929 --> 00:28:57,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

378
00:28:57,729 --> 00:29:01,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody ever complained that they didn't like what they made.

379
00:29:01,613 --> 00:29:04,936
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess I hoped it was my teaching ability.

380
00:29:05,476 --> 00:29:07,358
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think I could teach.

381
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:15,305
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I need more knowledge and experience myself before I could actually charge somebody.

382
00:29:15,465 --> 00:29:21,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well tell all you is how you feel when you creating something?

383
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:34,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I have I actually Okay, and then don't mean to be you know in a sad frame of mind, but as you well know I had a health problem and

384
00:29:35,585 --> 00:29:41,708
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just felt like, oh my God, I can't be me anymore.

385
00:29:42,368 --> 00:29:43,308
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I gonna do?

386
00:29:43,328 --> 00:29:45,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't do the same things.

387
00:29:45,129 --> 00:29:47,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't, whatever.

388
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:57,794
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I started looking into myself and I said, okay, so you can express yourself in a blue, low mood.

389
00:29:58,235 --> 00:29:59,095
[SPEAKER_04]: My life is over.

390
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,548
[SPEAKER_04]: or you can do something about it, and I'm a fighter.

391
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:08,613
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's when I started going on YouTube and said, okay, what can I do?

392
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:12,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I physically can't do yoga anymore.

393
00:30:12,135 --> 00:30:16,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I physically can't do a lot of things anymore, but there's things I can do.

394
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:19,822
[SPEAKER_04]: That used my mind and thought about my jewelry and

395
00:30:20,954 --> 00:30:22,936
[SPEAKER_04]: what I called the designs in mind.

396
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:26,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I thought well I might have other designs in my mind.

397
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:26,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

398
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:31,465
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I went on YouTube like I said just looking and looking and I started.

399
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:37,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I started journaling, I started learning about things, I started to do this.

400
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:39,814
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's go roll back.

401
00:30:40,495 --> 00:30:42,537
[SPEAKER_04]: The PMC, how that start?

402
00:30:43,563 --> 00:30:51,588
[SPEAKER_04]: That started, well let's see, I was beading, I started beading in about 2000 and just for myself to make jewelry.

403
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:54,290
[SPEAKER_04]: And just because you retired about that time?

404
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,591
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, I was still working.

405
00:30:55,611 --> 00:30:56,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're still working.

406
00:30:56,472 --> 00:31:08,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I was still working, I was working in a pharmaceutical company actually right here in Medford and I wore a bracelet to work one day and I was doing crystals at that time and one of the girls said,

407
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,981
[SPEAKER_04]: That's beautiful.

408
00:31:10,021 --> 00:31:10,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did you get it?

409
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,124
[SPEAKER_04]: I made it.

410
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:13,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you make me one?

411
00:31:14,026 --> 00:31:14,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Started.

412
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:23,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time I wore a piece of jewelry, this one girl, Jennifer, her name is, would buy something for me or order something special in colors.

413
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:27,622
[SPEAKER_04]: So everybody in the office kind of said, wow, where'd you get that?

414
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:39,996
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started making a lot of beaded things, mostly crystals and very light types of things and I found out about West Medford Open Studios.

415
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:43,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody said to me, you should sell your jewelry there, it's beautiful.

416
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,286
[SPEAKER_04]: So I applied and I got accepted and the very first year

417
00:31:50,627 --> 00:31:57,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in a house on the second floor, and I forget the name of the street.

418
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:04,978
[SPEAKER_04]: A lovely woman and her two daughters welcomed me and told me, you can use my dining room table.

419
00:32:05,018 --> 00:32:06,579
[SPEAKER_04]: They had already put a cloth for me.

420
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,962
[SPEAKER_04]: And I started to put my jewelry up and they're like, don't you have any prices?

421
00:32:13,842 --> 00:32:15,963
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, oh, you mean people are going to buy it?

422
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:21,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was just like to meet the artist and talk about it, whatever.

423
00:32:21,204 --> 00:32:23,245
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said, oh no, people buy things.

424
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:27,626
[SPEAKER_04]: So I quickly took pieces of paper and wrote prices.

425
00:32:27,686 --> 00:32:29,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have business cards, I didn't have anything.

426
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:38,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the end of the day, I mean, people were, wow, those colors, they're beautiful.

427
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:41,403
[SPEAKER_04]: What made you put those together?

428
00:32:41,824 --> 00:32:43,406
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was so happy.

429
00:32:43,426 --> 00:32:45,089
[SPEAKER_04]: I sold quite a few things.

430
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,474
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went home, and I called my best friend, and I said, they liked me.

431
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:51,695
[SPEAKER_04]: They really liked me.

432
00:32:52,356 --> 00:32:53,476
[SPEAKER_04]: And she said, OK.

433
00:32:54,157 --> 00:33:01,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I went back the next day, and almost closing, a woman came rushing into me and said, I have this top.

434
00:33:01,263 --> 00:33:03,605
[SPEAKER_04]: My son's getting married in three weeks in New York.

435
00:33:03,645 --> 00:33:05,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you make me something to go with this?

436
00:33:05,987 --> 00:33:07,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, you're kidding, right?

437
00:33:07,628 --> 00:33:10,129
[SPEAKER_04]: I had never made a commissioned piece, really.

438
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:14,212
[SPEAKER_04]: She actually gave me some of her grandmother's beads.

439
00:33:15,612 --> 00:33:19,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I made three different pieces using some of hers and some of mine.

440
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:22,917
[SPEAKER_04]: She let me keep the top to work with.

441
00:33:23,557 --> 00:33:28,240
[SPEAKER_04]: And she came to my house two days before leaving from New York.

442
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:35,483
[SPEAKER_04]: bought the piece to match her top, and bought the other two pieces to give as gifts to the bridesmaids.

443
00:33:36,543 --> 00:33:39,024
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, okay, I'm doing this.

444
00:33:39,724 --> 00:33:41,565
[SPEAKER_04]: So I beaded for 10 years.

445
00:33:42,545 --> 00:33:46,087
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I just sort of said, I'm kind of running out of ideas.

446
00:33:46,747 --> 00:33:54,110
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went to the bead shop in Lexington, where I bought most of my beads when not online.

447
00:33:55,262 --> 00:34:09,668
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were offering these classes and I saw this beautiful silver jewelry and it said, this is a lump of clay that makes this beautiful jewelry and it was a picture.

448
00:34:10,388 --> 00:34:13,889
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, oh my God, I have to learn how to do this now.

449
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:14,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Took one class.

450
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,731
[SPEAKER_04]: made a really nice piece, which I sold recently.

451
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:23,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't put it out for a while because that was my first one, but I did sell it recently.

452
00:34:24,053 --> 00:34:31,257
[SPEAKER_04]: And went home, bought books, DVDs, YouTube, and whatever, and I went into business.

453
00:34:31,617 --> 00:34:32,077
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it.

454
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:36,759
[SPEAKER_04]: So that year when I did West Medford Open Studios, I did some and some.

455
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:39,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Some beaded, some silver.

456
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,742
[SPEAKER_04]: What year is that?

457
00:34:40,762 --> 00:34:41,283
[SPEAKER_00]: That was 2010.

458
00:34:41,644 --> 00:34:41,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

459
00:34:41,924 --> 00:34:42,144
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, 2010.

460
00:34:51,902 --> 00:34:55,864
[SPEAKER_04]: A woman came to me and said, oh, is this metal clay?

461
00:34:55,884 --> 00:34:56,544
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, yeah.

462
00:34:57,224 --> 00:34:59,525
[SPEAKER_04]: She said, oh, I took this class.

463
00:34:59,845 --> 00:35:04,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I lived in California, and they're so advanced, there's none here.

464
00:35:04,887 --> 00:35:07,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody I know makes this stuff.

465
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to intensive, month-long

466
00:35:12,014 --> 00:35:15,157
[SPEAKER_04]: classes and nothing I made came out good.

467
00:35:16,398 --> 00:35:19,000
[SPEAKER_04]: So she said, would you be willing to teach me?

468
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,643
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought, oh my God, I've never taught this.

469
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:24,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you're saying to me, can I teach?

470
00:35:24,765 --> 00:35:25,286
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

471
00:35:25,446 --> 00:35:27,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I know my stuff, but can I teach?

472
00:35:27,968 --> 00:35:29,169
[SPEAKER_04]: But did I know my stuff?

473
00:35:29,249 --> 00:35:29,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I just started.

474
00:35:33,613 --> 00:35:39,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Marika, she's a very lovely girl, and another woman at that time that I knew was a beater, was interested.

475
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:46,427
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had my first class in my living room, and she loved what she made.

476
00:35:47,068 --> 00:35:50,391
[SPEAKER_04]: She's taken, oh, maybe six or seven classes from me.

477
00:35:53,174 --> 00:36:06,810
[SPEAKER_04]: So after the Mystic Art Gallery closed and I stopped doing the classes there, I turned my spare room into a workshop and bought all kinds of things so that I could continue to teach.

478
00:36:07,391 --> 00:36:09,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And I taught quite a few classes still.

479
00:36:10,874 --> 00:36:15,356
[SPEAKER_04]: just stopped when I started painting, but now I've had three requests.

480
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:17,577
[SPEAKER_04]: When are you going to do the next class?

481
00:36:18,238 --> 00:36:27,142
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm thinking I'm going to have March and April free because I didn't mention to you starting the beginning of March

482
00:36:27,842 --> 00:36:32,703
[SPEAKER_04]: My artwork is going to be in the new gallery at the Medford Public Library.

483
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:33,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

484
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:41,386
[SPEAKER_04]: So they opened it last fall and I've been asked to... Is that only just for show or sale also?

485
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, yeah.

486
00:36:43,587 --> 00:36:45,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I am planning to have a reception.

487
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:46,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a date yet.

488
00:36:47,088 --> 00:36:49,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to talk to the powers that be.

489
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:54,690
[SPEAKER_00]: And then... I think another option is multicultural center in Cambridge.

490
00:36:55,569 --> 00:36:56,410
[SPEAKER_00]: You should apply for that.

491
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

492
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Kaiserschule exhibit will be there.

493
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.

494
00:37:01,712 --> 00:37:01,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

495
00:37:02,352 --> 00:37:05,394
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm doing the Mellows Arts Festival the end of April.

496
00:37:06,094 --> 00:37:08,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, at Memorial Hall.

497
00:37:08,235 --> 00:37:09,396
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great take.

498
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:14,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you've been there visiting me many times, but I'll be doing my artwork.

499
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:21,481
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in May, I'll be at Mr. Coffee Roasters on the walls where you can have your coffee.

500
00:37:21,521 --> 00:37:22,962
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see my artwork there.

501
00:37:24,262 --> 00:37:32,386
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I feel brave that I ventured out and have actually applied and asked people and they like it.

502
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:36,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I'm your admirer and I like people who are creating.

503
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,329
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go back.

504
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:40,730
[SPEAKER_00]: So it didn't start from nowhere.

505
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously your parents

506
00:37:44,092 --> 00:37:45,633
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'll tell you where it started.

507
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:49,956
[SPEAKER_04]: When you have children and you get involved in the school.

508
00:37:50,116 --> 00:37:58,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had a very small grammar school up by Tufts and I lived on the hillside of Medford for many years.

509
00:37:59,503 --> 00:38:08,888
[SPEAKER_04]: And so my children went to the school there and the teachers actually didn't have budgets for books and things like that.

510
00:38:09,448 --> 00:38:18,033
[SPEAKER_04]: So my daughter read at home when she was four and she went to first grade and these books were 12 years old.

511
00:38:19,794 --> 00:38:28,900
[SPEAKER_04]: But by law in Massachusetts the books can be no older than six years old in the new writings, the new editions in other words.

512
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,363
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were reading books that probably I had when I was a kid.

513
00:38:33,043 --> 00:38:35,405
[SPEAKER_04]: So the teacher said, we have no money.

514
00:38:36,305 --> 00:38:37,986
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said, how about if we run a fair?

515
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:39,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I had never done that either.

516
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I masterminded this thing and got some parents together.

517
00:38:45,982 --> 00:38:52,404
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually formed a group called TAP, Teachers and Parents, instead of PTA that we didn't have to pay to register.

518
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:56,084
[SPEAKER_04]: So I decided we needed a big raffle item.

519
00:38:56,725 --> 00:38:59,485
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we had like Christmas, it was gonna be a Christmas fair.

520
00:38:59,885 --> 00:39:02,306
[SPEAKER_04]: We were gonna make all these lovely little Christmas things.

521
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,987
[SPEAKER_04]: So quilts, never made a quilt either.

522
00:39:05,627 --> 00:39:07,887
[SPEAKER_04]: So I looked up some designs that were easy.

523
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:09,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I drew one out.

524
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:19,317
[SPEAKER_04]: picked the colors, gave each of the women the colors and the design to put together, so sewing a whole strip.

525
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:29,425
[SPEAKER_04]: We did strips each and then we sat and put it all together into the backing, like a little sewing bee, quilting bee, and we raffled that off.

526
00:39:30,085 --> 00:39:44,212
[SPEAKER_04]: and the money we made between the raffling of the quilt and all of the Christmas table that we did, we made enough money to buy books for the first and second grades.

527
00:39:44,652 --> 00:39:47,554
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the school system would not let us

528
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:51,617
[SPEAKER_04]: give the money to the teachers to buy the books.

529
00:39:52,478 --> 00:39:53,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It was against the rules.

530
00:39:53,879 --> 00:39:56,781
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went and bought the books and we brought them to the school.

531
00:39:56,801 --> 00:39:59,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I had them delivered to the school from us, a gift.

532
00:40:00,405 --> 00:40:02,386
[SPEAKER_04]: And the teachers were just like overwhelmed.

533
00:40:03,728 --> 00:40:04,608
[SPEAKER_04]: So then people

534
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:11,893
[SPEAKER_04]: So it continued for a while because people that saw the things I made during that Christmas fair.

535
00:40:11,953 --> 00:40:16,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I made holly hobby dolls, tooth fairy pillows, kinds of things like that.

536
00:40:17,077 --> 00:40:19,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Della Robbia wreaths and whatever.

537
00:40:19,758 --> 00:40:22,500
[SPEAKER_04]: So I kind of started a little business on the side.

538
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but where did you learn that?

539
00:40:24,181 --> 00:40:25,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I just taught myself.

540
00:40:25,722 --> 00:40:27,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, self-teaching.

541
00:40:27,683 --> 00:40:31,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my mother was very good at embroidering.

542
00:40:31,987 --> 00:40:35,030
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe, you're making me think way back now.

543
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:38,033
[SPEAKER_04]: My father was a custom upholsterer, okay?

544
00:40:38,453 --> 00:40:41,196
[SPEAKER_04]: So my father could make a chair.

545
00:40:41,716 --> 00:40:43,098
[SPEAKER_04]: You gave him the fabric.

546
00:40:43,938 --> 00:40:48,983
[SPEAKER_04]: So the arm here and the arm here had the same exact flower on it.

547
00:40:49,263 --> 00:40:52,787
[SPEAKER_04]: He matched everything perfectly, every stripe.

548
00:40:53,528 --> 00:41:01,580
[SPEAKER_04]: And when he used to work in our basement two nights a week on his own from his regular job, he would let me make buttons.

549
00:41:02,755 --> 00:41:23,191
[SPEAKER_04]: see now you're making me think where this came from and so there was this little machine and you cut out the fabric and you put a little cotton and then there was a metal bottom and then a top and it was like a press and he was having me make all these beautiful buttons and I would be so proud to say I made the sofa.

550
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:24,852
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, hit all the buttons.

551
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:26,413
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess that's true.

552
00:41:26,774 --> 00:41:31,758
[SPEAKER_04]: My mother, great embroidery, ton of patience with that.

553
00:41:32,238 --> 00:41:43,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And then later on, when she would see me do things, I started making pillows to match like people's bedroom sets and added silk flowers to them.

554
00:41:43,747 --> 00:41:44,948
[SPEAKER_04]: So she started to do some of that.

555
00:41:44,968 --> 00:41:46,189
[SPEAKER_04]: But the flowers, you didn't make it?

556
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:46,629
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

557
00:41:46,689 --> 00:41:48,631
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just bought the flowers.

558
00:41:48,691 --> 00:41:49,832
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just bought it.

559
00:41:50,392 --> 00:41:53,154
[SPEAKER_04]: all, but the fabric and the matching and whatever.

560
00:41:53,454 --> 00:41:55,095
[SPEAKER_04]: And so she started to do that too.

561
00:41:55,215 --> 00:41:58,397
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I guess... So what about your children?

562
00:41:59,657 --> 00:42:00,558
[SPEAKER_04]: The son is a filmmaker.

563
00:42:00,578 --> 00:42:01,558
[SPEAKER_04]: The oldest son is a filmmaker.

564
00:42:01,578 --> 00:42:08,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one son who's a filmmaker and photographer and a musician.

565
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,043
[SPEAKER_04]: He plays several instruments.

566
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:11,604
[SPEAKER_04]: He plays bass and guitar.

567
00:42:11,644 --> 00:42:12,824
[SPEAKER_04]: He has a famous movie.

568
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:14,685
[SPEAKER_04]: He has two movies.

569
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,106
[SPEAKER_04]: One's called May I Be Frank.

570
00:42:17,247 --> 00:42:17,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

571
00:42:17,847 --> 00:42:18,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Great movie.

572
00:42:18,727 --> 00:42:23,290
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still going around the world as far as Australia now.

573
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:31,614
[SPEAKER_04]: And his other film was called Love Bomb, which was another fabulous movie about service and helping people.

574
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:33,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should ask the show on Medford TV3.

575
00:42:34,015 --> 00:42:34,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't that be wonderful?

576
00:42:35,056 --> 00:42:35,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

577
00:42:35,556 --> 00:42:37,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is available for showing now.

578
00:42:39,018 --> 00:42:42,660
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's my oldest son.

579
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:52,946
[SPEAKER_04]: My middle son, Mark, lives in Hilton Head, South Carolina, and he's an electrician and he loves it down there.

580

[SPEAKER_04]: He plays the bass.

588
00:43:07,915 --> 00:43:09,776
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's a musician too.

00:43:09,856 --> 00:43:10,476
[SPEAKER_04]: That's his art.

00:43:25,732 --> 00:43:27,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I sang when I was a young girl.

599
00:43:27,893 --> 00:43:28,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

600
00:43:28,453 --> 00:43:31,275
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was in the Mystic Players here in Medford.

601
00:43:31,335 --> 00:43:31,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

602
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:32,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember you mentioned once.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.

604
00:43:34,076 --> 00:43:36,917

00:43:36,957 --> 00:43:37,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

606
00:43:37,437 --> 00:43:38,838

00:43:54,984 --> 00:43:57,525
[SPEAKER_04]: He loves to do a lot of artwork.

614
00:43:57,605 --> 00:44:03,486
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact for Christmas I bought him a whole set of molding clay because he loves to work with his hands.

615
00:44:03,927 --> 00:44:06,487
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully I'll see some My granddaughter

616
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:13,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, she took dance for about six or seven years and she really loved it.

617
00:44:14,531 --> 00:44:19,853
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's not doing that right now, but nothing really artistic about her.

618
00:44:19,933 --> 00:44:22,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, dance is already art, work also.

619
00:44:23,015 --> 00:44:25,956
[SPEAKER_04]: But not, you know, in drawing, things like that.

620
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:27,437
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they have grandma for that.

621
00:44:27,997 --> 00:44:29,098
[SPEAKER_04]: They do, they do.

622
00:44:29,158 --> 00:44:33,160
[SPEAKER_00]: And a crochet came upon between the PMC and painting.

623
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know.

624
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:43,146
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I, well, I do know it was after my surgery and I was in the house, you know, all winter long and I was like, oh, what am I going to do?

625
00:44:43,226 --> 00:44:44,127
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I going to do?

626
00:44:44,967 --> 00:44:51,671
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know why it even came in my head, but I crocheted years and years ago when my kids were little.

627
00:44:52,291 --> 00:45:00,796
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I looked on YouTube, that's all I can say, and I watched the steps and watched the steps and I still do.

628
00:45:00,816 --> 00:45:02,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you hear about paper clay?

629
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:04,469
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

630
00:45:05,249 --> 00:45:05,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.

631
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:06,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

635
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:09,573
[SPEAKER_00]: And what can you make with it?

636
00:45:09,593 --> 00:45:14,036
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do sculpting or whatever you want to do, a small decoration.

637
00:45:14,196 --> 00:45:14,997
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be my favorite.

638
00:45:15,017 --> 00:45:22,162
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually it can combine with your painting, make it more kind of interesting.

639
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:22,443
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

640
00:45:22,463 --> 00:45:24,124
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two different types of media.

641
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,286
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well,

642
00:45:27,126 --> 00:45:31,169
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very happy that you finally made it because we talked about it a long time ago.

643
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,691
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we did.

644
00:45:32,711 --> 00:45:33,892
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my fault.

645
00:45:34,112 --> 00:45:34,712
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.

00:45:42,278 --> 00:45:45,961
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll see my viewers next time with a new guest.
