1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:11,961
[SPEAKER_01]: And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:15,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:18,382
[SPEAKER_00]: And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:20,723
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:28,905
[SPEAKER_00]: Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,745 --> 00:00:32,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:35,287
[SPEAKER_01]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:48,532
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thanks so much for joining me tonight.

10
00:00:48,612 --> 00:00:52,593
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't mind introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:53,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

12
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:54,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Danielle.

13
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:55,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really excited to be here.

14
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:57,154
[SPEAKER_02]: My name's Mike Mastroboni.

15
00:00:57,174 --> 00:01:01,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a father of two Medford Public Schools kids.

16
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:07,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the budget director for our neighbor down south, Somerville.

17
00:01:07,836 --> 00:01:11,076
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am a first-time candidate for school committee on November 4th.

18
00:01:12,276 --> 00:01:13,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Mike.

19
00:01:13,197 --> 00:01:13,957
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are your pronouns?

20
00:01:14,377 --> 00:01:14,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, he, him.

21
00:01:15,057 --> 00:01:15,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you.

22
00:01:16,748 --> 00:01:28,327
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, before we get into talking about your campaign for school committee, I'm just wondering if you could answer the question that we ask everybody on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

23
00:01:29,802 --> 00:01:33,485
[SPEAKER_02]: So I live in Fulton Heights, so for breakfast for me, it's Jim's Market.

24
00:01:33,565 --> 00:01:37,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I just learned that they have a Taylor Ham b-boy called the J-Boy.

25
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:39,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Strongly recommend that.

26
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Lunch, definitely Tenoch fish tacos.

27
00:01:43,973 --> 00:01:45,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I love their fish tacos.

28
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:47,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Dinner for me, it's Nigea.

29
00:01:48,056 --> 00:01:50,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how that place can do it so consistently.

30
00:01:50,798 --> 00:01:56,302
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I will mention the ghost of Ebisuya, gone but not forgotten.

31
00:01:57,937 --> 00:01:58,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks, Mike.

32
00:01:58,457 --> 00:02:01,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the b-boy is a popular one in our house too.

33
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,681
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are vegetarians, but they will do like a spinach.

34
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:07,083
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually like spinach, egg, cheese, and hash brown.

35
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:07,984
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good.

36
00:02:09,364 --> 00:02:09,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

37
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:10,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so- That sounds awesome.

38
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:11,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

39
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:16,129
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to know that you can be a vegetarian and also eat at gyms.

40
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,033
[SPEAKER_01]: So for tonight, we want to talk a little bit more about your campaign for school committee.

41
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:29,598
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm wondering if we could just start by sharing a little bit with us about what kind of led you to the moment when you decided to run for school committee.

42
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:30,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

43
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:31,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for that.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a little bit of a long story, but my wife, Christina, and I moved to Medford in 2021.

45
00:02:39,705 --> 00:02:42,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Our kids, my son, Lincoln, is seven.

46
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:43,608
[SPEAKER_02]: My daughter, Violet, is four.

47
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:48,785
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be in schools here until, I think, 2038 or 2039, right?

48
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:49,746
[SPEAKER_02]: We are rooted here.

49
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:50,566
[SPEAKER_02]: We are grounded here.

50
00:02:51,427 --> 00:02:53,168
[SPEAKER_02]: We're so excited to be here.

51
00:02:54,909 --> 00:03:08,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Our story is like a lot of folks who came to Boston for college, spent some time there, graduated into a recession, made their way around different neighborhoods of Boston, Cambridge, Somerville.

52
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:11,898
[SPEAKER_02]: We spent 10 years in Somerville before we moved here to Medford.

53
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:23,807
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to find a place where we could really lay our roots, get invested in, have our kids grow up in.

54
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:41,679
[SPEAKER_02]: The coolest part, I think, that I've found about your kids starting school is when my son started kindergarten, your community just totally explodes and you get surrounded by, um, new friends, um, you know, uh, your, your kid's friends.

55
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:46,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you start going to these, these new activities and start making new connections.

56
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:51,122
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, uh, I want to give back to that community.

57
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:55,303
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been thinking about how best can I use my skillset to benefit Medford.

58
00:03:56,083 --> 00:04:01,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've tried a couple things I'm currently on the water and sewer commission, which has been awesome.

59
00:04:01,346 --> 00:04:04,808
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, the next step is to.

60
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,770
[SPEAKER_02]: To get back to that community that's been so great for us.

61
00:04:09,143 --> 00:04:13,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the really great strengths of Medford Public Schools so far.

62
00:04:13,146 --> 00:04:16,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some opportunities, right?

63
00:04:16,028 --> 00:04:17,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gone through the after school lottery.

64
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:21,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had my W's and L's there for sure.

65
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:29,877
[SPEAKER_02]: I've kind of struggled to find the right information or the right app or the right way to contact my teacher because we use 10 different systems.

66
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:33,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I volunteered at PTO events, you know, had a great time there.

67
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:44,464
[SPEAKER_02]: just really, I think, for me, in the time that we're in, my skill set can lend a lot to the school committee.

68
00:04:45,825 --> 00:04:46,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

69
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:47,626
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you.

70
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:57,290
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like experiencing the schools with your kids and sort of wanting to contribute in a way that makes sense for kind of your background.

71
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,252
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the particular skills that you're bringing to or that you would bring to the role of school committee member?

72
00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:03,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

73
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:06,671
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my day job, I'm the budget director for Somerville.

74
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:16,359
[SPEAKER_02]: So what that means is I lead the team that develops and manages our $380 million a year operating budget.

75
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:29,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I help plan ahead through our financial forecast, our 10-year financial outlook, trying to make sure that the future looks bright for the community that I work for.

76
00:05:30,892 --> 00:05:46,343
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also plan for and enable some of the really big capital projects, really big building projects, water and sewer projects, through my municipal finance training and background.

77
00:05:47,797 --> 00:06:00,106
[SPEAKER_02]: A big part of my job is taking complicated financial issues and trying to explain them in plain language, whether that's to our subject matter experts, right, to a transportation expert or a public health expert, to elected officials.

78
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:04,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done trainings and spend a lot of time with our city council and school committee in Somerville.

79
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also to residents.

80
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:12,657
[SPEAKER_02]: So we try and do a lot of, you know, our budget division within finance tries to do a lot of outreach to residents to

81
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:19,424
[SPEAKER_02]: help them understand and engage with municipal finance because it's really complicated and it's really hard.

82
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:30,348
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more residents and colleagues and elected officials understand it, the better we can make good investments together.

83
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:32,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

84
00:06:32,997 --> 00:06:38,638
[SPEAKER_01]: So you manage or you plan the whole budget for the budget for the whole city of Somerville, not just schools.

85
00:06:39,558 --> 00:06:39,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

86
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:42,139
[SPEAKER_02]: So I work on the city side.

87
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:47,900
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a whole finance team on the schools that handle the school's budget.

88
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:57,582
[SPEAKER_02]: But I coordinate across our 60 plus departments with department heads, with finance managers, with our CFO, with our decision team to make sure that

89
00:06:58,622 --> 00:07:03,445
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we're aligning our dollars with the outcomes that we want to see.

90
00:07:03,565 --> 00:07:06,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a really challenging, fun job.

91
00:07:06,347 --> 00:07:15,593
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of at the epicenter of everything, which is what I think what's really cool about municipal finance is it's a skill set that helps everyone.

92
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:20,316
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something you really want to make sure you have as part of your team.

93
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:34,040
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so bringing that, like, what you do at work in your day job to the school committee in Medford, what, what sort of what have you noticed how things are going about how things are going now?

94
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,743
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was sort of your hopes be for the future?

95
00:07:38,048 --> 00:07:42,851
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of things are going really great right now, absolutely.

96
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:53,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really proud of the work that Jenny and Paul, who are both on the school committee, have done on labor negotiations.

97
00:07:53,076 --> 00:07:59,019
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been really, really fantastic in terms of compensating our employees well.

98
00:08:02,345 --> 00:08:06,807
[SPEAKER_02]: we've been able to get community support for two overrides.

99
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:08,128
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

100
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:08,888
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

101
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:10,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, a lot of things are going really well.

102
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:15,251
[SPEAKER_02]: But the things that the school committee is primarily responsible are

103
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,913
[SPEAKER_02]: They're nuts and bolts, they're executive type things.

104
00:08:19,853 --> 00:08:35,518
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm talking labor negotiations, I'm talking approving and developing a budget, hiring a superintendent, outlining the vision for the district, whether that's through strategic planning, thinking long term, or policy, thinking near term.

105
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:43,081
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of that work is the stuff that I do on a day-to-day basis.

106
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:45,402
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope that

107
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:55,465
[SPEAKER_02]: By being on the school committee, by being able to be the biggest cheerleader of Medford public schools out there,

108
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:13,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I can help folks understand school budgets, that they're complex, and how state law, grants, contracts, program evaluation, how all that fits together so that we can again turn our resources into results for our kids and our families and our community.

109
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:16,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think that's foundational.

110
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:20,759
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to really make sure that, before anything else, we're investing in our kids.

111
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:32,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think that's the budget has been something that I that we just hear so much about and there's so many critiques about in Medford and like the, you know, I think over the few over the past few years it's

112
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:38,049
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of listening to people try to be creative with like a pretty small pot of money.

113
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:41,691
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully the the override is helping with that.

114
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,892
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully there's like some continued growth there in different ways.

115
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:53,114
[SPEAKER_01]: But one big project that I think a lot of people are hoping for is like the building of a new high school.

116
00:09:53,174 --> 00:09:57,896
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wonder like where that sort of sits in your future plans or priorities.

117
00:09:59,136 --> 00:09:59,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

118
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:03,638
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Medford High School project is going to be the biggest decision that we're going to make in this generation.

119
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:13,484
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to serve kids of today, it needs to serve kids of the next generation, my seven-year-old and four-year-old, and it's going to have to serve their kids as well.

120
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:19,267
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get this right, and it's something that we really can't compromise on.

121
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:26,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankfully, my entire career in Somerville has been

122
00:10:27,172 --> 00:10:29,373
[SPEAKER_02]: working on some of these really big projects.

123
00:10:30,073 --> 00:10:38,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of my first meetings in Somerville were planning meetings for the Somerville High School renovation project.

124
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:50,163
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a $290 million high school renovation in a challenging environment during COVID.

125
00:10:50,723 --> 00:10:52,104
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a really successful project.

126
00:10:52,144 --> 00:10:54,105
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a school that we're really proud of.

127
00:10:55,729 --> 00:11:00,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to use what I learned there to make sure that we get the best project for Medford.

128
00:11:01,311 --> 00:11:06,674
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that's going to be flexible for the future in a way that our current building is not, right?

129
00:11:06,694 --> 00:11:14,437
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that needs to be accessible and energy efficient in ways that weren't priorities when that original building was built.

130
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:24,142
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be right sized for the future, and it's got to be planned for the long term to protect taxpayers, because the challenge that we're going to face is to fund that.

131
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:26,865
[SPEAKER_02]: a debt exclusion.

132
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:35,568
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think there's any way around building a citywide school project in Massachusetts in 2025 without a debt exclusion.

133
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,268
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need school parents.

134
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,829
[SPEAKER_02]: We need non-school parents.

135
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:43,130
[SPEAKER_02]: We need every voter out there supporting this project.

136
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,050
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got to be the right project for Medford.

137
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,270
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, I think, really huge.

138
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:55,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And my experience having done that in the Somerville High School project, and my experience doing that right now in the Winter Hill High School project,

139
00:11:56,073 --> 00:12:00,856
[SPEAKER_02]: in Somerville is going to be really important for the next couple of years.

140
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:06,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, that's really nice to hear that you've had this like exact experience in a different city.

141
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,399
[SPEAKER_01]: And I imagine part of that

142
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:15,412
[SPEAKER_01]: experience was helping to convince residents of Somerville that this was an important project to invest their money in.

143
00:12:15,773 --> 00:12:24,356
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about this in past episodes about just explaining what a debt exclusion is, but that would be a temporary increase to taxes in order to pay for a big project.

144
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:25,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

145
00:12:25,937 --> 00:12:31,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Different from an override, which would be like a permanent increase in taxes.

146
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,240
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

147
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:33,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

148
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:33,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

149
00:12:34,072 --> 00:12:43,601
[SPEAKER_01]: So aside from the high school, which I think is a huge project, and I think one that lots of people are thinking about as they vote, what are your other sort of thoughts for the future of Medford Public Schools?

150
00:12:45,622 --> 00:12:45,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

151
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:51,107
[SPEAKER_02]: So something that really keeps me up at night is preservation of our progress.

152
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:58,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere you go right now, you listen to NPR, you listen to the radio, you listen to a podcast.

153
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:01,005
[SPEAKER_02]: These are uncertain times.

154
00:13:01,065 --> 00:13:03,447
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know what's going to happen next.

155
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:06,970
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not OK for education.

156
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,391
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not OK for our kids.

157
00:13:09,852 --> 00:13:17,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm worried about federal or state cuts in aid.

158
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:29,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm worried about potential slow pace of development in Medford if we have some economic headwinds not in our control.

159
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Pair that with consistently increasing expectations of our schools.

160
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,042
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to do better every day.

161
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:43,425
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a recipe for risk.

162
00:13:44,505 --> 00:13:47,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of what I do is trying to make sure that we mitigate those risks.

163
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:56,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to work with the public schools administration, the superintendent, the city council, and the mayor to get on the same page about how we're going to approach these risks together.

164
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:59,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that it's helpful for Medford residents

165
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:13,036
[SPEAKER_02]: If the school committee is holding the mayor or the city council is holding the mayor or someone is holding someone hostage, we need to work together because residents rely on what we do.

166
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:28,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to work with city staff to make a sustainable multi-year plan to preserve services, including some kind of planning of what if we lose

167
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:37,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Grant A, what if we lose school lunch funding?

168
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:46,263
[SPEAKER_02]: What if the state drops our Chapter 70 resources for next year because the feds did something to the state?

169
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,065
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the things that keep me up at night.

170
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:59,878
[SPEAKER_02]: We are also in a really, really important opportunity for this upcoming school committee, you know, who are going to be able to hire a superintendent that aligns with our values.

171
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:11,990
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know the superintendent is just so, so critical to the success of the district and we got to hire the right person and then we got to work with them to start thinking strategically about.

172
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:14,308
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we want Medford schools to look like?

173
00:15:14,328 --> 00:15:15,849
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are the steps we got to take to get there?

174
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I want to be thinking ahead.

175
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:32,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be looking around corners and I want to make sure that at the end of the day, it's in service of maintaining the core function of what, what a city does, which is, um, funding school for our kids.

176
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

177
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:45,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think this question came up on, or something similar, a similar topic came up about like the federal landscape and how it's impacting us locally and what we think about the role of the school committee in that.

178
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:51,506
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you're making some great points that are related to finance and how that impacts, you know, the health of the school system.

179
00:15:52,026 --> 00:15:55,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I also wonder about like ideological topics.

180
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:58,428
[SPEAKER_01]: So like how, you know, and, you know, I've heard this phrase like,

181
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:04,171
[SPEAKER_01]: being grateful to be in Massachusetts, but I don't think that's something that we can continue to take for granted.

182
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:21,541
[SPEAKER_01]: We had our preliminary election for city council last week, and there was a surprising outcome in terms of how people were voting for more conservative candidates, candidates that have expressed pretty problematic views about lots of things, in my opinion.

183
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:22,342
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think

184
00:16:24,227 --> 00:16:37,194
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's only like a small role maybe in how the school committee kind of impacts those sorts of things, but I kind of wonder how you think about that, what your hopes are in terms of preserving some of these things.

185
00:16:38,675 --> 00:16:39,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

186
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:42,777
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I consider myself a very, very strong progressive.

187
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:44,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really psyched and fired up.

188
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:50,493
[SPEAKER_02]: to be running with some great new friends with Our Revolution Medford.

189
00:16:52,375 --> 00:17:03,064
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have a really important job to do over the next six or seven weeks here, which is talk to residents about the Medford that we want to see.

190
00:17:04,097 --> 00:17:15,400
[SPEAKER_02]: right, which funds public schools, which fixes streets and sidewalks, which moves us towards more community safety and removes barriers to participation in government.

191
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:27,764
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I wanted to run with those folks is because that vision of what Medford can be is really compelling to me.

192
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that

193
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:54,543
[SPEAKER_02]: We have work to do to make sure that the election goes the way we'd like, but I think in school committee, the way I picture it is think about the team that you want facing challenges that Medford schools are being presented with.

194
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:59,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna make sure that you have

195
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:10,932
[SPEAKER_02]: folks with finance experience, folks with curriculum experience, folks with really, really close knit ties to the students, right?

196
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:13,893
[SPEAKER_02]: You're building a team that's gonna respond to these challenges.

197
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:23,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about how, you know, your vote, who you want on your team with your vote, what you wanna build as a group.

198
00:18:23,197 --> 00:18:27,039
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, just because

199
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:37,507
[SPEAKER_02]: The challenge that I'm really focusing on is the high school and the sustainable investments.

200
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:54,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really fired up to work on a lot of the other issues that we're seeing in the schools, including things like supporting the after-school ecosystem and taking an all-hands approach on figuring out how we build that out with

201
00:18:55,561 --> 00:19:10,974
[SPEAKER_02]: our nonprofit partners, how we improve language access, how we try and get a single point of contact for families to tap into the system.

202
00:19:11,014 --> 00:19:13,896
[SPEAKER_02]: All those kind of concrete things are really exciting as well.

203
00:19:14,357 --> 00:19:19,881
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm fired up to work with a team that has values, that has a vision for what they want Medford to look like.

204
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:24,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure all the candidates are

205
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,571
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe brave enough to put that out there, what they want to see it look like.

206
00:19:30,892 --> 00:19:39,875
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I want to run with these progressive folks who have put a lot of work into making Medford, to improving Medford and making it the place that we all want it to be.

207
00:19:42,836 --> 00:19:48,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other priorities or parts of your platform that we haven't talked about that you want to make sure to mention?

208
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:58,455
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I talk about kind of what team do you want to build for the school committee, you want to kind of piece together skills.

209
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:06,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I think something that's important to always know is that we don't know what challenges we're going to face.

210
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:13,460
[SPEAKER_02]: But what are the core values of the people that you're putting in office who are going to take on the next challenge that we don't know?

211
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,480
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't even imagine what it might be.

212
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:21,622
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I want folks to know is that core values for me are having

213
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:26,249
[SPEAKER_02]: well-resourced classrooms in well-maintained buildings.

214
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I want fairly paid educators and staff.

215
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:37,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I want afterschool programs with capacity, and I want special education that allows Medford kids to stay here in district.

216
00:20:38,658 --> 00:20:43,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've made a lot of progress there, and I wanna keep that going.

217
00:20:47,144 --> 00:20:51,187
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanna bring my skills, my energy, my perspective as a parent

218
00:20:52,250 --> 00:21:01,234
[SPEAKER_02]: as a public servant and hopefully in the future as a member of the school committee to help make that happen and help the community that has really embraced us.

219
00:21:01,314 --> 00:21:03,935
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really looking forward to that.

220
00:21:03,995 --> 00:21:04,895
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been so fun so far.

221
00:21:06,216 --> 00:21:06,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

222
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:07,817
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of exciting ideas.

223
00:21:09,397 --> 00:21:17,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Any ways that people can communicate with you if they want to share their thoughts or places that we can find you if you're doing any events or things like that?

224
00:21:18,352 --> 00:21:26,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Best way to reach me is MikeMastroboni.com, M-I-K-E, and then Mastroboni is M-A-S-T-R-O-B-U-O-N-I.

225
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:35,047

[SPEAKER_02]: My email is also Mike4Medford at gmail.com.

228
00:21:41,711 --> 00:21:44,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned so much canvassing.

229
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:49,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize that our community was so full of teachers with so much great experience and so many great ideas.

230
00:21:49,735 --> 00:21:51,857
[SPEAKER_02]: They've all been willing to chat with me about stuff.

231
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:57,240
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got questions or you want to talk about something, just shoot me an email and hope I can earn your vote on November 4th.

232
00:21:59,316 --> 00:21:59,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks, Mike.

233
00:21:59,977 --> 00:22:01,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else before we wrap up?

234
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much, Janet.

235
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate you.

00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:06,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks to the volunteers, everybody who's out there, everybody who's voting.

237
00:22:07,248 --> 00:22:09,471
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Medford politics is so much fun.

238
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:11,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Mike.
