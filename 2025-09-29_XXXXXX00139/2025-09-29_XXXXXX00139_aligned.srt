1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,080
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:11,961
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:15,342
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:18,382
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:20,723
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:28,905
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,745 --> 00:00:32,786
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:35,287
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:48,532
All right, thanks so much for joining me tonight.

10
00:00:48,612 --> 00:00:52,593
If you don't mind introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:53,913
Sure.

12
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:54,533
Thanks, Danielle.

13
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:55,854
I'm really excited to be here.

14
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:57,154
My name's Mike Mastroboni.

15
00:00:57,174 --> 00:01:01,535
I am a father of two Medford Public Schools kids.

16
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:07,075
I'm the budget director for our neighbor down south, Somerville.

17
00:01:07,836 --> 00:01:11,076
And I am a first-time candidate for school committee on November 4th.

18
00:01:12,276 --> 00:01:13,037
Thanks, Mike.

19
00:01:13,197 --> 00:01:13,957
And what are your pronouns?

20
00:01:14,377 --> 00:01:14,917
Sure, he, him.

21
00:01:15,057 --> 00:01:15,477
Yes, thank you.

22
00:01:16,748 --> 00:01:28,327
So yeah, before we get into talking about your campaign for school committee, I'm just wondering if you could answer the question that we ask everybody on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

23
00:01:29,802 --> 00:01:33,485
So I live in Fulton Heights, so for breakfast for me, it's Jim's Market.

24
00:01:33,565 --> 00:01:37,828
I just learned that they have a Taylor Ham b-boy called the J-Boy.

25
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:39,049
Strongly recommend that.

26
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,893
Lunch, definitely Tenoch fish tacos.

27
00:01:43,973 --> 00:01:45,354
I love their fish tacos.

28
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:47,976
Dinner for me, it's Nigea.

29
00:01:48,056 --> 00:01:50,778
I don't know how that place can do it so consistently.

30
00:01:50,798 --> 00:01:56,302
And then I will mention the ghost of Ebisuya, gone but not forgotten.

31
00:01:57,937 --> 00:01:58,437
Well, thanks, Mike.

32
00:01:58,457 --> 00:02:01,419
Yeah, the b-boy is a popular one in our house too.

33
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,681
But we are vegetarians, but they will do like a spinach.

34
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:07,083
I usually like spinach, egg, cheese, and hash brown.

35
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:07,984
It's so good.

36
00:02:09,364 --> 00:02:09,645
Thank you.

37
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:10,785
Okay, so- That sounds awesome.

38
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:11,426
Yeah.

39
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:16,129
It's great to know that you can be a vegetarian and also eat at gyms.

40
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,033
So for tonight, we want to talk a little bit more about your campaign for school committee.

41
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:29,598
So I'm wondering if we could just start by sharing a little bit with us about what kind of led you to the moment when you decided to run for school committee.

42
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:30,759
Sure.

43
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:31,459
Thanks for that.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,525
And it's a little bit of a long story, but my wife, Christina, and I moved to Medford in 2021.

45
00:02:39,705 --> 00:02:42,187
Our kids, my son, Lincoln, is seven.

46
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:43,608
My daughter, Violet, is four.

47
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:48,785
They're going to be in schools here until, I think, 2038 or 2039, right?

48
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:49,746
We are rooted here.

49
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:50,566
We are grounded here.

50
00:02:51,427 --> 00:02:53,168
We're so excited to be here.

51
00:02:54,909 --> 00:03:08,256
Our story is like a lot of folks who came to Boston for college, spent some time there, graduated into a recession, made their way around different neighborhoods of Boston, Cambridge, Somerville.

52
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:11,898
We spent 10 years in Somerville before we moved here to Medford.

53
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:23,807
We wanted to find a place where we could really lay our roots, get invested in, have our kids grow up in.

54
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:41,679
The coolest part, I think, that I've found about your kids starting school is when my son started kindergarten, your community just totally explodes and you get surrounded by, um, new friends, um, you know, uh, your, your kid's friends.

55
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:46,601
Um, and you start going to these, these new activities and start making new connections.

56
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:51,122
And for me, uh, I want to give back to that community.

57
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:55,303
I've been thinking about how best can I use my skillset to benefit Medford.

58
00:03:56,083 --> 00:04:01,046
Um, I've tried a couple things I'm currently on the water and sewer commission, which has been awesome.

59
00:04:01,346 --> 00:04:04,808
But for me, the next step is to.

60
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,770
To get back to that community that's been so great for us.

61
00:04:09,143 --> 00:04:13,126
I've seen the really great strengths of Medford Public Schools so far.

62
00:04:13,146 --> 00:04:16,008
I've seen some opportunities, right?

63
00:04:16,028 --> 00:04:17,569
I've gone through the after school lottery.

64
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:21,411
I've had my W's and L's there for sure.

65
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:29,877
I've kind of struggled to find the right information or the right app or the right way to contact my teacher because we use 10 different systems.

66
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:33,699
I volunteered at PTO events, you know, had a great time there.

67
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:44,464
just really, I think, for me, in the time that we're in, my skill set can lend a lot to the school committee.

68
00:04:45,825 --> 00:04:46,165
Thank you.

69
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:47,626
And thank you.

70
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:57,290
So it sounds like experiencing the schools with your kids and sort of wanting to contribute in a way that makes sense for kind of your background.

71
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,252
What are the particular skills that you're bringing to or that you would bring to the role of school committee member?

72
00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:03,568
Sure.

73
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:06,671
So in my day job, I'm the budget director for Somerville.

74
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:16,359
So what that means is I lead the team that develops and manages our $380 million a year operating budget.

75
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:29,410
I help plan ahead through our financial forecast, our 10-year financial outlook, trying to make sure that the future looks bright for the community that I work for.

76
00:05:30,892 --> 00:05:46,343
And I also plan for and enable some of the really big capital projects, really big building projects, water and sewer projects, through my municipal finance training and background.

77
00:05:47,797 --> 00:06:00,106
A big part of my job is taking complicated financial issues and trying to explain them in plain language, whether that's to our subject matter experts, right, to a transportation expert or a public health expert, to elected officials.

78
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:04,390
I've done trainings and spend a lot of time with our city council and school committee in Somerville.

79
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,552
And then also to residents.

80
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:12,657
So we try and do a lot of, you know, our budget division within finance tries to do a lot of outreach to residents to

81
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:19,424
help them understand and engage with municipal finance because it's really complicated and it's really hard.

82
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:30,348
And the more residents and colleagues and elected officials understand it, the better we can make good investments together.

83
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:32,977
Wow.

84
00:06:32,997 --> 00:06:38,638
So you manage or you plan the whole budget for the budget for the whole city of Somerville, not just schools.

85
00:06:39,558 --> 00:06:39,738
Yes.

86
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:42,139
So I work on the city side.

87
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:47,900
So we have a whole finance team on the schools that handle the school's budget.

88
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:57,582
But I coordinate across our 60 plus departments with department heads, with finance managers, with our CFO, with our decision team to make sure that

89
00:06:58,622 --> 00:07:03,445
you know, we're aligning our dollars with the outcomes that we want to see.

90
00:07:03,565 --> 00:07:06,327
So it's a really challenging, fun job.

91
00:07:06,347 --> 00:07:15,593
You're kind of at the epicenter of everything, which is what I think what's really cool about municipal finance is it's a skill set that helps everyone.

92
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:20,316
And it's something you really want to make sure you have as part of your team.

93
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:34,040
So, so bringing that, like, what you do at work in your day job to the school committee in Medford, what, what sort of what have you noticed how things are going about how things are going now?

94
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,743
And what was sort of your hopes be for the future?

95
00:07:38,048 --> 00:07:42,851
So a lot of things are going really great right now, absolutely.

96
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:53,016
I'm really proud of the work that Jenny and Paul, who are both on the school committee, have done on labor negotiations.

97
00:07:53,076 --> 00:07:59,019
That's been really, really fantastic in terms of compensating our employees well.

98
00:08:02,345 --> 00:08:06,807
we've been able to get community support for two overrides.

99
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:08,128
That's great.

100
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:08,888
That's awesome.

101
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:10,789
Like I said, a lot of things are going really well.

102
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:15,251
But the things that the school committee is primarily responsible are

103
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,913
They're nuts and bolts, they're executive type things.

104
00:08:19,853 --> 00:08:35,518
So I'm talking labor negotiations, I'm talking approving and developing a budget, hiring a superintendent, outlining the vision for the district, whether that's through strategic planning, thinking long term, or policy, thinking near term.

105
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:43,081
So a lot of that work is the stuff that I do on a day-to-day basis.

106
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:45,402
So I hope that

107
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:55,465
By being on the school committee, by being able to be the biggest cheerleader of Medford public schools out there,

108
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:13,353
I can help folks understand school budgets, that they're complex, and how state law, grants, contracts, program evaluation, how all that fits together so that we can again turn our resources into results for our kids and our families and our community.

109
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:16,075
Because I think that's foundational.

110
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:20,759
We have to really make sure that, before anything else, we're investing in our kids.

111
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:32,804
Yeah, and I think that's the budget has been something that I that we just hear so much about and there's so many critiques about in Medford and like the, you know, I think over the few over the past few years it's

112
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:38,049
just kind of listening to people try to be creative with like a pretty small pot of money.

113
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:41,691
And hopefully the the override is helping with that.

114
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,892
And hopefully there's like some continued growth there in different ways.

115
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:53,114
But one big project that I think a lot of people are hoping for is like the building of a new high school.

116
00:09:53,174 --> 00:09:57,896
And so I wonder like where that sort of sits in your future plans or priorities.

117
00:09:59,136 --> 00:09:59,477
Absolutely.

118
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:03,638
So the Medford High School project is going to be the biggest decision that we're going to make in this generation.

119
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:13,484
It needs to serve kids of today, it needs to serve kids of the next generation, my seven-year-old and four-year-old, and it's going to have to serve their kids as well.

120
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:19,267
We need to get this right, and it's something that we really can't compromise on.

121
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:26,112
Thankfully, my entire career in Somerville has been

122
00:10:27,172 --> 00:10:29,373
working on some of these really big projects.

123
00:10:30,073 --> 00:10:38,137
Some of my first meetings in Somerville were planning meetings for the Somerville High School renovation project.

124
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:50,163
It was a $290 million high school renovation in a challenging environment during COVID.

125
00:10:50,723 --> 00:10:52,104
And it was a really successful project.

126
00:10:52,144 --> 00:10:54,105
It's a school that we're really proud of.

127
00:10:55,729 --> 00:11:00,051
I want to use what I learned there to make sure that we get the best project for Medford.

128
00:11:01,311 --> 00:11:06,674
That's something that's going to be flexible for the future in a way that our current building is not, right?

129
00:11:06,694 --> 00:11:14,437
It's something that needs to be accessible and energy efficient in ways that weren't priorities when that original building was built.

130
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:24,142
It's got to be right sized for the future, and it's got to be planned for the long term to protect taxpayers, because the challenge that we're going to face is to fund that.

131
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:26,865
a debt exclusion.

132
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:35,568
So I don't think there's any way around building a citywide school project in Massachusetts in 2025 without a debt exclusion.

133
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,268
So we need school parents.

134
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,829
We need non-school parents.

135
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:43,130
We need every voter out there supporting this project.

136
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,050
And it's got to be the right project for Medford.

137
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,270
So that's, I think, really huge.

138
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:55,213
And my experience having done that in the Somerville High School project, and my experience doing that right now in the Winter Hill High School project,

139
00:11:56,073 --> 00:12:00,856
in Somerville is going to be really important for the next couple of years.

140
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:06,899
Yeah, I mean, that's really nice to hear that you've had this like exact experience in a different city.

141
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,399
And I imagine part of that

142
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:15,412
experience was helping to convince residents of Somerville that this was an important project to invest their money in.

143
00:12:15,773 --> 00:12:24,356
We've talked about this in past episodes about just explaining what a debt exclusion is, but that would be a temporary increase to taxes in order to pay for a big project.

144
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:25,637
Exactly.

145
00:12:25,937 --> 00:12:31,780
Different from an override, which would be like a permanent increase in taxes.

146
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,240
That's right.

147
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:33,091
Yeah.

148
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:33,732
Wow.

149
00:12:34,072 --> 00:12:43,601
So aside from the high school, which I think is a huge project, and I think one that lots of people are thinking about as they vote, what are your other sort of thoughts for the future of Medford Public Schools?

150
00:12:45,622 --> 00:12:45,823
Sure.

151
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:51,107
So something that really keeps me up at night is preservation of our progress.

152
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:58,474
Everywhere you go right now, you listen to NPR, you listen to the radio, you listen to a podcast.

153
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:01,005
These are uncertain times.

154
00:13:01,065 --> 00:13:03,447
We don't know what's going to happen next.

155
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:06,970
That's not OK for education.

156
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,391
That's not OK for our kids.

157
00:13:09,852 --> 00:13:17,518
I'm worried about federal or state cuts in aid.

158
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:29,088
I'm worried about potential slow pace of development in Medford if we have some economic headwinds not in our control.

159
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,861
Pair that with consistently increasing expectations of our schools.

160
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,042
We need to do better every day.

161
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:43,425
That's a recipe for risk.

162
00:13:44,505 --> 00:13:47,206
Part of what I do is trying to make sure that we mitigate those risks.

163
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:56,131
I want to work with the public schools administration, the superintendent, the city council, and the mayor to get on the same page about how we're going to approach these risks together.

164
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:59,973
I don't think that it's helpful for Medford residents

165
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:13,036
If the school committee is holding the mayor or the city council is holding the mayor or someone is holding someone hostage, we need to work together because residents rely on what we do.

166
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:28,566
I also want to work with city staff to make a sustainable multi-year plan to preserve services, including some kind of planning of what if we lose

167
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:37,051
Grant A, what if we lose school lunch funding?

168
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:46,263
What if the state drops our Chapter 70 resources for next year because the feds did something to the state?

169
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,065
So those are the things that keep me up at night.

170
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:59,878
We are also in a really, really important opportunity for this upcoming school committee, you know, who are going to be able to hire a superintendent that aligns with our values.

171
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:11,990
We all know the superintendent is just so, so critical to the success of the district and we got to hire the right person and then we got to work with them to start thinking strategically about.

172
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:14,308
What do we want Medford schools to look like?

173
00:15:14,328 --> 00:15:15,849
And what are the steps we got to take to get there?

174
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,071
Um, I want to be thinking ahead.

175
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:32,363
I want to be looking around corners and I want to make sure that at the end of the day, it's in service of maintaining the core function of what, what a city does, which is, um, funding school for our kids.

176
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,280
Thank you.

177
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:45,084
Yeah, I think this question came up on, or something similar, a similar topic came up about like the federal landscape and how it's impacting us locally and what we think about the role of the school committee in that.

178
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:51,506
And I think you're making some great points that are related to finance and how that impacts, you know, the health of the school system.

179
00:15:52,026 --> 00:15:55,327
I also wonder about like ideological topics.

180
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:58,428
So like how, you know, and, you know, I've heard this phrase like,

181
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:04,171
being grateful to be in Massachusetts, but I don't think that's something that we can continue to take for granted.

182
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:21,541
We had our preliminary election for city council last week, and there was a surprising outcome in terms of how people were voting for more conservative candidates, candidates that have expressed pretty problematic views about lots of things, in my opinion.

183
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:22,342
And I think

184
00:16:24,227 --> 00:16:37,194
that there's only like a small role maybe in how the school committee kind of impacts those sorts of things, but I kind of wonder how you think about that, what your hopes are in terms of preserving some of these things.

185
00:16:38,675 --> 00:16:39,435
Sure.

186
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:42,777
You know, I consider myself a very, very strong progressive.

187
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:44,958
I'm really psyched and fired up.

188
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:50,493
to be running with some great new friends with Our Revolution Medford.

189
00:16:52,375 --> 00:17:03,064
I think we have a really important job to do over the next six or seven weeks here, which is talk to residents about the Medford that we want to see.

190
00:17:04,097 --> 00:17:15,400
right, which funds public schools, which fixes streets and sidewalks, which moves us towards more community safety and removes barriers to participation in government.

191
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:27,764
The reason I wanted to run with those folks is because that vision of what Medford can be is really compelling to me.

192
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,505
I think that

193
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:54,543
We have work to do to make sure that the election goes the way we'd like, but I think in school committee, the way I picture it is think about the team that you want facing challenges that Medford schools are being presented with.

194
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:59,607
I wanna make sure that you have

195
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:10,932
folks with finance experience, folks with curriculum experience, folks with really, really close knit ties to the students, right?

196
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:13,893
You're building a team that's gonna respond to these challenges.

197
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:23,057
Think about how, you know, your vote, who you want on your team with your vote, what you wanna build as a group.

198
00:18:23,197 --> 00:18:27,039
And I think, you know, just because

199
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:37,507
The challenge that I'm really focusing on is the high school and the sustainable investments.

200
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:54,741
I'm really fired up to work on a lot of the other issues that we're seeing in the schools, including things like supporting the after-school ecosystem and taking an all-hands approach on figuring out how we build that out with

201
00:18:55,561 --> 00:19:10,974
our nonprofit partners, how we improve language access, how we try and get a single point of contact for families to tap into the system.

202
00:19:11,014 --> 00:19:13,896
All those kind of concrete things are really exciting as well.

203
00:19:14,357 --> 00:19:19,881
So I'm fired up to work with a team that has values, that has a vision for what they want Medford to look like.

204
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:24,165
I'm not sure all the candidates are

205
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,571
maybe brave enough to put that out there, what they want to see it look like.

206
00:19:30,892 --> 00:19:39,875
And that's why I want to run with these progressive folks who have put a lot of work into making Medford, to improving Medford and making it the place that we all want it to be.

207
00:19:42,836 --> 00:19:48,658
Any other priorities or parts of your platform that we haven't talked about that you want to make sure to mention?

208
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:58,455
You know, when I talk about kind of what team do you want to build for the school committee, you want to kind of piece together skills.

209
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:06,878
I think something that's important to always know is that we don't know what challenges we're going to face.

210
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:13,460
But what are the core values of the people that you're putting in office who are going to take on the next challenge that we don't know?

211
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,480
We can't even imagine what it might be.

212
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:21,622
So what I want folks to know is that core values for me are having

213
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:26,249
well-resourced classrooms in well-maintained buildings.

214
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,372
I want fairly paid educators and staff.

215
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:37,737
I want afterschool programs with capacity, and I want special education that allows Medford kids to stay here in district.

216
00:20:38,658 --> 00:20:43,501
I think we've made a lot of progress there, and I wanna keep that going.

217
00:20:47,144 --> 00:20:51,187
And I wanna bring my skills, my energy, my perspective as a parent

218
00:20:52,250 --> 00:21:01,234
as a public servant and hopefully in the future as a member of the school committee to help make that happen and help the community that has really embraced us.

219
00:21:01,314 --> 00:21:03,935
And I'm really looking forward to that.

220
00:21:03,995 --> 00:21:04,895
It's been so fun so far.

221
00:21:06,216 --> 00:21:06,476
Thank you.

222
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:07,817
It's a lot of exciting ideas.

223
00:21:09,397 --> 00:21:17,601
Any ways that people can communicate with you if they want to share their thoughts or places that we can find you if you're doing any events or things like that?

224
00:21:18,352 --> 00:21:26,870
Best way to reach me is MikeMastroboni.com, M-I-K-E, and then Mastroboni is M-A-S-T-R-O-B-U-O-N-I.

225
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:35,047
Also on Instagram at Mike4Medford, F-O-R Medford.

226
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:37,629
So those are the best places to reach me.

227
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:40,690
My email is also Mike4Medford at gmail.com.

228
00:21:41,711 --> 00:21:44,012
I've learned so much canvassing.

229
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:49,155
I didn't realize that our community was so full of teachers with so much great experience and so many great ideas.

230
00:21:49,735 --> 00:21:51,857
They've all been willing to chat with me about stuff.

231
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:57,240
So if you've got questions or you want to talk about something, just shoot me an email and hope I can earn your vote on November 4th.

232
00:21:59,316 --> 00:21:59,917
Well, thanks, Mike.

233
00:21:59,977 --> 00:22:01,099
Anything else before we wrap up?

234
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,300
Thanks so much, Janet.

235
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,062
I really appreciate you.

236
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:06,587
And thanks to the volunteers, everybody who's out there, everybody who's voting.

237
00:22:07,248 --> 00:22:09,471
You know, Medford politics is so much fun.

238
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:11,074
Thanks, Mike.

239
00:22:18,883 --> 00:22:20,825
