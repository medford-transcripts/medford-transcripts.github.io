Seven present, zero absent.

Do we have any student representatives on our meeting?

00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:28,658
Yes, they'll be here at 6.30.

21
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:28,978
6.30, okay.

22
00:02:30,078 --> 00:02:31,779
And if we may rise to salute the flag.

23
00:02:33,956 --> 00:02:44,618
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

24
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:49,660

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,320
Executive session, 6 p.m.

26
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:59,942

27
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:09,258

28
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:09,838
Is there a motion?

29
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:11,578
Motion to move into executive session.

30
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:15,600

Member McLaughlin, yes.

Member Rousseau.

00:03:22,942 --> 00:03:23,162

Member Van de Kloet.

42
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:25,523
No longer current.

43
00:03:26,484 --> 00:03:28,507
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

44
00:03:28,648 --> 00:03:31,373
We are gonna go to room 207 for executive session.

45
00:41:49,326 --> 00:41:50,786
Good evening, thank you for your patience.

46
00:41:51,087 --> 00:41:53,228
We were in executive session until 644.

47
00:41:53,988 --> 00:41:56,469
We have our student representative, Gabrielle Puccio.

48
00:41:56,509 --> 00:41:57,470
Thank you for joining us.

49
00:41:59,311 --> 00:42:01,412
Next up we have- Point of order.

50
00:42:01,432 --> 00:42:03,753
Point of order.

51
00:42:04,906 --> 00:42:06,067
Point of order, member Russo.

52
00:42:06,247 --> 00:42:07,809
Is there a mask mandate in city hall?

53
00:42:10,131 --> 00:42:11,993
We ask that everybody do wear masks.

54
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:14,135
I think every, I thought everybody had one on.

55
00:42:20,281 --> 00:42:22,583
I think I have some in my office if anybody needs a mask.

56
00:42:23,864 --> 00:42:26,447
Can we have everybody use a mask as required?

57
00:42:27,428 --> 00:42:29,650
The mandate wasn't a request, it was a mandate, correct?

58
00:42:33,131 --> 00:42:33,631
I think we have two.

59
00:42:34,312 --> 00:42:35,894
Would you mind putting, do you have a mask?

60
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,442
If everybody could put on a mask, that'd be great.

61
00:42:44,502 --> 00:42:46,884
Just where there are a lot of people, we have the new variants.

62
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,753
I'll motion to adjourn this meeting if I do not have masks on everybody in the room.

63
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:03,820
I'm not sure what the point of a mandate is, if it is not actually gonna be followed in the very chamber where we're actually governing.

64
00:43:09,023 --> 00:43:11,705
We're just asking everybody in the audience, if you could put a mask, thank you.

65
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:15,747
Exemption.

66
00:43:17,669 --> 00:43:19,370
I can't mandate medical exemption.

67
00:43:20,546 --> 00:43:26,873
We have number four, consent agenda, approval of bills, payrolls, regular school committee meeting minutes, 11-15-2021.

68
00:43:27,513 --> 00:43:30,336
Is there a motion on the floor?

69
00:43:30,356 --> 00:43:31,678
Motion to approve.

70
00:43:31,898 --> 00:43:32,299
Second.

71
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:36,163
Motion to approve by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

72
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:37,064
All those in favor?

73
00:43:37,084 --> 00:43:37,925
Aye.

74
00:43:38,205 --> 00:43:39,026
All those opposed?

75
00:43:54,940 --> 00:44:07,067
We just wanna make a statement and let everybody know, I know there's a number of people that wanna speak tonight, so just make a statement to let you understand when that will be appropriate, which is very soon after the superintendent's update.

76
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:12,431
So we know we have a number of guests with us this evening, potentially both students and staff, which is true.

77
00:44:13,231 --> 00:44:24,158
As the superintendent commented in multiple communications last week at Medford High School in particular, we have seen an important dialogue that has been occurring in recent days regarding student discipline,

78
00:44:24,668 --> 00:44:28,011
school culture, and the overall climate of our school communities.

79
00:44:28,731 --> 00:44:42,261
For that reason, we have an agenda item for tonight's meeting that aims to address some of these concerns and to continue a conversation we've been having for some time around how we best ensure a climate that is conducive to student growth and learning.

80
00:44:43,242 --> 00:44:52,849
When we come to that agenda item in a few minutes, I'm gonna ask for a motion to suspend the rules so we can open up the floor to our guests and allow community participation on this subject matter in particular.

81
00:44:53,763 --> 00:45:05,333
We have rules in place to limit the amount of time for each speaker and for purposes of being respectful, I'm going to ask that time that the speakers adhere to our three minute limitation on comments.

82
00:45:06,934 --> 00:45:19,104
More importantly, however, because of the sensitivity of the topic, I wanna make clear that the reference of specific students or specific incidents of misconduct are not appropriate for this forum.

83
00:45:19,892 --> 00:45:24,633
The school committee is a policy making body and we do not address matters concerning specific children.

84
00:45:25,673 --> 00:45:30,314
It would be unfair to any child to be specifically named in a meeting of a public body like this one.

85
00:45:31,015 --> 00:45:35,816
So again, we are eager to hear from everyone tonight and we wanna give you the floor.

86
00:45:36,716 --> 00:45:42,677
I know there are a lot of meetings and conversations taking place among administrators, counselors and students in recent days.

87
00:45:43,257 --> 00:45:46,458
And I think it is really important that those conversations continue.

88
00:45:47,551 --> 00:46:05,497
But as the Memphis School Committee is a public body, we have a heightened responsibility to both make sure we are engaged in a substantive policy-driven conversation about how do we address these very concerns that our students, staff, parents, and caregivers are bringing to our attention, while also respecting the rights of everyone involved.

89
00:46:06,518 --> 00:46:12,900
So short version, please no names, and let's try to stay away from specifically describing specific incidences

90
00:46:13,612 --> 00:46:21,676
So we can instead focus on the bigger picture issues that we need to address to both keep our kids safe and instill confidence in them to stay safe.

91
00:46:22,417 --> 00:46:26,259
And I know the superintendent will be commenting on this in her remarks as well in just a few minutes.

92
00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:27,760
So thank you for your patience.

93
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:36,344
On number five, we have report of subcommittees, special education, subcommittee meeting minutes, 11-18-2021.

94
00:46:36,564 --> 00:46:37,265
Member McLaughlin.

95
00:46:38,285 --> 00:46:38,706
Thank you.

96
00:46:39,186 --> 00:46:42,728
The special education subcommittee meeting meets every other month.

97
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:52,221
We met to create, to advise with the community, work with the community to advise on a problem of practice for our subcommittee to work on to this year.

98
00:46:52,421 --> 00:47:10,405
And it was a consensus that we recommend to the school committee that we would like to continue to work on establishing friendships for students with and without disabilities, looking into the best buddies programming possibility, disability awareness programming and CCSR projects.

99
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,259
Is there a motion to approve the minutes?

100
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,759
Motion to approve.

101
00:47:15,979 --> 00:47:17,640
My member Russo, seconded by... Second.

102
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,501
Member McLaughlin, roll.

103
00:47:20,121 --> 00:47:20,721
All those in favor?

104
00:47:21,201 --> 00:47:21,321
Aye.

105
00:47:21,461 --> 00:47:22,102
All those opposed?

106
00:47:22,922 --> 00:47:24,202
Meeting minutes are passed.

107
00:47:24,382 --> 00:47:24,643
Mayor?

108
00:47:25,403 --> 00:47:25,963
Member Russo?

109
00:47:26,623 --> 00:47:37,868
I don't see on the agenda the Boy Scout part of the... I know there's some Boy Scout thing going on tonight, and I would like to not have them wait until hours from now.

110
00:47:37,968 --> 00:47:41,169
Is there any way we can... I don't know where it is on the agenda, so it's hard to take it out of order.

111
00:47:43,837 --> 00:47:48,078
Are you here to observe the meeting or did you, are you here, they're here to observe.

112
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,238
Thank you.

113
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:51,658
Thank you.

114
00:47:52,179 --> 00:47:52,859
Thank you for being here.

115
00:47:52,899 --> 00:47:53,219
Welcome.

116
00:47:53,959 --> 00:47:58,640
Um, next up we have report of superintendent superintendents updates and comments.

117
00:47:58,860 --> 00:47:59,980
Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent.

118
00:48:10,182 --> 00:48:10,682
Good evening.

119
00:48:13,479 --> 00:48:18,403
Before I begin with my comments, I must address incidents that have occurred at Medford High School.

120
00:48:19,905 --> 00:48:32,095
As a school district, we have discussed repeatedly the pronounced social and emotional needs of our students coming off of such a long period of instructional disruption caused by the pandemic.

121
00:48:33,656 --> 00:48:39,001
We are very aware that students cannot learn if they do not feel safe and supported.

122
00:48:40,848 --> 00:48:49,634
As educators, it is our moral and professional obligation to cultivate an environment in which every student feels secure and ready to learn.

123
00:48:49,654 --> 00:49:01,022
The most fundamental element of this culture that we are trying to build is a recognition that there is simply no place for violence in our schools.

124
00:49:03,063 --> 00:49:07,166
Last week's fights that occurred at Medford High School resulted in very understandable

125
00:49:09,525 --> 00:49:13,848
and mostly constructive outcry from students who want to see change.

126
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:29,460
We are grateful to the many students who accepted an invitation to meet with our administrators and counselors to begin discussing what steps we can take as a community to foster an environment grounded in support and respect.

127
00:49:31,322 --> 00:49:32,823
This will not happen overnight.

128
00:49:34,161 --> 00:49:42,968
The work has begun and the process will continue until every student and staff member feel safe and comfortable at Medford High School.

129
00:49:43,889 --> 00:49:54,257
We are dedicated to this goal and we urge all in the Mustang community to work with us to help restore the normalcy we expect in all of our schools.

130
00:49:55,798 --> 00:49:56,819
And as we continue

131
00:49:58,206 --> 00:50:03,870
to tackle this, I ask our students to partner with us.

132
00:50:05,011 --> 00:50:05,952
If you hear something,

133
00:50:07,423 --> 00:50:21,753
If you see something, you need to say something to an administrator so that we can be a partner with you to address any challenges that might happen or a plan to happen later in the day.

134
00:50:21,773 --> 00:50:30,439
I also put out a call to parents to partner with us because if you see something at home or you hear something,

135
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:43,229
We ask that you partner with us, call the school, speak with the principal or the counselors and let us know how we can also support you so that together we can build a stronger community.

136
00:50:47,813 --> 00:50:51,516
So those are my remarks on what has happened with last week.

137
00:50:52,016 --> 00:50:56,139
I do wanna continue to give you key updates regarding the district.

138
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:01,103
The first update is about our public health update.

139
00:51:04,571 --> 00:51:19,238
So turning our attention as we do every meeting to public health and COVID-19 related matters, this past week, coming out of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, we saw a significant uptick in COVID-19 positivity.

140
00:51:20,532 --> 00:51:33,503
While our testing program had been returning a positivity rate under 1%, last week, in over 4,000 COVID tests, we returned a positivity rate of just under 4%.

141
00:51:36,766 --> 00:51:43,432
While this was not necessarily surprising, it is a reminder of the need for continued vigilance.

142
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:51,461
especially during this holiday season when so many are gathering with loved ones for social occasions.

143
00:51:53,222 --> 00:52:09,297
As I noted in my message to the community this past Friday, we have seen very strong participation in the vaccination clinics that the Board of Health and the Health Services Department facilitated.

144
00:52:10,796 --> 00:52:17,057
We have an active discussions now with the Board of Health in the hope of organizing additional opportunities for our students.

145
00:52:18,325 --> 00:52:25,727
particularly those between the ages of five and 11, who just became eligible to become vaccinated.

146
00:52:26,548 --> 00:52:32,209
On Saturday, December 11th, at the Andrews Middle School, from 9 a.m.

147
00:52:32,269 --> 00:52:40,152
to 1 p.m., we will hold the second dose clinic to complete the series for students that attended the November 20th clinic.

148
00:52:42,082 --> 00:52:51,211
Being vaccinated is the best way to fulfill the obligation we owe to one another to minimize COVID in our communities and keep our students in school.

149
00:52:53,634 --> 00:53:04,364
As many Medford public school staff members are aware, our employee daycare program, Kids Corner, has seen a COVID outbreak in recent days.

150
00:53:05,902 --> 00:53:12,829
Three of the five Kids Corner classrooms have been forced to quarantine due to COVID spread.

151
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:23,119
Daycare programs in our region and around the country have faced similar and greater challenges since the beginning of the pandemic.

152
00:53:24,397 --> 00:53:29,361
with the age eligibility restrictions for the vaccine being what they are.

153
00:53:30,702 --> 00:53:36,027
The need for heightened vigilance is substantial in programs like Kids' Corner.

154
00:53:36,927 --> 00:53:46,916
We know that this has caused significant stress to our employees who rely on this service, as well as to parents of students whose teachers are affected.

155
00:53:48,405 --> 00:53:59,092
vigilance will be critical to continued operations of kids corner, as it will for all components of our organization, as we continue to emerge from the pandemic.

156
00:54:03,075 --> 00:54:08,420
I do wanna say that I hope everyone had a safe and enjoyable Thanksgiving holiday.

157
00:54:09,441 --> 00:54:29,939
I wanted to take this moment to extend a special thank you to Bill and Sue Honeycutt of John Brewer's Tavern for hosting Medford and Malden football teams, coaches, cheerleaders, mayors, and both central administrations for the annual Thanksgiving luncheon.

158
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:35,729
I also want to extend a huge thanks to Dr. Cushing, Principal DeLava.

159
00:54:37,293 --> 00:54:53,059
Athletic Director Maloney, Building and Grounds Director McLaughlin, Band Director Mizrelo, the Mustang Band, our cheerleaders, for presenting, I believe, the first ever outdoor pep rally for Thanksgiving.

160
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:58,621
By hosting it outside, it allowed us all to cheer on our football team safely.

161
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:05,944
For those who enjoyed the close game on Turkey Day, the Mustangs truly appreciated your support.

162
00:55:06,844 --> 00:55:15,606
Although we did not prevail, it was a hard-fought game with the final score, Malden 12 and Medford 10.

163
00:55:17,787 --> 00:55:26,369
Speaking of athletics, winter sports tryouts began on November 29th for both Medford High School and our middle schools.

164
00:55:27,189 --> 00:55:29,470
Winter season begins late this week.

165
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:45,200
I also want to share that the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, Mayor Brianna and I were honored to join with Principal Garvino and Assistant Principal Andrews at the McGlynn Elementary School's Thanksgiving food drive.

166
00:55:46,001 --> 00:55:48,082
It was organized by teachers, Ms.

167
00:55:48,102 --> 00:55:49,383
Daugherty, Ms.

168
00:55:49,423 --> 00:55:50,824
Fiorentino, and Ms.

169
00:55:50,844 --> 00:55:51,405
Materano.

170
00:55:53,086 --> 00:55:58,811
They were able to provide food baskets to families in need through the Medford Family Network.

171
00:56:00,589 --> 00:56:11,176
All the students participated, and I'm proud to say that they did not get donations from supermarkets, so it was a school-sponsored event, and they were really able to help our community in need.

172
00:56:13,438 --> 00:56:26,687
I also want to extend sincere congratulations to our Medford Mustang Marching Band for placing third in Division III at the New England Scholastic Band Association's Championship Finals.

173
00:56:27,642 --> 00:56:33,371
Their show, The Force, earned them a score of 91.4 out of 100 from the judges at the competition in Reading.

174
00:56:37,808 --> 00:56:39,228
on October 31st.

175
00:56:40,069 --> 00:56:52,212
Member McStone's daughter, Teagan, serves as a drum major and led the band through its competition season, which took them to Melrose, North Andover, Wakefield, Billerica, and Dartmouth.

176
00:56:53,392 --> 00:57:04,895
At two of the competitions, the Color Guard, led by seniors Alyssa Parziale, Kaylee McCray, and Laura Lewis, along with freshman Maria Zasra,

177
00:57:06,215 --> 00:57:08,276
They took first place in Division III.

178
00:57:09,476 --> 00:57:17,339
The band includes students from Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School, and the McGlynn and Andrews Middle Schools.

179
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:24,481
Additionally, I want to just share some wonderful news and I want to thank the Medford community.

180
00:57:26,991 --> 00:57:35,801
This past weekend, the Mustang Band Parents Association sold 160 trees and 120 wreaths.

181
00:57:36,501 --> 00:57:41,647
I want to thank the Medford community for your generous support of our wonderful band.

182
00:57:43,028 --> 00:57:45,889
As a result of essentially being sold out.

183
00:57:46,949 --> 00:57:52,910
There are no more leaves left, no more trees left, they actually came down to the final five trees.

184
00:57:53,731 --> 00:57:57,071
And so, those five trees will be sold by appointment only.

185
00:57:57,091 --> 00:58:07,254
It's a great annual fundraiser, and as a result of the great success, they will not be selling trees this weekend but thank you again on behalf of our wonderful band.

186
00:58:07,834 --> 00:58:15,526
and the parents who worked in the band students who volunteered their time this weekend and last weekend as well.

187
00:58:16,934 --> 00:58:24,699
On Saturday as well, the Medford Family Network's annual toy and book swap was held, and it was an amazing success.

188
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:33,806
The Medford Family Network is indebted to so many organizations and individuals who have stepped up to benefit our families.

189
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:43,032
They are reaching out one more time to match the 30 remaining families who need to be matched with a donor.

190
00:58:44,193 --> 00:58:46,721
We have families of a variety of sizes.

191
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:52,016
Each family has submitted a list of three wishes per child.

192
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,342
We're calling you a wish filler.

193
00:58:56,762 --> 00:59:12,431
If you would like to be a wish filler for those remaining 30 families, please contact Marie Cassidy at 781-393-2106 or mcassidyatmedford.k12.ma.us.

194
00:59:13,411 --> 00:59:20,315
And if anyone would like to help and just be an additional support during this time, reach out to Marie Cassidy.

195
00:59:20,475 --> 00:59:21,976
They are looking for helpers as well.

196
00:59:23,837 --> 00:59:28,640
I want to say that last week, Memphit High School hosted their parent-teacher conferences in the gym.

197
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:38,305
It was wonderful that parents and caregivers were able to meet with their students' teachers in person this year, and both days were very successful.

198
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:54,042
So we do have a few upcoming events, as I bring my remarks to a close this Wednesday, December 8 from six to 8pm Medford CPAC will have a presentation on basic rights, understanding the IP.

199
00:59:55,023 --> 00:59:57,966
Please note that pre registration is required.

200
00:59:58,767 --> 01:00:02,130
Also on Wednesday, December 8 at 7pm.

201
01:00:02,871 --> 01:00:09,878
The winter concert featuring the middle school band high school band and marching band will be held in a Karen theater.

202
01:00:10,939 --> 01:00:22,332
On Thursday, December 9th at 7pm, the winter concert featuring the Middle School Orchestra and High School Orchestra will be held in the Caron Theater.

203
01:00:22,892 --> 01:00:27,478
Both concerts are open to the public for a $5 admission fee.

204
01:00:28,198 --> 01:00:32,163
Please plan to wear a face covering when you are inside the building.

205
01:00:33,487 --> 01:00:46,191
On Saturday, December 11, this coming Saturday from nine to one, again as a second dose vaccination clinic at the Andrews Middle School for our students that are five to 11 years old.

206
01:00:49,861 --> 01:00:52,523
The Jewish holiday of Hanukkah ends this evening.

207
01:00:52,543 --> 01:00:58,646
It is my hope that our Jewish families and neighbors had an enjoyable and safe holiday.

208
01:00:58,666 --> 01:01:04,930
I would like to end my comments with this quote from Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sachs.

209
01:01:06,791 --> 01:01:10,614
For they, my faith is not yours and your faith is not mine.

210
01:01:11,374 --> 01:01:18,518
If we are each free to light our own flame together, we can banish some of the darkness of the world.

211
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:19,459
Thank you.

212
01:01:21,633 --> 01:01:22,773
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

213
01:01:24,154 --> 01:01:24,854
Member Rousseau.

214
01:01:25,334 --> 01:01:25,714
Thank you.

215
01:01:26,395 --> 01:01:27,975
I just had a quick question about our dashboard.

216
01:01:28,035 --> 01:01:36,518
Does the dashboard include Kids' Corner staff and children that are in the Kids' Corner for positive cases?

217
01:01:37,018 --> 01:01:37,978
Our school dashboard.

218
01:01:38,178 --> 01:01:39,339
On the school dashboard?

219
01:01:39,919 --> 01:01:40,099
Yes.

220
01:01:40,851 --> 01:01:43,393
But I don't, if you don't know, I mean, we can just, I'm not sure.

221
01:01:43,413 --> 01:01:48,097
I believe for staff, they would definitely be included.

222
01:01:48,117 --> 01:01:51,000
And I, yes, I'm getting a yes.

223
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,401
I just put my cheaters on.

224
01:01:52,641 --> 01:01:52,861
Okay.

225
01:01:53,101 --> 01:01:53,862
Thank you very much.

226
01:01:53,902 --> 01:01:54,082
Yes.

227
01:01:54,162 --> 01:01:54,463
Thank you.

228
01:01:58,959 --> 01:02:12,953
We have number two briefing on student disciplinary policies and efforts related to school climate and culture, Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, Assistant Superintendent Dr. Peter Cushing, and Assistant Superintendent Suzanne Galluzzi, and Ms.

229
01:02:13,013 --> 01:02:13,654
Stacey Shulman.

230
01:02:33,186 --> 01:02:33,726
Good evening.

231
01:02:36,128 --> 01:02:43,534
This evening, we will be presenting Culture, Climate, and Disciplinary Practices.

232
01:02:44,955 --> 01:02:55,923
Again, this evening, Suzanne Galussi, our Assistant Superintendent of Elementary Schools, Dr. Peter Cushing, our Assistant Superintendent of Secondary Schools, and Ms.

233
01:02:55,943 --> 01:03:01,868
Stacey Schulman, our Director of School Counseling and Behavioral Health, will be presenting.

234
01:03:04,397 --> 01:03:04,857
Thank you.

235
01:03:06,518 --> 01:03:17,023
The first statement that I would like to just start off by saying the Medford Public Schools condemns any and all types of violence.

236
01:03:18,404 --> 01:03:33,691
That includes physical violence, domestic violence, hate crimes, psychological violence, neglect, verbal abuse, cultural violence, and sexual violence.

237
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:46,923
Mr. McLaughlin, are you able to turn on the microphone at the podium?

238
01:03:49,224 --> 01:03:49,585
Thank you.

239
01:03:50,765 --> 01:03:51,586
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

240
01:03:53,237 --> 01:04:01,080
Dr. Edward Vincent, members of the school committee, and thank you to all the parents, students, and families that have joined us here tonight as we discuss this important topic.

241
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:16,225
As we open up this evening, I wanted to provide a brief update for families and the community on the practices of exclusion when those are rarely enacted by the Medford Public Schools.

242
01:04:16,525 --> 01:04:19,466
There's been a renewed focus to make sure

243
01:04:20,006 --> 01:04:29,392
that any type of exclusion is extraordinarily narrowly tailored and employed in only the rarest and most necessary of circumstances.

244
01:04:31,073 --> 01:04:48,945
Our priority as a learning and growing organization that supports young people's movement through life is to employ restorative practices that will maximize learning opportunities for those students who have engaged in misconduct and the continuity of everyone's

245
01:04:49,965 --> 01:04:51,587
learning in school.

246
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:58,874
Finally, any changes in policy do not and does not prohibit out-of-school suspensions.

247
01:04:59,434 --> 01:05:08,863
It simply affirms the fact that Medford Public Schools will not exclude students from school and processes outlined stated by the

248
01:05:10,524 --> 01:05:15,827
by the process, so to make sure that any exclusions are narrowly tailored.

249
01:05:16,408 --> 01:05:20,891
Those narrowly tailored exclusions fall into five broad categories.

250
01:05:21,491 --> 01:05:30,117
First, any type of violent behavior, possession of weaponry, those types of things exhibited through words and the like.

251
01:05:32,165 --> 01:05:56,699
When a student is exhibited through language or actions, animus or hostility grounded in racist or discriminatory beliefs that contribute to a negative environment that may plague our school and marginalize students under race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification, or any other immutable characteristic of who they are as a person.

252
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:08,095
when a student is engaged in bullying or once a bullying investigation is complete and procedure have been put in place, retaliation, all right?

253
01:06:08,195 --> 01:06:15,039
That continued harm that can happen to a student through that continued bullying once the school's process has been in place.

254
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:25,264
A student who is found in possession of drugs as classified by mass general law or the distribution of such drugs to other students.

255
01:06:26,384 --> 01:06:40,368
And finally, a pronounced and repeated disregard for academic integrity focused on tampering, cheating, plagiarism, and any other misrepresentation to a student's work product.

256
01:06:41,048 --> 01:06:43,289
So those are those narrowly tailored things.

257
01:06:43,329 --> 01:06:50,591
Some final notes on the disciplinary process and the rare narrowly tailored student exclusion.

258
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:58,700
So non-exclusionary disciplinary measures are to be used whenever possible, right?

259
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:02,483
No distinction, there is no distinction between in-school and out-of-school suspension.

260
01:07:03,504 --> 01:07:09,229
Exclusionary practices are narrowly tailored in those five situations that were previously mentioned.

261
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:14,214
Principals are the decision makers when it comes to an exclusion.

262
01:07:16,061 --> 01:07:27,246
In-school suspension programs will be developed so that we can provide restorative supports and maximize the extent of providing academic support to students as well.

263
01:07:27,927 --> 01:07:37,851
Principals should make close note of the egregiousness and egregiousness and intent elements of excludable offenses and will seek guidance from myself, Ms.

264
01:07:37,871 --> 01:07:42,654
Galussi, Mr. Murphy or the superintendent as the situation may require.

265
01:07:44,341 --> 01:07:49,046
making sure that our reporting requirements are strictly adhered to for our staff.

266
01:07:49,686 --> 01:08:01,159
And finally, focusing on short-term suspensions and the difference between long-term suspensions under categories perceived by law.

267
01:08:03,157 --> 01:08:10,403
So currently we wanted to identify some contributing factors that we have noticed in our work.

268
01:08:11,264 --> 01:08:15,227
First, the students returning to in-person regimented instruction.

269
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:20,191
We made preparations and deployed some things that we're gonna discuss.

270
01:08:21,332 --> 01:08:32,481
However, after almost 18 months of remote learning for a third of our students and significant disruption from the pandemic,

271
01:08:33,501 --> 01:08:37,825
I would say that we have more work to do to make sure that we are fully supporting students.

272
01:08:38,766 --> 01:08:45,131
Despite putting in a significant amount of resources and support, we still have a significant amount of work to do.

273
01:08:47,677 --> 01:08:56,999
coverage concerns, teachers and other staff who are legitimately ill or facing issues with COVID-19 are out of the buildings.

274
01:08:58,019 --> 01:09:01,659
As an example, today at our high school, there were 18 absences alone.

275
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,040
We had one substitute who could cover.

276
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:15,382
The rest of those coverages and classes were covered by teachers that Principal DeLaver and his team and Mr. Fallon and others pieced together through teacher preps.

277
01:09:16,789 --> 01:09:18,050
so that they can have coverage.

278
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:25,573
Our directors, some of whom are in the audience here today also provide coverage.

279
01:09:25,593 --> 01:09:29,415
And we've been trying to provide stop gaps by hiring people.

280
01:09:29,595 --> 01:09:36,279
And we've participated in two hiring fairs and have had limited response to the call for substitutes.

281
01:09:37,779 --> 01:09:40,421
The social emotional needs are outstripping resources.

282
01:09:41,141 --> 01:09:42,602
There's no way to undersell this.

283
01:09:43,837 --> 01:09:50,602
The damage caused by the pandemic and other related issues is far outstripping what we have available.

284
01:09:51,202 --> 01:10:01,349
We are unable to recruit counselors for open positions and contract services that we have contracted with outside partners for.

285
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:08,394
This is not from a lack of will or desire or active efforts to try to bring counselors in.

286
01:10:09,435 --> 01:10:12,938
It is simply the inability to find the people to fill the positions.

287
01:10:13,962 --> 01:10:19,863
Outside providers caseloads are full and they have long wait lists that may be six or nine months long.

288
01:10:21,864 --> 01:10:25,025
And that's specifically focused around the needs of our adolescents.

289
01:10:26,325 --> 01:10:29,886
Our school counseling caseloads are near recommended capacity.

290
01:10:30,866 --> 01:10:33,247
School counseling caseloads are never technically full.

291
01:10:33,847 --> 01:10:42,229
However, our in-school staff are facing a significant brunt of the social emotional needs of our students.

292
01:10:45,922 --> 01:10:48,563
And so discipline is a result of a student action.

293
01:10:49,283 --> 01:11:07,209
All right, social emotional learning is one of the preventative measure that we are trying to employ to alleviate students' social emotional needs, to support them, and most recently, to make sure that they are heard and moving forward.

294
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:14,331
At this time, I'll turn over parts of the presentation to Stacey Shulman at this time.

295
01:11:17,622 --> 01:11:18,142
Good evening.

296
01:11:19,003 --> 01:11:27,950
One of the things we heard from students and parents, and sometimes staff is who are the counseling supports in our building and what is the difference so I wanted to clarify that this evening.

297
01:11:29,691 --> 01:11:35,675
School counselors who are often called guidance counselors point of information sorry man I'm having a hard time hearing you.

298
01:11:36,116 --> 01:11:37,557
Sorry, can you hear me now.

299
01:11:37,857 --> 01:11:38,077
Yeah.

300
01:11:39,498 --> 01:11:40,759
I'm gonna lean in.

301
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:54,969
School counselors, often called guidance counselors, help with academics, course selection, college and career planning, and they also provide individual and group counseling in our schools, which we've bolstered significantly related to groups during the day.

302
01:11:55,629 --> 01:12:03,435
Adjustment counselors provide individual and group counseling, mental health screeners, assessments, and help make referrals to those outside resources.

303
01:12:03,895 --> 01:12:07,158
They also provide additional support to our school counselors.

304
01:12:07,958 --> 01:12:14,021
We also have school psychologists who perform our special education evaluation and they provide counseling as well.

305
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:30,569
This is a visual for our student support practices and it provides information related to what are our tier one practices, which include a lot of social emotional learning.

306
01:12:31,718 --> 01:12:35,180
positive behavior interventions, responsive classroom.

307
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:46,307
Tier two, once you go through the referral and student support system, involves group counseling, check-ins, increased contact with home and school.

308
01:12:47,068 --> 01:12:58,415
And then we have your tier three, which is evidence-based counseling strategies, cognitive behavioral therapy, behavioral intervention plans, wraparound services, and interagency support for students.

309
01:13:08,902 --> 01:13:09,362
Good evening.

310
01:13:10,043 --> 01:13:13,185
I'm just going to touch a little bit on the elementary portion.

311
01:13:13,885 --> 01:13:21,030
This slide just, I know I've spoken to you about the responsive classroom implementation and initiative over these past two years.

312
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:32,258
And so these are just the dates that I've presented about responsive classroom to this governing board with the link to those presentations just for your review.

313
01:13:33,258 --> 01:13:36,520
But what I want to do on this next slide is just remind everyone.

314
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:38,502
So at the elementary level and response,

315
01:13:39,323 --> 01:13:48,285
to this proactive approach is the responsive classroom program, which is woven through everything we do at the elementary level.

316
01:13:50,096 --> 01:13:55,418
Responsive classroom is a set of practices that build academic and social-emotional competencies.

317
01:13:56,138 --> 01:13:58,179
It's a belief that children learn best when they feel safe.

318
01:13:59,399 --> 01:14:04,261
Classroom expectations, routines, those are all discussed with students.

319
01:14:04,561 --> 01:14:10,003
They are modeled with students, so students know what it looks like and sounds like.

320
01:14:11,449 --> 01:14:12,850
within their learning environments.

321
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:19,815
The language that's used throughout this, and this is the piece that we're focusing on this year.

322
01:14:20,275 --> 01:14:26,740
Last year when we brought responsive classroom in, at all the buildings, it was that like foundational level.

323
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:36,166
So all the training with staff, all the work we did in the buildings was on the first six weeks, setting it up in the classrooms, and it was on morning meeting.

324
01:14:36,346 --> 01:14:37,227
What does that look like?

325
01:14:37,367 --> 01:14:39,909
And it was all of those foundational pieces.

326
01:14:40,549 --> 01:14:46,311
This year, that is still there, and it is still reviewed, but we're adding in the next layer, which is the language.

327
01:14:46,651 --> 01:14:55,113
Because the language that we use as professionals with one another as colleagues, as well as with students, really can set the tone.

328
01:14:55,714 --> 01:15:03,336
And so the leadership style that we have and the language we use with those around us in that environment is what we're focusing on this year.

329
01:15:04,336 --> 01:15:12,845
And I do want to say that like Stacey Shulman has been my partner in this work from the very beginning, our first presentation to you was together.

330
01:15:12,865 --> 01:15:25,238
And the next piece which is the nexus was also a combination of Stacey and our work last year when we knew returning from the pandemic was going to be difficult for students.

331
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:29,400
And so we added this fifth special into our schedule.

332
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:44,565
So students, so the responsive classroom piece is the woven embedded part and nexus is this explicit teaching of some of those social emotional skills, as well as the executive functioning skills that can limit the social emotional pieces as well.

333
01:15:45,105 --> 01:15:50,367
We created this together as the fifth special so that students once a week have this

334
01:15:52,168 --> 01:16:02,794
Learning in their schedules and part of the curriculum that they're doing in there is our Michigan model zones of regulation pieces where students are working on self regulation and social emotional skills.

335
01:16:04,596 --> 01:16:06,637
Okay, thank you.

336
01:16:11,522 --> 01:16:13,223
specifically at the secondary level.

337
01:16:13,383 --> 01:16:18,767
We've talked about this previously as well with the committee is we're working on social emotional learning in the classroom.

338
01:16:19,168 --> 01:16:34,899
And we focused on the first three weeks of not deploying the full curriculum frameworks so that we could have relationship building work with our students, um, established classroom routines, um, really working on creating physically and emotionally safe spaces.

339
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:51,390
Focusing on cultural awareness and providing ongoing professional development for members of the For members of the school community and educators through faculty meetings and other things along those lines.

340
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:57,434
So at secondary using faculty meeting time to deploy professional admin strategies.

341
01:16:57,887 --> 01:17:00,608
so we can facilitate and enhance classroom culture.

342
01:17:01,608 --> 01:17:06,209
High school advisory periods to present critical topics connected to students.

343
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:24,672
Andrews Middle School last year had a restorative justice pilot looking right now and in conversations with several organizations to expand that pilot to the McGlynn Middle School, Curtis Tufts High School, and Medford High School, the whole campus.

344
01:17:25,832 --> 01:17:50,766
Windblock assemblies at our middle schools have been focused on LGBTQ+, students interacting with social media, advocating for mental health, healthy relationships, rules, routines, rituals, plus etiquette, and the Sandy Hook Promise Start with Hello campaign, and at Medford High School, utilizing community circles as a way to support students.

345
01:17:51,207 --> 01:17:53,648
The windblock are samples from

346
01:17:54,244 --> 01:17:55,585
collected from both middle schools.

347
01:17:57,967 --> 01:17:59,648
So some of our current partnerships.

348
01:18:03,871 --> 01:18:12,397
We're currently partnering with Dr. Randy Schuster, who has presented here previously around student substance abuse, and she works at MGH.

349
01:18:14,457 --> 01:18:22,001
Oh, sorry, Dr. Randy Schuster, who has presented here at school committee previously regarding student substance abuse and mental health.

350
01:18:23,602 --> 01:18:26,044
Respond, Inc., which is a domestic violence agency.

351
01:18:26,304 --> 01:18:36,750
I wanna publicly thank them for their incredible quick response to answer my phone call on Wednesday afternoon and show up to support students who are interested in learning more about domestic violence.

352
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:39,611
About a hundred students attended that presentation at will.

353
01:18:40,692 --> 01:18:56,200
pathways to restorative communities who had been working with us with the Andrews middle school and will continue to work with our schools Sandy hook promise who we are working with through the Attorney General's office, which is the start with hello campaign and we will continue with signs of suicide.

354
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:58,281
as well as see something, say something.

355
01:18:59,082 --> 01:19:09,169
The Safe and Supportive Schools Learning Collaborative, which we were awarded a partnership with this summer, who is working with us to develop more robust mental health screenings in our schools.

356
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:17,736
Riverside Crisis, again, who very quickly answered my call on Wednesday to provide us with two additional counselors this week to help support students and staff.

357
01:19:18,596 --> 01:19:24,541
And of course, Massachusetts Partnerships for Youth, who is always here to provide workshops to our staff and our students.

358
01:19:30,051 --> 01:19:30,712
Member Van de Kloot.

359
01:19:31,292 --> 01:19:37,858
Yes, I just want to bring to the attention just in case somebody wants to let somebody know who's not here.

360
01:19:38,619 --> 01:19:40,000
There's a problem with the audio.

361
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,781
Comcast is having a problem.

362
01:19:42,062 --> 01:19:44,664
Yeah, we're working with that through Medford Community Media.

363
01:19:44,684 --> 01:19:44,804
Right.

364
01:19:44,844 --> 01:19:45,344
John's on it.

365
01:19:45,685 --> 01:19:54,332
And it says that if people want to go, if anybody wants to text friends, they can go to the Medford's YouTube channel to be able to watch the meeting.

366
01:19:54,553 --> 01:19:56,654
As well as Zoom, audio, everything's working.

367
01:19:56,955 --> 01:19:57,195
Thank you.

368
01:19:59,608 --> 01:20:04,692
So I think that this work needs for us to define next steps.

369
01:20:05,473 --> 01:20:15,060
So last week we had extraordinarily informative and robust initial conversations with members of our school community.

370
01:20:16,461 --> 01:20:24,528
At first, a group of nine students met with myself, Mr. Leiber, Mr. Fallon, and Mr. Teixeira.

371
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:32,735
And so that group of nine students provided us with some critical information on culture and climate.

372
01:20:33,736 --> 01:20:40,042
Unbeknownst to us, another group of slightly short of 20 students were patiently waiting for us to join them.

373
01:20:40,523 --> 01:20:42,605
They were in our cafeteria last Wednesday.

374
01:20:43,266 --> 01:20:47,630
We then moved to lecture hall two to meet with them and to hear their concerns.

375
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:56,495
And those two initial conversations were extremely fruitful, provided us with critical information that is going to help us in these next steps.

376
01:20:56,815 --> 01:21:05,920
The following day, we established a number of meetings with about 40 to 50 students throughout Medford High School, bridging grade spans.

377
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:13,524
And those students were able to provide further insight and further conversations that will continue.

378
01:21:14,624 --> 01:21:24,452
We also at Medford have instituted for the first time since I've been here, student advisory councils as required by law that are meeting every other month.

379
01:21:24,852 --> 01:21:25,053
And Ms.

380
01:21:25,433 --> 01:21:28,555
Puccio, our student representative is one member of that.

381
01:21:29,156 --> 01:21:37,463
There are another eight or nine members at our high school and not required by law, but I felt required to really represent the district.

382
01:21:37,883 --> 01:21:41,526
We also have a middle school team as well with five students from

383
01:21:42,066 --> 01:21:46,872
the Andrews and five students from the McGlynn, we are meeting every other week.

384
01:21:47,273 --> 01:21:57,305
All right, so those students have voiced with both their principals and myself and are very excited for that initial.

385
01:21:57,685 --> 01:22:00,229
What I will say is that the student conversations last week

386
01:22:00,689 --> 01:22:05,833
show that we need to expand our conversations and our outreach with students, and we will do that.

387
01:22:07,315 --> 01:22:17,783
So other next steps, establishing an anonymous tip line for students to provide confidential information to school leaders so that we can be responsive in the moment.

388
01:22:18,504 --> 01:22:25,130
Continuing student focus groups with school and district leaders to fully understand student needs for their school's culture and climate.

389
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:26,991
And working partnerships.

390
01:22:27,472 --> 01:22:28,232
This is critical.

391
01:22:28,613 --> 01:22:32,376
These are working partnerships with students because they are their schools.

392
01:22:33,297 --> 01:22:40,703
As they will be the alumni of Medford Public Schools, they are the ones who need to help us to truly establish the culture and climate of our schools.

393
01:22:42,164 --> 01:22:46,226
surveying students for feedback concerning their school and current life experiences.

394
01:22:46,967 --> 01:22:56,272
So all parents in grades six through 12 understand you should have received an email from your principal last week and you will receive a hard copy letter in partnership with the Medford Department of Health.

395
01:22:56,872 --> 01:22:59,995
We will be doing the Communities that Care Youth Survey.

396
01:23:00,835 --> 01:23:14,786
This year, we have added questions around social media, as well as the traditional questions that are there, and have also asked more broad questions concerning students' gender, gender identity as well.

397
01:23:15,627 --> 01:23:23,973
Surveying students will also be done through some additional culture and climate-specific surveys for our students in grades six through 12.

398
01:23:25,174 --> 01:23:39,759
the student advisory councils that I mentioned, and reviewing and reworking how student advisories at the high school specifically work to support and respond to student needs in order to really institute restorative justice.

399
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:49,283
Instituting restorative justice is anywhere from a two to a five year, three to a five year build to make sure that it is well supported for our students.

400
01:23:50,063 --> 01:23:57,607
I do want to let any of the students who were part of those groups last week, I've had a chance to speak to some of them and emailed some of them this evening.

401
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:00,309
We have already started to reach out.

402
01:24:01,029 --> 01:24:06,713
One of the things they requested was peer mediation, all right, for students to be trained as peer mediators.

403
01:24:07,193 --> 01:24:12,416
We have already reached out to organizations and they're starting to have those conversations.

404
01:24:12,876 --> 01:24:23,784
So for the students who are here and the students on Zoom or students beyond my voice, let them know that their voices are already starting to help change the climate and culture of our schools.

405
01:24:24,244 --> 01:24:25,165
Dr. Edward Vinson.

406
01:24:27,527 --> 01:24:29,048
There's one more slide, Dr. Cushing.

407
01:24:30,785 --> 01:24:43,896
So we understand that while work has begun in order to address these situations, we still have significant work to do in order to create the schools we want for our students and the community as a whole.

408
01:24:44,376 --> 01:24:50,701
We will continue to look for additional partners to help us do the work and do it well.

409
01:24:51,202 --> 01:24:51,602
Thank you.

410
01:24:54,044 --> 01:24:55,065
Thank you for the presentation.

411
01:24:56,448 --> 01:25:00,634
Is there a motion on the floor to suspend the rules to allow parents and residents and students?

412
01:25:01,134 --> 01:25:02,376
Motion to suspend the rules.

413
01:25:03,257 --> 01:25:05,500
Moved by Member Van de Kloet, seconded by Member Kretz.

414
01:25:05,841 --> 01:25:06,582
All those in favor?

415
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:06,882
Aye.

416
01:25:07,223 --> 01:25:07,943
All those opposed?

417
01:25:08,664 --> 01:25:09,345
Paper passes.

418
01:25:09,365 --> 01:25:09,405
Ms.

419
01:25:09,866 --> 01:25:11,568
Puccio, would you like to go first?

420
01:25:11,789 --> 01:25:12,710
Our student representative?

421
01:25:28,783 --> 01:25:32,164
Good evening, Madam Mayor, Superintendent, and school committee members.

422
01:25:32,824 --> 01:25:42,287
Before I read my statement, I would like to mention that I'm a junior at Medford High School, and never once have I felt entirely secure in the place where I should be feeling welcomed, safe, and comfortable.

423
01:25:43,587 --> 01:25:50,069
After last week's events, my classmates and I have several mixed emotions, along with passion towards the mortifying issues that have been taking place.

424
01:25:51,249 --> 01:25:58,011
School is a place where we go to learn and expand our knowledge, specifically to benefit our understanding of topics, such as ones being spoken of tonight.

425
01:25:59,619 --> 01:26:09,950
During several school days last week, the student body felt the urgency to walk out of school to confront the reoccurring violence and to make a much needed statement to administrators about what we think as students should be done to resolve the matter.

426
01:26:11,972 --> 01:26:20,181
Members of administration have been focusing more on discussing punishments to students who are exerting their right to protest rather than those who are instigating and participating in violent acts.

427
01:26:21,616 --> 01:26:28,260
Despite confidentiality being an issue and knowing the full truth and an individual's consequences, there are not been a single statement to the students.

428
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:32,642
This left us confused, frustrated, and letting us assume nothing was being done.

429
01:26:33,823 --> 01:26:44,789
Additionally, on behalf of the students, we ask that you reconsider the removal of suspensions as consequences must be enforced in situations like these in order to ensure the safety and confidence of the student body as a whole.

430
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:53,043
As for situations where violence is present between individuals, it should be addressed by law enforcement taking priority over school administration.

431
01:26:53,864 --> 01:26:58,586
Violence is violence in or out of school, and it must be addressed in a legal and appropriate way.

432
01:26:59,567 --> 01:27:06,831
The latest incidence of violence in school is the wake-up call that elected officials needed in order to grasp the idea that there is a much-needed change districtwide.

433
01:27:07,831 --> 01:27:18,162
COVID-19 was never a valid excuse of violence, and although it has affected numerous populations in a negative manner, it does not validate physical harm towards another student, nor make it acceptable in any way.

434
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:28,114
If we do not start giving proper consequences to those who are causing harm to students in school, there will be no change of actions and behavior will be an ongoing cycle and pattern in students.

435
01:27:29,275 --> 01:27:37,599
As a student representative, I speak for myself as well as many others when I say that this entire situation is extremely unnerving and causes emotional and mental distress to many.

436
01:27:38,739 --> 01:27:45,222
We believe that there should be more actions taken to secure the safety and wellbeing of students in the school environment.

437
01:27:45,422 --> 01:27:47,864
After the events that happened in Michigan not too long ago,

438
01:27:48,803 --> 01:27:55,741
We need to be taking every step possible to prevent continuous issues and violence of any sort should not be tolerated and only be taken seriously.

439
01:27:56,872 --> 01:28:04,534
Not only is violence an issue at Medford High School, but there are also issues such as sexual harassment, racism, sexism, bullying, and et cetera.

440
01:28:05,434 --> 01:28:16,798
Each of the victims of issues such as these can confidently say that those who have poorly affected them have not received proper punishments, and issues often seem to be swept under the rug, as I've heard a classmate of mine say.

441
01:28:17,738 --> 01:28:21,759
If there are not stricter guidelines, poor behavior will be a prevalent and reoccurring theme in school.

442
01:28:23,024 --> 01:28:30,028
Most of the staff in Medford High School typically shun the ideas from students, leaving us no say in matters that determine our own experience of high school.

443
01:28:31,029 --> 01:28:36,612
Similarly to the school committee, none of the members are first-hand students who spend six hours a day in the building.

444
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:41,675
It's difficult to watch members making choices on matters that they are not experiencing themselves.

445
01:28:42,816 --> 01:28:45,357
This is one reason why I'm grateful to be here as a representative.

446
01:28:46,177 --> 01:28:52,859
We ask that you step in our shoes and imagine what you would feel like if these events were taking place and you had absolutely no say.

447
01:28:54,119 --> 01:28:58,461
Truthfully, this is how the students in Medford feel currently, and much too often.

448
01:28:59,281 --> 01:29:03,522
This is a matter where I say is crucial to our education, safety, and overall mental health.

449
01:29:04,382 --> 01:29:12,045
Above all, communication needs to be improved, and the lack of information that students, parents, guardians, and even educators receive is completely unsettling.

450
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:17,032
Thank you for hearing me and I hope that you consider all that I've had to say on behalf of the Medford students.

451
01:29:21,113 --> 01:29:21,534
Mayor.

452
01:29:25,235 --> 01:29:28,056
Mayor, can I ask the point of information action there?

453
01:29:28,096 --> 01:29:30,837
Can we just, is it okay, Mayor?

454
01:29:30,937 --> 01:29:31,598
Member McLaughlin?

455
01:29:31,658 --> 01:29:31,938
Thank you.

456
01:29:32,538 --> 01:29:34,139
I just wanted to ask if Ms.

457
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:39,821
Puccio, would you mind submitting that to us in writing just so we can see it as well?

458
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:41,382
I had a hard time hearing some of it.

459
01:29:41,762 --> 01:29:42,062
Thank you.

460
01:29:43,032 --> 01:29:43,552
Thank you, Ms.

461
01:29:43,592 --> 01:29:43,913
Fuccio.

462
01:29:45,233 --> 01:29:45,754
Thank you, Ms.

463
01:29:45,794 --> 01:29:46,194
Fuccio.

464
01:29:51,257 --> 01:29:51,858
Member Russo?

465
01:29:52,498 --> 01:29:57,521
I've just got a question about the format here, because I'm assuming a bunch of us have questions.

466
01:29:59,262 --> 01:30:09,989
Is the format going to be that we will, sometimes we do the public first, sometimes we do us first, or us at the beginning and the end, and I don't really have a preference, but I just want to know what it is so that we don't just move on and none of us have asked our question.

467
01:30:10,188 --> 01:30:19,791
I want to let the student representatives speak, so it's up to the body if they'd like to speak first, or I would like to hear from the residents, and three minutes each, one turn each.

468
01:30:20,311 --> 01:30:30,514
My preference certainly is the public first, but... Motion to let the public speak first by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

469
01:30:30,534 --> 01:30:31,294
All those in favor?

470
01:30:31,874 --> 01:30:32,134
Aye.

471
01:30:32,174 --> 01:30:32,434
Thank you.

472
01:30:32,794 --> 01:30:38,796
Would anybody else like to speak on this matter, or have a question on the presentation?

473
01:30:47,045 --> 01:30:48,845
Just your name and address for the record, please.

474
01:30:50,906 --> 01:30:51,266
Good evening.

475
01:30:51,606 --> 01:30:52,546
I'm Katie Rotrammel.

476
01:30:53,107 --> 01:30:55,547
I live at 15 Blaisdell Road in Medford, Massachusetts.

477
01:30:57,388 --> 01:30:57,848
Good evening.

478
01:30:58,368 --> 01:31:01,889
My name is Katie Rotrammel, and I'm a senior at Medford Public High School.

479
01:31:02,629 --> 01:31:06,130
My presence tonight serves the purpose of making an effort to improve.

480
01:31:07,190 --> 01:31:14,572
An effort to improve the efficacy of this student-led movement, an effort to amplify voices whose words are repeatedly disregarded as noise.

481
01:31:15,922 --> 01:31:17,925
An effort to do what I can for us.

482
01:31:19,006 --> 01:31:23,371
I understand that there are elements of this process that transcend individual action.

483
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:27,917
In fact, there are very few elements that lie solely on one person or group.

484
01:31:28,778 --> 01:31:34,205
But I also understand that asking for this effort to be reciprocated is not only appropriate but critical.

485
01:31:35,066 --> 01:31:43,110
In any movement, there will be participants who are involved with malintent or simply to attract attention to themselves rather than the issue at hand.

486
01:31:44,111 --> 01:31:58,899
I have spoken in depth with Assistant Superintendent Dr. Peter Cushing, as well as Principal Paul DeLeva, regarding my stance and the stance of the students whom I stand with here tonight on the performative behavior of those who show interest in this cause for the wrong reasons.

487
01:31:59,779 --> 01:32:07,605
I am asking you all, as elected officials who have promised to work for the students and families of Medford, to make the same effort.

488
01:32:08,806 --> 01:32:19,515
Though the details of this case are extremely important in serving justice, I continue to see these details used to dismiss the overarching concern of us as students.

489
01:32:20,575 --> 01:32:23,838
I am not educated to speak on the legal processes of this case.

490
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:28,762
I am not qualified to speak over the voice of the victim in this specific incident.

491
01:32:29,517 --> 01:32:37,900
but I am obligated to demand the attention of those who have made a promise to provide students with an education when they continue to fail.

492
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:40,781
I will not apologize for yelling.

493
01:32:41,561 --> 01:32:54,806
I will not apologize for the desperation of my peers and I, as we stood outside last Wednesday, December 1st, afraid of receiving the same punishment as the student who sent said victim to the hospital just one day prior.

494
01:32:55,993 --> 01:33:07,998
I will not apologize for the tears shed by students who have experienced domestic violence firsthand, or for the angry words exclaimed by voices who are not heard until they offend the ears of those in power.

495
01:33:09,118 --> 01:33:15,200
I believe that my peers would agree with me in saying that we do not ask for an apology on behalf of the administration.

496
01:33:16,061 --> 01:33:21,843
The five letters that create the word sorry do not keep children from being attacked in your hallways.

497
01:33:22,725 --> 01:33:31,350
They do not alter the insults and threats uttered by teachers and safety officers as we walked through those front doors at 11 a.m.

498
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:32,751
less than one week ago.

499
01:33:33,772 --> 01:33:35,453
Sorry does not earn our trust.

500
01:33:36,393 --> 01:33:47,900
Our attendance tonight offers a chance for the administration and school committee to make plans, to take action, and to give the students who you promised to serve a reason to trust you.

501
01:33:48,981 --> 01:33:49,741
Thank you for your time.

502
01:33:52,595 --> 01:33:52,935
Thank you.

503
01:34:03,024 --> 01:34:03,384
Thank you.

504
01:34:04,004 --> 01:34:07,968
Anybody else like to Speak before we open it up to the floor.

505
01:34:10,329 --> 01:34:11,610
We appreciate everybody being here.

506
01:34:12,411 --> 01:34:14,833
We're as concerned as you all are, and we

507
01:34:22,315 --> 01:34:23,235
I have lots of questions.

508
01:34:25,016 --> 01:34:26,217
First, I'd like to thank Ms.

509
01:34:26,277 --> 01:34:26,897
Puccio and Ms.

510
01:34:27,457 --> 01:34:27,978
Retromel.

511
01:34:30,119 --> 01:34:42,124
I know speaking at the podium isn't really, well, always easy, and I appreciate the details, and I also greatly appreciate getting a copy of one of the statements.

512
01:34:42,164 --> 01:34:45,485
I look forward to the other one, because a second time through is always helpful.

513
01:34:47,426 --> 01:34:49,047
I do have a couple of sort of

514
01:34:49,912 --> 01:34:51,833
technical questions, and I don't know the answers.

515
01:34:51,873 --> 01:34:56,775
I'm not asking them to be facetious, but I'm hoping Dr. Cushing can answer them.

516
01:34:56,795 --> 01:35:08,441
Because there's certainly questions that I've seen asked on social media, they have been asked tonight, and I'm asking them because I wanted somebody with a definitive answer.

517
01:35:08,461 --> 01:35:18,626
So one of the questions that I have is, privacy laws and all that other stuff, I think there's a lot of misunderstanding,

518
01:35:20,837 --> 01:35:22,638
Maybe there isn't, I don't know.

519
01:35:23,058 --> 01:35:24,979
But my question is really simple.

520
01:35:25,579 --> 01:35:34,182
Can a victim be told what the punishment was that was given to somebody who harmed them if we assume that there was a perpetrator, if you will?

521
01:35:34,503 --> 01:35:36,123
Can they be told what the punishment was?

522
01:35:37,204 --> 01:35:38,244
The answer is no.

523
01:35:39,324 --> 01:35:45,447
Federal FERPA protects student privacy even for the victim.

524
01:35:47,037 --> 01:36:00,365
doesn't prevent us in speaking in broad terms of various things that may happen, but privacy laws prevent us from disclosing anything about a student's record as it pertains to discipline.

525
01:36:01,105 --> 01:36:01,405
Thank you.

526
01:36:01,886 --> 01:36:05,107
What's the acronym for FERPA, point of information?

527
01:36:05,208 --> 01:36:11,171
Federal Education Rights Privacy Act, if I remember under the microscope now.

528
01:36:12,366 --> 01:36:23,072
Thank you and I asked the question, I wasn't really quite sure, because, you know, if anybody's been victimized, knowing.

529
01:36:24,175 --> 01:36:28,177
that there was an appropriate response is really important.

530
01:36:28,677 --> 01:36:36,361
And for adults, when that happens, there's the news, there's the court filings, there's all that other stuff.

531
01:36:37,141 --> 01:36:39,482
And FERPA obviously has nothing to do with anything.

532
01:36:40,983 --> 01:36:43,624
And we are accustomed to being able to know that.

533
01:36:44,164 --> 01:36:50,187
And actually I think victims of crimes like are given this information purposefully.

534
01:36:51,408 --> 01:37:08,273
because they kind of deserve it, but in the under 18 crowd, whether they deserve it or not isn't really relevant because they can't have it, and I just think that's an awful place for us to be, but it is what it is and I just want everybody to understand that because I've just.

535
01:37:10,146 --> 01:37:14,628
know, it's just been a lot of online commentary about this.

536
01:37:15,669 --> 01:37:21,892
And, you know, this, I've noticed that none of the school committee members have had a statement on what's been going on.

537
01:37:22,653 --> 01:37:24,934
And, and somebody asked me why.

538
01:37:24,954 --> 01:37:27,195
And I said, because we don't know what's going on.

539
01:37:27,255 --> 01:37:31,737
We don't have the rights as a school committee to know anything about this case at all.

540
01:37:32,418 --> 01:37:34,519
No more rights than anybody else living in Medford.

541
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:36,780
And so

542
01:37:38,661 --> 01:37:43,523
you know, that makes it uncomfortable because people would assume we know lots of things that we do not know.

543
01:37:44,403 --> 01:37:54,826
And I think it's important for the community to know that we don't know all this stuff and we're keeping it to ourselves or we're, you know, being coy or anything else.

544
01:37:54,966 --> 01:38:00,748
We don't know, we should not be asking, and certainly we should not be told if we were to ask.

545
01:38:02,208 --> 01:38:06,750
And, you know, I just think that's really important to be clear

546
01:38:10,316 --> 01:38:21,503
I had a lot of other stuff that was from the presentation, actually, not so much there, but I don't know if we wanna do the questions on the presentation now, because mine are really just a small set of those.

547
01:38:21,623 --> 01:38:25,045
Okay, so- Can I ask a question and we can have, we can go- Yeah, member to member.

548
01:38:26,006 --> 01:38:29,648
I'll ask one question then, one more question and we'll move on.

549
01:38:29,668 --> 01:38:35,431
I also wanna thank the community members that have stepped up to be substitute teachers.

550
01:38:35,472 --> 01:38:39,194
I know a couple of them and I know that it was a huge,

551
01:38:42,357 --> 01:38:45,678
I had a lot of conversations with one person who decided to do it.

552
01:38:46,138 --> 01:38:57,640
It's a hard thing to, you know, you've not been teaching or you're not in the workforce right now and to volunteer to be a substitute when then the news makes it sounds like being a teacher is going into a war zone every day.

553
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:59,360
It's a huge thing.

554
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:04,381
And I would just encourage anybody else who might be thinking about it.

555
01:39:04,421 --> 01:39:08,642
Look, if you try it and you don't like it nobody's gonna be angry, but

556
01:39:09,082 --> 01:39:13,844
You might like it and we really, really, really need you to do that.

557
01:39:14,944 --> 01:39:16,545
And I also wanna thank our staff.

558
01:39:18,285 --> 01:39:30,490
When we talk about the lack of mental health services in the community, our staff are doing these evaluations, determining kids need services and then sending them back to class because guess what?

559
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:31,350
There's no services.

560
01:39:31,991 --> 01:39:38,073
So that means that the teachers are dealing with kids that are having unmet needs

561
01:39:39,113 --> 01:39:41,394
And that's just the way it's gonna be.

562
01:39:42,595 --> 01:39:46,477
There's no magical group of counselors for us to hire.

563
01:39:46,497 --> 01:39:50,819
And it's horrible and it's ugly.

564
01:39:51,019 --> 01:40:03,946
And I just really wanna thank the staff that deal with this every day that are trying to help the students to the best of, but I mean, most of these referrals out of the school system are for things that our staff are not trained to do.

565
01:40:06,096 --> 01:40:11,579
So, but they still have the students and they're doing their best and I just think it's really important to thank them for that.

566
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:13,941
I'll stop because I have lots of other questions.

567
01:40:14,721 --> 01:40:15,562
Thank you, member Rousseau.

568
01:40:17,843 --> 01:40:19,844
Does member Kratz?

569
01:40:20,484 --> 01:40:21,445
Yes.

570
01:40:21,605 --> 01:40:25,447
I want to thank both students for coming out this evening and speaking.

571
01:40:25,927 --> 01:40:26,748
Thank you very much.

572
01:40:26,988 --> 01:40:32,391
And I just had a question because I've been seeing some chatter on Facebook about

573
01:40:32,970 --> 01:40:35,831
whether or not we still have a school resource officer.

574
01:40:35,851 --> 01:40:39,132
So I just wanted to maybe clear up some confusion on that.

575
01:40:41,113 --> 01:40:42,854
Would you be able to help answer that question?

576
01:40:44,654 --> 01:40:47,375
So we do still have a school resource officer.

577
01:40:48,816 --> 01:40:54,578
There's been some health concerns and personnel matters.

578
01:40:55,338 --> 01:40:58,980
So, but that should be clearing up very soon.

579
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:02,241
But yes, we do have a school resource officer.

580
01:41:03,649 --> 01:41:11,979
To to miss Kratz we have one who's working from the station and one that is I don't know at the high school, but I know he's been at the Andrews lately, yes.

581
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:13,401
Okay, thank you.

582
01:41:20,458 --> 01:41:20,898
Member Rousseau.

583
01:41:21,259 --> 01:41:22,981
Oh, sorry, Member Stone and Member Rousseau.

584
01:41:23,261 --> 01:41:24,682
All right, thanks, Mayor.

585
01:41:24,963 --> 01:41:30,588
If I could just ask the students, if you're comfortable, both of you had referred to moving forward and taking action.

586
01:41:30,648 --> 01:41:37,995
Could you tell us what you shared with the administration, what you would like to see happen at the high school, if you feel comfortable?

587
01:41:38,016 --> 01:41:41,379
Or send me an email with what you shared with them.

588
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:43,301
Okay, great, thank you.

589
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:57,078
I think with that was communicate more communication and continued focus groups to brainstorm ideas on how to fix the school culture, which it seems that administration is committed to.

590
01:41:57,984 --> 01:42:00,765
Yes, and leveraging the student voice.

591
01:42:01,465 --> 01:42:04,806
I had the opportunity to participate in several conversations as well.

592
01:42:05,546 --> 01:42:18,529
And they were really, you know, great suggestions of leveraging, you know, the class presidents and just creating additional opportunities for student voice.

593
01:42:18,549 --> 01:42:24,970
So I felt like it was very positive suggestions, positive feedback.

594
01:42:25,630 --> 01:42:33,914
And again, what I had said in my remarks earlier, but I also reiterated it to the student groups that I was part of, to partner with them.

595
01:42:34,394 --> 01:42:48,021
If they see something, if they hear something to notify an adult, because some events, you know, happen and there's nothing we can do about it, but some events are scheduled or planned events.

596
01:42:48,801 --> 01:42:58,606
And when students go to a certain area to observe a planned event, if an adult knew, we would have been able to have intervened before that event took place.

597
01:42:59,327 --> 01:43:04,430
So we're working on trying to create those opportunities.

598
01:43:08,192 --> 01:43:08,692
One last thing.

599
01:43:08,752 --> 01:43:11,713
I know Mr. Cushing talked about staff shortages.

600
01:43:13,074 --> 01:43:17,036
Is there any light at the end of the tunnel for any sort of

601
01:43:18,863 --> 01:43:33,352
subcontracting with maybe an employment agency, or I know I've heard students talk about hall monitors, which I can't, we don't have enough powers of substitutes, but is there any, I guess, hope for more staff?

602
01:43:36,374 --> 01:43:38,896
Mr. McLaughlin, the microphone, please.

603
01:43:43,953 --> 01:43:44,173
Thank you.

604
01:43:44,194 --> 01:43:45,476
I was about to use my teacher voice.

605
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:50,005
It's something that we're clearly actively working on.

606
01:43:50,045 --> 01:43:51,428
We have been all year long.

607
01:43:51,908 --> 01:43:54,473
I will say that the first job fair that we hosted,

608
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:58,801
yielded 22 new quarries.

609
01:43:59,361 --> 01:44:05,044
So HR has been in the process of onboarding all of those 22 people.

610
01:44:05,184 --> 01:44:08,286
Some were interested in daily substitute positions.

611
01:44:08,986 --> 01:44:19,691
Some were interested in more permanent positions like a paraprofessional or SSAs, because they might only be able to commit to like half days or a day here or there through the week.

612
01:44:19,731 --> 01:44:21,112
But we were pretty pleased with 22.

613
01:44:21,152 --> 01:44:24,214
And part of the ongoing conversation is,

614
01:44:25,054 --> 01:44:27,175
doing another one come January.

615
01:44:27,195 --> 01:44:37,022
This is the time where some college, we get some assistance from college students that come home, but we're just actively working on it.

616
01:44:37,082 --> 01:44:41,464
It's continuously posted on our website and we're looking to host another job fair.

617
01:44:41,484 --> 01:44:47,248
But I do know that the 22, some of them have been actively working already.

618
01:44:47,268 --> 01:44:48,449
Yeah.

619
01:44:50,538 --> 01:44:50,878
Thank you.

620
01:44:50,938 --> 01:44:51,399
Member Graham.

621
01:44:53,141 --> 01:45:02,392
Can you just clarify for me how many school counselors, how many adjustment counselors, and how many school psychologists are at the high school right now?

622
01:45:06,477 --> 01:45:08,979
Currently, we have six school counselors.

623
01:45:09,977 --> 01:45:14,799
for school adjustment counselors to school psychologists full time.

624
01:45:15,379 --> 01:45:20,581
And how does that compare to what we would expect to see in a high school of our size?

625
01:45:21,342 --> 01:45:28,765
So right now, the only recommendation for counseling caseloads is related to school counselors, so guidance counselors.

626
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:32,982
And our school counselors have a caseload of around 200.

627
01:45:34,082 --> 01:45:38,664
The maximum recommendation from the Mass Association of School Counselors is 250.

628
01:45:40,245 --> 01:45:43,426
So on that perspective for that ratio, we are doing quite well.

629
01:45:44,227 --> 01:45:46,367
The adjustment counselor caseloads are quite high.

630
01:45:46,387 --> 01:45:52,650
And it's very difficult when you talk about this to set numbers, because we're talking about human beings.

631
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:55,391
So if you have a counseling caseload of 50 students,

632
01:45:56,812 --> 01:46:05,235
You may, you know, those students might be check-ins throughout the week, or you may have students who you are with a lot of the day because they're going through crisis.

633
01:46:06,016 --> 01:46:10,037
I will say, I am incredibly grateful to our counseling team.

634
01:46:10,237 --> 01:46:13,518
They are working constantly throughout the day.

635
01:46:14,019 --> 01:46:15,299
I have never seen them work harder.

636
01:46:15,799 --> 01:46:19,761
They are one of the smartest counseling teams that I've seen and worked with.

637
01:46:22,342 --> 01:46:25,023
I don't think the answer is always to add more counselors.

638
01:46:26,155 --> 01:46:36,406
I think that we all need to work together, but right now comparing us to other schools, every school would say they always want more counselors.

639
01:46:37,868 --> 01:46:47,618
So I think the other question I have is, is it clear to students and families how to engage with these supports at school?

640
01:46:48,516 --> 01:46:51,357
So we've heard from students this week that they don't know.

641
01:46:51,838 --> 01:46:54,019
And so we are working to get them that information.

642
01:46:54,059 --> 01:46:56,240
We have an advisory coming up this Thursday.

643
01:46:56,260 --> 01:46:58,841
A lot of it will be, who are the counselors in the building?

644
01:46:58,901 --> 01:46:59,641
How do you get to them?

645
01:47:00,181 --> 01:47:03,723
Every single student has a school counselor, and that's on their school grants account.

646
01:47:04,043 --> 01:47:05,984
And we'll be sending this message out to families as well.

647
01:47:08,525 --> 01:47:17,890
And how do we make sure that families who are experiencing crisis of some kind, big or small,

648
01:47:19,656 --> 01:47:24,880
can come to us with those concerns and get help.

649
01:47:26,121 --> 01:47:34,388
And I say that because I've heard from people over the last couple of days who feel like they are reaching out to try to get help.

650
01:47:35,189 --> 01:47:40,213
And there's a lot of sympathy for what's going on for them, but

651
01:47:42,443 --> 01:47:50,927
saying to people, we're here if you need us, tell us what you need is often not sufficient for somebody who's going through something they've never experienced before.

652
01:47:51,067 --> 01:48:02,112
So that just really struck a chord with me that if parents are reaching out because they don't know what to do, we have to find a way.

653
01:48:02,132 --> 01:48:11,296
And I'm not saying necessarily that the school has to provide the thing that fills the gap, but parents by and large are not trained counselors and

654
01:48:11,837 --> 01:48:20,563
there's a real opportunity for us as a district to help them understand what to do, where to go, who to reach out to, how school can help.

655
01:48:21,123 --> 01:48:23,005
And I feel like we're not getting that right.

656
01:48:24,306 --> 01:48:34,092
And I feel like, you know, family members, community members who are struggling with whatever they may be struggling with feel sort of lost.

657
01:48:34,193 --> 01:48:35,674
And I think that's sort of a bigger

658
01:48:36,906 --> 01:48:44,188
There's a problem in our culture right like when people have problems, particularly that are that rise to the level of crisis.

659
01:48:45,389 --> 01:48:50,290
There's, there's a lot of folks who don't want to reach out for help because they're, they're concerned about what that looks like.

660
01:48:52,091 --> 01:48:58,374
I think what I've been hearing is that there are some folks out there who want the help and feel like they're not getting it.

661
01:48:59,014 --> 01:49:10,499
And then there are some folks who don't feel like they have a level of trust or connection to our school system to think that we could provide help.

662
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:11,380
And I think

663
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:18,825
that to me is like just another symptom of some of the systemic things that are broken that we need to fix.

664
01:49:19,346 --> 01:49:25,590
And we really need to think about how do we actually have a good relationship with families?

665
01:49:26,291 --> 01:49:36,539
And I think we've done a lot in the last couple of years to try to move there, but we still have such a long way to go that I want to encourage you and others

666
01:49:37,259 --> 01:49:43,301
Whether it's at budget time or if it's something that you need more urgently and it can't wait till next year.

667
01:49:44,061 --> 01:49:56,825
If there are supports and resources that you need to start to create that kind of relationship with families, we want to hear about it because I speak for myself, I think that's critically important.

668
01:49:57,425 --> 01:50:01,766
We need school and families to be on the same page and I don't feel like we are right now.

669
01:50:03,644 --> 01:50:04,825
I mean, you make excellent points.

670
01:50:04,945 --> 01:50:09,969
And I think that's what we need to really work on now is getting the voice and hearing those concerns.

671
01:50:10,149 --> 01:50:11,970
We spent a lot of time with students this week.

672
01:50:11,990 --> 01:50:13,291
We're spending more time with students.

673
01:50:13,311 --> 01:50:23,959
We need to spend time with staff and with families to say, what are your concerns and why, you know, either you don't know who to talk to or you don't feel like your voice is going to be heard and we need to work on fixing that.

674
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:30,904
And I think the other thing I wanted to mention that really both of our students alluded to was

675
01:50:33,422 --> 01:50:49,927
that in the midst of our students saying to us, something is wrong here, that the overwhelming thing that they felt was that they faced like potential retaliation or potential consequences.

676
01:50:51,168 --> 01:51:00,531
And so to the conversation around trust, certainly we need to be an organization that has

677
01:51:01,536 --> 01:51:07,578
clear consequences when the rules are broken that fit the situation.

678
01:51:08,298 --> 01:51:23,804
But the fact that our students trying to do something to make their school environment better came here to tell us that the first thing they felt was like they were gonna be retaliated against in some way is really disheartening.

679
01:51:23,824 --> 01:51:29,046
And I don't know what we need to do to fix that, but I think it's critically important that

680
01:51:30,066 --> 01:51:37,552
we create students for the right now and for the future who are willing to make their environments better.

681
01:51:37,572 --> 01:51:47,539
And they can't do that if they're afraid of retaliation in school, which is supposed to be a safe place to learn how to do these things effectively.

682
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:59,469
So I'd like to hear a little bit more about what we're doing to fix that problem as well, because it's really, really,

683
01:52:01,155 --> 01:52:10,783
disheartening and sad that our students felt like they, of all the comments, both of them at the top of your comments talked about that.

684
01:52:10,903 --> 01:52:21,572
So that means that really sticks out to our students and we need that not to be the first thing they want to tell us when they come here to address some issue that they're experiencing in school.

685
01:52:24,051 --> 01:52:26,012
So I'd like to address that.

686
01:52:26,293 --> 01:52:35,058
And while Katie mentioned in her statement that sorry, in the five letters really don't mean anything until you build trust.

687
01:52:36,439 --> 01:52:42,023
I do want to publicly apologize for any member of our organization that said that a student would be disciplined or suspended.

688
01:52:42,083 --> 01:52:47,066
That was not the message that Mr. DeLava, Mr. Fallon, myself, the superintendent put out.

689
01:52:47,726 --> 01:52:54,390
and I think it's an unfortunate consequence of how schools may have operated in the past.

690
01:52:54,651 --> 01:53:08,799
When students feel that their voice is not heard to the point where they need to have a walkout or a sit-in or some other type of action, then we need to do a better job and we

691
01:53:10,461 --> 01:53:12,502
are not going to threaten students with suspension.

692
01:53:12,722 --> 01:53:38,273
I'd like to go back to the presentation just briefly that the students have never seen that when we're talking about discipline and supporting students, the narrowly tailored focus of student discipline, be it detention, be it suspension or whatever it may be, does not include students who are peacefully protesting when their voice hasn't been heard.

693
01:53:39,293 --> 01:54:01,959
And so we will work and we will redouble our efforts with all of our faculty and staff, our monitors, our security personnel, and everyone to make sure that if something like this again happens in the future, say something different about safety, about making sure that you're acting appropriately, and we will be here to listen and to act upon it.

694
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:03,860
Thank you.

695
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:07,761
Thank you, Member Graham.

696
01:54:08,956 --> 01:54:09,717
Member McLaughlin.

697
01:54:10,797 --> 01:54:11,218
Thank you.

698
01:54:11,718 --> 01:54:15,121
I want to thank the students for coming up tonight and speaking as well.

699
01:54:15,241 --> 01:54:19,004
I think to other members' points, if you're

700
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:21,902
feel like you're speaking up, but your voice is not heard.

701
01:54:22,402 --> 01:54:23,964
It's a matter of re-victimization.

702
01:54:24,884 --> 01:54:30,529
And I am so encouraged, though, by Dr. Cushion creating the Student Advisory Council.

703
01:54:30,549 --> 01:54:38,475
I know it was a matter of law, and it's really wonderful that it's actually happening this year, and it's happening at the high school and expanding to the middle school.

704
01:54:38,575 --> 01:54:39,236
It's critical.

705
01:54:39,936 --> 01:54:48,583
I was able to sit in on one of those sessions with a few of the student advisory folks, and I thought it was really revelatory in terms of what they were telling

706
01:54:50,503 --> 01:54:53,024
us as an adult and what they were willing to share.

707
01:54:53,064 --> 01:54:59,426
I was so really proud of them and this generation, and I have full faith in their generation, much more so than my own, I have to say.

708
01:55:00,406 --> 01:55:03,448
So keep doing what you're doing, students, and we need to hear from you.

709
01:55:03,488 --> 01:55:07,409
We need to know what it is we need to do to make things better here.

710
01:55:07,849 --> 01:55:11,111
I also want to encourage folks to ask who's not at the table.

711
01:55:11,731 --> 01:55:14,312
So when you're having those meetings, you know, I did hear sort of

712
01:55:15,743 --> 01:55:19,987
in the background from some folks that certain students are being asked or you know.

713
01:55:21,209 --> 01:55:24,192
The same people are coming to the table, and I would say who's not at the table.

714
01:55:24,787 --> 01:55:31,790
And I would encourage the students to ask that question too, who's not at the table, who are we, you know, maybe not including, and how do we think about including them?

715
01:55:31,810 --> 01:55:43,436
And so I wanna make sure that any of the material that is being sent out, that's been talked about in terms of creating advisory groups, what have you, certainly are translated.

716
01:55:43,476 --> 01:55:52,160
I know that Mr. Teixeira was involved with the focus groups, and I know that Joan Bowen and I spoke about doing some, the,

717
01:55:53,520 --> 01:56:02,402
special education department doing some social stories for some of the students who need them around how to be involved and how their voice can be heard as well.

718
01:56:02,842 --> 01:56:11,164
So I just want to make sure that we're being inclusive of those voices because I really want to hear and see them see the change that they can make.

719
01:56:11,504 --> 01:56:11,844
Thank you.

720
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:15,045
Member Rousseau.

721
01:56:15,665 --> 01:56:16,005
Thank you.

722
01:56:18,609 --> 01:56:20,871
Thank you, Member Graham, for asking those questions about the numbers.

723
01:56:20,951 --> 01:56:23,292
Do we have any social workers in the high school?

724
01:56:24,253 --> 01:56:25,833
School adjustment counselors are social workers.

725
01:56:25,893 --> 01:56:26,274
Thank you.

726
01:56:26,614 --> 01:56:27,374
You're welcome.

727
01:56:27,394 --> 01:56:28,635
That answers that question.

728
01:56:29,315 --> 01:56:34,778
And then all my other questions are really about the presentation and the exclusion.

729
01:56:34,798 --> 01:56:45,705
And I'm gonna save those for subcommittee, I think, because there's a lot in here I just don't think really

730
01:56:46,570 --> 01:56:52,715
matched up with our conversation over a year ago, but this is probably not the right meeting for that.

731
01:56:52,755 --> 01:57:00,281
I do just want to point out around exclusion, you know, and data, because I mean, it matters.

732
01:57:00,801 --> 01:57:11,870
I went and looked at the Department of Ed's data just before our meeting tonight, and it says that since 2013, we've actually had zero expulsions in our school system.

733
01:57:13,472 --> 01:57:14,933
I would like to believe that's true,

734
01:57:16,170 --> 01:57:29,495
I think more likely what's happening is our reporting is abysmal, and I don't put that on any individuals particularly, but I know of specific suspensions that occurred in the elementary level that do not show up in that reporting.

735
01:57:30,075 --> 01:57:42,439
So I think it's really important for people to understand that when we talk about exclusion and suspension, we're talking about the stuff that's actually happening, not what's on the website for the Department of Ed, and the differences are shocking.

736
01:57:44,110 --> 01:57:48,234
the differences and what's really happening versus what's showing up on that website.

737
01:57:48,714 --> 01:57:55,739
And I think some of it's related to the data systems that we have and how they're all connected and how things get coded.

738
01:57:55,960 --> 01:58:03,005
But I just, this issue of suspensions is much bigger than if you just go look at our website.

739
01:58:03,085 --> 01:58:06,688
So I'll save the rest of my questions for subcommittee.

740
01:58:07,504 --> 01:58:08,405
Thank you, Mr. Rousseau.

741
01:58:09,365 --> 01:58:11,166
Member Van de Kloot.

742
01:58:11,486 --> 01:58:26,894
Yes, just in response to my colleague, I will tell you that I know that over the years that there's been any number of times where parents have chosen to withdraw their child before an expulsion because they didn't want an expulsion on the record.

743
01:58:27,494 --> 01:58:29,115
And so it's a very interesting

744
01:58:29,910 --> 01:58:35,717
area, but that could account for some of the differences that have happened in the past.

745
01:58:36,758 --> 01:58:46,309
I did want to thank the students who spoke out clearly tonight, and to all of the students who've been articulate during this period of time.

746
01:58:46,869 --> 01:59:01,258
I will tell you that as the events unfolded, I did go and have conversations with key people just to make sure I felt comfortable that I knew that our staff was handling it.

747
01:59:01,438 --> 01:59:16,187
And I even drove by from a distance when there was a walkout on Friday, observing then the superintendent, Dr. Cushing, and many of our other administrators talking to the groups of students engaged in conversation.

748
01:59:16,787 --> 01:59:20,890
and getting the sort of feedback which will only be more helpful to us as we go on.

749
01:59:21,450 --> 01:59:32,797
So I appreciate your work, and I appreciate the students coming forth and being active, because that's what it's ultimately going to take for us to improve the current climate.

750
01:59:33,617 --> 01:59:38,940
It's been a difficult time for everybody and we are not unique.

751
01:59:40,427 --> 01:59:45,288
the sort of issues that we're facing in Medford right now are being faced across the country.

752
01:59:45,908 --> 02:00:02,292
And while that in no means makes it okay, I think it's an interesting thing to understand the dynamics of society right now and how they're affecting our kids and why it's so important that we listen to them.

753
02:00:04,532 --> 02:00:05,672
Thank you, Member Van de Kloot.

754
02:00:05,812 --> 02:00:08,153
And just if I could from the chair,

755
02:00:10,030 --> 02:00:12,292
I'm very thankful for the two students that spoke up.

756
02:00:12,372 --> 02:00:19,177
And I also am thankful for everybody that's working hard, especially the last week or two to help change the culture.

757
02:00:19,197 --> 02:00:26,703
And I have heard that teachers are stepping up as well, you know, after class exits, they're more visible in the hallway.

758
02:00:26,743 --> 02:00:29,085
And I think that does help a lot.

759
02:00:29,125 --> 02:00:34,789
So thank you to all our staff and teachers and students who are working together to try to change the culture.

760
02:00:35,269 --> 02:00:37,411
And just as a school committee, if we could get,

761
02:00:38,072 --> 02:00:55,967
whether that's a monthly or at least maybe for the first few months, just a monthly update, even if it's by confidential email on, and I think Katie said it best, how we're gonna work to improve, plan, take action and build trust and obviously communicate better.

762
02:00:56,247 --> 02:01:00,731
I know the superintendent's Friday emails go a very long way with families.

763
02:01:00,931 --> 02:01:06,015
So maybe some of those ideas that come about are communications through the principal to students,

764
02:01:07,795 --> 02:01:19,502
to let people, let the students know what type of activities they can take part in, conversations they can be involved in to help bring this change that we do need and that we, I know we will get there.

765
02:01:20,102 --> 02:01:23,464
And I thank everybody for being involved and for listening to the students.

766
02:01:23,524 --> 02:01:25,805
They have the lived experiences to tell.

767
02:01:25,925 --> 02:01:28,066
And I think that's extremely important that you came forward.

768
02:01:28,226 --> 02:01:30,928
So monthly emails to us is,

769
02:01:31,567 --> 02:01:38,272
something that I would just request so we could stay involved and understand what's being done and help how we can.

770
02:01:39,373 --> 02:01:39,673
Thank you.

771
02:01:39,913 --> 02:01:41,274
Madam Superintendent.

772
02:01:41,754 --> 02:01:44,176
Did we get any emails from the public on this?

773
02:01:46,938 --> 02:01:49,440
We did not.

774
02:01:49,900 --> 02:02:00,748
Just prior to my leaving for the meeting, I checked and the only letter I had was from our student, Catherine, which you've all heard now and I sent to you.

775
02:02:01,510 --> 02:02:03,270
Thank you, Member Van de Kloet.

776
02:02:03,290 --> 02:02:04,051
Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

777
02:02:04,451 --> 02:02:16,653
So I also want to just say with this whole situation that happened, there's an expression that says, out of adversity comes opportunity.

778
02:02:17,533 --> 02:02:25,895
And as I think about the great opportunity that has happened is that we're having greater, more meaningful conversations with students.

779
02:02:26,435 --> 02:02:55,428
And for both Katie and Gabrielle, I would love to have them both come back in a few months to, I mean, Gabrielle, I know you'll be at meetings with us, but to be able to come back and share with the committee what differences, what changes they see and what their take is, their perspective, because this is a fresh perspective right now, but we want the change to not just be temporary,

780
02:02:56,009 --> 02:02:58,480
for it to become something that would be more permanent.

781
02:02:58,560 --> 02:02:59,785
So I do want to thank them.

782
02:03:01,303 --> 02:03:07,864
And I want to thank Katie for getting her copy of the letter to us a little earlier.

783
02:03:07,884 --> 02:03:12,685
And it was beautifully written.

784
02:03:12,825 --> 02:03:18,046
And I know once I see yours as well, Gabrielle, but I was like, the teacher in me was so excited.

785
02:03:18,106 --> 02:03:21,387
And I said, wow, we've got a wonderful writing scholar here.

786
02:03:21,407 --> 02:03:27,708
And I just want to continue to encourage student leadership because you are our future leaders.

787
02:03:28,608 --> 02:03:35,289
And again, out of this adversity comes opportunity, and we want to capitalize on that opportunity for Metro Public Schools.

788
02:03:35,649 --> 02:03:36,009
Thank you.

789
02:03:37,010 --> 02:03:38,130
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

790
02:03:38,390 --> 02:03:39,310
Thank you all for being here.

791
02:03:40,450 --> 02:03:42,551
Next up, we have Early Literacy Report.

792
02:03:42,571 --> 02:03:47,252
Assistant Superintendent Suzanne Galluzzi, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Ms.

793
02:03:47,292 --> 02:03:48,792
Suzanne Campbell, and Ms.

794
02:03:49,452 --> 02:03:54,673
Kathleen Champoli will provide an early literacy update on the alignment of the science of reading.

795
02:04:25,964 --> 02:04:26,124
Good.

796
02:04:27,364 --> 02:04:27,725
Awesome.

797
02:04:28,065 --> 02:04:28,365
Thank you.

798
02:04:29,365 --> 02:04:30,045
Hi, everyone.

799
02:04:31,246 --> 02:04:33,947
We're here tonight to give you an update on early literacy.

800
02:04:35,207 --> 02:04:43,710
Some form of this group here and also Diane Caldwell over the past two years has been here a number of times to talk about early literacy.

801
02:04:44,590 --> 02:04:49,292
This is actually our sixth time over the past two years in the past two school years here talking about early literacy.

802
02:04:49,872 --> 02:04:53,173
So we broke the tonight's presentation into four major parts.

803
02:04:53,213 --> 02:04:55,134
The first is just a little overview of

804
02:04:56,255 --> 02:05:00,921
Our previous presentations with the timeline and the names of each presentation.

805
02:05:00,941 --> 02:05:04,786
We will also give an overview of the science of reading.

806
02:05:05,967 --> 02:05:19,802
Then we'll talk about Medford's alignment with the science of reading, including a professional development initiatives, a brief discussion of NWA MAP, which stands for measures of academic performance and growth.

807
02:05:20,303 --> 02:05:26,289
On this slide here, we gave the acronyms of a lot of the language that we use because we know that not everyone

808
02:05:27,350 --> 02:05:29,252
speaks the same language as us sometimes.

809
02:05:29,653 --> 02:05:38,023
I once heard a parent say that she didn't speak school until she enrolled her students in school.

810
02:05:38,543 --> 02:05:43,008
And so I like to give acronyms when I can to make this process easier for everyone.

811
02:05:43,769 --> 02:05:55,661
So we'll also talk a little bit about Rapid Automatic Naming, Enhanced Core Reading Instruction, which is ECRI, Hegerty Phonemic Awareness, and MTSS, Multi-Tiered Systems of Support.

812
02:05:56,122 --> 02:05:58,564
Then we'll also give a little overview of our ongoing work.

813
02:06:02,197 --> 02:06:04,639
I we didn't introduce I didn't introduce.

814
02:06:04,859 --> 02:06:14,507
Okay, yes, so i'm katie champoli i'm the coordinator of special education for the brooks elementary school and for our preschool programs me.

815
02:06:16,522 --> 02:06:17,343
want to introduce yourselves?

816
02:06:17,363 --> 02:06:19,224
You want me to be the emcee here?

817
02:06:19,424 --> 02:06:21,046
Okay, all right.

818
02:06:21,086 --> 02:06:21,666
That's who I am.

819
02:06:21,746 --> 02:06:22,007
Thanks.

820
02:06:22,647 --> 02:06:40,182
So for our previous presentation dates, we were here twice in the fall of 2019, where we came to give a little bit of an overview of Governor Baker's legislation on dyslexia screening, and then to talk about the steps that Medford was taking towards early literacy screening.

821
02:06:40,902 --> 02:06:55,095
At that time, we discussed how Medford had gotten an early literacy grant in the summer of 2019 and early fall 2019, where at the Missituck, we were going to pilot map growth.

822
02:06:55,415 --> 02:07:03,282
And then at, subsequently, we got another grant for Lexia to be piloted at the McGlynn and the Brooks and the Roberts.

823
02:07:03,663 --> 02:07:06,525
And at that time, thanks to some,

824
02:07:08,140 --> 02:07:09,721
negotiation skills by Ms.

825
02:07:09,741 --> 02:07:18,145
Campbell and Dr. Chiesa, we were able to also get a free pilot of Lexia Core 5, which is the intervention tool that goes along with Lexia Rapid.

826
02:07:18,865 --> 02:07:28,210
We then came back in February 2020 to give an update where we discussed the early implementation of map growth and Lexia Rapid.

827
02:07:29,301 --> 02:07:42,296
At that time, we also discussed the professional development that had been going on during the 2019-2020 school year, including the district's partnership with Hill for Literacy, which is a literacy organization focused on the science of reading.

828
02:07:42,396 --> 02:07:50,305
So back then during 2019-2020, we had already begun that partnership and Hill had already begun to provide some PD to our staff.

829
02:07:51,434 --> 02:08:00,659
At that time, we also talked about interventions that we had begun to put into place, including Lexia Core 5 and ECRI, which was in the beginning stages in the district.

830
02:08:01,279 --> 02:08:04,501
We talked about our efforts to facilitate communication with stakeholders.

831
02:08:05,501 --> 02:08:10,784
And our next steps at that point, we had hopes to try to narrow down and choose a screener.

832
02:08:12,050 --> 02:08:16,116
We were hoping to get feedback from the teachers and select our new tool.

833
02:08:16,176 --> 02:08:23,449
We got interrupted by COVID, but then thankfully both NWEA, MAP, and Lexia continued our pilots for the next school year.

834
02:08:24,784 --> 02:08:28,026
And then we came back in March of 2021 with another update.

835
02:08:29,147 --> 02:08:42,895
Actually, that was part of the city's listening session on dyslexia that we were involved in, where we again gave an overview of the history of how we came to be doing this work and DESE's status on identifying the approved screeners.

836
02:08:42,975 --> 02:08:45,737
We talked about Medford screeners.

837
02:08:46,037 --> 02:08:53,622
We talked about the intervention that we were putting in place and MPS and multi-tiered systems of support.

838
02:08:55,208 --> 02:09:07,297
At that time, we also gave an overview of additional professional development, including continued work with the Hill for Literacy and answered questions from the community about our work.

839
02:09:09,016 --> 02:09:12,399
Then in October of this year, Ms.

840
02:09:12,419 --> 02:09:17,484
Galussi was here with Dr. Cushing, where they talked about the adoption of math K to 12 throughout the district.

841
02:09:18,504 --> 02:09:19,305
And Ms.

842
02:09:19,325 --> 02:09:29,754
Galussi also gave this committee a presentation about ECRI and the district's continued work with Hill for Literacy, which again, that's a group focused on the science of reading.

843
02:09:30,295 --> 02:09:32,317
And that segues nicely into Ms.

844
02:09:32,357 --> 02:09:36,020
Campbell's presentation here about the science of reading.

845
02:09:37,554 --> 02:09:37,994
Thank you, Ms.

846
02:09:38,014 --> 02:09:38,675
Champoli.

847
02:09:39,635 --> 02:09:40,536
Good evening, everyone.

848
02:09:40,676 --> 02:09:41,957
I'm Susanna Campbell.

849
02:09:42,277 --> 02:09:48,921
I am a special education coordinator for McGlynn Elementary and Middle School and district-wide coordinator of speech-language hearing services.

850
02:09:50,302 --> 02:09:57,951
So, as Katie was saying we will be focusing on the science of reading and this is a term that is used frequently in educational circles.

851
02:09:58,632 --> 02:10:07,703
This evening we will begin with an overview of the science of reading before we discuss how Medford has engaged staff and professional development on this topic.

852
02:10:08,544 --> 02:10:20,986
So the science of reading is a body of research that incorporates information from multiple disciplines, including reading experts, developmental psychologists, cognitive neuroscientists, and others.

853
02:10:21,546 --> 02:10:37,089
The science of reading provides educators with evidence-based methods, research-based methods that best help children learn how to read from the earliest steps in spoken language to being able to successfully decode unfamiliar words and context.

854
02:10:42,455 --> 02:10:46,478
Scientific reading instruction is comprised of five key components.

855
02:10:47,218 --> 02:10:50,600
Comprehension is one element of scientific reading instruction.

856
02:10:51,381 --> 02:10:57,085
In written language, comprehension refers to the understanding and interpretation of written text.

857
02:10:58,366 --> 02:11:02,789
Fluency is the ability to read with speed, accuracy, and expression.

858
02:11:03,169 --> 02:11:07,852
This element of reading is important in order to glean meaning from text.

859
02:11:09,229 --> 02:11:13,732
Vocabulary refers to understanding the meaning of the words on the page.

860
02:11:14,973 --> 02:11:22,118
Phonics allows us to understand the relationship between the letters of written language and the sounds of spoken language.

861
02:11:23,238 --> 02:11:30,403
Lastly, phonemic awareness refers to the ability to notice, think about, and work with the individual sounds of words.

862
02:11:31,444 --> 02:11:37,368
Please note that a student's ability to be a skilled reader is reliant on these interdependent skills.

863
02:11:42,864 --> 02:11:46,705
You see here an infographic that was created by Dr. Hollis Scarborough.

864
02:11:47,525 --> 02:11:50,646
She created the reading rope infographic in 2001.

865
02:11:51,406 --> 02:11:57,628
Dr. Scarborough is a leading researcher on early language development and its connection to later literacy.

866
02:11:58,628 --> 02:12:04,650
She created the reading rope to use during lectures for parents on the complexities involved in learning to read.

867
02:12:05,470 --> 02:12:09,471
And she spoke of skilled reading as resembling the strands of a rope.

868
02:12:10,424 --> 02:12:17,530
and she used pipe cleaners during her presentations to illustrate the interconnectedness and interdependence of these skills.

869
02:12:18,671 --> 02:12:21,713
The reading rope consists of lower and upper strands.

870
02:12:22,534 --> 02:12:36,805
The word recognition strands of phonological awareness, decoding, and sight recognition of familiar words work together as the reader becomes more accurate, fluent, and increasingly automatic with repetition and practice.

871
02:12:38,177 --> 02:12:55,722
At the same time, the language comprehension strands, which include background knowledge, vocabulary, language structures, verbal reasoning, and literacy knowledge, reinforce one another, and then weave together with the word recognition areas to produce a skilled reader.

872
02:12:56,702 --> 02:12:58,463
This does not happen overnight.

873
02:12:59,163 --> 02:13:02,744
It requires instruction and practice over time.

874
02:13:11,764 --> 02:13:19,189
As noted in the reading rope infographic, language comprehension continues to be an important component of skilled reading.

875
02:13:20,650 --> 02:13:28,875
In Medford, comprehension skills, the upper elements of the reading rope, are addressed using our core and supplementary academic curricula.

876
02:13:30,165 --> 02:13:54,916
specifically vocabulary knowledge, which includes making connections between new vocabulary words and other words that students already know, relating words to our own experiences, differentiating between correct and incorrect use of words, generating and answering questions that include these new words, et cetera, allows students to increase their vocabulary knowledge.

877
02:13:56,408 --> 02:14:04,354
Language structures are also addressed, and these allow students to track and understand the meaning within sentences.

878
02:14:05,195 --> 02:14:23,508
For example, students learn linguistic structures, such as pronouns, like she, he, they, them, lexical references, when you use a different word to mean the same thing, and connectives, such as and, also, because, so, them, before.

879
02:14:24,582 --> 02:14:30,409
Understanding these language structures is important in order to understand the text in front of you.

880
02:14:31,490 --> 02:14:33,913
Literacy knowledge builds over time.

881
02:14:34,713 --> 02:14:42,422
With our youngest students, it begins when children learn that books have words and words have letters and letters represent sounds.

882
02:14:43,363 --> 02:14:44,865
And this continues over time.

883
02:14:45,560 --> 02:14:52,404
so that our older students understand that there are various genres, including poetry, informational text, historical fiction, et cetera.

884
02:14:52,624 --> 02:14:56,846
And when they pick up a book, they know how to use it to gain the information that they need.

885
02:14:58,227 --> 02:15:05,111
In addition, verbal reasoning is addressed through the core and supplementary curricula.

886
02:15:05,951 --> 02:15:12,835
Children learn to identify and understand metaphors and similes, inferences, problem solving, and more.

887
02:15:16,598 --> 02:15:25,525
The scientific consensus around the science of reading is really focused on phonics.

888
02:15:27,066 --> 02:15:37,514
While comprehension continues to be a very important element, the scientific consensus is that a key element of the science of reading is the importance of phonics instruction.

889
02:15:38,709 --> 02:15:46,471
and that we need to teach phonics systematically, explicitly, and cumulatively in order to have successful readers.

890
02:15:53,424 --> 02:15:54,265
Good evening, everybody.

891
02:15:54,345 --> 02:15:57,066
I'm Nicole Chiesa, director of humanities K through 12.

892
02:15:58,227 --> 02:15:59,728
So the information that Ms.

893
02:15:59,748 --> 02:16:02,630
Campbell just provided to you is all very, very helpful.

894
02:16:03,190 --> 02:16:14,638
And I know that a question likely on your brain is it's important that we all know this as a community, but what work is being done with the teachers so that they know this information and therefore can apply it within our students.

895
02:16:14,738 --> 02:16:20,061
So I'm here to talk a little bit about the science of reading and Medford's alignment to the science of reading.

896
02:16:20,822 --> 02:16:22,202
So the professional development,

897
02:16:23,422 --> 02:16:29,184
with the science of reading is an initiative that we have been doing for the past few years with teachers.

898
02:16:29,784 --> 02:16:32,645
I will reference that in the next slide in just a moment.

899
02:16:33,345 --> 02:16:39,207
Another example of our alignment is by looking at those literacy screeners that Ms.

900
02:16:39,227 --> 02:16:44,048
Champoli just quickly reviewed, and as you have heard in numerous presentations.

901
02:16:45,189 --> 02:16:52,051
We have now selected NWEA map growth, which is going to allow us to look at the phonics

902
02:16:52,910 --> 02:16:56,711
all of the vocabulary, the comprehension, all of those components that Ms.

903
02:16:56,731 --> 02:17:07,475
Campbell just referenced for the science of reading and to gain a really strong understanding of do our students know this so that they can move on to the next steps.

904
02:17:08,016 --> 02:17:17,239
That's something that that map growth will provide to us so that we make sure we are not jumping ahead of ourselves when we are working with our students.

905
02:17:18,600 --> 02:17:22,161
We also going along with that have our automaticity screener.

906
02:17:22,674 --> 02:17:29,015
which is again going to give us a solid understanding of certain components supported by the science of reading.

907
02:17:31,116 --> 02:17:33,877
ECRI has been presented previously to you.

908
02:17:34,597 --> 02:17:46,559
And that is another example, a very strong example of how we are taking phonics and phonemic awareness and making sure it is implemented explicitly and systematically in our K through two classrooms.

909
02:17:47,400 --> 02:17:49,240
We also have Hegarty,

910
02:17:50,252 --> 02:17:53,834
which is something that we are working with at our tier two level.

911
02:17:54,714 --> 02:18:00,958
And we will talk about SOR as a foundation to our MTSS system.

912
02:18:03,579 --> 02:18:18,927
I won't go through this entire slide with you, but just some examples of professional development that we've done over the past few years with teachers and administrators include the importance of early identification and intervention by Dr. Gob,

913
02:18:20,287 --> 02:18:27,231
We have offered Desi-sponsored graduate credit courses to teachers, this particular one, Dyslexia, Dysgraphia, and Dyscalculia.

914
02:18:28,591 --> 02:18:37,316
We have had, for our entire staff, a presentation called Literacy and the Brain that was provided by Hill for Literacy for our entire K through five staff.

915
02:18:39,017 --> 02:18:48,882
We have also offered other professional development, including a PD called the Pillars of Reading, breaking down the elements of successful reading instruction.

916
02:18:50,083 --> 02:18:55,384
which again, we worked with with Hill for Literacy, as well as some of our own internal reading specialists.

917
02:18:56,444 --> 02:18:58,604
We have had Lexia Core 5 training.

918
02:18:59,705 --> 02:19:05,406
We have had significant amount of training for our early literacy screeners.

919
02:19:06,746 --> 02:19:19,348
And we're very excited this year to continue with our ECRI trainings and to provide classroom coaching to ensure that ECRI is being implemented in a thoughtful way so that

920
02:19:19,833 --> 02:19:24,116
teachers understand clearly how to implement it within the classroom.

921
02:19:25,456 --> 02:19:34,162
And we have also had Dr. Orkin from Crafting Minds present to our staff on evidence-based strategies for developing foundational reading skills.

922
02:19:38,104 --> 02:19:43,387
And those were some examples of the PD we offered to support the science of reading.

923
02:19:45,108 --> 02:19:46,309
As Dr. Cushing and Ms.

924
02:19:46,329 --> 02:19:49,391
Glucy presented to you a few weeks ago, I think,

925
02:19:49,844 --> 02:19:51,705
a few weeks ago, a month ago.

926
02:19:52,306 --> 02:20:02,134
We have chosen our early literacy screener, K through two, as well as K through 10, but we're focusing on K through two tonight, and WEA map growth.

927
02:20:02,734 --> 02:20:05,716
Now, as you know, this is a computer adaptive assessment.

928
02:20:05,916 --> 02:20:08,058
It's going to provide longitudinal data.

929
02:20:08,078 --> 02:20:11,161
It's going to identify instructional level.

930
02:20:11,241 --> 02:20:12,982
It's not gonna just zone in on mastery.

931
02:20:13,102 --> 02:20:17,986
It's going to tell the teachers, this is the level where the students are ready to learn.

932
02:20:19,434 --> 02:20:25,456
It's aligned to the Massachusetts curriculum framework, and it provides immediate and actionable literacy results.

933
02:20:28,417 --> 02:20:34,599
Very comprehensive results are one of the things that led us to our selection of MAP growth.

934
02:20:35,599 --> 02:20:38,841
MAP growth is going to give current achievement levels.

935
02:20:40,461 --> 02:20:49,124
It's going to give growth over time, so that if we have a student that may be a low achievement level, but is experiencing high growth

936
02:20:49,918 --> 02:20:55,563
Map growth is going to tell us that so that we know that what interventions we're using are working.

937
02:20:56,023 --> 02:21:06,732
Or the other way around, if we have a low achievement, low growth, we know we need to pause and make some shifts in our instruction so that the students can experience growth.

938
02:21:08,594 --> 02:21:14,619
Map growth is also going to give us future projections for MCAS when we get to the older grades, SATs.

939
02:21:16,198 --> 02:21:25,640
It's going to give us readability measures, and it's going to pull out these four different instructional areas, which I'm gonna show you in a moment, an example.

940
02:21:26,300 --> 02:21:30,861
It's going to provide the teachers with information for language and writing.

941
02:21:31,401 --> 02:21:41,122
We're going to know how the student is performing with grammar, writing purposes, main idea, for foundational skills, for vocabulary use and functions.

942
02:21:42,383 --> 02:21:44,223
And it's also going to look at

943
02:21:44,761 --> 02:21:49,722
the differences in ability between a literary piece and an informational text.

944
02:21:52,923 --> 02:21:56,824
This next slide, put my glasses on so I can look with you all.

945
02:21:57,564 --> 02:22:01,105
Hopefully I won't fog up or miss Lucy can do that.

946
02:22:01,505 --> 02:22:02,885
We have the family growth report.

947
02:22:03,325 --> 02:22:07,266
This is the report that will be sent to our K through two families.

948
02:22:08,698 --> 02:22:16,543
And as you see in this example, this is a student that has taken this test a few different times, so we're able to see growth.

949
02:22:17,164 --> 02:22:25,589
So this child, if we zone in on reading, it's telling us the reading achievement is 84% and the growth is high as well.

950
02:22:25,609 --> 02:22:27,771
So we're gonna be able to see achievement and growth.

951
02:22:27,831 --> 02:22:31,773
The families will be able to see that and they'll see it from mathematics as well.

952
02:22:32,994 --> 02:22:35,696
The next slide is going to zone more deeply

953
02:22:36,477 --> 02:22:38,698
into information for the teacher.

954
02:22:39,318 --> 02:22:49,321
It's going to show us that in those instructional areas that I just discussed, where does this student fall in vocabulary acquisition and use?

955
02:22:49,421 --> 02:22:51,801
How is the student doing with informational text?

956
02:22:52,522 --> 02:22:54,382
How is the student doing with literature?

957
02:22:54,822 --> 02:23:00,184
So it's taking that overall score and breaking it into different components so that we can see

958
02:23:00,879 --> 02:23:07,384
Even though this child might have been low achievement, the child is strong in vocabulary, for example.

959
02:23:07,424 --> 02:23:12,549
And so that helps us identify where we need to align and intervene.

960
02:23:14,710 --> 02:23:26,700
On the next slide, you're going to just see a nice projection as we continue to take this assessment over time, and we'll have a really solid look at the growth over time.

961
02:23:29,491 --> 02:23:37,836
As a teacher, I'm going to be able to, and administrator, I'm going to be able to look at these instructional areas.

962
02:23:38,516 --> 02:23:42,579
And it's not just going to tell me vocabulary acquisition and use, for example.

963
02:23:43,039 --> 02:23:46,921
It's going to zone more deeply into what falls into that.

964
02:23:46,981 --> 02:23:50,443
So we're going to be able to see academic and content vocabulary.

965
02:23:50,483 --> 02:23:53,064
So in this example, this student, which,

966
02:23:55,222 --> 02:23:59,703
the student is ready to develop certain skills within content vocabulary.

967
02:23:59,723 --> 02:24:04,644
So the teacher is going to have an understanding of where the child is ready to develop skills.

968
02:24:05,244 --> 02:24:07,004
And it's going to break out.

969
02:24:07,104 --> 02:24:11,285
So essentially it's breaking out those four instructional areas very deeply.

970
02:24:11,465 --> 02:24:20,867
And you can see on the next page, it's breaking out under vocabulary, where the child is ready to develop for unknown and multiple meaning words, categorization,

971
02:24:21,462 --> 02:24:31,991
These are just some examples, these slides, of how much information the teacher will get so that they can align their instruction effectively for the child.

972
02:24:36,635 --> 02:24:38,656
And then moving on, we have ECRI.

973
02:24:39,557 --> 02:24:48,665
This has already been presented to you, but as you know, we've adopted ECRI, and this is going to give us that K through two foundational skills

974
02:24:49,175 --> 02:24:52,936
which is an area where we needed to have more support on.

975
02:24:52,976 --> 02:25:00,239
So thanks to the generosity of school committee, we have been able to implement this within our K through two classrooms.

976
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:08,963
And we will continue to implement them through the coaching that is being done by Hill for Literacy.

977
02:25:10,123 --> 02:25:17,906
This graphic just essentially describes to you that ECRI uses systematic explicit and cumulative routines

978
02:25:18,427 --> 02:25:20,467
to teach phonics and build fluency.

979
02:25:20,968 --> 02:25:29,989
It's going to build upon letter names, the top of the tree, letter names, sound spelling cards, blending, regular word reading.

980
02:25:30,390 --> 02:25:42,212
And it's going to use all of these different systematic steps as the child attacks the decodable text reading that is available to them.

981
02:25:44,656 --> 02:25:53,762
And essentially this slide is taking everything from ECRI and saying, these are our inputs, spending quite a lot of time, important time on coaching.

982
02:25:55,343 --> 02:26:05,909
That's the teacher outcomes is that the teacher is going to have a strong knowledge base and is going to know the different pedagogical skills needed to teach foundational skills.

983
02:26:06,469 --> 02:26:13,694
And the student outcomes will be that improvement on academic achievement and also on social and emotional development.

984
02:26:15,509 --> 02:26:16,370
And with that, Ms.

985
02:26:16,390 --> 02:26:19,573
Galussi will share SOR and MTSS.

986
02:26:22,535 --> 02:26:22,956
Thank you.

987
02:26:22,996 --> 02:26:29,362
So when we've presented on this before, you've seen this graphic in some of our other presentations.

988
02:26:29,682 --> 02:26:34,586
I think the important piece here, Dr. Christian, if you could just, yes, thank you.

989
02:26:35,666 --> 02:26:44,590
I think the important piece with this graphic, this is part of the Department of Education's graphic to display the multi tiered system of support.

990
02:26:45,110 --> 02:26:54,835
You can just see here all the layers of how we are, what we're doing to address individual student needs, and that we're looking at all the tiers of what students need.

991
02:26:55,595 --> 02:27:11,443
So really quickly, what we're going to do in the next slides, the next few slides, is talk about how we are addressing student needs within every tier and how that envelops the science of reading for the early literacy grades.

992
02:27:12,782 --> 02:27:14,264
So the first slide, tier one.

993
02:27:14,885 --> 02:27:20,672
So everyone here has spoken about this piece, but here for tier one, that's all students.

994
02:27:20,832 --> 02:27:26,559
That's everyone in the classroom, all students together, learning during literacy.

995
02:27:27,400 --> 02:27:30,323
At the elementary level, there are two literacy blocks every day.

996
02:27:31,164 --> 02:27:34,347
One is for tier two and tier three intervention purposes.

997
02:27:34,807 --> 02:27:36,468
The other is whole group learning.

998
02:27:36,989 --> 02:27:39,631
During that whole group learning, that's when we're doing ECRI.

999
02:27:40,171 --> 02:27:46,516
So every single student is getting ECRI regardless of what their individual support system may be.

1000
02:27:47,717 --> 02:27:49,258
What are we using for tier one?

1001
02:27:49,698 --> 02:27:57,824
In addition to ECRI, we're also using the journeys materials, Lexia, Noozella, some of the supplemental materials we're pulling in as well.

1002
02:27:58,425 --> 02:27:59,606
It happens in the classroom.

1003
02:28:01,055 --> 02:28:08,120
Moving on to tier two, tier two can look different depending on the student.

1004
02:28:08,240 --> 02:28:14,004
Tier two can be a small group that the teacher pulls aside and the students are staying within their room.

1005
02:28:14,705 --> 02:28:17,687
Tier two could be for remediation as well as enrichment.

1006
02:28:18,527 --> 02:28:25,832
Tier two can also be students that may receive EL services as well as remedial reading services.

1007
02:28:26,393 --> 02:28:30,175
And so they just need a little, the next layer of support.

1008
02:28:31,056 --> 02:28:42,319
In terms of what we're doing for tier two to address the science of reading, this is where the Hegarty program has been brought in, because it is well aligned to the science of reading.

1009
02:28:42,339 --> 02:28:55,122
So students that are having a little bit of difficulty and need that, those reading services, they're going to be using the Hegarty program to get that additional foundation of the phonics and the phonemic awareness piece.

1010
02:28:56,222 --> 02:29:12,093
In addition to that, some of the other pieces that we're using for tier two instruction are Alexia Learning, reading A to Z. Houghton Mifflin has many components for tier two, the decoding power, as well as the write-in readers.

1011
02:29:12,893 --> 02:29:17,056
And those are utilized in the classroom, as well as smaller classrooms outside of this.

1012
02:29:17,697 --> 02:29:25,302
This is the second literacy block that I spoke about, which is our wind block, when tier two is occurring, as well as tier three.

1013
02:29:26,463 --> 02:29:28,084
Which I'm going to toss back to Katie.

1014
02:29:28,424 --> 02:29:28,605
Sure.

1015
02:29:29,305 --> 02:29:40,095
So, if you think back to the visual tier three is the smallest one, and that's the, the smallest group of students who's going to need this more is most intensive form of instruction and typically this is.

1016
02:29:41,381 --> 02:29:43,381
implemented by special education teachers.

1017
02:29:44,042 --> 02:29:53,804
And it can be in the form of individual goals or benchmarks and services based on students' individual needs, which have been determined following a comprehensive assessment.

1018
02:29:53,964 --> 02:30:07,606
And it could include phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, comprehension or written expression using a variety of, there isn't just one thing we use for all students.

1019
02:30:08,067 --> 02:30:09,567
It all depends on individual need.

1020
02:30:10,487 --> 02:30:19,437
And typically, this happens after a student has been determined eligible for special education and their team has decided that this is a service that they need.

1021
02:30:20,078 --> 02:30:24,763
And the time of the service is going to depend on the student's individual need as well.

1022
02:30:25,433 --> 02:30:28,634
It could take place in the classroom during whole group instruction.

1023
02:30:28,714 --> 02:30:36,037
It could take place in a pullout setting and a small group instruction or one-to-one, or it could take place in both places for a child.

1024
02:30:37,778 --> 02:30:42,800
But again, this is really very individualized and for the students who need the most support.

1025
02:30:49,542 --> 02:30:50,323
Is that last slide?

1026
02:30:51,363 --> 02:30:53,864
So as you can see, we've made a lot of,

1027
02:30:54,867 --> 02:31:01,253
solid steps with the science of reading and early literacy, but we certainly have more work to do.

1028
02:31:01,273 --> 02:31:10,642
And on the screen here are some examples of ongoing early literacy work that we are all dedicated to providing for our students.

1029
02:31:10,842 --> 02:31:18,469
So we will continue with professional development on the science of reading, including the newly established Massachusetts literacy resources.

1030
02:31:19,369 --> 02:31:25,271
We will continue to acclimate our K-2 staff on the newly adopted map growth early screener.

1031
02:31:25,651 --> 02:31:40,696
There's a lot there, as you can see from the reports, and we feel it is extremely important that we take the time to make sure that teachers, administrators, staff understand the data that we are looking at so that we can use it to the best of its ability.

1032
02:31:41,618 --> 02:31:50,123
We will continue to expand our data teams to make informed decisions about intervention and monitor progress using the MTSS framework.

1033
02:31:51,144 --> 02:31:54,986
We will continue with PD on the Massachusetts Dyslexia Guidelines.

1034
02:31:55,787 --> 02:32:00,110
We will continue professional development based on students' specific needs.

1035
02:32:01,310 --> 02:32:05,593
And we will be piloting and selecting, as you know, a new core reading program.

1036
02:32:06,614 --> 02:32:07,714
And we will also

1037
02:32:09,065 --> 02:32:19,307
Once we have ECRI Tier 1 and we feel that everybody is comfortable with that, we do have anticipated training for our Tier 2 ECRI as well.

1038
02:32:20,967 --> 02:32:21,547
And that's it.

1039
02:32:23,327 --> 02:32:24,368
So I just want to thank you.

1040
02:32:24,488 --> 02:32:26,708
And I just want to thank this wonderful team.

1041
02:32:27,588 --> 02:32:30,089
We meet frequently to have these thoughtful discussions.

1042
02:32:30,669 --> 02:32:32,649
And if you have any questions, please let us know.

1043
02:32:33,949 --> 02:32:35,530
Thank you very much for the presentation.

1044
02:32:35,570 --> 02:32:38,430
Member McLaughlin and Member Russo, the member of Vanderbilt

1045
02:32:40,700 --> 02:32:42,280
Thank you.

1046
02:32:42,300 --> 02:32:42,540
Thank you.

1047
02:32:42,560 --> 02:32:42,740
Thank you.

1048
02:32:42,760 --> 02:32:43,941
Thank you for the presentation.

1049
02:32:43,961 --> 02:32:45,421
It's very detailed.

1050
02:32:45,441 --> 02:32:48,682
I had a couple of questions.

1051
02:32:48,782 --> 02:32:56,203
For the PD on the Massachusetts dyslexia guidelines, I guess, what does that look like?

1052
02:32:56,243 --> 02:32:59,583
And is there any information on that offered to families?

1053
02:32:59,643 --> 02:33:08,765
I know that there have been concerns from families in the district around this issue, and I'm wondering how they're informed regarding this, or are they?

1054
02:33:10,350 --> 02:33:12,511
PD on the mass dyslexia guidelines.

1055
02:33:17,874 --> 02:33:20,335
Can you just, I'm not quite sure which slide you're referring to.

1056
02:33:20,355 --> 02:33:27,318
I'm talking about, Dr. Keyes was talking about offering PD on the mass dyslexia guidelines.

1057
02:33:27,979 --> 02:33:35,042
So I was just asking how parents are informed on what the dyslexia guidelines are, or are they, and in what instance if a child

1058
02:33:35,760 --> 02:33:38,501
is failing or seems to be failing, what is the process?

1059
02:33:38,561 --> 02:33:54,389
I know that we're not medical, the school does not offer medical diagnosis and dyslexia is not a medical diagnosis, but in what instance is there understanding of what those dyslexia guidelines are for our families or our students who are struggling?

1060
02:33:54,969 --> 02:33:55,289
Is there?

1061
02:33:55,870 --> 02:34:01,672
So with regard to professional development on the early literacy screener, which is often referred to as dyslexia screener,

1062
02:34:03,175 --> 02:34:09,440
A great, you can see on that slide 10, a few different offerings, which I think Member McLaughlin, you might've been originally referring to.

1063
02:34:10,600 --> 02:34:17,325
Some of these, the Dyslexia Foundation Conference were examples of PD that some of our staff attended.

1064
02:34:18,506 --> 02:34:20,888
The graduate credit course, I believe Ms.

1065
02:34:20,908 --> 02:34:25,531
Campbell actually also took that course along with several staff members as well.

1066
02:34:25,651 --> 02:34:30,855
So some staff members partook in some of these.

1067
02:34:31,328 --> 02:34:40,310
In terms of the early literacy screener and understanding that that is something that as we piloted the screeners, whether it was like see a rapid or.

1068
02:34:41,390 --> 02:34:51,553
map growth, these were conversations that we were constantly having because there was a big question of why are we taking the time to assess students, so a lot of that fell into different conversations.

1069
02:34:51,929 --> 02:34:55,010
In terms of communication with parents, I probably would have to defer to Ms.

1070
02:34:55,030 --> 02:35:00,311
Galussi on that, but hopefully that answers the question with training for the staff.

1071
02:35:00,471 --> 02:35:01,391
I think so, yeah.

1072
02:35:01,812 --> 02:35:18,716
And so just, yeah, I'm not, I don't know what the mass dyslexia guidelines are, and I'm just wondering if parents or families or caregivers who have children who are having reading difficulties are aware of those or are made aware of those so that they understand what the school's responsibility is and how to get support for their child if they need it.

1073
02:35:19,488 --> 02:35:27,951
Sure, I last week I sent out an update to elementary families just because this week starts the report card conference week.

1074
02:35:28,512 --> 02:35:34,934
And so part of the letter spoke about the report card conferences, but I also spoke about map growth because it's newly adopted.

1075
02:35:35,515 --> 02:35:42,457
I did provide some resources links in that communication to families so that they could see ahead of time.

1076
02:35:42,798 --> 02:35:48,140
Some of those links walk the parents through what the screener looks like and can answer some of the questions for them.

1077
02:35:48,900 --> 02:36:04,856
In terms of the bigger picture of how it relates to the mass dyslexia piece, I think that right now, one of the key pieces of communication I wanted to get to parents is that because we've fully adopted MAP,

1078
02:36:06,991 --> 02:36:11,014
The Mississauga was the only school that was using that as their pilot.

1079
02:36:11,594 --> 02:36:24,022
So for three fourths of our families, they're going to get these family reports to be quite honest, they'll see some baseline data, but there will be no growth, because this is the first time they're taking this screener.

1080
02:36:25,382 --> 02:36:26,163
from that growth.

1081
02:36:26,864 --> 02:36:36,894
Missituck families, if their children were in the school for kindergarten and first grade, they may see some growth if they were there because they were part of that pilot last year.

1082
02:36:37,354 --> 02:36:39,056
So we're kind of in flux right now.

1083
02:36:39,376 --> 02:36:45,542
As we get this data, as Dr. Keyes was talking about, as this data becomes

1084
02:36:46,563 --> 02:37:00,347
more at our fingertips where we can kind of start to see the pieces of the areas and where the students are growing versus their learning edges that we have to address, then I think that's when those thoughtful conversations will happen.

1085
02:37:00,847 --> 02:37:09,950
Part of what we're doing in school buildings is that when teachers are concerned and they're seeing that there is a lack of growth or there are areas that they need to work on with students,

1086
02:37:10,650 --> 02:37:18,295
we have in place our student support team and that's where we start because we wanna see those tier one interventions first.

1087
02:37:19,135 --> 02:37:35,304
So teachers will come and they'll work with administrators in the building as well as their colleagues to see what are some supports we can put in place tier one for these students, maybe tier two too within the classroom and track the growth, look at the progress monitoring.

1088
02:37:35,844 --> 02:37:38,326
And then if there are further concerns,

1089
02:37:40,707 --> 02:37:50,758
we just kind of like go up the level, but those conversations, the parents are informed that their child is being brought to a student support team discussion.

1090
02:37:51,239 --> 02:37:58,867
Okay, so there's not, I'll look at the master's dyslexia guidelines, but I'm assuming there's not a link or anything like that to them on the website or is there?

1091
02:37:59,400 --> 02:38:02,663
There is a link on the website and on our website.

1092
02:38:03,804 --> 02:38:16,815
I don't think that we have it on our school website at this point it is linked on the website and if you read the guidelines they're really designed for everyone they were written for educators for parents for for a wide audience.

1093
02:38:17,615 --> 02:38:30,927
And much of the work that we're doing is in full alignment with what you'll see in those guidelines because it really starts off by talking about the science of reading and what should be done at tier one.

1094
02:38:31,508 --> 02:38:37,754
It's not until I think like the sixth chapter of the guidelines that they even discuss special education.

1095
02:38:38,334 --> 02:38:44,318
Because what we're really talking about is what supports can we put into place that will benefit all readers?

1096
02:38:45,459 --> 02:38:54,205
Because if we're providing strong, systematic instruction in tier one, we will find that for most of our students, their needs will be met.

1097
02:38:54,625 --> 02:39:00,389
And then there might be some students, there will be some students who need additional supports, but that is kind of an extra layer.

1098
02:39:01,429 --> 02:39:07,934
And that's something that we've also looked at in special education to make sure that we're in alignment with all of those guidelines in that special education.

1099
02:39:08,414 --> 02:39:10,335
portion of the mass dyslexia guidelines.

1100
02:39:10,415 --> 02:39:10,935
Yeah, thank you.

1101
02:39:10,955 --> 02:39:12,956
That's what I wanted to follow up with the question for.

1102
02:39:13,136 --> 02:39:25,722
So for the tier three supports, when a student is identified as tier three in the monitoring system and a tier three support, is that then in the, are those services then in the IEP grid?

1103
02:39:26,302 --> 02:39:35,567
So typically if a student is receiving tier three supports, it's usually with an individualized educational program and those supports are outlined in their IEP.

1104
02:39:36,058 --> 02:39:42,721
And that would be only through an assessment, a reading assessment that they're identified as having a meeting a tier three support?

1105
02:39:43,301 --> 02:39:47,783
Yes, typically tier three supports are only for students who have been identified with a disability.

1106
02:39:47,923 --> 02:39:55,927
There are occasional situations where a student might require like a tier three level, but they're not eligible for special education.

1107
02:39:56,467 --> 02:40:03,010
But by and large, students who require that level of intervention are receiving tier one, tier two.

1108
02:40:03,090 --> 02:40:05,711
And then on top of that, they're also having special education instruction.

1109
02:40:05,922 --> 02:40:13,365
Right, and so then tier three would be through a reading assessment that they would- It would be through a special education assessment that would be a comprehensive reading assessment.

1110
02:40:13,405 --> 02:40:19,788
Okay, and then so they would have a specific reading goal on their IEP.

1111
02:40:19,848 --> 02:40:24,570
They would likely have more than one goal because it would be in the areas of difficulty.

1112
02:40:24,590 --> 02:40:26,891
So they might well have a decoding goal.

1113
02:40:26,971 --> 02:40:32,374
They might have a fluency goal, but it would be broken down by their individualized special areas of need.

1114
02:40:32,634 --> 02:40:33,574
Fascinating, thank you.

1115
02:40:33,854 --> 02:40:35,395
Can I just add one quick thing to that?

1116
02:40:35,728 --> 02:40:44,212
I think it's really important, and this question came up with the staff a couple of years ago, is something like MAP growth or Lexia Rapid, that is not a dyslexia screener.

1117
02:40:44,853 --> 02:40:55,418
If a child gets low achievement, it just means that at the top moment that we have a need for intervention, but it is not an automatic diagnosis by any means.

1118
02:40:55,478 --> 02:40:58,300
It's just to inform our instruction, one piece of the puzzle.

1119
02:40:58,340 --> 02:41:03,722
So I just want to make that clear, because I know that was confusing to the staff a few years ago, just simply in the label of the law.

1120
02:41:04,423 --> 02:41:04,743
So thank you.

1121
02:41:06,940 --> 02:41:07,280
Thank you.

1122
02:41:07,621 --> 02:41:09,103
Member Rousseau, then Member Van de Kloet?

1123
02:41:10,965 --> 02:41:11,385
I'm done.

1124
02:41:11,465 --> 02:41:12,006
I got my credit.

1125
02:41:12,266 --> 02:41:12,927
Member Van de Kloet?

1126
02:41:13,628 --> 02:41:14,569
Yes.

1127
02:41:14,649 --> 02:41:15,350
Just real quickly.

1128
02:41:15,991 --> 02:41:20,056
So are students being assessed for the family report four times a year?

1129
02:41:21,037 --> 02:41:21,197
Great.

1130
02:41:21,564 --> 02:41:22,365
Three times a year.

1131
02:41:22,585 --> 02:41:23,125
Three, yes.

1132
02:41:23,526 --> 02:41:24,647
And fall, winter, and spring.

1133
02:41:25,007 --> 02:41:39,679
Is the idea that it might, for those students who haven't achieved fluency, would it ultimately go up to maybe through the third grade or is it, you know, will it grow?

1134
02:41:41,781 --> 02:41:43,002
Yes, most definitely.

1135
02:41:43,062 --> 02:41:47,927
So NWEA, I think we heard about this at a previous meeting.

1136
02:41:49,502 --> 02:41:54,604
The map growth piece goes all the way, as Dr. Chiesa said, to grade 10.

1137
02:41:55,344 --> 02:42:00,746
So students are going to be continuously progress monitored and assessed for these skills.

1138
02:42:01,266 --> 02:42:06,887
The only difference is on NWEA map, there are two tests for the K-2 level.

1139
02:42:07,948 --> 02:42:14,670
The one we're using is the K-2 growth because it has the screener piece that checks that box from DESE that

1140
02:42:15,825 --> 02:42:20,387
that is the screener that meets the dyslexia guidelines rules.

1141
02:42:21,648 --> 02:42:29,332
The other test doesn't have the nitty gritty components that we presented to you on this evening, if that makes it clear.

1142
02:42:29,352 --> 02:42:38,677
But when students move on to third grade, those five elements of reading, they're going to have that continuously monitored through map growth.

1143
02:42:38,697 --> 02:42:39,857
Okay, thanks.

1144
02:42:39,977 --> 02:42:40,738
Am I missing anything?

1145
02:42:40,758 --> 02:42:41,378
No, no, that's perfect.

1146
02:42:41,998 --> 02:42:43,199
Sounds good, thank you.

1147
02:42:44,278 --> 02:42:45,698
Thank you very much for the presentation.

1148
02:42:45,938 --> 02:42:47,059
Thank you so much.

1149
02:42:48,699 --> 02:42:56,982
Number four, we have updated presentation on superintendent's goals, which we received in our packet tonight for school year 21, 22.

1150
02:42:57,622 --> 02:43:01,083
Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, if you'd like to say a few words and then I'll entertain a motion.

1151
02:43:02,140 --> 02:43:03,000
Good evening, everyone.

1152
02:43:03,300 --> 02:43:19,745
I am in these revised goals, everything that is highlighted in yellow was based on the feedback that you gave to me at the November 8 meeting and based on the questions and suggestions that were made from wordsmithing.

1153
02:43:20,565 --> 02:43:25,826
I highlighted in yellow, anything that was added and or changed.

1154
02:43:26,587 --> 02:43:27,027
And so,

1155
02:43:29,514 --> 02:43:42,443
Essentially, the key revisions were under the first two goals, and I am seeking the committee's approval on these revisions if it's amenable.

1156
02:43:43,104 --> 02:43:43,884
Motion to approve?

1157
02:43:44,525 --> 02:43:44,865
Second.

1158
02:43:48,267 --> 02:43:48,427
Aye.

1159
02:43:48,567 --> 02:43:52,610
Aye.

1160
02:43:54,412 --> 02:43:56,913
Goals have been approved for fiscal year, school year 21-22.

1161
02:43:56,933 --> 02:43:57,414
Sorry, my mic was off.

1162
02:44:02,227 --> 02:44:15,234
Number seven presentations of public not to begin before seven regular meetings of the school committee, including included this presentations of the public agenda item to give any resident, the opportunity to place a presentation for the school committee.

1163
02:44:15,754 --> 02:44:17,895
A resident may only present once at any meeting.

1164
02:44:17,955 --> 02:44:24,499
These presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee, but not opportunities for dialogue with the committee.

1165
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:32,505
If one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, a member may request that item to be added to a subsequent regular meeting.

1166
02:44:33,366 --> 02:44:40,070
The details for submitting a presentation will be found within the policy BEDH, public comment, and presentations of the public.

1167
02:44:40,911 --> 02:44:50,838
Pursuant to policy BEDH, public comment, and presentation of the public, any resident in the audience may be given permission to speak once on any item on the agenda for up to three minutes.

1168
02:44:51,258 --> 02:44:54,380
The speaker is expected to keep their comments to the item on the agenda.

1169
02:44:54,787 --> 02:45:00,489
The speaker must begin their comments by providing their full name and full Medford Street address where they reside.

1170
02:45:00,609 --> 02:45:13,892
Residents may also submit their comments by writing to the superintendent of schools prior to the meeting, or by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us prior to or during the item on the agenda.

1171
02:45:14,473 --> 02:45:22,935
Written comments must be kept to a length that allows for them to be read into the record in less than three minutes, or the comments will be summarized by the secretary of the school committee.

1172
02:45:23,703 --> 02:45:28,444
A welcoming, inclusive community is both a value of the school committee and an aspirational goal.

1173
02:45:29,044 --> 02:45:32,145
We ask for your help in achieving this goal and value your perspective.

1174
02:45:33,465 --> 02:45:36,586
When writing or emailing, please provide this required information.

1175
02:45:37,506 --> 02:45:45,108
Number one, the number and name of the item on the agenda, your first and last name, your full Medford Street address where you reside, your question or comment.

1176
02:45:45,888 --> 02:45:47,428
Number eight, continued business.

1177
02:45:47,448 --> 02:45:48,988
I don't believe we have any.

1178
02:45:49,529 --> 02:45:51,349
Number nine, new business.

1179
02:45:53,743 --> 02:45:55,084
offered by member Ms.

1180
02:45:55,104 --> 02:45:56,584
Stone and member Russo.

1181
02:45:58,165 --> 02:46:09,389
Whereas the health and safety of the children of Medford is of the utmost importance to the Medford school committee and is the well, as is the wellbeing of children throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1182
02:46:10,090 --> 02:46:20,594
Whereas many Massachusetts schools and childcare centers permit the use of toxic pesticides on outdoor grounds, including glyphosate and

1183
02:46:20,956 --> 02:46:34,639
to 4D potentially endangering children's health, whereas children absorb more pesticides relative to their body weight than adults and children's organ systems are still developing and are less able to detoxify harmful chemicals.

1184
02:46:35,499 --> 02:46:50,343
And in 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics called for governments to reduce children's exposure to pesticides, writing that scientific evidence demonstrates associations between early life exposure to pesticides and pediatric cancers

1185
02:46:50,987 --> 02:47:09,450
decreased cognitive function and behavioral problems, whereas a bill currently proposed at the Massachusetts State Legislature H.926, an act relative to improving pesticide protections for Massachusetts school children, would allow only pesticides considered minimum risk by the U.S.

1186
02:47:09,490 --> 02:47:17,572
Environmental Protection Agency and those permitted for organic use to be used near schools and childcare centers in Massachusetts

1187
02:47:20,327 --> 02:47:30,571
except in the case of the health emergency when school officials could apply for a waiver similar to laws passed by the state of New York in 2010, by the state of Connecticut in 2015.

1188
02:47:32,232 --> 02:47:44,837
Whereas this bill filed by representative Carmen Gentile is co-sponsored by the entire Medford delegation, representatives Paul Donato, Sean Garbally and Christine Barber, together with many other legislatures.

1189
02:47:45,637 --> 02:47:49,439
And whereas the bill is endorsed by a growing coalition of environmental,

1190
02:47:50,069 --> 02:48:15,355
health and community advocacy organizations, including the Center for Biological Diversity, Climate Action, now Western Massachusetts, the Conservation Law Foundation, Massachusetts Forest Watch, the Massachusetts Sierra Club, Mass PIRG, Mothers Out Front Massachusetts, the Northeast Organic Farming Association,

1191
02:48:15,970 --> 02:48:19,071
and the Sustainable Business Network of Massachusetts.

1192
02:48:19,211 --> 02:48:44,481
Now, therefore be it resolved that the School Committee of Medford, number one, support House Bill 926, an act relative to improving pesticide protections for Massachusetts school children, two, urges the Massachusetts House of Representatives to bring this bill to a vote, and three, sends a letter of support to the Honorable Speaker, Mr. Mariano,

1193
02:48:45,316 --> 02:48:49,079
The Honorable Mr. Donato, the Honorable Mr. Garbally, the Honorable Ms.

1194
02:48:49,179 --> 02:48:49,579
Barber.

1195
02:48:50,340 --> 02:48:51,160
Offered by Member Ms.

1196
02:48:51,180 --> 02:48:52,361
Stone and Member Rousseau.

1197
02:48:53,222 --> 02:48:55,524
Is there a motion on the floor or would either of you like to speak?

1198
02:48:56,825 --> 02:48:58,586
Motion for approval by Member Ms.

1199
02:48:58,606 --> 02:49:00,307
Stone, seconded by Member Rousseau.

1200
02:49:00,848 --> 02:49:01,688
All those in favor?

1201
02:49:01,708 --> 02:49:02,389
Aye.

1202
02:49:02,569 --> 02:49:03,370
All those opposed?

1203
02:49:04,130 --> 02:49:05,531
The paper passes.

1204
02:49:07,673 --> 02:49:08,173
Number two.

1205
02:49:08,313 --> 02:49:08,594
Mayor?

1206
02:49:09,034 --> 02:49:09,214
Yes.

1207
02:49:11,874 --> 02:49:23,663
Before I offer, before I motion to table this, I just want to, I've received a couple of communications about concerns about my items on the agenda in context to what's happened in the last week.

1208
02:49:24,223 --> 02:49:26,985
And I just think it's, and I'm going to actually

1209
02:49:27,426 --> 02:49:30,528
at a subsequent meeting make a suggestion change to our rules.

1210
02:49:30,588 --> 02:49:39,855
But I wanted to make it clear to the community that this item number two was actually emailed to the superintendent's office on November 10th for this meeting.

1211
02:49:40,416 --> 02:49:43,838
It was not in relation to what has gone on in the last week.

1212
02:49:44,859 --> 02:49:52,545
I try to plan my motions out far in advance and apparently I did not hit the jackpot with the timing on this particular one.

1213
02:49:53,025 --> 02:50:00,049
So for number two, I would like to make a motion to table this to the next meeting.

1214
02:50:01,429 --> 02:50:02,490
Table or send to committee?

1215
02:50:03,350 --> 02:50:05,692
Number two, I would just like to send to the next meeting.

1216
02:50:05,892 --> 02:50:07,172
Send it to the next meeting.

1217
02:50:07,893 --> 02:50:10,714
Motion to table by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1218
02:50:10,754 --> 02:50:11,235
Roll call.

1219
02:50:12,695 --> 02:50:13,276
Member Graham?

1220
02:50:13,356 --> 02:50:13,576
Yes.

1221
02:50:14,696 --> 02:50:15,157
Member Kretz?

1222
02:50:15,177 --> 02:50:15,257
Yes.

1223
02:50:15,897 --> 02:50:16,817
Member McLaughlin, yes.

1224
02:50:16,837 --> 02:50:17,558
Member McStone?

1225
02:50:17,698 --> 02:50:17,898
Yes.

1226
02:50:18,318 --> 02:50:19,019
Member Rousseau?

1227
02:50:19,039 --> 02:50:19,259
Yes.

1228
02:50:19,699 --> 02:50:20,499
Member Van de Kloot?

1229
02:50:20,559 --> 02:50:20,699
Yes.

1230
02:50:22,421 --> 02:50:22,741
Yes.

1231
02:50:25,764 --> 02:50:27,266
7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

1232
02:50:27,386 --> 02:50:28,927
This motion is tabled.

1233
02:50:30,129 --> 02:50:30,849
Just tabled.

1234
02:50:30,889 --> 02:50:32,831
Do you want a specific meeting?

1235
02:50:32,851 --> 02:50:33,952
Because the 20th.

1236
02:50:34,973 --> 02:50:36,755
Yeah, the 20th is quite a rather interesting.

1237
02:50:36,775 --> 02:50:38,096
Would you like it in a January meeting?

1238
02:50:38,116 --> 02:50:39,478
Let's do the first meeting in January.

1239
02:50:40,238 --> 02:50:40,919
January 3rd.

1240
02:50:40,939 --> 02:50:41,540
January 3rd.

1241
02:50:41,600 --> 02:50:42,120
Sounds great.

1242
02:50:42,140 --> 02:50:42,361
Thank you.

1243
02:50:42,381 --> 02:50:42,681
Thank you.

1244
02:50:43,615 --> 02:51:04,640
Number three, the rules policy and equity subcommittee will review the implementation of the October 2020 policy on the use of out-of-school suspensions in light of recent out-of-school suspensions that appear to fail to meet the spirit or 10 of the policy passed unanimously by the Memphis School Committee and will make recommendations if necessary to clarify the language of the policy offered by member Russo.

1245
02:51:06,135 --> 02:51:06,615
Thank you, Mayor.

1246
02:51:07,236 --> 02:51:13,121
This also was submitted on November 16th, not related to the last week.

1247
02:51:13,501 --> 02:51:15,683
Again, two strikes and I'm out, I guess.

1248
02:51:16,544 --> 02:51:21,008
But I would like to just motion to send this to subcommittee.

1249
02:51:21,528 --> 02:51:24,090
Motion to send this to subcommittee, seconded by?

1250
02:51:24,931 --> 02:51:25,271
Second.

1251
02:51:25,391 --> 02:51:26,693
Second by Member McLaughlin.

1252
02:51:26,713 --> 02:51:27,493
All those in favor?

1253
02:51:27,994 --> 02:51:28,334
Aye.

1254
02:51:28,634 --> 02:51:29,415
All those opposed?

1255
02:51:30,376 --> 02:51:31,637
Motion is sent to subcommittee.

1256
02:51:35,615 --> 02:51:43,380
Number four, the superintendent will schedule a tour for the Medford School Committee of all boys and girls locker rooms at Medford High School in the month of January.

1257
02:51:44,321 --> 02:51:53,827
Furthermore, a complete listing of spending on boys and girls sports from all sources will be provided at the first meeting of the school committee in February.

1258
02:51:53,927 --> 02:51:58,610
Member McStone and Member Russo, is there a motion on the floor?

1259
02:51:59,650 --> 02:52:00,391
Motion to approve.

1260
02:52:00,571 --> 02:52:03,853
Motion to approve by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

1261
02:52:06,278 --> 02:52:07,019
All those in favor?

1262
02:52:07,039 --> 02:52:07,639
Aye.

1263
02:52:07,819 --> 02:52:08,519
All those opposed?

1264
02:52:09,160 --> 02:52:10,000
Motion is approved.

1265
02:52:12,081 --> 02:52:12,661
Number five.

1266
02:52:14,342 --> 02:52:19,465
Whereas the school committee is committed to achieving the mission statements of Metro Public Schools.

1267
02:52:20,085 --> 02:52:34,493
The Metro Public Schools is a caring educational partnership of school, family, and community designed to ensure that all students are afforded a safe and healthy learning environment in which they develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to reach their full academic and personal potential

1268
02:52:35,882 --> 02:52:54,110
And whereas the effects of the pandemic have exacerbated challenges in school climate and current culture nationwide and here in Medford, therefore be it resolved that the Medford Public Schools will issue an RFP to perform a climate and culture assessment of Medford High School to be completed before the end of this academic year.

1269
02:52:54,871 --> 02:53:04,175
The RFP will seek a qualified and independent vendor to conduct a survey of staff, students, and families who are part of the high school community.

1270
02:53:05,369 --> 02:53:21,435
Be it also resolved that the project scope will include recommendations to address moving forward in a manner that prioritizes a healthy school community and contends with the district's past handling of incidences that are race, gender and bullying based.

1271
02:53:22,335 --> 02:53:32,459
It also resolved that recommendations will outline organizational, structural, professional development and curriculum based changes needed to address the findings and achieve our district wide mission

1272
02:53:33,783 --> 02:53:49,211
be it further resolved that the school committee authorizes an expenditure of up to $50,000 to complete this important initiative and that the superintendent will return to the school committee to seek authorization for additional funds should the qualified bids received at the bid opening be in excess of this authorization.

1273
02:53:49,631 --> 02:53:51,692
Submitted by Member Graham and Member Rousseau.

1274
02:53:51,712 --> 02:53:53,353
Is there a motion on the floor?

1275
02:53:53,653 --> 02:53:54,273
Motion to approve.

1276
02:53:54,413 --> 02:53:55,414
I have a question actually.

1277
02:53:55,494 --> 02:53:56,595
Member McLaughlin.

1278
02:53:56,995 --> 02:53:57,295
Thank you.

1279
02:53:59,086 --> 02:54:05,436
I am wondering about, first of all, I guess I wanted to ask the superintendent, her thoughts on this.

1280
02:54:05,656 --> 02:54:07,619
And then I had one other follow up question.

1281
02:54:07,699 --> 02:54:13,068
So if I may, superintendent, what are your thoughts on climate and

1282
02:54:14,895 --> 02:54:16,376
culture assessment for the high school.

1283
02:54:17,116 --> 02:54:36,903
So again, out of some of the comments that I made earlier, we're definitely going to be making a concerted effort to be working closely at the high school level, addressing climate and culture concerns, providing those opportunities to hear more voices, student voice, staff voice.

1284
02:54:37,543 --> 02:54:43,325
And so we're going to be making some noted changes in that area in documenting

1285
02:54:44,525 --> 02:54:52,888
That information so we can make informed decisions and that we can help to shift the culture and climate concerns that exist at the high school level.

1286
02:54:54,848 --> 02:54:58,109
I did have a question on this resolution.

1287
02:55:01,211 --> 02:55:16,539
the third paragraph up from the bottom, where it talks about the project scope and asking us to focus on a healthy school community and contends with the past handling of incidents.

1288
02:55:16,639 --> 02:55:22,923
And so I just was going to ask for some clarification to kind of

1289
02:55:24,645 --> 02:55:27,426
let me know what the thinking was in that area.

1290
02:55:27,906 --> 02:55:28,186
Sure.

1291
02:55:28,746 --> 02:55:29,326
Member Graham.

1292
02:55:29,646 --> 02:55:32,207
Yeah, I can answer that question.

1293
02:55:32,267 --> 02:55:47,031
So, you know, as we have been navigating through all of what's been going on in the last week, I've had parents reach out to me and say things like, this is exactly what it felt like when I was a student before the race riots.

1294
02:55:48,251 --> 02:55:51,472
And I've had parents reach out and say,

1295
02:55:53,433 --> 02:55:58,297
what has changed since the gun magazine incident.

1296
02:55:59,618 --> 02:56:12,108
And it strikes me that, you know, one of the reasons why I think we need this outside party to be involved in this conversation is because the things that require fixing here are very systemic.

1297
02:56:12,348 --> 02:56:21,135
And what ends up happening is we see something happen and the sort of problem bubbles to the surface.

1298
02:56:23,393 --> 02:56:31,157
take care of it for the moment, but we've never fundamentally changed the system underneath it that's fundamentally broken that needs to be fixed.

1299
02:56:31,278 --> 02:56:47,187
And I am really interested in taking a very systemically oriented approach here to solving this problem and really setting us with the help of experts on the right path

1300
02:56:48,147 --> 02:57:13,021
um that I see that as complementary to what you outlined earlier tonight and I'm not saying that our like our past handling has to do with with anybody in particular you at all anybody in particular it's just that as an as a community we've we've not done this well in terms of fixing systems that contribute

1301
02:57:13,661 --> 02:57:14,841
to climate and culture.

1302
02:57:15,301 --> 02:57:26,764
And so my interest in all of this is to say, if we are going to fix systemically what is wrong, we really don't have that expertise in-house.

1303
02:57:27,764 --> 02:57:36,986
And frankly, it's work beyond the scope of what we could reasonably expect our current staff to do, given all that else that they have to do in their regular day job.

1304
02:57:37,486 --> 02:57:47,492
So when I say past handling, there are parallels to what we've seen in the last week, to what we have seen before at various points in time.

1305
02:57:48,052 --> 02:57:51,775
And that doesn't get better without a lot of hard work and systemic change.

1306
02:57:51,855 --> 02:57:56,097
So that is what I meant by the past handling comment, if that helps.

1307
02:57:56,417 --> 02:57:57,758
Thank you for the clarification.

1308
02:57:58,859 --> 02:57:59,059
Mayor?

1309
02:57:59,079 --> 02:57:59,179
Mayor?

1310
02:57:59,199 --> 02:57:59,379
Oh, sorry.

1311
02:58:00,360 --> 02:58:03,462
Let member McLaughlin finish and then member Rousseau, member Van de Kloop.

1312
02:58:04,202 --> 02:58:04,622
Thank you.

1313
02:58:06,405 --> 02:58:09,935
And I appreciate the response from my colleague and the superintendent and.

1314
02:58:11,468 --> 02:58:33,717
To that end, someone did follow up with me as well that said, and I don't know that this is accurate, I'm sure colleagues here know better than I do, that something similar was, or I don't know if it was similar in terms of cost or proposal, but something similar was created as a result of the McGlynn incident a few years ago, but that it actually was ignored.

1315
02:58:33,877 --> 02:58:38,418
Or maybe there was a transition in staff and people were unaware of it or what have you.

1316
02:58:38,438 --> 02:58:39,659
So I think to that end,

1317
02:58:40,259 --> 02:58:41,560
First of all, I guess, is that true?

1318
02:58:42,040 --> 02:58:58,071
And secondly, to that end, the second to the last paragraph, I think, is really important that we're talking about what the recommendations are and that they're outlining very specific ways to create systemic and structural change and thinking about the implementation of that.

1319
02:58:58,131 --> 02:59:02,514
Because if this has happened in the past and these reviews have been done, but then

1320
02:59:04,468 --> 02:59:08,171
have sat and nothing has happened, obviously we don't want that to happen again either.

1321
02:59:08,811 --> 02:59:18,417
So I guess the question is, has this been done in the past and what has happened as a result of those RFPs or reports on climate and culture assessments of schools?

1322
02:59:18,957 --> 02:59:20,858
And how can we make this time different?

1323
02:59:22,179 --> 02:59:24,100
Member Rousseau, I think wants to answer that.

1324
02:59:24,420 --> 02:59:24,741
Thank you.

1325
02:59:24,761 --> 02:59:26,702
Yes, I have the actual report in front of me.

1326
02:59:27,550 --> 02:59:34,255
It was only for the McGlynn Middle, although there was a little bit of the McGlynn Elementary included because of the fact that it's one building.

1327
02:59:34,355 --> 02:59:46,104
And, you know, the report was done by the Center for Trauma Care and School Alliance of Inclusion and Prevention Incorporated, possibly the longest name for a company I think existing.

1328
02:59:47,285 --> 02:59:48,986
That's one long name.

1329
02:59:49,607 --> 02:59:53,950
And I remember when we got the report, and I,

1330
02:59:57,721 --> 03:00:02,285
The biggest takeaway was that things were dandy, which was surprising.

1331
03:00:03,926 --> 03:00:08,850
And maybe it was just that things were pretty good, considering what everybody thought.

1332
03:00:09,650 --> 03:00:15,555
And I think that might have been really what was happening is that everybody thought the McGlynn medal was, you know,

1333
03:00:16,277 --> 03:00:17,778
You know, culturally a disaster.

1334
03:00:18,198 --> 03:00:30,788
They came in and they they surveyed students, the Yale population, I don't have the full list in front of me, and the staff MTA, and things were much better than I think people had imagined.

1335
03:00:31,741 --> 03:00:39,468
the gun clip incident was months before when they finally were in doing their work.

1336
03:00:39,588 --> 03:00:41,590
So of course, things can improve.

1337
03:00:42,450 --> 03:00:45,293
So we did have one, but it was not for the high school.

1338
03:00:45,974 --> 03:00:51,839
And I can't remember, was it last year or the year before?

1339
03:00:52,438 --> 03:01:10,640
That was one of my budget priorities that I have is that we would be doing these on a rolling basis through all of the school communities, you know, like one every other year, but because I think it is hard to keep the pulse as staff and students and families and principals and everybody's changing.

1340
03:01:11,261 --> 03:01:15,822
And the state and the federal government is telling us to change all these things all the time.

1341
03:01:15,842 --> 03:01:21,624
And it's school committee members, certainly we can't keep a pulse on this ourselves.

1342
03:01:23,004 --> 03:01:31,726
But I think in the short term, the focus for me and why I'm also a co-signer on this is that it seems that the high school is definitely where it needs to happen.

1343
03:01:31,746 --> 03:01:34,907
And I just wanna also comment on the amount.

1344
03:01:35,789 --> 03:01:38,611
Excuse me, just as a point of information, would you send that to us?

1345
03:01:38,751 --> 03:01:38,971
Sure.

1346
03:01:39,171 --> 03:01:39,551
Thank you.

1347
03:01:39,591 --> 03:01:41,893
And also on the amount, what was it for that report?

1348
03:01:42,053 --> 03:01:47,256
So the amount is completely a mystery because it was paid for by the mayor at the time.

1349
03:01:47,896 --> 03:01:49,797
So we were not even consulted.

1350
03:01:49,877 --> 03:01:50,418
The mayor just

1351
03:01:51,522 --> 03:01:59,131
I presume picked up the phone or the superintendent picked up the phone and made the call so we'd I have no idea what it costs.

1352
03:01:59,832 --> 03:02:09,223
And so, therefore, there was no basis for the number in here, but we had to put something in here, so this number may well be wildly more than is needed.

1353
03:02:11,231 --> 03:02:17,573
I emailed the company that did the last one, and they really could not give me a number without consultation.

1354
03:02:17,613 --> 03:02:21,655
And I said, well, it's not me they should be consulting, it's the superintendent.

1355
03:02:22,635 --> 03:02:27,397
So we just picked the number that hopefully will be the right number or big enough, so.

1356
03:02:27,557 --> 03:02:30,099
Second.

1357
03:02:30,899 --> 03:02:34,340
Member McLaughlin, if you wanna finish, then Member Van de Kloot, Member Graham.

1358
03:02:35,581 --> 03:02:35,981
Oh, sorry.

1359
03:02:37,455 --> 03:02:37,955
You can finish.

1360
03:02:38,095 --> 03:02:39,435
Member McLaughlin, do you have another question?

1361
03:02:39,695 --> 03:02:41,196
Oh, no, I'm sorry, I'm done.

1362
03:02:41,696 --> 03:02:42,016
Thank you.

1363
03:02:42,316 --> 03:02:42,796
Okay, thank you.

1364
03:02:42,956 --> 03:02:45,036
Member Van de Kloet, then Member Graham.

1365
03:02:45,517 --> 03:02:48,017
Yes, just because I think it's appropriate to ask.

1366
03:02:48,957 --> 03:02:51,938
So let's take the $50,000 figure.

1367
03:02:52,778 --> 03:03:04,260
Given our expenditures to date, is it realistic to that we will be able to cover that expense given our budget expenses so far this year?

1368
03:03:06,431 --> 03:03:08,973
And I guess I'm asking Mr. Murphy that.

1369
03:03:11,856 --> 03:03:28,892
It definitely wasn't a planned expenditure, but given the clarification from Member Rousseau that this number was given because of the absence of another number, that I'm thinking we could potentially be able to

1370
03:03:29,676 --> 03:03:36,961
have some kind of an assessment done for a significantly less expensive amount.

1371
03:03:38,823 --> 03:03:50,031
That's what my initial thinking was when he provided the clarification that it was to, because for that amount, I would probably be thinking more of an entire district.

1372
03:03:50,812 --> 03:03:58,858
And so since we're talking specifically about the high school, it's one building, I think it would be significantly less

1373
03:04:02,616 --> 03:04:12,182
I don't have the information, and I can try to find out the cost of the other vendor that worked with the middle school.

1374
03:04:12,462 --> 03:04:12,642
Right.

1375
03:04:13,002 --> 03:04:22,508
So I guess my question is, are our expenses running as expected, or are they widely more than we expected?

1376
03:04:22,528 --> 03:04:26,550
And should we be concerned about spending a significant amount of money?

1377
03:04:26,890 --> 03:04:29,411
Now, again, part of the problem is it may not be significant.

1378
03:04:29,452 --> 03:04:29,792
Maybe it's $10,000.

1379
03:04:29,832 --> 03:04:30,332
Maybe it's $12,000.

1380
03:04:32,544 --> 03:04:46,832
I thank you for your question is better but I think we should always be concerned about spending significant amount of money regardless of our financial position but I would say 2 things at the moment year to date coming up on the halfway mark of the fiscal year.

1381
03:04:46,852 --> 03:04:50,994
I would say that we're in a relatively strong financial position.

1382
03:04:51,795 --> 03:05:01,220
As the committee knows we have several collective bargaining agreements that have not yet been negotiated and so that's something that we have to take into account with respect to all matters of the financial implication.

1383
03:05:02,057 --> 03:05:19,722
And finally, my read of the motion, and I think it's been referenced several times throughout the conversation this evening, that there's a, at a minimum, a significant correlation between the impact on students of the pandemic

1384
03:05:20,402 --> 03:05:23,244
and the climate and culture issues that we're facing.

1385
03:05:23,324 --> 03:05:32,468
And as the committee knows, we have a series of COVID related funding sources that could potentially be tapped in order to support this type of initiative.

1386
03:05:32,508 --> 03:05:36,370
And so based on all of that, and particularly that last point with respect to the available

1387
03:05:37,043 --> 03:05:38,064
COVID-related funding.

1388
03:05:38,905 --> 03:05:50,676
I would feel comfortable saying that once a determination is made with respect to the scope of the project, I would be surprised if we would have a financial challenge, but obviously we're going to determine the scope.

1389
03:05:51,037 --> 03:05:53,019
We're going to find a vendor at that point.

1390
03:05:53,119 --> 03:05:55,421
If there's a financial obstacle, we would report back to the committee.

1391
03:05:55,881 --> 03:05:56,062
Great.

1392
03:05:56,222 --> 03:05:57,863
That's exactly what I was hoping you'd say.

1393
03:05:59,420 --> 03:06:01,081
And second member Graham.

1394
03:06:01,722 --> 03:06:09,348
Yeah, I just wanted to clarify that we can get a survey for for a tiny bit of money.

1395
03:06:10,049 --> 03:06:23,060
But what I am looking for from a scope perspective is more than just somebody to come in and administer a survey and give us the aggregated data and the work that it will take for them to digest that data

1396
03:06:23,800 --> 03:06:29,502
and talk to us, because I think they won't be able to give us quality recommendations without talking to us.

1397
03:06:30,962 --> 03:06:42,765
And to give us recommendations that are actionable is why I felt strongly that we needed to have the room for the scope to play out the way that we're talking about.

1398
03:06:42,845 --> 03:06:48,207
Because if we are going to make systemic change, it's hard.

1399
03:06:48,607 --> 03:06:50,447
There's a reason we haven't done it already.

1400
03:06:54,877 --> 03:06:58,338
it is more complicated than anybody wants it to be.

1401
03:06:58,498 --> 03:07:16,825
So I think we really need to impress upon the bidders of the scope that we aren't just looking for a survey, but we're looking for a deep dive of sorts so that we have an action plan that we can execute on when they're done.

1402
03:07:18,346 --> 03:07:19,366
Thank you, member Graham.

1403
03:07:19,586 --> 03:07:20,147
Member Rossell.

1404
03:07:20,367 --> 03:07:20,707
Thank you.

1405
03:07:21,327 --> 03:07:23,008
And to kind of build off of that,

1406
03:07:24,212 --> 03:07:27,173
You know, when I remember Graham and I were talking about this.

1407
03:07:28,774 --> 03:07:37,337
You know, I think everybody in this room can probably come up with some examples of things we think should get done that would have effects on the culture and the climate.

1408
03:07:38,878 --> 03:07:45,461
But what seems most important is that somebody who will create this list.

1409
03:07:46,161 --> 03:07:51,766
will tell us the order to do them, because we can't do them all at once, even in the best of cases and best of years.

1410
03:07:52,307 --> 03:08:01,075
So I don't want us doing feel-good projects around climate and culture that have no real effect, because we've missed the elephants in the room.

1411
03:08:01,915 --> 03:08:07,801
And I expect some of those elephants in the room to be uncomfortable.

1412
03:08:08,441 --> 03:08:10,763
If they're not uncomfortable, then just send out a Google

1413
03:08:11,727 --> 03:08:14,128
survey and call it a day because that's a waste of money.

1414
03:08:14,828 --> 03:08:28,072
This, this should be telling us things like is our health curriculum, missing the mark on relationships and you know like there should be some pretty big things that are identified.

1415
03:08:31,284 --> 03:08:43,869
I don't know what they would be actually, but so it's really important that not just that it's a big list, maybe it isn't a huge list, but it's the order that it needs to happen is really important, I think, so.

1416
03:08:45,870 --> 03:08:46,230
Thank you.

1417
03:08:46,330 --> 03:08:57,554
And then I would just ask if there are free quotes, if we could just request a quote for our middle school that hasn't been done so we can plan ahead and prepare.

1418
03:08:58,955 --> 03:09:02,438
Is there a motion on the floor and maybe somebody could offer that amendment?

1419
03:09:03,478 --> 03:09:07,401
Second, member Stone motioned to approve and I seconded.

1420
03:09:08,342 --> 03:09:12,285
Motion by member Stone, seconded by member McLaughlin.

1421
03:09:12,385 --> 03:09:13,246
But what was the amendment?

1422
03:09:13,306 --> 03:09:13,746
I'm sorry.

1423
03:09:14,006 --> 03:09:20,731
It's a free process to get a quote that we get a quote for our other middle school that hasn't been done so that we can plan ahead.

1424
03:09:21,187 --> 03:09:22,048
Sure, why not?

1425
03:09:22,268 --> 03:09:22,468
Yes.

1426
03:09:23,189 --> 03:09:25,070
Motion for approval by members, Ms.

1427
03:09:25,090 --> 03:09:25,750
Stone, as amended.

1428
03:09:25,770 --> 03:09:28,693
Actually, Mayor, can we just say middle school?

1429
03:09:29,013 --> 03:09:36,699
Because I think a lot has changed in a very substantive way at middle school since that report has done.

1430
03:09:37,079 --> 03:09:38,920
We have a lottery process now.

1431
03:09:39,340 --> 03:09:41,562
We have two new building leaders.

1432
03:09:42,923 --> 03:09:47,827
We are trying to integrate those schools in a way that no one ever did before.

1433
03:09:47,927 --> 03:09:48,787
So I do think

1434
03:09:50,198 --> 03:09:58,825
If we just say middle school, that gives us the flexibility to acknowledge that we have two, and a lot of things have changed since that last report.

1435
03:09:59,865 --> 03:10:01,767
Okay, motion for approval as amended.

1436
03:10:01,887 --> 03:10:03,108
All those in favor?

1437
03:10:03,528 --> 03:10:03,628
Aye.

1438
03:10:03,748 --> 03:10:04,089
Aye.

1439
03:10:04,209 --> 03:10:05,069
All those opposed?

1440
03:10:06,610 --> 03:10:08,152
It should be for the money allocation.

1441
03:10:08,452 --> 03:10:08,652
Yes.

1442
03:10:08,872 --> 03:10:09,092
Okay.

1443
03:10:09,132 --> 03:10:09,433
Yes.

1444
03:10:09,513 --> 03:10:10,213
Remember Ms.

1445
03:10:10,233 --> 03:10:14,496
Stone made the motion, seconded by Member McLaughlin as amended by Member Graham.

1446
03:10:15,157 --> 03:10:16,618
But do we do- Roll call, please.

1447
03:10:16,738 --> 03:10:16,938
Yeah.

1448
03:10:17,058 --> 03:10:17,619
Member Graham?

1449
03:10:17,799 --> 03:10:17,999
Yes.

1450
03:10:20,382 --> 03:10:21,303
Member McLaughlin, yes.

1451
03:10:21,363 --> 03:10:22,164
Member McStone, yes.

1452
03:10:22,864 --> 03:10:23,845
Member Rousseau, yes.

1453
03:10:24,146 --> 03:10:24,967
Member Van de Kloet, yes.

1454
03:10:25,627 --> 03:10:27,930
Mayor Long-O'Karn, yes.

1455
03:10:28,150 --> 03:10:29,451
The motion passes.

1456
03:10:31,393 --> 03:10:32,895
Number 10 reports requested.

1457
03:10:32,935 --> 03:10:34,016
I don't believe we have any.

1458
03:10:34,076 --> 03:10:36,919
Number 11, we do have a condolence.

1459
03:10:37,279 --> 03:10:42,505
The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Beverly Ann Convery.

1460
03:10:43,328 --> 03:10:49,334
wife of late Thomas E. Convery, a history and civics teacher and head of job placement at Medford High School.

1461
03:10:49,875 --> 03:10:51,597
If we all may rise for a moment of silence.

1462
03:11:06,192 --> 03:11:06,973
Motion to adjourn.

1463
03:11:07,273 --> 03:11:12,859
Yep, our next meeting is Monday, December 20th, 2021, 6.30 p.m.

1464
03:11:13,240 --> 03:11:15,062
It will be here in Alden Memorial Chambers.

1465
03:11:15,102 --> 03:11:17,204
There also is a Zoom link.

1466
03:11:17,985 --> 03:11:23,411
Motion for adjournment by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

1467
03:11:23,591 --> 03:11:24,452
All those in favor?

1468
03:11:24,472 --> 03:11:25,773
All those opposed?
