00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:33,264
Hello everyone, and welcome to Method Happenings, a show for and about the city of Method.

2
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:35,886
I am your host, John Petrella.

3
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:45,613
The purpose of our program is to give Method citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

4
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:52,118
And today we have a very special guest by the name of Rick Orlando,

5
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:59,580
Rick will be speaking to us on things you need to know about building a new high school.

6
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:04,023
So I want to welcome you, Rick, to the show.

7
00:01:04,184 --> 00:01:04,664
Hello, John.

8
00:01:04,904 --> 00:01:06,185
Thank you for coming on.

9
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:16,872
I just want to start out by letting everyone know Rick does have a lot of experience when it comes to building schools.

10
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:28,776
Back in the late 90s, he was on a great team that gave us all the newest schools that we have in this city.

11
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:32,937
So I'm going to let Rick explain everything to you.

12
00:01:33,737 --> 00:01:45,060
And, you know, I guess my first question, Rick, to you is, you know, how did the elementary and middle schools get done back in the late 90s?

13
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:53,185
Well, back then, the Bedford schools at that time, there were 13 elementary schools and I believe three middle schools.

14
00:01:54,325 --> 00:01:55,346
They were decades old.

15
00:01:55,386 --> 00:01:57,386
I think one was actually 100 years old.

16
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:03,228
They were very inconsistent, both in the size, the amenities, and features they had in the schools.

17
00:02:04,288 --> 00:02:06,829
And they were very much in various stages of disrepair.

18
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:20,599
The city had spent considerable amounts of money dealing with the structural components of the school, but at the end of the day, there was very little improvement to the actual educational quality and value in the schools.

19
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:32,468
There were a lot of key issues that were extremely difficult to deal with because of, again, the various sizes of the schools, and some had certain rooms, others didn't.

20
00:02:34,149 --> 00:02:43,031
The educational staff did amazing work in these old buildings, but the facilities were really the problem that hampered them in trying to do any of that.

21
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:54,074
Equality of dealing and delivering education was what I think the city realized they could not deal with and deliver with these old buildings.

22
00:02:55,355 --> 00:03:02,800
So I'm going to follow up and just ask you this, you know, what was the team, what was it like, the team makeup?

23
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,182
I mean, who actually, I know you played a big part, but what were the roles?

24
00:03:07,502 --> 00:03:20,991
Well, at that time, the administration, once they realized they didn't want to keep throwing money, more money after bad with the old buildings, the mayor and the superintendent created a citywide team to evaluate the current state.

25
00:03:21,571 --> 00:03:26,392
become educated on what might be some of the solutions, both at the local and state level.

26
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:30,673
And the committee had members from each of the schools.

27
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:32,013
We had elected officials.

28
00:03:32,073 --> 00:03:33,553
We had school administrators.

29
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:38,234
We had a variety of, I think, 13 plus people.

30
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:45,676
I had the benefit and opportunity of working with those people who were, some of them I have as very good friends to this day.

31
00:03:46,656 --> 00:03:49,977
They were made up, we had architects, school teachers,

32
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:56,942
We had a grant manager from one of the major universities, Tricia McDonough was my co-chair.

33
00:03:58,383 --> 00:04:02,906
And there was just an awful lot of expertise within the makeup of that team.

34
00:04:03,426 --> 00:04:09,791
And again, I thank the superintendent and the mayor at that time for having the vision to put that together.

35
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,173
And that outreach went on for about a year.

36
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,535
And that would have been Mayor McGlynn?

37
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:15,515
Yes, Mayor McGlynn.

38
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,696
And Superintendent Roy Belson?

39
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:16,936
Yes.

40
00:04:18,177 --> 00:04:20,939
All right, listen, we know it was successful.

41
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,183
It was very successful, actually, everything that you guys did.

42
00:04:27,303 --> 00:04:31,586
But, you know, what was the approach that you took to get to where you got to?

43
00:04:31,846 --> 00:04:38,151
Well, I think it was important, as I just described, some of the expertise the people had, and that benefited the committee, no doubt.

44
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:45,074
But what was more important was the attitude and commitment of those people on the committee.

45
00:04:45,755 --> 00:04:47,336
They avoided individual agendas.

46
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:53,779
They focused on what was best for the city and for the students and children in our school system.

47
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:55,020
They worked hard.

48
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,542
They met, I was thinking back, I think we met almost every week.

49
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:05,726
Sometimes multiple meetings, sometimes things on Saturday where we needed to do some special research.

50
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:08,368
They took assignments.

51
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,469
They stepped up.

52
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:12,972
I never remember having a plea with any of them.

53
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:16,915
If we had a task to do, just threw it out and the hands went up and we got things done.

54
00:05:18,957 --> 00:05:20,238
They understood the process.

55
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:27,163
They understood that, in fact, they were not the wherewithal of what this project would be about.

56
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:33,228
They had to work with the Mass School Building Authority at the state level to understand what our options were.

57
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:41,757
They worked with the city and school administration, and we had various service firms, architects, construction management people that they had to work with.

58
00:05:41,837 --> 00:05:44,280
So they were just one of a much larger team.

59
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:50,387
There's some other things which I could touch upon.

60
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:54,731
A big part of it was outreach, and both not only

61
00:05:56,098 --> 00:06:06,322
Knowing what you would know and what the skills you didn't know and how you could learn from others, we spent time going around to many, many other communities that had gone through this in the past.

62
00:06:07,082 --> 00:06:10,703
And those people were very willing to tell you, do this, don't do that.

63
00:06:11,463 --> 00:06:13,224
And it took

64
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:22,264
a lot of time, but people gladly got together on a Saturday and spent the whole day to go out to two or three communities within a single day.

65
00:06:23,344 --> 00:06:40,515
In addition to learning what the educators and people in those various communities did, we also had, at that time, Jack Buckley, who was the program manager for the city, not to be confused with the current police chief, but Jack Buckley, who's a long-term life member of the community.

66
00:06:41,115 --> 00:06:43,177
He was the city's program manager, and Jack

67
00:06:44,057 --> 00:06:51,721
went out and did some research with other communities and people who ran programs of this type in other cities.

68
00:06:52,481 --> 00:07:03,026
I had a strong business and friendship with another gentleman out in the Hanson area, and he spent time with Jack, and Jack took, again, took the time to learn about how to go about this.

69
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:05,667
Communities don't do this every year.

70
00:07:06,287 --> 00:07:11,910
It's new ground, and the more you can learn from other people that have gone down the path, the better off you are.

71
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:15,629
Great answer.

72
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:23,295
Hey, you know, we know a lot of the process has to do with the MSBA.

73
00:07:24,116 --> 00:07:29,461
And so people know that's the mass building, mass school building authority.

74
00:07:29,521 --> 00:07:29,761
Yes.

75
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:33,184
So it's quite a process.

76
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:40,350
So can you describe or fill us in on some of the processes that take place?

77
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,010
I mean,

78
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:45,672
You know, we're going to have to do something with Meffitt High School.

79
00:07:46,192 --> 00:07:50,953
I don't think there's anyone in the city that's saying we don't need something to be done.

80
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,474
But, you know, what's the process, the MSBA?

81
00:07:54,554 --> 00:07:55,654
How's it work now?

82
00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:57,275
What's the situation?

83
00:07:57,395 --> 00:08:01,236
Well, the process steps are very similar to back when we did it.

84
00:08:03,454 --> 00:08:13,940
The cities go through what they call a period in which they can submit the fact that they want to pursue some type of program on a particular school or schools.

85
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:17,522
It goes through the eligibility period.

86
00:08:17,783 --> 00:08:19,163
And Medford went through that, I believe.

87
00:08:20,504 --> 00:08:36,463
about a year or so ago, but more recently they were invited to what they call the feat to conduct a feasibility study, which really is the meat and content of what the city needs to do and what they submit to the state for evaluation.

88
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:42,206
It includes the educational programming, what the enrollments are.

89
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:44,187
I believe it still does.

90
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:48,609
We had to do a 10-year student projection.

91
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,310
There's maintenance, capital planning.

92
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,732
You get into the whole design study period for what you want.

93
00:08:55,812 --> 00:09:00,114
Then you begin to select who your owner project manager is going to be.

94
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:03,496
Then there's a whole process by which you go through your bids

95
00:09:05,497 --> 00:09:12,741
various architectural firms, and then you determine funding and get into the details of the design.

96
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,282
A lot of work.

97
00:09:14,882 --> 00:09:23,207
It can take quite an amount of time to do that and a lot of research, but I think what

98
00:09:24,862 --> 00:09:30,248
is important is that the team needs to understand that that process doesn't happen overnight.

99
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:41,960
You work with all those various people that I mentioned before, getting as much information as you can from the state, and then looking at what your condition is, and that's what you're going to provide as part of this feasibility study.

100
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,601
you investigate the current state of this high school.

101
00:09:46,321 --> 00:10:05,827
Interestingly enough, when I was looking through the material we did years ago, we actually did a study the following year about the high school in terms of the needs, and they are considerable, and I suspect, although there have been some improvements made, such as the science lab, the gymnasium, the pool, and so on, I suspect there's a lot of other things that still need to be done.

102
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:10,609
Oh, yeah, I'm sure of that, yeah, without a doubt.

103
00:10:12,347 --> 00:10:27,448
You know, can you describe, I guess the question in my mind, can you describe key elements of what the city, I guess, what the city needs to submit to the MSBA?

104
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:34,536
Well, there's probably the single most important thing is the educational plan.

105
00:10:35,377 --> 00:10:36,678
And you might say, well, what is that?

106
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:37,378
It's a school.

107
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:38,940
We provide education.

108
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,861
We have curriculum, classes, and so on.

109
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:52,929
But what the head administrator of the school system, in this case it was Roy Belson, as the superintendent at that time, with some other people he worked with, it describes

110
00:10:54,265 --> 00:11:01,350
what the approach, what the configuration's going to be in the school, and the kinds of programs.

111
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:10,396
So let's say, hypothetically, I know they've been talking about integrating the high school with the vocational school.

112
00:11:10,777 --> 00:11:16,941
I don't know if that decision's been made, but if such a plan was going to go about, that would be part of the educational plan.

113
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:22,425
And what this does, this describes and creates the scope for the project.

114
00:11:23,045 --> 00:11:25,106
People think, well, it's a building, we need bricks, mortar.

115
00:11:25,126 --> 00:11:28,947
No, first you need to describe what you're going to do in that building.

116
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:35,069
That defines the spaces, the features, the amenities, things of that nature.

117
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:40,151
Again, so it's the educational plan becomes the specification.

118
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:46,293
And it's crucial that that is done describing what you want to be embodied in this building we're sitting in right now.

119
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:53,376
Does that include, you know, I'm just going to throw this out there.

120
00:11:53,576 --> 00:11:55,837
Would that include like some kind of maintenance plan?

121
00:11:55,857 --> 00:11:57,897
Would that be part of it also?

122
00:11:58,037 --> 00:11:58,997
That's another component.

123
00:11:59,037 --> 00:12:09,980
The maintenance plan is something the city also has to has to provide to the state because the state wants to know the dollars they're going to invest in your community are protected so that the building doesn't fall into disrepair again.

124
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,081
So that the maintenance capital plan that needs to be an essential element.

125
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,322
Now, when we did

126
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:32,136
the project years ago, there was a third portion, which was the racial balance plan, which I'll talk about a little bit later, which is not the case for this particular project, the high school, that plan would not, such a plan would not be required.

127
00:12:32,637 --> 00:12:33,037
Okay.

128
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:39,764
All right, so, so far now, we've submitted

129
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:45,134
I guess we submitted all the key elements to the MSBA.

130
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:46,535
We're on board.

131
00:12:46,595 --> 00:12:47,596
They're on board.

132
00:12:48,197 --> 00:12:49,718
So now what happens?

133
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:50,619
What's next?

134
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,940
You submit everything.

135
00:12:52,861 --> 00:12:53,561
What comes next?

136
00:12:55,048 --> 00:12:58,171
Like anything like that, there's a lot of detail in that plan.

137
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:02,174
A lot of work would have had to have been done by the city and the school administration.

138
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:11,341
And it's likely the building authority will many times come back with questions, you know, could you give us a little clarity on this?

139
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:12,882
We need an additional bit of information.

140
00:13:12,902 --> 00:13:15,784
So you could have a back and forth on that for a while.

141
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:22,209
But then assuming it goes forward and they've got everything they need, and let's say they approve it,

142
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,572
Medford will be added to the list.

143
00:13:24,612 --> 00:13:39,005
I think there are 23 other communities that have been approved with the MSBA for various renovation building projects and things of that nature and we would be next in line after that 23rd on the list.

144
00:13:40,747 --> 00:13:41,668
So actually

145
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:45,398
We're 24.

146
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:46,138
We would be 24.

147
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:52,184
Assuming we get in on time, we assume we meet all the requirements, we get approved, yes, we would be 24.

148
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:57,910
And I suspect there are other communities that are also in parallel doing the same things we're doing right now.

149
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:58,170
Right.

150
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:58,630
So it's 24, 25.

151
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,011
Yes, yes.

152
00:13:59,031 --> 00:13:59,992
So we're the 24th school.

153
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:00,092
24th.

154
00:14:04,374 --> 00:14:09,458
in line, so to speak.

155
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:10,819
It's just the nature of the work.

156
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:22,127
There are many communities and towns and cities in the commonwealth that are all having the same challenges Medford's having with older buildings and things that need to be done.

157
00:14:23,388 --> 00:14:23,769
Okay.

158
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,912
So, you know, what you did in the past

159
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:32,972
I mean, it was just, it was truly amazing.

160
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:37,013
In my opinion, you know, most people, I mean, everything went smooth.

161
00:14:37,053 --> 00:14:38,993
The community was aware of everything.

162
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:42,034
You know, there was some give and take back and forth.

163
00:14:42,254 --> 00:14:42,454
Yeah.

164
00:14:42,554 --> 00:14:49,595
Can I just touch upon, as you say that, maybe, maybe think about something that, um, there were a lot of people involved.

165
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:52,356
A lot of people, not only with commitment, but had

166
00:14:53,122 --> 00:14:59,930
a range of different skills and they always had the insight and understanding of what they needed to reach out and get additional information for.

167
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:07,440
And the feasibility study and all the work that had to be submitted was conducted by people within

168
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:13,784
the city, and school administration, and all of the volunteer experts.

169
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:19,769
That was all done, put together, and submitted to the state.

170
00:15:20,609 --> 00:15:28,614
The thing I find surprising, there may be reasons for it, but as I understand it now, the city is requesting, I think it's over a million dollars, to do that work.

171
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:33,476
And we didn't have to have that situation in the past.

172
00:15:33,876 --> 00:15:34,816
Why, I don't know.

173
00:15:35,197 --> 00:15:40,098
But that's one of the differences, as I recall.

174
00:15:40,118 --> 00:15:45,899
And that was, you know, I mentioned that because that's leading into my next question.

175
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:52,281
And, you know, we're talking the late 90s, you know, 2025.

176
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:58,843
So, you know, I guess, what are the differences from what you guys did in the past

177
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,580
to what's going on now.

178
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,365
And I know that's a big one because a million dollars is a million dollars.

179
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:06,106
Yes.

180
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:10,232
And you guys flat out had nothing but volunteers.

181
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:12,955
Well, let's just be clear.

182
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:14,277
It wasn't only the volunteers.

183
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:22,203
It was also the school administration that had some, you know, obviously we've mentioned the superintendent.

184
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,564
He had a great team around him.

185
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:29,106
Gail Zeman was the financial director, I believe, at the time.

186
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:32,308
And there were different people, the staff.

187
00:16:33,088 --> 00:16:39,272
And those people, you know, he drew upon them for what he needed to describe and create that educational plan.

188
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:53,455
I would say that in terms of the process, the steps we talked about, eligibility, feasibility, the education, a lot of those steps are very similar today as they were years ago.

189
00:16:54,216 --> 00:16:58,817
The big difference from the past project is the funding.

190
00:16:59,657 --> 00:17:01,678
Today's funding formulas are very different.

191
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,081
In the past, we had what they call Category 1, 2, and 3.

192
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:11,104
And for our purposes, the key fund category was Category 1.

193
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:14,126
It was the racial balance plan, which is no longer available.

194
00:17:15,026 --> 00:17:23,593
And that requirement, if met, which we met, provided the city 90% funding for the entire project.

195
00:17:24,014 --> 00:17:28,357
And that project at that time was, I think, about $110 million.

196
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:35,443
So if you do the math, 90% of those costs to the city were provided by the state, not the federal government.

197
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:36,324
I still hear that today.

198
00:17:37,045 --> 00:17:38,786
No, it was not the federal government.

199
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:39,387
It was the state.

200
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:44,973
And the remaining 10% was actually made up by selling some of the older buildings.

201
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:55,604
So for all, if you look at the entire project, it was paid pretty much by either the funding from the state or the sale of the old buildings.

202
00:17:55,845 --> 00:17:57,286
And it was very successful.

203
00:17:58,646 --> 00:18:12,303
Another thing that, just going back to the racial balance plan, what that required was a certain area of expertise that we needed to draw in other skills.

204
00:18:12,944 --> 00:18:17,429
And we drew on this gentleman called, known as Michael Elves, he was from Brown University.

205
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:28,974
And he was an expert on this, and not only was he an expert in terms of what the racial balance plan needed, it also added credibility to our submission to the state.

206
00:18:29,894 --> 00:18:35,256
And one of the people I know that worked, Grace Lauderney, worked an awful lot with Michael Alves.

207
00:18:35,276 --> 00:18:39,737
She was one of the volunteers, as well as working with the superintendent and the other people.

208
00:18:40,178 --> 00:18:44,759
And they created the racial balance plan, which was part of the submission, which secured the 90% for us.

209
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:45,139
That was key.

210
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:57,678
Okay, so the MSAB fund, you know, I guess... Today versus yesterday?

211
00:18:57,758 --> 00:19:02,040
Yeah, I mean, how much... Well... I mean, the state doesn't want to get audited.

212
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,161
I mean, for that matter, nobody wants to get audited anymore.

213
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:07,162
But, you know, how much money?

214
00:19:07,302 --> 00:19:08,622
I mean, where does the money come from?

215
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:09,883
How much goes into the fund?

216
00:19:11,655 --> 00:19:14,897
Let me just say, just touch upon one difference.

217
00:19:15,297 --> 00:19:27,765
What I just described was what we had the good fortune to take benefit of, 90% funding, which really took the educate, I'm sorry, the financial challenge off the city, off the taxpayers back then.

218
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:33,948
Today, most funding, the funding for all communities starts at 31%.

219
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:37,211
31 percent.

220
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:49,141
So you begin at that position, and then there are small incremental percentages you can add depending upon if you as a city, you meet the criteria, you know, whether it's

221
00:19:51,702 --> 00:19:58,366
the way you manage the project, the way it's built, the environmental stats, things of that nature.

222
00:19:58,627 --> 00:20:03,850
There are a variety, and it might get you an additional eight, nine, 10, 15%.

223
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,553
Most communities struggle and strive to get somewhere between 40 and 50%.

224
00:20:07,593 --> 00:20:07,773
Again, not 90%.

225
00:20:11,715 --> 00:20:18,198
And that's just the reality of what the state has in terms of availability of money.

226
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:28,363
If you want to think about it in real terms, if you look at other surrounding communities, Winchester did a renovation a few years ago.

227
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:31,525
I think it was in the range of about $110 million.

228
00:20:33,105 --> 00:20:35,226
And they didn't get 50%.

229
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:37,988
They got somewhere probably in the 40s.

230
00:20:39,408 --> 00:20:40,448
I think

231
00:20:55,273 --> 00:20:58,634
$65 million tax burden to the city.

232
00:21:00,715 --> 00:21:09,537
If you look at a new school like what Arlington did, they probably saw about $150 million as tax obligation to the citizens.

233
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:21,580
So these are very serious numbers, but it's just the nature of the funding that's available, and a city does the best it can to try to maximize the percentages.

234
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:44,080
They're very different numbers in dollars than what they were in the past so even if method You know does the best they can I Mean being 24th on the list I mean, but who knows I mean anything can happen so even at the best You look at it.

235
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:45,601
Maybe 50% That's the best

236
00:21:48,162 --> 00:21:49,123
You're probably not.

237
00:21:49,263 --> 00:21:50,984
You're probably in the ballpark, yeah.

238
00:21:51,224 --> 00:21:51,544
Okay.

239
00:21:51,624 --> 00:21:51,784
Yeah.

240
00:21:51,924 --> 00:21:52,404
All right.

241
00:21:52,424 --> 00:21:53,565
So it's 50% or below.

242
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,785
We can go with that number?

243
00:21:55,265 --> 00:21:55,706
Yeah.

244
00:21:55,726 --> 00:21:57,626
That's probably not a stretch.

245
00:21:57,927 --> 00:21:58,287
Okay.

246
00:21:59,007 --> 00:21:59,307
All right.

247
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:00,868
So the application

248
00:22:02,503 --> 00:22:05,284
gets this far, gets to that point now, okay?

249
00:22:06,385 --> 00:22:12,587
So what does the city need to, you know, consider?

250
00:22:13,328 --> 00:22:14,888
What do they need to put in place?

251
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,849
I mean, there's got to be a bid.

252
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,950
I assume bid in construction is next.

253
00:22:20,811 --> 00:22:22,992
So the city has a lot of work to do with that.

254
00:22:24,873 --> 00:22:36,481
Well, one of the important things we found out by doing that outreach to other communities was that we got a very strong recommendation to bring in a construction management firm.

255
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:42,125
Now, at that time, it wasn't a requirement by the building authority at the state level, but we

256
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:45,687
got good input that that's very useful to do that.

257
00:22:46,427 --> 00:23:05,140
And where that plays out is one of the first things, one of the early things you do when you start putting this whole project together is to get the, you select an architect, you work out the details of what you want designed and what the scope of the work is, and they come up with an estimate of how much this work, this project is going to cost.

258
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:11,184
Now, that ultimately becomes the number that the state will look at and say, oh, we're going to give you X percentage funding for that.

259
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:19,275
But what a construction management firm will do is provide another set of eyes on that number before you submit to the state to validate it.

260
00:23:19,295 --> 00:23:23,502
It's not suggesting the architectural firm doesn't know what it's doing.

261
00:23:24,163 --> 00:23:27,047
But again, a second set of eyes is always very valuable.

262
00:23:27,848 --> 00:23:30,929
And we found that very useful when we did the project years ago.

263
00:23:30,949 --> 00:23:38,951
You know, there were some differences on what the architect had, the construction management firm, and they worked through, oh, what the differences were, and so on.

264
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:49,054
And it got us to a much clearer understanding of what the number to build, at that time, the four elementary schools and the two middle schools.

265
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:54,275
So, and it's crucial to, again, get out of the gate with the correct number.

266
00:23:55,095 --> 00:24:04,318
The second part that the construction management firm provided was actually working with the team, the city team, and the architects during the construction period.

267
00:24:05,158 --> 00:24:07,099
You need to manage the project.

268
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:15,902
It's essential that you manage the project, the schedule, the timing, the events, the deliverables, all that on time and with the right cost.

269
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:17,442
All right.

270
00:24:17,802 --> 00:24:20,803
You know, so my next question would be,

271
00:24:25,303 --> 00:24:32,890
Okay, so you got, we're talking about the funding, you know, the bidding construction and everything, so what would be the city's role?

272
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,353
And then, you know, I have to ask this, what's the taxpayer's role?

273
00:24:38,514 --> 00:24:41,837
What happens between the city, the taxpayer, where do we go?

274
00:24:43,038 --> 00:25:01,184
You know, in the case of what I believe is going to happen with the high school, assuming they get through some of the steps we've already talked about and they determine what the financial obligation is going to be of the city, there would probably have to be an override to make up that portion of the cost.

275
00:25:02,785 --> 00:25:07,109
paid by the taxpayers, there would have to be an override vote, and I think that's actually a requirement.

276
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:13,775
If you don't secure the override, the state, you know, puts on the brakes and says, how are you going to do this?

277
00:25:13,795 --> 00:25:15,677
How are you going to fund the project?

278
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:21,582
So the city, let's assume they get the override passed.

279
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:23,523
and it can move forward.

280
00:25:23,543 --> 00:25:33,085
What the city has to do is, this is a formality that the building assistance requires that the city approves the entire project budget total.

281
00:25:34,185 --> 00:25:42,147
And then what will happen in over a 20-year period, the state reimburses you on an annual basis that portion.

282
00:25:42,587 --> 00:25:47,708
So you get the funding, but you don't get it in one lump sum.

283
00:25:48,428 --> 00:25:54,676
Every year, the bond payment comes up, the city pays its portion, the state contributes its portion.

284
00:25:54,856 --> 00:25:55,236
Okay.

285
00:25:56,298 --> 00:26:01,824
And then, you know, they'll have to decide how long of a bond, I mean, how many years, I mean, there's a lot of things.

286
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,066
Yeah, I think when...

287
00:26:04,447 --> 00:26:07,469
When it was done, I think when we had it in the past, it was 20 years.

288
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:12,533
But a little, an interesting bit of information on the past project.

289
00:26:12,993 --> 00:26:19,898
We had anticipated and going for the 20 years, getting our portion, 90% from the state, every year.

290
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:26,763
The state came in, I think it was in 2000, I've got a newspaper article on it.

291
00:26:28,245 --> 00:26:29,265
Came in in 2002, I think it was three.

292
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:35,968
and decided rather than do it over 20 years, they were going to pay it off all at once.

293
00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:37,789
They came in.

294
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:40,410
I remember being at the Roberts School.

295
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,031
The head of the MSBA was there.

296
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:46,952
The head of the Department of Division of Revenue was there.

297
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,433
A lot of the other folks from the city were there.

298
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:51,034
The mayor, superintendent, etc.

299
00:26:51,074 --> 00:26:51,934
was at the Roberts School.

300
00:26:52,554 --> 00:27:00,256
And they basically went through the formality of giving a check for the entire amount rather than extend it over 20 years.

301
00:27:00,596 --> 00:27:02,356
That was an abnormality.

302
00:27:02,376 --> 00:27:03,297
That was not a typical.

303
00:27:03,597 --> 00:27:04,357
But that's what happened.

304
00:27:04,417 --> 00:27:06,237
It's an awesome abnormality, by the way.

305
00:27:06,277 --> 00:27:07,678
I mean, that's very awesome.

306
00:27:07,698 --> 00:27:14,239
So in other words, the city was paid 100% everything at that point in time.

307
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:14,679
OK.

308
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:17,560
Just an interesting aside of how it played out in Bedford.

309
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,160
Very nice.

310
00:27:24,082 --> 00:27:33,247
You know, you look at a project this big, I've read it, other cities, other towns, and I don't know how this works.

311
00:27:33,427 --> 00:27:34,648
That's why I'm going to ask you.

312
00:27:34,668 --> 00:27:36,729
I'm going to maybe put you out on a limb here.

313
00:27:39,847 --> 00:27:42,568
So-and-so is going to put up the school.

314
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:44,329
It's $300 million.

315
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:47,891
The next thing you know, they hit something.

316
00:27:47,951 --> 00:27:49,231
This happened, that happened.

317
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:54,334
It now costs, I don't know, $350 or $400 million, whatever it is.

318
00:27:54,354 --> 00:27:56,755
I mean, they call them cost overruns.

319
00:27:57,455 --> 00:28:02,938
How do you try and prevent them, what happens if they

320
00:28:04,847 --> 00:28:08,728
If you get cost overruns, is MSBA still going to help out?

321
00:28:08,768 --> 00:28:10,789
I mean, that's a whole ball of wax there.

322
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:13,690
Well, that's a great question.

323
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:21,853
So, and this is one of the things, when you have a team like we had, you know, the city had, you have a construction management firm.

324
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:25,354
Ted Gentry, he was a strong resource.

325
00:28:25,674 --> 00:28:34,357
You had Jack Buckley, which we call the bulldog, and you had Ron Lamar from the HMFH, the architectural firm, who was our liaison.

326
00:28:35,197 --> 00:28:41,903
They were relentless in tracking down, watching the construction progress to ensure two things didn't happen.

327
00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:47,867
Unnecessary change orders and work stoppages.

328
00:28:48,348 --> 00:28:52,150
Either of those two things would cost the city incremental money.

329
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:59,576
And if they were work stoppages due to the city not being timely with their responses to progress, things that were needed,

330
00:29:00,977 --> 00:29:24,730
or if the change order wasn't a legitimate from the state's point of view those would be paid by the city and that brings up a very you know if there was such an unexpected thing that happened you know something in the ground ledge whatever it was that wasn't anticipated i think you could have a conversation with the state and they might say okay that's uh

331
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:29,873
was unexpected, and we will negotiate, you know, some kind of compensation for that.

332
00:29:30,474 --> 00:29:42,342
But it's crucial to know that things that run over budget, that can't be authorized by the state, 100% of that overrun is borne by the city.

333
00:29:43,063 --> 00:29:48,127
So you're not going to, you know, just keep spending money and get more and more from the state.

334
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:51,850
If it's not legitimate, if it can't be approved by the state,

335
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,832
The city will bear the cost of that overrun 100%.

336
00:29:57,313 --> 00:29:59,034
On top of the money they were already paying.

337
00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:00,414
So the city's on the hook.

338
00:30:00,995 --> 00:30:03,656
Again, if it's not a legitimate, unexpected change.

339
00:30:03,716 --> 00:30:05,197
Right, yeah.

340
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:06,137
Well, I can see that.

341
00:30:06,858 --> 00:30:10,180
And that's why it's valuable to have a strong team.

342
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:23,299
And I want to, as we're talking about this, I'm thinking, some towns, you know, they go the route of having a clerk of the works to pay the bills, to the contract.

343
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,003
You may have something like that, but you really need

344
00:30:26,664 --> 00:30:42,170
a professional, grounded, knowledgeable, city-paid project manager that represents and controls the program cost, controls the program schedule, and does a whole range of things that the list is lengthy.

345
00:30:43,211 --> 00:30:43,531
Okay.

346
00:30:43,831 --> 00:30:44,491
I'm sure it is.

347
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:54,475
You know, the other thing, you know, I'm going to go back for a minute because I just want to make sure I'm clear.

348
00:30:55,476 --> 00:31:00,341
I don't know what we spent, a million dollars for a consultant or whatever it was.

349
00:31:00,841 --> 00:31:06,026
So, and I understand, you know, it's expensive and you got to do things today.

350
00:31:07,327 --> 00:31:12,892
You know, a lot of things you got to do, hire a consultant or professionals and understood.

351
00:31:15,936 --> 00:31:22,338
So what exactly are you putting a million dollars up for at the beginning of the process?

352
00:31:22,378 --> 00:31:33,801
So yeah, I, you know, I, I honestly, to be fair, I can't detail what the, it may be for, you know, what the feasibility study has many elements, right.

353
00:31:33,981 --> 00:31:37,662
It may be, um, you know, obviously we talked about the, the education plan.

354
00:31:37,682 --> 00:31:39,063
We talked about the maintenance plan.

355
00:31:39,103 --> 00:31:41,223
We talked about capital plan.

356
00:31:41,523 --> 00:31:44,024
Um, it probably has,

357
00:31:45,953 --> 00:32:03,608
to do with work in those areas, that a consultant would work with, you know, bringing the standard template, work with the city administration, the superintendent, and various other people in the city to derive and pull that information together, and then literally just create it and get the document in on time.

358
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:07,151
I want to make it perfectly clear that I'm sure it's legitimate.

359
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:08,472
I'm not saying we don't need to do that.

360
00:32:08,492 --> 00:32:10,134
I'm sure it's for good cause, reasonable.

361
00:32:22,286 --> 00:32:25,607
You know, I just know things are so much more expensive today.

362
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:32,091
And, you know, sometimes you do, you have to spend the money to get things done right today.

363
00:32:33,232 --> 00:32:39,235
So I just want to make sure that I'm not saying that it's, you know, we shouldn't have spent a million or whatever.

364
00:32:39,455 --> 00:32:41,036
I'm sure it was well spent.

365
00:32:41,616 --> 00:32:42,896
Something that needed to be done.

366
00:32:42,936 --> 00:32:46,797
A city needs to look internally what skill sets it has with its people.

367
00:32:47,057 --> 00:32:47,278
Right.

368
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:48,858
The things that it's familiar with.

369
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:52,779
Again, this is not the kind of project that every city, a city's do every few years.

370
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:53,259
Right.

371
00:32:53,699 --> 00:33:00,261
And they may have just made the determination that it was best from a timing point of view to get into the state, that this was the best route to take.

372
00:33:00,601 --> 00:33:04,622
And I'm, you know, I'm going to go ahead and say I'm sure they got a good,

373
00:33:06,282 --> 00:33:10,906
a good committee or whatever you want to call them working on this that know their stuff.

374
00:33:10,946 --> 00:33:13,308
So I would think they do.

375
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:17,332
And that gets me to the next question.

376
00:33:17,352 --> 00:33:20,955
And this is the stuff.

377
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:28,770
that I always think about, I always look for, because I have to be honest.

378
00:33:30,253 --> 00:33:35,621
I know we do need to do something with the school, and it's going to be a tough decision.

379
00:33:38,734 --> 00:33:45,196
A new school, are you gonna, you know, use part of the building that's up there now?

380
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,717
I mean, there's a lot of options.

381
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:48,817
Where would you move the school to?

382
00:33:48,877 --> 00:33:52,199
What, you know, if there's enough property or land, whatever it is.

383
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:54,840
But I always,

384
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,741
You know most of my life.

385
00:33:58,021 --> 00:34:13,068
I like to look into things and and You know I always call it community engagement Okay And I guess my next question is what about community engagement I?

386
00:34:13,995 --> 00:34:23,839
Well, that's, you know, I was going back over, you know, I've got a book to my left that you can't see that it's about, I don't know.

387
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:24,399
It's thick.

388
00:34:24,499 --> 00:34:24,959
It's thick.

389
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:36,764
And a lot of it had to do with, and this is one of the things I think the committee, particularly the committee can take pride in, was the community engagement.

390
00:34:37,724 --> 00:34:40,045
You'll hear many times the word communication.

391
00:34:41,365 --> 00:34:42,146
Communication,

392
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:49,661
is a form of it, but what it really does, you need to reach out to the community.

393
00:34:49,681 --> 00:34:58,247
That doesn't mean putting out periodically a blast over an email or a blast over a city website.

394
00:34:58,407 --> 00:35:02,010
The only way you get really engagement is to really go out to

395
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,651
You know, go out to the schools.

396
00:35:03,671 --> 00:35:06,375
At that time, going back, there were multiple schools.

397
00:35:06,415 --> 00:35:06,615
We had 13.

398
00:35:07,216 --> 00:35:08,597
We had to go out to each of those districts.

399
00:35:09,298 --> 00:35:12,702
We had periodic meetings with the city council, with the school committee.

400
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:15,125
There were various communications.

401
00:35:15,726 --> 00:35:17,208
The city put out

402
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,542
newspapers which they put out every so often to communicate about the project.

403
00:35:27,823 --> 00:35:38,027
We had communications in printed form that we sent out to the schools that were distributed to allow the kids to take them home to their parents to let them know what was going on.

404
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:43,689
As the project was going, we had meetings that were televised.

405
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,991
Jack Buckley, you may recall seeing some of them during the construction period.

406
00:35:48,051 --> 00:35:48,591
I remember.

407
00:35:50,972 --> 00:35:59,474
The sessions were taped and were basically to keep the community up to speed with what was going on.

408
00:35:59,514 --> 00:36:04,155
What was going on, which would ultimately be the investment in schools and their community.

409
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:09,676
And so communication is, it really, it can't be passive.

410
00:36:10,176 --> 00:36:12,157
It has to be active.

411
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:17,178
You need to do it in a manner that the people feel like they know

412
00:36:18,198 --> 00:36:19,398
oh, there's going to be change.

413
00:36:19,938 --> 00:36:30,400
In the case of the school project in the past, the biggest change was going from 13 neighborhood elementary schools to four.

414
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:37,542
That was a big change for people, because they had grown, even though the buildings were, they knew the buildings were in difficult shape, but that was a big change.

415
00:36:37,942 --> 00:36:44,483
You know, I could go to my neighborhood school and walk in my neighborhood, and so,

416
00:36:45,212 --> 00:36:53,380
We had to do a lot of things to convey what would make that feel less impactful in a negative way to you.

417
00:36:53,721 --> 00:37:01,608
And we spent a lot of time meeting with people, talking with them, and actually incorporating some of the things that they were asking about in the design of the buildings.

418
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:10,191
where the entrances were, where the drop-off points were, where the cafeterias were, where the kids could come directly in and meet with staff.

419
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:17,813
So it was a lot to consider, but it was essential to ease people through that degree of change.

420
00:37:17,913 --> 00:37:18,174
Right.

421
00:37:19,074 --> 00:37:24,115
I can honestly say, I had two young ones going through.

422
00:37:24,135 --> 00:37:25,576
They were at the Gleason at the time.

423
00:37:26,396 --> 00:37:29,677
And you guys really,

424
00:37:31,037 --> 00:37:45,889
It still took some work, but if you had children in school back then, I mean, I can remember going downstairs in the Gleason and, you know, the asbestos that used to be wrapped around the, I can remember going down there, you know, it's falling on my head.

425
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:56,517
So when it first came out that, you know, all these news, I mean, we were losing schools, but the way you guys had communicated, the way you explained it,

426
00:37:57,996 --> 00:38:02,121
along with the asbestos falling on, you know, coming down and everything else.

427
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:09,050
I mean, it was a phenomenal, I think it was just a great job community getting everyone involved.

428
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,853
And there were people that disagreed.

429
00:38:12,494 --> 00:38:16,018
They wanted to, you know, fix those schools and keep those little, yeah.

430
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:26,565
I'll make a clear point, we didn't decide whether it was going to be new buildings, which it ended up being, versus renovation.

431
00:38:27,946 --> 00:38:39,412
We basically put all the facts out on the table, where the funds would be, how much money would be available, and although renovation could have been an option, and not all schools were eligible for renovation dollars.

432
00:38:39,852 --> 00:38:43,534
because some of them were so bad the state came in and said, no, we can't invest anything in this.

433
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:46,996
But we put all that information out and we went into the community meetings.

434
00:38:47,677 --> 00:38:52,660
I remember doing a large presentation to the community at the high school auditorium.

435
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:57,803
It was in December of 97 and put it all out in front of people.

436
00:38:57,843 --> 00:38:59,124
We said, which way do you want to go?

437
00:38:59,244 --> 00:39:05,588
And then collectively over a period of time following that, the decision, they came back, we did surveys.

438
00:39:05,888 --> 00:39:08,310
They wanted to come back with, let's go with a new approach.

439
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,831
Was everybody in agreement on that?

440
00:39:11,091 --> 00:39:11,311
No.

441
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:16,855
But it seemed to be everybody said, the majority of the people said that was the best decision.

442
00:39:17,615 --> 00:39:21,398
And then we had to deal with where and so on.

443
00:39:21,418 --> 00:39:27,462
I think we evaluated over 40 sites when we did that and we came up with the sites which

444
00:39:28,102 --> 00:39:39,297
had to, interestingly enough, it goes back to the education plan based on the configuration of the schools dictated how you distributed those schools you were going to build, what size lots you needed.

445
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,660
So a lot of it tied together.

446
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,004
Yeah, no, it was interesting because I remember the

447
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:50,851
What is it, I'm sorry, the McGlynn, the Andrews were so close together.

448
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:53,134
Yeah, that was the part of the racial balance play.

449
00:39:53,234 --> 00:40:08,429
You had two middle schools at the Hormel site, as well as one elementary school, the McGlynn Elementary, and then you had the Roberts, the Misatuck, and the Hobbs are the three additional elementary schools.

450
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:10,211
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

451
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:24,702
Well, I got to tell you, okay, you know, I'm looking around, I'm trying to find information, you know, you go online, you look up City Hall site and, you know, recently I was able to get some information.

452
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,645
But, you know, I can't thank you enough.

453
00:40:28,305 --> 00:40:36,011
I mean, this is going to be money-wise, project-wise, construction, this is something, you know, it's big.

454
00:40:38,053 --> 00:40:40,015
And, you know, I think

455
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:45,163
we informed people today, which is what we wanted to do.

456
00:40:46,024 --> 00:40:49,506
I think everyone in the city agrees that, yeah, we got to do something.

457
00:40:49,526 --> 00:40:52,789
Our kids deserve something.

458
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:56,492
And now it's about how do we get there?

459
00:40:56,512 --> 00:41:02,657
And I think I want to thank you because really the process, I mean, you got a lot of

460
00:41:03,479 --> 00:41:04,300
Good points.

461
00:41:04,481 --> 00:41:10,129
I mean, I think people have a better knowledge now of, you know, what this is all about.

462
00:41:10,149 --> 00:41:12,092
Hopefully.

463
00:41:12,352 --> 00:41:12,652
Yeah.

464
00:41:12,773 --> 00:41:13,754
No, I think they do.

465
00:41:14,075 --> 00:41:15,276
I think you did a great job.

466
00:41:15,296 --> 00:41:18,000
You know, I'm being told.

467
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:42,315
uh you know by the boss that you know it's you know we're getting near the end here so it's yeah it's time to say goodbye i can go on for another hour sure i could yeah yeah i was re-educating myself or re-familiarizing myself with this entire process as i as i prepared for this today but there's one point we didn't touch upon that i hear okay here occasionally and it's the timing yep you know well

468
00:41:42,915 --> 00:41:48,521
Oh, my kid's going to be able to go to school next year at the new high school, or the renovated high school.

469
00:41:49,162 --> 00:41:50,303
This process takes time.

470
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:54,487
It could be a year or so, just go through the feasibility.

471
00:41:54,928 --> 00:42:00,333
Then you've got to do design selection for the architects, and you've got to come up with the design.

472
00:42:02,255 --> 00:42:06,537
When all that's done, again, you're behind 23 other communities.

473
00:42:07,238 --> 00:42:20,785
You're also subject to how much money the state puts into the MSBA fund, and that is dictated or influenced by what is the state grappling with in terms of costs for

474
00:42:21,265 --> 00:42:25,626
their programs, their infrastructure upgrades, their budgets.

475
00:42:26,406 --> 00:42:32,027
And when they look at their entire budgets, they'll say how much they're gonna put into these building assistance fund.

476
00:42:32,288 --> 00:42:47,531
So how much money goes in there and also where you sit in queue, that will all dictate, even if you do everything efficiently and get it in early, that will dictate when in fact the money is provided and you can begin your project.

477
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:53,935
So it's, you know, I think I remember when we started in 97, got a lot of that work done in 98.

478
00:42:55,276 --> 00:42:57,837
My daughter was young.

479
00:42:57,957 --> 00:42:59,017
She was in elementary school.

480
00:42:59,037 --> 00:43:01,479
I think she saw one year at the middle school.

481
00:43:02,919 --> 00:43:04,940
So just a reality check.

482
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,120
Yeah.

483
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,602
The reality is we are at the beginning

484
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:11,510
Right?

485
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,892
Of a long project.

486
00:43:14,012 --> 00:43:15,032
It's going to be a while.

487
00:43:15,472 --> 00:43:17,554
So, you know, I don't know what it is today.

488
00:43:17,854 --> 00:43:18,974
You know, we went up to high school.

489
00:43:18,994 --> 00:43:20,655
We were freshmen, you know, whatever.

490
00:43:20,695 --> 00:43:22,917
So, you're a freshman up there now.

491
00:43:22,997 --> 00:43:24,958
Chances are you're not seeing a new school.

492
00:43:24,998 --> 00:43:25,458
No way.

493
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,501
Yeah, it's not going to happen.

494
00:43:32,521 --> 00:43:33,342
That would be a miracle.

495
00:43:33,362 --> 00:43:33,622
OK.

496
00:43:34,042 --> 00:43:34,342
All right.

497
00:43:34,382 --> 00:43:35,322
So that's what I'm saying.

498
00:43:35,342 --> 00:43:36,943
This is like the beginning.

499
00:43:37,123 --> 00:43:39,723
And it's going to be a long process.

500
00:43:41,684 --> 00:43:46,205
And like I say, it's been very interesting for me.

501
00:43:46,225 --> 00:43:51,346
I mean, I think you got some good points out there.

502
00:43:52,726 --> 00:43:53,827
It really is a lot.

503
00:43:53,947 --> 00:43:55,607
And now I'm really being told.

504
00:43:55,627 --> 00:43:58,268
What's this mean, when they tell you that?

505
00:43:58,348 --> 00:43:59,348
You're talking too much, Chuck.

506
00:43:59,728 --> 00:44:00,468
Or I'm talking too much.

507
00:44:01,329 --> 00:44:05,711
All right, well, anyhow, we are at the end of the show.

508
00:44:05,731 --> 00:44:14,275
I want to thank guest Rick Alondo for sharing information people needed to know about building a new high school.

509
00:44:15,396 --> 00:44:19,798
