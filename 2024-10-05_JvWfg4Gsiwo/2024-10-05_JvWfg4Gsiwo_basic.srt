Be it resolved, the Medford City Council observe a moment of silence in memory of former Assistant City Clerk, Dorothy L. Donaghy. Dottie was the Assistant City Clerk for more than 30 years and served as Acting City Clerk for almost two years after the retirement of City Clerk Joseph McGonigal and before the appointment of former City Clerk Ed Finn. Dottie provided long and dedicated service to the city of Medford. Her presence, leadership, kindness, and friendship will be missed. The City Council's offer its deepest condolences, deepest and sincere condolences to her family.

8
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:54,678
be it further resolved that tonight's meeting be dedicated in Dottie's honor. Councilor Carvalho. Thank you, Madam President. This is a sad day for our city. Dottie was an icon in our city hall. Many years, long before any of us were here, Dottie's been here. She's been a rock in that office. Many times she could have been the city clerk anytime she wanted to. She just didn't want to do it. But let's say, always a kind face and always

9
00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:24,108
always there to help people. And it's, uh, you know, she's just retired and, uh, say it's just a sad day. She's an icon in our community, and she's going to be missed. So, um, our condolences go out to her family in the time of sadness. Thank you, Councilor Caravello. Vice President Behrs. Thank you, Madam President. I also wanted to send my condolences to her family and also to her extended City Hall family. I know that her impact has

10
00:04:24,563 --> 00:04:50,922
far outlasted her retirement, that the vault in the clerk's office is dedicated in her name, and that she served over several clerkships, bringing a lot of consistency and passion to her role. So definitely thinking of her family and also thinking of all those who worked with her who are missing her today and for time to come. Thank you.

11
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:59,933
Councilor Sang, Mr. Clerk? Councilor Sang? I never got the chance to meet Boddy, but...

12
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:28,942
when you, I think, look through City Hall, when you look at what's the hard work being achieved here, a lot of it is built on the backs of the greats who came before. And someone like Dottie, whose work has meant so much to Medford and really has pushed our city forward, I think it's an honor to be able to recognize her, even if I didn't get to know her personally, to know her through all of you all.

13
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:43,100
Thank you. Clare Curtis. Dottie was an amazing mentor and a terrific friend.

14
00:05:44,838 --> 00:06:14,234
She was amazingly kind and very, very funny. And she kept things light in the clerk's office when they were serious. And she made us serious when we were getting a little too light. And she knew everything about how that office worked and works. And she had multiple opportunities to be city clerk. She turned the wall down. This is a monumental loss for the city.

15
00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:33,455
Thank you. My condolences to Dottie's family, to her friends. We all miss her terribly already, and I find it incredibly difficult to speak of her in the past tense. Thank you, Mr. Clerk. I'll go to Councilor Collins.

16
00:06:36,762 --> 00:07:05,939
Thank you, President Morrell. I'd just also like to extend my deepest condolences to Dottie's family. This is a sad day for the city. I'll be thinking of her and of the family in coming days. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Collins. And yes, just to echo my fellow councilors, just sending our deepest and sincere condolences and thanking Dottie for her incredible service to the city of Medford and for her family for lending her to the city of Medford for so long.

Madam President, this is the guardrail over by Whole Foods. It's hindering the sidewalk for people to walk over there, especially because that's the only way, there's a crosswalk there on both sides. And it's been like that for several weeks.

29
00:12:48,350 --> 00:13:14,827
The DCI can get out there and replace it as soon as possible. It'd be a great interest of everybody in the community over there. Thank you, Councilor Carviel. And thank you for bringing this up. I think this is perhaps the third time you've had to bring this up. Different crashes each time, but this is an area that continues to get crashed into and leaves kind of a path of destruction every time. So thank you for bringing this forward.

Communications from the Mayor, 23-438, to Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding accelerated new growth.

31
00:13:40,105 --> 00:14:08,776
Dear President Morrell and members of the City Council, I respect the request and recommend that your honorable body accept the provisions of Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 59, Section 2A, which provides that any improvements to real estate during the period beginning January 2nd and ending on June 30th of the fiscal year, preceding that to which the tax relates, shall be deemed part of such real property on the January 1st assessment date for that year effective as of fiscal year 2025. Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 59, Section 2AA,

32
00:14:09,063 --> 00:14:34,308
is a local option statute that allows a community to value and assess new growth, example, new construction, or other physical additions to real property occurring by June 30th for the fiscal year beginning July 1st. This local adoption law, commonly referred to as Chapter 653, allows the community to assess improved parcels, which ensures the property owners pay a fair share of the cost of government operations for the fiscal year beginning July 1st rather than a later date.

33
00:14:35,067 --> 00:15:04,615
If accepted, the vote will take effect in fiscal year 2025, July 1st, 2024 through June 30th, 2025, which has an assessment date of January 1st, 2024. Therefore, any improvements made from January 2nd, 2024 and June 30th, 2024 will be included in the FY 2025 tax assessment. Chief Assessor, Ted Costigan, will be present to provide the council with an overview and answer any questions. Thank you for your kind attention to this matter. Respectfully submitted, Granolongo Kern, Mayor.

34
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:26,519
We have Mr. Costa again here, if councillors have any questions. I know you were helpful enough to talk to a lot of us in advance, just make sure we understood what was before us tonight, so I appreciate that. Any other questions? If we get a brief synopsis of how this works and the effect it has on the community, that'd be great. Yes. Yeah, sure.

35
00:15:26,873 --> 00:15:55,409
So typically, we take a snapshot of every real estate in the city for January 1st, and then that's for the following fiscal year. So usually it lags about six to 18 months. This would kind of eliminate that six-month period and would tie new construction and building permits to that July 1st date, which is the start of the fiscal year. So as the paper said, it ties the valuation

36
00:15:55,645 --> 00:16:21,498
to the fiscal year. They're paying their fair share of valuation, which is tied to the taxes they paid. Surrounding communities, Somerville, Malden, Winchester, Arlington have all adopted this. So it's a helpful provision for us in assessing because we do our building permit work in May, June, July, as opposed to going out in December, January, February. So

37
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:46,118
It's helpful administratively that our building permit season doesn't align with our vacant season. So administratively, it's helpful to staff as well. Thank you. President Behrs. Thank you, and thanks for answering my questions on this. Before, I just have one more. Is there anything with, because it's lining up right with the fiscal year, where there could be like late

38
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:52,447
Probably coming on very late in the prior fiscal year that would be counted in the new fiscal year.

39
00:16:54,134 --> 00:17:22,518
Nope, it just moves up that snapshot six months. So if a building permit is filed by June, we'll be aware of it and be able to value that. As opposed to right now, if a property owner files a February building permit, we can't look at it till the next year, January, which is for the following fiscal year. So it lags quite a bit right now. I appreciate our conversation before. Thank you for mentioning that.

40
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:29,707
Yeah, of course, of course. And is it going to change the date at which we set the rate for the coming year? No. Okay, great. Thank you.

41
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:53,703
Thank you. And if I could, so just, I think just repeating back, as I understand what you said and what we had talked about is essentially cuts down a six month lag time, which helps you administratively, but also I feel like would probably be important in a city, cities like ours, where there is a significant amount of new roof and permits pulled, so making sure we're capturing that kind of as quickly as we can, correct? Exactly. Yeah, that's exactly right.

42
00:17:53,990 --> 00:18:23,892
we will get the benefit in fiscal year 25 of having that sort of extra six month period, but then we're gonna be on a really a fiscal year 12 month period. But yeah, it's helpful for our office, absolutely. Great, thank you. Second. So on the motion of Councilor Carviello to approve, seconded by Councilor Seng, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. Vice President Paris. Yes. Councilor Carviello. Yes. Councilor Collins. Yes.

43
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:54,453
Yes, five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, two absent, the motion passes. Thank you so much.

45
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:52,368
with their duties and to aid in enforcing the laws relating to elections. I motion to transfer decisions regarding decisions regarding staffing of police officers at polling locations to the chief of police or his designate for all elections going forward. Motion second.

50
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:23,652
There we go. Thanks. That was impressive, by the way. Um, the Election Commission is requesting that you accept the warrant for the election as as stated, and it's pretty self explanatory. At this point, the state does require that the City Council does accept it and sign the warrant. Thank you. Any discussion on the council?

51
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:51,412
