This is a sad day for our city.

71
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:36,527
Dottie was an icon in our city hall.

72
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:41,110
Many years, long before any of us were here, Dottie's been here.

73
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,831
She's been a rock in that office.

74
00:03:45,212 --> 00:03:47,914
Many times she could have been the city clerk anytime she wanted to.

75
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:50,035
She just didn't want to do it.

76
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:54,278
But let's say, always a kind face and always

77
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:56,090
always there to help people.

78
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:03,855
And it's, uh, you know, she's just retired and, uh, say it's just a sad day.

79
00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:06,396
She's an icon in our community, and she's going to be missed.

80
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:10,519
So, um, our condolences go out to her family in the time of sadness.

81
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,400
Thank you, Councilor Caravello.

82
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,521
Vice President Behrs.

83
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:14,682
Thank you, Madam President.

84
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:21,166
I also wanted to send my condolences to her family and also to her extended City Hall family.

85
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:23,848
I know that her impact has

86
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:38,733
far outlasted her retirement, that the vault in the clerk's office is dedicated in her name, and that she served over several clerkships, bringing a lot of consistency and passion to her role.

87
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:49,381
So definitely thinking of her family and also thinking of all those who worked with her who are missing her today and for time to come.

88
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:49,881
Thank you.

89
00:04:52,716 --> 00:04:54,119
Councilor Sang, Mr. Clerk?

90
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:55,161
Councilor Sang?

91
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:59,011
I never got the chance to meet Boddy, but...

92
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:10,672
when you, I think, look through City Hall, when you look at what's the hard work being achieved here, a lot of it is built on the backs of the greats who came before.

93
00:05:10,892 --> 00:05:28,762
And someone like Dottie, whose work has meant so much to Medford and really has pushed our city forward, I think it's an honor to be able to recognize her, even if I didn't get to know her personally, to know her through all of you all.

94
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:30,403
Thank you.

95
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:34,168
Clare Curtis.

96
00:05:37,072 --> 00:05:40,296
Dottie was an amazing mentor and a terrific friend.

97
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:47,419
She was amazingly kind and very, very funny.

98
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,622
And she kept things light in the clerk's office when they were serious.

99
00:05:51,702 --> 00:05:54,923
And she made us serious when we were getting a little too light.

100
00:05:55,564 --> 00:06:00,487
And she knew everything about how that office worked and works.

101
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:05,209
And she had multiple opportunities to be city clerk.

102
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:06,070
She turned the wall down.

103
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:13,974
This is a monumental loss for the city.

104
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:16,886
Thank you.

105
00:06:17,447 --> 00:06:19,488
My condolences to Dottie's family, to her friends.

106
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:27,612
We all miss her terribly already, and I find it incredibly difficult to speak of her in the past tense.

107
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:31,354
Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

108
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:33,155

109
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:37,803
Thank you, President Morrell.

110
00:06:37,843 --> 00:06:41,465
I'd just also like to extend my deepest condolences to Dottie's family.

111
00:06:42,165 --> 00:06:43,526
This is a sad day for the city.

112
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:47,088
I'll be thinking of her and of the family in coming days.

113
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:47,648
Thank you.

114
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:49,830

This is where we met with Director of Board of Health, Mary O'Connor, gave us an update and answered some questions as far as the ongoing road issues in the city and the ways she's worked with other departments to address them and just ways in general they're being addressed.

204
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:45,661
Questions of theirs?

00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:50,943
Madam President, motion to join all reports of committees and approve after a short summary of each.

206

We discussed the draft, the latest draft of the budget ordinance.

213
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,421
At this meeting, we're gonna have further meetings on the budget ordinance.

214
00:11:17,322 --> 00:11:24,725
The structure that we came up with was deemed day 100, but we need to work on how long it will take to get to 100.

215
00:11:26,593 --> 00:11:29,455
Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

216
00:11:29,475 --> 00:11:33,017
19070, October 11th, 2023, Committee of the Whole, report to follow tree ordinance.

217
00:11:33,057 --> 00:11:36,640
This was a follow-up meeting on our ongoing work on a draft tree ordinance.

218
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:47,127
We had an updated version of the ordinance that worked off a previous draft that had a number of edits and suggestions from Acting Building Commissioner Forty, and we had a good discussion.

219
00:11:47,147 --> 00:11:56,193
We made some small edits, and we reported those out to Planning, Development, and Sustainability, the Energy and Environment Committee, and then Therese Manford for additional comments at this time.

220
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:02,707

Yes.

223
00:12:03,547 --> 00:12:03,767
Yes.

224
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:04,208

Yes, five in the infirmary is doing the negative to absent the motion passes.

226
00:12:18,386 --> 00:12:22,347
Motions, orders, and resolutions, 23-437, offered by Councilor Carviello.

227
00:12:22,747 --> 00:12:29,349
The fee is so resolved that the Medford City Council have DCR replace the guardrail at Route 16 and Auburn Street in the interest of public safety.

228
00:12:29,469 --> 00:12:30,090
Councilor Carviello.

229
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,170
Thank you, Madam President.

230
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,911
Madam President, this is the guardrail over by Whole Foods.

231
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:44,614
It's hindering the sidewalk for people to walk over there, especially because that's the only way, there's a crosswalk there on both sides.

232
00:12:44,694 --> 00:12:47,355
And it's been like that for several weeks.

233
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,391
The DCI can get out there and replace it as soon as possible.

234
00:12:50,451 --> 00:12:53,733
It'd be a great interest of everybody in the community over there.

235
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,575
Thank you, Councilor Carviel.

236
00:12:56,655 --> 00:12:57,596
And thank you for bringing this up.

237
00:12:57,636 --> 00:13:00,338
I think this is perhaps the third time you've had to bring this up.

238
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:07,122
Different crashes each time, but this is an area that continues to get crashed into and leaves kind of a path of destruction every time.

239
00:13:07,802 --> 00:13:08,943
So thank you for bringing this forward.

240
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:13,426
So on the motion of Councilor Carviel, I'm seconded by Councilor Sang.

241
00:13:13,446 --> 00:13:14,627
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

242
00:13:17,023 --> 00:13:17,683
Vice President Ferris?

243
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:18,423
Yes.

244
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:19,764
Councilor Kerrio?

245
00:13:19,804 --> 00:13:19,984
Yes.

246
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:21,664
Councilor Collins?

247
00:13:22,404 --> 00:13:22,624
Yes.

248
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:24,765
Councilor Dunn is absent.

249
00:13:24,985 --> 00:13:26,045
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

250
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:27,705
Councilor Singh?

251
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:28,886
Present roll?

252
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:32,206
Yes, five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, two absent.

253
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:32,827
Motion passes.

254
00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:39,428
Communications from the Mayor, 23-438, to Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding accelerated new growth.

255
00:13:40,125 --> 00:14:04,574
Dear President Morrell and members of the City Council, I respect the request and recommend that your honorable body accept the provisions of Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 59, Section 2A, which provides that any improvements to real estate during the period beginning January 2nd and ending on June 30th of the fiscal year, preceding that to which the tax relates, shall be deemed part of such real property on the January 1st assessment date for that year effective as of fiscal year 2025.

256
00:14:05,515 --> 00:14:07,496
Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 59, Section 2AA,

257
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:20,885
is a local option statute that allows a community to value and assess new growth, example, new construction, or other physical additions to real property occurring by June 30th for the fiscal year beginning July 1st.

258
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:34,268
This local adoption law, commonly referred to as Chapter 653, allows the community to assess improved parcels, which ensures the property owners pay a fair share of the cost of government operations for the fiscal year beginning July 1st rather than a later date.

259
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:44,550
If accepted, the vote will take effect in fiscal year 2025, July 1st, 2024 through June 30th, 2025, which has an assessment date of January 1st, 2024.

260
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:54,352
Therefore, any improvements made from January 2nd, 2024 and June 30th, 2024 will be included in the FY 2025 tax assessment.

261
00:14:54,772 --> 00:15:00,514
Chief Assessor, Ted Costigan, will be present to provide the council with an overview and answer any questions.

262
00:15:00,554 --> 00:15:02,114
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

263
00:15:02,154 --> 00:15:04,395
Respectfully submitted, Granolongo Kern, Mayor.

264
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:09,140
We have Mr. Costa again here, if councillors have any questions.

265
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:16,728
I know you were helpful enough to talk to a lot of us in advance, just make sure we understood what was before us tonight, so I appreciate that.

266
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:20,032
Any other questions?

267
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:24,717
If we get a brief synopsis of how this works and the effect it has on the community, that'd be great.

268
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:25,158
Yes.

269
00:15:25,678 --> 00:15:26,119
Yeah, sure.

270
00:15:26,973 --> 00:15:36,999
So typically, we take a snapshot of every real estate in the city for January 1st, and then that's for the following fiscal year.

271
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:41,401
So usually it lags about six to 18 months.

272
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:50,786
This would kind of eliminate that six-month period and would tie new construction and building permits to that July 1st date, which is the start of the fiscal year.

273
00:15:50,846 --> 00:15:55,329
So as the paper said, it ties the valuation

274
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:56,545
to the fiscal year.

275
00:15:56,706 --> 00:16:00,227
They're paying their fair share of valuation, which is tied to the taxes they paid.

276
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:08,211
Surrounding communities, Somerville, Malden, Winchester, Arlington have all adopted this.

277
00:16:09,452 --> 00:16:21,198
So it's a helpful provision for us in assessing because we do our building permit work in May, June, July, as opposed to going out in December, January, February.

278
00:16:21,238 --> 00:16:21,358
So

279
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,924
It's helpful administratively that our building permit season doesn't align with our vacant season.

280
00:16:27,024 --> 00:16:29,986
So administratively, it's helpful to staff as well.

281
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:32,308
Thank you.

282
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:34,069
President Behrs.

283
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:37,312
Thank you, and thanks for answering my questions on this.

284
00:16:37,572 --> 00:16:39,293
Before, I just have one more.

285
00:16:39,353 --> 00:16:44,977
Is there anything with, because it's lining up right with the fiscal year, where there could be like late

286
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:52,186
Probably coming on very late in the prior fiscal year that would be counted in the new fiscal year.

287
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:57,317
Nope, it just moves up that snapshot six months.

288
00:16:57,757 --> 00:17:05,884
So if a building permit is filed by June, we'll be aware of it and be able to value that.

289
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:17,033
As opposed to right now, if a property owner files a February building permit, we can't look at it till the next year, January, which is for the following fiscal year.

290
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:19,996
So it lags quite a bit right now.

291
00:17:20,276 --> 00:17:21,597
I appreciate our conversation before.

292
00:17:21,617 --> 00:17:22,438
Thank you for mentioning that.

293
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:23,568
Yeah, of course, of course.

294
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:26,918
And is it going to change the date at which we set the rate for the coming year?

295
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:27,661
No.

296
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:28,764
Okay, great.

297
00:17:28,985 --> 00:17:29,246
Thank you.

298
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:32,027
Thank you.

299
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:51,001
And if I could, so just, I think just repeating back, as I understand what you said and what we had talked about is essentially cuts down a six month lag time, which helps you administratively, but also I feel like would probably be important in a city, cities like ours, where there is a significant amount of new roof and permits pulled, so making sure we're capturing that kind of as quickly as we can, correct?

300
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:51,742
Exactly.

301
00:17:51,902 --> 00:17:53,283
Yeah, that's exactly right.

302
00:17:54,030 --> 00:18:00,915
we will get the benefit in fiscal year 25 of having that sort of extra six month period, but then we're gonna be on a really a fiscal year 12 month period.

303
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:04,718
But yeah, it's helpful for our office, absolutely.

304
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:05,799
Great, thank you.

305
00:18:08,301 --> 00:18:08,801
Second.

306
00:18:09,281 --> 00:18:14,385
So on the motion of Councilor Carviello to approve, seconded by Councilor Seng, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

307
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:18,628
Vice President Paris.

308
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:19,409
Yes.

309
00:18:19,969 --> 00:18:20,570
Councilor Carviello.

310
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,050
Yes.

311
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,771

Thank you so much.

315
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:50,049
Communications from city officials, 23-439, the election commission respectfully request the following be added to the October 17th city council meeting.

318
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:04,021
Designated the police chief as a decision maker regarding office staffing at the election polling locations.

319
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:24,330
Chapter 92, section 72, the select board, board of select midtown council or city council of each city and town in consultation with its elections officers and registrars shall detail a sufficient number of police officers or constables for each building that contains the polling place for one or more precincts at every election therein to preserve order and to protect the election officers and supervisors from any interference,

320

Just kidding.

326
00:19:40,184 --> 00:19:40,985
Thank you for the worksheet.

327

Let's see.

328
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:47,227
I motion to accept the municipal election warrant as written.

329
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:52,128
Does everyone want me to read this or would you like a brief synopsis?

330
00:19:58,527 --> 00:20:01,028

Posted at each polling location at the library and at City Hall.

355
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,620
Going to our election, yeah.

356

I will hand it over to our elections manager at this time.

Oh, just one second, your mic's not on.

There we go.

Thanks.

360
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:03,274
That was impressive, by the way.

361
00:22:03,995 --> 00:22:14,924
Um, the Election Commission is requesting that you accept the warrant for the election as as stated, and it's pretty self explanatory.

362
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:20,329
At this point, the state does require that the City Council does accept it and sign the warrant.

363
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:21,810
Thank you.

364
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:23,472
Any discussion on the council?

365
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:29,554
And that'd be both, both provisions, because there's, okay.

366
00:22:30,054 --> 00:22:39,542
So on the motion of Councilor Carviello to accept both provisions, that would be designated the police chief as the decision maker, and then the municipal election warrants as written.

367
00:22:40,063 --> 00:22:44,606
So on the motion of Councilor Carviello, seconded by Councilor Sang, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

368
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:48,209
Vice President Behrs.

369
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:48,750
Yes.

370
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,871
Councilor Carviello.

371
00:22:50,031 --> 00:22:50,351
Yes.

372
00:22:50,691 --> 00:22:51,232
Councilor Collins.

00:22:58,607 --> 00:23:02,369
Yes, five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, two absent, the motion passes.

378
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:03,890

00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:10,395
Okay, great, thank you.

380
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,039
Councilor Collins is signed.

381
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,442
We can have her come into City Hall and sign later.

382
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:29,880
So I think four is going to be sufficient anyway.

383
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,820
Thank you.

384
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:32,621
Public participation.

385
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:41,784
Is there anyone on Zoom or in person who would like to speak for public participation?

386
00:23:41,864 --> 00:23:46,566
Seeing none, before we adjourn, I do want to note that we'll be meeting again next week for our regular meeting.

387
00:23:46,886 --> 00:23:49,427
On the 24th, we have a slight adjustment to our calendars this month.

388
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:51,868
So we'll have another regular meeting next Tuesday, the 24th.

389
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:56,387
And after that, it'll be two weeks until we have a regular meeting scheduled.

390
00:23:58,447 --> 00:24:01,128
Do I have, yes.

391
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:05,849
So on the motion of Councilor Seng to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

392
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:06,889
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

393
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:11,510
Vice President Behrs?

394
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:11,750
Yes.

395
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:12,711
Councilor Carviello?

396
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:13,151
Yes.

397
00:24:13,471 --> 00:24:14,091
Councilor Collins?

398
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:15,151
Yes.

399
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,152

403
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:23,030
Yes, five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, two absent.

404
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:23,671
The motion passes.

405
00:24:23,692 --> 00:24:24,373
