86
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:38,733

[SPEAKER_01]: I never got the chance to meet Boddy, but...

92
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:10,672
[SPEAKER_01]: when you, I think, look through City Hall, when you look at what's the hard work being achieved here, a lot of it is built on the backs of the greats who came before.

93
00:05:10,892 --> 00:05:28,762
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone like Dottie, whose work has meant so much to Medford and really has pushed our city forward, I think it's an honor to be able to recognize her, even if I didn't get to know her personally, to know her through all of you all.

[SPEAKER_08]: She was amazingly kind and very, very funny.

98
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,622
[SPEAKER_08]: And she kept things light in the clerk's office when they were serious.

99
00:05:51,702 --> 00:05:54,923
[SPEAKER_08]: And she made us serious when we were getting a little too light.

100
00:05:55,564 --> 00:06:00,487
[SPEAKER_08]: And she knew everything about how that office worked and works.

101
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:05,209
[SPEAKER_08]: And she had multiple opportunities to be city clerk.

102
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:06,070
[SPEAKER_08]: She turned the wall down.

103
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:13,974

231
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:44,614

238
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:07,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Different crashes each time, but this is an area that continues to get crashed into and leaves kind of a path of destruction every time.

239
00:13:07,802 --> 00:13:08,943

00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:39,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Communications from the Mayor, 23-438, to Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding accelerated new growth.

255
00:13:40,125 --> 00:14:04,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear President Morell and members of the City Council, I respect the request and recommend that your honorable body accept the provisions of Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 59, Section 2A, which provides that any improvements to real estate during the period beginning January 2nd and ending on June 30th of the fiscal year, preceding that to which the tax relates, shall be deemed part of such real property on the January 1st assessment date for that year effective as of fiscal year 2025.

256
00:14:05,515 --> 00:14:07,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 59, Section 2AA,

257
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:20,885
[SPEAKER_04]: is a local option statute that allows a community to value and assess new growth, example, new construction, or other physical additions to real property occurring by June 30th for the fiscal year beginning July 1st.

258
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:34,268
[SPEAKER_04]: This local adoption law, commonly referred to as Chapter 653, allows the community to assess improved parcels, which ensures the property owners pay a fair share of the cost of government operations for the fiscal year beginning July 1st rather than a later date.

259
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:44,550
[SPEAKER_04]: If accepted, the vote will take effect in fiscal year 2025, July 1st, 2024 through June 30th, 2025, which has an assessment date of January 1st, 2024.

260
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:54,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, any improvements made from January 2nd, 2024 and June 30th, 2024 will be included in the FY 2025 tax assessment.

261
00:14:54,772 --> 00:15:00,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief Assessor, Ted Costigan, will be present to provide the council with an overview and answer any questions.

262
00:15:00,554 --> 00:15:02,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

263
00:15:02,154 --> 00:15:04,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Respectfully submitted, Granolongo Kern, Mayor.

264
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:09,140
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Mr. Costa again here, if councillors have any questions.

265
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:16,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you were helpful enough to talk to a lot of us in advance, just make sure we understood what was before us tonight, so I appreciate that.

266
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:20,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions?

267
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:24,717
[SPEAKER_02]: If we get a brief synopsis of how this works and the effect it has on the community, that'd be great.

268
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:25,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

269
00:15:25,678 --> 00:15:26,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.

270
00:15:26,973 --> 00:15:36,999
[SPEAKER_03]: So typically, we take a snapshot of every real estate in the city for January 1st, and then that's for the following fiscal year.

271
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:41,401
[SPEAKER_03]: So usually it lags about six to 18 months.

272
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:50,786
[SPEAKER_03]: This would kind of eliminate that six-month period and would tie new construction and building permits to that July 1st date, which is the start of the fiscal year.

273
00:15:50,846 --> 00:15:55,329
[SPEAKER_03]: So as the paper said, it ties the valuation

274
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:56,545
[SPEAKER_03]: to the fiscal year.

275
00:15:56,706 --> 00:16:00,227
[SPEAKER_03]: They're paying their fair share of valuation, which is tied to the taxes they paid.

276
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:08,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Surrounding communities, Somerville, Malden, Winchester, Arlington have all adopted this.

277
00:16:09,452 --> 00:16:21,198
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a helpful provision for us in assessing because we do our building permit work in May, June, July, as opposed to going out in December, January, February.

278
00:16:21,238 --> 00:16:21,358
[SPEAKER_03]: So

279
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,924
[SPEAKER_03]: It's helpful administratively that our building permit season doesn't align with our vacant season.

280
00:16:27,024 --> 00:16:29,986
[SPEAKER_03]: So administratively, it's helpful to staff as well.

281
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:32,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

282
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:34,069
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears.

283
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:37,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, and thanks for answering my questions on this.

284
00:16:37,572 --> 00:16:39,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Before, I just have one more.

285
00:16:39,353 --> 00:16:44,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anything with, because it's lining up right with the fiscal year, where there could be like late

286
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:52,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably coming on very late in the prior fiscal year that would be counted in the new fiscal year.

287
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:57,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, it just moves up that snapshot six months.

288
00:16:57,757 --> 00:17:05,884
[SPEAKER_03]: So if a building permit is filed by June, we'll be aware of it and be able to value that.

289
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:17,033
[SPEAKER_03]: As opposed to right now, if a property owner files a February building permit, we can't look at it till the next year, January, which is for the following fiscal year.

290
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:19,996
[SPEAKER_03]: So it lags quite a bit right now.

291
00:17:20,276 --> 00:17:21,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate our conversation before.

292
00:17:21,617 --> 00:17:22,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for mentioning that.

293
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:23,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, of course, of course.

294
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:26,918
[SPEAKER_06]: And is it going to change the date at which we set the rate for the coming year?

295
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:27,661
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

296
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:28,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

297
00:17:28,985 --> 00:17:29,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

298
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:32,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

299
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:51,001
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I could, so just, I think just repeating back, as I understand what you said and what we had talked about is essentially cuts down a six month lag time, which helps you administratively, but also I feel like would probably be important in a city, cities like ours, where there is a significant amount of new roof and permits pulled, so making sure we're capturing that kind of as quickly as we can, correct?

300
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:51,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

301
00:17:51,902 --> 00:17:53,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's exactly right.

302
00:17:54,030 --> 00:18:00,915
[SPEAKER_03]: we will get the benefit in fiscal year 25 of having that sort of extra six month period, but then we're gonna be on a really a fiscal year 12 month period.

303
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:04,718
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's helpful for our office, absolutely.

304
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:05,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:56,387
[SPEAKER_04]: And after that, it'll be two weeks until we have a regular meeting scheduled.
