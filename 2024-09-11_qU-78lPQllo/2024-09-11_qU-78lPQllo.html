    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=768.472s">Thank</a>  you, President Barras. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=772.609s">So</a>  I've been in conversation with, among other people within City Hall, our Board of Health Director, Health Director, Director O'Connor, about some amendments to the rodent control ordinance that she and her team are seeing on their side that they believe could help them better implement best practices and rules for residents and businesses to be part of our multi-pronged approach at mitigating <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=798.815s">the</a>  growing rodent population in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=801.237s">They've</a>  identified some changes that we could make within the text of the ordinance that would give them more latitude to enforce, such as how trash receptacles are placed and maintained on property. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=812.163s">I've</a>  talked to a lot of people in the city and outside about this, and they say one of the problems that we're running into is just that we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=820.888s">keep</a>  it tighter when it comes to how trash and recycling and things that attract rodents, how those are stowed around residential and business areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=830.114s">So</a>  they've identified some changes in the ordinance that they would like for the council to consider that will just make enforcement easier on their side. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=838.98s">We're</a>  considering a committee meeting date for next week just to get the ball moving on that quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=844.144s">And</a>  at the same time, I believe we're also going to consider a paper that's already before the council, an overgrowth ordinance, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=851.388s">which</a>  will have some same hopeful goals of giving the city more tools to where we see those problem areas in the city that are places where rodents are congregating, where the threat population is concentrated, give the city more tools to do enforcement around making sure those are cleaned up so that we're not harboring rodents where we don't need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=874.863s">So</a>  I would motion to move this to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1006.248s">So</a>  there's no conflict.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1016.88s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1018.241s">Next,</a>  we'll go to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1019.743s">First,</a>  we have a petition paper from Cindy Watson. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1023.527s">I</a>  will read it while we welcome Cindy to the stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1025.909s">To</a>  the Honorable City Council of Councilors, the undersigned respectfully pray for support from the City Councilors in recognizing the importance of the Chevalier Theatre. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1033.416s">The</a>  Chevalier is the economic engine for the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1035.799s">Cindy</a>  Watson, 65 Valley Street, 4D, Medford, MA. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1040.624s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1072.235s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1072.995s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1077.157s">Pardon</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1079.097s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1080.278s">I've</a>  come before the City Council many, many times, pre and post Bill Blumenreich presents, and I'll also tell you that I wear my hat on my sleeve, I got a fire in my soul, and sometimes a mouth I can't control, so I'll try to be good during this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1096.641s">As</a>  many of you know, Bill Boomerite took over about five years ago, he just renewed his contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1102.847s">He</a>  is the absolute economic engine for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1106.23s">When</a>  he has a show, businesses are booming. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1110.194s">I</a>  can't tell you how many business owners have come up to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1112.856s">It's</a>  sad that Salvatore's is still vacant. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1117.417s">But</a>  there is a lack of support from the city in all areas, whether it be the city council, school committee, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1127.346s">Had</a>  this meeting, discussions with the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1130.289s">We</a>  just celebrated our 30th anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1133.286s">And</a>  for the life of me, I can't understand why there's not more participation from everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1138.989s">So</a>  I'm here to sort of embrace all of you to get you to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1144.052s">And</a>  I also want to give a couple of highlights that we've done over the last 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1148.735s">And</a>  I want to reiterate that I'm here on behalf of the friends in the Jean Mack Auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1155.498s">Folks</a>  probably don't know that we do a lot, a lot of work for underprivileged children. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1160.768s">through</a>  the former Boys and Girls Club, which is now overseen by the Mystic Y. So again, just so that you can see, all of this came from volunteers, 30 years, half of them are still on the board, doing an incredible amount of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1183.892s">And</a>  again, I'm just gonna give you a brief synopsis. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1187.273s">We've</a>  raised more than $1.4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1191.22s">for</a>  the Gene Mack Gym Recreation Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1196.902s">We</a>  have a tremendous grant writer on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1200.463s">He's</a>  been responsible for spearheading grants that have brought in $500,000 to install air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1210.466s">This</a>  is all volunteer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1211.567s">$88,000</a>  to restore 19 original broken windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1220.377s">$90,000</a>  to restore, I'm sure everybody's seen it, it was an eyesore going down Forest Street, the Chevalier facade. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1228.843s">We're</a>  fortunate to have State Representative Paul Donato on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1234.087s">He</a>  brings in probably through now various governors $100,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1241.392s">People</a>  may or may not know that each ticket that's sold at the Chevalier that Bill has a show <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1249.676s">Sometimes</a>  you can have two or three shows a week, 1,900 seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1253.8s">Let's</a>  take two shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1256.683s">That's</a>  $300 that goes back to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1260.847s">So</a>  again, I could go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1265.051s">But</a>  just for whatever reason, it seems to be a dearth. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1269.395s">of</a>  just participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1271.115s">So</a>  the former city councilors, and maybe a lot of you folks, I don't know as well as the others, but we had a city council that was on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1280.718s">We</a>  had folks that came to our annual meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1284.358s">We</a>  had folks that were very, very enthusiastic about supporting the Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1291.58s">So</a>  I'm here tonight to try to work collaboratively with all of you to help our efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1297.537s">I</a>  mean, I don't see people when we're down at various events in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1302.603s">So</a>  again, it's very frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1305.446s">You</a>  know, we want to work with you to reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1310.748s">We've,</a>  Bill has been unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1313.489s">He's</a>  very philanthropic when he hasn't sold a show out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1317.89s">He'll</a>  give tickets, extra tickets to folks over the senior center, people who are economically advantaged, don't have an opportunity to go to a show. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1327.953s">He</a>  calls me or some of the other board members and will say, listen, he just, there was a show last Saturday, gave 20 seats away. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1338.919s">people</a>  in the city of Medford would never have the opportunity to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1345.165s">We've</a>  also transpired the youth center, as I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1350.229s">These</a>  are kids, again, from diverse backgrounds, have never had the opportunities for educational devices, which we help support. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1358.016s">So</a>  when people think of the Friends of Chevalier, they just think, oh, well, they're working with a theater, but we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1363.321s">It's</a>  a sort of a huge collaborative effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1367.128s">So</a>  I'm asking you to sort of, if you can make more of a presence in the community, maybe start October 24th, come to the annual meeting, maybe become a member. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1378.534s">It's</a>  only $20. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1379.075s">We</a>  are revamping our membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1382.537s">I</a>  mean, I'll admit it needs some work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1385.098s">Maybe</a>  a tiered system that become a member for $100, you'll get a free theater ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1391.172s">But</a>  somehow the city has to recognize the strength of the Chevalier Theater, the board, and all that Bill Blumenreich does. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1402.622s">So</a>  I'm happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1407.706s">To</a>  assist anybody that wants to help us, we meet once a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1412.37s">Like</a>  I said, some of these folks, we've got a 94-year-old woman who's on the board for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1419.281s">May</a>  mark your birth, people probably know us, Citizen of the Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1423.064s">Like</a>  I said, Paul Donato, Ken Crouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1425.826s">I</a>  mean, I can't say enough about the sport. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1428.448s">So</a>  I can recognize him because I'm with him once a month, but I think the city again has to acknowledge the work that the Friends of Chevalier does.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1439.537s">Thank</a>  you, Cindy. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1440.618s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1442.559s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1445.191s">First</a>  and foremost, I do want to thank you for your work.</p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1448.392s">Well,</a>  it's not just me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1449.532s">It's</a>  a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1450.533s">I</a>  know, I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1451.153s">I</a>  was going to get there.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1453.734s">I</a>  was going to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1454.874s">The</a>  friends of the Chevalier and Gene Matcham, I think really do do a lot of work for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1460.556s">I've</a>  been lucky enough to be on the Community Fund Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1464.577s">where</a>  we see the applications from you guys trying to help, you know, we have a limited pot of money with that fund, but, you know, the mayor and I, in particular, advocated to try to make sure you guys got some money there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1478.008s">There's</a>  so much more that needs to be done, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1480.39s">You</a>  see, I mean, really the application, there's <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1484.313s">so</a>  much more that our city could be helping with and funds that we need to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1491.839s">I</a>  think it'd be helpful if we put a resolution on the next agenda, thanking the friends of the Chevalier and GMAC, Jim, for all the work that you've done over the last few decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1502.885s">I,</a>  you mentioned the membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1504.666s">I</a>  was, I was, I was, I was thinking about, you know, just asking everyone in the room here to sign up for a membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1512.75s">I</a>  know you were very persistent with me to remind me to make sure that I signed up for it and I did sign up for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1518.732s">Ken</a>  Kraus and I talk a lot whenever we see each other about what the theater needs and what the square needs in regards to the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1527.516s">the</a>  gym and its deeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1529.797s">I</a>  really enjoyed, I really, I think, value that you brought up the gym as well, because I think people forget about the value of that gym. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1537.242s">But</a>  I remember when I was young, I went, I did programs there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1541.184s">There</a>  are so many, so many of my friends, little brothers and sisters do programs there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1549.281s">I</a>  think I lament if the invitations to us to the annual meetings have slipped through the cracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1555.667s">I</a>  know we all get a lot of invitations as councillors, and I just wanted to ask through the chair if you could send us that invitation to the annual meeting again, just to make sure we all have it in our inboxes as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1569.804s">but</a>  I am grateful for the work that you all do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1572.906s">And</a>  I know it's not just you, and I know it's not just Ken, it's many people pulling the operation together. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1579.191s">And</a>  I appreciate you coming here tonight to keep us accountable and keep us on our toes.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1588.838s">I</a>  think that's what you're saying, Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1594.735s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1595.155s">Thank</a>  you so much for coming tonight I really appreciate it, especially knowing that there is a another even more star studded event that you could have been at tonight thank you so much for coming and speaking to us and, you know, continuing to raise the profile of Australia and in addition to all the work that you and the rest of the board is doing every week and every month we really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1615.598s">And</a>  I appreciate the, you know, kind of the reminder the call to action of how much this team is doing behind the scenes week in and week out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1625.203s">I</a>  know as a Councilor, one thing that I'm that I think we're always keeping an eye on kind of on an annual basis is making sure that the casino mitigation funds I know that there's a portion of that that's earmarked for the Chevalier, we want to make sure that that <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1637.188s">remains</a>  because it's so important for this very uniquely Medford institution to be able to stay important, stay special, and stay competitive when these like very large corporate venues such as Encore do come into the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1651.774s">In</a>  addition, I've always really valued getting those like snapshots of progress and whenever the Chevalier comes forward with the CPA application, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1660.774s">It's</a>  always like this incredible pamphlet of what's been going on and how much more there is to do, whether it's restoring the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1667.341s">I</a>  know there was a big organ restoration project that was wrapped up the past couple years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1671.967s">Anyway,</a>  I know that's just really scratching the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how much is going on behind those doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1677.679s">every</a>  year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1679.339s">So</a>  thank you for, you know, platforming the membership drive, the annual meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1683.8s">I</a>  would love to get more involved and get a little bit more into the details about what you all are working on all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1690.262s">I</a>  think as Councilors, and especially as, you know, as residents, whenever the Chevalier is bringing in, you know, another great act every weekend, you see the cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1698.763s">I</a>  know there's so often that I'm like walking down Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1701.424s">I'm</a>  like, wow, they got that person? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1703.184s">Amazing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1703.904s">What</a>  a pull. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1705.725s">So</a>  it's visible. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1707.782s">what</a>  an incredible theater this is here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1709.843s">And,</a>  you know, it shouldn't go without saying how much work goes into keeping it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1713.884s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1715.105s">It's</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1715.705s">We</a>  had to fight like hell to, you know, fought off Wynn at the Everett Casino because they were a huge threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1724.868s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1725.768s">And</a>  we worked very, very hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1727.789s">You</a>  know, we were some elite folks in addition to others, but it was, it was close.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1736.792s">Cindy,</a>  thank you so much for coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1739.153s">I</a>  just want to thank you and the friends for all the work that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1742.634s">You</a>  know, whenever we see a CPA application or community fund or whatever it might be, I know we want to support the Chevalier as much as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1748.936s">And</a>  supporting the friends is a key part of that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1752.677s">and</a>  the organ society and all the other folks who have done so much for the for the building, you know, I'm on the Brooks estate board. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1759.243s">So</a>  I kind of understand firsthand a little bit what it feels like sometimes when you're trying to raise money for the city owned property, and then the city is not pitching in services and resources that are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1771.093s">You</a>  know, I am an advocate of trying to put more of the city's funds into supporting Chevalier directly, I know that there's a very <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1777.979s">very</a>  small amount of money that's going to support Chevalier right now from the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1783.442s">And</a>  I think that's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1785.483s">So</a>  thank you for coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1786.804s">And</a>  I do want to just ask, not just for us, but to share with anyone who may be watching, what's the best way that folks can join as a member? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1793.927s">Is</a>  there a website to go to? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1795.728s">And</a>  what's the best way to sign up for the annual meeting?</p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1799.41s">You</a>  can let me know, because it will be at the condo that I live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1802.712s">So</a>  it's the association room. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1808.703s">So</a>  I'm assuming that everybody will be there on the 24th?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1812.945s">I</a>  can't promise everybody, but sure, some of us will attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1817.787s">But</a>  if the public wants to attend, how can they find out more and sign up?</p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1822.29s">There's</a>  plenty of info on the website, and we do send out a membership drive a month prior to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1827.792s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1828.392s">Approximately.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1830.173s">And</a>  is it friends, what's the URL? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1835.111s">friendsofthechevalier.com?</a> </p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1836.371s">Yes,</a>  that's actually another website, Zach, that we're revamping. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1839.953s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1840.293s">So</a>  that should be up and running within a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1842.294s">There</a>  was some problems, some issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1845.034s">But</a>  you can go on, you know, the computer, just look under other friends and you'll, there's ample information.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1850.196s">Great,</a>  thank you so much, Cindy.</p>

    <p>[Amante]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2181.462s">I</a>  think overall, this business has been increasing more towards the late night, especially on the Friday, Saturday, Sunday area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2188.854s">So</a>  we do see the higher volume on those days. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2193.641s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2291.183s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Radzig]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2297.226s">I'm</a>  Chris Radzig from the National Grid District Design Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2300.988s">And</a>  online, we have Mark Riley, the Assistant General Counsel for National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2307.272s">We're</a>  here to speak on the amendment request for a grant of location previously <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2314.011s">approved</a>  by the Council last November. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2321.357s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2322.958s">Yes,</a>  we can hear you.</p>

    <p>[Rielly]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2334.861s">Yeah,</a>  a brief background might be helpful, um, because it's been a while since November, since the city last saw this petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2342.325s">Uh,</a>  it was a petition that, uh, which was granted to install underground electrical conduit on main street, um, close to the intersection of South street and then about 370 feet Southward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2355.412s">Um,</a>  the company had met with Mr. Wartell and others to regarding the project and, um, had <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2362.662s">come</a>  to what we thought was an agreement about street restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2366.784s">And</a>  then that was reflected on a civil drawing that Chris has and can hand out, because I think it was erroneously left off when we filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2378.251s">It</a>  was supposed to be attached to the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2382.233s">During</a>  the hearing, the city council hearing, an additional condition was added that required the company to repair other streets that weren't affected by the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2392.882s">Um,</a>  and then that, and then in addition, subsequent to the hearing and further conversations with, um, Mr. Wartell, it became clear that we didn't quite agree on certain aspects of the restoration in particular, what was meant by curb to curb repaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2408.688s">So,</a>  um, we're here to sort of remedy that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2413.41s">Um,</a>  and the, the specifics of the requests are in the letter, but in some, um, we. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2422.085s">Our</a>  proposal is to amend the condition to remove the requirement to repair or repave irrelevant streets, and then to allow us to either restore Main Street curb to median curb, or to pay the SPOF per section 74-1442B. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2441.672s">And</a>  I can get into the explanation of <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2449.733s">our</a>  objections to restoring streets that aren't being disturbed, if you'd like, but I'll pause there.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2459.497s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2459.897s">And</a>  if I remember correctly, if I may, just that what we had requested was that if there was a certain amount of pavement that was not going to be restored, that it be <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2470.578s">the</a>  restore other pavement in lieu of restoring that pavement. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2472.999s">I</a>  believe that was the condition so that the square footage of pavement would, that would be the same that was restored or saying no.</p>

    <p>[Radzig]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2480.184s">That</a>  was the general gist of yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2483.145s">The</a>  requirements.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2484.246s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2484.606s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2484.946s">I</a>  welcome his hard work.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2500.242s">that</a>  the biggest issues we have is that when they do open the streets, not just, not your company, but we're seeing too many, too many jobs that are left half done, and it's creating more havoc when people leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2516.334s">And</a>  I think the biggest piece is having a curb-to-curb process. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2521.939s">That's</a>  something that, to me, as one councilor, is a non-negotiable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2527.003s">But</a>  from what I, just for clarification, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2531.397s">Are</a>  we saying that the roads that we're requesting, they will be paved curb to curb, but we're asking for other streets that are impacted to be repaved? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2546.742s">I</a>  just need some clarification on that.</p>
