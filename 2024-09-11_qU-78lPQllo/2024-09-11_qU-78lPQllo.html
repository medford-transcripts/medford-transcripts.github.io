 <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=759.145s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Committee on Public Health and Community Safety meet with the Health Director to consider updates to the Road and Control Ordinance, Chapter 6, Article 4. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=766.01s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=768.472s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=772.609s">So</a>  I've been in conversation with, among other people within City Hall, our Board of Health Director, Health Director, Director O'Connor, about some amendments to the rodent control ordinance that she and her team are seeing on their side that they believe could help them better implement best practices and rules for residents and businesses to be part of our multi-pronged approach at mitigating <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=798.815s">the</a>  growing rodent population in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=801.237s">They've</a>  identified some changes that we could make within the text of the ordinance that would give them more latitude to enforce, such as how trash receptacles are placed and maintained on property. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=812.163s">I've</a>  talked to a lot of people in the city and outside about this, and they say one of the problems that we're running into is just that we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=820.888s">keep</a>  it tighter when it comes to how trash and recycling and things that attract rodents, how those are stowed around residential and business areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=830.114s">So</a>  they've identified some changes in the ordinance that they would like for the council to consider that will just make enforcement easier on their side. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=838.98s">We're</a>  considering a committee meeting date for next week just to get the ball moving on that quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=844.144s">And</a>  at the same time, I believe we're also going to consider a paper that's already before the council, an overgrowth ordinance, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=851.388s">which</a>  will have some same hopeful goals of giving the city more tools to where we see those problem areas in the city that are places where rodents are congregating, where the threat population is concentrated, give the city more tools to do enforcement around making sure those are cleaned up so that we're not harboring rodents where we don't need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=874.863s">So</a>  I would motion to move this to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1006.248s">So</a>  there's no conflict.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1016.88s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1018.241s">Next,</a>  we'll go to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1019.743s">First,</a>  we have a petition paper from Cindy Watson. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1023.527s">I</a>  will read it while we welcome Cindy to the stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1025.909s">To</a>  the Honorable City Council of Councilors, the undersigned respectfully pray for support from the City Councilors in recognizing the importance of the Chevalier Theatre. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1033.416s">The</a>  Chevalier is the economic engine for the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1035.799s">Cindy</a>  Watson, 65 Valley Street, 4D, Medford, MA. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1040.624s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1072.235s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1072.995s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1077.157s">Pardon</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1079.097s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1080.278s">I've</a>  come before the City Council many, many times, pre and post Bill Blumenreich presents, and I'll also tell you that I wear my hat on my sleeve, I got a fire in my soul, and sometimes a mouth I can't control, so I'll try to be good during this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1096.641s">As</a>  many of you know, Bill Boomerite took over about five years ago, he just renewed his contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1102.847s">He</a>  is the absolute economic engine for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1106.23s">When</a>  he has a show, businesses are booming. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1110.194s">I</a>  can't tell you how many business owners have come up to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1112.856s">It's</a>  sad that Salvatore's is still vacant. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1117.417s">But</a>  there is a lack of support from the city in all areas, whether it be the city council, school committee, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1127.346s">Had</a>  this meeting, discussions with the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1130.289s">We</a>  just celebrated our 30th anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1133.286s">And</a>  for the life of me, I can't understand why there's not more participation from everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1138.989s">So</a>  I'm here to sort of embrace all of you to get you to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1144.052s">And</a>  I also want to give a couple of highlights that we've done over the last 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1148.735s">And</a>  I want to reiterate that I'm here on behalf of the friends in the Jean Mack Auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1155.498s">Folks</a>  probably don't know that we do a lot, a lot of work for underprivileged children. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1160.768s">through</a>  the former Boys and Girls Club, which is now overseen by the Mystic Y. So again, just so that you can see, all of this came from volunteers, 30 years, half of them are still on the board, doing an incredible amount of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1183.892s">And</a>  again, I'm just gonna give you a brief synopsis. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1187.273s">We've</a>  raised more than $1.4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1191.22s">for</a>  the Gene Mack Gym Recreation Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1196.902s">We</a>  have a tremendous grant writer on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1200.463s">He's</a>  been responsible for spearheading grants that have brought in $500,000 to install air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1210.466s">This</a>  is all volunteer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1211.567s">$88,000</a>  to restore 19 original broken windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1220.377s">$90,000</a>  to restore, I'm sure everybody's seen it, it was an eyesore going down Forest Street, the Chevalier facade. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1228.843s">We're</a>  fortunate to have State Representative Paul Donato on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1234.087s">He</a>  brings in probably through now various governors $100,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1241.392s">People</a>  may or may not know that each ticket that's sold at the Chevalier that Bill has a show <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1249.676s">Sometimes</a>  you can have two or three shows a week, 1,900 seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1253.8s">Let's</a>  take two shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1256.683s">That's</a>  $300 that goes back to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1260.847s">So</a>  again, I could go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1265.051s">But</a>  just for whatever reason, it seems to be a dearth. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1269.395s">of</a>  just participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1271.115s">So</a>  the former city councilors, and maybe a lot of you folks, I don't know as well as the others, but we had a city council that was on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1280.718s">We</a>  had folks that came to our annual meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1284.358s">We</a>  had folks that were very, very enthusiastic about supporting the Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1291.58s">So</a>  I'm here tonight to try to work collaboratively with all of you to help our efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1297.537s">I</a>  mean, I don't see people when we're down at various events in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1302.603s">So</a>  again, it's very frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1305.446s">You</a>  know, we want to work with you to reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1310.748s">We've,</a>  Bill has been unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1313.489s">He's</a>  very philanthropic when he hasn't sold a show out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1317.89s">He'll</a>  give tickets, extra tickets to folks over the senior center, people who are economically advantaged, don't have an opportunity to go to a show. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1327.953s">He</a>  calls me or some of the other board members and will say, listen, he just, there was a show last Saturday, gave 20 seats away. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1338.919s">people</a>  in the city of Medford would never have the opportunity to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1345.165s">We've</a>  also transpired the youth center, as I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1350.229s">These</a>  are kids, again, from diverse backgrounds, have never had the opportunities for educational devices, which we help support. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1358.016s">So</a>  when people think of the Friends of Chevalier, they just think, oh, well, they're working with a theater, but we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1363.321s">It's</a>  a sort of a huge collaborative effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1367.128s">So</a>  I'm asking you to sort of, if you can make more of a presence in the community, maybe start October 24th, come to the annual meeting, maybe become a member. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1378.534s">It's</a>  only $20. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1379.075s">We</a>  are revamping our membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1382.537s">I</a>  mean, I'll admit it needs some work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1385.098s">Maybe</a>  a tiered system that become a member for $100, you'll get a free theater ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1391.172s">But</a>  somehow the city has to recognize the strength of the Chevalier Theater, the board, and all that Bill Blumenreich does. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1402.622s">So</a>  I'm happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1407.706s">To</a>  assist anybody that wants to help us, we meet once a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1412.37s">Like</a>  I said, some of these folks, we've got a 94-year-old woman who's on the board for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1419.281s">May</a>  mark your birth, people probably know us, Citizen of the Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1423.064s">Like</a>  I said, Paul Donato, Ken Crouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1425.826s">I</a>  mean, I can't say enough about the sport. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1428.448s">So</a>  I can recognize him because I'm with him once a month, but I think the city again has to acknowledge the work that the Friends of Chevalier does.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1439.537s">Thank</a>  you, Cindy. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1440.618s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1442.559s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1445.191s">First</a>  and foremost, I do want to thank you for your work.</p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1448.392s">Well,</a>  it's not just me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1449.532s">It's</a>  a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1450.533s">I</a>  know, I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1451.153s">I</a>  was going to get there.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1453.734s">I</a>  was going to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1454.874s">The</a>  friends of the Chevalier and Gene Matcham, I think really do do a lot of work for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1460.556s">I've</a>  been lucky enough to be on the Community Fund Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1464.577s">where</a>  we see the applications from you guys trying to help, you know, we have a limited pot of money with that fund, but, you know, the mayor and I, in particular, advocated to try to make sure you guys got some money there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1478.008s">There's</a>  so much more that needs to be done, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1480.39s">You</a>  see, I mean, really the application, there's <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1484.313s">so</a>  much more that our city could be helping with and funds that we need to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1491.839s">I</a>  think it'd be helpful if we put a resolution on the next agenda, thanking the friends of the Chevalier and GMAC, Jim, for all the work that you've done over the last few decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1502.885s">I,</a>  you mentioned the membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1504.666s">I</a>  was, I was, I was, I was thinking about, you know, just asking everyone in the room here to sign up for a membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1512.75s">I</a>  know you were very persistent with me to remind me to make sure that I signed up for it and I did sign up for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1518.732s">Ken</a>  Kraus and I talk a lot whenever we see each other about what the theater needs and what the square needs in regards to the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1527.516s">the</a>  gym and its deeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1529.797s">I</a>  really enjoyed, I really, I think, value that you brought up the gym as well, because I think people forget about the value of that gym. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1537.242s">But</a>  I remember when I was young, I went, I did programs there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1541.184s">There</a>  are so many, so many of my friends, little brothers and sisters do programs there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1549.281s">I</a>  think I lament if the invitations to us to the annual meetings have slipped through the cracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1555.667s">I</a>  know we all get a lot of invitations as councillors, and I just wanted to ask through the chair if you could send us that invitation to the annual meeting again, just to make sure we all have it in our inboxes as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1569.804s">but</a>  I am grateful for the work that you all do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1572.906s">And</a>  I know it's not just you, and I know it's not just Ken, it's many people pulling the operation together. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1579.191s">And</a>  I appreciate you coming here tonight to keep us accountable and keep us on our toes.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1588.838s">I</a>  think that's what you're saying, Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1594.735s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1595.155s">Thank</a>  you so much for coming tonight I really appreciate it, especially knowing that there is a another even more star studded event that you could have been at tonight thank you so much for coming and speaking to us and, you know, continuing to raise the profile of Australia and in addition to all the work that you and the rest of the board is doing every week and every month we really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1615.598s">And</a>  I appreciate the, you know, kind of the reminder the call to action of how much this team is doing behind the scenes week in and week out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1625.203s">I</a>  know as a Councilor, one thing that I'm that I think we're always keeping an eye on kind of on an annual basis is making sure that the casino mitigation funds I know that there's a portion of that that's earmarked for the Chevalier, we want to make sure that that <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1637.188s">remains</a>  because it's so important for this very uniquely Medford institution to be able to stay important, stay special, and stay competitive when these like very large corporate venues such as Encore do come into the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1651.774s">In</a>  addition, I've always really valued getting those like snapshots of progress and whenever the Chevalier comes forward with the CPA application, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1660.774s">It's</a>  always like this incredible pamphlet of what's been going on and how much more there is to do, whether it's restoring the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1667.341s">I</a>  know there was a big organ restoration project that was wrapped up the past couple years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1671.967s">Anyway,</a>  I know that's just really scratching the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how much is going on behind those doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1677.679s">every</a>  year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1679.339s">So</a>  thank you for, you know, platforming the membership drive, the annual meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1683.8s">I</a>  would love to get more involved and get a little bit more into the details about what you all are working on all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1690.262s">I</a>  think as Councilors, and especially as, you know, as residents, whenever the Chevalier is bringing in, you know, another great act every weekend, you see the cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1698.763s">I</a>  know there's so often that I'm like walking down Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1701.424s">I'm</a>  like, wow, they got that person? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1703.184s">Amazing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1703.904s">What</a>  a pull. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1705.725s">So</a>  it's visible. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1707.782s">what</a>  an incredible theater this is here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1709.843s">And,</a>  you know, it shouldn't go without saying how much work goes into keeping it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1713.884s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1715.105s">It's</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1715.705s">We</a>  had to fight like hell to, you know, fought off Wynn at the Everett Casino because they were a huge threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1724.868s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1725.768s">And</a>  we worked very, very hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1727.789s">You</a>  know, we were some elite folks in addition to others, but it was, it was close.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1736.792s">Cindy,</a>  thank you so much for coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1739.153s">I</a>  just want to thank you and the friends for all the work that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1742.634s">You</a>  know, whenever we see a CPA application or community fund or whatever it might be, I know we want to support the Chevalier as much as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1748.936s">And</a>  supporting the friends is a key part of that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1752.677s">and</a>  the organ society and all the other folks who have done so much for the for the building, you know, I'm on the Brooks estate board. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1759.243s">So</a>  I kind of understand firsthand a little bit what it feels like sometimes when you're trying to raise money for the city owned property, and then the city is not pitching in services and resources that are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1771.093s">You</a>  know, I am an advocate of trying to put more of the city's funds into supporting Chevalier directly, I know that there's a very <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1777.979s">very</a>  small amount of money that's going to support Chevalier right now from the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1783.442s">And</a>  I think that's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1785.483s">So</a>  thank you for coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1786.804s">And</a>  I do want to just ask, not just for us, but to share with anyone who may be watching, what's the best way that folks can join as a member? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1793.927s">Is</a>  there a website to go to? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1795.728s">And</a>  what's the best way to sign up for the annual meeting?</p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1799.41s">You</a>  can let me know, because it will be at the condo that I live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1802.712s">So</a>  it's the association room. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1808.703s">So</a>  I'm assuming that everybody will be there on the 24th?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1812.945s">I</a>  can't promise everybody, but sure, some of us will attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1817.787s">But</a>  if the public wants to attend, how can they find out more and sign up?</p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1822.29s">There's</a>  plenty of info on the website, and we do send out a membership drive a month prior to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1827.792s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1828.392s">Approximately.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1830.173s">And</a>  is it friends, what's the URL? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1835.111s">friendsofthechevalier.com?</a> </p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1836.371s">Yes,</a>  that's actually another website, Zach, that we're revamping. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1839.953s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1840.293s">So</a>  that should be up and running within a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1842.294s">There</a>  was some problems, some issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1845.034s">But</a>  you can go on, you know, the computer, just look under other friends and you'll, there's ample information.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1850.196s">Great,</a>  thank you so much, Cindy.</p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1851.617s">All</a>  right, thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Amante]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2181.462s">I</a>  think overall, this business has been increasing more towards the late night, especially on the Friday, Saturday, Sunday area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2188.854s">So</a>  we do see the higher volume on those days. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2193.641s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

President Bears?, the reading in favor of summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2257.451s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2259.092s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2259.472s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2260.993s">There</a>  is a request from National Grid to the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2264.594s">There's</a>  a petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2266.055s">There's</a>  a grant location application that was previously approved, and this is a request for amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2270.498s">We've</a>  received communications from KP Law and City Engineer Wartella. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2274.64s">The</a>  folks that want, I could read them, but, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2284.599s">Do</a>  we have a synopsis from the engineer? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2288.121s">Sure,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2289.001s">Do</a>  we have a brief synopsis of the request?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2291.183s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Radzig]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2297.226s">I'm</a>  Chris Radzig from the National Grid District Design Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2300.988s">And</a>  online, we have Mark Riley, the Assistant General Counsel for National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2307.272s">We're</a>  here to speak on the amendment request for a grant of location previously <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2314.011s">approved</a>  by the Council last November. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2321.357s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2322.958s">Yes,</a>  we can hear you.</p>

    <p>[Rielly]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2334.861s">Yeah,</a>  a brief background might be helpful, um, because it's been a while since November, since the city last saw this petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2342.325s">Uh,</a>  it was a petition that, uh, which was granted to install underground electrical conduit on main street, um, close to the intersection of South street and then about 370 feet Southward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2355.412s">Um,</a>  the company had met with Mr. Wartell and others to regarding the project and, um, had <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2362.662s">come</a>  to what we thought was an agreement about street restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2366.784s">And</a>  then that was reflected on a civil drawing that Chris has and can hand out, because I think it was erroneously left off when we filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2378.251s">It</a>  was supposed to be attached to the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2382.233s">During</a>  the hearing, the city council hearing, an additional condition was added that required the company to repair other streets that weren't affected by the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2392.882s">Um,</a>  and then that, and then in addition, subsequent to the hearing and further conversations with, um, Mr. Wartell, it became clear that we didn't quite agree on certain aspects of the restoration in particular, what was meant by curb to curb repaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2408.688s">So,</a>  um, we're here to sort of remedy that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2413.41s">Um,</a>  and the, the specifics of the requests are in the letter, but in some, um, we. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2422.085s">Our</a>  proposal is to amend the condition to remove the requirement to repair or repave irrelevant streets, and then to allow us to either restore Main Street curb to median curb, or to pay the SPOF per section 74-1442B. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2441.672s">And</a>  I can get into the explanation of <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2449.733s">our</a>  objections to restoring streets that aren't being disturbed, if you'd like, but I'll pause there.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2459.497s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2459.897s">And</a>  if I remember correctly, if I may, just that what we had requested was that if there was a certain amount of pavement that was not going to be restored, that it be <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2470.578s">the</a>  restore other pavement in lieu of restoring that pavement. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2472.999s">I</a>  believe that was the condition so that the square footage of pavement would, that would be the same that was restored or saying no.</p>

    <p>[Radzig]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2480.184s">That</a>  was the general gist of yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2483.145s">The</a>  requirements.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2484.246s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2484.606s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2484.946s">I</a>  welcome his hard work.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2500.242s">that</a>  the biggest issues we have is that when they do open the streets, not just, not your company, but we're seeing too many, too many jobs that are left half done, and it's creating more havoc when people leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2516.334s">And</a>  I think the biggest piece is having a curb-to-curb process. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2521.939s">That's</a>  something that, to me, as one councilor, is a non-negotiable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2527.003s">But</a>  from what I, just for clarification, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2531.397s">Are</a>  we saying that the roads that we're requesting, they will be paved curb to curb, but we're asking for other streets that are impacted to be repaved? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2546.742s">I</a>  just need some clarification on that.</p>

    <p>[Rielly]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2550.003s">Yeah,</a>  I think there's sort of two issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2555.045s">There</a>  was a curb to curb, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2558.294s">What</a>  grid understood at the hearing and in earlier discussions with the city engineer was that curb to curb meant that we would restore curb to the median curb, you know, the next nearest curb, which was the median strip. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2578.704s">The</a>  city engineer is taking the position that it should be curb to the, across the median to the other side of Main Street, which we're not touching. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2588.727s">Um,</a>  and it, it exceeds any disturbed area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2592.73s">Um,</a>  we're willing to, to restore for the, for the length of our trench. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2600.316s">We're</a>  willing to restore main street curb to median curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2604.339s">Um,</a>  so there was that dispute about what curb to curb meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2609.283s">The</a>  second piece was that, um, you know, having to repair roads that we weren't touching at all that weren't main street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2618.573s">Um,</a>  and that's, you know, if, if nothing else happens today, that that has to come off, that's just a non-starter because as you can imagine, you know, grid is always kind of in the position of having to navigate requests from municipalities across our service territory. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2637.945s">And</a>  if, if, whether it's Medford or someone else is asking us to repair <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2643.345s">different</a>  roads and we're disturbing, that's going to increase costs tremendously to everyone's detriment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2650.387s">So</a>  we have to be a gatekeeper on that type of thing.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2659.15s">Okay,</a>  Mr. President, if I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2661.671s">Sure,</a>  I just wanna, go ahead, Councilor Scarpelli, then we'll go to Vice President Collins and Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2667.072s">I</a>  can also read the letter from council to the city.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2669.633s">Okay,</a>  I too am a little leery of, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2673.484s">of</a>  the impact that this will make not only for the increased costs that would be then put on our ratepayers within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2685.083s">I</a>  know that because National Grid's not going to <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2687.369s">We're</a>  not going to take it on the chin, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2688.95s">I</a>  mean, it's going to be passed off somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2691.591s">But</a>  as I'm looking at it online, where we're looking at South Street and traversing down Main Street, I know exactly what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2701.836s">That</a>  median was already developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2704.097s">That</a>  was in front of the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2707.179s">Is</a>  that where?</p>

    <p>[Radzig]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2707.819s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2708.219s">So</a>  that's already been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2711.713s">Yeah,</a>  I could see your apprehension with that going across the street of the medium, because if I can ask the city engineer in this map and taking this route, even today, I didn't see, it didn't seem to be uneven or really damaged in that area on the other side of the medium anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2741.323s">where</a>  we're seeing the work being done down South Street and all the way down Main Street, that is a no brainer of curb to curb, but that's something that I'd have to consider now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2754.995s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2757.116s">I</a>  could read the letter from Council if that would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2759.558s">I</a>  just wanted to get that summary out there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2765.062s">Dear</a>  Attorney Riley, thank you for your letter made 29th address to the City Engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2769.826s">The</a>  City of Medford has asked us to respond as Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2771.928s">We</a>  have consulted with City Engineer, Director of Public Works and the Mayor in making this response. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2776.351s">then</a>  location as you know this matter concerns the proper interpretation of that certain grant of location 23445 issued by the city council on November 14 2023 approving national bridge petition to construct a line of electric underground electric conduits in main street at the location specified <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2791.348s">The</a>  installation requires cutting and excavating a trench in the Main Street pavement for a length of approximately 370 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2795.372s">Main</a>  Street in this location was fully reconstructed less than five years ago and contains a median strip separating opposing lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2803.378s">This</a>  median strip is laid on top of the pavement bed, extending as a unbroken hall from the curb on one side of the roadway to the curb on the far side. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2811.025s">As</a>  a condition of the grant of location, the City Council required National Grid to provide repaving of another roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2816.87s">equal</a>  to the work associated with curb-to-curb roadway restoration within the limits of the Main Street project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2822.135s">Curb-to-curb</a>  is an industry standard term referring to the full width of the roadway, and the restoration condition must be interpreted as such. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2828.381s">The</a>  Council is familiar with the roadway in question, and if the Council's intent was to limit restoration limits to curb-to-median curb, it could have so specified. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2837.369s">Please</a>  further note that Main Street is not a quote divided road. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2840.352s">That</a>  term is used specifically in the industry for highways and state routes with a large median frequently unpaved and northbound southbound designations. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2847.18s">Main</a>  Street is not designated that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2849.683s">Restoration</a>  standard, the city readily acknowledges the authority of the Commonwealth to regulate the placement of utility lines in the city streets and with the application order DTE 98-22. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2859.213s">entitled</a>  standards to be employed by public utility operators when restoring any of the streets, lanes, and highways and municipalities as an extension of that authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2866.355s">In</a>  particular, section nine of the order sets forth the standards for pavement restoration following disturbance by utility. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2872.518s">Section</a>  9.1 provides that quote, all pavement disturbed by the work, unquote, shall be replaced with quote, homogeneous and in-kind pavement to the original strength and condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2881.461s">Quote,</a>  homogeneous is defined as of uniform structure or composition throughout. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2885.842s">Sections</a>  9.2 through 9.15, 9.15 set forth particular standards relative to pavement restoration without regard to the age of the roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2896.492s">Section</a>  9.16, however, provides that the municipality quote, shall have a jurisdiction to determine the pavement repair method <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2902.617s">to</a>  be utilized on all pavements which have been installed for less than five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2906.379s">Pursuant</a>  to the grant location, the City of Medford has determined that the work proposed in Main Street, a street reconstructed within the past five years, requires curb-to-curb restoration within the project limits or its equivalent. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2916.765s">As</a>  set forth in Section 9.16, quote, method is simply the procedure for accomplishing the task, and a curb-to-curb restoration is the method the City has reasonably selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2926.671s">pursuant</a>  to section 9.16 of the order to restore Main Street to its original strength and condition, the structural integrity and life of a paved street as a whole is compromised by partial exclamations and patches, and such compromises can be avoided by curb-to-curb reconstruction to maintain the structural integrity of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2942.442s">The</a>  case, Colonial Gloss versus Town of Wilmington, cited by National Register for its interpretation of pavement with restoration requirements does not concern the disturbance of city streets reconstructed within the past five years, and thus does not apply to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2955.231s">The</a>  timing of restoration work, the terms and conditions for work in public streets allowed by a grant of location are determined by the appropriate permanent authority as designated by section 74-141 of the city ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2965.597s">In</a>  this case, the permitting authority for the Main Street project as approved and conditioned by the city council is the engineering division of the Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2973.082s">As</a>  you are aware, National Grid attempted to bypass the permitting process by contacting the DPW commissioner directly after meeting with the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2980.086s">Requiring</a>  the restoration work prior to commencing the Main Street project is essential to the city to ensure that the required work is satisfactorily completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2987.149s">National</a>  Grid has repeatedly not completed promised work, one still being from 2019, and therefore the permit authority engineering is conditioning the permit for the Main Street project accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2997.613s">Thank</a>  you for your attention to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2999.454s">If</a>  you have questions, please do not hesitate to contact me, very truly yours, Jonathan D. Eichmann, attorney at KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3007.244s">So</a>  it sounds like fundamentally the dispute is over the roadbed of Main Street and the city engineer and our council have made it clear that the median on Main Street is above the foundation of the roadbed and therefore curb to curb does not mean curb to median curb, but one curb to the other side because the roadbed is continuous under the median. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3030.617s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Radzig]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3032.198s">For</a>  whatever reason that might have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3035.3s">That</a>  seems to be, yeah, the sticking point. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3039.223s">Our</a>  original intention for restoration when we talked about Curve the Curb at the original petition hearing was median curb, which we felt was reasonable restoration for the approximately two foot wide trench that we proposed to dig along the edge of road curb on the west edge of Main Street in that section.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3064.232s">Okay,</a>  Vice President Collins and Councilor Lazzaro, Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3068.834s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3070.014s">Thank</a>  you for being present to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3071.594s">Thank</a>  you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3073.355s">I'm</a>  feeling a little confused about what's changed since, well, I'm not confused about what's changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3080.777s">I'm</a>  a bit confused about why there's been a change since the agreement that the council and the city department came to. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3089.298s">With</a>  National Grid last fall, I think that you know we had a essentially a contract between the city and National Grid stating the agreement curb to curb and stating these conditions that there would be an equivalent square footage or whatever the proper terminology is in this case that would be restored on <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3110.417s">adjacent</a>  seats close to the affected area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3112.779s">Those</a>  are the stipulations that this council added to the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3121.527s">And</a>  we've had that in place since November. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3123.869s">So</a>  I admit I'm a little surprised to hear that characterized as a non-starter now, many months later. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3134.625s">To</a>  be honest, I still think that the stipulations are very reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3138.751s">I'm</a>  a little surprised to hear the notion of this affecting utility rates for Medford ratepayers because we know that rates are not set on a <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3151.167s">granular</a>  city by city basis like that so that strikes me as a surprising thing to hear put forward in a public meeting I don't think that we should be making a decision based on that because we know that's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3162.401s">And</a>  if I recall correctly from our discussions about this last term. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3169.387s">Part</a>  of the context around this conversation is National Grid did work in a similar area of Long Main Street quite recently, within five years, so this is asking the Butters to, you know, of course it's all for good reason, but it's asking the Butters to go through that inconvenience, again, in a relatively short timeline, and I think that's why it's important to make sure that if the Butters are to be put through that, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3196.084s">that,</a>  you know, we get back an appropriate public benefit in the term of that curb-to-curb restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3203.588s">And</a>  as long as there's work being done, you know, disrupting traffic and neighbors in the area, I think it's appropriate to stick with the original stipulation that we have equivalent square footage restoration in those other areas that the Council stipulated back in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3219.457s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3227.2s">Vice</a>  President Collins stole some of my things that I was going to say, but thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3231.482s">That</a>  was very concise and well put. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3234.763s">One</a>  thing I did want to mention was that this is an amendment to a previously approved contract, as Vice President Collins mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3243.568s">So</a>  this was something that was already agreed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3247.324s">We've,</a>  we've said many times curb to curb being the industry standard so nobody ever says median. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3253.908s">And</a>  I can also say I have, I live on a street that had work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3258.05s">I</a>  think it was before the past five years, and there was a <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3263.352s">gas</a>  line that was replaced by National Grid under my street, and only half of our street was paved, which means there's a seam in the middle of the street, which means that there is already deterioration in the center of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3279.292s">That's</a>  why it's important that we carry on the paving from one end of the street to the other end of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3285.673s">Main</a>  street being an extremely busy road, that intersection being complicated to drive through as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3291.794s">We</a>  have the police station, we have a fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3295.355s">It's</a>  very busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3296.195s">I</a>  wouldn't want to put our residents in any kind of situation where they would be facing any more complicated or dangerous scenarios at that intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3308.607s">So</a>  I think it's pretty clear to me that this is not something I would want to risk safety or cost in the future, but I appreciate the opportunity to look into it more in depth. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3321.91s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3323.51s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3324.97s">Just</a>  a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3327.371s">We'll</a>  go to attorney, we'll go to Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3330.451s">You</a>  can tell it's been a month since I've done this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3332.592s">Councilor</a>  Callahan and Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3335.868s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3337.209s">I</a>  wanted to mention that I did knock on thousands of doors last summer and fall, and this issue came up really a surprising number of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3347.335s">How</a>  many residents commented that within the first few years after completely repaving a street, that some project would come in and rip up the street again, and that they felt that that was a poor use of city funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3363.704s">So</a>  I think this is important that we, as a city, require full repaving of city streets when it is within five years of the paving of a street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3378.208s">I'm</a>  sure that it is within the business model of National Grid to fully repave roads that have been from curb to curb that have been paved within the last five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3391.109s">simply</a>  because that is just a normal process of doing business, doing the kind of business that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3396.974s">It</a>  may also be something that you realize that when a city council has changed personnel, that perhaps you might get a different opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3407.823s">And</a>  that may be your job, but my job is to fight for what the city should be getting in this business contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3416.61s">And</a>  within this business contract, it is, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3420.965s">The</a>  normal thing, the thing that we need to request is that you do full curb-to-curb repaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3426.207s">And</a>  if the agreement was made in the past, that it makes more sense for both parties for that to be moved to a different street, but that the cost of the repaving is fully reimbursed by National Grid, then I feel very comfortable with that agreement that was made in November.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3450.321s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3450.962s">I</a>  echo my council colleagues frustration with the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3456.604s">I</a>  think Councilor Callaghan put it really well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3458.725s">I</a>  hear this a lot from our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3461.066s">You</a>  know, having read through the two memos from the attorneys, having read through the cases cited and the statutes at hand, I think I would recommend to the Council that we table this matter, that we seek a meeting with legal representation just <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3478.493s">to</a>  do our due diligence to figure out what these cases mean, what precedents they hold for us, and what rules we're bound to. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3491.826s">And</a>  I would put that in the form of a motion.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3496.951s">A</a>  motion to table is undebatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3500.754s">Is</a>  it about the motion itself? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3503.177s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3504.813s">And</a>  technically we can't actually table, it's not gonna be a motion to continue the public hearing to a date certain, which is debatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3509.737s">It's</a>  not a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3512.559s">It's</a>  an amendment to grant allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3515.041s">Nevermind,</a>  so we can table it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3518.443s">What's</a>  your question?</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3520.124s">If</a>  we table this amendment, does it delay the work that is scheduled, any work that is scheduled or anything that needs to- I don't know, but that's-</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3532.19s">Okay,</a>  there's a delay to the work.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3534.511s">Is</a>  there work currently scheduled?</p>

    <p>[Radzig]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3535.912s">Yeah,</a>  is there work scheduled? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3537.993s">We've</a>  been attempting to do the work, I'd say for a year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3543.256s">We've</a>  been working through many steps to get to the point where we can go in and get an approved road opening permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3551.301s">And</a>  we haven't been able to do that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3553.162s">This</a>  is one of the last items to clear up.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3557.611s">Okay,</a>  I do have questions myself and haven't had the chance to ask them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3567.076s">I</a>  just think since the rate payers were brought up, do you know what the annual profit was of the Massachusetts Electric Company last year?</p>

    <p>[Radzig]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3572.94s">I</a>  don't, no.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3574.861s">It</a>  was $104 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3575.441s">The</a>  year before that it was 120, year before that 122. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3577.382s">Your</a>  parent company in the UK? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3583.502s">Annual</a>  profits, 7.97 billion. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3586.824s">So</a>  I think the assertion of returning this to the rate payers is indicative of the failure of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to structure our public utility system in a way that is beneficial to the public, and not in a way that pads the profits of very large corporations, which aren't even headquartered in this country, nevermind the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3608.166s">Is</a>  your motion to table? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3609.506s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3610.787s">On</a>  the motion to table of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3614.808s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3617.989s">Sure,</a>  we have a letter from legal.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3619.85s">I</a>  don't.</p>
