 <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=759.145s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Committee on Public Health and Community Safety meet with the Health Director to consider updates to the Road and Control Ordinance, Chapter 6, Article 4. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=766.01s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=768.472s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=772.609s">So</a>  I've been in conversation with, among other people within City Hall, our Board of Health Director, Health Director, Director O'Connor, about some amendments to the rodent control ordinance that she and her team are seeing on their side that they believe could help them better implement best practices and rules for residents and businesses to be part of our multi-pronged approach at mitigating <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=798.815s">the</a>  growing rodent population in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=801.237s">They've</a>  identified some changes that we could make within the text of the ordinance that would give them more latitude to enforce, such as how trash receptacles are placed and maintained on property. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=812.163s">I've</a>  talked to a lot of people in the city and outside about this, and they say one of the problems that we're running into is just that we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=820.888s">keep</a>  it tighter when it comes to how trash and recycling and things that attract rodents, how those are stowed around residential and business areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=830.114s">So</a>  they've identified some changes in the ordinance that they would like for the council to consider that will just make enforcement easier on their side. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=838.98s">We're</a>  considering a committee meeting date for next week just to get the ball moving on that quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=844.144s">And</a>  at the same time, I believe we're also going to consider a paper that's already before the council, an overgrowth ordinance, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=851.388s">which</a>  will have some same hopeful goals of giving the city more tools to where we see those problem areas in the city that are places where rodents are congregating, where the threat population is concentrated, give the city more tools to do enforcement around making sure those are cleaned up so that we're not harboring rodents where we don't need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=874.863s">So</a>  I would motion to move this to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1006.248s">So</a>  there's no conflict.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1016.88s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1018.241s">Next,</a>  we'll go to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1019.743s">First,</a>  we have a petition paper from Cindy Watson. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1023.527s">I</a>  will read it while we welcome Cindy to the stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1025.909s">To</a>  the Honorable City Council of Councilors, the undersigned respectfully pray for support from the City Councilors in recognizing the importance of the Chevalier Theatre. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1033.416s">The</a>  Chevalier is the economic engine for the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1035.799s">Cindy</a>  Watson, 65 Valley Street, 4D, Medford, MA. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1040.624s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1072.235s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1072.995s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1077.157s">Pardon</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1079.097s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1080.278s">I've</a>  come before the City Council many, many times, pre and post Bill Blumenreich presents, and I'll also tell you that I wear my hat on my sleeve, I got a fire in my soul, and sometimes a mouth I can't control, so I'll try to be good during this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1096.641s">As</a>  many of you know, Bill Boomerite took over about five years ago, he just renewed his contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1102.847s">He</a>  is the absolute economic engine for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1106.23s">When</a>  he has a show, businesses are booming. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1110.194s">I</a>  can't tell you how many business owners have come up to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1112.856s">It's</a>  sad that Salvatore's is still vacant. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1117.417s">But</a>  there is a lack of support from the city in all areas, whether it be the city council, school committee, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1127.346s">Had</a>  this meeting, discussions with the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1130.289s">We</a>  just celebrated our 30th anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1133.286s">And</a>  for the life of me, I can't understand why there's not more participation from everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1138.989s">So</a>  I'm here to sort of embrace all of you to get you to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1144.052s">And</a>  I also want to give a couple of highlights that we've done over the last 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1148.735s">And</a>  I want to reiterate that I'm here on behalf of the friends in the Jean Mack Auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1155.498s">Folks</a>  probably don't know that we do a lot, a lot of work for underprivileged children. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1160.768s">through</a>  the former Boys and Girls Club, which is now overseen by the Mystic Y. So again, just so that you can see, all of this came from volunteers, 30 years, half of them are still on the board, doing an incredible amount of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1183.892s">And</a>  again, I'm just gonna give you a brief synopsis. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1187.273s">We've</a>  raised more than $1.4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1191.22s">for</a>  the Gene Mack Gym Recreation Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1196.902s">We</a>  have a tremendous grant writer on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1200.463s">He's</a>  been responsible for spearheading grants that have brought in $500,000 to install air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1210.466s">This</a>  is all volunteer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1211.567s">$88,000</a>  to restore 19 original broken windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1220.377s">$90,000</a>  to restore, I'm sure everybody's seen it, it was an eyesore going down Forest Street, the Chevalier facade. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1228.843s">We're</a>  fortunate to have State Representative Paul Donato on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1234.087s">He</a>  brings in probably through now various governors $100,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1241.392s">People</a>  may or may not know that each ticket that's sold at the Chevalier that Bill has a show <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1249.676s">Sometimes</a>  you can have two or three shows a week, 1,900 seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1253.8s">Let's</a>  take two shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1256.683s">That's</a>  $300 that goes back to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1260.847s">So</a>  again, I could go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1265.051s">But</a>  just for whatever reason, it seems to be a dearth. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1269.395s">of</a>  just participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1271.115s">So</a>  the former city councilors, and maybe a lot of you folks, I don't know as well as the others, but we had a city council that was on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1280.718s">We</a>  had folks that came to our annual meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1284.358s">We</a>  had folks that were very, very enthusiastic about supporting the Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1291.58s">So</a>  I'm here tonight to try to work collaboratively with all of you to help our efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1297.537s">I</a>  mean, I don't see people when we're down at various events in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1302.603s">So</a>  again, it's very frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1305.446s">You</a>  know, we want to work with you to reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1310.748s">We've,</a>  Bill has been unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1313.489s">He's</a>  very philanthropic when he hasn't sold a show out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1317.89s">He'll</a>  give tickets, extra tickets to folks over the senior center, people who are economically advantaged, don't have an opportunity to go to a show. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1327.953s">He</a>  calls me or some of the other board members and will say, listen, he just, there was a show last Saturday, gave 20 seats away. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1338.919s">people</a>  in the city of Medford would never have the opportunity to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1345.165s">We've</a>  also transpired the youth center, as I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1350.229s">These</a>  are kids, again, from diverse backgrounds, have never had the opportunities for educational devices, which we help support. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1358.016s">So</a>  when people think of the Friends of Chevalier, they just think, oh, well, they're working with a theater, but we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1363.321s">It's</a>  a sort of a huge collaborative effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1367.128s">So</a>  I'm asking you to sort of, if you can make more of a presence in the community, maybe start October 24th, come to the annual meeting, maybe become a member. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1378.534s">It's</a>  only $20. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1379.075s">We</a>  are revamping our membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1382.537s">I</a>  mean, I'll admit it needs some work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1385.098s">Maybe</a>  a tiered system that become a member for $100, you'll get a free theater ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1391.172s">But</a>  somehow the city has to recognize the strength of the Chevalier Theater, the board, and all that Bill Blumenreich does. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1402.622s">So</a>  I'm happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1407.706s">To</a>  assist anybody that wants to help us, we meet once a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1412.37s">Like</a>  I said, some of these folks, we've got a 94-year-old woman who's on the board for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1419.281s">May</a>  mark your birth, people probably know us, Citizen of the Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1423.064s">Like</a>  I said, Paul Donato, Ken Crouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1425.826s">I</a>  mean, I can't say enough about the sport. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1428.448s">So</a>  I can recognize him because I'm with him once a month, but I think the city again has to acknowledge the work that the Friends of Chevalier does.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1439.537s">Thank</a>  you, Cindy. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1440.618s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1442.559s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1445.191s">First</a>  and foremost, I do want to thank you for your work.</p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1448.392s">Well,</a>  it's not just me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1449.532s">It's</a>  a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1450.533s">I</a>  know, I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1451.153s">I</a>  was going to get there.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1453.734s">I</a>  was going to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1454.874s">The</a>  friends of the Chevalier and Gene Matcham, I think really do do a lot of work for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1460.556s">I've</a>  been lucky enough to be on the Community Fund Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1464.577s">where</a>  we see the applications from you guys trying to help, you know, we have a limited pot of money with that fund, but, you know, the mayor and I, in particular, advocated to try to make sure you guys got some money there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1478.008s">There's</a>  so much more that needs to be done, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1480.39s">You</a>  see, I mean, really the application, there's <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1484.313s">so</a>  much more that our city could be helping with and funds that we need to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1491.839s">I</a>  think it'd be helpful if we put a resolution on the next agenda, thanking the friends of the Chevalier and GMAC, Jim, for all the work that you've done over the last few decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1502.885s">I,</a>  you mentioned the membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1504.666s">I</a>  was, I was, I was, I was thinking about, you know, just asking everyone in the room here to sign up for a membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1512.75s">I</a>  know you were very persistent with me to remind me to make sure that I signed up for it and I did sign up for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1518.732s">Ken</a>  Kraus and I talk a lot whenever we see each other about what the theater needs and what the square needs in regards to the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1527.516s">the</a>  gym and its deeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1529.797s">I</a>  really enjoyed, I really, I think, value that you brought up the gym as well, because I think people forget about the value of that gym. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1537.242s">But</a>  I remember when I was young, I went, I did programs there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1541.184s">There</a>  are so many, so many of my friends, little brothers and sisters do programs there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1549.281s">I</a>  think I lament if the invitations to us to the annual meetings have slipped through the cracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1555.667s">I</a>  know we all get a lot of invitations as councillors, and I just wanted to ask through the chair if you could send us that invitation to the annual meeting again, just to make sure we all have it in our inboxes as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1569.804s">but</a>  I am grateful for the work that you all do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1572.906s">And</a>  I know it's not just you, and I know it's not just Ken, it's many people pulling the operation together. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1579.191s">And</a>  I appreciate you coming here tonight to keep us accountable and keep us on our toes.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1588.838s">I</a>  think that's what you're saying, Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1594.735s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1595.155s">Thank</a>  you so much for coming tonight I really appreciate it, especially knowing that there is a another even more star studded event that you could have been at tonight thank you so much for coming and speaking to us and, you know, continuing to raise the profile of Australia and in addition to all the work that you and the rest of the board is doing every week and every month we really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1615.598s">And</a>  I appreciate the, you know, kind of the reminder the call to action of how much this team is doing behind the scenes week in and week out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1625.203s">I</a>  know as a Councilor, one thing that I'm that I think we're always keeping an eye on kind of on an annual basis is making sure that the casino mitigation funds I know that there's a portion of that that's earmarked for the Chevalier, we want to make sure that that <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1637.188s">remains</a>  because it's so important for this very uniquely Medford institution to be able to stay important, stay special, and stay competitive when these like very large corporate venues such as Encore do come into the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1651.774s">In</a>  addition, I've always really valued getting those like snapshots of progress and whenever the Chevalier comes forward with the CPA application, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1660.774s">It's</a>  always like this incredible pamphlet of what's been going on and how much more there is to do, whether it's restoring the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1667.341s">I</a>  know there was a big organ restoration project that was wrapped up the past couple years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1671.967s">Anyway,</a>  I know that's just really scratching the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how much is going on behind those doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1677.679s">every</a>  year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1679.339s">So</a>  thank you for, you know, platforming the membership drive, the annual meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1683.8s">I</a>  would love to get more involved and get a little bit more into the details about what you all are working on all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1690.262s">I</a>  think as Councilors, and especially as, you know, as residents, whenever the Chevalier is bringing in, you know, another great act every weekend, you see the cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1698.763s">I</a>  know there's so often that I'm like walking down Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1701.424s">I'm</a>  like, wow, they got that person? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1703.184s">Amazing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1703.904s">What</a>  a pull. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1705.725s">So</a>  it's visible. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1707.782s">what</a>  an incredible theater this is here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1709.843s">And,</a>  you know, it shouldn't go without saying how much work goes into keeping it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1713.884s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1715.105s">It's</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1715.705s">We</a>  had to fight like hell to, you know, fought off Wynn at the Everett Casino because they were a huge threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1724.868s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1725.768s">And</a>  we worked very, very hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1727.789s">You</a>  know, we were some elite folks in addition to others, but it was, it was close.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1736.792s">Cindy,</a>  thank you so much for coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1739.153s">I</a>  just want to thank you and the friends for all the work that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1742.634s">You</a>  know, whenever we see a CPA application or community fund or whatever it might be, I know we want to support the Chevalier as much as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1748.936s">And</a>  supporting the friends is a key part of that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1752.677s">and</a>  the organ society and all the other folks who have done so much for the for the building, you know, I'm on the Brooks estate board. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1759.243s">So</a>  I kind of understand firsthand a little bit what it feels like sometimes when you're trying to raise money for the city owned property, and then the city is not pitching in services and resources that are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1771.093s">You</a>  know, I am an advocate of trying to put more of the city's funds into supporting Chevalier directly, I know that there's a very <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1777.979s">very</a>  small amount of money that's going to support Chevalier right now from the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1783.442s">And</a>  I think that's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1785.483s">So</a>  thank you for coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1786.804s">And</a>  I do want to just ask, not just for us, but to share with anyone who may be watching, what's the best way that folks can join as a member? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1793.927s">Is</a>  there a website to go to? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1795.728s">And</a>  what's the best way to sign up for the annual meeting?</p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1799.41s">You</a>  can let me know, because it will be at the condo that I live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1802.712s">So</a>  it's the association room. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1808.703s">So</a>  I'm assuming that everybody will be there on the 24th?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1812.945s">I</a>  can't promise everybody, but sure, some of us will attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1817.787s">But</a>  if the public wants to attend, how can they find out more and sign up?</p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1822.29s">There's</a>  plenty of info on the website, and we do send out a membership drive a month prior to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1827.792s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1828.392s">Approximately.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1830.173s">And</a>  is it friends, what's the URL? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1835.111s">friendsofthechevalier.com?</a> </p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1836.371s">Yes,</a>  that's actually another website, Zach, that we're revamping. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1839.953s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1840.293s">So</a>  that should be up and running within a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1842.294s">There</a>  was some problems, some issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1845.034s">But</a>  you can go on, you know, the computer, just look under other friends and you'll, there's ample information.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1850.196s">Great,</a>  thank you so much, Cindy.</p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1851.617s">All</a>  right, thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Amante]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2181.462s">I</a>  think overall, this business has been increasing more towards the late night, especially on the Friday, Saturday, Sunday area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2188.854s">So</a>  we do see the higher volume on those days. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2193.641s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

President Bears?, the reading in favor of summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2257.451s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2259.092s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2259.472s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2260.993s">There</a>  is a request from National Grid to the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2264.594s">There's</a>  a petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2266.055s">There's</a>  a grant location application that was previously approved, and this is a request for amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2270.498s">We've</a>  received communications from KP Law and City Engineer Wartella. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2274.64s">The</a>  folks that want, I could read them, but, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2284.599s">Do</a>  we have a synopsis from the engineer? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2288.121s">Sure,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2289.001s">Do</a>  we have a brief synopsis of the request?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2291.183s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Radzig]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2297.226s">I'm</a>  Chris Radzig from the National Grid District Design Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2300.988s">And</a>  online, we have Mark Riley, the Assistant General Counsel for National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2307.272s">We're</a>  here to speak on the amendment request for a grant of location previously <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2314.011s">approved</a>  by the Council last November. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2321.357s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2322.958s">Yes,</a>  we can hear you.</p>

    <p>[Rielly]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2334.861s">Yeah,</a>  a brief background might be helpful, um, because it's been a while since November, since the city last saw this petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2342.325s">Uh,</a>  it was a petition that, uh, which was granted to install underground electrical conduit on main street, um, close to the intersection of South street and then about 370 feet Southward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2355.412s">Um,</a>  the company had met with Mr. Wartell and others to regarding the project and, um, had <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2362.662s">come</a>  to what we thought was an agreement about street restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2366.784s">And</a>  then that was reflected on a civil drawing that Chris has and can hand out, because I think it was erroneously left off when we filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2378.251s">It</a>  was supposed to be attached to the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2382.233s">During</a>  the hearing, the city council hearing, an additional condition was added that required the company to repair other streets that weren't affected by the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2392.882s">Um,</a>  and then that, and then in addition, subsequent to the hearing and further conversations with, um, Mr. Wartell, it became clear that we didn't quite agree on certain aspects of the restoration in particular, what was meant by curb to curb repaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2408.688s">So,</a>  um, we're here to sort of remedy that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2413.41s">Um,</a>  and the, the specifics of the requests are in the letter, but in some, um, we. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2422.085s">Our</a>  proposal is to amend the condition to remove the requirement to repair or repave irrelevant streets, and then to allow us to either restore Main Street curb to median curb, or to pay the SPOF per section 74-1442B. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2441.672s">And</a>  I can get into the explanation of <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2449.733s">our</a>  objections to restoring streets that aren't being disturbed, if you'd like, but I'll pause there.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2459.497s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2459.897s">And</a>  if I remember correctly, if I may, just that what we had requested was that if there was a certain amount of pavement that was not going to be restored, that it be <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2470.578s">the</a>  restore other pavement in lieu of restoring that pavement. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2472.999s">I</a>  believe that was the condition so that the square footage of pavement would, that would be the same that was restored or saying no.</p>

    <p>[Radzig]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2480.184s">That</a>  was the general gist of yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2483.145s">The</a>  requirements.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2484.246s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2484.606s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2484.946s">I</a>  welcome his hard work.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2500.242s">that</a>  the biggest issues we have is that when they do open the streets, not just, not your company, but we're seeing too many, too many jobs that are left half done, and it's creating more havoc when people leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2516.334s">And</a>  I think the biggest piece is having a curb-to-curb process. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2521.939s">That's</a>  something that, to me, as one councilor, is a non-negotiable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2527.003s">But</a>  from what I, just for clarification, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2531.397s">Are</a>  we saying that the roads that we're requesting, they will be paved curb to curb, but we're asking for other streets that are impacted to be repaved? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2546.742s">I</a>  just need some clarification on that.</p>

    <p>[Rielly]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2550.003s">Yeah,</a>  I think there's sort of two issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2555.045s">There</a>  was a curb to curb, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2558.294s">What</a>  grid understood at the hearing and in earlier discussions with the city engineer was that curb to curb meant that we would restore curb to the median curb, you know, the next nearest curb, which was the median strip. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2578.704s">The</a>  city engineer is taking the position that it should be curb to the, across the median to the other side of Main Street, which we're not touching. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2588.727s">Um,</a>  and it, it exceeds any disturbed area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2592.73s">Um,</a>  we're willing to, to restore for the, for the length of our trench. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2600.316s">We're</a>  willing to restore main street curb to median curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2604.339s">Um,</a>  so there was that dispute about what curb to curb meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2609.283s">The</a>  second piece was that, um, you know, having to repair roads that we weren't touching at all that weren't main street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2618.573s">Um,</a>  and that's, you know, if, if nothing else happens today, that that has to come off, that's just a non-starter because as you can imagine, you know, grid is always kind of in the position of having to navigate requests from municipalities across our service territory. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2637.945s">And</a>  if, if, whether it's Medford or someone else is asking us to repair <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2643.345s">different</a>  roads and we're disturbing, that's going to increase costs tremendously to everyone's detriment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2650.387s">So</a>  we have to be a gatekeeper on that type of thing.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2659.15s">Okay,</a>  Mr. President, if I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2661.671s">Sure,</a>  I just wanna, go ahead, Councilor Scarpelli, then we'll go to Vice President Collins and Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2667.072s">I</a>  can also read the letter from council to the city.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2669.633s">Okay,</a>  I too am a little leery of, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2673.484s">of</a>  the impact that this will make not only for the increased costs that would be then put on our ratepayers within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2685.083s">I</a>  know that because National Grid's not going to <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2687.369s">We're</a>  not going to take it on the chin, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2688.95s">I</a>  mean, it's going to be passed off somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2691.591s">But</a>  as I'm looking at it online, where we're looking at South Street and traversing down Main Street, I know exactly what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2701.836s">That</a>  median was already developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2704.097s">That</a>  was in front of the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2707.179s">Is</a>  that where?</p>

    <p>[Radzig]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2707.819s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2708.219s">So</a>  that's already been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2711.713s">Yeah,</a>  I could see your apprehension with that going across the street of the medium, because if I can ask the city engineer in this map and taking this route, even today, I didn't see, it didn't seem to be uneven or really damaged in that area on the other side of the medium anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2741.323s">where</a>  we're seeing the work being done down South Street and all the way down Main Street, that is a no brainer of curb to curb, but that's something that I'd have to consider now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2754.995s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2757.116s">I</a>  could read the letter from Council if that would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2759.558s">I</a>  just wanted to get that summary out there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2765.062s">Dear</a>  Attorney Riley, thank you for your letter made 29th address to the City Engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2769.826s">The</a>  City of Medford has asked us to respond as Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2771.928s">We</a>  have consulted with City Engineer, Director of Public Works and the Mayor in making this response. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2776.351s">then</a>  location as you know this matter concerns the proper interpretation of that certain grant of location 23445 issued by the city council on November 14 2023 approving national bridge petition to construct a line of electric underground electric conduits in main street at the location specified <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2791.348s">The</a>  installation requires cutting and excavating a trench in the Main Street pavement for a length of approximately 370 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2795.372s">Main</a>  Street in this location was fully reconstructed less than five years ago and contains a median strip separating opposing lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2803.378s">This</a>  median strip is laid on top of the pavement bed, extending as a unbroken hall from the curb on one side of the roadway to the curb on the far side. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2811.025s">As</a>  a condition of the grant of location, the City Council required National Grid to provide repaving of another roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2816.87s">equal</a>  to the work associated with curb-to-curb roadway restoration within the limits of the Main Street project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2822.135s">Curb-to-curb</a>  is an industry standard term referring to the full width of the roadway, and the restoration condition must be interpreted as such. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2828.381s">The</a>  Council is familiar with the roadway in question, and if the Council's intent was to limit restoration limits to curb-to-median curb, it could have so specified. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2837.369s">Please</a>  further note that Main Street is not a quote divided road. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2840.352s">That</a>  term is used specifically in the industry for highways and state routes with a large median frequently unpaved and northbound southbound designations. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2847.18s">Main</a>  Street is not designated that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2849.683s">Restoration</a>  standard, the city readily acknowledges the authority of the Commonwealth to regulate the placement of utility lines in the city streets and with the application order DTE 98-22. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2859.213s">entitled</a>  standards to be employed by public utility operators when restoring any of the streets, lanes, and highways and municipalities as an extension of that authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2866.355s">In</a>  particular, section nine of the order sets forth the standards for pavement restoration following disturbance by utility. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2872.518s">Section</a>  9.1 provides that quote, all pavement disturbed by the work, unquote, shall be replaced with quote, homogeneous and in-kind pavement to the original strength and condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2881.461s">Quote,</a>  homogeneous is defined as of uniform structure or composition throughout. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2885.842s">Sections</a>  9.2 through 9.15, 9.15 set forth particular standards relative to pavement restoration without regard to the age of the roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2896.492s">Section</a>  9.16, however, provides that the municipality quote, shall have a jurisdiction to determine the pavement repair method <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2902.617s">to</a>  be utilized on all pavements which have been installed for less than five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2906.379s">Pursuant</a>  to the grant location, the City of Medford has determined that the work proposed in Main Street, a street reconstructed within the past five years, requires curb-to-curb restoration within the project limits or its equivalent. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2916.765s">As</a>  set forth in Section 9.16, quote, method is simply the procedure for accomplishing the task, and a curb-to-curb restoration is the method the City has reasonably selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2926.671s">pursuant</a>  to section 9.16 of the order to restore Main Street to its original strength and condition, the structural integrity and life of a paved street as a whole is compromised by partial exclamations and patches, and such compromises can be avoided by curb-to-curb reconstruction to maintain the structural integrity of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2942.442s">The</a>  case, Colonial Gloss versus Town of Wilmington, cited by National Register for its interpretation of pavement with restoration requirements does not concern the disturbance of city streets reconstructed within the past five years, and thus does not apply to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2955.231s">The</a>  timing of restoration work, the terms and conditions for work in public streets allowed by a grant of location are determined by the appropriate permanent authority as designated by section 74-141 of the city ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2965.597s">In</a>  this case, the permitting authority for the Main Street project as approved and conditioned by the city council is the engineering division of the Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2973.082s">As</a>  you are aware, National Grid attempted to bypass the permitting process by contacting the DPW commissioner directly after meeting with the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2980.086s">Requiring</a>  the restoration work prior to commencing the Main Street project is essential to the city to ensure that the required work is satisfactorily completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2987.149s">National</a>  Grid has repeatedly not completed promised work, one still being from 2019, and therefore the permit authority engineering is conditioning the permit for the Main Street project accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2997.613s">Thank</a>  you for your attention to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2999.454s">If</a>  you have questions, please do not hesitate to contact me, very truly yours, Jonathan D. Eichmann, attorney at KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3007.244s">So</a>  it sounds like fundamentally the dispute is over the roadbed of Main Street and the city engineer and our council have made it clear that the median on Main Street is above the foundation of the roadbed and therefore curb to curb does not mean curb to median curb, but one curb to the other side because the roadbed is continuous under the median. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3030.617s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Radzig]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3032.198s">For</a>  whatever reason that might have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3035.3s">That</a>  seems to be, yeah, the sticking point. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3039.223s">Our</a>  original intention for restoration when we talked about Curve the Curb at the original petition hearing was median curb, which we felt was reasonable restoration for the approximately two foot wide trench that we proposed to dig along the edge of road curb on the west edge of Main Street in that section.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3064.232s">Okay,</a>  Vice President Collins and Councilor Lazzaro, Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3068.834s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3070.014s">Thank</a>  you for being present to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3071.594s">Thank</a>  you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3073.355s">I'm</a>  feeling a little confused about what's changed since, well, I'm not confused about what's changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3080.777s">I'm</a>  a bit confused about why there's been a change since the agreement that the council and the city department came to. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3089.298s">With</a>  National Grid last fall, I think that you know we had a essentially a contract between the city and National Grid stating the agreement curb to curb and stating these conditions that there would be an equivalent square footage or whatever the proper terminology is in this case that would be restored on <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3110.417s">adjacent</a>  seats close to the affected area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3112.779s">Those</a>  are the stipulations that this council added to the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3121.527s">And</a>  we've had that in place since November. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3123.869s">So</a>  I admit I'm a little surprised to hear that characterized as a non-starter now, many months later. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3134.625s">To</a>  be honest, I still think that the stipulations are very reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3138.751s">I'm</a>  a little surprised to hear the notion of this affecting utility rates for Medford ratepayers because we know that rates are not set on a <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3151.167s">granular</a>  city by city basis like that so that strikes me as a surprising thing to hear put forward in a public meeting I don't think that we should be making a decision based on that because we know that's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3162.401s">And</a>  if I recall correctly from our discussions about this last term. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3169.387s">Part</a>  of the context around this conversation is National Grid did work in a similar area of Long Main Street quite recently, within five years, so this is asking the Butters to, you know, of course it's all for good reason, but it's asking the Butters to go through that inconvenience, again, in a relatively short timeline, and I think that's why it's important to make sure that if the Butters are to be put through that, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3196.084s">that,</a>  you know, we get back an appropriate public benefit in the term of that curb-to-curb restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3203.588s">And</a>  as long as there's work being done, you know, disrupting traffic and neighbors in the area, I think it's appropriate to stick with the original stipulation that we have equivalent square footage restoration in those other areas that the Council stipulated back in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3219.457s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3227.2s">Vice</a>  President Collins stole some of my things that I was going to say, but thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3231.482s">That</a>  was very concise and well put. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3234.763s">One</a>  thing I did want to mention was that this is an amendment to a previously approved contract, as Vice President Collins mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3243.568s">So</a>  this was something that was already agreed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3247.324s">We've,</a>  we've said many times curb to curb being the industry standard so nobody ever says median. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3253.908s">And</a>  I can also say I have, I live on a street that had work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3258.05s">I</a>  think it was before the past five years, and there was a <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3263.352s">gas</a>  line that was replaced by National Grid under my street, and only half of our street was paved, which means there's a seam in the middle of the street, which means that there is already deterioration in the center of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3279.292s">That's</a>  why it's important that we carry on the paving from one end of the street to the other end of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3285.673s">Main</a>  street being an extremely busy road, that intersection being complicated to drive through as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3291.794s">We</a>  have the police station, we have a fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3295.355s">It's</a>  very busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3296.195s">I</a>  wouldn't want to put our residents in any kind of situation where they would be facing any more complicated or dangerous scenarios at that intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3308.607s">So</a>  I think it's pretty clear to me that this is not something I would want to risk safety or cost in the future, but I appreciate the opportunity to look into it more in depth. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3321.91s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3323.51s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3324.97s">Just</a>  a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3327.371s">We'll</a>  go to attorney, we'll go to Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3330.451s">You</a>  can tell it's been a month since I've done this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3332.592s">Councilor</a>  Callahan and Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3335.868s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3337.209s">I</a>  wanted to mention that I did knock on thousands of doors last summer and fall, and this issue came up really a surprising number of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3347.335s">How</a>  many residents commented that within the first few years after completely repaving a street, that some project would come in and rip up the street again, and that they felt that that was a poor use of city funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3363.704s">So</a>  I think this is important that we, as a city, require full repaving of city streets when it is within five years of the paving of a street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3378.208s">I'm</a>  sure that it is within the business model of National Grid to fully repave roads that have been from curb to curb that have been paved within the last five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3391.109s">simply</a>  because that is just a normal process of doing business, doing the kind of business that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3396.974s">It</a>  may also be something that you realize that when a city council has changed personnel, that perhaps you might get a different opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3407.823s">And</a>  that may be your job, but my job is to fight for what the city should be getting in this business contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3416.61s">And</a>  within this business contract, it is, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3420.965s">The</a>  normal thing, the thing that we need to request is that you do full curb-to-curb repaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3426.207s">And</a>  if the agreement was made in the past, that it makes more sense for both parties for that to be moved to a different street, but that the cost of the repaving is fully reimbursed by National Grid, then I feel very comfortable with that agreement that was made in November.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3450.321s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3450.962s">I</a>  echo my council colleagues frustration with the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3456.604s">I</a>  think Councilor Callaghan put it really well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3458.725s">I</a>  hear this a lot from our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3461.066s">You</a>  know, having read through the two memos from the attorneys, having read through the cases cited and the statutes at hand, I think I would recommend to the Council that we table this matter, that we seek a meeting with legal representation just <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3478.493s">to</a>  do our due diligence to figure out what these cases mean, what precedents they hold for us, and what rules we're bound to. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3491.826s">And</a>  I would put that in the form of a motion.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3496.951s">A</a>  motion to table is undebatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3500.754s">Is</a>  it about the motion itself? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3503.177s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3504.813s">And</a>  technically we can't actually table, it's not gonna be a motion to continue the public hearing to a date certain, which is debatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3509.737s">It's</a>  not a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3512.559s">It's</a>  an amendment to grant allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3515.041s">Nevermind,</a>  so we can table it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3518.443s">What's</a>  your question?</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3520.124s">If</a>  we table this amendment, does it delay the work that is scheduled, any work that is scheduled or anything that needs to- I don't know, but that's-</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3532.19s">Okay,</a>  there's a delay to the work.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3534.511s">Is</a>  there work currently scheduled?</p>

    <p>[Radzig]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3535.912s">Yeah,</a>  is there work scheduled? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3537.993s">We've</a>  been attempting to do the work, I'd say for a year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3543.256s">We've</a>  been working through many steps to get to the point where we can go in and get an approved road opening permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3551.301s">And</a>  we haven't been able to do that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3553.162s">This</a>  is one of the last items to clear up.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3557.611s">Okay,</a>  I do have questions myself and haven't had the chance to ask them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3567.076s">I</a>  just think since the rate payers were brought up, do you know what the annual profit was of the Massachusetts Electric Company last year?</p>

    <p>[Radzig]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3572.94s">I</a>  don't, no.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3574.861s">It</a>  was $104 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3575.441s">The</a>  year before that it was 120, year before that 122. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3577.382s">Your</a>  parent company in the UK? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3583.502s">Annual</a>  profits, 7.97 billion. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3586.824s">So</a>  I think the assertion of returning this to the rate payers is indicative of the failure of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to structure our public utility system in a way that is beneficial to the public, and not in a way that pads the profits of very large corporations, which aren't even headquartered in this country, nevermind the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3608.166s">Is</a>  your motion to table? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3609.506s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3610.787s">On</a>  the motion to table of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3614.808s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3617.989s">Sure,</a>  we have a letter from legal.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3619.85s">I</a>  don't.</p>

 <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3777.862s">an</a>  act updating the linkage exaction program in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3780.604s">This</a>  is a request by Councilor Leming pursuant to previous motions passed on updating the linkage fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3787.247s">We</a>  have here two honorable representatives, Christine Barber, Paul Donato, and Sean Garberly, and our honorable Senator Patricia Jalen attached as a home rule petition to update the 1989 act. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3796.112s">that</a>  established Medford's linkage program. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3797.773s">Since</a>  1989, this act has provided a critical source of funds for our police, our parks, our roads and traffic, and our water and sewers. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3804.217s">The</a>  current act requires a new study every three years to update the exact amount of linkage fees, but in practice, since its institution in 1990, Medford has never performed such a study. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3812.881s">Thus,</a>  the exact linkage amounts have not been updated since 34 years ago and have been drastically undervalued by the effects of inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3818.945s">As</a>  the city works to update the linkage fees and add a new source of revenue for affordable housing, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3823.107s">We</a>  find that the original requirement for review every three years was likely to cost prohibitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3826.75s">We</a>  therefore request two updates to the Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3828.751s">The</a>  first extends the period of review from three years to 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3831.953s">This</a>  mandates a more reasonable period in between studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3834.615s">The</a>  second allows for automatic updates to linkage fees in between studies based on an inflation index. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3838.878s">This</a>  would prevent fees from being undervalued over time from inflation and uses the same language that is as that established for the City of Watertown in 2022 Act of the Legislature, Chapter 302 of the Acts of 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3849.605s">We've</a>  enclosed the proposed language of the Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3853.527s">Sincerely,</a>  Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3854.688s">An</a>  act updating the linkage exaction program in the City of Medford, Chapter 488 of the Acts of 1989, an act establishing a linkage exaction program in the City of Medford is hereby updated as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3864.551s">Section</a>  2, Part 5 shall now read, the level of any exaction shall be reviewed at least every 10 years and reset as required based on the recommendation of the Office of Community Development and the Mayor of said City. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3874.714s">In</a>  between reviews, updates to any exaction may be adjusted over time or retroactively based on changes in the consumer price index for all urban consumers compiled by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3885.002s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3886.723s">Thank</a>  you, Council President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3889.625s">So</a>  this is the result of a lot of discussions that I've been having with the Office of Community Development as we try to <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3902.655s">update</a>  the linkage program, the capital improvements program. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3906.978s">So</a>  this is essentially when developers come in to the city, they need to pay fees into certain buckets, which will help to improve the city as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3919.547s">What</a>  we're trying to do with this program is first to update the original amounts that were proposed in 1990 when this was established. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3926.612s">and</a>  we're also trying to add a fifth bucket in addition to the ones already mentioned in the letter for affordable housing to provide a more constant source of revenue to the affordable housing trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3938.659s">We</a>  previously discussed changes to the ordinance at earlier meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3943.962s">The</a>  issue is that <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3945.083s">some</a>  of the changes that we're proposing after legal review, it turns out you would need to go back to the state to actually update those in a couple of ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3955.091s">So</a>  in order to actually do these updates every <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3962.256s">three</a>  years as is required by that ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3966.138s">One</a>  study to do that could cost as much as $150,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3968.7s">And</a>  so doing that every three years is too cost prohibitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3973.702s">Just</a>  performing the nexus study to establish a new bucket entirely for the affordable housing trust would probably cost about $80,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3981.667s">The</a>  planning department has been going around trying to find consultants who are willing to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3988.31s">Medford</a>  has a bit of a unique linkage program. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3991.972s">you</a>  know, they are having trouble finding a consultant for a reasonable price that can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3997.135s">So</a>  what this would do first is it would just extend that to save the city a little bit of money because the full linkage program really wouldn't update that much within a three year period that you would actually need to do that study. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4010.422s">10</a>  years is a more reasonable timeframe to do these. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4014.884s">We've</a>  gone 34 years without doing one. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4018.166s">So</a>  I think getting away from that three year mark is reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4022.547s">And</a>  the second, which is very important, is literally just copied and pasted from a similar program that Watertown did in <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4031.372s">2022,</a>  where instead of just having these linkage prices set and just consistently get undervalued by inflation at the same time, there will be automatic updates from year to year so that the city is not losing money over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4045.643s">And,</a>  you know, the less that we do, if we happen to have, you know, staff or boards who just <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4053.291s">don't</a>  do what they're supposed to do and perform these studies every few years, we would just be losing money over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4060.217s">So</a>  again, it's a fairly simple update, but it does need to go to the state for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4066.923s">So</a>  I would motion to approve this home rule petition and send it to the mayor.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4078.587s">I'm</a>  going to approve the homework petition and send it to the mayor, seconded by Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4084.313s">Any</a>  questions or discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4086.155s">Councilor</a>  Kalia.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4088.698s">I</a>  just want to comment that I'm incredibly thrilled about the work that Council on Learning has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4102.82s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4105.162s">I'm</a>  thrilled about the work that Councilor Leming has done on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4108.385s">As</a>  I hope people understand, this City Council has really taken the funding of this city very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4116.372s">We</a>  have been underfunded for a long time, and the linkage fees are one of the few places where we can actually <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4123.859s">obtain</a>  more funds that does not affect property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4129.904s">So</a>  this is something that I think everyone here should be really excited about. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4133.707s">It</a>  has not been updated in 34 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4135.668s">It</a>  is definitely undervalued. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4137.029s">This</a>  is a way that we are going to bring income into the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4140.572s">And</a>  then these changes that make sure that even if a study is not done regularly, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4147.717s">that</a>  we continue to increase those at the price of inflation is truly a fantastic work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4153.82s">I'm</a>  very excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4155.18s">So</a>  thank you, Councilor Leming, for the work that you're doing.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4157.401s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4158.521s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4159.782s">I</a>  can. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4160.422s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4161.463s">I</a>  thank Councilor Leming to look into this, but I think we need to be very careful. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4166.024s">Neighborhood</a>  communities have looked at <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4170.475s">the</a>  vision of development without a full comprehensive plan, and it's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4175.858s">I</a>  think it has to be looked at, but I think we better be careful in what, in totality, what we're doing in this community when you're looking for development and what we're asking for developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4187.485s">We're</a>  seeing impacts in neighboring communities where they had some similar issues and they thought would be great ideas, and instead what they did is they further pushed developers further away from the communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4199.572s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4200.85s">It</a>  really hurt neighboring communities with the fact that neighboring communities lost millions of dollars because of their processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4208.912s">So</a>  I think this is something that, you know, when Mayor McGlynn put this in place, he had the foresight to look at this and say, this is what we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4219.114s">This</a>  is why they set up a trust for each, how do they put it, that each, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4227.463s">each</a>  stakeholder that within the city that would be impacted, the impacted departments, which would have been, I believe the school department, parks and recreation, DPW, water and sewer.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4240.811s">The</a>  linkage funds are for? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4242.332s">No,</a>  the linkage funds don't go to the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4244.133s">It</a>  listed in the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4246.095s">So,</a>  okay, so this is- Water, sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4252.426s">Yeah,</a>  so it's the police department, parks and rec, roads and traffic, water and sewers.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4257.75s">And</a>  the authorizing legislation also enabled an affordable housing, but that was never established.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4262.273s">Yeah,</a>  the authorizing legislation kind of gave a list of buckets that it could potentially go into, and affordable housing was one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4269.419s">But</a>  when they actually implemented it in 1990, they only chose those four.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4272.961s">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4273.742s">I</a>  stand to say it was road and traffic, road and traffic linkage, parks and recreation linkage, police and fire linkage, water and sewer linkage. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4283.639s">So</a>  I think that the other question people had was this, are we going to be looking at small development of someone who was refurbishing their home or adding an addition? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4292.647s">And</a>  I said, no, it would be for... This wouldn't change what linkage currently applies to. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4298.552s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4298.793s">It</a>  would be with the special... Is it special... <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4303.957s">site</a>  plan review correct okay all right so i just like i said i think that uh understanding the history was important and i think that it does need to be looked at but i think that we should be very careful and you know without a real comprehensive plan that at least i haven't seen in what direction this city's going and <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4324.38s">when</a>  it's growth and development, I think it's a little dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4327.862s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4328.443s">And</a>  I would just note that this change would just provide the authority to the city to update the linkage fees and to have an escalator for inflation costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4338.509s">The</a>  city still needs to conduct a nexus study to actually update the rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4342.872s">But</a>  I think we can all agree that what we assessed as the impact of police and fire roads or parks or streets and roads 34 years ago isn't what it's costing the city today.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4354.52s">Yeah,</a>  this would just allow for, this would just allow those automatic inflation based updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4361.167s">And</a>  so it's a very specific, it's a very specific price index that's stated in the proposed change. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4369.436s">And</a>  this was already done over in Watertown. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4372.419s">So</a>  it is becoming standardized. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4374.401s">neighboring</a>  cities, it would also save the city money by expanding the requirement to actually do these studies from three to 10 years, because these studies are pretty cost intensive.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4387.489s">It</a>  also addresses the Supreme Court decision around, I believe, the rationale for the nexus studies, that if you're assessing impact fees, it has to be based on a rational basis test for having a study. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4399.535s">And</a>  that's part of this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4401.196s">That's</a>  a recent court case. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4403.837s">Council</a>  Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4406.119s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4406.439s">I</a>  appreciate the councilor for bringing this forward for lots of reasons, including we have so many discussions inside these chambers about the pretty vast budgetary needs facing so many of our city departments, including the four that are specifically targeted by linkage. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4423.771s">And</a>  we need to be keeping pace with other communities in adopting and evolving to those best practices for how to have sources of revenue that don't just come from sales tax and property tax because our needs are too great. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4441.371s">We</a>  do have a comprehensive plan, the city of Medford comprehensive plan was put together over the course of several years with a ton of resident feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4449.078s">It</a>  is on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4450.679s">And</a>  there's a lot of really big, beautiful lofty goals for how to evolve the Medford that we love today into the community that we're already striving to become. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4461.029s">And</a>  we know how much funding and resources those goals take to manifest. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4465.252s">And</a>  so, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4467.15s">I</a>  think it's about time that we update this mechanism so that these large developers, the only ones that are targeted by linkage are paying their fair share. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4476.672s">And</a>  that's really all that this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4478.033s">And</a>  I think it's heartening to know that some of this research was based on the city of Watertown, which in recent years, if anybody's gone down Arsenal Street, they've seen a huge development boom, heartening to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4488.795s">And</a>  I lost the second place that I was going with that font. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4500.805s">In</a>  terms of the developer experience, I think that, you know, this creates a highly predictable increase that developers can know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4507.867s">So</a>  I don't have any fears attached to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4509.767s">I'm</a>  really glad that we're doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4510.747s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming, for your leadership on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4512.648s">And</a>  I know that City Hall staff were very helpful in the research as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4517.909s">So</a>  I'll second the motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4519.11s">I'll</a>  second the motion to approve by Councilor Leming, seconded by Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4523.131s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4566.493s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4568.901s">So</a>  this is a... We're at the... <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4572.864s">culmination</a>  of an ordinance project that began last year in 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4577.506s">The</a>  idea for a wildlife feeding ordinance was first brought up to me by constituents who were kind of facing this problem firsthand, which I know many people in the city and other cities face, which is there's the wrong kind of animal on my property. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4594.652s">It's</a>  not a pet. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4596.173s">It's</a>  not domesticated. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4597.173s">I</a>  don't want it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4598.133s">It's</a>  a nuisance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4598.974s">It's</a>  potentially a health hazard. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4602.055s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4602.728s">Part</a>  of the reason that it might be on private property in a residential area in an environment that is not appropriate for humans or for the animal is because there are wildlife attractants out, namely food sources for wildlife. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4618.192s">So</a>  I discussed this matter with our code enforcement officers, with our health director, Director O'Connor. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4626.154s">with</a>  other city hall staff and received a lot of really helpful guidance on how to take a model of wildlife feeding ordinances from other cities and environments such as ours and create a mechanism so that city staff have a way to enforce around only inappropriate and problematic feeding of wildlife, the type of which is drawing wildlife. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4650.555s">animals</a>  that shouldn't be there onto residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4653.438s">What</a>  this is not is an ordinance that says you can't have a bird feeder. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4657.562s">We</a>  specifically say you can have a bird feeder. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4660.745s">The</a>  health director said we should put in language on there to make sure that bird feeders are <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4665.782s">constructed</a>  properly, that they're not just squirrel feeding devices, because that's also a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4671.323s">But</a>  this is not an anti-bird feeding ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4674.124s">This</a>  is not an anti-pet feeding ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4677.865s">The</a>  subcommittee on, or the Committee on Public Health and Community Safety really took its time with this ordinance to make sure that we thought through all the nuances and got the right language with advice from <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4688.228s">legal</a>  counsel on how to make sure that this is targeted, just so that when there is problematic wildlife feeding going on the city has a mechanism to step in first to say, Hey, that's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4701.398s">Please</a>  clean up your act. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4702.779s">And</a>  then if the problem willfully persists to issue a ticket or a fine, and this is all towards the end of making sure that our <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4710.438s">beautiful</a>  private residential spaces in Medford can stay safe for wildlife and also stay enjoyable for the people that live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4719.362s">So</a>  I welcome questions from members of the council, especially those that were not on the committee where this is discussed, but otherwise I would want to thank especially our code enforcement officers, building director and health director, Mary Ann O'Connor, most of all for their guidance and a motion for approval.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4736.317s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Collins to approve first reading, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro, any further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4741.892s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4742.532s">I</a>  just wanted to quickly thank Vice President Collins for her hard work on this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4747.033s">This</a>  is something that our health department has been asking for for a while in response to the rodent problems that we've seen in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4755.975s">I</a>  know we've held many a meeting about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4758.075s">We've</a>  held committee of the whole meetings about it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4762.936s">This</a>  is something that they've mentioned repeatedly as something that we can do as a city council to help tackle that problem, especially with winter coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4771.16s">as</a>  you <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4773.099s">referred</a>  to in subcommittee, in committee, we really paid a lot of attention to how can we make sure that this isn't punishing people for good behavior, for hobbies, for interests, but rather focusing on the public health aspect, on the quality of life aspect of the rodent problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4793.435s">And</a>  I think this ordinance strikes a very good balance with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4796.418s">So</a>  I appreciate the work that you especially have put into it and our city staff have put into this as well.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4805.002s">And</a>  just from the chair, just want to thank Vice President Collins as well between this and the work on the solid waste task force and our solid waste ordinances and the release of the solid waste plan and now focused on again now for our second pass at rodent control after the first pass at rodent control, which is obviously much needed with the wildlife feeding and overgrowth and amendments to the rodent control ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4829.022s">really</a>  from this council and in partnership with the city administration worked hard to put together a comprehensive approach to trying to keep this rodent problem out of our community and try to improve our waste practices and I think you've been essential to that and I really want to thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4844.952s">Obviously,</a>  we have more work to do, and we're doing that with an incredibly limited set of resources and funds, which is really difficult, but trying to maximize what we can do given the limited staffing and limited funding is really impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4858.296s">So</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4860.176s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4861.016s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Collins to approve the first reading, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4869.039s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4869.159s">Schwerk,</a>  please call the roll.</p>

 <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4899.226s">dear</a>  president bears and members of the city council I respectfully request and recommend the city council approve the following amendment to chapter 2 article 5 division 4 of the city's ordinance by adopting the following change the table in section 2-964 authorizing revolving funds shall be amended to include an electric vehicle charging revolving fund as per the enclosed table <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4916.677s">and</a>  close the letter from the Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability, Alicia Hunt, that outlines this request, as well as a memorandum that provides supporting documentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4923.939s">Finally,</a>  I'm enclosing a memorandum by Finance Director Auditor, Bob Dickinson, that provides the necessary certification pursuant to Mass General Law, Chapter 44, Section 53E and a half for establishing a revolving fund in the middle of a fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4936.602s">Climate</a>  Staff Planner, Brenda Pike, will be available to speak to this request and answer any questions that you may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4941.163s">Thank</a>  you for your kind attention to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4942.684s">Sincerely,</a>  Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4945.984s">Brenda,</a>  do you have a presentation or just wanna?</p>

    <p>[Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4948.805s">No,</a>  I just wanted to be available for questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4951.166s">So</a>  Brenda Pike, staff planner, Climate Policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4955.687s">I'm</a>  responsible for managing and for installing and the upkeep of the charging stations that the city owns. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4963.709s">There</a>  are 11 right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4967.05s">And</a>  usage has increased a lot in the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4971.672s">And</a>  so we would just like to set up this revolving fund so that we can use the <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4976.354s">amount</a>  that drivers are paying to use these stations for electricity bills for the stations, more maintenance fees and other operating costs.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4986.757s">Yeah,</a>  I can see here from the charts provided that the kilowatt hours have gone up a lot and there's a projection for this year of doubling again. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4994.659s">And</a>  given that the city right now is not charging at all, right, it's a <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4999.68s">It's</a>  $0.25 right now and this would take us up to $0.35. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5002.881s">All</a>  right, I will go to Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5008.322s">I'm</a>  just curious if you have any predictions that if you raise it from $0.25 to $0.35, which based on your chart is one of the higher, is a little bit higher than surrounding cities, do you think that that will lead to fewer people charging in Medford or</p>

    <p>[Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5024.574s">I</a>  don't anticipate that based on studies that I've seen showing that electric vehicle drivers tend to be inelastic in their choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5038.665s">And</a>  there is always the option to charge at home, both with level one chargers or level two chargers that they have installed themselves.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5049.193s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5051.101s">Thank</a>  you so much for coming here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5052.183s">I'm</a>  really excited about the program in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5054.867s">I'm</a>  happy to see that there has been increasing demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5058.092s">So</a>  I think that's a good sign.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5064.685s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5065.526s">Thank</a>  you very much for all your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5066.826s">I</a>  think these are the revenue generating projects that we're talking about and that the city can really use. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5076.851s">And</a>  like we said, we're starting with one. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5079.773s">And</a>  as we see it starting to increase, I think it'll be important that we stay ahead of the kilowatt rate for the fact that we're seeing national grid never saw us <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5093.629s">They're</a>  climbing at an outrageous rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5096.311s">So</a>  in making sure that we're competitive, but at the same time, we're offering something for convenience for our residents and <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5108.134s">To</a>  be honest with you, I'm sure the gaps that people that are driving down 93 that need a charge, the nearest site comes right into Medford, right off the highway, and they use our station. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5119.877s">So</a>  I wouldn't mind that someone from a different community, a different state that needs to be charged, they come into Medford and help us with our bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5128.199s">So</a>  thank you so much.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5129.859s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli, Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5272.183s">Thank</a>  you, Brenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5274.642s">All</a>  right, <a href="../resolutions/24-460.pdf"><font color="green">24-460</font></a> offered, submitted by Mayor Brian O'Connor, refunding loan order request. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5280.949s">We</a>  have a prematurely thank you, Bob. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5283.271s">Sorry</a>  about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5286.107s">We</a>  have here, dear President Bears and members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following loan order. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5293.532s">City</a>  of Medford loan order water bonds, be it ordered that in order to reduce interest costs, the treasurer with the approval of the mayor is authorized to provide for the sale and issuance of refunding bonds pursuant to chapter 44, section 21A of the general laws or pursuant to any other enabling authority at one time or from time to time to refund any or all portions of the city's general obligation bonds outstanding <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5311.884s">as</a>  of the date of adoption of this order, and that the proceeds of the refunding bonds issued pursuant to this order shall be used to pay the principal redemption premium and interest on the bonds of the city to be refunded, and cost of issuance of the refunding bonds, and that the treasurer is authorized to execute such documents as may be necessary or desirable to carry out this transaction, including one or more refunding trust agreements with a bank or trust company, and further order that the treasurer is authorized to file an application <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5336.722s">with</a>  the appropriate officials of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Commonwealth to qualify under Chapter 44A of the general laws, any and all bonds of the city authorized to be borrowed pursuant to this loan order, and to provide such information and execute such documents as such officials of the Commonwealth may require in connection therewith, Finance Director Auditor Bob Dickinson will be prepared, present to answer questions on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5356.688s">We</a>  respectfully submit it to the Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5359.709s">We</a>  also have <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5362.05s">in</a>  accordance with the provisions of Medford City Council Rule 30 from KP Law, we have examined the above captioned loan order as to its legality and respectfully transmit this letter of notification of our findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5373.484s">In</a>  opinion, the loan order in which an authorization is sought to refund any or all portion of the city's outstanding general obligation bonds as of the date of the loan order <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5381.113s">including</a>  the payment of the principal redemption premium and interest on the bonds of the city to be refunded and the cost of issuance of refunding bonds is in proper form and further such refunding bonds are authorized pursuant to section 21a of chapter 44 of the general laws as amended the loan order properly grants the treasurer with the approval of the mayor the authority to issue such refunding bonds of the city and duly authorizes the city to qualify said refunding bonds pursuant to chapter 44a of the general laws as amended <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5405.834s">It</a>  is also understood the city's bond council prepared and reviewed the loan order. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5408.756s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5409.437s">And</a>  please let us know if you have any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5412.159s">So</a>  we have here, I think I just, in a very long winded way, we have a paper here that the city would like to reduce interest counts by refunding and potentially reissuing bonds and that you require this loan order to do so.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5427.89s">Yes,</a>  basically this allows the city to have the flexibility when interest rates <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5435.724s">are</a>  favorable and we can actually call bonds that we have issued and get savings from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5443.486s">This</a>  puts in place legislatively our ability to simply do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5450.128s">Our</a>  bond council and their bond issuers <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5457.978s">people</a>  that we work with, Phil Topper, Senator McInerney, and Abby Jeffers, keep an eye on the market, and they keep an eye on the debt that we have outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5468.181s">In</a>  this case, they brought up that there's some debt that we have from 2011, 2012, 2013, that is now callable, because it's 20-year debt, it's been out for 10 years, we can call all that debt, reissue that debt, and actually save money, save money over the next 10 years on the payment of that debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5487.566s">So</a>  depending on market conditions, sometimes it just makes sense to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5491.134s">In</a>  this case, it probably does. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5493.218s">So</a>  this allows the city the flexibility to do that when the conditions warn it.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5499.892s">Thank</a>  you, Director Dickinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5500.852s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5501.693s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5502.433s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5503.134s">This</a>  is common practice, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5506.655s">Every</a>  municipality does this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5507.936s">I</a>  think it's good practice.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5511.518s">I</a>  would guess that in the past, Medford has done this before.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5514.299s">I</a>  think we have.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5515.06s">Make</a>  sure that we've got this in place so we can get it to Hilltop and they can get it to Barnhill.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5520.242s">Right,</a>  I think that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5522.803s">For</a>  people to understand, I think that someone asked me a question, what does that mean, George? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5526.145s">I</a>  think that, simply put, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5528.426s">you</a>  had your mortgage and it extended so long, you can revisit it with a better rate and rewrite that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5537.871s">And</a>  I think that's that simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5545.094s">And</a>  we're talking about bonds, it's a lot of money if we could save a percentage point. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5548.719s">So</a>  yeah, I think this is good work.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5550.762s">This</a>  one going forward would probably be on the order of, I'd have to really go through all the figures because I always check them, but $40,000 to $50,000 for the next 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5559.373s">That's</a>  a teacher.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5563.258s">That's</a>  a teacher for the next 10 years or a police officer or a firefighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5566.48s">So</a>  I think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5568.121s">I</a>  appreciate you had worked with that and I would support this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5572.643s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5573.544s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5574.004s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5575.965s">Council</a>  Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5577.966s">Thank</a>  you for putting this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5579.607s">I'm</a>  looking for approval.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5582.549s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5583.609s">On</a>  the motion for approval, do you have a discussion question? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5587.491s">Sorry,</a>  Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5589.505s">Just</a>  a question, is this out of the Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund or is this out of the, these bonds, are those the bonds that we see coming out of the operating budget?</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5598.029s">The</a>  ones that we are looking at right now are high school science, DPWER is 75% operating general fund and 25% Water and Sewer Enterprise.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5622.833s">I</a>  believe the microphone is on.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5624.694s">I'm</a>  just too tall.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5628.256s">It's</a>  working. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5629.517s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5630.278s">Thanks,</a>  Bob.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5630.818s">I'm</a>  gonna bring my own microphone.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5634.08s">We're</a>  gonna get them replaced soon, but you might wanna, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5637.282s">Shane's</a>  about to yell at you for touching the thing too.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5639.924s">Here</a>  we are, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5642.645s">Is</a>  that better?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5643.166s">Thank</a>  you, thank you for recognizing that.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5645.327s">I'll</a>  be right over there, you can ask me any question you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5649.349s">So</a>  yeah, that's, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5652.031s">Sorry,</a>  where were we? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5655.594s">75%</a>  general fund, 25% water sewer fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5658.496s">So</a>  a little bit on that one issuance, a little bit of that savings would go to water sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5665.461s">Wonderful,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5667.403s">Great,</a>  and so yeah, this would apply to all bonds out of any funds?</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5671.846s">Yeah,</a>  it's three, well, it's actually five different issuances that are all 20 year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5679.964s">20</a>  year money that were issued in 2011 through 2013 that we're paying back.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5684.728s">So,</a>  um, is, is this, I guess my question is more, does this provide the city, the authority and perpetuity to conduct this process or only for these bonds? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5695.336s">Um,</a>  this is for any bonds when we, and we just need to make sure we have it on file somewhere that we actually adopted this and can't find it if we did it before.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5705.6s">Yeah,</a>  DPW yard, fire trucks, high school pool, and the high school science lab. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5712.943s">Those</a>  are all the ones that we're refunding, that they're talking about refunding right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5716.544s">Again,</a>  you know, this just gives us the authority that if, you know, if the Fed, it gets complicated, because you want to, you want to try to guess what the Fed is going to do, which of course, it's, I don't have a crystal ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5730.529s">Half</a>  a point maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5733.23s">next</a>  year, for instance, interest rates are low, and we have outstanding debt that is now callable because it's 10 years old, then it may be good to do this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5743.377s">And</a>  depending on market conditions, save the city more money.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5747.98s">But</a>  you wouldn't need to come back to us.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5749.281s">But</a>  we would not need to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5750.522s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5752.263s">All</a>  right, on the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5753.684s">Does</a>  this require multiple readings? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5757.987s">I</a>  don't think it's an amendment to the ordinances.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5764.364s">One</a>  second.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5766.845s">I</a>  don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5770.548s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5771.908s">On</a>  a motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli to approve, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5817.484s">I'll</a>  start by the most important one, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5820.687s">So</a>  I don't see the wildlife feeding ordinance as actually being too nice to people trying to do good things. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5828.997s">Like,</a>  for example, someone even complained about fruit trees on the previous meeting related to rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5835.504s">So</a>  here the ordinance says <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5839.178s">depositing</a>  directly or in feed or feeding shall mean the act of distributing, scattering, placing, exposing, or depositing directly or indirectly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5847.424s">So</a>  what does it mean, for example, I have fruit trees on my yard, and then a fruit happens to fall, or even if it doesn't fall, like these rodents can climb stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5856.471s">Am</a>  I actually indirectly feeding wildlife? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5859.133s">What</a>  happens if I have an oak tree and I have a bunch of acorns, like I get tons of squirrels, is that indirectly feeding wildlife? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5865.159s">What</a>  about if I'm trying to restitute soil health in my yard and I'm actually sowing cover crops to increase soil health? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5874.647s">What</a>  happens in the three to week <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5877.93s">in</a>  a couple of weeks until I get germination of those seeds and something comes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5881.532s">It's</a>  actually that directly feeding wildlife. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5884.413s">So</a>  I'm not sure that this is actually very well written. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5887.455s">And</a>  I think it's up to the interpretation of whoever is enforcing this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5890.917s">And</a>  I'm very concerned that residents trying to do something good for their soil, for the environment, avoiding having a lawn like everyone else has, this could be bad for them.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5905.564s">pause</a>  there for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5906.485s">I</a>  saw Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5907.567s">I'm</a>  saving your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5908.949s">Councilor</a>  Collins, have you had a response?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5910.35s">Gaston,</a>  if you're interested, I'm happy to share a little bit of the thought that went into this ordinance if you totally hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5917.019s">This</a>  was kind of the main question that we were keeping in mind when we were crafting this, because for me, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5924.204s">The</a>  goal is to have an enforcement mechanism for when accidental feeding is going awry without saying, hey, this benevolent thing that you're doing that isn't currently causing a problem, we don't wanna penalize that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5937.412s">So</a>  we worked hard to phrase this in such a way under prohibited activity, that section, to say there's no violation occurring until a problem occurs. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5948.478s">So</a>  for example, if there's a fruit tree, if there's fruit on the ground, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5952.04s">If</a>  it's not attracting wildlife at such a level where anybody's ever gonna notice or file a complaint, then it's not in violation of the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5961.066s">Does</a>  that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5962.487s">If</a>  it's happening and it's not problematic, it's not in violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5966.13s">If</a>  there's a problem going on and the board of health director or the court enforcement offer or the animal control officer visits and says, yikes, this is causing some problems, then if it's not ameliorated, it's a violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5978.779s">If</a>  that doesn't occur, it's not a violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5981.297s">So</a>  I just offer that.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5983.779s">Thanks</a>  for the clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5985.381s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5986.442s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5987.263s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5987.803s">Anyways,</a>  that helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5988.704s">So</a>  in the interest of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5990.166s">The</a>  floor is yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5991.607s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5991.927s">And</a>  then, so regarding the linkage fee, so I think it's, so first of all, so this means that we are adding a fee.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6002.017s">linkage</a>  fee right so one related to the affordable housing trust in addition to the four other ones this tonight no this tonight was just that the city has the authority to update i think there is an intent to add a fifth bucket as authorized by the legislation but that would have to happen through an ordinance separate from this</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6019.275s">And</a>  then I also had a question, why CPI versus, for example, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, which is like the PCE price index, or even something more specific related to, so I don't know exactly, I'd have to read about it, unfortunately, but you know exactly how the Affordable Housing Justice is gonna be used, but it's a linkage here, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6037.521s">So</a>  it has to be linked to whatever, to where you're collecting, to whatever you're gonna be used it for. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6042.643s">Why,</a>  for example, a basket of inflation goods that are related to whatever that affordable housing trust money is going to be used for? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6049.673s">Why</a>  CPI? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6051.275s">Why</a>  not BCE? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6052.436s">Why</a>  not something else?</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6056.584s">So</a>  when determining whether or not something will get through the state house, oftentimes you're reading the tea leaves. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6063.691s">But</a>  in this case, it was solely because they had already approved similar language with that same price index for the city of Watertown. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6071.76s">So</a>  they <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6074.122s">the</a>  state legislature would want consistency going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6077.626s">There</a>  wouldn't really be much of a reason for the city of Watertown to go for one price index and then Medford to just arbitrarily choose another. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6086.257s">So</a>  that's the justification behind that particular choice right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6094.847s">In</a>  terms of the Affordable Housing Trust, as Council President Bears said, that is independent of any votes that took place tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6101.41s">This</a>  was solely, the vote here was solely to ask the state to extend the period between these very expensive studies from three years to 10 years to save the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6113.334s">a</a>  little bit of money, and also to allow for automatic adjustments to be applied for these, because right now, I think that when they instituted this, they assumed that the cities would just do these studies every three years, and Medford in practice just never did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6127.016s">We're</a>  supposed to, we never did. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6129.437s">So</a>  this just allows a mechanism to prevent that, those fees from being eaten up by inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6135.678s">Right</a>  now they're worth less than half of what they were in 1990. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6142.359s">The</a>  affordable housing trust fund, sorry, the affordable housing trust linkage program. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6148.101s">So</a>  that is, there is currently a draft that essentially establishes a fifth bucket in addition to the four that currently exist to go into the affordable housing trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6158.365s">The</a>  affordable housing trust was already created by this council in the previous term. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6163.487s">And</a>  the state, the language of the state ordinance also allows for <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6170.63s">also</a>  allows for affordable housing to be one of those buckets. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6173.812s">So</a>  essentially all the ordinance would do is create a chain there that puts money into the bucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6184.698s">The</a>  thing is that in order to do that, you do need another completely new study, which would cost about $80,000 in order to figure out what exactly the amount of money that you're charging developers to go into the Affordable Housing Trust would be in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6201.131s">And</a>  right now, I've been working with the planning office to figure out how to fund that study, what the study would look like, and just generally corresponding with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6211.26s">In</a>  all likelihood, we wouldn't actually pass the ordinance until the study were conducted. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6218.727s">And</a>  so, you know, we would have a bit more of a basis for it, but I could talk for a while about the whole situation there.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6226.195s">Thanks</a>  for clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6227.096s">Just</a>  the last thing is like, so it does make sense to have linkage fees, because obviously, you know, you add density and then <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6234.463s">they</a>  require more resources so it does make sense to have funding for all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6238.555s">I'm</a>  just concerned that you know we also have to look <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6243.1s">holistically,</a>  kind of what Councilor Caput was saying in the sense of like, so if this increases costs for the developer, then that cost is gonna be passed on to the consumer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6251.325s">In</a>  this case, like, you know, whoever either, you know, buys that property, because I read the chapter 94, section 10, and it also applies to residential buildings of more than, I think it was like more than six units or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6264.973s">So,</a>  and commercial, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6266.554s">So</a>  I'm just concerned that, you know, we don't look at this holistically. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6271.698s">potentially.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6272.919s">We</a>  could be increasing costs to developers in such a way that then they will be passed on to the consumer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6278.483s">And</a>  so as long as, you know, when the time comes and we examine all those potential problems and we look at the trade-offs, then I think it works.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6286.889s">So</a>  the point of doing these studies is that this can be looked at holistically. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6292.113s">The</a>  reason that we're not just <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6295.995s">The</a>  reason that you don't just kind of arbitrarily come up with a number is because those situations might occur in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6302.519s">Right</a>  now, the planning office is trying to come up with funding to do a more comprehensive study on the other four buckets as well, just so that these situations don't actually happen, because you're right, you do need to account for a lot of other things, including what the city is already doing, the current costs of materials, labor, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6323.551s">et</a>  cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6324.472s">And</a>  so that is the purpose of doing one of these, uh, one of these studies in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6329.796s">Again,</a>  the city hasn't done one in 34 years, so we really need to do one. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6333.738s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6336.24s">I'm</a>  a fan of the, uh, IPD as a price deflator. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6341.043s">So,</a>  you know, if we want to get into that, I will say this as a home rule petition, if, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6348.428s">if</a>  the legislature were to be so kind as to deign to offer this council the authority to consider other price deflators, they could amend the Home Rule petition that we submitted, Representative Donato, Senator Jalen, Barbara, Representative Garberly, if they wanted to just say, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6363.775s">the</a>  price deflator chosen by the city council and the mayor or something like that, that would be possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6370.237s">But</a>  I do appreciate Councilor Leming's approach, which is if they passed it before, maybe they'll pass it again, which is a rarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6376.9s">They</a>  only passed eight laws this term, so sometimes a little tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6382.762s">But</a>  yeah, I'm an IPD fan because that's about that's the price bucket for state and local government relative constant GDP. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6389.169s">And</a>  I think that's actually what we should be using, because it's the stuff that cities buy versus what people buy, which is a little different, but we can avoid that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6397.977s">And</a>  it looks like everybody's bored. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6399.198s">So</a>  on behalf of the residents, please, please stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6408.533s">Motion</a>  to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6411.155s">Yeah,</a>  here's what he has. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6413.457s">I</a>  have a motion of council member to adjourn seconded by Councilor Keohane. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6417.601s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6418.641s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6418.862s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6419.162s">The</a>  motion passes, the meeting is adjourned.</p>
