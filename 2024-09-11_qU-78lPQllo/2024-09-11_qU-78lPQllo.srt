28
00:05:39,864 --> 00:05:44,148

00:06:42,156 --> 00:06:43,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

46
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:53,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it seems like I do this way too often when we talk about Medford residents that leave an impact.

47
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:58,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford lost one of their favorite sons, Frank Zizzo,

48
00:07:00,697 --> 00:07:08,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Frank leaves behind his amazing wife, Dorothy, and his children, Frankie Jr., Kerry, and son, Tyler.

50
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:18,650

51
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Grandfather, father, and Method Mustang.

52
00:07:24,926 --> 00:07:40,093
[SPEAKER_06]: He dedicated his life to make sure that kids in our community got what they needed, especially at the hockey rink when it came to Medford Youth Hockey, and especially when it wasn't that popular, our female youth, our female girls program.

53
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:44,736
[SPEAKER_06]: He really helped build that program and Medford is sad,

54
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:53,592
[SPEAKER_06]: for his loss and really would like to send our deepest condolences to the Zizo family.

55
00:07:53,932 --> 00:08:00,333
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's the type of person that has left a legacy that not too many people will forget if you knew him.

56
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:12,916
[SPEAKER_06]: And those who didn't should ask about him because it's someone that you want to, you want to remember or at least know his name because he's that, he was that much of an impactful person.

57
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:14,036

58
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:17,558

[SPEAKER_08]: I went to school with Tyler.

64

[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

00:08:57,877 --> 00:08:58,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

78
00:08:58,898 --> 00:09:10,688
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that with so much, so much devastation happening across the world, we seem to sometimes forget the pain and suffering that we felt here in our country.

79
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,301
[SPEAKER_06]: back in 2001.

80
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:22,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a day that everybody will remember where they were and left such an impact in everybody's lives that we should never forget September 11, 2001.

81
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:22,873
[SPEAKER_06]: And

82
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:29,997
[SPEAKER_06]: what that did to society and what it did to our world.

83
00:09:30,297 --> 00:09:46,868
[SPEAKER_06]: And remember all those people that perished that day and beyond because of the cleanup and you see the frontline workers that are passing now that worked on the rubble.

84
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,287
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an impact that we still feel today.

85
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:52,048
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that we should never forget that day.

86
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:57,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and, uh, it's something that I'd make the motion for a moment of silence for this council.

87
00:09:57,752 --> 00:09:58,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

88
00:09:59,794 --> 00:10:05,037
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of councilor Scarpelli to approve and have a moment of silence seconded by councilor saying all those in favor.

102
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:10,985
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe at this latest meeting, we were considering potential options for proposed updates to the zoning for the Mystic Avenue Corridor, as well as Salem Street Corridor.

103
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:15,407
[SPEAKER_13]: These are two of the shared priorities between the City Council,

104
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:20,151
[SPEAKER_13]: the city's planning department and I know many constituents in the city of Medford.

105
00:11:21,152 --> 00:11:38,329
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm really glad for the opportunity to prioritize that in our comprehensive look at our zoning and make sure that we are considering many goals and priorities for those two key corridors as we have this opportunity to change the zoning that will inform

106
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:41,112
[SPEAKER_13]: what it's easy to build and see and experience there.

107
00:11:41,892 --> 00:11:52,444
[SPEAKER_13]: And we will continue meeting with our, as I like to remind us every regular meeting, we'll continue to meet with Innis Associates at least monthly in the Planning and Submitting Committee, including tomorrow night at 6 p.m.

127
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:39,085
[SPEAKER_08]: 24461, resolution to meet and discuss updates to the Road and Control Ordinance.

128
00:12:39,145 --> 00:12:45,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it resolved that the Committee on Public Health and Community Safety meet with the Health Director to consider updates to the Road and Control Ordinance, Chapter 6, Article 4.

129
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:46,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins.

130
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:49,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Barras.

131
00:12:52,609 --> 00:13:17,895
[SPEAKER_13]: So I've been in conversation with, among other people within City Hall, our Board of Health Director, Health Director, Director O'Connor, about some amendments to the rodent control ordinance that she and her team are seeing on their side that they believe could help them better implement best practices and rules for residents and businesses to be part of our multi-pronged approach at mitigating

132
00:13:18,815 --> 00:13:21,196
[SPEAKER_13]: the growing rodent population in the city.

133
00:13:21,237 --> 00:13:32,143
[SPEAKER_13]: They've identified some changes that we could make within the text of the ordinance that would give them more latitude to enforce, such as how trash receptacles are placed and maintained on property.

134
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:39,767
[SPEAKER_13]: I've talked to a lot of people in the city and outside about this, and they say one of the problems that we're running into is just that we need to

135
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:50,094
[SPEAKER_13]: keep it tighter when it comes to how trash and recycling and things that attract rodents, how those are stowed around residential and business areas.

136
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:57,179
[SPEAKER_13]: So they've identified some changes in the ordinance that they would like for the council to consider that will just make enforcement easier on their side.

137
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,124
[SPEAKER_13]: We're considering a committee meeting date for next week just to get the ball moving on that quickly.

138
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:10,508
[SPEAKER_13]: And at the same time, I believe we're also going to consider a paper that's already before the council, an overgrowth ordinance,

139
00:14:11,388 --> 00:14:33,942
[SPEAKER_13]: which will have some same hopeful goals of giving the city more tools to where we see those problem areas in the city that are places where rodents are congregating, where the threat population is concentrated, give the city more tools to do enforcement around making sure those are cleaned up so that we're not harboring rodents where we don't need to be.

140
00:14:34,863 --> 00:14:38,585
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would motion to move this to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee.

141
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:45,771
[SPEAKER_08]: On the mention of Vice President Collins to move this paper to, refer this paper to public health and community safety, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

142
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:46,411
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

143
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:47,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed?

144
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:48,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

145
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:52,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins.

146
00:14:53,793 --> 00:15:02,016
[SPEAKER_13]: I would motion to suspend the rules to take papers 24463 and then public participation out of order.

147
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,383
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion to take paper two, four, four, six, three and public participation out of order.

148
00:15:08,463 --> 00:15:12,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by seconded by councilor saying all those in favor.

149
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:14,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed motion passes.

150
00:15:16,388 --> 00:15:18,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to speak before I read the paper?

151
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:19,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

152
00:15:21,977 --> 00:15:32,349
[SPEAKER_08]: 24463, a resolution to reappoint City Clerk Adam L. Hurtubise, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we reappoint City Clerk Adam L. Hurtubise to a new three-year term, be it further resolved that this term shall expire on September 10, 2027.

153
00:15:36,087 --> 00:15:36,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

154
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:49,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Because my reappointment is on the agenda tonight, I have filed an ethics disclosure downstairs that this could create the appearance of a conflict of interest.

155
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:56,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to step aside for this portion of the meeting, and Annie Kelly from our office is going to handle clerk duties for this point.

156
00:15:57,352 --> 00:15:57,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

157
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:00,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome, head clerk Annie Kelly.

158
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:06,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

159
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Any discussion on the paper or any motions?

160
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:13,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins.

161
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:15,270
[SPEAKER_13]: A motion to approve.

162
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,152
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion to approve by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

163
00:16:20,032 --> 00:16:21,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

164
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:23,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Callahan?

165
00:16:23,294 --> 00:16:23,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

166
00:16:24,555 --> 00:16:25,515
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Collins?

167
00:16:25,615 --> 00:16:25,815
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

168
00:16:26,796 --> 00:16:27,596
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Lozano?

169
00:16:28,297 --> 00:16:28,577
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

170
00:16:29,397 --> 00:16:30,077
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Lemme?

171
00:16:30,218 --> 00:16:30,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

172
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:32,524
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scott Kelly?

173
00:16:32,644 --> 00:16:32,844
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

174
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:34,205
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Sanz?

175
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:34,425
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

176
00:16:34,845 --> 00:16:35,465
[SPEAKER_16]: President Beers?

177
00:16:35,825 --> 00:16:36,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

178
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:38,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Having affirmative and negative, the motion passes.

179
00:16:39,186 --> 00:16:40,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Head Clerk Annie Kelly.

180
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:40,426
463.

181
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:46,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

182
00:16:46,248 --> 00:16:52,910
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's no conflict.

183
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,260
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

184
00:16:58,241 --> 00:16:59,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Next, we'll go to public participation.

185
00:16:59,743 --> 00:17:02,466
[SPEAKER_08]: First, we have a petition paper from Cindy Watson.

186
00:17:03,527 --> 00:17:05,849
[SPEAKER_08]: I will read it while we welcome Cindy to the stage.

187
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:12,996
[SPEAKER_08]: To the Honorable City Council of Councilors, the undersigned respectfully pray for support from the City Councilors in recognizing the importance of the Chevalier Theatre.

188
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,759
[SPEAKER_08]: The Chevalier is the economic engine for the City of Medford.

189
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:19,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Cindy Watson, 65 Valley Street, 4D, Medford, MA.

190
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:20,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome.

191
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:52,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

192
00:17:52,995 --> 00:17:53,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

193
00:17:57,157 --> 00:17:57,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Pardon me?

194
00:17:59,097 --> 00:17:59,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

195
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:15,283
[SPEAKER_01]: I've come before the City Council many, many times, pre and post Bill Blumenreich presents, and I'll also tell you that I wear my hat on my sleeve, I got a fire in my soul, and sometimes a mouth I can't control, so I'll try to be good during this meeting.

196
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:21,646
[SPEAKER_01]: As many of you know, Bill Boomerite took over about five years ago, he just renewed his contract.

197
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,509
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the absolute economic engine for the city.

198
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,074
[SPEAKER_01]: When he has a show, businesses are booming.

199
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:32,256
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you how many business owners have come up to me.

200
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:35,439
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sad that Salvatore's is still vacant.

201
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:46,806
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a lack of support from the city in all areas, whether it be the city council, school committee, et cetera.

202
00:18:47,346 --> 00:18:50,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Had this meeting, discussions with the board.

203
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:52,171
[SPEAKER_01]: We just celebrated our 30th anniversary.

204
00:18:53,286 --> 00:18:58,909
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the life of me, I can't understand why there's not more participation from everybody.

205
00:18:58,989 --> 00:19:04,032
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm here to sort of embrace all of you to get you to participate.

206
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:08,014
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also want to give a couple of highlights that we've done over the last 30 years.

207
00:19:08,735 --> 00:19:14,998
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to reiterate that I'm here on behalf of the friends in the Jean Mack Auditorium.

208
00:19:15,498 --> 00:19:19,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks probably don't know that we do a lot, a lot of work for underprivileged children.

209
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:40,451
[SPEAKER_01]: through the former Boys and Girls Club, which is now overseen by the Mystic Y. So again, just so that you can see, all of this came from volunteers, 30 years, half of them are still on the board, doing an incredible amount of work.

210
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:46,352
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I'm just gonna give you a brief synopsis.

211
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:48,453
[SPEAKER_01]: We've raised more than $1.4 million.

212
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:56,022
[SPEAKER_01]: for the Gene Mack Gym Recreation Center.

213
00:19:56,902 --> 00:19:59,363
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a tremendous grant writer on the board.

214
00:20:00,463 --> 00:20:10,126
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been responsible for spearheading grants that have brought in $500,000 to install air conditioning.

215
00:20:10,466 --> 00:20:11,547
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all volunteer.

216
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:14,247
[SPEAKER_01]: $88,000 to restore 19 original broken windows.

217
00:20:20,377 --> 00:20:27,482
[SPEAKER_01]: $90,000 to restore, I'm sure everybody's seen it, it was an eyesore going down Forest Street, the Chevalier facade.

218
00:20:28,843 --> 00:20:33,547
[SPEAKER_01]: We're fortunate to have State Representative Paul Donato on the board.

219
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:39,651
[SPEAKER_01]: He brings in probably through now various governors $100,000 a year.

220
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:48,618
[SPEAKER_01]: People may or may not know that each ticket that's sold at the Chevalier that Bill has a show

221
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:53,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can have two or three shows a week, 1,900 seats.

222
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take two shows.

223
00:20:56,683 --> 00:20:59,606
[SPEAKER_01]: That's $300 that goes back to the city.

224
00:21:00,847 --> 00:21:04,190
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I could go on and on.

225
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:07,974
[SPEAKER_01]: But just for whatever reason, it seems to be a dearth.

226
00:21:09,395 --> 00:21:10,915
[SPEAKER_01]: of just participation.

227
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:20,137
[SPEAKER_01]: So the former city councilors, and maybe a lot of you folks, I don't know as well as the others, but we had a city council that was on the board.

228
00:21:20,718 --> 00:21:23,738
[SPEAKER_01]: We had folks that came to our annual meetings.

229
00:21:24,358 --> 00:21:30,400
[SPEAKER_01]: We had folks that were very, very enthusiastic about supporting the Chevalier.

230
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,201
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm here tonight to try to work collaboratively with all of you to help our efforts.

231
00:21:37,537 --> 00:21:41,882
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't see people when we're down at various events in the city.

232
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:44,765
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's very frustrating.

233
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:47,708
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we want to work with you to reach out.

234
00:21:50,748 --> 00:21:52,689
[SPEAKER_01]: We've, Bill has been unbelievable.

235
00:21:53,489 --> 00:21:57,030
[SPEAKER_01]: He's very philanthropic when he hasn't sold a show out.

236
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:07,412
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll give tickets, extra tickets to folks over the senior center, people who are economically advantaged, don't have an opportunity to go to a show.

237
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:16,955
[SPEAKER_01]: He calls me or some of the other board members and will say, listen, he just, there was a show last Saturday, gave 20 seats away.

238
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:22,082
[SPEAKER_01]: people in the city of Medford would never have the opportunity to do this.

239
00:22:25,165 --> 00:22:29,589
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also transpired the youth center, as I said.

240
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:37,616
[SPEAKER_01]: These are kids, again, from diverse backgrounds, have never had the opportunities for educational devices, which we help support.

241
00:22:38,016 --> 00:22:42,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people think of the Friends of Chevalier, they just think, oh, well, they're working with a theater, but we're not.

242
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:45,443
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sort of a huge collaborative effort.

243
00:22:47,128 --> 00:22:57,894
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm asking you to sort of, if you can make more of a presence in the community, maybe start October 24th, come to the annual meeting, maybe become a member.

244
00:22:58,534 --> 00:22:58,975
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only $20.

245
00:22:59,075 --> 00:23:02,336
[SPEAKER_01]: We are revamping our membership.

246
00:23:02,537 --> 00:23:04,598
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'll admit it needs some work.

247
00:23:05,098 --> 00:23:10,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a tiered system that become a member for $100, you'll get a free theater ticket.

248
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:21,081
[SPEAKER_01]: But somehow the city has to recognize the strength of the Chevalier Theater, the board, and all that Bill Blumenreich does.

249
00:23:22,622 --> 00:23:24,403
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy to answer any questions.

250
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:32,050
[SPEAKER_01]: To assist anybody that wants to help us, we meet once a month.

251
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:37,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, some of these folks, we've got a 94-year-old woman who's on the board for 30 years.

252
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:41,863
[SPEAKER_01]: May mark your birth, people probably know us, Citizen of the Year.

253
00:23:43,064 --> 00:23:45,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, Paul Donato, Ken Crouse.

254
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:47,387
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can't say enough about the sport.

255
00:23:48,448 --> 00:23:57,776
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can recognize him because I'm with him once a month, but I think the city again has to acknowledge the work that the Friends of Chevalier does.

256
00:23:59,537 --> 00:24:00,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Cindy.

257
00:24:00,618 --> 00:24:01,519
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to Councilor Tseng.

258
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:02,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

259
00:24:05,191 --> 00:24:07,472
[SPEAKER_02]: First and foremost, I do want to thank you for your work.

260
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:09,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not just me.

261
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:10,433
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a team.

262
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:11,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know.

263
00:24:11,153 --> 00:24:13,694
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to get there.

264
00:24:13,734 --> 00:24:14,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to get there.

265
00:24:14,874 --> 00:24:20,236
[SPEAKER_02]: The friends of the Chevalier and Gene Matcham, I think really do do a lot of work for us.

266
00:24:20,556 --> 00:24:23,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been lucky enough to be on the Community Fund Committee.

267
00:24:24,577 --> 00:24:37,348
[SPEAKER_02]: where we see the applications from you guys trying to help, you know, we have a limited pot of money with that fund, but, you know, the mayor and I, in particular, advocated to try to make sure you guys got some money there.

268
00:24:38,008 --> 00:24:39,770
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much more that needs to be done, though.

269
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,252
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, I mean, really the application, there's

270
00:24:44,313 --> 00:24:50,138
[SPEAKER_02]: so much more that our city could be helping with and funds that we need to come in.

271
00:24:51,839 --> 00:25:00,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'd be helpful if we put a resolution on the next agenda, thanking the friends of the Chevalier and GMAC, Jim, for all the work that you've done over the last few decades.

272
00:25:02,885 --> 00:25:04,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you mentioned the membership.

273
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:11,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, I was, I was, I was thinking about, you know, just asking everyone in the room here to sign up for a membership.

274
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:18,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you were very persistent with me to remind me to make sure that I signed up for it and I did sign up for it.

275
00:25:18,732 --> 00:25:26,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Ken Kraus and I talk a lot whenever we see each other about what the theater needs and what the square needs in regards to the theater.

276
00:25:27,516 --> 00:25:28,377
[SPEAKER_02]: the gym and its deeds.

277
00:25:29,797 --> 00:25:36,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed, I really, I think, value that you brought up the gym as well, because I think people forget about the value of that gym.

278
00:25:37,242 --> 00:25:40,103
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember when I was young, I went, I did programs there.

279
00:25:41,184 --> 00:25:45,667
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many, so many of my friends, little brothers and sisters do programs there as well.

280
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:55,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I lament if the invitations to us to the annual meetings have slipped through the cracks.

281
00:25:55,667 --> 00:26:07,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we all get a lot of invitations as councillors, and I just wanted to ask through the chair if you could send us that invitation to the annual meeting again, just to make sure we all have it in our inboxes as well.

282
00:26:09,804 --> 00:26:12,446
[SPEAKER_02]: but I am grateful for the work that you all do.

283
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:19,171
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's not just you, and I know it's not just Ken, it's many people pulling the operation together.

284
00:26:19,191 --> 00:26:25,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate you coming here tonight to keep us accountable and keep us on our toes.

285
00:26:25,936 --> 00:26:28,438
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to paralyze resistance with persistence, Justin.

286
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:33,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's what you're saying, Vice President Collins.

287
00:26:34,735 --> 00:26:35,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

288
00:26:35,155 --> 00:26:54,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much for coming tonight I really appreciate it, especially knowing that there is a another even more star studded event that you could have been at tonight thank you so much for coming and speaking to us and, you know, continuing to raise the profile of Australia and in addition to all the work that you and the rest of the board is doing every week and every month we really appreciate it.

289
00:26:55,598 --> 00:27:03,802
[SPEAKER_13]: And I appreciate the, you know, kind of the reminder the call to action of how much this team is doing behind the scenes week in and week out.

290
00:27:05,203 --> 00:27:16,208
[SPEAKER_13]: I know as a counselor, one thing that I'm that I think we're always keeping an eye on kind of on an annual basis is making sure that the casino mitigation funds I know that there's a portion of that that's earmarked for the Chevalier, we want to make sure that that

291
00:27:17,188 --> 00:27:30,954
[SPEAKER_13]: remains because it's so important for this very uniquely Medford institution to be able to stay important, stay special, and stay competitive when these like very large corporate venues such as Encore do come into the region.

292
00:27:31,774 --> 00:27:39,658
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition, I've always really valued getting those like snapshots of progress and whenever the Chevalier comes forward with the CPA application,

293
00:27:40,774 --> 00:27:47,321
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always like this incredible pamphlet of what's been going on and how much more there is to do, whether it's restoring the building.

294
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:50,946
[SPEAKER_13]: I know there was a big organ restoration project that was wrapped up the past couple years.

295
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:56,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, I know that's just really scratching the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how much is going on behind those doors.

296
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:58,059
[SPEAKER_13]: every year.

297
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:03,780
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for, you know, platforming the membership drive, the annual meeting.

298
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:10,222
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love to get more involved and get a little bit more into the details about what you all are working on all the time.

299
00:28:10,262 --> 00:28:18,743
[SPEAKER_13]: I think as counselors, and especially as, you know, as residents, whenever the Chevalier is bringing in, you know, another great act every weekend, you see the cars.

300
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,404
[SPEAKER_13]: I know there's so often that I'm like walking down Forest Street.

301
00:28:21,424 --> 00:28:23,124
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, wow, they got that person?

302
00:28:23,184 --> 00:28:23,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Amazing.

303
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:24,344
[SPEAKER_13]: What a pull.

304
00:28:25,725 --> 00:28:26,725
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's visible.

305
00:28:27,782 --> 00:28:29,663
[SPEAKER_13]: what an incredible theater this is here in Medford.

306
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:33,724
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, it shouldn't go without saying how much work goes into keeping it that way.

307
00:28:33,884 --> 00:28:34,604
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

308
00:28:35,105 --> 00:28:35,585
[SPEAKER_01]: It's welcome.

309
00:28:35,705 --> 00:28:44,008
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to fight like hell to, you know, fought off Wynn at the Everett Casino because they were a huge threat.

310
00:28:44,868 --> 00:28:45,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

311
00:28:45,768 --> 00:28:47,169
[SPEAKER_01]: And we worked very, very hard.

312
00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:53,471
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we were some elite folks in addition to others, but it was, it was close.

313
00:28:56,792 --> 00:28:58,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Cindy, thank you so much for coming down.

314
00:28:59,153 --> 00:29:01,433
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to thank you and the friends for all the work that you do.

315
00:29:02,634 --> 00:29:08,916
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, whenever we see a CPA application or community fund or whatever it might be, I know we want to support the Chevalier as much as we can.

316
00:29:08,936 --> 00:29:11,837
[SPEAKER_08]: And supporting the friends is a key part of that as well.

317
00:29:12,677 --> 00:29:19,183
[SPEAKER_08]: and the organ society and all the other folks who have done so much for the for the building, you know, I'm on the Brooks estate board.

318
00:29:19,243 --> 00:29:31,073
[SPEAKER_08]: So I kind of understand firsthand a little bit what it feels like sometimes when you're trying to raise money for the city owned property, and then the city is not pitching in services and resources that are needed.

319
00:29:31,093 --> 00:29:37,619
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I am an advocate of trying to put more of the city's funds into supporting Chevalier directly, I know that there's a very

320
00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:42,241
[SPEAKER_08]: very small amount of money that's going to support Chevalier right now from the city budget.

321
00:29:43,442 --> 00:29:44,723
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's really important.

322
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:46,724
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for coming down.

323
00:29:46,804 --> 00:29:53,867
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do want to just ask, not just for us, but to share with anyone who may be watching, what's the best way that folks can join as a member?

324
00:29:53,927 --> 00:29:55,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a website to go to?

325
00:29:55,728 --> 00:29:58,009
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's the best way to sign up for the annual meeting?

326
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,692
[SPEAKER_01]: You can let me know, because it will be at the condo that I live in.

327
00:30:02,712 --> 00:30:06,234
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the association room.

328
00:30:08,703 --> 00:30:11,344
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm assuming that everybody will be there on the 24th?

329
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:16,587
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't promise everybody, but sure, some of us will attend.

330
00:30:17,787 --> 00:30:21,629
[SPEAKER_08]: But if the public wants to attend, how can they find out more and sign up?

331
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:27,432
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of info on the website, and we do send out a membership drive a month prior to that.

332
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:28,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

333
00:30:28,392 --> 00:30:29,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Approximately.

334
00:30:30,173 --> 00:30:33,095
[SPEAKER_08]: And is it friends, what's the URL?

335
00:30:35,111 --> 00:30:36,291
[SPEAKER_08]: friendsofthechevalier.com?

336
00:30:36,371 --> 00:30:39,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's actually another website, Zach, that we're revamping.

337
00:30:39,953 --> 00:30:40,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

338
00:30:40,293 --> 00:30:42,234
[SPEAKER_01]: So that should be up and running within a month.

339
00:30:42,294 --> 00:30:44,234
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some problems, some issues.

340
00:30:45,034 --> 00:30:49,796
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can go on, you know, the computer, just look under other friends and you'll, there's ample information.

341
00:30:50,196 --> 00:30:51,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you so much, Cindy.

342
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:52,557
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thank you for your time.

343
00:30:52,577 --> 00:30:58,639
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, this was public participation.

344
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have any other public participation at this time?

345
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,497
[SPEAKER_08]: please come forward.

346
00:31:04,537 --> 00:31:06,744
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the public participation section of the meeting.

347
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:11,979
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have any comment you'd like to make not related to a paper on the agenda.

348
00:31:23,024 --> 00:31:26,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing no one in the chamber, no hands on Zoom, public participation is closed.

366
00:32:34,097 --> 00:32:37,520

367
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,681
[SPEAKER_08]: The public hearing is open.

368

[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Juan.

371
00:32:44,283 --> 00:32:47,786
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the manager for the Panda Express located at 491 Riverside Avenue.

372
00:32:48,546 --> 00:32:50,568
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been there since May of 2018.

373
00:32:51,548 --> 00:32:55,691
[SPEAKER_00]: And through the years, we've seen the demand of people, the local community wanted to come back.

374
00:32:56,372 --> 00:32:59,454
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see our late night sale business continues to increase.

375
00:32:59,674 --> 00:33:08,561
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do want to serve the community in the late night hours, those emergency responders, those who are getting off work late, to extend our hours to three.

376
00:33:09,517 --> 00:33:10,758
[SPEAKER_08]: We just get your last name for the record.

377
00:33:10,778 --> 00:33:11,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

378
00:33:14,462 --> 00:33:16,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, with that, I will go to counselors for questions.

379
00:33:16,584 --> 00:33:18,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, thank you.

380
00:33:18,445 --> 00:33:19,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Three o'clock in the morning.

381
00:33:20,027 --> 00:33:21,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's not happening.

382
00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:27,194
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will, I will tell you, I think that when you look at the neighbors, unfortunately you do a butt neighbors, correct?

383
00:33:27,654 --> 00:33:31,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Across the street, you have, you have families and homes across the street.

384
00:33:31,938 --> 00:33:42,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think we can be very fair to look at what we've done historically for neighboring businesses with the idea of competition and fairness.

385
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:47,265
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will, Council President, I did ask for a report.

386
00:33:47,285 --> 00:33:51,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't heard back from the building office for inspections.

387
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:57,730
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm actually gonna ask to move this to a date certain, but I wanted to make sure we spoke

388
00:33:58,531 --> 00:34:04,542
[SPEAKER_06]: tonight because I wanted to get a report back to see if we've had any concerns or issues in the past.

389
00:34:04,602 --> 00:34:08,268
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that it's important that we understand that, um,

390
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:17,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Three o'clock in the morning is a little excessive and I think that that's when you're looking at what neighboring restaurants.

391
00:34:17,935 --> 00:34:21,999
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we've given some permits or some options till I believe one o'clock in the morning.

392
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:29,966
[SPEAKER_06]: But after that, I don't as one counts I would never entertain if people want that late late hours for anything.

393
00:34:30,646 --> 00:34:35,988
[SPEAKER_06]: For consumption, I think they can go into a business district and outside the city of Medford.

394
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:41,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think any resident, to be honest with you, this councilor, the three o'clock is just unreasonable.

395
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:44,250
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why we have the special permit in place.

396
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:48,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have a week to revisit it, to be honest with you.

397
00:34:49,691 --> 00:34:53,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the latest we have is one o'clock in the morning for some restaurants.

398
00:34:54,313 --> 00:34:58,954
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, even that to me is a little questionable because you are across the street from some homes.

399
00:34:59,634 --> 00:35:05,020
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's something I'll have to really think of before I make my vote.

400
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:19,055
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that before we do anything this evening, I'm going to ask to, after everybody adds any information or questions they have, but I'll be looking to move this to get a report back from the,

401
00:35:20,807 --> 00:35:26,670
[SPEAKER_06]: the building department to see with any complaints or issuances that have happened in that area.

402
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:31,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just your location, I'm not saying your location did anything wrong, I'm asking to see what's happening in that area.

403
00:35:32,332 --> 00:35:38,755
[SPEAKER_06]: And they haven't, unfortunately, they're a little undermanned, and so no one got back to me in time.

404
00:35:38,795 --> 00:35:46,359
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully we get an answer, and then next meeting we'll have a clearer vision of what I can vote on.

405
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:48,540
[SPEAKER_06]: But I thank you for being here tonight.

406
00:35:49,571 --> 00:35:53,520
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to continue to a date certain next meeting.

407
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Next meeting is next Tuesday, September 17th.

408
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:56,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

409
00:35:57,368 --> 00:35:58,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion?

410
00:35:59,602 --> 00:36:03,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President, Councilor Callahan, promotion.

411
00:36:04,346 --> 00:36:08,429
[SPEAKER_12]: Just wanted to ask, it does say Monday through Sunday, so seven nights a week.

412
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:20,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you talk a little bit about whether you've seen more demand on weekends, are there certain days that you would like it to be later, other days when it would be earlier, just based on what you've seen, what you think would work best for your business?

413
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:28,493
[SPEAKER_00]: I think overall, this business has been increasing more towards the late night, especially on the Friday, Saturday, Sunday area.

414
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:31,037
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do see the higher volume on those days.

415
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:34,522
[SPEAKER_00]: Any further discussion?

416
00:36:34,543 --> 00:36:36,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins.

417
00:36:37,346 --> 00:36:42,228
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to thank you for appearing tonight, and I think my fellow councilor's suggestions are good ones.

418
00:36:43,028 --> 00:36:51,331
[SPEAKER_13]: When we consider special permits like these, we wanna make sure that we're staying within what's been afforded to other nearby residents that we're keeping with precedent that's been established.

419
00:36:51,931 --> 00:37:02,055
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm sure that we can, like we have in the past, work together with yourself, city staff, residents, to make sure that we seek some sort of compromise that's still an improvement for everybody.

420
00:37:02,415 --> 00:37:02,676
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

421
00:37:02,696 --> 00:37:03,616
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, thank you.

422
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:04,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

423
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:10,514
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpa to continue this to the September 17th regular meeting, this public hearing seconded by Councilor Leming.

424
00:37:11,394 --> 00:37:12,055
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

425
00:37:13,015 --> 00:37:13,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed?

426
00:37:13,536 --> 00:37:14,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

427
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:16,358
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll come back next week and talk a little more.

428
00:37:16,418 --> 00:37:18,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys.

429
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

430
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,823
[SPEAKER_08]: 24457, request for amendment to previously approved grant of location.

431
00:37:26,225 --> 00:37:27,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have a wave of the reading?

432
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:32,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not want to read this entire letter from... Thank you.

433
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:37,431
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor San Buenaventura, the reading in favor of summary.

434
00:37:37,451 --> 00:37:38,311
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

435
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:39,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed?

436
00:37:39,472 --> 00:37:40,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

437
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:43,714
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a request from National Grid to the City Council.

438
00:37:44,594 --> 00:37:45,435
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a petition.

439
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:50,458
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a grant location application that was previously approved, and this is a request for amendment.

440
00:37:50,498 --> 00:37:54,620
[SPEAKER_08]: We've received communications from KP Law and City Engineer Wartella.

441
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:00,003
[SPEAKER_08]: The folks that want, I could read them, but,

442
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:06,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a synopsis from the engineer?

443
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:08,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, great.

444
00:38:09,001 --> 00:38:11,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a brief synopsis of the request?

445
00:38:11,183 --> 00:38:12,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

446
00:38:17,226 --> 00:38:20,828
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm Chris Radzig from the National Grid District Design Department.

447
00:38:20,988 --> 00:38:26,131
[SPEAKER_17]: And online, we have Mark Riley, the Assistant General Counsel for National Grid.

448
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:32,815
[SPEAKER_17]: We're here to speak on the amendment request for a grant of location previously

449
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:38,395
[SPEAKER_17]: approved by the Council last November.

450
00:38:41,357 --> 00:38:42,558
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you hear me?

451
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:44,299
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we can hear you.

452
00:38:54,861 --> 00:39:02,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, a brief background might be helpful, um, because it's been a while since November, since the city last saw this petition.

453
00:39:02,325 --> 00:39:14,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, it was a petition that, uh, which was granted to install underground electrical conduit on main street, um, close to the intersection of South street and then about 370 feet Southward.

454
00:39:15,412 --> 00:39:21,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, the company had met with Mr. Wartell and others to regarding the project and, um, had

455
00:39:22,662 --> 00:39:25,844
[SPEAKER_15]: come to what we thought was an agreement about street restoration.

456
00:39:26,784 --> 00:39:38,031
[SPEAKER_15]: And then that was reflected on a civil drawing that Chris has and can hand out, because I think it was erroneously left off when we filed.

457
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,592
[SPEAKER_15]: It was supposed to be attached to the letter.

458
00:39:42,233 --> 00:39:51,879
[SPEAKER_15]: During the hearing, the city council hearing, an additional condition was added that required the company to repair other streets that weren't affected by the project.

459
00:39:52,882 --> 00:40:08,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and then that, and then in addition, subsequent to the hearing and further conversations with, um, Mr. Wartell, it became clear that we didn't quite agree on certain aspects of the restoration in particular, what was meant by curb to curb repaving.

460
00:40:08,688 --> 00:40:12,110
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um, we're here to sort of remedy that.

461
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:20,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and the, the specifics of the requests are in the letter, but in some, um, we.

462
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:40,771
[SPEAKER_15]: Our proposal is to amend the condition to remove the requirement to repair or repave irrelevant streets, and then to allow us to either restore Main Street curb to median curb, or to pay the SPOF per section 74-1442B.

463
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:48,514
[SPEAKER_15]: And I can get into the explanation of

464
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:56,536
[SPEAKER_15]: our objections to restoring streets that aren't being disturbed, if you'd like, but I'll pause there.

465
00:40:59,497 --> 00:40:59,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

466
00:40:59,897 --> 00:41:09,561
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I remember correctly, if I may, just that what we had requested was that if there was a certain amount of pavement that was not going to be restored, that it be

467
00:41:10,578 --> 00:41:12,979
[SPEAKER_08]: the restore other pavement in lieu of restoring that pavement.

468
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:19,923
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that was the condition so that the square footage of pavement would, that would be the same that was restored or saying no.

469
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:23,045
[SPEAKER_17]: That was the general gist of yes.

470
00:41:23,145 --> 00:41:23,826
[SPEAKER_17]: The requirements.

471
00:41:24,246 --> 00:41:24,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

472
00:41:24,606 --> 00:41:24,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

473
00:41:24,946 --> 00:41:26,847
[SPEAKER_08]: I welcome his hard work.

474
00:41:40,242 --> 00:41:55,634
[SPEAKER_06]: that the biggest issues we have is that when they do open the streets, not just, not your company, but we're seeing too many, too many jobs that are left half done, and it's creating more havoc when people leave.

475
00:41:56,334 --> 00:42:00,037
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the biggest piece is having a curb-to-curb process.

476
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:06,302
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something that, to me, as one councilor, is a non-negotiable.

477
00:42:07,003 --> 00:42:09,765
[SPEAKER_06]: But from what I, just for clarification,

478
00:42:11,397 --> 00:42:26,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we saying that the roads that we're requesting, they will be paved curb to curb, but we're asking for other streets that are impacted to be repaved?

479
00:42:26,742 --> 00:42:29,623
[SPEAKER_06]: I just need some clarification on that.

480
00:42:30,003 --> 00:42:32,904
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think there's sort of two issues.

481
00:42:35,045 --> 00:42:36,666
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a curb to curb,

482
00:42:38,294 --> 00:42:56,523
[SPEAKER_15]: What grid understood at the hearing and in earlier discussions with the city engineer was that curb to curb meant that we would restore curb to the median curb, you know, the next nearest curb, which was the median strip.

483
00:42:58,704 --> 00:43:07,609
[SPEAKER_15]: The city engineer is taking the position that it should be curb to the, across the median to the other side of Main Street, which we're not touching.

484
00:43:08,727 --> 00:43:12,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and it, it exceeds any disturbed area.

485
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:20,296
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, we're willing to, to restore for the, for the length of our trench.

486
00:43:20,316 --> 00:43:23,359
[SPEAKER_15]: We're willing to restore main street curb to median curb.

487
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:28,703
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so there was that dispute about what curb to curb meant.

488
00:43:29,283 --> 00:43:37,890
[SPEAKER_15]: The second piece was that, um, you know, having to repair roads that we weren't touching at all that weren't main street.

489
00:43:38,573 --> 00:43:57,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and that's, you know, if, if nothing else happens today, that that has to come off, that's just a non-starter because as you can imagine, you know, grid is always kind of in the position of having to navigate requests from municipalities across our service territory.

490
00:43:57,945 --> 00:44:02,328
[SPEAKER_15]: And if, if, whether it's Medford or someone else is asking us to repair

491
00:44:03,345 --> 00:44:10,027
[SPEAKER_15]: different roads and we're disturbing, that's going to increase costs tremendously to everyone's detriment.

492
00:44:10,387 --> 00:44:13,968
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have to be a gatekeeper on that type of thing.

493
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Mr. President, if I can.

494
00:44:21,671 --> 00:44:27,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, I just wanna, go ahead, Councilor Scarpa, then we'll go to Vice President Collins and Councilor Zara.

495
00:44:27,072 --> 00:44:29,453
[SPEAKER_08]: I can also read the letter from council to the city.

496
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I too am a little leery of,

497
00:44:33,484 --> 00:44:44,082
[SPEAKER_06]: of the impact that this will make not only for the increased costs that would be then put on our ratepayers within the community.

498
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:46,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that because National Grid's not going to

499
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:48,930
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to take it on the chin, right?

500
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's going to be passed off somewhere.

501
00:44:51,591 --> 00:45:01,756
[SPEAKER_06]: But as I'm looking at it online, where we're looking at South Street and traversing down Main Street, I know exactly what you're saying.

502
00:45:01,836 --> 00:45:04,037
[SPEAKER_06]: That median was already developed.

503
00:45:04,097 --> 00:45:07,079
[SPEAKER_06]: That was in front of the police station.

504
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:07,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that where?

505
00:45:07,819 --> 00:45:07,999
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

506
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:09,220
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's already been done.

507
00:45:11,713 --> 00:45:39,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I could see your apprehension with that going across the street of the medium, because if I can ask the city engineer in this map and taking this route, even today, I didn't see, it didn't seem to be uneven or really damaged in that area on the other side of the medium anyway.

508
00:45:41,323 --> 00:45:53,874
[SPEAKER_06]: where we're seeing the work being done down South Street and all the way down Main Street, that is a no brainer of curb to curb, but that's something that I'd have to consider now.

509
00:45:54,995 --> 00:45:55,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

510
00:45:57,116 --> 00:45:59,538
[SPEAKER_08]: I could read the letter from Council if that would be helpful.

511
00:45:59,558 --> 00:46:02,520
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to get that summary out there as well.

512
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:08,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear Attorney Riley, thank you for your letter made 29th address to the City Engineer.

513
00:46:09,826 --> 00:46:11,908
[SPEAKER_08]: The City of Medford has asked us to respond as Council.

514
00:46:11,928 --> 00:46:15,651
[SPEAKER_08]: We have consulted with City Engineer, Director of Public Works and the Mayor in making this response.

515
00:46:16,351 --> 00:46:30,747
[SPEAKER_08]: then location as you know this matter concerns the proper interpretation of that certain grant of location 23445 issued by the city council on November 14 2023 approving national bridge petition to construct a line of electric underground electric conduits in main street at the location specified

516
00:46:31,348 --> 00:46:35,311
[SPEAKER_08]: The installation requires cutting and excavating a trench in the Main Street pavement for a length of approximately 370 feet.

517
00:46:35,372 --> 00:46:42,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Main Street in this location was fully reconstructed less than five years ago and contains a median strip separating opposing lanes.

518
00:46:43,378 --> 00:46:50,425
[SPEAKER_08]: This median strip is laid on top of the pavement bed, extending as a unbroken hall from the curb on one side of the roadway to the curb on the far side.

519
00:46:51,025 --> 00:46:55,789
[SPEAKER_08]: As a condition of the grant of location, the City Council required National Grid to provide repaving of another roadway.

520
00:46:56,870 --> 00:47:01,635
[SPEAKER_08]: equal to the work associated with curb-to-curb roadway restoration within the limits of the Main Street project.

521
00:47:02,135 --> 00:47:08,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Curb-to-curb is an industry standard term referring to the full width of the roadway, and the restoration condition must be interpreted as such.

522
00:47:08,381 --> 00:47:16,809
[SPEAKER_08]: The Council is familiar with the roadway in question, and if the Council's intent was to limit restoration limits to curb-to-median curb, it could have so specified.

523
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:19,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Please further note that Main Street is not a quote divided road.

524
00:47:20,352 --> 00:47:26,679
[SPEAKER_08]: That term is used specifically in the industry for highways and state routes with a large median frequently unpaved and northbound southbound designations.

525
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Main Street is not designated that way.

526
00:47:29,683 --> 00:47:37,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Restoration standard, the city readily acknowledges the authority of the Commonwealth to regulate the placement of utility lines in the city streets and with the application order DTE 98-22.

527
00:47:39,213 --> 00:47:46,295
[SPEAKER_08]: entitled standards to be employed by public utility operators when restoring any of the streets, lanes, and highways and municipalities as an extension of that authority.

528
00:47:46,355 --> 00:47:51,517
[SPEAKER_08]: In particular, section nine of the order sets forth the standards for pavement restoration following disturbance by utility.

529
00:47:52,518 --> 00:48:00,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Section 9.1 provides that quote, all pavement disturbed by the work, unquote, shall be replaced with quote, homogeneous and in-kind pavement to the original strength and condition.

530
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:05,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Quote, homogeneous is defined as of uniform structure or composition throughout.

531
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:15,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Sections 9.2 through 9.15, 9.15 set forth particular standards relative to pavement restoration without regard to the age of the roadway.

532
00:48:16,492 --> 00:48:22,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Section 9.16, however, provides that the municipality quote, shall have a jurisdiction to determine the pavement repair method

533
00:48:22,617 --> 00:48:25,879
[SPEAKER_08]: to be utilized on all pavements which have been installed for less than five years.

534
00:48:26,379 --> 00:48:36,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Pursuant to the grant location, the City of Medford has determined that the work proposed in Main Street, a street reconstructed within the past five years, requires curb-to-curb restoration within the project limits or its equivalent.

535
00:48:36,765 --> 00:48:46,071
[SPEAKER_08]: As set forth in Section 9.16, quote, method is simply the procedure for accomplishing the task, and a curb-to-curb restoration is the method the City has reasonably selected.

536
00:48:46,671 --> 00:49:01,882
[SPEAKER_08]: pursuant to section 9.16 of the order to restore Main Street to its original strength and condition, the structural integrity and life of a paved street as a whole is compromised by partial exclamations and patches, and such compromises can be avoided by curb-to-curb reconstruction to maintain the structural integrity of the street.

537
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:14,090
[SPEAKER_08]: The case, Colonial Gloss versus Town of Wilmington, cited by National Register for its interpretation of pavement with restoration requirements does not concern the disturbance of city streets reconstructed within the past five years, and thus does not apply to this matter.

538
00:49:15,231 --> 00:49:25,497
[SPEAKER_08]: The timing of restoration work, the terms and conditions for work in public streets allowed by a grant of location are determined by the appropriate permanent authority as designated by section 74-141 of the city ordinances.

539
00:49:25,597 --> 00:49:32,481
[SPEAKER_08]: In this case, the permitting authority for the Main Street project as approved and conditioned by the city council is the engineering division of the Department of Public Works.

540
00:49:33,082 --> 00:49:39,466
[SPEAKER_08]: As you are aware, National Grid attempted to bypass the permitting process by contacting the DPW commissioner directly after meeting with the city engineer.

541
00:49:40,086 --> 00:49:46,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Requiring the restoration work prior to commencing the Main Street project is essential to the city to ensure that the required work is satisfactorily completed.

542
00:49:47,149 --> 00:49:57,513
[SPEAKER_08]: National Grid has repeatedly not completed promised work, one still being from 2019, and therefore the permit authority engineering is conditioning the permit for the Main Street project accordingly.

543
00:49:57,613 --> 00:49:58,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your attention to this matter.

544
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:05,176
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have questions, please do not hesitate to contact me, very truly yours, Jonathan D. Eichmann, attorney at KP Law.

545
00:50:07,244 --> 00:50:30,477
[SPEAKER_08]: So it sounds like fundamentally the dispute is over the roadbed of Main Street and the city engineer and our council have made it clear that the median on Main Street is above the foundation of the roadbed and therefore curb to curb does not mean curb to median curb, but one curb to the other side because the roadbed is continuous under the median.

546
00:50:30,617 --> 00:50:31,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that correct?

547
00:50:32,198 --> 00:50:34,320
[SPEAKER_17]: For whatever reason that might have been.

548
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,663
[SPEAKER_17]: That seems to be, yeah, the sticking point.

549
00:50:39,223 --> 00:51:02,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Our original intention for restoration when we talked about Curve the Curb at the original petition hearing was median curb, which we felt was reasonable restoration for the approximately two foot wide trench that we proposed to dig along the edge of road curb on the west edge of Main Street in that section.

550
00:51:04,232 --> 00:51:07,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Vice President Collins and Councilor Zara, Vice President Collins.

551
00:51:08,834 --> 00:51:09,554
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Burris.

552
00:51:10,014 --> 00:51:11,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for being present to me.

553
00:51:11,594 --> 00:51:12,455
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your presentation.

554
00:51:13,355 --> 00:51:20,737
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm feeling a little confused about what's changed since, well, I'm not confused about what's changed.

555
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:27,440
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a bit confused about why there's been a change since the agreement that the council and the city department came to.

556
00:51:29,298 --> 00:51:48,235
[SPEAKER_13]: With National Grid last fall, I think that you know we had a essentially a contract between the city and National Grid stating the agreement curb to curb and stating these conditions that there would be an equivalent square footage or whatever the proper terminology is in this case that would be restored on

557
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:52,759
[SPEAKER_13]: adjacent seats close to the affected area.

558
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:59,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the stipulations that this council added to the special permit.

559
00:52:01,527 --> 00:52:03,048
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've had that in place since November.

560
00:52:03,869 --> 00:52:09,394
[SPEAKER_13]: So I admit I'm a little surprised to hear that characterized as a non-starter now, many months later.

561
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:18,731
[SPEAKER_13]: To be honest, I still think that the stipulations are very reasonable.

562
00:52:18,751 --> 00:52:30,526
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a little surprised to hear the notion of this affecting utility rates for Medford ratepayers because we know that rates are not set on a

563
00:52:31,167 --> 00:52:41,079
[SPEAKER_13]: granular city by city basis like that so that strikes me as a surprising thing to hear put forward in a public meeting I don't think that we should be making a decision based on that because we know that's not true.

564
00:52:42,401 --> 00:52:45,405
[SPEAKER_13]: And if I recall correctly from our discussions about this last term.

565
00:52:49,387 --> 00:53:15,304
[SPEAKER_13]: Part of the context around this conversation is National Grid did work in a similar area of Long Main Street quite recently, within five years, so this is asking the Butters to, you know, of course it's all for good reason, but it's asking the Butters to go through that inconvenience, again, in a relatively short timeline, and I think that's why it's important to make sure that if the Butters are to be put through that,

566
00:53:16,084 --> 00:53:23,568
[SPEAKER_13]: that, you know, we get back an appropriate public benefit in the term of that curb-to-curb restoration.

567
00:53:23,588 --> 00:53:39,437
[SPEAKER_13]: And as long as there's work being done, you know, disrupting traffic and neighbors in the area, I think it's appropriate to stick with the original stipulation that we have equivalent square footage restoration in those other areas that the Council stipulated back in November.

568
00:53:39,457 --> 00:53:40,298
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

569
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Collins stole some of my things that I was going to say, but thank you.

570
00:53:51,482 --> 00:53:54,043
[SPEAKER_11]: That was very concise and well put.

571
00:53:54,763 --> 00:54:03,528
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I did want to mention was that this is an amendment to a previously approved contract, as Vice President Collins mentioned.

572
00:54:03,568 --> 00:54:05,949
[SPEAKER_11]: So this was something that was already agreed to.

573
00:54:07,324 --> 00:54:12,587
[SPEAKER_11]: We've, we've said many times curb to curb being the industry standard so nobody ever says median.

574
00:54:13,908 --> 00:54:17,589
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can also say I have, I live on a street that had work done.

575
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:22,732
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was before the past five years, and there was a

576
00:54:23,352 --> 00:54:38,037
[SPEAKER_11]: gas line that was replaced by National Grid under my street, and only half of our street was paved, which means there's a seam in the middle of the street, which means that there is already deterioration in the center of the road.

577
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:45,093
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why it's important that we carry on the paving from one end of the street to the other end of the street.

578
00:54:45,673 --> 00:54:51,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Main street being an extremely busy road, that intersection being complicated to drive through as it is.

579
00:54:51,794 --> 00:54:54,095
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the police station, we have a fire station.

580
00:54:55,355 --> 00:54:56,175
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very busy.

581
00:54:56,195 --> 00:55:08,077
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't want to put our residents in any kind of situation where they would be facing any more complicated or dangerous scenarios at that intersection.

582
00:55:08,607 --> 00:55:21,249
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's pretty clear to me that this is not something I would want to risk safety or cost in the future, but I appreciate the opportunity to look into it more in depth.

583
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:22,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

584
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:24,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

585
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:27,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a minute.

586
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:30,251
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to attorney, we'll go to Councilor Callahan.

587
00:55:30,451 --> 00:55:31,892
[SPEAKER_08]: You can tell it's been a month since I've done this.

588
00:55:32,592 --> 00:55:33,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan and Councilor Tseng.

589
00:55:35,868 --> 00:55:37,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

590
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:47,235
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to mention that I did knock on thousands of doors last summer and fall, and this issue came up really a surprising number of times.

591
00:55:47,335 --> 00:56:01,963
[SPEAKER_12]: How many residents commented that within the first few years after completely repaving a street, that some project would come in and rip up the street again, and that they felt that that was a poor use of city funds.

592
00:56:03,704 --> 00:56:16,287
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think this is important that we, as a city, require full repaving of city streets when it is within five years of the paving of a street.

593
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:30,751
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure that it is within the business model of National Grid to fully repave roads that have been from curb to curb that have been paved within the last five years.

594
00:56:31,109 --> 00:56:34,932
[SPEAKER_12]: simply because that is just a normal process of doing business, doing the kind of business that you do.

595
00:56:36,974 --> 00:56:47,803
[SPEAKER_12]: It may also be something that you realize that when a city council has changed personnel, that perhaps you might get a different opinion.

596
00:56:47,823 --> 00:56:56,550
[SPEAKER_12]: And that may be your job, but my job is to fight for what the city should be getting in this business contract.

597
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:58,491
[SPEAKER_12]: And within this business contract, it is,

598
00:57:00,965 --> 00:57:05,206
[SPEAKER_12]: The normal thing, the thing that we need to request is that you do full curb-to-curb repaving.

599
00:57:06,207 --> 00:57:26,612
[SPEAKER_12]: And if the agreement was made in the past, that it makes more sense for both parties for that to be moved to a different street, but that the cost of the repaving is fully reimbursed by National Grid, then I feel very comfortable with that agreement that was made in November.

600
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:30,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

601
00:57:30,962 --> 00:57:34,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I echo my council colleagues frustration with the matter.

602
00:57:36,604 --> 00:57:38,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Councilor Callaghan put it really well.

603
00:57:38,725 --> 00:57:40,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear this a lot from our residents.

604
00:57:41,066 --> 00:57:57,973
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, having read through the two memos from the attorneys, having read through the cases cited and the statutes at hand, I think I would recommend to the Council that we table this matter, that we seek a meeting with legal representation just

605
00:57:58,493 --> 00:58:09,864
[SPEAKER_02]: to do our due diligence to figure out what these cases mean, what precedents they hold for us, and what rules we're bound to.

606
00:58:11,826 --> 00:58:14,008
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would put that in the form of a motion.

607
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:19,233
[SPEAKER_08]: A motion to table is undebatable.

608
00:58:20,754 --> 00:58:22,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it about the motion itself?

609
00:58:23,177 --> 00:58:23,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

610
00:58:24,813 --> 00:58:29,717
[SPEAKER_08]: And technically we can't actually table, it's not gonna be a motion to continue the public hearing to a date certain, which is debatable.

611
00:58:29,737 --> 00:58:31,858
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a public hearing.

612
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:35,021
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an amendment to grant allocation.

613
00:58:35,041 --> 00:58:35,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Nevermind, so we can table it.

614
00:58:38,443 --> 00:58:39,084
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your question?

615
00:58:40,124 --> 00:58:50,712
[SPEAKER_11]: If we table this amendment, does it delay the work that is scheduled, any work that is scheduled or anything that needs to- I don't know, but that's-

616
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:53,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, there's a delay to the work.

617
00:58:54,511 --> 00:58:55,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there work currently scheduled?

618
00:58:55,912 --> 00:58:57,853
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, is there work scheduled?

619
00:58:57,993 --> 00:59:02,396
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been attempting to do the work, I'd say for a year and a half.

620
00:59:03,256 --> 00:59:10,440
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been working through many steps to get to the point where we can go in and get an approved road opening permit.

621
00:59:11,301 --> 00:59:12,762
[SPEAKER_17]: And we haven't been able to do that yet.

622
00:59:13,162 --> 00:59:16,624
[SPEAKER_17]: This is one of the last items to clear up.

623
00:59:17,611 --> 00:59:22,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I do have questions myself and haven't had the chance to ask them.

624
00:59:27,076 --> 00:59:32,920
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think since the rate payers were brought up, do you know what the annual profit was of the Massachusetts Electric Company last year?

625
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,581
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't, no.

626
00:59:34,861 --> 00:59:35,421
[SPEAKER_08]: It was $104 million.

627
00:59:35,441 --> 00:59:37,342
[SPEAKER_08]: The year before that it was 120, year before that 122.

628
00:59:37,382 --> 00:59:38,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Your parent company in the UK?

629
00:59:43,502 --> 00:59:45,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Annual profits, 7.97 billion.

630
00:59:46,824 --> 01:00:04,996
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the assertion of returning this to the rate payers is indicative of the failure of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to structure our public utility system in a way that is beneficial to the public, and not in a way that pads the profits of very large corporations, which aren't even headquartered in this country, nevermind the state.

631
01:00:08,166 --> 01:00:09,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Is your motion to table?

632
01:00:09,506 --> 01:00:09,827
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

633
01:00:10,787 --> 01:00:14,108
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion to table of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

634
01:00:14,808 --> 01:00:16,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

635
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, we have a letter from legal.

636
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:25,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.

637
01:00:25,332 --> 01:00:25,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

638
01:00:27,853 --> 01:00:33,395
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion to table and request legal representation by Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

639
01:00:40,646 --> 01:00:40,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yes.

640
01:00:41,206 --> 01:00:44,767
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, when I said $7.97 billion, it's actually 7.97 billion pounds.

641
01:00:45,288 --> 01:00:45,608
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad.

642
01:00:47,508 --> 01:00:48,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Herbies, please call the roll.

643
01:00:49,749 --> 01:00:50,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Kellogg?

644
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:50,930
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

645
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:52,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me?

646
01:00:53,951 --> 01:00:54,131
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

647
01:00:58,072 --> 01:00:58,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Collins?

648
01:00:59,113 --> 01:00:59,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

649
01:01:01,513 --> 01:01:02,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lozano?

650
01:01:02,474 --> 01:01:02,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

651
01:01:04,314 --> 01:01:04,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Leming?

652
01:01:05,755 --> 01:01:05,835
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

653
01:01:07,807 --> 01:01:08,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

654
01:01:08,688 --> 01:01:08,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

655
01:01:09,909 --> 01:01:10,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Sanchez?

656
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:10,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

657
01:01:11,912 --> 01:01:12,512
[SPEAKER_05]: President Bears?

658
01:01:12,712 --> 01:01:12,993
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

659
01:01:13,013 --> 01:01:14,594
[SPEAKER_08]: 4 in the affirmative, 3 in the negative.

660
01:01:14,775 --> 01:01:23,624
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion is tabled.

661
01:01:23,644 --> 01:01:26,267
[SPEAKER_08]: 6-4, petition for a common victor's license and is on market.

662
01:01:27,889 --> 01:01:29,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me one moment here.

663
01:01:31,544 --> 01:01:40,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Business, Muammar Barakteli, Nazar Market, 325 Rivers Edge Drive, Medford, and owner at 103 Beach Street, apartment one, Belmont.

664
01:01:40,892 --> 01:01:43,253
[SPEAKER_08]: On fire, we have business certificate 2024, number 20.

665
01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:56,164
[SPEAKER_08]: The petition has been received, letter of compliance received, state tax ID received, workers' compensation received, treasure collector received, building department received, fire department received, police department, traffic impact received, and health department received.

666
01:01:57,025 --> 01:02:01,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a representative of Nazar Market here to speak to their petition?

667
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:11,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone here for Nazar Market to represent on the petition?

668
01:02:16,893 --> 01:02:18,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Either in person or on Zoom.

669
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:19,974
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're on Zoom, please raise your hand.

670
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:31,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone for Nazar Market, common victuals license?

671
01:02:34,842 --> 01:02:35,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, is there a motion on the floor?

672
01:02:37,403 --> 01:02:40,184
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion to the table by Councilor Zahra, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

673
01:02:40,204 --> 01:02:40,984
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

674
01:02:41,004 --> 01:02:41,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

675
01:02:41,904 --> 01:02:42,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed?

676
01:02:42,585 --> 01:02:49,627
[SPEAKER_08]: A motion passes.

677
01:02:49,647 --> 01:02:52,508
[SPEAKER_08]: 24047, resolution to request linkage fee updates in the city of Medford.

678
01:02:57,862 --> 01:03:00,564
[SPEAKER_08]: an act updating the linkage exaction program in the city of Medford.

679
01:03:00,604 --> 01:03:06,547
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a request by Councilor Leming pursuant to previous motions passed on updating the linkage fee.

680
01:03:07,247 --> 01:03:14,631
[SPEAKER_08]: We have here two honorable representatives, Christine Barber, Paul Donato, and Sean Garberly, and our honorable Senator Patricia Jalen attached as a home rule petition to update the 1989 act.

681
01:03:16,112 --> 01:03:17,713
[SPEAKER_08]: that established Medford's linkage program.

682
01:03:17,773 --> 01:03:23,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Since 1989, this act has provided a critical source of funds for our police, our parks, our roads and traffic, and our water and sewers.

683
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:32,361
[SPEAKER_08]: The current act requires a new study every three years to update the exact amount of linkage fees, but in practice, since its institution in 1990, Medford has never performed such a study.

684
01:03:32,881 --> 01:03:38,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Thus, the exact linkage amounts have not been updated since 34 years ago and have been drastically undervalued by the effects of inflation.

685
01:03:38,945 --> 01:03:42,527
[SPEAKER_08]: As the city works to update the linkage fees and add a new source of revenue for affordable housing,

686
01:03:43,107 --> 01:03:46,730
[SPEAKER_08]: We find that the original requirement for review every three years was likely to cost prohibitive.

687
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,691
[SPEAKER_08]: We therefore request two updates to the Act.

688
01:03:48,751 --> 01:03:51,413
[SPEAKER_08]: The first extends the period of review from three years to 10 years.

689
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:54,134
[SPEAKER_08]: This mandates a more reasonable period in between studies.

690
01:03:54,615 --> 01:03:58,858
[SPEAKER_08]: The second allows for automatic updates to linkage fees in between studies based on an inflation index.

691
01:03:58,878 --> 01:04:09,265
[SPEAKER_08]: This would prevent fees from being undervalued over time from inflation and uses the same language that is as that established for the City of Watertown in 2022 Act of the Legislature, Chapter 302 of the Acts of 2022.

692
01:04:09,605 --> 01:04:12,627
[SPEAKER_08]: We've enclosed the proposed language of the Act.

693
01:04:13,527 --> 01:04:14,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Sincerely, Councilor Leming.

694
01:04:14,688 --> 01:04:23,931
[SPEAKER_08]: An act updating the linkage exaction program in the City of Medford, Chapter 488 of the Acts of 1989, an act establishing a linkage exaction program in the City of Medford is hereby updated as follows.

695
01:04:24,551 --> 01:04:34,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Section 2, Part 5 shall now read, the level of any exaction shall be reviewed at least every 10 years and reset as required based on the recommendation of the Office of Community Development and the Mayor of said City.

696
01:04:34,714 --> 01:04:44,181
[SPEAKER_08]: In between reviews, updates to any exaction may be adjusted over time or retroactively based on changes in the consumer price index for all urban consumers compiled by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.

697
01:04:45,002 --> 01:04:45,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Leming.

698
01:04:46,723 --> 01:04:49,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Council President Bears.

699
01:04:49,625 --> 01:05:01,855
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the result of a lot of discussions that I've been having with the Office of Community Development as we try to

700
01:05:02,655 --> 01:05:06,918
[SPEAKER_03]: update the linkage program, the capital improvements program.

701
01:05:06,978 --> 01:05:18,346
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is essentially when developers come in to the city, they need to pay fees into certain buckets, which will help to improve the city as a whole.

702
01:05:19,547 --> 01:05:26,052
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're trying to do with this program is first to update the original amounts that were proposed in 1990 when this was established.

703
01:05:26,612 --> 01:05:37,859
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're also trying to add a fifth bucket in addition to the ones already mentioned in the letter for affordable housing to provide a more constant source of revenue to the affordable housing trust.

704
01:05:38,659 --> 01:05:43,502
[SPEAKER_03]: We previously discussed changes to the ordinance at earlier meetings.

705
01:05:43,962 --> 01:05:44,663
[SPEAKER_03]: The issue is that

706
01:05:45,083 --> 01:05:55,071
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the changes that we're proposing after legal review, it turns out you would need to go back to the state to actually update those in a couple of ways.

707
01:05:55,091 --> 01:05:57,633
[SPEAKER_03]: So in order to actually do these updates every

708
01:06:02,256 --> 01:06:04,797
[SPEAKER_03]: three years as is required by that ordinance.

709
01:06:06,138 --> 01:06:08,639
[SPEAKER_03]: One study to do that could cost as much as $150,000.

710
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:13,502
[SPEAKER_03]: And so doing that every three years is too cost prohibitive.

711
01:06:13,702 --> 01:06:21,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Just performing the nexus study to establish a new bucket entirely for the affordable housing trust would probably cost about $80,000.

712
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:28,290
[SPEAKER_03]: The planning department has been going around trying to find consultants who are willing to do that.

713
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:30,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford has a bit of a unique linkage program.

714
01:06:31,972 --> 01:06:36,675
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they are having trouble finding a consultant for a reasonable price that can do that.

715
01:06:37,135 --> 01:06:50,402
[SPEAKER_03]: So what this would do first is it would just extend that to save the city a little bit of money because the full linkage program really wouldn't update that much within a three year period that you would actually need to do that study.

716
01:06:50,422 --> 01:06:53,543
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 years is a more reasonable timeframe to do these.

717
01:06:54,884 --> 01:06:58,105
[SPEAKER_03]: We've gone 34 years without doing one.

718
01:06:58,166 --> 01:07:02,227
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think getting away from that three year mark is reasonable.

719
01:07:02,547 --> 01:07:10,231
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second, which is very important, is literally just copied and pasted from a similar program that Watertown did in

720
01:07:11,372 --> 01:07:25,482
[SPEAKER_03]: 2022, where instead of just having these linkage prices set and just consistently get undervalued by inflation at the same time, there will be automatic updates from year to year so that the city is not losing money over time.

721
01:07:25,643 --> 01:07:32,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the less that we do, if we happen to have, you know, staff or boards who just

722
01:07:33,291 --> 01:07:39,376
[SPEAKER_03]: don't do what they're supposed to do and perform these studies every few years, we would just be losing money over time.

723
01:07:40,217 --> 01:07:46,703
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, it's a fairly simple update, but it does need to go to the state for approval.

724
01:07:46,923 --> 01:07:56,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would motion to approve this home rule petition and send it to the mayor.

725
01:07:58,587 --> 01:08:03,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to approve the homework petition and send it to the mayor, seconded by Vice President Collins.

726
01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:05,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions or discussion?

727
01:08:06,155 --> 01:08:06,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Kalia.

728
01:08:08,698 --> 01:08:13,263
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to comment that I'm incredibly thrilled about the work that Council on Learning has done.

729
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:23,100
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

730
01:08:25,162 --> 01:08:27,444
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm thrilled about the work that Councilor Leming has done on this.

731
01:08:28,385 --> 01:08:34,811
[SPEAKER_12]: As I hope people understand, this City Council has really taken the funding of this city very seriously.

732
01:08:36,372 --> 01:08:43,079
[SPEAKER_12]: We have been underfunded for a long time, and the linkage fees are one of the few places where we can actually

733
01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:49,524
[SPEAKER_12]: obtain more funds that does not affect property taxes.

734
01:08:49,904 --> 01:08:53,026
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is something that I think everyone here should be really excited about.

735
01:08:53,707 --> 01:08:55,648
[SPEAKER_12]: It has not been updated in 34 years.

736
01:08:55,668 --> 01:08:57,009
[SPEAKER_12]: It is definitely undervalued.

737
01:08:57,029 --> 01:08:59,511
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a way that we are going to bring income into the city.

738
01:09:00,572 --> 01:09:07,317
[SPEAKER_12]: And then these changes that make sure that even if a study is not done regularly,

739
01:09:07,717 --> 01:09:13,519
[SPEAKER_12]: that we continue to increase those at the price of inflation is truly a fantastic work.

740
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,100
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very excited about it.

741
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:16,801
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you, Councilor Leming, for the work that you're doing.

742
01:09:17,401 --> 01:09:18,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Kellyanne.

743
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:19,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion?

744
01:09:19,782 --> 01:09:20,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I can.

745
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:21,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

746
01:09:21,463 --> 01:09:26,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank Councilor Leming to look into this, but I think we need to be very careful.

747
01:09:26,024 --> 01:09:28,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Neighborhood communities have looked at

748
01:09:30,475 --> 01:09:35,838
[SPEAKER_06]: the vision of development without a full comprehensive plan, and it's a good idea.

749
01:09:35,858 --> 01:09:46,644
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it has to be looked at, but I think we better be careful in what, in totality, what we're doing in this community when you're looking for development and what we're asking for developers.

750
01:09:47,485 --> 01:09:58,851
[SPEAKER_06]: We're seeing impacts in neighboring communities where they had some similar issues and they thought would be great ideas, and instead what they did is they further pushed developers further away from the communities.

751
01:09:59,572 --> 01:09:59,692
[SPEAKER_06]: And

752
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:08,892
[SPEAKER_06]: It really hurt neighboring communities with the fact that neighboring communities lost millions of dollars because of their processes.

753
01:10:08,912 --> 01:10:18,874
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think this is something that, you know, when Mayor McGlynn put this in place, he had the foresight to look at this and say, this is what we want.

754
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:25,815
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why they set up a trust for each, how do they put it, that each,

755
01:10:27,463 --> 01:10:40,771
[SPEAKER_06]: each stakeholder that within the city that would be impacted, the impacted departments, which would have been, I believe the school department, parks and recreation, DPW, water and sewer.

756
01:10:40,811 --> 01:10:42,032
[SPEAKER_03]: The linkage funds are for?

757
01:10:42,332 --> 01:10:44,073
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the linkage funds don't go to the schools.

758
01:10:44,133 --> 01:10:45,074
[SPEAKER_03]: It listed in the letter.

759
01:10:46,095 --> 01:10:49,096
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay, so this is- Water, sewer.

760
01:10:52,426 --> 01:10:57,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it's the police department, parks and rec, roads and traffic, water and sewers.

761
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:02,253
[SPEAKER_08]: And the authorizing legislation also enabled an affordable housing, but that was never established.

762
01:11:02,273 --> 01:11:08,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the authorizing legislation kind of gave a list of buckets that it could potentially go into, and affordable housing was one of them.

763
01:11:09,419 --> 01:11:12,901
[SPEAKER_03]: But when they actually implemented it in 1990, they only chose those four.

764
01:11:12,961 --> 01:11:13,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, right.

765
01:11:13,742 --> 01:11:21,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I stand to say it was road and traffic, road and traffic linkage, parks and recreation linkage, police and fire linkage, water and sewer linkage.

766
01:11:23,639 --> 01:11:32,547
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that the other question people had was this, are we going to be looking at small development of someone who was refurbishing their home or adding an addition?

767
01:11:32,647 --> 01:11:37,932
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, no, it would be for... This wouldn't change what linkage currently applies to.

768
01:11:38,552 --> 01:11:38,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

769
01:11:38,793 --> 01:11:42,836
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be with the special... Is it special...

770
01:11:43,957 --> 01:12:03,970
[SPEAKER_06]: site plan review correct okay all right so i just like i said i think that uh understanding the history was important and i think that it does need to be looked at but i think that we should be very careful and you know without a real comprehensive plan that at least i haven't seen in what direction this city's going and

771
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:07,822
[SPEAKER_06]: when it's growth and development, I think it's a little dangerous.

772
01:12:07,862 --> 01:12:08,343
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

773
01:12:08,443 --> 01:12:17,929
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would just note that this change would just provide the authority to the city to update the linkage fees and to have an escalator for inflation costs.

774
01:12:18,509 --> 01:12:21,871
[SPEAKER_08]: The city still needs to conduct a nexus study to actually update the rates.

775
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:33,019
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think we can all agree that what we assessed as the impact of police and fire roads or parks or streets and roads 34 years ago isn't what it's costing the city today.

776
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:41,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this would just allow for, this would just allow those automatic inflation based updates.

777
01:12:41,167 --> 01:12:49,236
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's a very specific, it's a very specific price index that's stated in the proposed change.

778
01:12:49,436 --> 01:12:52,399
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was already done over in Watertown.

779
01:12:52,419 --> 01:12:53,741
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is becoming standardized.

780
01:12:54,401 --> 01:13:06,668
[SPEAKER_03]: neighboring cities, it would also save the city money by expanding the requirement to actually do these studies from three to 10 years, because these studies are pretty cost intensive.

781
01:13:07,489 --> 01:13:18,935
[SPEAKER_08]: It also addresses the Supreme Court decision around, I believe, the rationale for the nexus studies, that if you're assessing impact fees, it has to be based on a rational basis test for having a study.

782
01:13:19,535 --> 01:13:21,176
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's part of this as well.

783
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:22,297
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a recent court case.

784
01:13:23,837 --> 01:13:24,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Council Vice President Collins.

785
01:13:26,119 --> 01:13:26,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

786
01:13:26,439 --> 01:13:42,350
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate the councilor for bringing this forward for lots of reasons, including we have so many discussions inside these chambers about the pretty vast budgetary needs facing so many of our city departments, including the four that are specifically targeted by linkage.

787
01:13:43,771 --> 01:14:00,931
[SPEAKER_13]: And we need to be keeping pace with other communities in adopting and evolving to those best practices for how to have sources of revenue that don't just come from sales tax and property tax because our needs are too great.

788
01:14:01,371 --> 01:14:07,897
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have a comprehensive plan, the city of Medford comprehensive plan was put together over the course of several years with a ton of resident feedback.

789
01:14:09,078 --> 01:14:10,059
[SPEAKER_13]: It is on the city website.

790
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:20,408
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a lot of really big, beautiful lofty goals for how to evolve the Medford that we love today into the community that we're already striving to become.

791
01:14:21,029 --> 01:14:24,752
[SPEAKER_13]: And we know how much funding and resources those goals take to manifest.

792
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:25,573
[SPEAKER_13]: And so,

793
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:36,512
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's about time that we update this mechanism so that these large developers, the only ones that are targeted by linkage are paying their fair share.

794
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:37,973
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's really all that this is.

795
01:14:38,033 --> 01:14:48,775
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's heartening to know that some of this research was based on the city of Watertown, which in recent years, if anybody's gone down Arsenal Street, they've seen a huge development boom, heartening to see.

796
01:14:48,795 --> 01:14:55,757
[SPEAKER_13]: And I lost the second place that I was going with that font.

797
01:15:00,805 --> 01:15:07,807
[SPEAKER_13]: In terms of the developer experience, I think that, you know, this creates a highly predictable increase that developers can know about.

798
01:15:07,867 --> 01:15:09,727
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't have any fears attached to this.

799
01:15:09,767 --> 01:15:10,707
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm really glad that we're doing it.

800
01:15:10,747 --> 01:15:12,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Leming, for your leadership on it.

801
01:15:12,648 --> 01:15:17,769
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know that City Hall staff were very helpful in the research as well.

802
01:15:17,909 --> 01:15:19,090
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'll second the motion to approve.

803
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:23,091
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second the motion to approve by Councilor Leming, seconded by Vice President Collins.

804
01:15:23,131 --> 01:15:23,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion?

805
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:27,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

806
01:15:28,592 --> 01:15:29,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan?

807
01:15:29,513 --> 01:15:29,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro?

811
01:15:33,538 --> 01:15:33,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

812
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:35,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Ntuk?

813
01:15:35,421 --> 01:15:35,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

814
01:15:36,362 --> 01:15:37,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

815
01:15:37,203 --> 01:15:37,303
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

816
01:15:39,178 --> 01:15:40,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor San Buenaventura.

817
01:15:40,799 --> 01:15:41,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor San Buenaventura.

818
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:42,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor San Buenaventura.

819
01:15:42,921 --> 01:15:44,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor San Buenaventura.

820
01:15:44,982 --> 01:15:45,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor San Buenaventura.

821
01:15:45,782 --> 01:15:46,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor San Buenaventura.

822
01:15:46,983 --> 01:15:47,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor San Buenaventura.

823
01:15:47,844 --> 01:15:48,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor San Buenaventura.

824
01:16:06,493 --> 01:16:07,516
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Barras.

825
01:16:08,901 --> 01:16:12,111
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is a... We're at the...

826
01:16:12,864 --> 01:16:17,226
[SPEAKER_13]: culmination of an ordinance project that began last year in 2023.

827
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:34,632
[SPEAKER_13]: The idea for a wildlife feeding ordinance was first brought up to me by constituents who were kind of facing this problem firsthand, which I know many people in the city and other cities face, which is there's the wrong kind of animal on my property.

828
01:16:34,652 --> 01:16:36,113
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not a pet.

829
01:16:36,173 --> 01:16:37,133
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not domesticated.

830
01:16:37,173 --> 01:16:38,013
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want it here.

831
01:16:38,133 --> 01:16:38,874
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a nuisance.

832
01:16:38,974 --> 01:16:40,594
[SPEAKER_13]: It's potentially a health hazard.

833
01:16:42,055 --> 01:16:42,195
[SPEAKER_13]: And

834
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:56,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Part of the reason that it might be on private property in a residential area in an environment that is not appropriate for humans or for the animal is because there are wildlife attractants out, namely food sources for wildlife.

835
01:16:58,192 --> 01:17:04,293
[SPEAKER_13]: So I discussed this matter with our code enforcement officers, with our health director, Director O'Connor.

836
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:29,333
[SPEAKER_13]: with other city hall staff and received a lot of really helpful guidance on how to take a model of wildlife feeding ordinances from other cities and environments such as ours and create a mechanism so that city staff have a way to enforce around only inappropriate and problematic feeding of wildlife, the type of which is drawing wildlife.

837
01:17:30,555 --> 01:17:33,177
[SPEAKER_13]: animals that shouldn't be there onto residential areas.

838
01:17:33,438 --> 01:17:37,402
[SPEAKER_13]: What this is not is an ordinance that says you can't have a bird feeder.

839
01:17:37,562 --> 01:17:40,725
[SPEAKER_13]: We specifically say you can have a bird feeder.

840
01:17:40,745 --> 01:17:45,170
[SPEAKER_13]: The health director said we should put in language on there to make sure that bird feeders are

841
01:17:45,782 --> 01:17:49,863
[SPEAKER_13]: constructed properly, that they're not just squirrel feeding devices, because that's also a problem.

842
01:17:51,323 --> 01:17:53,704
[SPEAKER_13]: But this is not an anti-bird feeding ordinance.

843
01:17:54,124 --> 01:17:56,785
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not an anti-pet feeding ordinance.

844
01:17:57,865 --> 01:18:06,948
[SPEAKER_13]: The subcommittee on, or the Committee on Public Health and Community Safety really took its time with this ordinance to make sure that we thought through all the nuances and got the right language with advice from

845
01:18:08,228 --> 01:18:20,658
[SPEAKER_13]: legal counsel on how to make sure that this is targeted, just so that when there is problematic wildlife feeding going on the city has a mechanism to step in first to say, Hey, that's a problem.

846
01:18:21,398 --> 01:18:22,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Please clean up your act.

847
01:18:22,779 --> 01:18:29,084
[SPEAKER_13]: And then if the problem willfully persists to issue a ticket or a fine, and this is all towards the end of making sure that our

848
01:18:30,438 --> 01:18:38,181
[SPEAKER_13]: beautiful private residential spaces in Medford can stay safe for wildlife and also stay enjoyable for the people that live there.

849
01:18:39,362 --> 01:18:54,709
[SPEAKER_13]: So I welcome questions from members of the council, especially those that were not on the committee where this is discussed, but otherwise I would want to thank especially our code enforcement officers, building director and health director, Mary Ann O'Connor, most of all for their guidance and a motion for approval.

850
01:18:56,317 --> 01:19:00,399
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve first reading, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro, any further discussion?

851
01:19:01,892 --> 01:19:02,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng.

852
01:19:02,532 --> 01:19:06,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to quickly thank Vice President Collins for her hard work on this as well.

853
01:19:07,033 --> 01:19:15,955
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that our health department has been asking for for a while in response to the rodent problems that we've seen in our city.

854
01:19:15,975 --> 01:19:18,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we've held many a meeting about that.

855
01:19:18,075 --> 01:19:22,576
[SPEAKER_02]: We've held committee of the whole meetings about it as well.

856
01:19:22,936 --> 01:19:29,518
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that they've mentioned repeatedly as something that we can do as a city council to help tackle that problem, especially with winter coming.

857
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:31,483
[SPEAKER_02]: as you

858
01:19:33,099 --> 01:19:53,335
[SPEAKER_02]: referred to in subcommittee, in committee, we really paid a lot of attention to how can we make sure that this isn't punishing people for good behavior, for hobbies, for interests, but rather focusing on the public health aspect, on the quality of life aspect of the rodent problem.

859
01:19:53,435 --> 01:19:56,077
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this ordinance strikes a very good balance with that.

860
01:19:56,418 --> 01:20:01,902
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate the work that you especially have put into it and our city staff have put into this as well.

861
01:20:05,002 --> 01:20:27,580
[SPEAKER_08]: And just from the chair, just want to thank Vice President Collins as well between this and the work on the solid waste task force and our solid waste ordinances and the release of the solid waste plan and now focused on again now for our second pass at rodent control after the first pass at rodent control, which is obviously much needed with the wildlife feeding and overgrowth and amendments to the rodent control ordinance.

862
01:20:29,022 --> 01:20:43,503
[SPEAKER_08]: really from this council and in partnership with the city administration worked hard to put together a comprehensive approach to trying to keep this rodent problem out of our community and try to improve our waste practices and I think you've been essential to that and I really want to thank you for that.

863
01:20:44,952 --> 01:20:58,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, we have more work to do, and we're doing that with an incredibly limited set of resources and funds, which is really difficult, but trying to maximize what we can do given the limited staffing and limited funding is really impressive.

864
01:20:58,296 --> 01:20:58,996
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you very much.

865
01:21:00,176 --> 01:21:00,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion?

866
01:21:01,016 --> 01:21:08,578
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve the first reading, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

867
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:09,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

868
01:21:09,159 --> 01:21:10,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Schwerk, please call the roll.

869
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:13,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Kellogg?

870
01:21:15,851 --> 01:21:16,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Collins.

871
01:21:16,732 --> 01:21:16,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

872
01:21:18,013 --> 01:21:18,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro.

873
01:21:18,934 --> 01:21:19,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

874
01:21:19,814 --> 01:21:20,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Leming.

875
01:21:20,535 --> 01:21:20,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

876
01:21:21,355 --> 01:21:21,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

877
01:21:22,016 --> 01:21:22,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

878
01:21:23,858 --> 01:21:24,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Sanz.

879
01:21:24,718 --> 01:21:24,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

880
01:21:25,299 --> 01:21:25,899
[SPEAKER_05]: President Paris.

881
01:21:26,139 --> 01:21:26,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

882
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,541
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an affirmative, none the negative.

883
01:21:27,561 --> 01:21:28,681
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes.

884
01:21:29,922 --> 01:21:31,504
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll see that for third reading in a few weeks.

885
01:21:33,245 --> 01:21:37,789
[SPEAKER_08]: 24458 offered by Mayor Brianna Locurne, established an EV charging repawing fund.

886
01:21:39,226 --> 01:21:56,137
[SPEAKER_08]: dear president bears and members of the city council I respectfully request and recommend the city council approve the following amendment to chapter 2 article 5 division 4 of the city's ordinance by adopting the following change the table in section 2-964 authorizing revolving funds shall be amended to include an electric vehicle charging revolving fund as per the enclosed table

887
01:21:56,677 --> 01:22:03,839
[SPEAKER_08]: and close the letter from the Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability, Alicia Hunt, that outlines this request, as well as a memorandum that provides supporting documentation.

888
01:22:03,939 --> 01:22:16,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, I'm enclosing a memorandum by Finance Director Auditor, Bob Dickinson, that provides the necessary certification pursuant to Mass General Law, Chapter 44, Section 53E and a half for establishing a revolving fund in the middle of a fiscal year.

889
01:22:16,602 --> 01:22:21,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Climate Staff Planner, Brenda Pike, will be available to speak to this request and answer any questions that you may have.

890
01:22:21,163 --> 01:22:22,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

891
01:22:22,684 --> 01:22:24,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Sincerely, Brianna Lugo-Kern, Mayor.

892
01:22:25,984 --> 01:22:28,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Brenda, do you have a presentation or just wanna?

893
01:22:28,805 --> 01:22:31,146
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I just wanted to be available for questions.

894
01:22:31,166 --> 01:22:34,427
[SPEAKER_14]: So Brenda Pike, staff planner, Climate Policy.

895
01:22:35,687 --> 01:22:43,309
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm responsible for managing and for installing and the upkeep of the charging stations that the city owns.

896
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:44,910
[SPEAKER_14]: There are 11 right now.

897
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:51,512
[SPEAKER_14]: And usage has increased a lot in the last few years.

898
01:22:51,672 --> 01:22:54,973
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we would just like to set up this revolving fund so that we can use the

899
01:22:56,354 --> 01:23:06,217
[SPEAKER_14]: amount that drivers are paying to use these stations for electricity bills for the stations, more maintenance fees and other operating costs.

900
01:23:06,757 --> 01:23:14,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can see here from the charts provided that the kilowatt hours have gone up a lot and there's a projection for this year of doubling again.

901
01:23:14,659 --> 01:23:18,660
[SPEAKER_08]: And given that the city right now is not charging at all, right, it's a

902
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:22,841
[SPEAKER_08]: It's $0.25 right now and this would take us up to $0.35.

903
01:23:22,881 --> 01:23:26,982
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I will go to Councilor Callahan.

904
01:23:28,322 --> 01:23:43,705
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just curious if you have any predictions that if you raise it from $0.25 to $0.35, which based on your chart is one of the higher, is a little bit higher than surrounding cities, do you think that that will lead to fewer people charging in Medford or

905
01:23:44,574 --> 01:23:56,243
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't anticipate that based on studies that I've seen showing that electric vehicle drivers tend to be inelastic in their choices.

906
01:23:58,665 --> 01:24:08,092
[SPEAKER_14]: And there is always the option to charge at home, both with level one chargers or level two chargers that they have installed themselves.

907
01:24:09,193 --> 01:24:09,453
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

908
01:24:11,101 --> 01:24:12,163
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for coming here.

909
01:24:12,183 --> 01:24:14,526
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really excited about the program in general.

910
01:24:14,867 --> 01:24:17,751
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm happy to see that there has been increasing demand.

911
01:24:18,092 --> 01:24:18,893
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that's a good sign.

912
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:25,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Council President.

913
01:24:25,526 --> 01:24:26,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for all your work.

914
01:24:26,826 --> 01:24:36,771
[SPEAKER_06]: I think these are the revenue generating projects that we're talking about and that the city can really use.

915
01:24:36,851 --> 01:24:38,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And like we said, we're starting with one.

916
01:24:39,773 --> 01:24:52,700
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we see it starting to increase, I think it'll be important that we stay ahead of the kilowatt rate for the fact that we're seeing national grid never saw us

917
01:24:53,629 --> 01:24:56,211
[SPEAKER_06]: They're climbing at an outrageous rate.

918
01:24:56,311 --> 01:25:07,139
[SPEAKER_06]: So in making sure that we're competitive, but at the same time, we're offering something for convenience for our residents and

919
01:25:08,134 --> 01:25:19,797
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest with you, I'm sure the gaps that people that are driving down 93 that need a charge, the nearest site comes right into Medford, right off the highway, and they use our station.

920
01:25:19,877 --> 01:25:28,159
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wouldn't mind that someone from a different community, a different state that needs to be charged, they come into Medford and help us with our bills.

921
01:25:28,199 --> 01:25:29,119
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you so much.

922
01:25:29,859 --> 01:25:31,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Spadafore, Vice President Collins.

923
01:25:33,328 --> 01:25:37,011
[SPEAKER_13]: to thank you so much for all of your work on this program and so many other initiatives.

924
01:25:37,872 --> 01:25:48,661
[SPEAKER_13]: It's great to see Medford beginning to give, you know, our climate and climate adjacent policies the priority that they really deserve and that, you know, our residents deserve and that we need.

925
01:25:50,323 --> 01:25:56,548
[SPEAKER_13]: It's great to see that we're, you know, taking a really granular look at our EB program and say, you know, we need to make sure that this

926
01:25:58,389 --> 01:26:09,554
[SPEAKER_13]: program, you know, kind of reaches that flywheel effect where we are getting the revenue that we need to expand it further and make it ever more easy and convenient to drive an EV in or through Medford.

927
01:26:10,654 --> 01:26:12,575
[SPEAKER_13]: So I really appreciate seeing this before us tonight.

928
01:26:12,595 --> 01:26:14,455
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much for your work and I'd motion for approval.

929
01:26:15,876 --> 01:26:18,977
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion to approve for first reading by Vice President Cohn, seconded by.

930
01:26:19,237 --> 01:26:20,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.

931
01:26:21,418 --> 01:26:22,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a public participation?

932
01:26:22,758 --> 01:26:23,719
[SPEAKER_08]: I see Mr. Fiore.

933
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:26,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like to speak on this paper?

934
01:26:34,992 --> 01:26:35,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, my apologies.

935
01:26:35,853 --> 01:26:36,753
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't see you.

936
01:26:36,773 --> 01:26:37,894
[SPEAKER_08]: We were just voting.

937
01:26:51,182 --> 01:26:53,083
[SPEAKER_08]: The rule doesn't speak to that either way.

938
01:26:54,304 --> 01:26:59,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Generally, I look for a hand on Zoom or someone standing here at the podium or waiting for the podium.

939
01:27:01,529 --> 01:27:01,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

940
01:27:04,403 --> 01:27:07,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion on the EV charging station?

941
01:27:09,684 --> 01:27:14,085

956
01:27:31,772 --> 01:27:32,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, 70 affirmative and negative.

957
01:27:32,953 --> 01:27:33,673
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes.

958
01:27:33,733 --> 01:27:34,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

959
01:27:34,634 --> 01:27:35,754
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you, Director Dickinson.

960
01:27:36,495 --> 01:27:36,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

961
01:27:36,875 --> 01:27:43,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I also add while we're on this topic that we're going to have an EV showcase here at City Hall this Saturday from 10 to 12.

962
01:27:44,078 --> 01:27:51,722
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll have drivers with their vehicles here so you can talk to them about the pros and cons of owning an electric vehicle.

963
01:27:52,183 --> 01:27:52,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Brenda.

964
01:27:54,642 --> 01:28:00,268
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, 24460 offered, submitted by Mayor Brian O'Connor, refunding loan order request.

965
01:28:00,949 --> 01:28:03,251
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a prematurely thank you, Bob.

966
01:28:03,271 --> 01:28:03,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about that.

967
01:28:06,107 --> 01:28:12,952
[SPEAKER_08]: We have here, dear President Bears and members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following loan order.

968
01:28:13,532 --> 01:28:31,364
[SPEAKER_08]: City of Medford loan order water bonds, be it ordered that in order to reduce interest costs, the treasurer with the approval of the mayor is authorized to provide for the sale and issuance of refunding bonds pursuant to chapter 44, section 21A of the general laws or pursuant to any other enabling authority at one time or from time to time to refund any or all portions of the city's general obligation bonds outstanding

969
01:28:31,884 --> 01:28:56,222
[SPEAKER_08]: as of the date of adoption of this order, and that the proceeds of the refunding bonds issued pursuant to this order shall be used to pay the principal redemption premium and interest on the bonds of the city to be refunded, and cost of issuance of the refunding bonds, and that the treasurer is authorized to execute such documents as may be necessary or desirable to carry out this transaction, including one or more refunding trust agreements with a bank or trust company, and further order that the treasurer is authorized to file an application

970
01:28:56,722 --> 01:29:16,668
[SPEAKER_08]: with the appropriate officials of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Commonwealth to qualify under Chapter 44A of the general laws, any and all bonds of the city authorized to be borrowed pursuant to this loan order, and to provide such information and execute such documents as such officials of the Commonwealth may require in connection therewith, Finance Director Auditor Bob Dickinson will be prepared, present to answer questions on this matter.

971
01:29:16,688 --> 01:29:19,188
[SPEAKER_08]: We respectfully submit it to the Mayor.

972
01:29:19,709 --> 01:29:20,409
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have

973
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:32,883
[SPEAKER_08]: in accordance with the provisions of Medford City Council Rule 30 from KP Law, we have examined the above captioned loan order as to its legality and respectfully transmit this letter of notification of our findings.

974
01:29:33,484 --> 01:29:40,593
[SPEAKER_08]: In opinion, the loan order in which an authorization is sought to refund any or all portion of the city's outstanding general obligation bonds as of the date of the loan order

975
01:29:41,113 --> 01:30:04,973
[SPEAKER_08]: including the payment of the principal redemption premium and interest on the bonds of the city to be refunded and the cost of issuance of refunding bonds is in proper form and further such refunding bonds are authorized pursuant to section 21a of chapter 44 of the general laws as amended the loan order properly grants the treasurer with the approval of the mayor the authority to issue such refunding bonds of the city and duly authorizes the city to qualify said refunding bonds pursuant to chapter 44a of the general laws as amended

976
01:30:05,834 --> 01:30:08,656
[SPEAKER_08]: It is also understood the city's bond council prepared and reviewed the loan order.

977
01:30:08,756 --> 01:30:09,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

978
01:30:09,437 --> 01:30:11,038
[SPEAKER_08]: And please let us know if you have any questions.

979
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:26,509
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have here, I think I just, in a very long winded way, we have a paper here that the city would like to reduce interest counts by refunding and potentially reissuing bonds and that you require this loan order to do so.

980
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:33,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, basically this allows the city to have the flexibility when interest rates

981
01:30:35,724 --> 01:30:43,446
[SPEAKER_07]: are favorable and we can actually call bonds that we have issued and get savings from it.

982
01:30:43,486 --> 01:30:48,987
[SPEAKER_07]: This puts in place legislatively our ability to simply do that.

983
01:30:50,128 --> 01:30:55,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Our bond council and their bond issuers

984
01:30:57,978 --> 01:31:07,521
[SPEAKER_07]: people that we work with, Phil Topper, Senator McInerney, and Abby Jeffers, keep an eye on the market, and they keep an eye on the debt that we have outstanding.

985
01:31:08,181 --> 01:31:26,506
[SPEAKER_07]: In this case, they brought up that there's some debt that we have from 2011, 2012, 2013, that is now callable, because it's 20-year debt, it's been out for 10 years, we can call all that debt, reissue that debt, and actually save money, save money over the next 10 years on the payment of that debt.

986
01:31:27,566 --> 01:31:31,114
[SPEAKER_07]: So depending on market conditions, sometimes it just makes sense to do that.

987
01:31:31,134 --> 01:31:33,118
[SPEAKER_07]: In this case, it probably does.

988
01:31:33,218 --> 01:31:38,068
[SPEAKER_07]: So this allows the city the flexibility to do that when the conditions warn it.

989
01:31:39,892 --> 01:31:40,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Director Dickinson.

990
01:31:40,852 --> 01:31:41,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

991
01:31:41,693 --> 01:31:42,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Spadafore.

992
01:31:42,433 --> 01:31:42,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

993
01:31:43,134 --> 01:31:46,175
[SPEAKER_06]: This is common practice, by the way.

994
01:31:46,655 --> 01:31:47,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Every municipality does this.

995
01:31:47,936 --> 01:31:50,117
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's good practice.

996
01:31:51,518 --> 01:31:54,219
[SPEAKER_07]: I would guess that in the past, Medford has done this before.

997
01:31:54,299 --> 01:31:55,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have.

998
01:31:55,060 --> 01:32:00,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure that we've got this in place so we can get it to Hilltop and they can get it to Barnhill.

999
01:32:00,242 --> 01:32:01,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, I think that's a great idea.

1000
01:32:02,803 --> 01:32:06,125
[SPEAKER_06]: For people to understand, I think that someone asked me a question, what does that mean, George?

1001
01:32:06,145 --> 01:32:07,626
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that, simply put,

1002
01:32:08,426 --> 01:32:17,370
[SPEAKER_06]: you had your mortgage and it extended so long, you can revisit it with a better rate and rewrite that.

1003
01:32:17,871 --> 01:32:19,271
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's that simple.

1004
01:32:25,094 --> 01:32:28,699
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're talking about bonds, it's a lot of money if we could save a percentage point.

1005
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:30,682
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I think this is good work.

1006
01:32:30,762 --> 01:32:39,333
[SPEAKER_07]: This one going forward would probably be on the order of, I'd have to really go through all the figures because I always check them, but $40,000 to $50,000 for the next 10 years.

1007
01:32:39,373 --> 01:32:39,914
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a teacher.

1008
01:32:43,258 --> 01:32:46,460
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a teacher for the next 10 years or a police officer or a firefighter.

1009
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,981
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's great.

1010
01:32:48,121 --> 01:32:52,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate you had worked with that and I would support this, Mr. President.

1011
01:32:52,643 --> 01:32:52,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1012
01:32:53,544 --> 01:32:53,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1013
01:32:54,004 --> 01:32:55,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion?

1014
01:32:55,965 --> 01:32:57,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Council Vice President Collins.

1015
01:32:57,966 --> 01:32:59,587
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for putting this together.

1016
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:00,788
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm looking for approval.

1017
01:33:02,549 --> 01:33:02,829
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1018
01:33:03,609 --> 01:33:06,991
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion for approval, do you have a discussion question?

1019
01:33:07,491 --> 01:33:08,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Councilor Callahan.

1020
01:33:09,505 --> 01:33:17,329
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a question, is this out of the Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund or is this out of the, these bonds, are those the bonds that we see coming out of the operating budget?

1021
01:33:18,029 --> 01:33:28,653
[SPEAKER_07]: The ones that we are looking at right now are high school science, DPWER is 75% operating general fund and 25% Water and Sewer Enterprise.

1022
01:33:42,833 --> 01:33:44,254
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe the microphone is on.

1023
01:33:44,694 --> 01:33:45,895
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just too tall.

1024
01:33:48,256 --> 01:33:48,857
[SPEAKER_08]: It's working.

1025
01:33:49,517 --> 01:33:49,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

1026
01:33:50,278 --> 01:33:50,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Bob.

1027
01:33:50,818 --> 01:33:53,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna bring my own microphone.

1028
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,561
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna get them replaced soon, but you might wanna, yeah.

1029
01:33:57,282 --> 01:33:59,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Shane's about to yell at you for touching the thing too.

1030
01:33:59,924 --> 01:34:00,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we are, okay.

1031
01:34:02,645 --> 01:34:03,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that better?

1032
01:34:03,166 --> 01:34:05,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, thank you for recognizing that.

1033
01:34:05,327 --> 01:34:07,388
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be right over there, you can ask me any question you'd like.

1034
01:34:09,349 --> 01:34:09,970
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that's,

1035
01:34:12,031 --> 01:34:15,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, where were we?

1036
01:34:15,594 --> 01:34:18,456
[SPEAKER_07]: 75% general fund, 25% water sewer fund.

1037
01:34:18,496 --> 01:34:24,981
[SPEAKER_07]: So a little bit on that one issuance, a little bit of that savings would go to water sewer.

1038
01:34:25,461 --> 01:34:26,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful, thank you.

1039
01:34:27,403 --> 01:34:30,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, and so yeah, this would apply to all bonds out of any funds?

1040
01:34:31,846 --> 01:34:37,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's three, well, it's actually five different issuances that are all 20 year.

1041
01:34:39,964 --> 01:34:43,927
[SPEAKER_07]: 20 year money that were issued in 2011 through 2013 that we're paying back.

1042
01:34:44,728 --> 01:34:54,516
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, is, is this, I guess my question is more, does this provide the city, the authority and perpetuity to conduct this process or only for these bonds?

1043
01:34:55,336 --> 01:35:04,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, this is for any bonds when we, and we just need to make sure we have it on file somewhere that we actually adopted this and can't find it if we did it before.

1044
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:11,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, DPW yard, fire trucks, high school pool, and the high school science lab.

1045
01:35:12,943 --> 01:35:16,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are all the ones that we're refunding, that they're talking about refunding right now.

1046
01:35:16,544 --> 01:35:30,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, you know, this just gives us the authority that if, you know, if the Fed, it gets complicated, because you want to, you want to try to guess what the Fed is going to do, which of course, it's, I don't have a crystal ball.

1047
01:35:30,529 --> 01:35:31,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Half a point maybe.

1048
01:35:33,230 --> 01:35:43,357
[SPEAKER_07]: next year, for instance, interest rates are low, and we have outstanding debt that is now callable because it's 10 years old, then it may be good to do this again.

1049
01:35:43,377 --> 01:35:47,420
[SPEAKER_07]: And depending on market conditions, save the city more money.

1050
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:49,181
[SPEAKER_08]: But you wouldn't need to come back to us.

1051
01:35:49,281 --> 01:35:50,482
[SPEAKER_07]: But we would not need to come back.

1052
01:35:50,522 --> 01:35:50,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

1053
01:35:52,263 --> 01:35:53,404
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, on the motion.

1054
01:35:53,684 --> 01:35:57,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Does this require multiple readings?

1055
01:35:57,987 --> 01:35:59,688
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's an amendment to the ordinances.

1056
01:36:04,364 --> 01:36:05,024
[SPEAKER_04]: One second.

1057
01:36:06,845 --> 01:36:07,446
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so.

1058
01:36:10,548 --> 01:36:10,748
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1059
01:36:11,908 --> 01:36:17,051
[SPEAKER_08]: On a motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli to approve, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1060
01:36:18,672 --> 01:36:19,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Cowdery?

1061
01:36:19,392 --> 01:36:19,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1062
01:36:20,333 --> 01:36:21,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Collins?

1063
01:36:21,333 --> 01:36:21,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1064
01:36:21,994 --> 01:36:22,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1065
01:36:22,954 --> 01:36:23,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1066
01:36:23,715 --> 01:36:24,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Leming?

1067
01:36:24,375 --> 01:36:24,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1068
01:36:25,176 --> 01:36:25,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1069
01:36:27,438 --> 01:36:27,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Second, yes.

1070
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:28,679
[SPEAKER_05]: President Ferris.

1071
01:36:28,959 --> 01:36:29,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1072
01:36:30,220 --> 01:36:32,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Senator Ferman, then I give the motion passes.

1073
01:36:32,202 --> 01:36:34,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I did miss Mr. Fury.

1074
01:36:34,864 --> 01:36:36,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Would someone call public participation?

1075
01:36:37,787 --> 01:36:38,167
[SPEAKER_03]: So moved.

1076
01:36:38,487 --> 01:36:43,031
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Leming to open up public participation, seconded by Vice President Collins.

1077
01:36:43,491 --> 01:36:44,072
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1078
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:45,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed?

1079
01:36:45,053 --> 01:36:45,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

1080
01:36:46,154 --> 01:36:47,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'm sorry about that.

1081
01:36:47,114 --> 01:36:53,380
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to speak to the items that I missed you on prior, the floor is yours and I'll give you six minutes since I missed you twice.

1082
01:36:57,484 --> 01:37:00,647
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll start by the most important one, I think.

1083
01:37:00,687 --> 01:37:08,316
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't see the wildlife feeding ordinance as actually being too nice to people trying to do good things.

1084
01:37:08,997 --> 01:37:14,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, for example, someone even complained about fruit trees on the previous meeting related to rats.

1085
01:37:15,504 --> 01:37:17,326
[SPEAKER_10]: So here the ordinance says

1086
01:37:19,178 --> 01:37:27,124
[SPEAKER_10]: depositing directly or in feed or feeding shall mean the act of distributing, scattering, placing, exposing, or depositing directly or indirectly.

1087
01:37:27,424 --> 01:37:35,851
[SPEAKER_10]: So what does it mean, for example, I have fruit trees on my yard, and then a fruit happens to fall, or even if it doesn't fall, like these rodents can climb stuff.

1088
01:37:36,471 --> 01:37:38,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I actually indirectly feeding wildlife?

1089
01:37:39,133 --> 01:37:44,718
[SPEAKER_10]: What happens if I have an oak tree and I have a bunch of acorns, like I get tons of squirrels, is that indirectly feeding wildlife?

1090
01:37:45,159 --> 01:37:53,786
[SPEAKER_10]: What about if I'm trying to restitute soil health in my yard and I'm actually sowing cover crops to increase soil health?

1091
01:37:54,647 --> 01:37:56,629
[SPEAKER_10]: What happens in the three to week

1092
01:37:57,930 --> 01:38:01,432
[SPEAKER_10]: in a couple of weeks until I get germination of those seeds and something comes up.

1093
01:38:01,532 --> 01:38:03,953
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually that directly feeding wildlife.

1094
01:38:04,413 --> 01:38:07,415
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not sure that this is actually very well written.

1095
01:38:07,455 --> 01:38:10,516
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's up to the interpretation of whoever is enforcing this ordinance.

1096
01:38:10,917 --> 01:38:23,543
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm very concerned that residents trying to do something good for their soil, for the environment, avoiding having a lawn like everyone else has, this could be bad for them.

1097
01:38:25,564 --> 01:38:26,445
[SPEAKER_08]: pause there for a second.

1098
01:38:26,485 --> 01:38:27,547
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw Councilor Collins.

1099
01:38:27,567 --> 01:38:28,568
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm saving your time.

1100
01:38:28,949 --> 01:38:30,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins, have you had a response?

1101
01:38:30,350 --> 01:38:36,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Gaston, if you're interested, I'm happy to share a little bit of the thought that went into this ordinance if you totally hear you.

1102
01:38:37,019 --> 01:38:42,726
[SPEAKER_13]: This was kind of the main question that we were keeping in mind when we were crafting this, because for me,

1103
01:38:44,204 --> 01:38:57,372
[SPEAKER_13]: The goal is to have an enforcement mechanism for when accidental feeding is going awry without saying, hey, this benevolent thing that you're doing that isn't currently causing a problem, we don't wanna penalize that stuff.

1104
01:38:57,412 --> 01:39:07,958
[SPEAKER_13]: So we worked hard to phrase this in such a way under prohibited activity, that section, to say there's no violation occurring until a problem occurs.

1105
01:39:08,478 --> 01:39:11,039
[SPEAKER_13]: So for example, if there's a fruit tree, if there's fruit on the ground,

1106
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:21,046
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's not attracting wildlife at such a level where anybody's ever gonna notice or file a complaint, then it's not in violation of the ordinance.

1107
01:39:21,066 --> 01:39:22,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that make sense?

1108
01:39:22,487 --> 01:39:25,489
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's happening and it's not problematic, it's not in violation.

1109
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:38,579
[SPEAKER_13]: If there's a problem going on and the board of health director or the court enforcement offer or the animal control officer visits and says, yikes, this is causing some problems, then if it's not ameliorated, it's a violation.

1110
01:39:38,779 --> 01:39:40,500
[SPEAKER_13]: If that doesn't occur, it's not a violation.

1111
01:39:41,297 --> 01:39:42,018
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just offer that.

1112
01:39:43,779 --> 01:39:44,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for the clarification.

1113
01:39:45,381 --> 01:39:45,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1114
01:39:46,442 --> 01:39:46,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1115
01:39:47,263 --> 01:39:47,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1116
01:39:47,803 --> 01:39:48,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, that helps.

1117
01:39:48,704 --> 01:39:50,146
[SPEAKER_10]: So in the interest of time.

1118
01:39:50,166 --> 01:39:51,027
[SPEAKER_10]: The floor is yours.

1119
01:39:51,607 --> 01:39:51,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1120
01:39:51,927 --> 01:39:59,695
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, so regarding the linkage fee, so I think it's, so first of all, so this means that we are adding a fee.

1121
01:40:02,017 --> 01:40:19,155
[SPEAKER_08]: linkage fee right so one related to the affordable housing trust in addition to the four other ones this tonight no this tonight was just that the city has the authority to update i think there is an intent to add a fifth bucket as authorized by the legislation but that would have to happen through an ordinance separate from this

1122
01:40:19,275 --> 01:40:37,501
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I also had a question, why CPI versus, for example, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, which is like the PCE price index, or even something more specific related to, so I don't know exactly, I'd have to read about it, unfortunately, but you know exactly how the Affordable Housing Justice is gonna be used, but it's a linkage here, right?

1123
01:40:37,521 --> 01:40:41,583
[SPEAKER_10]: So it has to be linked to whatever, to where you're collecting, to whatever you're gonna be used it for.

1124
01:40:42,643 --> 01:40:49,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Why, for example, a basket of inflation goods that are related to whatever that affordable housing trust money is going to be used for?

1125
01:40:49,673 --> 01:40:51,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Why CPI?

1126
01:40:51,275 --> 01:40:52,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not BCE?

1127
01:40:52,436 --> 01:40:53,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not something else?

1128
01:40:56,584 --> 01:41:03,431
[SPEAKER_03]: So when determining whether or not something will get through the state house, oftentimes you're reading the tea leaves.

1129
01:41:03,691 --> 01:41:11,700
[SPEAKER_03]: But in this case, it was solely because they had already approved similar language with that same price index for the city of Watertown.

1130
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:12,961
[SPEAKER_03]: So they

1131
01:41:14,122 --> 01:41:17,586
[SPEAKER_03]: the state legislature would want consistency going on there.

1132
01:41:17,626 --> 01:41:26,096
[SPEAKER_03]: There wouldn't really be much of a reason for the city of Watertown to go for one price index and then Medford to just arbitrarily choose another.

1133
01:41:26,257 --> 01:41:31,963
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the justification behind that particular choice right there.

1134
01:41:34,847 --> 01:41:41,350
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of the Affordable Housing Trust, as Council President Barrett said, that is independent of any votes that took place tonight.

1135
01:41:41,410 --> 01:41:52,374
[SPEAKER_03]: This was solely, the vote here was solely to ask the state to extend the period between these very expensive studies from three years to 10 years to save the city.

1136
01:41:53,334 --> 01:42:06,976
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit of money, and also to allow for automatic adjustments to be applied for these, because right now, I think that when they instituted this, they assumed that the cities would just do these studies every three years, and Medford in practice just never did that.

1137
01:42:07,016 --> 01:42:08,657
[SPEAKER_03]: We're supposed to, we never did.

1138
01:42:09,437 --> 01:42:15,238
[SPEAKER_03]: So this just allows a mechanism to prevent that, those fees from being eaten up by inflation.

1139
01:42:15,678 --> 01:42:19,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now they're worth less than half of what they were in 1990.

1140
01:42:22,359 --> 01:42:28,081
[SPEAKER_03]: The affordable housing trust fund, sorry, the affordable housing trust linkage program.

1141
01:42:28,101 --> 01:42:38,065
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is, there is currently a draft that essentially establishes a fifth bucket in addition to the four that currently exist to go into the affordable housing trust.

1142
01:42:38,365 --> 01:42:42,886
[SPEAKER_03]: The affordable housing trust was already created by this council in the previous term.

1143
01:42:43,487 --> 01:42:48,989
[SPEAKER_03]: And the state, the language of the state ordinance also allows for

1144
01:42:50,630 --> 01:42:53,772
[SPEAKER_03]: also allows for affordable housing to be one of those buckets.

1145
01:42:53,812 --> 01:43:00,377
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially all the ordinance would do is create a chain there that puts money into the bucket.

1146
01:43:04,698 --> 01:43:21,091
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is that in order to do that, you do need another completely new study, which would cost about $80,000 in order to figure out what exactly the amount of money that you're charging developers to go into the Affordable Housing Trust would be in the first place.

1147
01:43:21,131 --> 01:43:30,499
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now, I've been working with the planning office to figure out how to fund that study, what the study would look like, and just generally corresponding with them.

1148
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:38,307
[SPEAKER_03]: In all likelihood, we wouldn't actually pass the ordinance until the study were conducted.

1149
01:43:38,727 --> 01:43:45,754
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, we would have a bit more of a basis for it, but I could talk for a while about the whole situation there.

1150
01:43:46,195 --> 01:43:47,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for clarification.

1151
01:43:47,096 --> 01:43:53,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Just the last thing is like, so it does make sense to have linkage fees, because obviously, you know, you add density and then

1152
01:43:54,463 --> 01:43:58,254
[SPEAKER_10]: they require more resources so it does make sense to have funding for all of that.

1153
01:43:58,555 --> 01:44:01,243
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just concerned that you know we also have to look

1154
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:11,285
[SPEAKER_10]: holistically, kind of what Councilor Caput was saying in the sense of like, so if this increases costs for the developer, then that cost is gonna be passed on to the consumer.

1155
01:44:11,325 --> 01:44:24,593
[SPEAKER_10]: In this case, like, you know, whoever either, you know, buys that property, because I read the chapter 94, section 10, and it also applies to residential buildings of more than, I think it was like more than six units or something like that.

1156
01:44:24,973 --> 01:44:26,494
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and commercial, obviously.

1157
01:44:26,554 --> 01:44:30,557
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just concerned that, you know, we don't look at this holistically.

1158
01:44:31,698 --> 01:44:32,218
[SPEAKER_10]: potentially.

1159
01:44:32,919 --> 01:44:38,283
[SPEAKER_10]: We could be increasing costs to developers in such a way that then they will be passed on to the consumer.

1160
01:44:38,483 --> 01:44:46,729
[SPEAKER_10]: And so as long as, you know, when the time comes and we examine all those potential problems and we look at the trade-offs, then I think it works.

1161
01:44:46,889 --> 01:44:52,053
[SPEAKER_03]: So the point of doing these studies is that this can be looked at holistically.

1162
01:44:52,113 --> 01:44:54,134
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason that we're not just

1163
01:44:55,995 --> 01:45:02,459
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason that you don't just kind of arbitrarily come up with a number is because those situations might occur in the first place.

1164
01:45:02,519 --> 01:45:22,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, the planning office is trying to come up with funding to do a more comprehensive study on the other four buckets as well, just so that these situations don't actually happen, because you're right, you do need to account for a lot of other things, including what the city is already doing, the current costs of materials, labor,

1165
01:45:23,551 --> 01:45:24,432
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera, et cetera.

1166
01:45:24,472 --> 01:45:29,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that is the purpose of doing one of these, uh, one of these studies in the first place.

1167
01:45:29,796 --> 01:45:33,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, the city hasn't done one in 34 years, so we really need to do one.

1168
01:45:33,738 --> 01:45:35,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1169
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:40,423
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a fan of the, uh, IPD as a price deflator.

1170
01:45:41,043 --> 01:45:47,448
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, if we want to get into that, I will say this as a home rule petition, if, um,

1171
01:45:48,428 --> 01:46:02,995
[SPEAKER_08]: if the legislature were to be so kind as to deign to offer this council the authority to consider other price deflators, they could amend the Home Rule petition that we submitted, Representative Donato, Senator Jalen, Barbara, Representative Garberly, if they wanted to just say,

1172
01:46:03,775 --> 01:46:10,197
[SPEAKER_08]: the price deflator chosen by the city council and the mayor or something like that, that would be possible.

1173
01:46:10,237 --> 01:46:16,880
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do appreciate Councilor Leming's approach, which is if they passed it before, maybe they'll pass it again, which is a rarity.

1174
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:22,142
[SPEAKER_08]: They only passed eight laws this term, so sometimes a little tough.

1175
01:46:22,762 --> 01:46:29,128
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I'm an IPD fan because that's about that's the price bucket for state and local government relative constant GDP.

1176
01:46:29,169 --> 01:46:37,937
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's actually what we should be using, because it's the stuff that cities buy versus what people buy, which is a little different, but we can avoid that.

1177
01:46:37,977 --> 01:46:39,038
[SPEAKER_08]: And it looks like everybody's bored.

1178
01:46:39,198 --> 01:46:45,285
[SPEAKER_08]: So on behalf of the residents, please, please stop.

1179
01:46:48,533 --> 01:46:50,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to adjourn.

1180
01:46:51,155 --> 01:46:53,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, here's what he has.

1181
01:46:53,457 --> 01:46:57,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a motion of council member to adjourn seconded by Councilor Keohane.

1182
01:46:57,601 --> 01:46:58,341
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1183
01:46:58,641 --> 01:46:58,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1184
01:46:58,862 --> 01:46:59,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed?

1185
01:46:59,162 --> 01:47:00,303
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes, the meeting is adjourned.
