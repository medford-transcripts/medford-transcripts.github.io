1
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:02,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2
00:00:02,973 --> 00:00:21,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law, General Law Chapter 38, Section 18, and the Governor's March 15, 2020 order imposing strict limitation on the number of people that may gather in one place, this meeting of the Memphis City Council will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible.

3
00:00:22,663 --> 00:00:35,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Specific information and the general guidelines for remote participation by members of the public and or parties with a right and or requirement to attend this meeting can be found on the City of Medford website at www.medfordma.org.

[SPEAKER_10]: No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings in real time via technological means.

6
00:00:53,237 --> 00:01:06,303
[SPEAKER_10]: In the event that we are unable to do so, despite best efforts, we will post on the City of Meffitt or Meffitt Community Media website an audio or video recording transcript or other comprehensive record of proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting.

7
00:01:06,323 --> 00:01:10,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I just wanted to,

8
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:15,043
[SPEAKER_10]: just make a quick statement regarding these meetings here.

9
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:23,457
[SPEAKER_10]: So last week we had a Committee of the Whole meeting at City Council Chambers, and the public was able to access the meeting via Zoom.

10
00:01:24,238 --> 00:01:28,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight, the council members are back home, accessing the meeting via Zoom.

11
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:39,467
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason why we are doing this from home tonight is we have early voting this week in City Hall, and I know Clerk Hurtubise has been working hard at that since Saturday.

12
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:41,728
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that's been taking up most of his time.

13
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,332
[SPEAKER_10]: They have the tabulation machines behind the rails and they would have to move everything.

14
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:54,117
[SPEAKER_10]: So this should be, uh, hopefully the last time that the council has to log in from their homes and we can do it, uh, in council chambers.

15
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:56,799
[SPEAKER_10]: The council can meet in council chambers going forward.

16
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, and so that is the plan, but I just wanted to explain that before we get started.

17
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:06,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, Mr. President, I call for suspension of the rules to take a paper out of order.

18
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:13,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, on the motion of Council of Marks to suspend the rules, seconded by?

[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

39
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,420
[SPEAKER_11]: I ask that we take paper 20-521 out of order.

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:43,460
[SPEAKER_11]: 20-521.

41
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,612
[SPEAKER_10]: 20-521 offered by Councilor Marks.

42
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:59,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the sidewalks on Judson Circle be replaced in the interest of public safety.

43
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:00,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks.

44
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:17,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank You mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for taking this out of order We have a number of residents from Dutton Circle Underneath a blue tent tonight on their front lawn as we can see them all waving And I'd like to speak on their behalf.

45
00:03:17,505 --> 00:03:21,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President regarding an issue that took place back in 2017 when residents woke up to a

46
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:33,194
[SPEAKER_11]: national grid cutting down two trees apparently that were interfering with high tension wires on the street.

47
00:03:34,035 --> 00:03:50,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Shortly after that, Mr. President, the city came by and ripped out two stumps and then set forms to pour new cement sidewalks because the city ripped up about 150 feet of sidewalk along Dutton Circle.

48
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:53,410
[SPEAKER_11]: And this was not at the request of the residents.

49
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,572
[SPEAKER_11]: It was because of the work done by National Grid, the safety work that was done by National Grid.

50
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:07,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Fast forward almost three years later, the residents are still waiting to get the sidewalk poured in cement.

51
00:04:07,476 --> 00:04:10,279
[SPEAKER_11]: The farms are still there on the street from 2017.

52
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:18,268
[SPEAKER_11]: There are raised water shutoff valves that are causing a trip and fall hazard.

53
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:21,712
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mr. President, I received a call about

54
00:04:22,353 --> 00:04:28,995
[SPEAKER_11]: It's probably about three hours ago from Commissioner Kerins and Highway Director Steve Tanaglia.

55
00:04:29,655 --> 00:04:46,839
[SPEAKER_11]: And they assured me tonight, Mr. President, and they were out there today mocking off the sidewalk, that the residents on Dutton Circle, the long-awaited three years for these sidewalks that they were promised by the previous administration, will now be poured very shortly, Mr. President.

56
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,282
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to thank the residents of Dutton Circle for their patience on this.

57
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:59,948
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank the city administration for moving in a quick manner on this administration, moving in a quick manner.

58
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:06,233
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to thank Commissioner Kearns and Steve Tanaglia for their due diligence on this.

59
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:14,479
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there are a few residents, Mr. President, I know Emily's on, that would probably just like to speak briefly to the council, if you would indulge.

60
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:15,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you, Councilor Marks.

112
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:08,633
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you have to move to take the paper while you're under suspension already, or can you just take it because you're under suspension?

113
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:11,093
[SPEAKER_19]: We're under suspension, so we can take the paper.

114
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:13,794

118

00:11:06,918 --> 00:11:09,558
[SPEAKER_18]: There's also a fee structure that's in place that would

142
00:11:09,898 --> 00:11:14,920
[SPEAKER_18]: provide that would be put into a revolving account, which is also being created by the proposed measure.

143
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:36,608
[SPEAKER_18]: The purpose of which would be to support rodent mitigation and other measures that directly work towards mitigating rodents, rats, mice throughout the community as the result of any number of issues and whether not just construction, but also we all know that rats and other vermin

144
00:11:37,088 --> 00:11:42,210
[SPEAKER_18]: they thrive where there's water and there's food, and we need to try to do that in a densely populated area.

145
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:48,512
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is a pretty, we view this as a pretty progressive and aggressive way in order to do that.

146
00:11:49,232 --> 00:12:00,436
[SPEAKER_18]: And we look forward to having a conversation with the council and the community at large to put the measure forward in order to address the multiple items that were put forth by the council and the community in recent times.

147
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:03,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Chief of Staff Rodriguez, Councilor Pierce.

148
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:07,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

149
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:11,550
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you to my fellow counselors for many of you for bringing this issue up.

150
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have a couple of questions, Dave.

151
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:21,259
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of the fee structure, how did you arrive at the amounts that you arrived at?

152
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:23,982
[SPEAKER_05]: And is there an estimate of how much this might raise over a year?

153
00:12:24,002 --> 00:12:29,167
[SPEAKER_18]: We tried to do it as fairly as possible.

154
00:12:29,638 --> 00:12:35,981
[SPEAKER_18]: And this was a conversation that the mayor rolled up her sleeves personally and really dove in with Maryann O'Connor and a number of individuals.

155
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:39,583
[SPEAKER_18]: And we looked at what other communities were doing in terms of this.

156
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:44,426
[SPEAKER_18]: So the fee structure is in line with what other cities and towns are doing.

157
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:49,649
[SPEAKER_18]: You will see that there is no fee that's related to restaurants and other small businesses.

158
00:12:52,202 --> 00:13:05,724
[SPEAKER_18]: that was included, but in light of some of the challenging times that are being faced by restaurants and small businesses, given the economic times, that fee was removed as part of this proposal and can certainly be added in later as part of it.

159
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:14,406
[SPEAKER_18]: They will certainly have to also submit an IPM, which is with the plan, that's part of it, but there's no fee associated with those measures.

160
00:13:14,806 --> 00:13:20,987
[SPEAKER_18]: So what other cities and towns are doing, try to bring it in line with that and try to be as fair as possible.

161
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:22,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

162
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:22,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

163
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,442
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just kind of on that general scope, um, you know, how much might this raise in a year?

164
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:34,284
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the general cost of some of the road and abatement measures that you want to implement and that we all want to see implemented?

165
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:38,406
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, would these fees provide enough revenue to accomplish the goal?

166
00:13:38,946 --> 00:13:39,246
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

167
00:13:39,346 --> 00:13:39,646
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

168
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:44,848
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't have the exact figure as to what, if we've modeled this out yet, but I can certainly get that information for you.

169
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:59,444
[SPEAKER_18]: And I can touch base with Marian O'Connor, who is on a very well-deserved vacation at the moment, to get the exact amount of which we've spent on road mitigation and baiting and trapping in the last couple of months, especially as we've seen an increase.

170
00:13:59,644 --> 00:14:01,044
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can get that information for you, no problem.

171
00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:02,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Dave.

172
00:14:02,165 --> 00:14:02,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Super helpful.

173
00:14:03,582 --> 00:14:06,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Councilor Peters, Councilor Nathan, Councilor Caviello.

174
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

175
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:13,335
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to recommend maybe a committee of the whole on this paper so that we can go over it in further detail.

176
00:14:14,276 --> 00:14:18,522
[SPEAKER_15]: There are certainly some great aspects to it and some questions and concerns that I have relative to

177
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:28,708
[SPEAKER_15]: whether it applies to dumpster permits as well, whether or not we could extend this maybe to cover some compost files or some requirements around composting as well, Mr. President.

178
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:33,231
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, I'd offer the motion that we convene in the committee of the whole to go over this ordinance.

179
00:14:33,812 --> 00:14:34,352
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll second that.

180
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:37,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to do that as a B paper, Councilor Layton?

181
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:44,138
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be the motions to just have a committee of the whole.

182
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:45,780
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know if it has to be a B paper.

183
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not amending it in any way.

184
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,240
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

185
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:54,831
[SPEAKER_10]: seconded by councilor Scott Kelly to have a committee to hold regarding this.

186
00:14:55,831 --> 00:15:00,695
[SPEAKER_10]: This issue, or more specifically to have a committee to hold regarding 20-519.

187
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:03,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk, please call the roll.

188
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:04,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

189
00:15:05,397 --> 00:15:05,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Council Marks.

190
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

191
00:15:09,461 --> 00:15:11,863
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to thank my other colleagues for putting this on tonight.

192
00:15:12,964 --> 00:15:16,507
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, this has been, I probably put this on the agenda for the last four years.

193
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:19,069
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's been a major issue in our community.

194
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Originally, it started out in South Method on the Somerville Method line.

195
00:15:24,113 --> 00:15:28,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Then the Heights received a large amount of infestation.

196
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:33,621
[SPEAKER_11]: The Wellington area, which I live in, was recently baited and trapped.

197
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:35,222
[SPEAKER_11]: put down.

198
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:41,067
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think as part of an ordinance, you know, I like this ordinance.

199
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,088
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it needs to be properly vetted.

200
00:15:43,128 --> 00:15:44,249
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with Councilor Knight.

201
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:47,971
[SPEAKER_11]: However, we do have to look at enforcement, Mr. President.

202
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:54,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Many residents in this community are complaining about people leaving trash outside

203
00:15:54,876 --> 00:16:03,384
[SPEAKER_11]: food in the backyard, leaving open invitation for these vermins to come in and feed and feast.

204
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:05,105
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why they're hanging around.

205
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:11,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Another issue, Mr. President, is, in my opinion, the lack of baiting and trapping in the community.

206
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:14,473
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not as aggressive as I believe we should be.

207
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:21,438
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's, I think, a discussion we need to have with the city administration when we start vetting out the ordinance itself.

208
00:16:22,058 --> 00:16:26,982
[SPEAKER_11]: The last point, Mr. President, I have is regarding private property.

209
00:16:27,642 --> 00:16:53,197
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard all too many times when the city goes out and they start doing their baiting and trapping that they've witnessed Borrowing and nest on private property and I can understand the city can't be the gatekeeper for everyone's property however, if there's a nuisance of a property that's in a particular neighborhood and the city's aware they can see that there's nest and infiltration and

210
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:54,177
[SPEAKER_11]: and so forth.

211
00:16:54,838 --> 00:17:04,941
[SPEAKER_11]: I think more needs to be done, Mr. President, to work with homeowners and maybe work with absentee landlords that may not give a damn, that don't live in the area, to be quite honest.

212
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:09,262
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we have to do more as a community to safeguard the neighborhoods.

213
00:17:09,722 --> 00:17:19,746
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we do locate these nests that are borrowed into private property, I think the concern should be with the residents as well as the city, Mr. President.

214
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,987
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that'll go a long way to curbing

215
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:28,650
[SPEAKER_11]: the rat problem that we've had in the community for many, many years.

216
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,251
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not a recent issue.

217
00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:34,153
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not because of just recent construction.

218
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,854
[SPEAKER_11]: This has been ongoing for many, many years in the community.

219
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:48,941
[SPEAKER_11]: And I look forward to having a dialogue, Mr. President, where we can address this by city ordinance and also by enforcement and outreach, which needs to happen as well in the community.

220
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:49,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

221
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:51,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

222
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other councils like to speak on this issue?

223
00:17:54,062 --> 00:17:55,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight and then Vice President Caviello.

224
00:17:55,803 --> 00:17:56,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

225
00:17:56,904 --> 00:17:58,346
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

226
00:17:58,366 --> 00:18:03,070
[SPEAKER_15]: And building on what Councilor Marks had to say, I think it makes great sense.

227
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,152
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, government's constructed to help people.

228
00:18:05,232 --> 00:18:07,114
[SPEAKER_15]: Government's constructed to deliver services.

229
00:18:07,614 --> 00:18:10,196
[SPEAKER_15]: It shouldn't be an us versus them situation.

230
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:15,761
[SPEAKER_15]: When someone calls and says they have an infestation problem in the neighborhood, that's a serious issue and a serious problem.

231
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,363
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it's gross, quite frankly.

232
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:20,288
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, government should be reaching out and doing all they can to help.

233
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:27,895
[SPEAKER_15]: And the property line should not be the determining factor as to whether or not individuals are going to be receiving government services, especially here at the local level.

234
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:40,148
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I think that moving forward, enforcement is going to be an issue, but also our Board of Health reaching out and helping residents when they run into this situation, circumstance and helping them bait and coming up with a road and abatement plan for them.

235
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:49,779
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe having some of these funds from the revolving account used to go back into the community to help people who are facing infestations, being able to fund some extermination services.

236
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,783
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'm looking forward to meeting on this.

237
00:18:54,385 --> 00:18:54,625
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

238
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:55,126
[SPEAKER_28]: God tonight.

239
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:56,467
[SPEAKER_28]: Vice President Caviello.

240
00:18:57,989 --> 00:18:58,730
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

241
00:18:58,810 --> 00:18:59,010
[SPEAKER_28]: Again,

242
00:19:00,142 --> 00:19:09,074
[SPEAKER_28]: Council marks mentioned many of the things that I was never but I agree with them that we have to step up with the people that are beating these companies are supposed to be doing it.

243
00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:10,836
[SPEAKER_28]: They need to increase what they're doing.

244
00:19:11,196 --> 00:19:15,823
[SPEAKER_28]: Also, like he said, you know, we've got many abandoned properties in the city of Medford.

245
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:18,286
[SPEAKER_28]: with absentee landlords.

246
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:20,468
[SPEAKER_28]: And it isn't just the abandoned properties.

247
00:19:20,788 --> 00:19:32,202
[SPEAKER_28]: Also, there's many, many, many abandoned vehicles in people's driveways and on side streets that have been sitting there for years that have now become rodent traps.

248
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:44,294
[SPEAKER_28]: So again, I think we do need to sit down with our committee and more sooner than later, because as I said, there is construction going on pretty much everywhere in the city that you go.

249
00:19:44,614 --> 00:19:48,055
[SPEAKER_28]: So Mr. President, if you could call a committee at the whole meeting.

250
00:19:48,175 --> 00:19:57,177
[SPEAKER_28]: I know we've got many on the agenda, but if you can kind of move this one to the head a little quicker, it'd be greatly appreciated.

251
00:19:57,197 --> 00:20:02,238
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think the residents would be appreciated, especially with all the construction that's going on around the city right now.

252
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:03,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

253
00:20:04,476 --> 00:20:08,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

254
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President?

255
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:11,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor?

256
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:21,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Just if I could, as we all know, we also have many state roads and state parcels of land in the community, which the city is not responsible for.

257
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:28,135
[SPEAKER_11]: And I need to say that I did reach out immediately to Representative Donato because it was the Wellington area.

258
00:20:30,254 --> 00:20:37,060
[SPEAKER_11]: And he was quick to respond, Mr. President, regarding concerns and quick to address it on the state level as well.

259
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,802
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to thank Representative Donato for his work.

260
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:43,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

261
00:20:46,168 --> 00:20:50,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, seeing and hearing none, any questions or comments from the public?

262
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:02,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, do you see anybody's hands up?

263
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:04,069
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see anyone, but I just wanna make sure I didn't miss anyone.

264
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, let me unmute you.

265
00:21:06,491 --> 00:21:14,197
[SPEAKER_21]: You're still muted.

266
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:16,599
[SPEAKER_15]: Sandy hasn't seen anyone.

267
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:17,399
[SPEAKER_15]: I can read his lips.

268
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:18,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay, good.

269
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job, Councilor.

270
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:20,602
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

271
00:21:22,343 --> 00:21:27,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so with that being said, the first vote will be to merge all these papers together under 20-519.

272
00:21:29,352 --> 00:21:34,015
[SPEAKER_10]: So on that motion to merge these papers together, Clerk Curnaby, please call the roll.

273
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:37,677
[SPEAKER_19]: And I believe Councilor Knight made the original motion to merge.

274
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:45,222
[SPEAKER_19]: And I believe it was, I don't actually see a second on the original motion.

275
00:21:45,522 --> 00:21:47,763
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it was Councilor Scott Kelly.

276
00:21:48,564 --> 00:21:48,864

329
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:07,789

00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:08,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

331
00:23:08,509 --> 00:23:10,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven affirmative, zero in the negative.

332
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:12,353
[SPEAKER_10]: We will now revert to the regular order of business.

333
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:17,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Motions, orders, and resolutions of 20-503 offered by Councilor Knight.

334
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:24,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council requests the city administration implement beautification standards for establishments

335
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,882
[SPEAKER_10]: granted preliminary outdoor dining licenses under the governor's emergency order.

336
00:23:29,402 --> 00:23:29,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Counselor Knight.

337
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,083
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

338
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:44,168
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a resolution that is not intended to present another undue burden on our already struggling businesses that are facing the coronavirus epidemic.

339
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:54,292
[SPEAKER_15]: However, I do think we can do a better job in presenting some curb appeal when we're doing some of these outdoor dining license and outdoor dining establishments, Mr. President.

340
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,978
[SPEAKER_15]: For example, we've seen what they've done down at Bistro 5.

341
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:02,501
[SPEAKER_15]: They put some lattice work up, they put a tent up, they put some lights up, and it looks nice.

342
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:08,745
[SPEAKER_15]: But then you go to other places in the community and you see the concrete Jersey barrier taken up five parking spots, and that's all it is.

343
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:22,815
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm hoping that maybe we can implement some minimum beautification standards on the outdoor dining license, Mr. President, so that when we do have areas that need to be protected with Jersey barriers and the like, we also have some requirements and standards to

344
00:24:23,657 --> 00:24:25,402
[SPEAKER_15]: maintain, keep, and improve our curb appeal.

345
00:24:25,522 --> 00:24:28,791
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's the intention behind this resolution and I ask my council colleagues to support it.

346
00:24:29,354 --> 00:24:30,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

347
00:24:30,495 --> 00:24:32,556
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Morrell.

348
00:24:32,616 --> 00:24:33,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

349
00:24:33,957 --> 00:24:37,279
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, President Falco, and thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up.

350
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,002
[SPEAKER_22]: I do have a concern to follow up with this.

351
00:24:42,842 --> 00:24:54,150
[SPEAKER_22]: I got a few emails this week, a little too late to put it on the agenda, but it might help if we could, Councilor Knight would allow me to amend it to ask the,

352
00:24:56,471 --> 00:24:58,793
[SPEAKER_22]: the code enforcement officer, if they can go out.

353
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:12,882
[SPEAKER_22]: I know that some of the Jersey barriers, I believe, in West Medford, I was told that it doesn't suffice for our residents in wheelchairs.

354
00:25:12,962 --> 00:25:20,588
[SPEAKER_22]: So I believe we have a few people in West Medford that traverse that area, and unfortunately,

355
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:24,532
[SPEAKER_22]: couldn't make their way in front of a restaurant.

356
00:25:25,813 --> 00:25:33,000
[SPEAKER_22]: So if we can ask our city administrations, please, just to go out there and measure just to make sure that we're in compliance.

357
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:37,184
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that beautification is important, but we still have to have safe

358
00:25:37,845 --> 00:25:45,027
[SPEAKER_22]: pathways for our residents, especially our residents that need assistance to maneuver through that area.

359
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:48,468
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you can, I make that as a motion if we can.

360
00:25:48,508 --> 00:25:48,848
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

361
00:25:48,868 --> 00:25:50,108
[SPEAKER_22]: I have no opposition.

362
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,209
[SPEAKER_22]: I have no opposition to the amendment, Mr. President.

363
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:53,209
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks, Councilor.

364
00:25:53,229 --> 00:25:55,849
[SPEAKER_10]: The resolution has been amended by Councilor Scarpelli.

365
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,030
[SPEAKER_07]: We have now Councilor Morrell.

366
00:25:59,318 --> 00:25:59,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

367
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:02,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I did have some residents reach out about this as well.

368
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:04,179
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

369
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:05,880
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did speak with Ms.

370
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:14,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Briseño in the Office of Community Development, and she did say the grant money that is being used for some of these Jersey barriers would allow for it to be used for decorations too.

371
00:26:14,422 --> 00:26:18,063
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's just helpful information for those businesses should this pass.

372
00:26:18,103 --> 00:26:18,723
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

373
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:20,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

374
00:26:20,884 --> 00:26:22,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Any questions or comments from the council?

375
00:26:24,705 --> 00:26:28,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, seeing and hearing none, any questions from the public or any comments?

376
00:26:30,495 --> 00:26:35,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, let's see, we have Chief of Staff Rodriguez, and then we have Susan Bibbins.

377
00:26:36,286 --> 00:26:38,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, Dave Rodriguez.

378
00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:40,293
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

379
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,774
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you to the rest of the council as well.

380
00:26:42,474 --> 00:26:44,755
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a point certainly well taken for us.

381
00:26:45,315 --> 00:26:53,679
[SPEAKER_18]: We had a lengthy conversation with some staff this week regarding the beautification of some of these, especially the ones in which Jersey barriers were placed.

382
00:26:54,099 --> 00:27:01,141
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know that we've engaged with conversations with the Chamber of Commerce to paint these things, make it more appealing, make it more aesthetically pleasing.

383
00:27:01,682 --> 00:27:04,863
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's certainly something that's on our radar screen for the upcoming future.

384
00:27:05,702 --> 00:27:13,066
[SPEAKER_18]: And if there are any concerns about ADA compliance or measurements or anything, please forward those to me or to the code enforcement officer.

385
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,367
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll have you to look over those as soon as possible.

386
00:27:15,787 --> 00:27:17,588
[SPEAKER_18]: That's certainly a concern of ours.

387
00:27:17,648 --> 00:27:25,911
[SPEAKER_18]: When we did these measurings, we had a pretty deliberate and thoughtful ways to how we were doing it to make sure that that was in play when we were discussing this.

388
00:27:25,931 --> 00:27:32,094
[SPEAKER_18]: So, but things have moved around or if there's some compliance that we have to engage with, we're happy to do that as well.

389
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:34,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

390
00:27:34,857 --> 00:27:37,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, we have Councilor Knight.

391
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:45,945
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to commend the administration, Mr. President, on getting the emergency outdoor dining licenses up and running in relatively fast order.

392
00:27:46,646 --> 00:27:54,031
[SPEAKER_15]: When the governor issued his executive order allowing outdoor dining licenses to be issued under the emergency order, the administration embraced it and ran with it.

393
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:59,055
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, it's not to be critical of the job that they've done at all because they've done a great job.

394
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:01,597
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just a suggestion as to how we can improve.

395
00:28:01,657 --> 00:28:02,938
[SPEAKER_15]: So I appreciate the work that they've done.

396
00:28:03,945 --> 00:28:05,306
[SPEAKER_18]: That's certainly a point well taken.

397
00:28:07,127 --> 00:28:10,789
[SPEAKER_18]: We wanted to get them up and running so that they could survive and thrive first.

398
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:15,651
[SPEAKER_18]: And now we're happy to make them integrated to the community, integrated to some of the squares as well.

399
00:28:15,711 --> 00:28:22,115
[SPEAKER_18]: So the regs weren't necessarily designed for a place like Medford, but we were certainly able to embrace it pretty quickly.

400
00:28:22,755 --> 00:28:28,358
[SPEAKER_18]: The mayor made it a priority, and OCD did a great job pushing it through.

401
00:28:28,778 --> 00:28:30,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

402
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:31,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

403
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Susan Bibbins, name and address for the record, please.

404
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:39,691
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Susan Bivens, and I live in South Medford.

405
00:28:40,111 --> 00:28:48,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Ward 2, Precinct 8, or the other way around.

406
00:28:49,413 --> 00:29:03,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the chair of the Commission for Persons with Disabilities, and I'd just like to remind you and

407
00:29:04,254 --> 00:29:17,019
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to caution you and charge everybody with making sure that the outdoor door dining establishment has

408
00:29:32,368 --> 00:29:45,712
[SPEAKER_02]: clearance with your jersey barriers or whatever they put up and remember the corners and remember those curb cuts and that kind of thing.

409
00:29:45,832 --> 00:29:56,575
[SPEAKER_02]: So people with mobility challenges or using wheelchairs for mobility can have access to where they need to go.

410
00:29:56,595 --> 00:30:01,437
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just my two cents.

411
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

412
00:30:05,057 --> 00:30:09,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, we have Vice President Caviello had a comment.

413
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

414
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:18,827
[SPEAKER_28]: To the Chief of Staff, Dave, how long are these outdoor dining establishments gonna be out there till?

415
00:30:19,127 --> 00:30:19,768
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you have a date?

416
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,330
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, the regs are active until November 1st.

417
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:23,511
[SPEAKER_18]: November 1st?

418
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:25,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's the window in which we have to work with.

419
00:30:26,053 --> 00:30:26,313
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

420
00:30:27,388 --> 00:30:49,795
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, just to reaffirm what Councilor Knight said, we appreciate all the effort to keep the businesses afloat and keep them going, but is there a way that maybe we can use some of that money to commission some of our high school students, our talented artists that have gone out and painted

421
00:30:50,455 --> 00:30:52,338
[SPEAKER_22]: these utility boxes.

422
00:30:52,678 --> 00:30:57,025
[SPEAKER_22]: That might be an avenue that we could really help with those Jersey areas.

423
00:30:57,045 --> 00:30:57,806
[SPEAKER_22]: They're so talented.

424
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,109
[SPEAKER_22]: You see it all over this community in different ways.

425
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:05,076
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe that might be an avenue that we can really invite our

426
00:31:05,837 --> 00:31:32,240
[SPEAKER_22]: our community and we have so many of these blocks that might be something that if there's a way that the city can make that work or if that that we could you know bring some kids in for community service or or uh anything that uh would help that but just a suggestion thank you thank you council Scott Pelley uh let's see any other questions from the council comments from the council okay seeing and hearing now we have a comment uh question from

427
00:31:35,198 --> 00:31:35,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it Marcia?

428
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:37,540
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, it's Marcia.

429
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,240
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, hi.

430
00:31:38,821 --> 00:31:42,003
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm Marcia Cheerson, 11 Upton Terrace, Medford.

431
00:31:43,104 --> 00:32:02,799
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to thank you so much for thinking about accessibility in this project, because as those of you who must remember me from last year, I think it's really important if Medford can be a city that leads the way in

432
00:32:05,608 --> 00:32:25,977
[SPEAKER_24]: in keeping that in mind for everything, all construction and all new regulations and to make the idea of accessibility as broad as possible because I'm sure you know by now that the ADA does not cover all accessibility needs by any means.

433
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:32,534
[SPEAKER_24]: And I believe that Medford has the ability to be more forward thinking.

434
00:32:32,614 --> 00:32:37,197
[SPEAKER_24]: And I thank you so much for hearing me about this so much.

435
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:38,678
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

436
00:32:38,698 --> 00:32:44,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other comments or questions from the public?

437
00:32:47,143 --> 00:32:49,045
[SPEAKER_19]: I think Rick Jordan may wanna speak, Mr. President.

438
00:32:49,505 --> 00:32:50,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, let me find him.

439
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:56,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, if you find him,

440
00:32:57,365 --> 00:32:57,985
[SPEAKER_21]: Please unmute him.

441
00:32:58,065 --> 00:33:07,927
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm looking.

442
00:33:08,227 --> 00:33:14,989
[SPEAKER_19]: He just told me he can't find the raise hand function, so I'm thinking he might want to talk, but I can't find him.

443
00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:22,691
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go to participants, if you click participants, you can then search a list, and you can just type in and unmute people as you find their name.

444
00:33:23,411 --> 00:33:24,351
[SPEAKER_15]: Rick looks like he's on the beach.

445
00:33:25,273 --> 00:33:27,593
[SPEAKER_15]: He's got the picture of the beach with the rocks in the ocean.

446
00:33:27,913 --> 00:33:28,254
[SPEAKER_15]: I got him.

447
00:33:35,155 --> 00:33:36,215
[SPEAKER_19]: He's muted, Mr. President.

448
00:33:36,455 --> 00:33:37,515
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm having trouble unmuting him.

449
00:33:37,535 --> 00:33:40,216
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let me see.

450
00:33:42,076 --> 00:33:49,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not have a question at this time, but I cannot raise my hand for a future discussion and was not able to in the past few meetings.

451
00:33:51,538 --> 00:33:52,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a Windows computer.

452
00:33:56,012 --> 00:33:57,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Rick, do you have a question now, Rick?

453
00:33:57,613 --> 00:33:58,714
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, I missed that first part.

454
00:33:59,294 --> 00:34:00,615
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not currently, thank you.

455
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:01,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

456
00:34:02,016 --> 00:34:07,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I believe Councilor Pierce.

457
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:10,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

458
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:13,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really up to Councilor Knight.

459
00:34:13,463 --> 00:34:20,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering if we could amend this to also make sure that as Susan and as folks have said that we

460
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:25,891
[SPEAKER_05]: make sure that this is looking at access for people with disabilities.

461
00:34:27,311 --> 00:34:33,172
[SPEAKER_05]: If we're going down there for beautification, we might as well make sure there's the necessary clearance for people who need access.

462
00:34:35,012 --> 00:34:39,313
[SPEAKER_15]: With all due respect to the commentary around ADA compliance, that's the standard.

463
00:34:40,194 --> 00:34:43,274
[SPEAKER_15]: That should be happening regardless of what's going on in our community.

464
00:34:44,394 --> 00:34:52,296
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that it might be important for us if we do have some locations or sites in the city that we ask our ADA compliance officer, the director of diversity to go down there and check it out.

465
00:34:53,107 --> 00:34:56,750
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it certainly won't take anything away from the resolution, so I have no problem with you putting it in there.

466
00:34:57,351 --> 00:35:04,617
[SPEAKER_15]: But the sole principle and purpose was for us to, you know, create some standards and beautification standards.

467
00:35:04,877 --> 00:35:06,378
[SPEAKER_15]: ADA compliance is always an issue.

468
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,759
[SPEAKER_15]: It's always something that we need to do.

469
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,400
[SPEAKER_15]: It's always something that we should be focused on.

470
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,343
[SPEAKER_15]: So I have no problem amending the paper to reflect that.

471
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:15,025
[SPEAKER_15]: However, I don't want it to detract from the principal goal and objective.

472
00:35:15,952 --> 00:35:17,413
[SPEAKER_05]: No, and I appreciate the principle.

473
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:19,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's really important that we do it.

474
00:35:20,414 --> 00:35:24,817
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just, if we're going down there to look at the beautification, it's another opportunity to check those distances.

475
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:26,637
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate that, Councilor Knight.

476
00:35:28,819 --> 00:35:30,900
[SPEAKER_10]: So you are amending Council of Heirs?

477
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,520
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

478
00:35:33,061 --> 00:35:35,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

479
00:35:35,222 --> 00:35:35,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

480
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:37,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions from the Council?

481
00:35:39,484 --> 00:35:39,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

482
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:43,186
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by

483
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Second, Mr. President.

484
00:35:46,274 --> 00:35:51,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caravello as amended by Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Behrs.

485
00:35:51,737 --> 00:35:52,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk Cunabese, please call the roll.

486
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:56,701
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Behrs.

487
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:57,641
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

488
00:35:58,482 --> 00:35:59,403
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Caravello.

489
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:00,503
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

490
00:36:01,044 --> 00:36:01,484
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight.

491
00:36:01,924 --> 00:36:02,144
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

492
00:36:02,585 --> 00:36:03,165
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks.

493
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:03,926
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

494
00:36:04,306 --> 00:36:04,906
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Morrell.

495
00:36:05,387 --> 00:36:05,607
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

496
00:36:05,987 --> 00:36:06,748
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpelli.

497
00:36:07,188 --> 00:36:07,408
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

498
00:36:07,428 --> 00:36:08,449
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Falco.

499
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, so the affirmative and the negative, the motion passes.

500
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:25,039
[SPEAKER_10]: 2-0-505 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request the city solicitor provide a draft zoning amendment authorizing the construction of accessory dwelling units for council deliberation.

501
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:27,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

502
00:36:27,341 --> 00:36:28,561
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

503
00:36:29,202 --> 00:36:37,148
[SPEAKER_15]: Accessory use dwelling is a self-contained apartment in a single family homeless owner occupied attached

504
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,892
[SPEAKER_15]: or in a separate structure on the same lot of land.

505
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:49,339
[SPEAKER_15]: Many times these are referred to as in-law apartments or granny flats is another term that I've seen raised.

506
00:36:49,699 --> 00:36:58,065
[SPEAKER_15]: But what accessory dwelling units will allow us to do is to create more affordable housing stock in our community and more housing stock in our community.

507
00:36:58,806 --> 00:37:04,630
[SPEAKER_15]: We hear a lot about people that are being overhoused, people that are single living in a two, three or four bedroom home.

508
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:11,324
[SPEAKER_15]: But because there's a lack of stock and a lack of affordable stock, especially, there are many downsides.

509
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:27,874
[SPEAKER_15]: So Mr. President, looking at what's going on in our community, the cry for more affordable housing and more housing stock in the greater Boston area, and the fact that studies would show that by allowing accessory dwelling units, assessments go up anywhere between

510
00:37:30,178 --> 00:37:34,442
[SPEAKER_15]: 25 to 34% in communities that allow accessory dwelling units in terms of property taxes.

511
00:37:34,522 --> 00:37:39,366
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's something that's very worthy of review, examination and debate.

512
00:37:41,147 --> 00:37:51,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Previously, the city of Medford did allow accessory dwelling units and they allowed them well before any of our time, well before Mr. Moki's time through what was called the restrictive covenant.

513
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:57,200
[SPEAKER_15]: And that restrictive covenant was filed at the registry of deeds saying that when this parcel changed hands,

514
00:37:57,636 --> 00:38:01,818
[SPEAKER_15]: that the accessory dwelling unit, which would have a kitchen and a bathroom in it, the kitchen would be removed.

515
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:03,919
[SPEAKER_15]: It would not be sold as a multifamily dwelling.

516
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,101
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's something we can also take a look at, Mr. President.

517
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:12,384
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, the restrictive covenant became something that became difficult to enforce, and that's why it fell by the wayside.

518
00:38:12,404 --> 00:38:15,966
[SPEAKER_15]: So that may not be the best way to move about it, but it is an option for us.

519
00:38:16,286 --> 00:38:26,652
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, I think that it would make sense for the building commissioner and the city solicitor to provide us with a draft for us to debate, deliberate, and hopefully discuss with Mr. Bob Roski.

520
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:33,061
[SPEAKER_15]: I've had the opportunity of speaking with Andrew a little about this from our community development board at great lengths.

521
00:38:33,801 --> 00:38:38,642
[SPEAKER_15]: Andrew is an expert in smart growth and accessory dwelling, accessory use dwellings.

522
00:38:39,422 --> 00:38:43,784
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, he provides us with a vast array of expertise and knowledge in this area.

523
00:38:43,844 --> 00:38:48,605
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that this is something that the community development board would be excited to work with us on.

524
00:38:49,165 --> 00:38:51,926
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support the measure.

525
00:38:52,426 --> 00:38:54,927
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, when we talk about accessories dwellings,

526
00:38:56,402 --> 00:39:04,368
[SPEAKER_15]: an apartment above a garage, Mr. President, or a small home in a backyard, you know, with the setbacks and zoning allows for it.

527
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:07,811
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that that's, you know, a backyard cottage, something like that, a basement apartment.

528
00:39:08,391 --> 00:39:23,062
[SPEAKER_15]: But just the housing options for people, you know, you know, someone who has aging parents, you know, I think that an accessory dwelling unit will be great for someone in my situation where I have a wife, young kids and an aging father who has his independence, but I would like to have him closer to me.

529
00:39:23,482 --> 00:39:44,006
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, so those are just some things that we need to talk about and discuss, especially when we look at the city of Medford, the desire for us all to age in place and the opportunities and options that are out there and the limits that are surrounding them at this point in time, I think make this a good measure to pursue and to take a look at Mr. President.

530
00:39:44,026 --> 00:39:47,447
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, I rest my case and I'll ask my council colleagues to support the endeavor.

531
00:39:48,467 --> 00:39:49,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

532
00:39:50,308 --> 00:39:51,868
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by?

533
00:39:53,894 --> 00:39:54,194
[SPEAKER_05]: second.

534
00:39:54,214 --> 00:39:55,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Behrs.

535
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:56,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Behrs.

536
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:58,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

537
00:39:58,375 --> 00:39:59,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

538
00:39:59,596 --> 00:40:00,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm right there with you.

539
00:40:00,396 --> 00:40:05,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was an incredible explanation and I think this is something we should do for our community.

540
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:08,699
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm supportive of this and supportive of deliberating on it.

541
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:22,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering if we could add a B paper just to get an update from the solicitor's office on the status of some ordinance we've requested and also whether or not KP Law is helping out with ordinance drafting.

542
00:40:27,348 --> 00:40:27,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

543
00:40:27,568 --> 00:40:31,432
[SPEAKER_10]: So the, uh, so the B paper, uh, clerk, do you have the language for the B paper?

544
00:40:31,452 --> 00:40:49,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President in light of, um, in light of the events that have transpired over the past, uh, since January now, eight months, nine months,

545
00:40:50,769 --> 00:40:54,912
[SPEAKER_15]: the number of ordinances that we've requested to be drafted and the number of ordinances that have come back.

546
00:40:54,972 --> 00:41:03,659
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it might be worthwhile for us to schedule a committee of the whole with representatives from the solicitor's office and the city solicitor to get an update.

547
00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:10,905
[SPEAKER_15]: I filed the resolution maybe 90 days ago seeking for monthly updates as to where we are in the status of the requested draft ordinances.

548
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:14,171
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's something that I think that we should pursue, Mr. President.

549
00:41:14,191 --> 00:41:17,231
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't gotten an update on the status of any of our draft ordinances.

550
00:41:17,251 --> 00:41:21,412
[SPEAKER_15]: So it might make sense for us to call a committee of the whole so we can be brought up to speed as to where we are.

551
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:23,132
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the council work product.

552
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:32,874
[SPEAKER_15]: I certainly support Councilor Behr's resolution, but I think that it might make more sense for us instead of to get a report back, but to actually have a meeting and get all get in the same room where we can talk about it.

553
00:41:33,395 --> 00:41:40,576
[SPEAKER_15]: So that would be the only request that I make is that he just changed the language in his amendment to require a committee of the whole as opposed to report back from the administration.

554
00:41:41,848 --> 00:41:42,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I would support that.

555
00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:43,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, counselor.

556
00:41:45,611 --> 00:41:47,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Clark, do you have that language?

557
00:41:48,214 --> 00:42:01,445
[SPEAKER_19]: So the B paper has been changed rather than an update from the solicitor's office on the status of ordinances requested by the council and whether KP law is helping out with the drafting of the ordinance.

558
00:42:01,845 --> 00:42:03,266
[SPEAKER_19]: You want to committee the whole on that?

559
00:42:04,567 --> 00:42:04,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

560
00:42:04,908 --> 00:42:09,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd still like an answer on the KP law, but if it comes before or during that meeting, that's fine.

561
00:42:10,523 --> 00:42:18,547
[SPEAKER_19]: So if I use your original amendment and say as well, as a committee, the whole meeting, does that suffice for everyone?

562
00:42:18,928 --> 00:42:19,328
[SPEAKER_05]: That works.

563
00:42:19,968 --> 00:42:20,569
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine, yep.

564
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,030
[SPEAKER_21]: Does that work for you too?

565
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:28,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Was that the Councilor Knight?

566
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:29,894
[SPEAKER_21]: That was the Councilor.

567
00:42:29,934 --> 00:42:31,094
[SPEAKER_21]: It works for me, absolutely.

568
00:42:31,535 --> 00:42:31,815
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks.

569
00:42:33,156 --> 00:42:33,396
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

570
00:42:33,756 --> 00:42:37,418
[SPEAKER_10]: So the B paper offered by Councilor Beers is seconded by?

571
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:39,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Second, Mr. President.

572
00:42:39,755 --> 00:42:40,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caviello.

573
00:42:41,656 --> 00:42:43,037
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, Vice President Caviello.

574
00:42:43,597 --> 00:42:44,257
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

575
00:42:44,277 --> 00:42:46,198
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

576
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:51,201
[SPEAKER_28]: I think what Councilor Knight when he mentioned, he's talking about people like me.

577
00:42:52,322 --> 00:42:58,565
[SPEAKER_28]: My kids are all moved out of the house and moved away and I got four bedrooms and three bathrooms and me and my wife.

578
00:43:01,463 --> 00:43:16,394
[SPEAKER_28]: That's something, and I know there's many other people like myself, we've got these big houses and we could probably put it in our apartment and it would give us a chance to age in place in the same method where we'd like to stay.

579
00:43:17,174 --> 00:43:23,799
[SPEAKER_28]: Without having to move out and maybe sell the house to maybe one of our family or someone that would.

580
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:41,565
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that we should... I think... I think we're getting... I think that we should... Clerk Herbie, can you mute everyone please?

581
00:43:41,645 --> 00:43:42,606
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm trying.

582
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:50,530
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

583
00:43:52,492 --> 00:43:57,935
[SPEAKER_28]: But again, like I say, I think he's talking about people in my age group who, like I say, you know,

584
00:43:58,793 --> 00:43:59,714
[SPEAKER_28]: Our children are all gone.

585
00:43:59,754 --> 00:44:02,476
[SPEAKER_28]: We've got this big house and nobody in it.

586
00:44:03,297 --> 00:44:06,800
[SPEAKER_28]: And I said, you know, probably could do it in our apartment somewhere on the line.

587
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,704
[SPEAKER_28]: So I hope, I wholeheartedly support this and look forward to an ordinance coming forward.

588
00:44:13,865 --> 00:44:15,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

589
00:44:15,106 --> 00:44:15,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks.

590
00:44:16,526 --> 00:44:17,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

591
00:44:17,747 --> 00:44:20,509
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank, uh, my colleague Councilor Knight for bringing this up.

592
00:44:21,209 --> 00:44:25,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Councilor Caviello, I have two kids I can drop off tomorrow, if that's all right.

593
00:44:25,933 --> 00:44:32,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, Mr. President, um, you know, for many years in this community,

594
00:44:32,723 --> 00:44:40,309
[SPEAKER_11]: We've had accessory dwelling units, however, they're just not permitted or authorized.

595
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:50,958
[SPEAKER_11]: And those, what I refer to, are illegal basement apartments, illegal attic apartments, and a number of other illegal attachments to homes, Mr. President.

596
00:44:51,658 --> 00:44:55,962
[SPEAKER_11]: And this has been an issue of contention for a lot of years in neighborhoods.

597
00:44:56,522 --> 00:45:04,608
[SPEAKER_11]: especially thickly settled neighborhoods, because you'll see an influx of cars, you'll see an influx of residents.

598
00:45:05,409 --> 00:45:12,634
[SPEAKER_11]: However, these particular illegal units currently are not being permitted by the city.

599
00:45:13,094 --> 00:45:20,860
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's number one, there's a safety concern with electrical, plumbing, heating, you name it, there's a safety concern, Mr. President.

600
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,302
[SPEAKER_11]: And also taxes, Mr. President.

601
00:45:23,962 --> 00:45:28,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Many of these illegal apartments that currently exist now don't pay taxes to the community.

602
00:45:28,987 --> 00:45:34,131
[SPEAKER_11]: So this discussion is well warranted in the community, and it's something that I agree with.

603
00:45:34,811 --> 00:45:49,524
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the very least, we should be looking at in-law apartments, because I agree with my colleagues to allow residents that are at a certain age to stay in their units or their houses, I think makes a lot of sense.

604
00:45:50,765 --> 00:46:01,557
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have to be mindful of the flip side, that once we bring this above board, that we will have an influx into our neighborhoods.

605
00:46:02,117 --> 00:46:06,662
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you think parking is a concern right now, it's going to become even more of a concern.

606
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:16,208
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we have to look at resident permit parking, potentially citywide permit parking, like they do in Cambridge and Somerville and other surrounding communities.

607
00:46:16,688 --> 00:46:26,774
[SPEAKER_11]: So this actually is probably a great issue to bring up because it's going to bring everything that's currently happening, happening illegal in the community above board right now.

608
00:46:27,194 --> 00:46:45,545
[SPEAKER_11]: And we could take a good hard look at how we want to approach this issue, but also be mindful that we don't want our neighborhoods to turn into an area where there's going to be a mass exodus because there are so many units in an area that it becomes unlivable for residents as well.

609
00:46:45,925 --> 00:46:53,229
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think there's a happy median here that we have to find, but the issue definitely needs to be broached.

610
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,811
[SPEAKER_11]: And I look forward to having that discussion.

611
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

612
00:46:58,281 --> 00:46:59,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

613
00:47:02,804 --> 00:47:03,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, seeing and hearing none.

614
00:47:03,805 --> 00:47:06,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, anyone from the public we have?

615
00:47:08,308 --> 00:47:08,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

616
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:14,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Kelly Catalo, name and address for the record.

617
00:47:15,373 --> 00:47:18,195
[SPEAKER_27]: Kelly Catalo, 46 Otis Street in Medford.

618
00:47:18,255 --> 00:47:21,157
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Councilor, President Falco.

619
00:47:21,677 --> 00:47:22,538
[SPEAKER_27]: Councilor Knight.

620
00:47:22,895 --> 00:47:24,836
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you very, very much.

621
00:47:24,936 --> 00:47:34,181
[SPEAKER_27]: For many, many years, I've seen viable apartments being gutted out of these homes as the family moved out, and they were great living spaces.

622
00:47:34,221 --> 00:47:35,742
[SPEAKER_27]: They were affordable for people.

623
00:47:36,963 --> 00:47:50,270
[SPEAKER_27]: Councilor Marks, I know that you have a concern about the cars, and this idea actually came from a fellow realtor in a different state, but what they do in her city is that they only give a certain number of parking permits per house.

624
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:59,820
[SPEAKER_27]: So if that person wanted to be able to rent out their accessible unit, if they had an extra parking permit for that person, then that person could park on the street.

625
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,202
[SPEAKER_27]: If not, they wouldn't have a parking space.

626
00:48:02,362 --> 00:48:07,528
[SPEAKER_27]: I just think that housing has gotten to the point where it is so expensive right now.

627
00:48:07,548 --> 00:48:09,070
[SPEAKER_27]: What information, Mr. President?

628
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:11,392
[SPEAKER_27]: What information, Councillor Larkins?

629
00:48:11,492 --> 00:48:17,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Not to cut you off, Kelly, and I appreciate what you said, but remember that not all streets are permit parking.

630
00:48:18,417 --> 00:48:23,621
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's great to say we have permits, but that's not the case on many, many streets in this community.

631
00:48:24,162 --> 00:48:30,447
[SPEAKER_11]: So in order to implement what you're talking about, we'd have to do some type of permit citywide parking.

632
00:48:31,788 --> 00:48:38,657
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm just asking you to consider working with the parking situation just because the housing situation is that dire right now.

633
00:48:39,057 --> 00:48:43,543
[SPEAKER_27]: With COVID, you know, a lot of the younger generation has all moved home.

634
00:48:43,563 --> 00:48:47,368
[SPEAKER_27]: They would love to have an in-law apartment in their mom's house if they still have some independence.

635
00:48:47,848 --> 00:48:51,390
[SPEAKER_27]: So there are so many great ideas and so many places that you can go with this.

636
00:48:52,010 --> 00:49:00,414
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you could also consider what the city of Boston has done, they've taken accessory dwelling unit and they've actually called it an additional dwelling unit.

637
00:49:00,514 --> 00:49:05,856
[SPEAKER_27]: And there is some legislation that's online that you can get right off of the city of Boston website.

638
00:49:05,956 --> 00:49:11,999
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you would consider that, I think that it would help a lot of people be able to afford to stay in our community.

639
00:49:12,459 --> 00:49:12,819
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

640
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:14,060
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

641
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions or comments from the public?

642
00:49:18,886 --> 00:49:20,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry, Councilor Morrell.

643
00:49:20,926 --> 00:49:22,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think you had your hand up.

644
00:49:22,127 --> 00:49:25,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see Marianne has her hand up, her virtual hand up.

645
00:49:26,268 --> 00:49:27,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I see right here.

646
00:49:27,808 --> 00:49:31,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Marianne, I'm trying to unmute you.

647
00:49:32,029 --> 00:49:33,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, thank you for noticing me.

648
00:49:33,529 --> 00:49:34,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?

649
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:35,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, name and address for the record, please.

650
00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:38,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Marianne Broxton, 25 Exchange Ave in Medford.

651
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:40,630
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple of questions.

652
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:48,412
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that Councilman Knight said that the creation of these apartments would help, you know, hopefully increase affordable housing in Medford.

653
00:49:51,130 --> 00:50:03,820
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love if that was true and if that happens, but my fear is that I know that the city of Boston, any new construction, you have to have 10% of the housing units allocated for affordable housing.

654
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:13,166
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're having individual apartments pop up all around the city, what does that guarantee that actually some of them will be allocated for affordable housing?

655
00:50:14,627 --> 00:50:28,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at real estate, I got a thing that popped up on my Twitter the other day, for an apartment near Tufts that was a five bedroom apartment that was $5,000, you know, which would be great for college students each moving in.

656
00:50:29,338 --> 00:50:34,783
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we're saying, look, what's to prevent like somebody in that area to say, okay, well, I have a garage, let me do it over.

657
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:36,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I can charge like 2,000, 3,000.

658
00:50:36,804 --> 00:50:41,728
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't necessarily allocate more affordable housing for people.

659
00:50:42,302 --> 00:50:51,484
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be great for people that want to have like a mother-in-law apartment or something like that, or maybe a little starter home if their adult children are getting married and they want to set them up in that.

660
00:50:52,504 --> 00:50:53,484
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also have a question.

661
00:50:53,524 --> 00:51:05,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that you mentioned something about the idea of some apartments that don't have, aren't required to have refrigerator and stoves in them, in these types of apartments that it could just be like the bedroom and the bathroom or whatever.

662
00:51:06,348 --> 00:51:08,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, no, no, no, no.

663
00:51:08,348 --> 00:51:14,469
[SPEAKER_15]: I said that there was a restricted covenant on prior prior permitting of these was allowed through a restrictive covenant.

664
00:51:14,509 --> 00:51:18,110
[SPEAKER_15]: And when the property changed hands, the kitchen would have to be taken out.

665
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, because that's what I'm also curious about, too.

666
00:51:20,731 --> 00:51:27,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know in Massachusetts, when you rent an apartment, though, it does not have to have a refrigerator, but it is required by law to have a stove in it.

667
00:51:27,812 --> 00:51:34,873
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was wondering how, how does that play into if we're saying, yes, this is this is something that we want to have more affordable housing.

668
00:51:35,331 --> 00:51:38,335
[SPEAKER_01]: but then it actually never ends up producing more affordable housing.

669
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:41,899
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if people can say, well, we don't really have to follow those guidelines.

670
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:48,027
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I mean, the basic economic principle of supply and demand would drive the housing costs down.

671
00:51:49,462 --> 00:52:02,827
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, it may not be an affordable housing unit per se by the definition of, you know, an affordable housing unit under Department of Housing and Community Development guidelines, but what it would do is make housing more affordable because our stock would increase.

672
00:52:03,307 --> 00:52:06,669
[SPEAKER_15]: So if the supply exceeds the demand, the cost goes down.

673
00:52:07,089 --> 00:52:09,030
[SPEAKER_15]: If the demand exceeds the supply, the cost goes up.

674
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:15,312
[SPEAKER_15]: So just the basic economic principle of supply and demand, the more housing units we have on the market, the cheaper that those units are going to be.

675
00:52:16,225 --> 00:52:28,130
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that idea, but I really think it has to do with the amount of income for people also, maybe alongside supply and demand, because when we consider how many homeless families are in Massachusetts.

676
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:40,575
[SPEAKER_15]: The principle of the accessory use dwelling unit is it's usually a single-family owner-occupied home, right, defined by Massachusetts General Law, a single-family owner-occupied home.

677
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:48,150
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's not, you know, this isn't something where it's going to be, you know, I'm just throwing apartments up all over the place so tough kids can live there.

678
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:49,230
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean?

679
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,991
[SPEAKER_15]: This is to meet a need and a demand in the community.

680
00:52:52,011 --> 00:52:55,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you for your clarification.

681
00:52:55,332 --> 00:52:58,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

682
00:52:58,052 --> 00:53:02,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, any other questions or comments?

683
00:53:07,654 --> 00:53:10,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, we got Jennifer Kerwood.

684
00:53:11,075 --> 00:53:12,075
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to try to unmute you.

685
00:53:14,795 --> 00:53:16,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Jennifer Kerwood, 43 Willis Avenue.

686
00:53:18,345 --> 00:53:29,332
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess my question would be, or I guess suggestions, would be making sure we know how we feel about Airbnbs while considering these sorts of ADUs.

687
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:39,739
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that there are several cities where things like that would come into place and then it doesn't actually provide housing, it's really just meant for the person to have an auxiliary income.

688
00:53:40,299 --> 00:53:47,024
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have no objection to that necessarily, but if the actual rationale behind this is

689
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:54,206
[SPEAKER_08]: to provide housing, it would have to be a consideration, what we would do for like VRBOs and Airbnb and things like that.

690
00:53:54,226 --> 00:53:57,009
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

691
00:53:57,489 --> 00:53:57,910
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all.

692
00:53:58,330 --> 00:53:58,751
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

693
00:54:01,153 --> 00:54:04,156
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, we have, is it Will Laverre?

694
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:10,660
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi there.

695
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:15,844
[SPEAKER_12]: William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

696
00:54:16,345 --> 00:54:19,567
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this is a really great thing, accessory dwelling units.

697
00:54:20,127 --> 00:54:31,176
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that we have issues with affordability, not only in terms of the formal notion of affordability, of the technical definition of the department of housing and so forth.

698
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:37,904
[SPEAKER_12]: But we have the issue that a very small number of people get to live in good locations like Medford.

699
00:54:38,385 --> 00:54:40,867
[SPEAKER_12]: Most Americans have to have a very long commute to work.

700
00:54:40,907 --> 00:54:45,892
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't have any access to trains or buses or all the wonderful things we enjoy here in our community.

701
00:54:46,372 --> 00:54:55,161
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it'd be really great if some of those people, maybe they're commuting from New Hampshire or North Andover or something.

702
00:54:55,601 --> 00:55:08,118
[SPEAKER_12]: and they'd have to catch a train that comes only once every three hours, they can start move to Medford, it'll help our traffic prices, we have more people living, paying taxes in Medford, rather than commuting far-flung locations.

703
00:55:08,398 --> 00:55:11,582
[SPEAKER_12]: And when fewer people are pushed out to those far-flung locations,

704
00:55:12,927 --> 00:55:31,300
[SPEAKER_12]: People won't be as desperate to pay so much money live here and that's gonna be a slow process supply and demand It's not it is supply and demand and getting a little bit more complex to that But basically the idea is that if you're having to force people really far away They're gonna give an arm and a leg to avoid that they have lots of options.

705
00:55:31,481 --> 00:55:37,645
[SPEAKER_12]: It's gonna be a little bit better It'll slowly get better Accessory dwell you and it's good first step to help that.

706
00:55:37,685 --> 00:55:38,065
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

707
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:41,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you See we have a

708
00:55:42,735 --> 00:55:45,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Veronica Hernandez, name and address for the record, please.

709
00:55:45,961 --> 00:55:47,503
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to unmute you.

710
00:55:51,946 --> 00:55:52,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, can you hear me?

711
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:53,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

712
00:55:53,467 --> 00:55:54,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

713
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Veronica Hernandez, 55 Jerome street.

714
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:11,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so mine is, so this kind of goes piggybacking off of what Marianne had mentioned about, uh, you know, like if like it actually being affordable as somebody who had to move out of Medford and end up back in their parents' house.

715
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:19,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, even though Boston does do those affordable housing units and if they were to come to Medford, they're not really affordable.

716
00:56:19,979 --> 00:56:25,142
[SPEAKER_09]: for the everyday person, especially us college students who had to come back home.

717
00:56:25,182 --> 00:56:26,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, point of information.

718
00:56:27,524 --> 00:56:28,765
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

719
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:37,170
[SPEAKER_15]: This is in no way, shape, or form was a proposal to have these as inclusionary zoning housing units.

720
00:56:38,171 --> 00:56:39,252
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just to allow for

721
00:56:40,525 --> 00:56:45,966
[SPEAKER_15]: The ability to permit for an accessory unit to create more housing stock in the community.

722
00:56:46,567 --> 00:56:50,568
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I think we're all getting hung up on this affordable affordable affordable.

723
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:58,790
[SPEAKER_15]: This isn't the proposal that's going to be required to be affordable housing, the affordability is going to lie in the supply and demand with the increase in supply.

724
00:57:00,276 --> 00:57:02,860
[SPEAKER_15]: we're gonna be able to drive the cost of housing down.

725
00:57:03,261 --> 00:57:04,944
[SPEAKER_15]: That's where the affordability comes in.

726
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:12,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Making it more affordable would probably be the best way to put it, but not affordable housing, making housing more affordable, as opposed to increasing our affordable housing stock.

727
00:57:13,988 --> 00:57:21,351
[SPEAKER_15]: These accessory dwelling units in the stock that's going to come with them are not going to be attributable to our 10% threshold under the Department of Housing and Community Development.

728
00:57:22,211 --> 00:57:23,512
[SPEAKER_15]: So I want that to be very clear.

729
00:57:24,572 --> 00:57:30,795
[SPEAKER_15]: The affordability aspect comes into it by increasing the number of units in your community.

730
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:38,918
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to hopefully catch up and then at some point meet or exceed our demand so that this cost will continue to drive down.

731
00:57:39,851 --> 00:57:49,178
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't want us to get hung up on this affordable housing, affordable housing, like it's something that's gonna go towards a safe habit threshold, because that's not the intention of this.

732
00:57:49,218 --> 00:57:59,086
[SPEAKER_15]: The intention of this is to allow people the opportunity to pursue an ability to create in-law apartments and owner-occupied dwellings that are single-family.

733
00:57:59,106 --> 00:58:00,067
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's where this is coming from.

734
00:58:00,187 --> 00:58:01,168
[SPEAKER_15]: I want that to be very clear.

735
00:58:01,908 --> 00:58:02,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Haynes.

736
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:06,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Veronica, please continue.

737
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:08,578
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm all set.

738
00:58:08,698 --> 00:58:09,819
[SPEAKER_09]: He said what he said.

739
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:10,259
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fine.

740
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:10,740
[SPEAKER_09]: We're good.

741
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:11,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

742
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:12,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

743
00:58:12,642 --> 00:58:14,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

744
00:58:19,507 --> 00:58:21,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Gina Doe, name and address for the record, please.

745
00:58:25,312 --> 00:58:25,913
[SPEAKER_25]: Can you hear me?

746
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:26,894
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, we can.

747
00:58:27,414 --> 00:58:27,734
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi.

748
00:58:28,095 --> 00:58:28,495
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

749
00:58:28,695 --> 00:58:30,356
[SPEAKER_25]: I apologize for not having video.

750
00:58:30,417 --> 00:58:32,338
[SPEAKER_25]: My signal doesn't do so well with video.

751
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:35,601
[SPEAKER_25]: Thanks for the opportunity to speak on this important issue.

752
00:58:36,726 --> 00:58:43,349
[SPEAKER_25]: I think there's some confusion on what ADU units are and what they're supposed to do.

753
00:58:44,329 --> 00:58:59,536
[SPEAKER_25]: Accessory dwelling units are historically spaces that are created to allow for additional living, typically of related members.

754
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:02,017
[SPEAKER_25]: So in other words, an in-law apartment.

755
00:59:02,767 --> 00:59:06,809
[SPEAKER_25]: above a garage for your college student to have a place to be.

756
00:59:06,829 --> 00:59:13,232
[SPEAKER_25]: They're not meant to be rental or condo stock.

757
00:59:14,552 --> 00:59:26,738
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's important because we talk about housing and affordability and affordable housing interchangeably, but it's really not.

758
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:32,160
[SPEAKER_25]: The supply and demand curve does not inflect in housing

759
00:59:32,762 --> 00:59:38,523
[SPEAKER_25]: because housing isn't a consumable like a widget or a bag of sugar.

760
00:59:39,504 --> 00:59:59,128
[SPEAKER_25]: And we really need to stop conflating housing affordability with affordable housing government quota that is required by 40B for the state of Massachusetts and what housing stock does in the community.

761
00:59:59,668 --> 01:00:00,289
[SPEAKER_25]: So while

762
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:12,258
[SPEAKER_25]: These AHUs have a place in our community to help maintain places for people to be without being displaced.

763
01:00:12,899 --> 01:00:31,333
[SPEAKER_25]: They will in no way, shape or form do anything to increase affordable housing, quote, units that are required as subsidized housing units are, because they're never built with those subsidy funds because they're usually

764
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:40,644
[SPEAKER_25]: put into existing structures, whether it be a basement, an attic, a front room, above a garage, you're not building them separate.

765
01:00:41,044 --> 01:00:42,824
[SPEAKER_25]: That's the first point I'd like to make.

766
01:00:43,185 --> 01:00:49,987
[SPEAKER_25]: And then the second point is this is just another layer of death by paper cuts.

767
01:00:50,627 --> 01:00:59,531
[SPEAKER_25]: We are currently seeing an influx of housing that's high value housing when we take a parcel and it's cut

768
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:24,648
[SPEAKER_25]: and subdivided, and we get two or four luxury units that are high-end units that do nothing to offset and increase our threshold of income so that our affordable housing threshold rises with it, which further puts housing affordability out of reach for many Medford residents because

769
01:01:25,972 --> 01:01:42,183
[SPEAKER_25]: at least 40% of Medford residents do not meet that $75,000 a year threshold that we typically see with affordable housing requirements and in affordable housing lotteries.

770
01:01:42,844 --> 01:01:55,192
[SPEAKER_25]: So therefore, while I think this is a commendable thing to be looking at, I would caution that we need to be very precise about what we're doing and how we're doing it in the language

771
01:01:55,983 --> 01:02:01,826
[SPEAKER_25]: and that we're sticking to accessory dwelling units for the purpose that's intended.

772
01:02:01,906 --> 01:02:17,973
[SPEAKER_25]: Because otherwise what we're doing is we're creating yet another loophole for quote developers and flippers to come in and up zone through this new ordinance that we're looking to create.

773
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:25,497
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would caution people and I would encourage our population to think about housing affordability

774
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:31,423
[SPEAKER_25]: slightly separate from affordable housing, which is the government mandated portions.

775
01:02:31,723 --> 01:02:32,903
[SPEAKER_25]: So I thank you for your time.

776
01:02:32,923 --> 01:02:33,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

777
01:02:33,924 --> 01:02:38,886
[SPEAKER_10]: May I remind everyone, I apologize, I should have said this from the beginning, my fault.

778
01:02:38,986 --> 01:02:41,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Minute and a half, you get a minute and a half when you're called upon.

779
01:02:42,448 --> 01:02:45,169
[SPEAKER_10]: So if I may, so Kelly.

780
01:02:45,189 --> 01:02:46,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate the latitude.

781
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:47,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

782
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:49,571
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President.

783
01:02:50,572 --> 01:02:51,412
[SPEAKER_28]: Vice President Caviello.

784
01:02:52,113 --> 01:02:54,974
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, I think we've gotten a little bit off track on

785
01:02:55,524 --> 01:02:56,704
[SPEAKER_28]: what Councilor Neal brought up.

786
01:02:58,145 --> 01:03:01,746
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, I don't think he was bringing it up as an affordable housing alternative.

787
01:03:02,266 --> 01:03:08,047
[SPEAKER_28]: It was just something that he asked maybe we could look into and maybe have a discussion on.

788
01:03:08,327 --> 01:03:15,089
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think he brought it up with the point of making them affordable units that would add to our affordable staff.

789
01:03:15,149 --> 01:03:16,969
[SPEAKER_28]: So I want to make that point, Mr. President.

790
01:03:17,409 --> 01:03:18,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Cabral.

791
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:22,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Kelly Catala, did you have a comment?

792
01:03:22,971 --> 01:03:23,651
[SPEAKER_10]: I do.

793
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:24,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

794
01:03:25,971 --> 01:03:26,531
[SPEAKER_10]: name and address.

795
01:03:27,772 --> 01:03:30,593
[SPEAKER_27]: Kelly Catalo, 46 Otis Street in Medford.

796
01:03:31,293 --> 01:03:32,774
[SPEAKER_27]: To follow up what Ms.

797
01:03:32,794 --> 01:03:45,538
[SPEAKER_27]: Caraviello just said and what Mr. Knight said, first of all, Massachusetts state law does allow a owner-occupant to rent up to three unrelated people by the second degree of kindred in their property.

798
01:03:45,998 --> 01:03:46,719
[SPEAKER_27]: So there are

799
01:03:47,759 --> 01:03:59,128
[SPEAKER_27]: access for apartments right now in the city of Medford that a little old lady lives upstairs and she can't afford to pay her taxes and maybe a college student or a young adult is renting her apartment.

800
01:03:59,188 --> 01:04:02,170
[SPEAKER_27]: She is still within the guidelines of the state law.

801
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:04,812
[SPEAKER_27]: and she's able to pay her tax bill.

802
01:04:05,272 --> 01:04:08,295
[SPEAKER_27]: That young person who's living in that apartment is only paying $600.

803
01:04:08,335 --> 01:04:12,659
[SPEAKER_27]: That is housing stock that we all need.

804
01:04:12,759 --> 01:04:16,423
[SPEAKER_27]: We need for the people in our community to be able to live here.

805
01:04:16,803 --> 01:04:22,929
[SPEAKER_27]: Most of the people in our community are not the people that are going to qualify or even go after

806
01:04:23,409 --> 01:04:27,072
[SPEAKER_27]: you know, some of this housing subsidy stuff that people are talking about.

807
01:04:27,492 --> 01:04:31,315
[SPEAKER_27]: And I really don't feel that Adam Knight was looking to do that.

808
01:04:31,375 --> 01:04:35,277
[SPEAKER_27]: He's looking to make Medford affordable to the people of Medford.

809
01:04:35,618 --> 01:04:38,560
[SPEAKER_27]: And I really hope that everybody can get on board with that.

810
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,180
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

811
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:39,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

812
01:04:40,081 --> 01:04:43,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clark, could you read the language to the B paper before we take the vote?

813
01:04:45,905 --> 01:04:46,105
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

814
01:04:48,286 --> 01:04:48,867
[SPEAKER_19]: The B paper.

815
01:04:57,318 --> 01:05:00,641
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't, I'm, Mr. President, I don't have all the language for the B paper.

816
01:05:00,661 --> 01:05:01,822
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm still trying to copy it down.

817
01:05:02,983 --> 01:05:10,449
[SPEAKER_10]: The B paper, I believe, was it correct me if I'm wrong, Councilor Beers was a committee the whole to receive an update from the city solicitor.

818
01:05:12,511 --> 01:05:13,092
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

819
01:05:13,212 --> 01:05:13,492
[SPEAKER_19]: I got it.

820
01:05:13,832 --> 01:05:14,013
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

821
01:05:14,533 --> 01:05:21,039
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the one that was, there was an update from the solicitor on the status of ordinances

822
01:05:25,432 --> 01:05:34,874
[SPEAKER_19]: and whether or not KP law is helping to, is helping out with ordinances, as well as a committee of the whole to discuss the same issue.

823
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:36,335
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct.

824
01:05:37,055 --> 01:05:37,255
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

825
01:05:37,995 --> 01:05:43,697
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion, this is the B paper, on the B paper, the motion of council appears seconded by vice president Caraviello.

826
01:05:44,057 --> 01:05:45,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk, please call the roll.

827
01:05:45,997 --> 01:05:46,597
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Behrs.

828
01:05:47,718 --> 01:05:47,958
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

829
01:05:48,378 --> 01:05:49,258
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice president Caraviello.

830
01:05:52,899 --> 01:05:53,639
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice president Caraviello.

831
01:05:56,108 --> 01:05:56,368
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

832
01:05:56,969 --> 01:05:57,349
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

833
01:05:58,410 --> 01:05:58,930

879
01:07:28,896 --> 01:07:42,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, 20506 by Councilor Behrs, whereas the Massachusetts General Court and Governor Baker agreed to maintain fiscal year 2020 funding levels for two major state aid accounts in current EMPs and budgets of fiscal year 21.

880
01:07:42,443 --> 01:07:47,666
[SPEAKER_10]: And whereas these budget extensions level fund Chapter 70 for public schools at $12,143,306,

881
01:07:51,134 --> 01:07:54,239
[SPEAKER_10]: and unrestricted local aid funding, UGGA, at $12,880,443.

882
01:07:58,148 --> 01:08:13,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, therefore be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the city administration provide an update on the impact of the state budget process on the city budget and how the funding increase of $1,089,537 for chapter 70 and $963,457 for unrestricted local aid above the levels projected in the fiscal year 2021 city budget will be distributed to our public schools and city services.

883
01:08:25,563 --> 01:08:33,309
[SPEAKER_10]: 20-518 is a paper from the Mayor to the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council, City Hall, Memphis, Massachusetts 02155.

884
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:41,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Dear Mr. President and City Council Councillors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approves to amend the school budget

885
01:08:41,695 --> 01:08:43,356
[SPEAKER_10]: fiscal 2021 from $61,250,000 to $62,339,537, which is an increase of $1,089,537.

886
01:08:43,516 --> 01:08:45,837
[SPEAKER_10]: The governor has committed to level fund chapter 70 at the fiscal year 20 level.

887
01:08:45,857 --> 01:08:48,978
[SPEAKER_10]: The city has budgeted a 10% decrease to chapter 70 for fiscal year 2021 due to the health pandemic.

888
01:09:09,077 --> 01:09:11,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Director, Finance Director, Alicia Dunley.

889
01:09:11,358 --> 01:09:16,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Benjamin is present to answer any questions, to answer any of the council's questions regarding this matter.

890
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:18,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Sincerely, Brianna Longo, current mayor.

891
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, let's see.

892
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:28,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Do any of the councilors have questions for Alicia Dunley, Councilor Behrs?

893
01:09:29,313 --> 01:09:34,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to say that I'm glad to see the school portion of my motion is on here.

894
01:09:35,077 --> 01:09:38,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Glad that Director Denley Benjamin is here to answer questions.

895
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:44,344
[SPEAKER_05]: And that leaves the only unresolved question as to what's gonna happen with the local aid funding.

896
01:09:44,444 --> 01:09:47,866
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's now my main question with this motion.

897
01:09:47,986 --> 01:09:48,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

898
01:09:49,607 --> 01:09:49,968
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

899
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:54,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Move the paper, Mr. President.

900
01:09:55,363 --> 01:10:15,982
[SPEAKER_15]: approval on the motion of vice president caviello's second of i that's what bears consulate night uh mr president we could just have an explanation from somebody in the administration as to where these funds are going to go when they are re-injected into our school department's budget i'd appreciate that um i know that you know

901
01:10:17,747 --> 01:10:22,608
[SPEAKER_15]: When we were going through the budget process, there were a number of decisions that were not filled.

902
01:10:22,808 --> 01:10:26,689
[SPEAKER_15]: There was the hope that we would be going to be able to recall, I think another 30 or 40 employees.

903
01:10:27,529 --> 01:10:35,670
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think an update would be worthwhile and sufficient at this point in time as to how these funds are going to be expended in the spirit of Council of Business Resolution.

904
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:41,431
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we have some representatives from the administration here, as well as some representatives from the teachers union that are here this evening as well.

905
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:43,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

906
01:10:43,551 --> 01:10:46,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Alicia or Dave Rodriguez, do either of you have

907
01:10:48,007 --> 01:10:49,328
[SPEAKER_10]: you'd be able to answer those questions?

908
01:10:50,669 --> 01:10:51,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, Honorable Councilors.

909
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:54,893
[SPEAKER_03]: So the school budget is a bottom line budget.

910
01:10:55,113 --> 01:10:57,995
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you voted, it's not like the city where it's byline.

911
01:10:58,515 --> 01:11:04,480
[SPEAKER_03]: So the school would actually have to tell you how they're going to use that million dollars that was level funded.

912
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:10,425
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

913
01:11:10,765 --> 01:11:17,010
[SPEAKER_15]: So is it safe to say at this point in time that the school committee is waiting for us to give them their money so that they can figure out how they want to spend it?

914
01:11:17,884 --> 01:11:18,684
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be correct.

915
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:19,945
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds good.

916
01:11:20,245 --> 01:11:21,345
[SPEAKER_15]: More for approval, Mr. President.

917
01:11:21,845 --> 01:11:22,346
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

918
01:11:22,726 --> 01:11:23,726
[SPEAKER_22]: Scott Kelly.

919
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:25,327
[SPEAKER_22]: If we could if we can ask.

920
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:34,190
[SPEAKER_22]: As soon as this happens, if we could amend this paper, and ask the school committee superintendent to please.

921
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:42,980
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll be a little clearer with our administrators, our teachers, our students, and our parents.

922
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:50,389
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that there's so much going on with COVID and, you know, starting a school and what's been happening.

923
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:53,431
[SPEAKER_22]: Parents not sure who the teachers are going to be.

924
01:11:53,451 --> 01:11:57,832
[SPEAKER_22]: You have administrators that don't know who's going into different classrooms.

925
01:11:57,852 --> 01:12:14,878
[SPEAKER_22]: So if we can have an update sent to all the parties as quickly as possible to eliminate at least that fear and that unease in our kids and our parents and our teachers and administrators, I think it'd be very helpful.

926
01:12:14,978 --> 01:12:16,939
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you for bringing this forward.

927
01:12:19,342 --> 01:12:20,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

928
01:12:20,843 --> 01:12:22,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk Harnaby, do you have that amendment?

929
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:22,703
[SPEAKER_10]: I do.

930
01:12:22,723 --> 01:12:24,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want me to read it back?

931
01:12:25,104 --> 01:12:26,104
[SPEAKER_10]: You can, yeah, sure.

932
01:12:27,685 --> 01:12:38,169
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpelli's amendment was to ask the school committee and the superintendent to be clearer with the administrators, teachers, students, and parents, and update all parties as quickly as possible.

933
01:12:39,502 --> 01:12:42,365
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you need a little, do you need to add a little more to that Councilor Scarpelli?

934
01:12:42,705 --> 01:12:48,751
[SPEAKER_22]: Just on teacher reassignments and dealing with the budget.

935
01:12:48,871 --> 01:12:50,472
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's very important.

936
01:12:50,492 --> 01:12:52,294
[SPEAKER_22]: So if we can do that, that's all.

937
01:12:52,374 --> 01:12:52,714
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

938
01:12:53,575 --> 01:12:54,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Councilor Scarpelli.

939
01:12:56,498 --> 01:12:57,459
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Caviello.

940
01:13:01,102 --> 01:13:02,063
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Caviello.

941
01:13:06,423 --> 01:13:07,163
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

942
01:13:07,303 --> 01:13:13,905
[SPEAKER_28]: I can amend that so we can have a breakdown on to how these funds are being spent, going to be allocated amongst the school.

943
01:13:13,985 --> 01:13:16,746
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know if that was already in there.

944
01:13:17,026 --> 01:13:24,967
[SPEAKER_28]: My internet keeps coming in and out, but I would like to make that informant's amendment that we be informed on how these funds are going to be spent.

945
01:13:25,548 --> 01:13:25,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

946
01:13:26,348 --> 01:13:27,508
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Vice President Carvillo.

947
01:13:29,409 --> 01:13:30,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

948
01:13:31,289 --> 01:13:32,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Councilor Behrs.

949
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:35,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Just Alicia or Dave,

950
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:38,348
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the plan for the local aid piece of this?

951
01:13:41,791 --> 01:13:42,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the chair.

952
01:13:43,532 --> 01:13:52,579
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're still evaluating how we're gonna use the unrestricted general government aid on the city side, but it was a priority right away to get the schools the funding that they needed.

953
01:13:53,039 --> 01:13:59,685
[SPEAKER_03]: So in addition to this paper tonight, there's two other papers for reprogramming more funds to the schools for capital items that the council is gonna see.

954
01:14:00,285 --> 01:14:05,369
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're still in the works, we're still evaluating, but we should have something pretty soon.

955
01:14:06,492 --> 01:14:07,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

956
01:14:09,253 --> 01:14:12,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

957
01:14:14,696 --> 01:14:17,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, seeing and hearing none, any questions from the public?

958
01:14:17,497 --> 01:14:22,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

959
01:14:25,621 --> 01:14:35,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, seeing and hearing none, on the motion of, I think it was, quicker to resume the original,

01:15:46,997 --> 01:15:47,237
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

997
01:15:47,617 --> 01:15:50,799
[SPEAKER_19]: It's six zero and I have to call the president.

998
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:53,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

999
01:15:54,102 --> 01:15:54,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Behrs.

1000
01:15:56,243 --> 01:15:59,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Just moving to take the other communications from the mayor out of order.

1001
01:16:00,084 --> 01:16:20,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Communications from the New York 20-516 to the Honorable President, members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts 02155, dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body reprogram surplus proceeds in the amount of $703,489.80 from the Medford High School Science Labs Project

1002
01:16:26,679 --> 01:16:32,041
[SPEAKER_10]: to the Medford High School Improvements Project in accordance with Mass General Law, Chapter 44, Section 20.

1003
01:16:33,242 --> 01:16:39,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Finance Director Alicia Nunley Benjamin is present to answer any questions, any of the council's questions regarding this matter.

1004
01:16:39,305 --> 01:16:41,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Sincerely, Brianna Longo, current mayor.

1005
01:16:43,226 --> 01:16:47,128
[SPEAKER_28]: Motion for explanation from the administration.

1006
01:16:48,829 --> 01:16:51,010
[SPEAKER_21]: Alicia, would you like to comment further on this, please?

1007
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:56,250
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1008
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:57,530
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening, honorable counselors.

1009
01:16:57,590 --> 01:17:11,693
[SPEAKER_03]: So there were, I'll start with this paper with some bond proceeds that were done and some MSBA money where they spent all the MSBA and they still had some bond proceeds left in the project that was never spent.

1010
01:17:12,373 --> 01:17:18,474
[SPEAKER_03]: So this money can be reprogrammed to the high school for a high school improvement projects.

1011
01:17:18,594 --> 01:17:24,855
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as whatever projects they're doing is for the same amount of time that the loan would have been for the science labs.

1012
01:17:28,405 --> 01:17:32,268
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that the high school, some of the things that they were looking at were HVAC.

1013
01:17:32,348 --> 01:17:37,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that they're looking at, I know I've heard the council too, bathrooms.

1014
01:17:37,412 --> 01:17:41,796
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of projects that they have that improvements that need to go at the high school.

1015
01:17:41,916 --> 01:17:45,399
[SPEAKER_03]: And then set up those bond proceeds just sitting there stagnant in the project.

1016
01:17:45,859 --> 01:17:48,822
[SPEAKER_03]: If you program them to a new project, they can use those now.

1017
01:17:52,124 --> 01:17:54,406
[SPEAKER_28]: Vice President Caviello, are you all set or?

1018
01:17:54,526 --> 01:17:55,407
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm a little confused.

1019
01:17:57,237 --> 01:18:00,098
[SPEAKER_28]: Why we're taking the money that was appropriated for the science labs?

1020
01:18:00,738 --> 01:18:09,599
[SPEAKER_28]: And I mean, I know we need improvements, but why is that allowed to take money that was allocated for a science lab to put it somewhere else?

1021
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:11,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the project was completed.

1022
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:17,401
[SPEAKER_03]: The project was completed for the science lab and that surplus funding that was left.

1023
01:18:20,201 --> 01:18:20,501
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

1024
01:18:22,222 --> 01:18:23,622
[SPEAKER_28]: Can I ask why there was surplus funding?

1025
01:18:24,473 --> 01:18:25,253
[SPEAKER_28]: Did we do the job?

1026
01:18:25,313 --> 01:18:27,194
[SPEAKER_28]: Did we did it get completed on the budget?

1027
01:18:27,794 --> 01:18:29,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming it was under budget.

1028
01:18:29,395 --> 01:18:35,657
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know whenever I've seen surplus funds, it's usually because you have to borrow for the total of what your estimated project is.

1029
01:18:36,197 --> 01:18:42,699
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you're actually doing the work, it usually does come under and you may have a little bit of proceeds left in this case, there was 703,000 left.

1030
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:46,341
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a little bit more than a little bit, but yeah.

1031
01:18:50,262 --> 01:18:53,423
[SPEAKER_28]: I guess if it goes along by long as it goes along with the law,

1032
01:18:56,158 --> 01:18:56,979
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, thank you.

1033
01:18:57,539 --> 01:18:58,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

1034
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,502
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Councilor Morrell, then Councilor Knight.

1035
01:19:00,542 --> 01:19:01,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morrell.

1036
01:19:01,643 --> 01:19:02,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1037
01:19:02,564 --> 01:19:08,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Alicia, you said that the project can be a similar project or however you word it, can be done as long as it's the same amount of time.

1038
01:19:08,749 --> 01:19:10,971
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that timeframe?

1039
01:19:10,991 --> 01:19:11,311
[SPEAKER_07]: 30 years.

1040
01:19:11,932 --> 01:19:12,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, great.

1041
01:19:12,953 --> 01:19:13,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1042
01:19:15,995 --> 01:19:16,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1043
01:19:16,936 --> 01:19:17,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1044
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,441
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1045
01:19:23,095 --> 01:19:25,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so we have two papers before us this evening.

1046
01:19:25,516 --> 01:19:27,037
[SPEAKER_15]: The one that we're speaking of right now is for the $703,000.

1047
01:19:27,357 --> 01:19:27,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

1048
01:19:27,718 --> 01:19:28,278
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

1049
01:19:28,338 --> 01:19:38,623
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is what would have been the savings on the science lab projects through our, um, uh, bond or a bond dissipation notes or whatever it was.

1050
01:19:38,683 --> 01:19:40,645
[SPEAKER_15]: However, we were able to save money on that project.

1051
01:19:41,105 --> 01:19:41,385
[SPEAKER_24]: Correct.

1052
01:19:42,033 --> 01:19:55,020
[SPEAKER_15]: And now what we're doing is we're gonna take that $703,000 and because we had appropriated that previously for school department capital improvements, we're going to repurpose these for continued school department capital improvements?

1053
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:55,840
[SPEAKER_24]: Correct.

1054
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:55,940
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1055
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:00,122
[SPEAKER_15]: And then of this $703,000, 112,000 of that is going to be directed towards the HEAC improvements?

1056
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:00,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1057
01:20:00,282 --> 01:20:01,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Or is that above and beyond?

1058
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:12,866
[SPEAKER_03]: That 112, which is the next paper, will be for HVAC.

1059
01:20:13,907 --> 01:20:18,610
[SPEAKER_03]: And we put it in for, it was HVAC and boiler replacement, those surplus proceeds.

1060
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:24,753
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanna put it back into this high school improvements project and work on some of the HVAC.

1061
01:20:27,875 --> 01:20:31,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so what was the total surplus?

1062
01:20:32,197 --> 01:20:32,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it?

1063
01:20:33,358 --> 01:20:34,478
[SPEAKER_03]: So 703, 489.80 was in the science labs.

1064
01:20:34,518 --> 01:20:34,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1065
01:20:38,137 --> 01:20:43,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And 112, 692, 73 was the surplus in the HVAC boiler replacement.

1066
01:20:43,978 --> 01:20:54,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to combine them all into one high school improvements project for the school committee to make those choices of where it's best serves the schools.

1067
01:20:55,161 --> 01:20:55,421
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1068
01:20:55,781 --> 01:21:07,444
[SPEAKER_15]: So now when we're looking at the money that's come in over the past couple of weeks, we have about $1.9 million in funds that have been injected into our unrestricted government and chapter 70 money.

1069
01:21:08,587 --> 01:21:08,887
[SPEAKER_24]: Correct.

1070
01:21:09,427 --> 01:21:14,330
[SPEAKER_15]: And we had a $5.5 million deficit right around January 30th, June 30th.

1071
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:15,470
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

1072
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:20,652
[SPEAKER_15]: That brings us to about $3.6 million in deficit, restructural deficit right now.

1073
01:21:21,033 --> 01:21:26,095
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we have these two papers that's about another million dollars that we're going to be able to invest it back into our school system.

1074
01:21:26,135 --> 01:21:32,478
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're looking at having a deficit of about $2.6 million as of right now, compared to where we were June 30th.

1075
01:21:32,998 --> 01:21:33,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

1076
01:21:33,778 --> 01:21:35,879
[SPEAKER_15]: We've almost cut the deficit in half over the past 45 days.

1077
01:21:38,425 --> 01:21:38,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1078
01:21:39,065 --> 01:21:39,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.

1079
01:21:40,967 --> 01:21:41,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1080
01:21:41,527 --> 01:21:42,007
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate it.

1081
01:21:42,567 --> 01:21:43,328
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor.

1082
01:21:44,028 --> 01:21:45,749
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scott Kelly.

1083
01:21:45,829 --> 01:21:46,750
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1084
01:21:46,850 --> 01:22:01,179
[SPEAKER_22]: So, correct me if I'm wrong, Alicia, but could this money be allocated for any adjustments that are needed for getting the buildings prepared for COVID?

1085
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:04,801
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that, you know, to get our kids back into the schools?

1086
01:22:06,252 --> 01:22:08,893
[SPEAKER_03]: We would use for that, we have CARES Act funds.

1087
01:22:08,973 --> 01:22:10,913
[SPEAKER_03]: The schools have CARES Act and ESSER money.

1088
01:22:11,013 --> 01:22:16,614
[SPEAKER_03]: The schools have a preparedness grant for preparing for the schools to go back, for the kids to go back.

1089
01:22:17,475 --> 01:22:20,035
[SPEAKER_03]: This one would be more for large capital items.

1090
01:22:20,315 --> 01:22:22,836
[SPEAKER_22]: So- Bathrooms, stuff like that.

1091
01:22:22,996 --> 01:22:31,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the school needed to do their HVAC, the school needed to do their windows, the school needed to redo their entire bathroom, something to that effect.

1092
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:34,480
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so Mike, and that's what I was coming to.

1093
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:47,343
[SPEAKER_22]: I know that part of the issue that I've heard was that the HVAC system had to be updated at the high school to make sure it's safe for our students and teachers to return.

1094
01:22:47,903 --> 01:22:48,503
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that correct?

1095
01:22:48,523 --> 01:22:51,223
[SPEAKER_22]: So is it, is that- They could use it for that.

1096
01:22:51,524 --> 01:22:54,104
[SPEAKER_03]: They could use it for the updating of an HVAC system.

1097
01:22:54,124 --> 01:22:55,124
[SPEAKER_03]: They could use it for that as well.

1098
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:55,884
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

1099
01:22:56,264 --> 01:22:59,425
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you know if that's something they're looking at, do you know, or is that, you don't know?

1100
01:23:00,531 --> 01:23:06,593
[SPEAKER_03]: That I don't know I mean you'd have to reprogram this first and then let the school committee make the decision of how they're going to keep the funds.

1101
01:23:07,194 --> 01:23:08,454
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so much.

1102
01:23:09,715 --> 01:23:10,155
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1103
01:23:11,055 --> 01:23:11,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1104
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:30,715
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to touch upon what Councilor Scott probably mentioned regarding the ventilation.

1105
01:23:31,576 --> 01:23:36,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Alicia, do you know if we're looking at ventilation upgrades to all the schools throughout the system?

1106
01:23:37,642 --> 01:23:39,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the schools are looking at that.

1107
01:23:40,353 --> 01:23:52,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, the reason why I ask is that during the budget, the school committee came out with a laundry list of priorities and recommendations if they had additional money.

1108
01:23:54,117 --> 01:23:58,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Have they put anything in priority for this additional funding?

1109
01:23:58,539 --> 01:24:04,041
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they're well, we haven't approved it, but they're well aware there's money out there now.

1110
01:24:04,681 --> 01:24:07,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Have they put anything in writing to what they're looking at?

1111
01:24:08,459 --> 01:24:11,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen anything and I can't speak on behalf of the school committee.

1112
01:24:13,021 --> 01:24:15,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, but we're being asked to appropriate money.

1113
01:24:16,162 --> 01:24:17,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Right for them to make the decision.

1114
01:24:18,302 --> 01:24:25,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so you appropriate and they have a fund and it's awarded I can create an account for them and then they can figure out, they're going to expend the money.

1115
01:24:26,067 --> 01:24:45,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, my recommendation would be similar to what I think Councilor Scott Pelley was alluding to, that whatever is done with this particular money, that it go towards the eventual reopening of the schools regarding ventilation, safety needs, PPE, whatever else is needed in order and when it's safe to get back into school.

1116
01:24:47,021 --> 01:24:53,568
[SPEAKER_03]: They couldn't use it for PPE because, as I stated, the Mass General Law says it has to be for at least the same borrowing period.

1117
01:24:53,628 --> 01:24:57,352
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would have to be a project that would have a borrowing life of 30 years.

1118
01:24:58,193 --> 01:25:00,735
[SPEAKER_03]: So supplies wouldn't be under that.

1119
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,798
[SPEAKER_03]: We would fund that out of our CARES Act money.

1120
01:25:03,258 --> 01:25:16,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, well, we'll take out the supply stuff, but anything regarding the cost to reopen our schools eventually, I think would be an important expenditure at this particular stage.

1121
01:25:17,258 --> 01:25:19,741
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been talking about restrooms, the

1122
01:25:20,242 --> 01:25:24,424
[SPEAKER_11]: bubblers, water bubblers in the high school for many, many years.

1123
01:25:24,964 --> 01:25:26,484
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's warranted.

1124
01:25:26,765 --> 01:25:45,552
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to see as a part of a contingent, a part of the approval of this council, that we receive an update immediately from the school committee when they do get together and meet to see what their priorities are and what they plan on spending this money for.

1125
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:50,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Council Marks, is that an amendment to the paper?

1126
01:25:50,799 --> 01:25:52,159
[SPEAKER_21]: It is, Mr. President.

1127
01:25:52,179 --> 01:25:52,579
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1128
01:25:52,699 --> 01:25:54,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk, do you have the language on the amendment?

1129
01:25:54,619 --> 01:25:55,080
[SPEAKER_21]: Working on it.

1130
01:26:04,542 --> 01:26:05,622
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Nye, you're up next.

1131
01:26:05,662 --> 01:26:06,542
[SPEAKER_21]: Just give us one second.

1132
01:26:06,922 --> 01:26:09,023
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I read the language I had back?

1133
01:26:09,483 --> 01:26:12,024
[SPEAKER_19]: Please.

1134
01:26:12,304 --> 01:26:17,305
[SPEAKER_19]: Council Marks' amendment is that the council receive an update immediately from the school committee on how the money is going to be spent.

1135
01:26:19,477 --> 01:26:34,611
[SPEAKER_11]: And that we put a priority, Mr. Clerk, that we put a priority on any expenditures for the eventual reopening of public schools regarding safety, i.e.

1136
01:26:34,631 --> 01:26:44,980
[SPEAKER_11]: the ventilation system, security, whatever else needs to be in place in order for us, our teachers, our staff, and our children to safely go back to school.

1137
01:26:45,561 --> 01:26:45,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1138
01:26:49,868 --> 01:26:50,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1139
01:26:52,849 --> 01:26:56,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Night, I'm sorry, Clerk Rodriguez, do you have it?

1140
01:26:56,891 --> 01:26:57,331
[SPEAKER_15]: I got it.

1141
01:26:57,772 --> 01:26:58,332
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Night.

1142
01:26:59,392 --> 01:27:03,114
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a couple of questions for the finance director, through you, Mr. President.

1143
01:27:03,734 --> 01:27:06,716
[SPEAKER_15]: If we fail to reprogram these funds, what happens?

1144
01:27:06,816 --> 01:27:08,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Does it just revert back to the general fund?

1145
01:27:09,677 --> 01:27:11,518
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they just sit back in their capital project.

1146
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:13,718
[SPEAKER_15]: they just sit back in the capital project account.

1147
01:27:14,158 --> 01:27:19,803
[SPEAKER_15]: And by us repurposing or reprogramming these funds, would they be subject to appropriation in the future?

1148
01:27:19,903 --> 01:27:20,964
[SPEAKER_15]: Or is this a blank check?

1149
01:27:20,984 --> 01:27:29,472
[SPEAKER_15]: We're giving a $900,000 blank check to the school department for the capital fund without them having to come back to us and request appropriation.

1150
01:27:29,972 --> 01:27:32,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct, they would not have to request appropriation.

1151
01:27:32,134 --> 01:27:37,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you approve the repurpose, as long as it's for the purpose on what you voted, they would not need to come back.

1152
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:41,832
[SPEAKER_15]: and what's the purpose that we'd be voting now?

1153
01:27:42,432 --> 01:27:45,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now it's for Medford High School Improvements Project.

1154
01:27:45,234 --> 01:27:46,875
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the Medford High School Improvements Project.

1155
01:27:46,915 --> 01:27:54,681
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we're doing right now is making a commitment of about $900,000 to invest in improvements just to Medford High School through the passage of this?

1156
01:27:55,181 --> 01:27:55,442
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1157
01:27:56,042 --> 01:27:59,725
[SPEAKER_15]: If we do this, it would not be subject to appropriation?

1158
01:28:00,285 --> 01:28:00,705
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

1159
01:28:01,206 --> 01:28:07,030
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we don't do it, it would sit in the same account that it's in and would be able to appropriate that money at a later date?

1160
01:28:08,969 --> 01:28:10,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I request.

1161
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:17,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so really, really what this is almost was setting up a revolving account almost for Medford High School school improvements.

1162
01:28:18,094 --> 01:28:21,136
[SPEAKER_15]: That's going to be funded through the surplus that we saved on these bonds.

1163
01:28:21,736 --> 01:28:23,497
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be another capital project account.

1164
01:28:23,637 --> 01:28:29,140
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, it'll be funded through the surplus for them to use right away that because I know that they have many projects that need to get done.

1165
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:36,044
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead of coming before your body to borrow money or free cash, we have these surplus proceeds just sitting there that they could use.

1166
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:38,065
[SPEAKER_15]: And do we know

1167
01:28:39,142 --> 01:28:40,303
[SPEAKER_15]: how we're going to prioritize.

1168
01:28:40,863 --> 01:28:47,266
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this is similar to what Councilor Scott Pelley and Max are talking about, but what are we going to prioritize in terms of where the spending is going to go?

1169
01:28:47,486 --> 01:28:50,287
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's very important.

1170
01:28:50,547 --> 01:28:55,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Without appropriation, then, you know, where that spending goes is going to be very important.

1171
01:28:56,770 --> 01:28:58,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, and that would be up to the school committee.

1172
01:28:58,671 --> 01:29:02,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be able to tell you, I know that they have been talking about HVAC systems.

1173
01:29:02,452 --> 01:29:08,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I've seen and heard about bathrooms, but I don't know what the school committee's plan is, so I can't speak on their behalf.

1174
01:29:10,903 --> 01:29:14,006
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, thank you very much.

1175
01:29:14,026 --> 01:29:14,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1176
01:29:16,948 --> 01:29:18,990
[SPEAKER_22]: This is what I'm getting at, Mr. President.

1177
01:29:20,231 --> 01:29:39,247
[SPEAKER_22]: And forgive me for all your hard work, Alicia, but I would rather, for one person, I'd rather see our school committee prioritize what we need to get us in the building and then come to the city council for appropriation for the fact that I think it's as much as

1178
01:29:40,488 --> 01:29:43,189
[SPEAKER_22]: individuals want their own individual projects go through.

1179
01:29:43,229 --> 01:29:53,574
[SPEAKER_22]: I think right now as a community, we all need to be working to make sure that the air quality is acceptable so our kids can get back to school.

1180
01:29:53,654 --> 01:30:02,418
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that giving an open checkbook to the school committee, I don't have much faith in that.

1181
01:30:02,458 --> 01:30:06,680
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's why I probably won't be voting on this.

1182
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:07,361
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you.

1183
01:30:11,983 --> 01:30:12,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Alicia here.

1184
01:30:13,143 --> 01:30:15,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, just a point of information for some clarity.

1185
01:30:15,904 --> 01:30:21,926
[SPEAKER_03]: The school was awarded a $960,000 grant for the reopening of the schools.

1186
01:30:22,526 --> 01:30:28,108
[SPEAKER_03]: So they do have a grant in place that didn't happen before that your honorable body knew about, so they have that.

1187
01:30:29,159 --> 01:30:35,800
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to that, they also have access to our CARES Act money, which we've been giving them for supplies and things that they need to start.

1188
01:30:36,461 --> 01:30:45,702
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that they're also looking into HVAC, and the HVAC can also go through the CARES Act as well for the COVID-19, because of COVID-19 for the systems.

1189
01:30:46,363 --> 01:30:53,084
[SPEAKER_03]: This money would just give the school committee ability to work on other projects that they need to get done that they couldn't get done.

1190
01:30:53,680 --> 01:31:02,816
[SPEAKER_03]: because they didn't have those funds available so we're just trying to get them the funds I don't know how they want to spend them and I apologize counselors I don't have that information and I wish

1191
01:31:03,518 --> 01:31:05,238
[SPEAKER_22]: Good afternoon, Mr. President.

1192
01:31:05,798 --> 01:31:07,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Good afternoon, Councilor Scarbell.

1193
01:31:07,599 --> 01:31:21,662
[SPEAKER_22]: All due respect, Alicia, I appreciate everything you do, and I know this really doesn't reflect on you at all, but here we are almost to September 1, and we're still talking about what the school committee has to do to prioritize to get our kids back in school, because we've heard nothing.

1194
01:31:22,922 --> 01:31:23,842
[SPEAKER_22]: And this is what I'm saying.

1195
01:31:23,862 --> 01:31:27,603
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that if putting a priority

1196
01:31:28,765 --> 01:31:31,707
[SPEAKER_22]: and getting their list to us to have us vote on it.

1197
01:31:32,067 --> 01:31:33,028
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll move that quicker.

1198
01:31:33,408 --> 01:31:38,952
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's the way we should go because I, like again, like we're late in the game.

1199
01:31:39,212 --> 01:31:45,937
[SPEAKER_22]: We're really late in the game and we still have a lot of very confused parents and teachers and administrators out there.

1200
01:31:45,977 --> 01:31:47,137
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you.

1201
01:31:48,558 --> 01:31:49,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you councilor Scott Kelly.

1202
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1203
01:31:55,645 --> 01:31:58,586
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you and through you to the finance director.

1204
01:32:00,046 --> 01:32:07,248
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, what I heard was that the funds would have to be used only for Medford High School if we appropriated these funds and put them in this account?

1205
01:32:08,589 --> 01:32:12,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I put it in Medford High School Improvement Project.

1206
01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:15,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's what I put, but it can be amended to be whatever schools.

1207
01:32:16,631 --> 01:32:17,771
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was right.

1208
01:32:17,791 --> 01:32:24,773
[SPEAKER_15]: So as it's written right now, if the money stayed in the accounts that they were in, they were subject to appropriation, those funds could be used district wide?

1209
01:32:25,641 --> 01:32:27,342
[SPEAKER_15]: versus just at that exclusive school?

1210
01:32:28,662 --> 01:32:33,045
[SPEAKER_03]: My apologies through the chair, if the accounts that they're currently in our high school accounts.

1211
01:32:33,865 --> 01:32:36,446
[SPEAKER_03]: So I programmed it back to the high school.

1212
01:32:37,847 --> 01:32:41,709
[SPEAKER_03]: You could talk with the school committee if you wanted it to be for the other schools.

1213
01:32:41,829 --> 01:32:48,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wrote it in a sense it was coming from a high school project to go back to a high school improvements project.

1214
01:32:48,672 --> 01:32:50,233
[SPEAKER_03]: So many things about the high schools.

1215
01:32:50,758 --> 01:32:57,940
[SPEAKER_15]: Wouldn't it make more sense for the school committee to come and talk to us when they want us to spend the money versus us giving them the money and then saying, tell us where you're going to spend it later on.

1216
01:33:02,021 --> 01:33:03,701
[SPEAKER_15]: That's just food for thought, but I'm going to thank you.

1217
01:33:03,721 --> 01:33:04,861
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate you clarifying that.

1218
01:33:06,182 --> 01:33:06,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1219
01:33:06,982 --> 01:33:08,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Alicia.

1220
01:33:10,283 --> 01:33:10,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Beers.

1221
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:13,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1222
01:33:14,241 --> 01:33:23,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we do have Charlene Douglas from the MTA here, whom I don't know if there's anything additionally that Charlene might want to add to this conversation.

1223
01:33:24,568 --> 01:33:28,250
[SPEAKER_05]: And secondly, I'll reserve until after if Ms.

1224
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:29,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Douglas has anything to say.

1225
01:33:31,952 --> 01:33:32,933
[SPEAKER_21]: Charlene, would you like to speak?

1226
01:33:36,189 --> 01:33:38,231
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, so thank you, everyone.

1227
01:33:38,271 --> 01:33:40,313
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for allowing me this time.

1228
01:33:42,074 --> 01:33:49,861
[SPEAKER_26]: So I know that we are in negotiations and we are looking at how to safely reopen all the buildings.

1229
01:33:50,321 --> 01:33:58,609
[SPEAKER_26]: So one of the main concerns that teachers, students, parents, everyone has is the air quality, and we are waiting for

1230
01:33:59,376 --> 01:34:06,318
[SPEAKER_26]: an engineering firm to do some assessment of not just the high school, but the other buildings.

1231
01:34:07,098 --> 01:34:21,021
[SPEAKER_26]: We know that in 2017 and 18, there were some air quality reports done that showed a concern regarding the air quality that was at the high school level.

1232
01:34:21,923 --> 01:34:23,505
[SPEAKER_26]: So I know that that is a fact.

1233
01:34:24,526 --> 01:34:45,206
[SPEAKER_26]: I know there were other concerns, you know with the high school with windows not having screens You know water fountains broken various other You know structural issues that we have shared, you know with them and in the community at large and I've shared this even on at school committee meetings so I think that that's one of the main concerns that we have is

1234
01:34:45,606 --> 01:34:57,709
[SPEAKER_26]: And we were looking at the Harvard study, and I don't have the study here with me, but that study, which clearly showed what the air quality flow should be for each and every building.

1235
01:34:57,769 --> 01:35:06,131
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's even in the opening schools dynamic report done by the task force worked on.

1236
01:35:06,822 --> 01:35:09,925
[SPEAKER_26]: And that was shared, you know, with that information is there.

1237
01:35:10,185 --> 01:35:20,375
[SPEAKER_26]: So I do know that that's one of the major concerns we have with going right now back into the buildings, and in the screens and various other things that's and I don't think that's just

1238
01:35:21,368 --> 01:35:22,548
[SPEAKER_26]: um, to the high school.

1239
01:35:22,848 --> 01:35:24,529
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that's also in other schools.

1240
01:35:25,289 --> 01:35:27,550
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, so that's one of the major concerns we have.

1241
01:35:28,030 --> 01:35:34,452
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, as far as, you know, the $960,000 grant, I'm not sure how that is being used.

1242
01:35:34,472 --> 01:35:38,353
[SPEAKER_26]: I know that as we have requested that, um,

1243
01:35:38,837 --> 01:35:48,165
[SPEAKER_26]: that we bring all the teachers to positions back that we have lost, you know, at that time you all aware of that we lost 30 positions.

1244
01:35:48,205 --> 01:35:58,854
[SPEAKER_26]: It is my understanding that the five reading teachers, reading interventions at the elementary schools will be brought back through the chapter 70 funds and various, whatever that may be.

1245
01:35:59,154 --> 01:36:01,296
[SPEAKER_26]: So I don't know the answers to all those questions.

1246
01:36:01,336 --> 01:36:06,180
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, we have asked the school committee and the administration and

1247
01:36:06,647 --> 01:36:10,070
[SPEAKER_26]: They are you know I know they're working on getting some of these things done.

1248
01:36:10,611 --> 01:36:21,661
[SPEAKER_26]: We are looking at what remote and hybrid and all those things look like for us to return to school, but the main concern is right now it's not about, you know, teachers want to get back.

1249
01:36:21,942 --> 01:36:24,324
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a survey today, and 68% of our staff.

1250
01:36:25,890 --> 01:36:38,232
[SPEAKER_26]: right now wants to get back into the buildings, back to work, and the other 32% that have underlying maybe health issues or things like that really are concerned and want to teach remote, which I think will address even some of the parents.

1251
01:36:38,632 --> 01:36:41,853
[SPEAKER_26]: But if we do two plans, we're definitely going to need more teachers.

1252
01:36:42,693 --> 01:36:42,993
[SPEAKER_26]: Sorry.

1253
01:36:44,393 --> 01:36:46,014
[SPEAKER_26]: I hope that answers some questions.

1254
01:36:46,454 --> 01:36:47,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Behrs.

1255
01:36:48,174 --> 01:36:48,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

1256
01:36:48,614 --> 01:36:48,914
[SPEAKER_05]: President.

1257
01:36:48,934 --> 01:36:49,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1258
01:36:49,654 --> 01:36:50,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

1259
01:36:50,114 --> 01:36:50,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Douglas.

1260
01:36:51,374 --> 01:36:54,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, just to me, you know, we know that the

1261
01:36:54,730 --> 01:36:57,091
[SPEAKER_05]: the high school is significantly older than the other schools.

1262
01:36:57,291 --> 01:37:04,796
[SPEAKER_05]: And it does seem to me that whether it's teachers or administrators or parents and students, that there is real need to address these HVAC issues.

1263
01:37:05,056 --> 01:37:07,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I've read some of the similar studies as you miss Douglas.

1264
01:37:07,377 --> 01:37:15,822
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just my position that they should get this money down there as quickly as possible so that we can get projects in motion as quickly as possible.

1265
01:37:16,242 --> 01:37:19,163
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we're saying, come back to us and it's a couple of weeks.

1266
01:37:19,243 --> 01:37:21,845
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that puts us in a position where we're actually,

1267
01:37:22,742 --> 01:37:24,643
[SPEAKER_05]: stringing people along on these big decisions.

1268
01:37:24,703 --> 01:37:29,885
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'd be my suggestion, and how I will be voting, is that we move this money down and get it going.

1269
01:37:29,925 --> 01:37:31,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Order of information, Mr. President.

1270
01:37:31,585 --> 01:37:32,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Order of information, Council of Arts.

1271
01:37:33,726 --> 01:37:40,649
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought we were just told by Alicia that there was funding available for the HVAC and ventilation, other than this money.

1272
01:37:42,429 --> 01:37:43,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Alicia, could you please clarify?

1273
01:37:43,670 --> 01:37:45,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Through the chair, correct.

1274
01:37:46,391 --> 01:37:46,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

1275
01:37:47,031 --> 01:37:47,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the $960,000?

1276
01:37:49,682 --> 01:37:54,207
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a $960,000 grant that they got for reopening the schools.

1277
01:37:54,768 --> 01:38:02,436
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have the CARES Act funds that we could use towards ventilation improvement for COVID-19.

1278
01:38:02,516 --> 01:38:04,078
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is additional funding.

1279
01:38:04,755 --> 01:38:12,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, so we wouldn't be holding any money back regarding ventilation or the needs at the high school at this particular point.

1280
01:38:12,446 --> 01:38:20,618
[SPEAKER_11]: What we would be doing, and I agree with some of my colleagues, is stating before we give out any money that we should be asking, what are the projects?

1281
01:38:20,998 --> 01:38:23,901
[SPEAKER_11]: which makes sense to me at this particular stage.

1282
01:38:24,761 --> 01:38:40,836
[SPEAKER_11]: So at this particular point, Mr. President, I would offer a motion that the council hold back on giving out this particular funding until we do receive a communication from the school committee on what their priorities are and what they intend to spend the, what is it, $815,000 combined?

1283
01:38:40,856 --> 01:38:41,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what it is, Alicia?

1284
01:38:46,762 --> 01:38:55,264
[SPEAKER_03]: seven hundred and three fourteen and the one so yeah eight hundred roughly fifteen yeah you know sixteen thousand yeah

1285
01:38:55,943 --> 01:39:13,491
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would ask, Mr. President, knowing that the CARES Act funding and other additional funding is there to address some of the immediate needs, that this particular money, where we are the appropriating body for this, that we ask that the school committee come back and give us a list of what their priorities and needs are.

1286
01:39:13,891 --> 01:39:18,533
[SPEAKER_11]: And at that point, I don't think there's anyone opposed to addressing the concerns of the school department.

1287
01:39:19,353 --> 01:39:21,274
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd put that in the form of a motion, Mr. President.

1288
01:39:21,454 --> 01:39:23,735
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Lamar, seconded by Mr. President.

1289
01:39:24,537 --> 01:39:26,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Second by Vice President Caviello.

1290
01:39:27,458 --> 01:39:27,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Nye.

1291
01:39:29,118 --> 01:39:29,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Mr. President.

1292
01:39:29,958 --> 01:39:35,079
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's also important to ask the question, how long have these surplus funds remained in that account?

1293
01:39:35,919 --> 01:39:41,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Because if I recollect, I'm thinking that the science labs were probably completed in 2014 or 15.

1294
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:46,482
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe 15, if you don't mind me interjecting, yes.

1295
01:39:47,082 --> 01:39:48,382
[SPEAKER_15]: So were those funds in that account

1296
01:39:49,470 --> 01:39:50,050
[SPEAKER_15]: since that time?

1297
01:39:50,571 --> 01:39:51,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they've just been sitting there.

1298
01:39:52,131 --> 01:39:53,792
[SPEAKER_03]: They've just been sitting in the capital accounts.

1299
01:39:53,932 --> 01:39:58,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been actually since I've come on board, I've been trying to scrub out and clean out most of the accounts.

1300
01:39:59,135 --> 01:40:04,517
[SPEAKER_03]: And these these two accounts are just sitting there with surplus proceeds that the school really needs.

1301
01:40:04,577 --> 01:40:06,998
[SPEAKER_03]: So I figured, you know, I could clean those out as well.

1302
01:40:08,759 --> 01:40:14,102
[SPEAKER_15]: And this isn't a critique of the job you're doing, because I think you're doing a wonderful job, Miss Nunley.

1303
01:40:14,142 --> 01:40:18,904
[SPEAKER_15]: But you know, as the check and balance on

1304
01:40:19,738 --> 01:40:23,339
[SPEAKER_15]: The corner office is the check and balance on spending here in the community.

1305
01:40:23,979 --> 01:40:34,022
[SPEAKER_15]: And as the body responsible to make fiscally responsible decisions, I think it's important that we have an understanding where these funds are going to be spent and when they're going to be spent.

1306
01:40:34,402 --> 01:40:41,625
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm a little uncomfortable writing a blank check and not knowing where those funds are going to be going.

1307
01:40:42,865 --> 01:40:45,886
[SPEAKER_15]: So for that reason, I would support Councilor Mark's motion

1308
01:40:46,683 --> 01:40:52,827
[SPEAKER_15]: that we lay these matters on the table until such time as we can receive correspondence from the school committee as to where they intend to spend these funds.

1309
01:40:53,347 --> 01:40:59,930
[SPEAKER_15]: I have all the confidence and faith in the world and John McLaughlin, I think he's done an excellent job since he's been appointed the facilities managers for the school department.

1310
01:41:00,271 --> 01:41:02,172
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know that these monies will not be wasted.

1311
01:41:02,932 --> 01:41:05,013
[SPEAKER_15]: However, we have a job to do here as well.

1312
01:41:05,193 --> 01:41:06,114
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's, you know,

1313
01:41:07,092 --> 01:41:09,774
[SPEAKER_15]: provide a check and balance on the spending and the buck stops here.

1314
01:41:10,334 --> 01:41:16,058
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't think it's appropriate for us to write a check for 800 and some $1,000 and not know where that money is going.

1315
01:41:16,419 --> 01:41:21,122
[SPEAKER_15]: So for those reasons, I'll be supporting Councilor Mark's resolution to amend the resolution.

1316
01:41:22,663 --> 01:41:23,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Councilor Knight.

1317
01:41:24,004 --> 01:41:26,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see Councilor Beers and then Councilor Carviel.

1318
01:41:27,466 --> 01:41:28,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1319
01:41:28,627 --> 01:41:32,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just say our next meeting is in two weeks.

1320
01:41:33,130 --> 01:41:34,971
[SPEAKER_05]: When is the next school committee meeting after that?

1321
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:41,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we understand the conditions of the high school and we understand the costs of HVAC.

1322
01:41:41,907 --> 01:41:49,356
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we're here in three or four weeks, and the reason that projects aren't bid out or that projects aren't underway is because we chose not to send the money down tonight.

1323
01:41:49,837 --> 01:41:52,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want the city council to be blamed for that.

1324
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:56,025
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we understand exactly how tense this reopening question is.

1325
01:41:56,085 --> 01:41:59,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we should be putting all resources possible into getting that reopening done.

1326
01:41:59,849 --> 01:42:01,832
[SPEAKER_05]: 900,000, hopefully 900,000 is enough.

1327
01:42:01,872 --> 01:42:02,773
[SPEAKER_05]: But I really don't think-

1328
01:42:10,587 --> 01:42:17,271
[SPEAKER_11]: So what is the actual cost to repair and update the HVA system at the high school?

1329
01:42:18,512 --> 01:42:19,693
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't know, Mr. President.

1330
01:42:20,093 --> 01:42:21,694
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't know.

1331
01:42:22,034 --> 01:42:24,655
[SPEAKER_11]: This is all conjecture, Mr. President.

1332
01:42:24,675 --> 01:42:27,237
[SPEAKER_11]: We have no idea what the actual cost is.

1333
01:42:27,697 --> 01:42:36,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, and to just go through something blindly, because even if we appropriate this money and we still need millions of dollars, where are we then, Mr. President?

1334
01:42:37,079 --> 01:42:45,960
[SPEAKER_11]: So we should be getting a report from the school side telling us exactly what the cost is, what they're going to do, and what monies are needed, Mr. President.

1335
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:48,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1336
01:42:48,781 --> 01:42:51,781
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how you operate government not knowing that information.

1337
01:42:51,801 --> 01:42:53,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1338
01:42:53,182 --> 01:42:55,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, counsel.

1339
01:42:55,662 --> 01:42:56,022
[SPEAKER_05]: beers.

1340
01:42:56,602 --> 01:43:00,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope where we are isn't that people aren't in the school buildings because we made this choice.

1341
01:43:00,443 --> 01:43:01,604
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my position.

1342
01:43:01,784 --> 01:43:03,084
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to cost millions of dollars.

1343
01:43:03,904 --> 01:43:04,685
[SPEAKER_05]: The money is needed.

1344
01:43:04,705 --> 01:43:11,867
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't I'm voting no to table because I'm not going to be responsible for delaying schools reopening.

1345
01:43:12,047 --> 01:43:12,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1346
01:43:12,687 --> 01:43:13,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Surprise, surprise.

1347
01:43:15,308 --> 01:43:18,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

1348
01:43:18,509 --> 01:43:19,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion on the floor to table?

1349
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:22,100
[SPEAKER_14]: apparently.

1350
01:43:22,501 --> 01:43:27,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks, you said- It was a motion that was made and seconded and debate continued, Mr. President.

1351
01:43:27,524 --> 01:43:31,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, because he said hold back, I should have had you clarify.

1352
01:43:31,467 --> 01:43:34,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks, your motion is to table, am I correct?

1353
01:43:35,670 --> 01:43:42,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion is to table, Mr. President, until we get a correspondence back from the school committee regarding what their priorities are.

1354
01:43:42,895 --> 01:43:50,541
[SPEAKER_11]: And if it's the HVA system, Mr. President, we should know how they're going to spend it and what it's going to cost before we allocate money.

1355
01:43:51,090 --> 01:43:54,593
[SPEAKER_10]: On a motion by Councilor Marks, motion to table is not debatable.

1356
01:43:54,973 --> 01:43:57,635
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize before that the language is a little different.

1357
01:43:57,695 --> 01:43:58,456
[SPEAKER_10]: So I apologize.

1358
01:43:58,476 --> 01:44:00,938
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of Councilor Marks to table, seconded by?

1359
01:44:00,958 --> 01:44:01,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

1360
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Urtubez, please call the roll.

1361
01:44:05,882 --> 01:44:06,843
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is to table.

1362
01:44:06,863 --> 01:44:07,723
[SPEAKER_10]: 120-516.

1363
01:44:07,743 --> 01:44:11,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Behrs.

1364
01:44:12,307 --> 01:44:12,667
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1365
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:16,730
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Caraballo.

1366
01:44:17,071 --> 01:44:17,271
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

01:44:21,365 --> 01:44:21,845
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight.

1368
01:44:22,226 --> 01:44:22,506
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

01:44:26,509 --> 01:44:27,090
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks.

1370
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:28,010
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1371
01:44:30,352 --> 01:44:30,913
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Morrell.

1372
01:44:31,473 --> 01:44:31,754
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

01:44:34,896 --> 01:44:35,637
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1374
01:44:36,157 --> 01:44:36,377
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_19]: President Falco.

1376
01:44:41,642 --> 01:44:41,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1377
01:44:42,042 --> 01:44:43,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

1378
01:44:44,384 --> 01:44:45,585
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion is tabled.

1379
01:44:47,793 --> 01:44:48,613
[SPEAKER_10]: 20-517.

1380
01:44:49,274 --> 01:45:11,280
[SPEAKER_10]: To the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council, City of Memphis, Massachusetts, 02155, dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that the honorable body reprogram surplus proceeds to the amount of $112,692.73 for the Memphis High School HVAC boiler replacement project to the Memphis High School improvements project.

1381
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:12,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to table.

1382
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:14,520
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of council, I'll make the table.

1383
01:45:15,941 --> 01:45:16,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by?

1384
01:45:17,173 --> 01:45:17,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1390
01:45:38,851 --> 01:45:39,352
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight.

1391
01:45:40,072 --> 01:45:40,392
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1392

[SPEAKER_10]: The motion passed.

1402
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:00,301
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion is tabled.

1403
01:46:04,444 --> 01:46:05,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion to revert?

1404
01:46:05,545 --> 01:46:07,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to revert back to the regular order of business.

1405
01:46:07,387 --> 01:46:10,649
[SPEAKER_10]: A motion to Councilor Moxley to revert to the regular order of business, seconded by?

1406
01:46:11,110 --> 01:46:11,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

01:46:19,164 --> 01:46:19,964
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Caraballo.

1411
01:46:20,205 --> 01:46:20,465
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1412
01:46:21,185 --> 01:46:21,646
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight.

1413
01:46:21,926 --> 01:46:22,206
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1414
01:46:22,947 --> 01:46:23,487
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks.

1415
01:46:23,808 --> 01:46:24,108
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1416
01:46:25,029 --> 01:46:25,609
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Morrell.

1417
01:46:26,029 --> 01:46:26,290
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1418
01:46:27,731 --> 01:46:28,511
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1419
01:46:28,872 --> 01:46:29,052
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1420
01:46:29,432 --> 01:46:30,133
[SPEAKER_19]: President Falco.

1421
01:46:30,553 --> 01:46:33,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

1422
01:46:33,716 --> 01:46:39,981
[SPEAKER_10]: 20-507 offered by Councilor Behrs, whereas residents of Medford requested that the

1423
01:46:40,576 --> 01:46:51,019
[SPEAKER_10]: City of Medford hang a banner stating Black Lives Matter at Medford City Hall as a statement of solidarity and support to begin to address the history of racism and discrimination in our community.

1424
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:52,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, Mr. President?

1425
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:56,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, Councilor Caviello.

1426
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:57,060
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to show you.

1427
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:57,600
[SPEAKER_28]: Point of order.

1428
01:46:57,981 --> 01:47:01,782
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, I would think Rule 21 applies on this motion?

1429
01:47:06,169 --> 01:47:09,774
[SPEAKER_10]: So rule 21 would be that it doesn't come up for another 90 days, I believe?

1430
01:47:09,794 --> 01:47:10,555
[SPEAKER_28]: That's correct.

1431
01:47:10,575 --> 01:47:19,627
[SPEAKER_28]: This was discussed and we are awaiting a decision from the mayor's office unless Chief of Staff Rodriguez has an answer for us this evening.

1432
01:47:20,668 --> 01:47:25,093
[SPEAKER_05]: My understanding is that a decision has been made by the mayor's office and this is requesting a copy of that decision.

1433
01:47:25,213 --> 01:47:27,956
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not the same motion as last month.

1434
01:47:27,996 --> 01:47:28,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1435
01:47:28,496 --> 01:47:30,198
[SPEAKER_28]: Staff is on the call here.

1436
01:47:30,519 --> 01:47:32,941
[SPEAKER_28]: Maybe he could enlighten us to the decision.

1437
01:47:33,422 --> 01:47:35,143
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, can we finish the reading, please?

1438
01:47:35,284 --> 01:47:39,608
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, I'm going to read the rest of this, okay?

1439
01:47:40,129 --> 01:47:42,591
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we'll go from there, okay?

1440
01:47:43,052 --> 01:47:43,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1441
01:47:44,763 --> 01:47:49,586
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to be clear, the councilor's motion is to ask for the chairman to make a ruling as to whether or not this paper is out of order?

1442
01:47:49,946 --> 01:47:54,729
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do not think it is out of order because I think this is different from the original resolution was asking for a banner.

1443
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:55,950
[SPEAKER_10]: This is asking for an opinion.

1444
01:47:56,050 --> 01:48:01,734
[SPEAKER_15]: So am I- The original paper that we sent to the administration was to get an opinion as to what the policy was, wasn't it?

1445
01:48:01,754 --> 01:48:03,736
[SPEAKER_15]: That's correct.

1446
01:48:04,056 --> 01:48:07,078
[SPEAKER_10]: The policy was asked what the policy was.

1447
01:48:07,598 --> 01:48:09,960
[SPEAKER_10]: This here is asking for an opinion.

1448
01:48:13,763 --> 01:48:18,268
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why I don't think that this is, to me, this is not a, doesn't come out of rule 21.

1449
01:48:18,548 --> 01:48:20,950
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my, that's how I feel as the chair.

1450
01:48:22,252 --> 01:48:26,236
[SPEAKER_15]: So are you making the ruling on the motion now, or are you reading the paper into the record?

1451
01:48:26,756 --> 01:48:28,618
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to, well, I told you how I feel.

1452
01:48:28,658 --> 01:48:29,499
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to read it in.

1453
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:35,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I have questions myself, to be honest with you, but I was going to read it in and take it from there.

1454
01:48:36,446 --> 01:48:41,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so then what we'll do is read the paper into the record and then we'll address the council's motion.

1455
01:48:43,151 --> 01:48:44,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's that's fine.

1456
01:48:44,131 --> 01:48:45,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1457
01:48:45,912 --> 01:49:01,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States in Rosenberger versus rectors and visitors of University of Virginia established the government speech doctor recognizing that a government entity is entitled to say what it wishes and select views it wants to express and whereas the government

1458
01:49:02,214 --> 01:49:21,006
[SPEAKER_10]: speech doctrine has been affirmed and reinforced by Supreme Court decisions including but not limited to Russ v. Sullivan, Johans v. Livestock Marketing Association, Pleasant Grove City v. Summum Walker v. Texas, Division Sons of Confederate Veterans, and

1459
01:49:21,752 --> 01:49:46,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Mattel versus Tan, and whereas placing a banner on Memphis City Hall meets the multi-factor test defined in Summum and Walker of historic use of the building, including banners to convey government messages to the public's, number two, the public's close identification of messages and signage placed on Memphis City Hall with the city government and

1460
01:49:47,172 --> 01:49:54,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Number three, the City of Medford's maintenance of effective control over the messages conveyed, and whereas in 2018 the U.S.

1461
01:49:54,821 --> 01:50:04,172
[SPEAKER_10]: District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Shurtleff versus City of Boston denied the request for injunction of a plaintiff requesting the flag of a specific flag

1462
01:50:04,632 --> 01:50:25,616
[SPEAKER_10]: at Boston City Hall using the government speech doctrine in multi-factor test defined in Summum and Walker, and whereas in 2019, the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the decision of the District Court in Shurtleff with a three-judge panel deciding unanimously to reject the plaintiff's appeal.

1463
01:50:25,676 --> 01:50:32,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the city administration provide a summary explanation of the opinion

1464
01:50:34,005 --> 01:50:39,587
[SPEAKER_10]: regarding banners on Method City Hall and how it is possible that such an opinion can ignore the U.S.

1465
01:50:39,627 --> 01:50:48,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Constitution's government speech doctrine as deemed and affirmed by decades of precedent of the Supreme Court of the United States.

1466
01:50:49,210 --> 01:51:02,275
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that being said, Councilor Beers, if I may, when I read this, the last sentence, be it resolved that the Method City Council, that the city administration provide a summary explanation of the opinion

1467
01:51:04,858 --> 01:51:08,761
[SPEAKER_10]: I incorrectly if I'm wrong, I checked with the clerk.

1468
01:51:10,222 --> 01:51:13,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we receive an opinion back from the administration on this?

1469
01:51:13,145 --> 01:51:16,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I don't have any of my emails in opinion on this.

1470
01:51:16,847 --> 01:51:20,851
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the piece that I'm struggling with.

1471
01:51:21,311 --> 01:51:23,593
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you could speak on that, I would greatly appreciate it.

1472
01:51:24,794 --> 01:51:26,395
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you asking me to speak on that, Mr. President?

1473
01:51:26,535 --> 01:51:28,657
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm asking that Councilor Beers.

1474
01:51:29,077 --> 01:51:29,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1475
01:51:30,078 --> 01:51:31,159
[SPEAKER_16]: What about the council's point?

1476
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,821
[SPEAKER_10]: We still have Councilor Nye, I'm sorry.

1477
01:51:37,281 --> 01:51:38,903
[SPEAKER_15]: So what about the Councilor's point of order?

1478
01:51:40,984 --> 01:51:42,406
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Carviello made a point of order.

1479
01:51:42,446 --> 01:51:44,748
[SPEAKER_15]: He asked for a ruling on the decorum and appropriateness of the paper.

1480
01:51:45,188 --> 01:51:47,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and I thought it was appropriate to move forward with it.

1481
01:51:48,411 --> 01:51:52,254
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're making a ruling and determining that the paper is not out of order and that it's appropriate?

1482
01:51:52,634 --> 01:51:52,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

1483
01:51:53,455 --> 01:51:55,536
[SPEAKER_15]: I question the ruling of the Chair.

1484
01:51:55,556 --> 01:51:57,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Councilor Nye questions the ruling of the Chair.

1485
01:51:58,819 --> 01:51:59,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a second?

1486
01:52:00,501 --> 01:52:01,221
[SPEAKER_28]: Second, Mr. President.

1487
01:52:01,521 --> 01:52:03,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Second by Vice President Carviello.

1488
01:52:05,697 --> 01:52:06,718
[SPEAKER_10]: please call the roll.

1489
01:52:07,078 --> 01:52:08,139
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, your question is the same as mine.

1490
01:52:08,159 --> 01:52:15,704
[SPEAKER_05]: That is why I put this on the agenda.

1491
01:52:37,226 --> 01:52:37,506
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1492
01:52:41,430 --> 01:52:42,011
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Morrell.

1493
01:52:42,671 --> 01:52:42,892
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1494
01:52:46,955 --> 01:52:47,736
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1495
01:52:48,097 --> 01:52:48,317
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1496
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:52,080
[SPEAKER_19]: President Falco.

1497
01:52:52,961 --> 01:52:59,628
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1498
01:52:59,708 --> 01:53:00,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you get everyone, Councilor?

1499
01:53:01,402 --> 01:53:02,723
[SPEAKER_19]: You forgot a little old me.

1500
01:53:03,423 --> 01:53:04,103
[SPEAKER_19]: I skipped him.

1501
01:53:04,123 --> 01:53:04,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Mr. President.

1502
01:53:04,483 --> 01:53:06,444
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's four to three that the, in the questioning of the ruling.

1503
01:53:06,464 --> 01:53:07,124
[SPEAKER_19]: Appeal stands.

1504
01:53:07,144 --> 01:53:09,425
[SPEAKER_19]: So Councilor, Councilor Lange.

1505
01:53:28,371 --> 01:53:29,412
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be on next meeting.

1506
01:53:29,792 --> 01:53:30,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1507
01:53:30,312 --> 01:53:35,616
[SPEAKER_15]: So they, so they, so that the calendar wrote, um, yeah, so the papers were a lot of water and, uh, that's it, right?

1508
01:53:36,036 --> 01:53:36,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1509
01:53:36,216 --> 01:53:39,698
[SPEAKER_10]: The paper has been ruled out of water by, uh, by a vote of four to three.

1510
01:53:40,439 --> 01:53:40,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Call for the orders.

1511
01:53:40,879 --> 01:53:41,479
[SPEAKER_10]: The name is present.

1512
01:53:42,860 --> 01:53:43,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, let's see.

1513
01:53:45,362 --> 01:53:48,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Two zero dash five one zero offered by vice-president Caviello be it resolved.

1514
01:53:48,444 --> 01:53:58,210
[SPEAKER_10]: The method city council request that chief Buckley examine the hiring of using recently retired police officers for details that go unnamed in the interest of public safety.

1515
01:53:58,996 --> 01:53:59,798
[SPEAKER_10]: First President Caviello.

1516
01:54:00,198 --> 01:54:00,860
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1517
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:07,473
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, many cities have called out the Massachusetts youths reaching their retired offices to cover details.

1518
01:54:08,628 --> 01:54:09,209
[SPEAKER_28]: in their cities.

1519
01:54:10,309 --> 01:54:17,713
[SPEAKER_28]: City of Medford, where there's so many projects going on right now, many projects go uncovered with details.

1520
01:54:18,034 --> 01:54:27,459
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you recall, a few years ago, it resulted in the death of a resident who fell into a hole because there was no police officer in detail.

1521
01:54:28,399 --> 01:54:32,482
[SPEAKER_28]: And I, you know, you drive by and I see, I see Allentown policemen, Baltimore police, every policeman.

1522
01:54:33,502 --> 01:54:34,483
[SPEAKER_28]: There's no reason why

1523
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:40,505
[SPEAKER_28]: We can't be using the recent retired offices, the covered details when they go uncovered.

1524
01:54:40,765 --> 01:54:44,328
[SPEAKER_28]: And also the city also makes money on these details.

1525
01:54:44,868 --> 01:54:55,217
[SPEAKER_28]: So I would request an answer from the chief on whether he would, if he's going to entertain the idea of using them or not.

1526
01:54:57,359 --> 01:54:58,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Vice President Carriello.

1527
01:54:58,620 --> 01:54:59,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1528
01:55:01,722 --> 01:55:05,824
[SPEAKER_15]: I certainly can appreciate the spirit of the resolution that's been brought forward.

1529
01:55:06,284 --> 01:55:20,311
[SPEAKER_15]: However, based upon my background in organized labor and representing police unions in the past, this is something that may strike a concern relative to collective bargaining rights, collective bargaining agreements and the like, Mr. President.

1530
01:55:20,964 --> 01:55:34,977
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, I'll be voting in opposition of this resolution this evening, just because I don't have enough knowledge understanding as to what the collective bargaining agreement says between the Metro Police Performance Association in the city relative to construction details and the like.

1531
01:55:35,838 --> 01:55:39,281
[SPEAKER_15]: I certainly believe that public safety comes first and public safety is our number one job.

1532
01:55:39,782 --> 01:55:41,223
[SPEAKER_15]: But with that being said, I also don't want to

1533
01:55:41,683 --> 01:55:47,085
[SPEAKER_15]: tread on water that's something that's outside our purview and subject to the mandatory requirements of collective bargaining.

1534
01:55:47,125 --> 01:55:48,985
[SPEAKER_15]: So for those reasons, I'll be voting against this paper.

1535
01:55:49,045 --> 01:55:57,667
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, I think the patrolman's representative union is on the call.

1536
01:56:00,168 --> 01:56:01,248
[SPEAKER_28]: If you'd like to speak to that.

1537
01:56:01,629 --> 01:56:06,350
[SPEAKER_15]: I might be more comfortable supporting it after I hear from him then, Mr. President, but thank you very much.

1538
01:56:06,430 --> 01:56:10,171
[SPEAKER_28]: I think the patrolman's, Harold McGivory is on the call.

1539
01:56:10,703 --> 01:56:11,584
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll find him in one minute.

1540
01:56:11,784 --> 01:56:13,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get Councilor Marks has his hand up.

1541
01:56:13,926 --> 01:56:14,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks.

1542
01:56:15,487 --> 01:56:16,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1543
01:56:16,508 --> 01:56:19,090
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Councilor Caviello for putting this on tonight.

1544
01:56:19,771 --> 01:56:25,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Clearly, Mr. President, we can't circumvent any collective bargaining issues or concerns.

1545
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:30,359
[SPEAKER_11]: So if that indeed is the case, then this will be ironed out in that particular realm.

1546
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:37,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, what Councilor Carviello just alluded to is a serious public safety concern in our community.

1547
01:56:38,403 --> 01:56:43,406
[SPEAKER_11]: We roughly have 35 details per week that go unfilled.

1548
01:56:44,046 --> 01:56:54,131
[SPEAKER_11]: That means that when an outside entity, utility company that wants to do business in the community reaches out to the Meffitt Police Department, they can't find anyone

1549
01:56:55,506 --> 01:57:00,787
[SPEAKER_11]: on the police department to fill these particular public safety concerns.

1550
01:57:01,367 --> 01:57:05,188
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is very concerning to me, Mr. President, as one member of the council.

1551
01:57:05,948 --> 01:57:22,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Additionally, Mr. President, as Councilor Caviello alluded to, the city gets an administrative fee on every detail, whether it's someone from the city of Method doing the detail, or if it's someone from the Somerville Police Department that's filling in, or the Everett Police Department.

1552
01:57:22,512 --> 01:57:23,673
[SPEAKER_11]: We get a 15% administrative fee.

1553
01:57:25,753 --> 01:57:37,696
[SPEAKER_11]: If you add up the number of details that go unfilled in the course of the year, we're talking roughly $100,000 that the city of Method is leaving on the table, Mr. President.

1554
01:57:38,277 --> 01:57:40,457
[SPEAKER_11]: We just went through a budget crisis.

1555
01:57:40,497 --> 01:57:42,538
[SPEAKER_11]: We just talked about laying teachers off.

1556
01:57:42,758 --> 01:57:45,419
[SPEAKER_11]: We just talked about not rehiring police and fire.

1557
01:57:45,719 --> 01:57:47,599
[SPEAKER_11]: And here we are leaving $100,000 on the table, Mr. President.

1558
01:57:50,300 --> 01:57:55,347
[SPEAKER_11]: which is a financial concern as well as a public safety concern, Mr. President.

1559
01:57:55,707 --> 01:58:03,357
[SPEAKER_11]: We also had, if people recall back some years ago, we had a fatality at one of these work sites, Mr. President, on Salt Street.

1560
01:58:04,939 --> 01:58:08,544
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is of grave concern in our community, Mr. President.

1561
01:58:08,944 --> 01:58:11,967
[SPEAKER_11]: for our offices as well as public safety.

1562
01:58:12,607 --> 01:58:28,921
[SPEAKER_11]: And I agree with Councilor Caviello that indeed, if we can get retired police officers that are willing to do this particular work, Mr. President, and work it out with the unions and work it out with collective bargaining, this is a win-win for the community.

1563
01:58:29,702 --> 01:58:35,907
[SPEAKER_11]: So I support this wholeheartedly, Mr. President, and I look forward to hearing from, I believe,

1564
01:58:36,828 --> 01:58:41,650
[SPEAKER_11]: The union rep is also on, and I look forward to hearing his comments as well, Mr. President.

1565
01:58:42,650 --> 01:58:43,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1566
01:58:43,590 --> 01:58:48,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see here.

1567
01:58:48,472 --> 01:58:57,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Harold, I'm going to unmute you.

1568
01:58:57,515 --> 01:58:58,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Harold, you should be on.

1569
01:58:59,276 --> 01:58:59,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me?

1570
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:00,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1571
01:59:01,116 --> 01:59:01,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for joining us.

1572
01:59:02,757 --> 01:59:03,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1573
01:59:04,758 --> 01:59:05,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Harold McGilvrey.

1574
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:11,572
[SPEAKER_06]: 100 Main Street, representing the Method Police Patrolmen's Association.

1575
01:59:13,673 --> 01:59:17,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I did have a discussion with Chief Buckley in regards to this.

1576
01:59:18,795 --> 01:59:29,939
[SPEAKER_06]: The Patrolmen's Union presented the chief with a home rule petition that would have gone in front of a state delegation.

1577
01:59:29,959 --> 01:59:36,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I did speak with Representative Donato about taking care of that.

1578
01:59:38,250 --> 01:59:48,373
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also worked on a policy in regards to retired offices working traffic assignments.

1579
01:59:49,073 --> 01:59:53,854
[SPEAKER_06]: It pretty much fell in line with what every other city in town does.

1580
01:59:55,895 --> 01:59:57,996
[SPEAKER_06]: We also brought this up to the mayor's office.

1581
01:59:58,356 --> 02:00:03,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been waiting on Chief of Staff Rodriguez to touch base with me.

1582
02:00:03,077 --> 02:00:06,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I know he's on the call for a couple of weeks now.

1583
02:00:07,746 --> 02:00:13,628
[SPEAKER_06]: We're meeting on Thursday on a separate issue, and I was going to readdress the issue then.

1584
02:00:14,609 --> 02:00:33,136
[SPEAKER_06]: But at this time, our CBA does say that sworn officers will perform the jobs in the city, but we're willing to open it up for retired officers like our

1585
02:00:34,755 --> 02:00:37,456
[SPEAKER_06]: brothers and sisters in the surrounding communities have already done.

1586
02:00:37,476 --> 02:00:41,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll take any questions if anybody has any questions.

1587
02:00:43,077 --> 02:00:43,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Through the chair.

1588
02:00:44,677 --> 02:00:44,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1589
02:00:45,017 --> 02:00:45,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1590
02:00:45,937 --> 02:00:47,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. McGilvrey.

1591
02:00:47,258 --> 02:00:47,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Any questions?

1592
02:00:47,818 --> 02:00:48,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Councilor Knight.

1593
02:00:49,698 --> 02:01:02,601
[SPEAKER_15]: So from what I'm taking back from this, Mr. McGilvrey, through the president to you, is that this would require legislative action by the city council to pass a home rule petition and then get that up to Beacon Hill in order for this to become a reality?

1594
02:01:03,421 --> 02:01:03,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

1595
02:01:07,790 --> 02:01:10,472
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the language already done.

1596
02:01:12,133 --> 02:01:18,977
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of watching the TV, and I don't know if this is, I'm talking on my phone, but I'm watching this on TV, so I don't know how this is coming across.

1597
02:01:19,278 --> 02:01:21,039
[SPEAKER_15]: Like a million bucks, I can hear you perfectly fine.

1598
02:01:21,199 --> 02:01:22,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, fine.

1599
02:01:24,361 --> 02:01:24,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1600
02:01:24,501 --> 02:01:25,202
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so.

1601
02:01:25,262 --> 02:01:27,143
[SPEAKER_06]: You're correct, you're correct, Councilor, you're correct.

1602
02:01:27,683 --> 02:01:28,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, but it would require some,

1603
02:01:30,829 --> 02:01:47,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Bargaining at some I mean if the home rule petition passes it would supersede to collect a bargaining agreement But right now your contract would only allow for sworn officers to perform details correct, we would Yeah, correct, we would we would It wouldn't supersede our CBA.

1604
02:01:47,639 --> 02:01:49,620
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be something that we agreed to through our seat.

1605
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:53,722
[SPEAKER_15]: I meant to get Yeah, okay and

1606
02:01:54,195 --> 02:02:03,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now, when details go unfilled, are there any other entities or bodies that are eligible to participate if a traffic detail's not filled?

1607
02:02:03,138 --> 02:02:05,098
[SPEAKER_15]: Do surrounding communities come and help out in MedFed?

1608
02:02:05,118 --> 02:02:07,059
[SPEAKER_15]: Does the Sheriff's Department come and help out in MedFed?

1609
02:02:07,119 --> 02:02:13,641
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there other entities that are helping out now that, you know, help them perform some of these tasks and duties?

1610
02:02:15,661 --> 02:02:20,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, the way it works, we have surrounding cities and towns

1611
02:02:21,354 --> 02:02:35,938
[SPEAKER_06]: coming in, we have Melrose coming in a lot lately, we have Malden coming in a lot lately, because the workload in those cities and towns isn't as great as it is right now in Medford and say Somerville, Cambridge, Arlington, those places seem to be busy.

1612
02:02:36,738 --> 02:02:48,722
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to say this, it's a seasonal situation, like we're right now at the peak time for construction work, and it's usually between June

1613
02:02:50,490 --> 02:02:54,811
[SPEAKER_06]: to October where we might have trouble filling assignments.

1614
02:02:55,972 --> 02:02:59,593
[SPEAKER_06]: We can fill assignments pretty much the rest of the year.

1615
02:03:00,253 --> 02:03:06,955
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just right now there's a lot going on and we have offices on vacation and other things going on.

1616
02:03:06,975 --> 02:03:09,596
[SPEAKER_06]: There are days where we fill them all and there are days where we don't.

1617
02:03:11,977 --> 02:03:14,777
[SPEAKER_06]: But this would definitely help us out.

1618
02:03:17,217 --> 02:03:17,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good to me.

1619
02:03:18,438 --> 02:03:18,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1620
02:03:20,119 --> 02:03:39,809
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, if I could amend the paper to request that the city administration provide us with a draft copy of the homework petition that's been presented, I think that would be helpful in us as we start to kick off this discussion because it does sound like a win-win if the collective bargaining agreement in the union's willing to be flexible and work with the community to provide this service, then I'm all for it.

1621
02:03:41,710 --> 02:03:45,612
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to offer that in the form of an amendment that the draft homework petition be provided to the council.

1622
02:03:46,455 --> 02:03:47,156
[SPEAKER_21]: Second, Mr. President.

1623
02:03:47,796 --> 02:03:48,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1624
02:03:51,559 --> 02:03:52,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I say something also?

1625
02:03:53,441 --> 02:03:53,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1626
02:03:54,302 --> 02:03:55,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Montgomery, please continue.

1627
02:03:56,564 --> 02:03:56,884
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1628
02:03:57,665 --> 02:04:07,313
[SPEAKER_06]: So I also want to just make clear that we feel that there is no substitute for a trained police officer performing these duties.

1629
02:04:07,734 --> 02:04:13,939
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a situation today where a vehicle drove driving erratically.

1630
02:04:14,973 --> 02:04:25,081
[SPEAKER_06]: hit a pole on Winthrop Street, the detail officer witnessed it, he was able to call in the plate, sack the car, and the Winchester police intercepted the car.

1631
02:04:26,201 --> 02:04:37,090
[SPEAKER_06]: In Winchester, there was a small pursuit and we were able to apprehend the suspect.

1632
02:04:40,072 --> 02:04:41,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Having police officers on the street,

1633
02:04:43,251 --> 02:04:49,857
[SPEAKER_06]: doing these assignments, it supplements our, for lack of a better term, manpower.

1634
02:04:50,618 --> 02:04:57,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's times like this right now where we're going in the wrong direction, where our numbers are declining.

1635
02:04:57,483 --> 02:05:05,110
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we have officers on the street performing these duties, it's more eyes and ears on the street.

1636
02:05:05,450 --> 02:05:11,095
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that that makes the community at whole, at least the majority of the community, feel safe.

1637
02:05:16,317 --> 02:05:17,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions from the council?

1638
02:05:20,740 --> 02:05:21,301
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President?

1639
02:05:22,181 --> 02:05:22,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1640
02:05:22,462 --> 02:05:24,023
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I jump in?

1641
02:05:24,303 --> 02:05:26,364
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpelli lost his connection.

1642
02:05:26,424 --> 02:05:27,305
[SPEAKER_19]: He's dialed back in.

1643
02:05:27,325 --> 02:05:28,466
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm trying to get him unmuted.

1644
02:05:28,506 --> 02:05:31,288
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't, I can't get him unmuted.

1645
02:05:31,909 --> 02:05:32,969
[SPEAKER_19]: He may have a question.

1646
02:05:39,374 --> 02:05:41,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm trying to unmute him too and I'm not having any luck.

1647
02:05:44,462 --> 02:05:46,563
[SPEAKER_05]: He may be separately muted on his phone.

1648
02:05:50,285 --> 02:05:52,046
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpello, are you muted on your own phone?

1649
02:06:00,270 --> 02:06:11,696
[SPEAKER_10]: While we're trying to work that out, Harold, can I, if you don't mind me asking a quick question or, so as far as, I'm just trying to think from a risk standpoint, is there any risk to the city if,

1650
02:06:14,553 --> 02:06:19,556
[SPEAKER_10]: if you had a retired police officer, what if they got hurt doing the detail?

1651
02:06:19,616 --> 02:06:25,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a risk to the community there or risk to the city financially?

1652
02:06:27,681 --> 02:06:31,764
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not covered by 111F, that's in the agreement.

1653
02:06:33,905 --> 02:06:38,448
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as workers' comp goes, that would be something I'd have to run by legal counsel.

1654
02:06:40,067 --> 02:06:56,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it's, it's, it's, it's a good question and it's something the city should in their due diligence, uh, explore and as a, as a, as a, as an association, a union standpoint, these, these people aren't members of our, these individuals won't be members of our union.

1655
02:06:56,834 --> 02:07:04,917
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not dues paying members, but obviously if they were, um, injured, um,

1656
02:07:05,859 --> 02:07:16,802
[SPEAKER_06]: In the line of duty, yes, I would think that the city would be responsible for their medical coverage and any other expenses.

1657
02:07:16,922 --> 02:07:19,423
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, these are gonna be police officers.

1658
02:07:20,083 --> 02:07:21,984
[SPEAKER_06]: They're gonna be special police officers on the street.

1659
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:28,906
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's a bank robbery, an active shooting situation, these individuals are going to respond to that.

1660
02:07:29,606 --> 02:07:34,728
[SPEAKER_06]: These individuals will be putting their lives on the line in a situation like that, yes.

1661
02:07:36,023 --> 02:07:44,245
[SPEAKER_06]: If something tragic were to happen, um, I would think that the city would, would do the right thing and, and, and, and make the person whole.

1662
02:07:47,806 --> 02:07:50,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1663
02:07:51,027 --> 02:07:53,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, thank you, Mr. McGill.

1664
02:07:53,307 --> 02:07:58,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, as far as, um, I can't make an amendment as a president about a trip.

1665
02:07:58,448 --> 02:08:02,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone else does, uh, or actually, you know, Mr. President, I think the chief of staff had his hand up.

1666
02:08:03,329 --> 02:08:03,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1667
02:08:03,950 --> 02:08:05,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Dave Rodriguez.

1668
02:08:07,744 --> 02:08:11,570
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President, thank you to the rest of the council and thank you to Mr. McGilvery.

1669
02:08:12,091 --> 02:08:22,466
[SPEAKER_18]: We have had some good conversations about this internally, we are vetting the issues, vetting the language of the home rule and the policy, as well as talking about some of those other operational legal issues that

1670
02:08:22,867 --> 02:08:26,249
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's important for us to understand what Harry brought up earlier about what are the implications of this.

1671
02:08:26,269 --> 02:08:29,271
[SPEAKER_18]: We're just trying to fully understand it before we advance it forward.

1672
02:08:29,911 --> 02:08:38,496
[SPEAKER_18]: So we, like I said, had some good conversations internally about it with the mayor and the chief, looking forward to speaking a little bit more with Harry on this.

1673
02:08:39,557 --> 02:08:46,020
[SPEAKER_18]: And hopefully we can get something forward as soon as possible, assuming that our vetting works out the right way.

1674
02:08:51,099 --> 02:08:51,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Chief of Staff.

1675
02:08:51,880 --> 02:08:53,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Rodriguez, Councilor Peters?

1676
02:08:54,863 --> 02:09:03,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the suggestion would be to have a committee of the whole with Chief Buckley, Mr. McGilvery, and the administration once they have their, have vetted the documentation.

1677
02:09:03,771 --> 02:09:11,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that an amendment to the main paper?

1678
02:09:12,219 --> 02:09:12,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1679
02:09:13,501 --> 02:09:14,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I jump in there?

1680
02:09:15,899 --> 02:09:16,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

1681
02:09:17,139 --> 02:09:21,820
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like I said, I'm watching this on TV and I'm doing this through my phone, so I don't know how it's coming across.

1682
02:09:21,860 --> 02:09:31,422
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, I've been requesting a meeting for, uh, as a, as a representative, the patrol, uh, men's union with the city council, uh, since June.

1683
02:09:32,442 --> 02:09:33,462
[SPEAKER_06]: And I haven't heard back.

1684
02:09:34,222 --> 02:09:41,683
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of issues that I'd like to, uh, I'd like to discuss with the council and Diana for the opportunity.

1685
02:09:41,703 --> 02:09:45,364
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, and I, and I would, I'm waiting for the day that I can come to the real.

1686
02:09:46,228 --> 02:09:52,691
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, and we both discuss, uh, and discuss these things.

1687
02:09:54,052 --> 02:10:01,655
[SPEAKER_10]: And I, uh, Mr. Montgomery, um, I think we're all, we'd all like to be back at City Hall and, you know, have people coming to the rail.

1688
02:10:01,695 --> 02:10:02,736
[SPEAKER_10]: So we all agree on that.

1689
02:10:03,116 --> 02:10:07,438
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so when we had talked previously, you had mentioned that you wanted a meeting with the public safety committee.

1690
02:10:08,018 --> 02:10:10,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to come into the hall?

1691
02:10:12,216 --> 02:10:27,905
[SPEAKER_06]: With all due respect, Mr. President, I told you I wanted to address the council, and you directed me to the public safety committee, and I think I touched base with you at least two or three more times before I felt that there was no interest.

1692
02:10:29,786 --> 02:10:35,350
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, if I may, please don't say there's no interest because there's a lot of interest.

1693
02:10:35,930 --> 02:10:36,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1694
02:10:36,310 --> 02:10:46,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, respectfully, respectfully, Mr. President, you said public safety subcommittee.

1695
02:10:47,114 --> 02:10:47,874
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the direction.

1696
02:10:47,954 --> 02:10:51,695
[SPEAKER_10]: I, I, I pointed you to that's correct.

1697
02:10:51,715 --> 02:10:53,896
[SPEAKER_10]: You pointed to that.

1698
02:10:53,996 --> 02:10:54,476
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

1699
02:10:54,516 --> 02:10:55,077
[SPEAKER_10]: We can do that.

1700
02:10:56,817 --> 02:11:02,079
[SPEAKER_06]: For the record though, Mr. President, I've been requesting a meeting with the, with the, with the council since June.

1701
02:11:03,362 --> 02:11:07,185
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have the text messages between me and you to back that up.

1702
02:11:08,005 --> 02:11:08,646
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have them too.

1703
02:11:08,686 --> 02:11:10,527
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe it was public safety subcommittee.

1704
02:11:10,547 --> 02:11:10,807
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

1705
02:11:11,147 --> 02:11:12,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's, that was, those were your words.

1706
02:11:15,490 --> 02:11:16,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Those were your words.

1707
02:11:16,691 --> 02:11:18,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, move approval on the paper as amended.

1708
02:11:20,033 --> 02:11:20,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1709
02:11:21,675 --> 02:11:22,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1710
02:11:22,095 --> 02:11:25,657
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a, let's see on the motion of a vice-president Caviello.

1711
02:11:27,398 --> 02:11:30,020
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was seconded by actually, who's that?

1712
02:11:30,180 --> 02:11:31,121
[SPEAKER_10]: That was seconded by a clerk.

1713
02:11:31,141 --> 02:11:32,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you have a second on that?

1714
02:11:37,180 --> 02:11:43,644
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Behrs has moved to have a committee of the whole, with the chief and Mr. McGill for the administration.

1715
02:11:44,044 --> 02:11:47,686
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight has an amendment, that the council be provided with a draft amendment.

1716
02:11:48,827 --> 02:11:52,229
[SPEAKER_19]: The original motion is from Vice President Carviello.

1717
02:11:52,749 --> 02:11:55,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so I'm in motion of Vice President Carviello, seconded by?

1718
02:11:56,727 --> 02:12:01,732
[SPEAKER_19]: So is the motion to approve the paper, is the motion to have the committee of the whole?

1719
02:12:02,493 --> 02:12:04,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it a motion with two amendments?

1720
02:12:04,095 --> 02:12:05,416
[SPEAKER_10]: The amendment was a committee of the whole.

1721
02:12:05,917 --> 02:12:06,237
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1722
02:12:07,899 --> 02:12:09,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll happily second as well.

1723
02:12:10,141 --> 02:12:10,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1724
02:12:10,341 --> 02:12:16,928
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Beers, as amended by Councilor Knight and by Councilor Beers.

1725
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:21,262
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, and I have Councilor Scarpelli.

1726
02:12:21,322 --> 02:12:25,366
[SPEAKER_19]: He is called into my cell phone and he's on speaker because he's having trouble with his connection.

1727
02:12:25,406 --> 02:12:27,007
[SPEAKER_19]: So he's on my speaker phone.

1728
02:12:27,328 --> 02:12:30,250
[SPEAKER_19]: So when I call the roll, I'll announce his vote if you can't hear it.

1729
02:12:33,233 --> 02:12:34,333
[SPEAKER_19]: Clerk, please call the roll.

1746
02:13:07,849 --> 02:13:08,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caviello.

1747
02:13:08,990 --> 02:13:09,170
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1748
02:13:10,642 --> 02:13:11,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1749
02:13:12,323 --> 02:13:13,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I say that?

1750
02:13:13,683 --> 02:13:15,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll put it on for you next time.

1751
02:13:15,464 --> 02:13:16,164
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1752
02:13:16,184 --> 02:13:29,690
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, I'm sure everyone has heard the news of the gift from Mr. Bloomberg and his family, the foundation of the $3 million that was accepted last week.

1753
02:13:30,770 --> 02:13:32,911
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm happy to say that.

1754
02:13:33,471 --> 02:13:37,113
[SPEAKER_28]: And to date, the foundation has raised

1755
02:13:38,749 --> 02:14:02,972
[SPEAKER_28]: almost uh 4.6 million dollars uh which in our goal was to raise uh five or more so we're we're almost at our goal of the goal of the foundation of five million at this at this moment and um and there's a there's a new push going on to do uh for some more naming rights and uh and uh for the papers and uh you'll you'll you'll start seeing some uh on

1756
02:14:03,405 --> 02:14:07,986
[SPEAKER_28]: things on the community for different kinds of community participation.

1757
02:14:08,386 --> 02:14:12,447
[SPEAKER_28]: So I just wanted to make sure everybody was aware of where we are at this particular point.

1758
02:14:13,027 --> 02:14:15,327
[SPEAKER_28]: And we're moving forward.

1759
02:14:16,188 --> 02:14:18,968
[SPEAKER_28]: And like I said, I'm very happy with the progress that it's made.

1760
02:14:19,388 --> 02:14:24,389
[SPEAKER_28]: And hopefully this library will come in somewhat to the city, maybe around $11 million.

1761
02:14:24,669 --> 02:14:32,951
[SPEAKER_28]: And so for a building of that magnitude for $11 million or $12 million, I think we've gotten quite a bargain.

1762
02:14:35,481 --> 02:14:37,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

1763
02:14:37,182 --> 02:14:38,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Any questions, comments from the council?

1764
02:14:41,105 --> 02:14:42,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Newton.

1765
02:14:42,706 --> 02:14:50,270
[SPEAKER_15]: I do think it's important to point out, Mr. President, there's a lot of talk about the library and about whether or not we needed a library and whether or not we needed a library that was this much money.

1766
02:14:51,851 --> 02:15:02,638
[SPEAKER_15]: If we were going to refurbish the existing library that we had, it would probably cost us more money than we're spending on what we have to raise and what we have to appropriate through taxation.

1767
02:15:03,298 --> 02:15:03,979
[SPEAKER_15]: With the grant,

1768
02:15:05,422 --> 02:15:09,025
[SPEAKER_15]: and the money that we have to appropriate, we're getting a library that's going to be state of the art.

1769
02:15:09,045 --> 02:15:20,354
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm so excited about this and I'm very happy to see that Mr. Bloomberg was able and willing to step forward and donate some of his hard-earned money back to his hometown for our library.

1770
02:15:20,555 --> 02:15:28,241
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's also important that, you know, we recognize the work that Councilor Caviello and his colleagues on the library fundraising committee have done.

1771
02:15:28,877 --> 02:15:30,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, this has been something that didn't happen overnight.

1772
02:15:31,158 --> 02:15:34,498
[SPEAKER_15]: It's something that happened, you know, over years and years and years of hard work.

1773
02:15:35,218 --> 02:15:42,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, you know, the City Council, uh, fought to be sure that our library was funded at an appropriate level that would make us eligible for this grant.

1774
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:52,242
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, Councilor Caviello has shown great leadership on this issue and this is going to be a long-lasting legacy, uh, for him and his family long after he's gone when they get to look at that building and see it up there and know that he had such, uh,

1775
02:15:52,842 --> 02:15:54,383
[SPEAKER_15]: such an instrumental role in making it happen.

1776
02:15:54,403 --> 02:15:59,666
[SPEAKER_15]: So Rick, thank you for everything you've done and thank you to your team because it's a really exciting time.

1777
02:15:59,806 --> 02:16:01,446
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not for me, it's for the whole city.

1778
02:16:02,127 --> 02:16:05,288
[SPEAKER_28]: It's something that the whole city will have for decades to come.

1779
02:16:05,588 --> 02:16:19,035
[SPEAKER_15]: We're in the corner, you know, we're coming close to the finish line and there's been a lot of questions about the financial uncertainty in the library and this announcement really sets me at ease and it makes me hopeful that we'll be able to raise, if not

1780
02:16:20,082 --> 02:16:24,665
[SPEAKER_15]: enough to fund the rest of it, but even more for maybe a preventative maintenance account.

1781
02:16:24,685 --> 02:16:30,810
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, with Ryu, Mr. President, the Vice President and his team over at the library, thank you very much.

1782
02:16:32,551 --> 02:16:33,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1783
02:16:34,352 --> 02:16:35,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Pierce.

1784
02:16:36,073 --> 02:16:36,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1785
02:16:37,394 --> 02:16:41,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to echo what Councilor Knight said and thank Vice President Carabiello.

1786
02:16:43,196 --> 02:17:05,178
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm personally going to be purchasing one of the the pavers And I really encourage people to check out the foundation website as as president vice president carabiello mentioned There's a lot of great opportunities And I even know that the committee's making some affordable naming opportunities and like the 50 for certain things Which I think is a really really great way for folks Um to get to get get a piece of get their name on it be a piece of this.

1787
02:17:05,318 --> 02:17:06,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Um It's such a huge process

1788
02:17:07,775 --> 02:17:10,479
[SPEAKER_05]: success and such a huge project for our community.

1789
02:17:11,020 --> 02:17:18,012
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Mr. Vice President, and really encourage people to check out the foundation website for how you can help contribute.

1790
02:17:18,974 --> 02:17:19,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Council of Bears.

1791
02:17:19,916 --> 02:17:20,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Council night.

1792
02:17:21,125 --> 02:17:33,699
[SPEAKER_15]: I also think it's important, Mr. President, I did forget to reference the hard work that our state delegation has put into also being sure that we're getting this grant and making sure that the grant remains funded and stays online.

1793
02:17:33,719 --> 02:17:39,585
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, Representative Donato continues to deliver week in and week out for the city of Medford and Representative Bob has done the same.

1794
02:17:40,278 --> 02:17:41,780
[SPEAKER_15]: especially when it comes to this library.

1795
02:17:41,841 --> 02:17:52,415
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think we're very fortunate to have them as well, Representative Gobley and all the work that they've done in maintaining a commitment to ensure that we maintain the funding level that this grant

1796
02:17:53,063 --> 02:17:58,226
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, the grand commitment was at the beginning before the COVID-19 and the fiscal crisis that struck us.

1797
02:17:58,266 --> 02:18:02,869
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's also important that we look at the work that our state delegation does.

1798
02:18:03,249 --> 02:18:04,670
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a term, it takes a village.

1799
02:18:04,951 --> 02:18:12,015
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, this is the perfect example of the city and the state government working together to deliver for the taxpayers here in the communities.

1800
02:18:15,916 --> 02:18:24,347
[SPEAKER_15]: representative Bob and representative gobbledy, as well as Senator Jalen, and making sure that the funding mechanisms remain in place so that we can continue to thrive and move forward in the project.

1801
02:18:26,429 --> 02:18:27,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, Councilor Knight.

1802
02:18:28,231 --> 02:18:29,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, any other questions from the council?

1803
02:18:30,955 --> 02:18:31,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Comments?

1804
02:18:31,676 --> 02:18:33,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other from the public, Mr. President?

1805
02:18:34,039 --> 02:18:34,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks?

1806
02:18:35,416 --> 02:18:38,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I too would like to thank Council Vice President Caviello.

1807
02:18:39,357 --> 02:18:46,278
[SPEAKER_11]: As I stated in the past, he was the first person actually to bring up the fact that there was funding available through the state.

1808
02:18:46,919 --> 02:18:48,839
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was back so many years ago.

1809
02:18:49,379 --> 02:18:51,780
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think some people looked at him like he had three heads.

1810
02:18:52,360 --> 02:18:57,001
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we're seeing that his one head worked very well for the community.

1811
02:18:57,501 --> 02:18:58,562
[SPEAKER_11]: And we appreciate that.

1812
02:18:59,703 --> 02:19:03,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I appreciate the Bloomberg donation.

1813
02:19:04,287 --> 02:19:16,677
[SPEAKER_11]: However, we can't lose sight that the original intent of this was to privately raise the full amount of the funds that we got from the state, which was about $11 million.

1814
02:19:16,977 --> 02:19:20,560
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have fallen short of that mark.

1815
02:19:21,020 --> 02:19:33,705
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is great that we got some money, but we're still looking for about $6 or $7 million in private funds so the taxpayers won't have to bear the burden because that was the original intent, Mr. President.

1816
02:19:33,745 --> 02:19:40,308
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, let's get out there and let's find some other rich donors in this community and move forward.

1817
02:19:40,788 --> 02:19:44,349
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, Mr. President, the fundraising is still continuing.

1818
02:19:44,389 --> 02:19:48,631
[SPEAKER_28]: It hasn't stopped and it will continue as long as necessary.

1819
02:19:49,411 --> 02:20:10,825
[SPEAKER_28]: And also, but I forgot to note that um, the bluebirds are donating several hundred thousand dollars with the bar To go inside the building also They're all because all of anything that has anything they like art and then say you're gonna see several hundred thousand dollars with the bar in the building and

1820
02:20:11,802 --> 02:20:14,763
[SPEAKER_28]: to make it look even nicer than anyone's anticipating.

1821
02:20:15,143 --> 02:20:16,843
[SPEAKER_28]: So again, the fundraising will continue.

1822
02:20:17,203 --> 02:20:18,824
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not stopping.

1823
02:20:18,884 --> 02:20:25,885
[SPEAKER_28]: And one of the biggest things where everyone is doing right now is the buying the pavers, which are two feet by two feet.

1824
02:20:26,646 --> 02:20:30,006
[SPEAKER_28]: And you can put up to 90 letters on the two feet by two feet.

1825
02:20:30,407 --> 02:20:33,327
[SPEAKER_28]: So again, go to the website and there's many opportunities.

1826
02:20:34,187 --> 02:20:37,728
[SPEAKER_28]: And again, we're doing our hardest to raise as much money as possible.

1827
02:20:39,509 --> 02:20:40,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Vice President Carriello.

1828
02:20:41,783 --> 02:20:42,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for all your hard work.

1829
02:20:44,524 --> 02:20:46,806
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, clerk- Motion to, oh, sorry.

1830
02:20:47,286 --> 02:20:51,608
[SPEAKER_10]: No, on the motion of Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Beers.

1831
02:20:51,648 --> 02:20:52,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks?

1839
02:21:03,034 --> 02:21:03,334
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Morrell?

1841
02:21:04,874 --> 02:21:05,135
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1842
02:21:05,655 --> 02:21:06,455
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1843
02:21:07,836 --> 02:21:08,136
Yes.

1844
02:21:08,836 --> 02:21:09,537
[SPEAKER_19]: President Falco?

1845
02:21:10,018 --> 02:21:12,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1846
02:21:12,739 --> 02:21:25,623
[SPEAKER_10]: 20-512 be it offered by Vice President Carviello, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request the city administration have the DPW immediately repair the two sidewalk panels at St.

1847
02:21:25,683 --> 02:21:28,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Rayfield's Church in the interest of public safety.

1848
02:21:29,584 --> 02:21:31,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Carviello, Vice President Carviello.

1849
02:21:31,932 --> 02:21:32,692
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1850
02:21:32,712 --> 02:21:42,477
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, this is something I put on the agenda last year when I saw a woman fall and split her head open and coming out of church at St.

1851
02:21:42,517 --> 02:21:43,337
[SPEAKER_28]: Raphael's.

1852
02:21:43,817 --> 02:21:45,898
[SPEAKER_28]: Last Saturday was that church at St.

1853
02:21:45,938 --> 02:21:47,919
[SPEAKER_28]: Raphael's coming out.

1854
02:21:48,460 --> 02:21:53,542
[SPEAKER_28]: There's two panels right by the tree and I saw another gentleman fall again.

1855
02:21:54,660 --> 02:22:04,969
[SPEAKER_28]: And again, many seniors go to that church, and when they come out, they're tripping over the sidewalk that's been lifted two to three inches, and there's two of them there.

1856
02:22:05,009 --> 02:22:13,115
[SPEAKER_28]: So if the DPW can get down there, and again, I know we've got many sidewalks filled, but again, that's a heavily traveled sidewalk.

1857
02:22:13,175 --> 02:22:21,722
[SPEAKER_28]: And again, somebody almost fell again this week, and I would hope that we can get this done in the interest of public safety as soon as possible.

1858
02:22:23,017 --> 02:22:24,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Vice President Carriello.

1859
02:22:25,379 --> 02:22:26,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Any comments for the council?

1860
02:22:28,822 --> 02:22:29,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Any from the public?

1861
02:22:30,043 --> 02:22:30,583
[SPEAKER_21]: Move approval.

1862
02:22:31,624 --> 02:22:32,885
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of council.

1863
02:22:33,306 --> 02:22:33,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

1864
02:22:33,566 --> 02:22:35,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Behrs, call the roll.

1865
02:22:38,270 --> 02:22:38,830
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Behrs.

1866
02:22:39,551 --> 02:22:39,811
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1867
02:22:40,251 --> 02:22:41,192
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Carriello.

1868
02:22:41,472 --> 02:22:41,713
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1869
02:22:42,153 --> 02:22:42,633
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight.

1870
02:22:43,014 --> 02:22:43,254
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1871
02:22:43,654 --> 02:22:44,215
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks.

1872
02:22:44,675 --> 02:22:44,955
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1873
02:22:45,476 --> 02:22:46,076
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Morrell.

1874
02:22:46,557 --> 02:22:46,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1875
02:22:47,297 --> 02:22:47,978
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1876
02:22:47,998 --> 02:22:48,078
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1877
02:22:49,426 --> 02:22:50,246
[SPEAKER_19]: President Falco.

1878
02:22:50,547 --> 02:22:52,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

1879
02:22:52,868 --> 02:22:55,670
[SPEAKER_10]: 20-513 offered by Councilor Morrell.

1880
02:22:56,150 --> 02:23:00,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas the Memphis City Council voted to declare systemic racism a public health emergency.

1881
02:23:00,373 --> 02:23:04,455
[SPEAKER_10]: And whereas the Mayor of Memphis declared systemic racism a public health crisis.

1882
02:23:05,055 --> 02:23:18,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council hold a hearing and invite the Director of Diversity, Director of Public Health, and community stakeholders to identify policies and processes for consideration by the City Council in order to address and dismantle

1883
02:23:19,384 --> 02:23:20,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilmember Morrell.

1884
02:23:20,685 --> 02:23:22,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilmember Morrell.

1885
02:23:47,360 --> 02:23:54,125
[SPEAKER_07]: is to send this to subcommittee so that a deeper discussion can be had with experts in our administration, community members and council members.

1886
02:23:55,093 --> 02:24:01,677
[SPEAKER_07]: As these issues relate to our community, our history, and our city culture, my motion is to send it to the subcommittee on cultural arts and history.

1887
02:24:02,358 --> 02:24:08,622
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't exactly have probably the most fitting subcommittee that exists for this, and that's a conversation for a different time.

1888
02:24:09,622 --> 02:24:21,390
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do understand there's a number of items that are being kind of stacking up for committee of the whole, and this is a subcommittee that we could send to and ideally hold on hearing with all due urgency.

1889
02:24:21,837 --> 02:24:25,940
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that way we can report findings back up to the entire city council.

1890
02:24:26,020 --> 02:24:30,262
[SPEAKER_07]: So my motion is to send to the cultural arts subcommittee and I move approval.

1891
02:24:31,063 --> 02:24:31,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1892
02:24:32,144 --> 02:24:35,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morrell, on the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Beers.

1893
02:24:37,187 --> 02:24:38,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, who's on that committee?

1894
02:24:39,568 --> 02:24:40,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Cabello.

1895
02:24:40,909 --> 02:24:42,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, who was on that committee?

1896
02:24:42,971 --> 02:24:46,072
[SPEAKER_10]: That committee is made up of Chair Nicole Morrell.

1897
02:24:46,993 --> 02:24:49,815
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Councilors Marks and Councilor Beers.

1898
02:24:51,688 --> 02:24:52,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1899
02:24:52,874 --> 02:24:53,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1900
02:24:56,463 --> 02:25:00,285
[SPEAKER_10]: and I think, if I may, Councilor Morrell, hearing, you said hold a hearing.

1901
02:25:00,305 --> 02:25:02,746
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's statutory.

1902
02:25:02,906 --> 02:25:06,387
[SPEAKER_10]: So it'd be like just a public meeting, but just to clarify.

1903
02:25:06,427 --> 02:25:11,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, hold a public meeting, yep, where we can hear from our experts as well as community members.

1904
02:25:11,589 --> 02:25:17,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely, but you actually make some good points about trying to find a subcommittee for it to go into.

1905
02:25:17,392 --> 02:25:19,352
[SPEAKER_10]: That's probably something that should be looked at.

1906
02:25:19,432 --> 02:25:21,653
[SPEAKER_10]: So I agree with you wholeheartedly.

1907
02:25:22,133 --> 02:25:22,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1908
02:25:22,774 --> 02:25:23,914
[SPEAKER_10]: But thank you for bringing this forward.

1909
02:25:23,934 --> 02:25:25,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any questions or comments from the council?

1910
02:25:27,511 --> 02:25:28,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President?

1911
02:25:28,532 --> 02:25:29,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Councilor Marks.

1912
02:25:30,133 --> 02:25:31,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1913
02:25:31,173 --> 02:25:34,436
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate my colleague, Councilor Morrell, for bringing this up.

1914
02:25:35,296 --> 02:25:43,802
[SPEAKER_11]: I happen to have attended the June 17th co-sponsored meeting between the City of Meffitt and the Meffitt Human Rights Commission.

1915
02:25:44,602 --> 02:25:46,924
[SPEAKER_11]: And the conversation was around racism.

1916
02:25:47,744 --> 02:25:52,048
[SPEAKER_11]: and ways that we can work together as a community to stamp out racism.

1917
02:25:52,708 --> 02:25:59,514
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we broke into a number of working groups and I believe there were a number of recommendations made.

1918
02:25:59,834 --> 02:26:03,357
[SPEAKER_11]: There were over 250 residents that attended the Zoom call.

1919
02:26:03,977 --> 02:26:11,621
[SPEAKER_11]: uh for participation and like I said we broke into different breakout groups and I think that was one way of getting some community input.

1920
02:26:12,341 --> 02:26:16,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes indeed we do have to get community input on a much wider scale.

1921
02:26:17,183 --> 02:26:25,967
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just ask that we don't recreate the wheel and that whatever we do that we move in unison as a community so we don't have all these different groups

1922
02:26:26,527 --> 02:26:30,329
[SPEAKER_11]: often their own, Mr. President, and never really amount to anything.

1923
02:26:30,410 --> 02:26:43,918
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know July 8th, the Human Rights Commission invited public participation once again at their regularly scheduled meeting to discuss next steps for addressing racism as a public health crisis.

1924
02:26:44,418 --> 02:26:54,262
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think getting these organizations all together, Mr. President, if we do have a subcommittee meeting, I think that's a great idea.

1925
02:26:54,642 --> 02:27:08,867
[SPEAKER_11]: But I would also ask that the Human Rights Commission and any other board of commission that may be able to assist, we can have Neil Osborne, the Director of Human Diversity, attend as well, Mr. President.

1926
02:27:09,387 --> 02:27:13,870
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this is going to take the old saying, it's going to take a village, Mr. President.

1927
02:27:14,331 --> 02:27:21,356
[SPEAKER_11]: And indeed, we have to get a wide range of community members and involvement to move forward on the next steps.

1928
02:27:22,837 --> 02:27:23,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1929
02:27:23,697 --> 02:27:25,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morrell, I believe you had your hand raised.

1930
02:27:25,719 --> 02:27:26,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1931
02:27:26,499 --> 02:27:29,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I think Councilor Marks' point and I very much take that to heart.

1932
02:27:29,721 --> 02:27:30,342
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that is

1933
02:27:30,837 --> 02:27:33,778
[SPEAKER_07]: and one of the intentions here where we can hear from the administration.

1934
02:27:33,938 --> 02:27:37,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Chief of Staff Rodriguez reached out to us about a grant opportunity they're pursuing.

1935
02:27:37,859 --> 02:27:44,601
[SPEAKER_07]: So understanding things like grants that are out there, we have a lot of experts in the community that have reached out and offered to have conversations.

1936
02:27:44,641 --> 02:27:46,821
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know they're at previous calls as well.

1937
02:27:46,841 --> 02:27:56,784
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think, I appreciate that and inviting as many people to the table as possible so that we can really work together on this and then bring stuff back to the city council that we can vote on and move forward on.

1938
02:27:57,164 --> 02:27:57,644
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

1939
02:27:58,204 --> 02:27:59,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1940
02:27:59,825 --> 02:28:00,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Pierce.

1941
02:28:01,738 --> 02:28:02,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1942
02:28:02,779 --> 02:28:05,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely appreciate what Councilor Mark said.

1943
02:28:05,341 --> 02:28:15,748
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this motion by Councilor Morrell really has that focus on what we as a city council can do, what we, you know, what ordinances or policies or procedures that we have authority over.

1944
02:28:16,168 --> 02:28:20,611
[SPEAKER_05]: But I agree, you know, we're a piece of a puzzle and the other commissions and the mayor's office.

1945
02:28:20,672 --> 02:28:27,416
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's important for us to figure out what we can do as well as having that coordination and those larger conversations.

1946
02:28:27,636 --> 02:28:28,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1947
02:28:30,357 --> 02:28:33,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

1948
02:28:35,419 --> 02:28:39,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, seeing and hearing none, any comments or questions from the public?

1949
02:28:45,262 --> 02:28:45,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1950
02:28:50,323 --> 02:28:50,523
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1951
02:28:50,923 --> 02:28:56,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Beers.

1952
02:28:57,826 --> 02:28:58,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk, please call the roll.

1953
02:29:00,035 --> 02:29:00,676
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Behrs?

1954
02:29:04,099 --> 02:29:04,319
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1955
02:29:05,320 --> 02:29:06,321
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Caravaglia?

1956
02:29:06,641 --> 02:29:06,881
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1957
02:29:07,362 --> 02:29:07,882
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight?

1958
02:29:09,103 --> 02:29:09,403
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1959
02:29:10,004 --> 02:29:10,585
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks?

1960
02:29:11,525 --> 02:29:11,846
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1961
02:29:12,646 --> 02:29:13,287
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Morrell?

1962
02:29:13,908 --> 02:29:14,108
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1963
02:29:15,409 --> 02:29:16,250
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1964
02:29:17,050 --> 02:29:17,351
Yes.

1965
02:29:17,871 --> 02:29:18,712
[SPEAKER_19]: President Falco?

1966
02:29:19,152 --> 02:29:21,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

1967
02:29:22,885 --> 02:29:31,647
[SPEAKER_10]: 20-515 offered by Councilor Morrell, be it resolved that the possibility of a percent for art program for the city of Medford be discussed.

1968
02:29:32,007 --> 02:29:32,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morrell.

1969
02:29:33,448 --> 02:29:34,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1970
02:29:34,508 --> 02:29:38,629
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've had a number of members from Medford's art community reach out about this.

1971
02:29:38,869 --> 02:29:41,950
[SPEAKER_07]: So the idea behind these percent for arts programs

1972
02:29:42,391 --> 02:29:55,193
[SPEAKER_07]: which are usually put in place via ordinance is for community benefit and enrichment by having a decided upon percent of construction costs or fees of municipal capital investment to be designated for use for public artwork.

1973
02:29:55,793 --> 02:30:05,235
[SPEAKER_07]: So simple, they allocate a small portion of capital construction renovation budgets or something of the like for purchase, commissioning and installation of artworks that would be in the public space.

1974
02:30:06,155 --> 02:30:08,956
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the first time to my understanding that this has come up before the council.

1975
02:30:09,016 --> 02:30:09,476
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think,

1976
02:30:11,128 --> 02:30:19,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it would be another item that would be to send to the cultural arts and history subcommittee where we could talk more deeply with representatives from our arts council and other groups.

1977
02:30:19,134 --> 02:30:20,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the arts council meets on Tuesday.

1978
02:30:20,776 --> 02:30:24,238
[SPEAKER_07]: So some of the members that brought this up to me are unable to attend.

1979
02:30:24,318 --> 02:30:36,608
[SPEAKER_07]: So sending this to subcommittee so that we can discuss how a program like this could potentially work in Medford, obviously something that council would have to vote on, but just to again, study it deeper and report it back up to the full council.

1980
02:30:37,967 --> 02:30:38,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1981
02:30:38,988 --> 02:30:42,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Any questions or comments from the Council?

1982
02:30:42,431 --> 02:30:47,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Morrell, any questions or comments from the public?

1983
02:30:47,836 --> 02:30:55,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by?

1984
02:30:55,202 --> 02:30:56,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Second, Mr. President.

1985
02:30:57,284 --> 02:30:59,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Cardinal, will the clerk please call the roll?

1986
02:30:59,707 --> 02:31:03,430
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is to move it to subcommittee on cultural arts and history.

1987
02:31:12,020 --> 02:31:13,841
[SPEAKER_19]: And Vice President Caravaglia has a second, is that correct?

1988
02:31:14,201 --> 02:31:14,581
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1989
02:31:17,603 --> 02:31:18,183
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Behrs.

1990
02:31:18,903 --> 02:31:19,164
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1991
02:31:19,684 --> 02:31:20,624
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Caravaglia.

1992
02:31:21,285 --> 02:31:21,505
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1993
02:31:22,005 --> 02:31:22,485
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight.

1994
02:31:25,307 --> 02:31:25,567
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1995
02:31:26,027 --> 02:31:26,367
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1996
02:31:27,168 --> 02:31:27,788
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks.

1997
02:31:28,148 --> 02:31:28,408
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1998
02:31:29,389 --> 02:31:29,929
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Morrell.

1999
02:31:29,949 --> 02:31:30,049
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2000
02:31:31,970 --> 02:31:32,790
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2001
02:31:33,691 --> 02:31:33,991
Yes.

2002
02:31:34,711 --> 02:31:35,452
[SPEAKER_19]: President Falco.

2003
02:31:36,250 --> 02:31:39,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, seven affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

2004
02:31:39,071 --> 02:31:44,314
[SPEAKER_10]: 2-0-5-2-0, offered by Council of Mayors, whereas the U.S.

2005
02:31:44,354 --> 02:31:46,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Census Bureau is required by the U.S.

2006
02:31:46,995 --> 02:31:57,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Constitution to conduct a count of the population every 10 years, and this count provides a historic opportunity to help shape the foundation of our society and play an active role in American democracy.

2007
02:31:57,901 --> 02:32:01,983
[SPEAKER_10]: And whereas, Medford is committed to ensuring every resident is counted and

2008
02:32:02,443 --> 02:32:30,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas method includes many hard-to-count communities, which are those that face barriers to full and equitable representation in the data collection process, and that traditionally we have undercounted, and whereas the Trump administration recently decreased the time to respond to the census, it instituted a new deadline of September 30th, 2020, endangering a complete count, and whereas census data plays an important role in the allocation of federal and state funding,

2009
02:32:31,181 --> 02:32:58,431
[SPEAKER_10]: the determination of representation and redistricting in a full capacity for economic and social science research, and whereas the information collected by the census is confidential and protected by law, now therefore be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the city is committed to partnering with the US Census Bureau and Commonwealth of Massachusetts to achieve a complete and accurate count of all persons within our borders.

2010
02:32:59,091 --> 02:33:25,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it further resolved that the Memphis City Council supports the goals and ideals for the 2020 census and will disseminate 2020 census information, encourages all residents to fill out the 2020 census before September 30, 2020, encourages all residents to participate in events and initiatives that will raise the overall awareness of the 2020 census and increase participation and support partnership specialists, census takers,

2011
02:33:25,948 --> 02:33:26,549
[SPEAKER_10]: and other U.S.

2012
02:33:27,070 --> 02:33:32,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Census Bureau staff as they help our community complete and accurate counts.

2013
02:33:32,739 --> 02:33:33,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Behrs.

2014
02:33:35,102 --> 02:33:36,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2015
02:33:36,304 --> 02:33:39,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we've talked about the census here a few times now, but

2016
02:33:40,763 --> 02:33:42,264
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been some changes.

2017
02:33:42,504 --> 02:33:49,649
[SPEAKER_05]: The Trump administration has changed the rules on us, and instead of having till the end of October to count folks, we now only have till the end of September.

2018
02:33:50,349 --> 02:33:56,774
[SPEAKER_05]: We're definitely only at a partial count here in Medford, and we have a lot of, as the resolution says, communities who are more difficult to count.

2019
02:33:57,634 --> 02:34:00,056
[SPEAKER_05]: This is obviously incredibly impactful.

2020
02:34:00,456 --> 02:34:05,980
[SPEAKER_05]: As we know, we have a budget crisis that will only be made worse if we lose federal and state funding that we need.

2021
02:34:06,961 --> 02:34:08,381
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really urgent.

2022
02:34:09,422 --> 02:34:15,045
[SPEAKER_05]: clearly, you know, the administration, the city administration or the folks who really have the power to work on this.

2023
02:34:15,505 --> 02:34:27,852
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't include specifics, but I think a couple suggestions just over the next month would be one, maybe putting out a few of those lawn signs and important rotaries and other major intersections so that people really are seeing the visibility.

2024
02:34:28,512 --> 02:34:43,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Knowing that the census something that says that the deadline is moved up and I think something else that you know, it's difficult but I think is important is we are going to have those census takers going out in person and I think something like a Communicating with the team that we're working with on the census.

2025
02:34:43,476 --> 02:34:45,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I know neil osborne's really big on this but

2026
02:34:46,037 --> 02:34:50,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe a reverse 911 call so that people know that this is happening.

2027
02:34:50,120 --> 02:34:58,105
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why someone might be ringing your doorbell It's really important to get that response in Those are just a few things and I know the administration's been working on it.

2028
02:34:58,206 --> 02:35:00,187
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just um with this added

2029
02:35:00,812 --> 02:35:05,096
[SPEAKER_05]: this deadline moved up, I think we just need to add even more emphasis on it.

2030
02:35:05,176 --> 02:35:11,021
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know that there's folks from the public who wanna speak on this as well, but that's why I put the motion forward.

2031
02:35:11,061 --> 02:35:11,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2032
02:35:12,162 --> 02:35:13,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Piers.

2033
02:35:13,844 --> 02:35:15,825
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Piers, seconded by?

2034
02:35:15,846 --> 02:35:18,748
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll second it, Mr. President.

2035
02:35:18,908 --> 02:35:19,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Knight?

2036
02:35:20,189 --> 02:35:20,710
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight?

2037
02:35:21,699 --> 02:35:24,421
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate Councilor Beers bringing this resolution forward.

2038
02:35:25,661 --> 02:35:33,666
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a part of it when I read that I was a little concerned about, it was about how we're going to disseminate information relative to how this is going to work.

2039
02:35:33,726 --> 02:35:37,628
[SPEAKER_15]: And he provided us with some solutions, a robocall, some social media, stuff like that.

2040
02:35:38,188 --> 02:35:47,113
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no problem with this type of outreach, Mr. President, especially based upon the circumstances that are going on at the federal level relative to census count, post office and the like.

2041
02:35:47,414 --> 02:35:49,835
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, I support the resolution a lot.

2042
02:35:51,295 --> 02:35:52,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2043
02:35:54,156 --> 02:35:55,157
[SPEAKER_15]: I will second it for approval.

2044
02:35:56,197 --> 02:35:56,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2045
02:35:57,717 --> 02:35:59,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions from the Council?

2046
02:36:00,278 --> 02:36:00,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Comments?

2047
02:36:00,719 --> 02:36:06,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, seeing and hearing none, we have a number of people from the public that want to speak.

2048
02:36:06,321 --> 02:36:09,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, is that Laura Rotolo?

2049
02:36:10,502 --> 02:36:11,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record, please.

2050
02:36:15,160 --> 02:36:15,580
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

2051
02:36:15,640 --> 02:36:16,161
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening.

2052
02:36:16,201 --> 02:36:17,441
[SPEAKER_23]: My name is Laura Rotolo.

2053
02:36:17,602 --> 02:36:23,005
[SPEAKER_23]: I am at 14 Rita drive, uh, in Medford and I'm also part of the American civil liberties union.

2054
02:36:23,025 --> 02:36:27,908
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm wearing two hats tonight and I just want to speak, uh, in support of this resolution.

2055
02:36:27,928 --> 02:36:38,014
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, I think as we all know, because of the COVID emergency, the census bureau had originally extended the deadline to the end of October, but it recently shortened that deadline to September 30th.

2056
02:36:38,054 --> 02:36:38,755
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're really,

2057
02:36:39,515 --> 02:36:45,101
[SPEAKER_23]: in the final crunch, and it's very important to make sure that every Medford resident is counted.

2058
02:36:45,801 --> 02:36:50,626
[SPEAKER_23]: For Massachusetts, $16 billion is affected by the census every year.

2059
02:36:50,646 --> 02:36:55,270
[SPEAKER_23]: That's for schools, hospitals, roads, housing, child care, senior centers, et cetera.

2060
02:36:55,711 --> 02:37:00,075
[SPEAKER_23]: And of course, in this age of budget cuts, it's imperative that we do not lose a single penny of that.

2061
02:37:01,056 --> 02:37:04,219
[SPEAKER_23]: There are parts of Medford that are currently undercounted.

2062
02:37:05,444 --> 02:37:11,969
[SPEAKER_23]: for example, excuse me, the census tract that encompasses Magoon Square down to Wellington has to date responded at only 51.8%.

2063
02:37:12,050 --> 02:37:17,134
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's only half of people that have responded in that area.

2064
02:37:17,254 --> 02:37:23,179
[SPEAKER_23]: In other census tracts, they're in the 60s and a few in the 70s, but we do want to make sure that everybody is counted.

2065
02:37:23,479 --> 02:37:26,702
[SPEAKER_23]: So I asked for the council support for this resolution, and I would certainly

2066
02:37:27,415 --> 02:37:39,445
[SPEAKER_23]: support reverse 911 calls and lawn signs and even just having this discussion today so that anyone who's watching this tonight knows that they can and should fill out the census by going online to my2020census.gov.

2067
02:37:41,593 --> 02:37:43,113
[SPEAKER_23]: We're calling 844-330-2020.

2068
02:37:43,733 --> 02:37:47,694
[SPEAKER_23]: That phone number is available in multiple languages.

2069
02:37:48,495 --> 02:37:49,635
[SPEAKER_23]: It's confidential.

2070
02:37:49,655 --> 02:37:52,035
[SPEAKER_23]: The information cannot be used against you.

2071
02:37:52,415 --> 02:37:56,596
[SPEAKER_23]: Your citizenship and immigration status will not be asked on the census.

2072
02:37:56,937 --> 02:37:58,117
[SPEAKER_23]: And again, thank you, Mr. President.

2073
02:37:58,337 --> 02:38:01,318
[SPEAKER_23]: And I urge the council through the chair to support this resolution.

2074
02:38:01,918 --> 02:38:02,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

2075
02:38:04,738 --> 02:38:05,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone else?

2076
02:38:05,438 --> 02:38:07,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there anyone else that would like to speak on this?

2077
02:38:12,612 --> 02:38:17,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing and hearing none, on the motion of Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Knight.

2078
02:38:18,456 --> 02:38:19,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk Urdon, please call the roll.

2079
02:38:20,298 --> 02:38:20,878
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Behrs?

2080
02:38:21,579 --> 02:38:21,819
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2081
02:38:22,319 --> 02:38:23,380
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Caravaglia?

2082
02:38:23,680 --> 02:38:24,040
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2083
02:38:24,761 --> 02:38:25,281
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight?

2084
02:38:25,581 --> 02:38:25,842
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2085
02:38:26,662 --> 02:38:27,263
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks?

2086
02:38:31,306 --> 02:38:31,826
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks?

2087
02:38:34,428 --> 02:38:34,688
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2088
02:38:35,408 --> 02:38:35,789
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2089
02:38:36,769 --> 02:38:37,370
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Morrell?

2090
02:38:37,950 --> 02:38:38,170
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2091
02:38:39,331 --> 02:38:40,112
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2092
02:38:42,715 --> 02:38:43,535
[SPEAKER_19]: President Falco.

2093
02:38:44,656 --> 02:38:47,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

2094
02:39:04,244 --> 02:39:08,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Have we covered all of the, everything under, just to make sure I haven't missed anything.

2095
02:39:13,893 --> 02:39:27,341
[SPEAKER_28]: We have some public participation on there, but before we do the public participation, can we get an update from the clerk on the early voting and any issues that have arisen?

2096
02:39:28,162 --> 02:39:28,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

2097
02:39:28,883 --> 02:39:29,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I can.

2098
02:39:29,984 --> 02:39:34,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Clark Carnaby, would you mind giving us an update with early elections?

2099
02:39:34,110 --> 02:39:39,557
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that early voting, I know you've been swamped with that and you've been very busy.

2100
02:39:39,577 --> 02:39:42,841
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you could please give us an update, we'd greatly appreciate it.

2101
02:39:42,861 --> 02:39:43,742
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

2102
02:39:43,762 --> 02:39:45,204
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, let me start off.

2103
02:39:46,125 --> 02:40:00,150
[SPEAKER_19]: First, by saying, you know, we've been swamped, but we had a mistake of our own making, unfortunately, in which we did not mail out the required yellow envelope with some of the ballots that we processed on August 11th and August 12th.

2104
02:40:00,190 --> 02:40:01,671
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, we apologized for that.

2105
02:40:02,111 --> 02:40:04,252
[SPEAKER_19]: We notified the Secretary of State's office immediately.

2106
02:40:04,292 --> 02:40:05,913
[SPEAKER_19]: We sent out a reverse 911 call.

2107
02:40:06,613 --> 02:40:08,754
[SPEAKER_19]: We immediately began mailing out the proper envelopes.

2108
02:40:09,994 --> 02:40:11,215
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're trying to address that.

2109
02:40:11,375 --> 02:40:15,098
[SPEAKER_19]: We're continuing to try to address that because there are still some people who haven't gotten the envelopes.

2110
02:40:15,498 --> 02:40:22,182
[SPEAKER_19]: There are actually people who've gotten the envelopes, but on the other side, there are actually people who've gotten their envelopes but haven't gotten the ballots we mailed originally.

2111
02:40:22,222 --> 02:40:28,326
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're also working with the post office every day to make sure that there's timely delivery on the ballots themselves.

2112
02:40:29,557 --> 02:40:33,160
[SPEAKER_19]: On the other front, however, look, we made a mistake here.

2113
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:35,222
[SPEAKER_19]: I apologize for that on behalf of my team.

2114
02:40:36,323 --> 02:40:40,907
[SPEAKER_19]: On the other front, we have early voting occurring in City Hall.

2115
02:40:41,427 --> 02:40:42,608
[SPEAKER_19]: It started on Saturday.

2116
02:40:43,469 --> 02:40:46,272
[SPEAKER_19]: Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, it's been very steady.

2117
02:40:46,832 --> 02:40:52,657
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been roughly 250 people a day, a little over 250 on Saturday, around 250 on Sunday.

2118
02:40:52,717 --> 02:40:55,760
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been just over 1,000 people have early voted so far.

2119
02:40:56,281 --> 02:40:57,064
[SPEAKER_19]: It's successful.

2120
02:40:57,786 --> 02:40:59,953
[SPEAKER_19]: Strict social distancing guidelines are in place.

2121
02:41:01,462 --> 02:41:03,062
[SPEAKER_19]: throughout the chamber and throughout the building.

2122
02:41:03,923 --> 02:41:13,705
[SPEAKER_19]: And for those who don't wanna vote in person, we have the extra yellow envelopes in the clerk's office and the registrar's and voter's office at the front desk at city hall.

2123
02:41:14,305 --> 02:41:19,806
[SPEAKER_19]: We also have a secure drop box on the east exit of city hall that is marked drop ballots here.

2124
02:41:20,106 --> 02:41:23,667
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's a secure metal drop box that looks similar to a post office box.

2125
02:41:24,227 --> 02:41:29,788
[SPEAKER_19]: And finally, we have a second drop box that the DPW just created for us today.

2126
02:41:30,948 --> 02:41:36,851
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a heavy wooden box that's padlocked, and I have the key, and you can also deposit your ballots there.

2127
02:41:38,092 --> 02:41:40,634
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's at the front desk at City Hall.

2128
02:41:40,654 --> 02:41:41,794
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

2129
02:41:43,135 --> 02:41:43,795
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Clerk.

2130
02:41:43,875 --> 02:41:50,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caviello, are you all set?

2131
02:41:50,039 --> 02:41:50,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have any questions?

2132
02:41:51,199 --> 02:41:51,499
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2133
02:41:51,519 --> 02:41:57,543
[SPEAKER_28]: I just wanted to, you know, many residents had asked, so I'm glad the clerk has provided us with an update.

2134
02:41:57,583 --> 02:41:58,243
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

2135
02:41:58,994 --> 02:42:00,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, thank you very much.

2136
02:42:00,175 --> 02:42:00,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for your hard work.

2137
02:42:01,476 --> 02:42:01,977
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2138
02:42:02,037 --> 02:42:05,379
[SPEAKER_28]: And Mr. President, we do have something on the public participation.

2139
02:42:05,560 --> 02:42:07,521
[SPEAKER_10]: We do, that is up next.

2140
02:42:07,621 --> 02:42:23,655
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have public participation and public participation tonight is Kelly Gattalo, 46 Otis Street, Memphis, Massachusetts, 02155 to address the city council regarding the building zoning ordinance in historical demolition delay ordinance.

2141
02:42:25,416 --> 02:42:26,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

2142
02:42:27,962 --> 02:42:28,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Behrs.

2143
02:42:29,203 --> 02:42:30,524
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have a question for rule 38.

2144
02:42:30,884 --> 02:42:35,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not seeing the building commissioner or the chair of the historical commission here.

2145
02:42:36,027 --> 02:42:40,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering if we should postpone this until they can be available to be here for this topic.

2146
02:42:42,431 --> 02:42:42,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Rule 38.

2147
02:42:42,732 --> 02:42:44,473
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to need a minute.

2148
02:43:02,846 --> 02:43:07,469
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a matter of public participation, Mr. President, not a petition, not a resolution, not a resolve.

2149
02:43:07,509 --> 02:43:10,571
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it's going to be subject to that rule in my personal opinion as the chair.

2150
02:43:10,751 --> 02:43:11,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Public participation.

2151
02:43:11,932 --> 02:43:14,434
[SPEAKER_10]: So you are correct, Councilor Knight.

2152
02:43:14,494 --> 02:43:15,755
[SPEAKER_10]: So Ms.

2153
02:43:15,795 --> 02:43:16,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Catala does have the floor.

2154
02:43:17,436 --> 02:43:17,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2155
02:43:18,917 --> 02:43:21,038
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

2156
02:43:21,078 --> 02:43:21,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2157
02:43:22,938 --> 02:43:24,479
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, President Falco.

2158
02:43:25,340 --> 02:43:38,190
[SPEAKER_27]: So I am here tonight to talk to the council to ask you to readdress the historical demolition delay order, which the last it was amended was in 2017.

2159
02:43:40,591 --> 02:43:42,052
[SPEAKER_27]: I've emailed the whole council.

2160
02:43:42,252 --> 02:43:45,332
[SPEAKER_27]: I hope that everybody took an opportunity to read what I sent you.

2161
02:43:45,352 --> 02:43:53,935
[SPEAKER_27]: I feel like part of what's going on is only going to increase the cost of housing and it's going to cause a lot of problems in the city of Medford.

2162
02:43:54,415 --> 02:44:01,557
[SPEAKER_27]: So I would ask that you would meet and that you would discuss the demolition delay that you have and what the intent of it is.

2163
02:44:02,212 --> 02:44:09,919
[SPEAKER_27]: Because on July 16, the building department instituted some new rules which are not in the building code.

2164
02:44:10,419 --> 02:44:18,046
[SPEAKER_27]: They are not part of the historical demolition delay, which already has definitions on what the demolition would be.

2165
02:44:19,446 --> 02:44:30,509
[SPEAKER_27]: And right now, you cannot do anything without the Historical Commission's approval if you're going to removal of more than one quarter of an existing building.

2166
02:44:30,689 --> 02:44:36,810
[SPEAKER_27]: If you want to replace all the windows in your house, that is more than 25% slash one quarter of the building.

2167
02:44:37,250 --> 02:44:44,252
[SPEAKER_27]: Removal of a roof, if you want to dormer your third floor, now the Historical Society gets a say over that.

2168
02:44:45,592 --> 02:44:47,593
[SPEAKER_27]: Removal of one side of a building.

2169
02:44:47,693 --> 02:44:52,554
[SPEAKER_27]: So if you want to add a room for grandma to move in, historical gets a say on that.

2170
02:44:53,015 --> 02:44:58,336
[SPEAKER_27]: The gutting of a building's interior to the point where the exterior features, the windows, doors, walls are impacted.

2171
02:44:59,537 --> 02:45:06,979
[SPEAKER_27]: Excuse me, Councilor Falco, but this is design review, and we don't have design review in the city of Medford.

2172
02:45:07,379 --> 02:45:10,502
[SPEAKER_27]: We have a building department which has a building code.

2173
02:45:10,983 --> 02:45:12,464
[SPEAKER_27]: None of this is in the code.

2174
02:45:12,825 --> 02:45:20,293
[SPEAKER_27]: This is not fair to the property owners or the people that are looking to buy property in the city of Medford.

2175
02:45:20,673 --> 02:45:26,439
[SPEAKER_27]: If you're looking to buy a piece of property in the city and you know you're going to do work, you're going to go read the building code.

2176
02:45:26,900 --> 02:45:28,742
[SPEAKER_27]: None of this is in the building code.

2177
02:45:28,922 --> 02:45:29,783
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not fair.

2178
02:45:30,183 --> 02:45:35,408
[SPEAKER_27]: they're going to buy the property, find out after the fact that the historical committee can say no.

2179
02:45:35,569 --> 02:45:46,640
[SPEAKER_27]: And it doesn't matter whether or not they will, but should that group of people be deciding who gets to do what, or should the building department be deciding it?

2180
02:45:46,660 --> 02:45:49,623
[SPEAKER_27]: And if it is the building department, it is going to be part of the code.

2181
02:45:50,023 --> 02:45:51,424
[SPEAKER_27]: Please put it in writing.

2182
02:45:51,464 --> 02:46:12,340
[SPEAKER_27]: That's only fair before people spend their money in this city I would just ask that maybe you bring it to a committee of the whole or whatever it is that you're going to do and Discuss with the intent of the demolition delay was the definitions that are in the demolition delay are very different than what's in here you have definitions as to what a demolition is and

2183
02:46:12,760 --> 02:46:18,965
[SPEAKER_27]: The historical commission here has gone and now they're going to go use the definition of the National Park Service.

2184
02:46:19,525 --> 02:46:22,687
[SPEAKER_27]: Our building code does not reference the National Park Service.

2185
02:46:23,107 --> 02:46:26,730
[SPEAKER_27]: It is very specific into what a demolition is.

2186
02:46:27,290 --> 02:46:27,891
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, sir.

2187
02:46:28,611 --> 02:46:28,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2188
02:46:28,992 --> 02:46:31,934
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a question from the council.

2189
02:46:31,974 --> 02:46:35,596
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Councilor Morrell, Councilor Beers, Councilor Knight, Councilor Morrell.

2190
02:46:36,257 --> 02:46:37,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2191
02:46:37,337 --> 02:46:40,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe this item came before the council at the last regular meeting.

2192
02:46:41,422 --> 02:46:42,803
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was a pretty thorough discussion.

2193
02:46:42,823 --> 02:46:47,447
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty thorough even though the agenda item was vague and many people did not know what was going to be discussed.

2194
02:46:47,828 --> 02:46:51,291
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe we voted to bring this up again at a committee of the whole.

2195
02:47:00,387 --> 02:47:09,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Um and you know, the building department is the one that's putting in procedures to ensure that the ordinance is properly followed, as the building commissioner said in his response today to all of us.

2196
02:47:10,598 --> 02:47:16,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Um so again, I really wish that we had the people here to really answer this question formally.

2197
02:47:16,404 --> 02:47:19,067
[SPEAKER_05]: But just given what's happening in our city with the absolutely

2198
02:47:20,627 --> 02:47:23,488
[SPEAKER_05]: that's happening on West Street with just the complete gutting of a house.

2199
02:47:23,608 --> 02:47:30,230
[SPEAKER_05]: And quite frankly, the fact that we need these proper procedures in place to make sure that existing ordinances are being followed to the letter.

2200
02:47:30,250 --> 02:47:35,491
[SPEAKER_05]: The historical commission has no authority over permits, so it's not the historical commission.

2201
02:47:35,511 --> 02:47:37,131
[SPEAKER_05]: The building department is putting in procedures.

2202
02:47:37,151 --> 02:47:39,032
[SPEAKER_05]: The building commissioner sent an email to that effect.

2203
02:47:39,612 --> 02:47:42,052
[SPEAKER_05]: I support the committee of the whole that we've already voted on last month.

2204
02:47:42,212 --> 02:47:42,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2205
02:47:46,281 --> 02:47:49,123
[SPEAKER_15]: About 30 days have passed since we made the request, Mr. President.

2206
02:47:49,223 --> 02:48:03,194
[SPEAKER_15]: Since 2017, when the demolition delay ordinance was changed, granting an 18-month demolition delay, how many homes have been determined to be historically, culturally, or politically significant and have been restored?

2207
02:48:05,456 --> 02:48:09,059
[SPEAKER_14]: We still haven't gotten that information, so I'd like to reiterate that request, Mr. President.

2208
02:48:11,350 --> 02:48:15,591
[SPEAKER_15]: But you know what, this is a public participation paper, and I don't want to get into open meeting law violations.

2209
02:48:15,631 --> 02:48:17,052
[SPEAKER_15]: I won't offer that in the form of a motion.

2210
02:48:17,492 --> 02:48:22,153
[SPEAKER_15]: What I'll do is I'll put it on the agenda for the next meeting, provided that my council colleagues have no problem with that.

2211
02:48:22,193 --> 02:48:25,013
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an update item, it's an update issue, and we haven't received an update on it.

2212
02:48:25,033 --> 02:48:31,715
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'll revisit this, Mr. President, when appropriate, but I do feel as though this is information that we need.

2213
02:48:32,455 --> 02:48:39,437
[SPEAKER_15]: I also think it's going to be very important for us to take a look at the, they have an annual report.

2214
02:48:40,338 --> 02:48:47,003
[SPEAKER_15]: The historic commission has to file an annual report with the administration, with the mayor, pursuant to, I believe, chapter 48 of our local ordinances.

2215
02:48:47,343 --> 02:48:50,525
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd be very interested to see what those documents say.

2216
02:48:50,565 --> 02:48:55,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President may be going back to 2017 or 2016 when we made the ordinance change.

2217
02:48:55,889 --> 02:49:04,254
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd also like to see those maybe published on the internet so that we have an open and transparent process for individuals to have the opportunity to look at.

2218
02:49:04,274 --> 02:49:09,438
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that those words were very big during the campaign for mayor, and I hope that they still hold true to this day.

2219
02:49:10,278 --> 02:49:12,559
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I do rest my case.

2220
02:49:13,359 --> 02:49:15,880
[SPEAKER_15]: I share a lot of the concerns that Ms.

2221
02:49:15,920 --> 02:49:16,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Catalo has brought up.

2222
02:49:17,620 --> 02:49:25,483
[SPEAKER_15]: I share a lot of concerns about what's going on when it comes to development here in the community and when it comes to, you know, boards and commissions.

2223
02:49:27,203 --> 02:49:28,004
[SPEAKER_15]: exceeding their authority.

2224
02:49:28,704 --> 02:49:32,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so with that being said, I think this is an issue that does need further investigation.

2225
02:49:32,206 --> 02:49:33,787
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why I voted for it previously.

2226
02:49:34,448 --> 02:49:36,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, but I can certainly understand where Ms.

2227
02:49:36,389 --> 02:49:37,329
[SPEAKER_15]: Catalo is coming from.

2228
02:49:37,850 --> 02:49:49,077
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's also important to point out, um, the reliance that the city has on the issuance of building permits, new growth in the community.

2229
02:49:50,283 --> 02:49:58,072
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are two very important items that come into play when it comes to municipal finance and our ability to be sustainable and to meet our financial obligations going forward.

2230
02:49:58,532 --> 02:50:00,474
[SPEAKER_15]: So those are things that we need to think about, Mr. President.

2231
02:50:01,055 --> 02:50:05,640
[SPEAKER_15]: With that being said, I rest my case and I thank the petitioner for bringing the matter forward this evening.

2232
02:50:07,002 --> 02:50:07,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2233
02:50:09,004 --> 02:50:11,787
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have any other questions from the council?

2234
02:50:13,962 --> 02:50:16,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we still have Scott Pelley with us?

2235
02:50:17,088 --> 02:50:17,909
[SPEAKER_10]: He's on my cell phone.

2236
02:50:18,210 --> 02:50:18,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2237
02:50:19,291 --> 02:50:21,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Just please let me know if you do, if he has any questions.

2238
02:50:22,277 --> 02:50:24,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, Kelly Kitalo.

2239
02:50:25,862 --> 02:50:29,664
[SPEAKER_27]: So I would just like to answer Councilor Behrs.

2240
02:50:30,244 --> 02:50:33,705
[SPEAKER_27]: Zoning is determined by the council.

2241
02:50:33,725 --> 02:50:37,207
[SPEAKER_27]: It is not determined by the building department of the historic commission.

2242
02:50:37,767 --> 02:50:49,392
[SPEAKER_27]: These items all relate to zoning and the zoning as a contract with the property owners to be able to purchase a piece of property in this country is your constitutional right to be able to improve it.

2243
02:50:49,872 --> 02:50:53,554
[SPEAKER_27]: is your constitutional right, and it is to go by the zoning code.

2244
02:50:53,714 --> 02:51:04,860
[SPEAKER_27]: I have already called the state building department in regards to this, and none of this is in our building code, and you can't just institute this without the city council approval.

2245
02:51:05,240 --> 02:51:10,223
[SPEAKER_27]: That is why I am coming to the seven of you, and I hope that you can appreciate that I am coming to you.

2246
02:51:10,463 --> 02:51:10,903
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2247
02:51:11,323 --> 02:51:12,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Mr. President.

2248
02:51:13,084 --> 02:51:16,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still not sure what this is, but, you know,

2249
02:51:16,868 --> 02:51:19,450
[SPEAKER_05]: zoning is how we as a community determine land use.

2250
02:51:19,690 --> 02:51:21,031
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really what zoning is.

2251
02:51:21,151 --> 02:51:34,599
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be clear, I believe what the commissioner said today is new procedures were implemented by the building department to assure the contractors and homeowners are adhering to the historical commission's demolition delay ordinance guidelines and recommendations.

2252
02:51:34,719 --> 02:51:36,561
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Mr. President.

2253
02:51:37,101 --> 02:51:38,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to receive in place on file.

2254
02:51:38,482 --> 02:51:41,724
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have someone who wants to speak.

2255
02:51:41,744 --> 02:51:45,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record.

2256
02:51:46,427 --> 02:51:46,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Doug.

2257
02:51:48,921 --> 02:51:49,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Turn on the audio.

2258
02:51:50,902 --> 02:51:52,103
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I'll be very brief.

2259
02:51:52,943 --> 02:51:53,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Ms.

2260
02:51:53,363 --> 02:51:54,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Cattallo, for bringing this to our attention.

2261
02:51:55,524 --> 02:52:01,647
[SPEAKER_17]: I would invite you to come to our next historic commission meeting on the 14th of September so we could talk about it in more detail.

2262
02:52:03,468 --> 02:52:05,609
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd just like to point out a couple of things.

2263
02:52:05,749 --> 02:52:17,515
[SPEAKER_17]: One is the demo delay to prevent the teardown of historic buildings that we deem significant is very different than a demolition permit that is for a porch or a smaller thing.

2264
02:52:18,708 --> 02:52:19,849
[SPEAKER_17]: have nearly the sway there.

2265
02:52:19,889 --> 02:52:31,657
[SPEAKER_17]: We're just trying to have the city enforce its own ordinances and laws, which I don't think have been done accurately over the years.

2266
02:52:32,117 --> 02:52:37,501
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we've had a meeting with the mayor and commissioner Moki, who I respect highly.

2267
02:52:38,221 --> 02:52:43,765
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we had a good meeting to try to basically have the city follow its own rules.

2268
02:52:44,606 --> 02:52:45,766
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not looking to change anything.

2269
02:52:46,067 --> 02:52:46,847
[SPEAKER_17]: The 18 month demo delay,

2270
02:52:48,625 --> 02:52:52,367
[SPEAKER_17]: was an extremely important tool, but that's something that's rarely used.

2271
02:52:52,407 --> 02:53:02,013
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will be happy to get some facts to counsel remarks about how many of these delays that we put on products.

2272
02:53:02,073 --> 02:53:03,834
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not that many over the years.

2273
02:53:05,735 --> 02:53:07,316
[SPEAKER_17]: The commission is not anti-development.

2274
02:53:07,396 --> 02:53:08,176
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm an architect.

2275
02:53:08,877 --> 02:53:11,218
[SPEAKER_17]: I've built hundreds of apartments, many of them in Medford.

2276
02:53:12,199 --> 02:53:13,700
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not looking to stop development.

2277
02:53:13,720 --> 02:53:15,541
[SPEAKER_17]: We're looking to stop abuses.

2278
02:53:16,168 --> 02:53:17,148
[SPEAKER_17]: especially of neighborhoods.

2279
02:53:17,188 --> 02:53:23,990
[SPEAKER_17]: Neighborhoods have been abused by people bending the rules.

2280
02:53:24,390 --> 02:53:27,091
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not the role of the historical commission.

2281
02:53:27,131 --> 02:53:33,053
[SPEAKER_15]: The role of the historical commission is to determine whether or not a property has political, cultural, or historical significance in the community.

2282
02:53:33,153 --> 02:53:34,093
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what their role is.

2283
02:53:34,133 --> 02:53:36,934
[SPEAKER_15]: The building department's job is to stop abuses.

2284
02:53:37,894 --> 02:53:38,794
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, that's right.

2285
02:53:38,834 --> 02:53:40,995
[SPEAKER_14]: And we brought it to their attention and now they're doing that.

2286
02:53:41,272 --> 02:53:42,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor, I agree with you 100%.

2287
02:53:42,473 --> 02:53:50,037
[SPEAKER_14]: It's my understanding that the building department is responding to changes that the Historical Commission has made to their procedures and processes.

2288
02:53:50,557 --> 02:53:51,758
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that's not accurate at all.

2289
02:53:52,258 --> 02:53:56,941
[SPEAKER_15]: Relative to the adoption of some standard relative to the National Wildlife Service or something like that.

2290
02:53:56,961 --> 02:53:59,042
[SPEAKER_17]: That is completely inaccurate, Councilor.

2291
02:53:59,102 --> 02:54:00,983
[SPEAKER_15]: That is not actually correct at all.

2292
02:54:01,264 --> 02:54:07,247
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the conversation that we had last meeting, and that was what seemed to be affirmed by both Mr. Mulkey and the chairman of the commission.

2293
02:54:08,513 --> 02:54:10,994
[SPEAKER_15]: Which standard did you say the commission put in front of those?

2294
02:54:11,234 --> 02:54:15,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Some wildlife thing about log cabins in the woods for national parks or something like that.

2295
02:54:16,256 --> 02:54:18,857
[SPEAKER_15]: No, Councillor, you're just inaccurate.

2296
02:54:19,057 --> 02:54:21,858
[SPEAKER_15]: That's factually inaccurate.

2297
02:54:22,138 --> 02:54:25,860
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, that was what was portrayed to us anyway at the last meeting.

2298
02:54:26,460 --> 02:54:29,661
[SPEAKER_15]: But with that being said, Mr. President, this is a petition for public participation.

2299
02:54:30,442 --> 02:54:34,443
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't warrant a vote, receiving a place on file or anything else.

2300
02:54:34,523 --> 02:54:36,704
[SPEAKER_15]: The petitioners made their case, so with that being

2301
02:54:37,618 --> 02:54:41,082
[SPEAKER_15]: I certainly have nothing to add further and I look forward to a committee of the whole.

2302
02:54:42,003 --> 02:54:42,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2303
02:54:43,004 --> 02:54:44,465
[SPEAKER_10]: We will schedule a committee of the whole soon.

2304
02:54:44,485 --> 02:54:46,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Behrs.

2305
02:54:46,888 --> 02:54:47,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2306
02:54:47,508 --> 02:54:47,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be brief.

2307
02:54:47,969 --> 02:54:51,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is exactly why I was hoping that rule 38 would be ruled as applying here.

2308
02:54:51,993 --> 02:54:58,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Clearly, there's not correct information floating around and until we have it, we're just going to keep having conversations not based on the truth.

2309
02:54:58,419 --> 02:54:59,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2310
02:54:59,831 --> 02:55:00,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Piers.

2311
02:55:01,372 --> 02:55:03,873
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Piers, seconded by Councilor- Personal privilege?

2312
02:55:04,693 --> 02:55:06,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of personal privilege, Councilor Knight.

2313
02:55:06,934 --> 02:55:12,617
[SPEAKER_15]: I do hope that the gentleman is not saying that I'm lying when surrounding the term truth.

2314
02:55:14,037 --> 02:55:15,938
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted that to be very clear that I'm

2315
02:55:16,714 --> 02:55:19,776
[SPEAKER_15]: representing what I heard at the last meeting, I'm not making anything up.

2316
02:55:21,277 --> 02:55:30,643
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that when I heard the term truth, it kind of broke up there, but I wanted to be sure that I wasn't being called someone that was portraying facts that were different than what happened at the last meeting.

2317
02:55:31,384 --> 02:55:37,287
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I trust that the council wasn't attacking me personally on that or calling me a liar.

2318
02:55:37,928 --> 02:55:42,951
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it might make sense for all of us to be in the same room to discuss this issue as we voted on last meeting.

2319
02:55:43,733 --> 02:55:44,373
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would agree.

2320
02:55:44,513 --> 02:55:51,116
[SPEAKER_10]: I think at this point it's best to just get into a committee of the whole, get all the parties in there that should be there.

2321
02:55:51,136 --> 02:55:56,339
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we can discuss it and have a full conversation and make sure everyone's on the same page.

2322
02:55:56,399 --> 02:56:01,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it sounds like right now... I think there's some inaccurate information.

2323
02:56:01,061 --> 02:56:04,422
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd love to have a good meeting with President Falco.

2324
02:56:04,903 --> 02:56:07,344
[SPEAKER_17]: We will come to that meeting and engage.

2325
02:56:07,464 --> 02:56:08,404
[SPEAKER_17]: And I look forward to it.

2326
02:56:08,624 --> 02:56:10,185
[SPEAKER_17]: You've seen our letter, you know our position.

2327
02:56:10,956 --> 02:56:12,177
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not anti-development.

2328
02:56:12,277 --> 02:56:20,345
[SPEAKER_17]: We're just trying to make sure that the city protects the neighborhoods from which they need that protection from some developers who are bending the rules.

2329
02:56:20,385 --> 02:56:20,785
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all.

2330
02:56:21,065 --> 02:56:22,727
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2331
02:56:26,763 --> 02:56:28,024
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to all be on the same set of facts.

2332
02:56:28,044 --> 02:56:29,564
[SPEAKER_05]: That is why I support the committee of the whole.

2333
02:56:44,450 --> 02:56:50,613
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I believe that when the council recently changed the rules on public participation, this does not require a vote.

2334
02:56:50,933 --> 02:56:51,453
[SPEAKER_10]: You are correct.

2335
02:56:51,673 --> 02:56:52,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I withdraw my motion.

2336
02:56:52,914 --> 02:56:53,734
[SPEAKER_05]: My motion was out of order.

2337
02:56:54,994 --> 02:57:00,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Council appears to withdraw this motion.

2338
02:57:00,397 --> 02:57:01,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

2339
02:57:01,417 --> 02:57:08,260
[SPEAKER_10]: We will be scheduling a committee of the whole soon to discuss this issue, and we'll let you know when we have a date.

2340
02:57:09,340 --> 02:57:09,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2341
02:57:11,061 --> 02:57:12,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

2342
02:57:14,217 --> 02:57:14,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there reports?

2343
02:57:16,597 --> 02:57:17,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Three Committee of the Whole reports.

2344
02:57:18,678 --> 02:57:29,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so let's see, we have... Reports from Committees, 20-482, July 27th, Committee of the Whole.

2345
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:37,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, the purpose of that meeting was to discuss open meeting law complaint against Medford City Council.

2346
02:57:38,522 --> 02:57:42,123
[SPEAKER_10]: We did that, and City Solicitor Scanlon responded

2347
02:57:43,870 --> 02:57:44,610
[SPEAKER_10]: to the compliance.

2348
02:57:46,391 --> 02:57:46,952
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion.

2349
02:57:47,512 --> 02:57:48,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Move approval.

2350
02:57:48,873 --> 02:57:51,034
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion Councilor Behrs to approve, seconded by.

2351
02:57:51,054 --> 02:57:51,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

2352
02:57:51,554 --> 02:57:54,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caviello, Clerk, please call the roll.

2353
02:57:58,018 --> 02:57:58,578
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Behrs.

2354
02:57:58,998 --> 02:57:59,239
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2355
02:57:59,879 --> 02:58:00,799
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Caviello.

2356
02:58:01,100 --> 02:58:01,340
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2357
