    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1.752s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2.973s">Pursuant</a>  to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law, General Law Chapter 38, Section 18, and the Governor's March 15, 2020 order imposing strict limitation on the number of people that may gather in one place, this meeting of the Medford City Council will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=22.663s">Specific</a>  information and the general guidelines for remote participation by members of the public and or parties with a right and or requirement to attend this meeting can be found on the City of Medford website at www.medfordma.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=36.9s">For</a>  this meeting members of the public who wish to listen or watch the meeting may do so by accessing the meeting link contained herein. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=43.713s">No</a>  in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings in real time via technological means. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=53.237s">In</a>  the event that we are unable to do so, despite best efforts, we will post on the City of Medford or Medford Community Media website an audio or video recording transcript or other comprehensive record of proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=66.323s">Okay,</a>  I just wanted to, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=72.109s">just</a>  make a quick statement regarding these meetings here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=76.093s">So</a>  last week we had a Committee of the Whole meeting at City Council Chambers, and the public was able to access the meeting via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=84.238s">Tonight,</a>  the council members are back home, accessing the meeting via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=89.101s">The</a>  reason why we are doing this from home tonight is we have early voting this week in City Hall, and I know Clerk Hurtubise has been working hard at that since Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=99.487s">I</a>  know that's been taking up most of his time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=102.869s">They</a>  have the tabulation machines behind the rails and they would have to move everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=106.372s">So</a>  this should be, uh, hopefully the last time that the council has to log in from their homes and we can do it, uh, in council chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=114.417s">The</a>  council can meet in council chambers going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=117.299s">Uh,</a>  and so that is the plan, but I just wanted to explain that before we get started.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=641.633s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=642.553s">Thank</a>  you to the rest of the council as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=645.294s">The</a>  draft ordinance that's being presented by the mayor tonight would add Chapter 71 to the revised ordinances of the city and would establish road and control measures that are in place for building construction, road construction, as well as establishing and requiring plans to be put forth for mitigation from restaurants and other businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=666.918s">There's</a>  also a fee structure that's in place that would <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=669.898s">provide</a>  that would be put into a revolving account, which is also being created by the proposed measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=675.9s">The</a>  purpose of which would be to support rodent mitigation and other measures that directly work towards mitigating rodents, rats, mice throughout the community as the result of any number of issues and whether not just construction, but also we all know that rats and other vermin <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=697.088s">they</a>  thrive where there's water and there's food, and we need to try to do that in a densely populated area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=702.25s">So</a>  this is a pretty, we view this as a pretty progressive and aggressive way in order to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=709.232s">And</a>  we look forward to having a conversation with the council and the community at large to put the measure forward in order to address the multiple items that were put forth by the council and the community in recent times.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=721.956s">Chief</a>  of Staff Rodriguez, Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=726.145s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=727.126s">And</a>  thank you to my fellow Councilors for many of you for bringing this issue up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=731.71s">I</a>  just have a couple of questions, Dave. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=735.134s">In</a>  terms of the fee structure, how did you arrive at the amounts that you arrived at? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=741.319s">And</a>  is there an estimate of how much this might raise over a year?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=744.002s">We</a>  tried to do it as fairly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=749.638s">And</a>  this was a conversation that the mayor rolled up her sleeves personally and really dove in with Maryann O'Connor and a number of individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=756.022s">And</a>  we looked at what other communities were doing in terms of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=760.224s">So</a>  the fee structure is in line with what other cities and towns are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=764.526s">You</a>  will see that there is no fee that's related to restaurants and other small businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=772.202s">that</a>  was included, but in light of some of the challenging times that are being faced by restaurants and small businesses, given the economic times, that fee was removed as part of this proposal and can certainly be added in later as part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=785.764s">They</a>  will certainly have to also submit an IPM, which is with the plan, that's part of it, but there's no fee associated with those measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=794.806s">So</a>  what other cities and towns are doing, try to bring it in line with that and try to be as fair as possible.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=802.46s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=802.76s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=803.02s">And</a>  then just kind of on that general scope, um, you know, how much might this raise in a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=808.242s">What</a>  is the general cost of some of the road and abatement measures that you want to implement and that we all want to see implemented? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=814.324s">And</a>  like, would these fees provide enough revenue to accomplish the goal?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=818.946s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=819.346s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=819.686s">I</a>  don't have the exact figure as to what, if we've modeled this out yet, but I can certainly get that information for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=825.318s">And</a>  I can touch base with Marian O'Connor, who is on a very well-deserved vacation at the moment, to get the exact amount of which we've spent on road mitigation and baiting and trapping in the last couple of months, especially as we've seen an increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=839.644s">So</a>  I can get that information for you, no problem.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=841.725s">Thanks,</a>  Dave. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=842.165s">Super</a>  helpful.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=843.582s">Thank</a>  you Councilor Peters, Councilor Nathan, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=847.247s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=849.089s">I'd</a>  like to recommend maybe a committee of the whole on this paper so that we can go over it in further detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=854.276s">There</a>  are certainly some great aspects to it and some questions and concerns that I have relative to <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=859.042s">whether</a>  it applies to dumpster permits as well, whether or not we could extend this maybe to cover some compost files or some requirements around composting as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=868.728s">So</a>  with that being said, I'd offer the motion that we convene in the committee of the whole to go over this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=873.812s">I'll</a>  second that.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=874.372s">Do</a>  you want to do that as a B paper, Councilor Layton?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=881.817s">It</a>  would be the motions to just have a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=884.359s">So</a>  I don't know if it has to be a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=885.8s">I'm</a>  not amending it in any way.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=887.18s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=891.369s">seconded</a>  by councilor Scarpelli to have a committee to hold regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=895.831s">This</a>  issue, or more specifically to have a committee to hold regarding 20-519. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=900.755s">Clerk,</a>  please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=903.917s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=905.397s">Council</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=907.78s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=909.461s">And</a>  I want to thank my other colleagues for putting this on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=912.964s">You</a>  know, this has been, I probably put this on the agenda for the last four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=917.248s">And</a>  it's been a major issue in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=919.99s">Originally,</a>  it started out in South Method on the Somerville Method line. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=924.113s">Then</a>  the Heights received a large amount of infestation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=929.158s">The</a>  Wellington area, which I live in, was recently baited and trapped. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=934.702s">put</a>  down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=935.923s">And</a>  I think as part of an ordinance, you know, I like this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=941.507s">I</a>  think it needs to be properly vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=943.128s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=945.109s">However,</a>  we do have to look at enforcement, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=949.012s">Many</a>  residents in this community are complaining about people leaving trash outside <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=954.876s">food</a>  in the backyard, leaving open invitation for these vermins to come in and feed and feast. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=963.784s">And</a>  that's why they're hanging around. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=966.186s">Another</a>  issue, Mr. President, is, in my opinion, the lack of baiting and trapping in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=972.251s">We're</a>  not as aggressive as I believe we should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=974.953s">And</a>  that's, I think, a discussion we need to have with the city administration when we start vetting out the ordinance itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=982.058s">The</a>  last point, Mr. President, I have is regarding private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=987.642s">I've</a>  heard all too many times when the city goes out and they start doing their baiting and trapping that they've witnessed Borrowing and nest on private property and I can understand the city can't be the gatekeeper for everyone's property however, if there's a nuisance of a property that's in a particular neighborhood and the city's aware they can see that there's nest and infiltration and <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1013.477s">and</a>  so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1014.838s">I</a>  think more needs to be done, Mr. President, to work with homeowners and maybe work with absentee landlords that may not give a damn, that don't live in the area, to be quite honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1025.501s">And</a>  I think we have to do more as a community to safeguard the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1029.722s">And</a>  if we do locate these nests that are borrowed into private property, I think the concern should be with the residents as well as the city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1040.406s">And</a>  I think that'll go a long way to curbing <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1043.767s">the</a>  rat problem that we've had in the community for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1048.99s">This</a>  is not a recent issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1051.611s">It's</a>  not because of just recent construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1054.533s">This</a>  has been ongoing for many, many years in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1057.274s">And</a>  I look forward to having a dialogue, Mr. President, where we can address this by city ordinance and also by enforcement and outreach, which needs to happen as well in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1069.361s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1070.221s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1072.1s">Any</a>  other councils like to speak on this issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1074.062s">Councilor</a>  Knight and then Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1075.803s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1076.904s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1078.366s">And</a>  building on what Councilor Marks had to say, I think it makes great sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1083.09s">You</a>  know, government's constructed to help people. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1085.232s">Government's</a>  constructed to deliver services. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1087.614s">It</a>  shouldn't be an us versus them situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1090.297s">When</a>  someone calls and says they have an infestation problem in the neighborhood, that's a serious issue and a serious problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1095.862s">You</a>  know, it's gross, quite frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1097.865s">I</a>  mean, government should be reaching out and doing all they can to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1100.568s">And</a>  the property line should not be the determining factor as to whether or not individuals are going to be receiving government services, especially here at the local level. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1108.496s">You</a>  know, I think that moving forward, enforcement is going to be an issue, but also our Board of Health reaching out and helping residents when they run into this situation, circumstance and helping them bait and coming up with a road and abatement plan for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1120.467s">And</a>  maybe having some of these funds from the revolving account used to go back into the community to help people who are facing infestations, being able to fund some extermination services. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1129.879s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'm looking forward to meeting on this.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1134.385s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1134.645s">God</a>  tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1135.566s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1137.989s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1138.81s">Again,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1140.142s">Council</a>  marks mentioned many of the things that I was never but I agree with them that we have to step up with the people that are beating these companies are supposed to be doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1149.354s">They</a>  need to increase what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1151.196s">Also,</a>  like he said, you know, we've got many abandoned properties in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1157.184s">with</a>  absentee landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1158.626s">And</a>  it isn't just the abandoned properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1160.788s">Also,</a>  there's many, many, many abandoned vehicles in people's driveways and on side streets that have been sitting there for years that have now become rodent traps. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1172.712s">So</a>  again, I think we do need to sit down with our committee and more sooner than later, because as I said, there is construction going on pretty much everywhere in the city that you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1184.614s">So</a>  Mr. President, if you could call a committee at the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1188.175s">I</a>  know we've got many on the agenda, but if you can kind of move this one to the head a little quicker, it'd be greatly appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1197.197s">And</a>  I think the residents would be appreciated, especially with all the construction that's going on around the city right now.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1203.255s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1204.476s">Any</a>  other questions or comments from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1208.92s">Mr.</a>  President?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1210.561s">Councilor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1212.022s">Just</a>  if I could, as we all know, we also have many state roads and state parcels of land in the community, which the city is not responsible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1222.11s">And</a>  I need to say that I did reach out immediately to Representative Donato because it was the Wellington area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1230.254s">And</a>  he was quick to respond, Mr. President, regarding concerns and quick to address it on the state level as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1237.42s">And</a>  I just want to thank Representative Donato for his work.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1240.923s">Any</a>  other questions or comments from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1246.168s">Okay,</a>  seeing and hearing none, any questions or comments from the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1260.026s">Yeah,</a>  do you see anybody's hands up? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1262.108s">I</a>  don't see anyone, but I just wanna make sure I didn't miss anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1265.27s">Actually,</a>  let me unmute you.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1266.491s">You're</a>  still muted.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1275.538s">Sandy</a>  hasn't seen anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1276.659s">I</a>  can read his lips.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1277.619s">Oh,</a>  okay, good. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1278.7s">Good</a>  job, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1279.961s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1282.343s">Okay,</a>  so with that being said, the first vote will be to merge all these papers together under 20-519. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1289.352s">So</a>  on that motion to merge these papers together, Clerk Curnaby, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1295.376s">And</a>  I believe Councilor Knight made the original motion to merge. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1298.197s">And</a>  I believe it was, I don't actually see a second on the original motion.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1305.522s">I</a>  believe it was Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1410.642s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1412.583s">This</a>  is a resolution that is not intended to present another undue burden on our already struggling businesses that are facing the coronavirus epidemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1424.288s">However,</a>  I do think we can do a better job in presenting some curb appeal when we're doing some of these outdoor dining license and outdoor dining establishments, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1435.136s">For</a>  example, we've seen what they've done down at Bistro 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1438.719s">They</a>  put some lattice work up, they put a tent up, they put some lights up, and it looks nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1443.142s">But</a>  then you go to other places in the community and you see the concrete Jersey barrier taken up five parking spots, and that's all it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1449.406s">So</a>  I'm hoping that maybe we can implement some minimum beautification standards on the outdoor dining license, Mr. President, so that when we do have areas that need to be protected with Jersey barriers and the like, we also have some requirements and standards to <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1463.657s">maintain,</a>  keep, and improve our curb appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1465.522s">So</a>  that's the intention behind this resolution and I ask my council colleagues to support it.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1469.354s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1470.495s">We</a>  have Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1472.616s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1473.957s">Thank</a>  you, President Falco, and thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1478.12s">I</a>  do have a concern to follow up with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1482.842s">I</a>  got a few emails this week, a little too late to put it on the agenda, but it might help if we could, Councilor Knight would allow me to amend it to ask the, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1496.471s">the</a>  code enforcement officer, if they can go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1498.833s">I</a>  know that some of the Jersey barriers, I believe, in West Medford, I was told that it doesn't suffice for our residents in wheelchairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1512.962s">So</a>  I believe we have a few people in West Medford that traverse that area, and unfortunately, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1521.889s">couldn't</a>  make their way in front of a restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1525.813s">So</a>  if we can ask our city administrations, please, just to go out there and measure just to make sure that we're in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1533.06s">I</a>  think that beautification is important, but we still have to have safe <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1537.845s">pathways</a>  for our residents, especially our residents that need assistance to maneuver through that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1545.087s">So</a>  if you can, I make that as a motion if we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1548.508s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1548.868s">I</a>  have no opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1550.348s">I</a>  have no opposition to the amendment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1552.309s">Thanks,</a>  Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1553.229s">The</a>  resolution has been amended by Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1556.71s">We</a>  have now Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1559.318s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1560.018s">Yeah,</a>  I did have some residents reach out about this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1562.459s">So</a>  I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1564.299s">And</a>  I did speak with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1565.9s">Briseño</a>  in the Office of Community Development, and she did say the grant money that is being used for some of these Jersey barriers would allow for it to be used for decorations too. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1574.422s">So</a>  that's just helpful information for those businesses should this pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1578.103s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1579.543s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1580.884s">Any</a>  questions or comments from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1584.705s">Okay,</a>  seeing and hearing none, any questions from the public or any comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1590.495s">Okay,</a>  let's see, we have Chief of Staff Rodriguez, and then we have Susan Bibbins. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1596.286s">Let's</a>  see, Dave Rodriguez.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1599.413s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1600.333s">Thank</a>  you to the rest of the council as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1602.474s">It's</a>  a point certainly well taken for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1605.315s">We</a>  had a lengthy conversation with some staff this week regarding the beautification of some of these, especially the ones in which Jersey barriers were placed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1614.099s">And</a>  I know that we've engaged with conversations with the Chamber of Commerce to paint these things, make it more appealing, make it more aesthetically pleasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1621.682s">So</a>  it's certainly something that's on our radar screen for the upcoming future. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1625.702s">And</a>  if there are any concerns about ADA compliance or measurements or anything, please forward those to me or to the code enforcement officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1633.466s">We'll</a>  have you to look over those as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1635.787s">That's</a>  certainly a concern of ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1637.648s">When</a>  we did these measurings, we had a pretty deliberate and thoughtful ways to how we were doing it to make sure that that was in play when we were discussing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1645.931s">So,</a>  but things have moved around or if there's some compliance that we have to engage with, we're happy to do that as well.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1653.835s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1654.857s">Let's</a>  see, we have Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1657.919s">I</a>  would like to commend the administration, Mr. President, on getting the emergency outdoor dining licenses up and running in relatively fast order. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1666.646s">When</a>  the governor issued his executive order allowing outdoor dining licenses to be issued under the emergency order, the administration embraced it and ran with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1674.071s">So,</a>  you know, it's not to be critical of the job that they've done at all because they've done a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1679.155s">It's</a>  just a suggestion as to how we can improve. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1681.657s">So</a>  I appreciate the work that they've done.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1683.945s">That's</a>  certainly a point well taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1687.127s">We</a>  wanted to get them up and running so that they could survive and thrive first. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1690.869s">And</a>  now we're happy to make them integrated to the community, integrated to some of the squares as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1695.711s">So</a>  the regs weren't necessarily designed for a place like Medford, but we were certainly able to embrace it pretty quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1702.755s">The</a>  mayor made it a priority, and OCD did a great job pushing it through.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1708.778s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1710.379s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1711.28s">Susan</a>  Bibbins, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Susan Bibbins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1714.21s">My</a>  name is Susan Bivens, and I live in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1720.111s">I'm</a>  Ward 2, Precinct 8, or the other way around. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1729.413s">I'm</a>  the chair of the Commission for Persons with Disabilities, and I'd just like to remind you and <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1744.254s">I</a>  just want to caution you and charge everybody with making sure that the outdoor door dining establishment has <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1772.368s">clearance</a>  with your jersey barriers or whatever they put up and remember the corners and remember those curb cuts and that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1785.832s">So</a>  people with mobility challenges or using wheelchairs for mobility can have access to where they need to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1796.595s">So</a>  that's just my two cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1802.675s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1805.057s">Let's</a>  see, we have Vice President Caraviello had a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1809.08s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1811.021s">To</a>  the Chief of Staff, Dave, how long are these outdoor dining establishments gonna be out there till? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1819.127s">Do</a>  you have a date?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1820.528s">Yeah,</a>  the regs are active until November 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1822.91s">November</a>  1st? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1823.691s">Yeah,</a>  that's the window in which we have to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1826.053s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1827.388s">Again,</a>  just to reaffirm what Councilor Knight said, we appreciate all the effort to keep the businesses afloat and keep them going, but is there a way that maybe we can use some of that money to commission some of our high school students, our talented artists that have gone out and painted <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1850.455s">these</a>  utility boxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1852.678s">That</a>  might be an avenue that we could really help with those Jersey areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1857.045s">They're</a>  so talented. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1858.106s">You</a>  see it all over this community in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1860.49s">Maybe</a>  that might be an avenue that we can really invite our <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1865.837s">our</a>  community and we have so many of these blocks that might be something that if there's a way that the city can make that work or if that that we could you know bring some kids in for community service or or uh anything that uh would help that but just a suggestion thank you thank you council Scarpelli uh let's see any other questions from the council comments from the council okay seeing and hearing now we have a comment uh question from</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1895.198s">Is</a>  it Marcia?</p>

    <p>[Marcia Kirssen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1896.639s">Yeah,</a>  it's Marcia. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1897.58s">Yeah,</a>  hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1898.821s">I'm</a>  Marcia Cheerson, 11 Upton Terrace, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1903.104s">I</a>  want to thank you so much for thinking about accessibility in this project, because as those of you who must remember me from last year, I think it's really important if Medford can be a city that leads the way in <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1925.608s">in</a>  keeping that in mind for everything, all construction and all new regulations and to make the idea of accessibility as broad as possible because I'm sure you know by now that the ADA does not cover all accessibility needs by any means. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1947.811s">And</a>  I believe that Medford has the ability to be more forward thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1952.614s">And</a>  I thank you so much for hearing me about this so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1958.278s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1958.698s">Any</a>  other comments or questions from the public?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1967.143s">I</a>  think Rick Jordan may wanna speak, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2003.411s">Rick</a>  looks like he's on the beach. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2005.273s">He's</a>  got the picture of the beach with the rocks in the ocean. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2007.913s">I</a>  got him.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2015.155s">He's</a>  muted, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2016.455s">I'm</a>  having trouble unmuting him.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2017.535s">All</a>  right, let me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2022.076s">I</a>  do not have a question at this time, but I cannot raise my hand for a future discussion and was not able to in the past few meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2031.538s">I</a>  have a Windows computer.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2036.012s">Rick,</a>  do you have a question now, Rick? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2037.613s">I'm</a>  sorry, I missed that first part.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2039.294s">No,</a>  not currently, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2040.955s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2042.016s">Okay,</a>  I believe Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2049.501s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2050.842s">And</a>  it's really up to Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2053.463s">I</a>  was wondering if we could amend this to also make sure that as Susan and as folks have said that we <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2062.83s">make</a>  sure that this is looking at access for people with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2067.311s">If</a>  we're going down there for beautification, we might as well make sure there's the necessary clearance for people who need access.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2075.012s">With</a>  all due respect to the commentary around ADA compliance, that's the standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2080.194s">That</a>  should be happening regardless of what's going on in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2084.394s">I</a>  think that it might be important for us if we do have some locations or sites in the city that we ask our ADA compliance officer, the director of diversity to go down there and check it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2093.107s">You</a>  know, it certainly won't take anything away from the resolution, so I have no problem with you putting it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2097.351s">But</a>  the sole principle and purpose was for us to, you know, create some standards and beautification standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2104.877s">ADA</a>  compliance is always an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2106.438s">It's</a>  always something that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2107.839s">It's</a>  always something that we should be focused on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2109.42s">So</a>  I have no problem amending the paper to reflect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2112.403s">However,</a>  I don't want it to detract from the principal goal and objective.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2115.952s">No,</a>  and I appreciate the principle. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2117.433s">I</a>  think it's really important that we do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2120.414s">And</a>  it's just, if we're going down there to look at the beautification, it's another opportunity to check those distances. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2124.857s">So</a>  I appreciate that, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2128.819s">So</a>  you are amending Council of Heirs?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2132.32s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2133.061s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2135.222s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2136.402s">Any</a>  other questions from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2139.484s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2140.264s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2145.333s">Second,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2146.274s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello as amended by Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2151.737s">Clerk</a>  Cunabese, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2169.167s">Yes,</a>  so the affirmative and the negative, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2171.829s">2-0-505</a>  offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request the city solicitor provide a draft zoning amendment authorizing the construction of accessory dwelling units for council deliberation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2185.579s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2187.341s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2189.202s">Accessory</a>  use dwelling is a self-contained apartment in a single family homeless owner occupied attached <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2197.71s">or</a>  in a separate structure on the same lot of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2200.712s">Many</a>  times these are referred to as in-law apartments or granny flats is another term that I've seen raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2209.699s">But</a>  what accessory dwelling units will allow us to do is to create more affordable housing stock in our community and more housing stock in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2218.806s">We</a>  hear a lot about people that are being overhoused, people that are single living in a two, three or four bedroom home. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2225.46s">But</a>  because there's a lack of stock and a lack of affordable stock, especially, there are many downsides. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2232.104s">So</a>  Mr. President, looking at what's going on in our community, the cry for more affordable housing and more housing stock in the greater Boston area, and the fact that studies would show that by allowing accessory dwelling units, assessments go up anywhere between <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2250.178s">25</a>  to 34% in communities that allow accessory dwelling units in terms of property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2254.522s">I</a>  think it's something that's very worthy of review, examination and debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2261.147s">Previously,</a>  the city of Medford did allow accessory dwelling units and they allowed them well before any of our time, well before Mr. Moki's time through what was called the restrictive covenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2272.036s">And</a>  that restrictive covenant was filed at the registry of deeds saying that when this parcel changed hands, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2277.636s">that</a>  the accessory dwelling unit, which would have a kitchen and a bathroom in it, the kitchen would be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2281.858s">It</a>  would not be sold as a multifamily dwelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2284.52s">So</a>  that's something we can also take a look at, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2287.561s">Obviously,</a>  the restrictive covenant became something that became difficult to enforce, and that's why it fell by the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2292.404s">So</a>  that may not be the best way to move about it, but it is an option for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2296.286s">So</a>  with that being said, I think that it would make sense for the building commissioner and the city solicitor to provide us with a draft for us to debate, deliberate, and hopefully discuss with Mr. Bob Roski. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2307.919s">I've</a>  had the opportunity of speaking with Andrew a little about this from our community development board at great lengths. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2313.801s">Andrew</a>  is an expert in smart growth and accessory dwelling, accessory use dwellings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2319.422s">So,</a>  you know, he provides us with a vast array of expertise and knowledge in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2323.844s">And</a>  I think that this is something that the community development board would be excited to work with us on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2329.165s">So</a>  with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support the measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2332.426s">And,</a>  you know, when we talk about accessories dwellings, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2336.402s">an</a>  apartment above a garage, Mr. President, or a small home in a backyard, you know, with the setbacks and zoning allows for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2344.408s">So</a>  I think that that's, you know, a backyard cottage, something like that, a basement apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2348.391s">But</a>  just the housing options for people, you know, you know, someone who has aging parents, you know, I think that an accessory dwelling unit will be great for someone in my situation where I have a wife, young kids and an aging father who has his independence, but I would like to have him closer to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2363.482s">You</a>  know, so those are just some things that we need to talk about and discuss, especially when we look at the city of Medford, the desire for us all to age in place and the opportunities and options that are out there and the limits that are surrounding them at this point in time, I think make this a good measure to pursue and to take a look at Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2384.026s">So</a>  with that being said, I rest my case and I'll ask my council colleagues to support the endeavor.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2388.467s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2390.308s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2393.894s">second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2394.214s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2395.935s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2397.495s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2398.375s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2399.596s">I'm</a>  right there with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2400.396s">I</a>  think that was an incredible explanation and I think this is something we should do for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2406.318s">So</a>  I'm supportive of this and supportive of deliberating on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2409.339s">I</a>  was wondering if we could add a B paper just to get an update from the solicitor's office on the status of some ordinance we've requested and also whether or not KP Law is helping out with ordinance drafting.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2427.348s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2427.568s">So</a>  the, uh, so the B paper, uh, clerk, do you have the language for the B paper?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2431.452s">Mr.</a>  President in light of, um, in light of the events that have transpired over the past, uh, since January now, eight months, nine months, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2450.769s">the</a>  number of ordinances that we've requested to be drafted and the number of ordinances that have come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2454.972s">I</a>  think it might be worthwhile for us to schedule a committee of the whole with representatives from the solicitor's office and the city solicitor to get an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2463.979s">I</a>  filed the resolution maybe 90 days ago seeking for monthly updates as to where we are in the status of the requested draft ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2471.45s">And</a>  that's something that I think that we should pursue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2474.191s">We</a>  haven't gotten an update on the status of any of our draft ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2477.251s">So</a>  it might make sense for us to call a committee of the whole so we can be brought up to speed as to where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2481.772s">That's</a>  the council work product. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2483.733s">I</a>  certainly support Councilor Behr's resolution, but I think that it might make more sense for us instead of to get a report back, but to actually have a meeting and get all get in the same room where we can talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2493.395s">So</a>  that would be the only request that I make is that he just changed the language in his amendment to require a committee of the whole as opposed to report back from the administration.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2501.848s">I</a>  would support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2502.569s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2505.611s">Clark,</a>  do you have that language?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2508.214s">So</a>  the B paper has been changed rather than an update from the solicitor's office on the status of ordinances requested by the council and whether KP law is helping out with the drafting of the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2521.845s">You</a>  want to committee the whole on that?</p>
