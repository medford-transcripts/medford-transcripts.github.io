    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1.752s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2.973s">Pursuant</a>  to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law, General Law Chapter 38, Section 18, and the Governor's March 15, 2020 order imposing strict limitation on the number of people that may gather in one place, this meeting of the Medford City Council will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=22.663s">Specific</a>  information and the general guidelines for remote participation by members of the public and or parties with a right and or requirement to attend this meeting can be found on the City of Medford website at www.medfordma.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=36.9s">For</a>  this meeting members of the public who wish to listen or watch the meeting may do so by accessing the meeting link contained herein. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=43.713s">No</a>  in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings in real time via technological means. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=53.237s">In</a>  the event that we are unable to do so, despite best efforts, we will post on the City of Medford or Medford Community Media website an audio or video recording transcript or other comprehensive record of proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=66.323s">Okay,</a>  I just wanted to, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=72.109s">just</a>  make a quick statement regarding these meetings here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=76.093s">So</a>  last week we had a Committee of the Whole meeting at City Council Chambers, and the public was able to access the meeting via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=84.238s">Tonight,</a>  the council members are back home, accessing the meeting via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=89.101s">The</a>  reason why we are doing this from home tonight is we have early voting this week in City Hall, and I know Clerk Hurtubise has been working hard at that since Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=99.487s">I</a>  know that's been taking up most of his time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=102.869s">They</a>  have the tabulation machines behind the rails and they would have to move everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=106.372s">So</a>  this should be, uh, hopefully the last time that the council has to log in from their homes and we can do it, uh, in council chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=114.417s">The</a>  council can meet in council chambers going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=117.299s">Uh,</a>  and so that is the plan, but I just wanted to explain that before we get started.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=641.633s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=642.553s">Thank</a>  you to the rest of the council as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=645.294s">The</a>  draft ordinance that's being presented by the mayor tonight would add Chapter 71 to the revised ordinances of the city and would establish road and control measures that are in place for building construction, road construction, as well as establishing and requiring plans to be put forth for mitigation from restaurants and other businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=666.918s">There's</a>  also a fee structure that's in place that would <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=669.898s">provide</a>  that would be put into a revolving account, which is also being created by the proposed measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=675.9s">The</a>  purpose of which would be to support rodent mitigation and other measures that directly work towards mitigating rodents, rats, mice throughout the community as the result of any number of issues and whether not just construction, but also we all know that rats and other vermin <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=697.088s">they</a>  thrive where there's water and there's food, and we need to try to do that in a densely populated area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=702.25s">So</a>  this is a pretty, we view this as a pretty progressive and aggressive way in order to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=709.232s">And</a>  we look forward to having a conversation with the council and the community at large to put the measure forward in order to address the multiple items that were put forth by the council and the community in recent times.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=721.956s">Chief</a>  of Staff Rodriguez, Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=726.145s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=727.126s">And</a>  thank you to my fellow Councilors for many of you for bringing this issue up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=731.71s">I</a>  just have a couple of questions, Dave. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=735.134s">In</a>  terms of the fee structure, how did you arrive at the amounts that you arrived at? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=741.319s">And</a>  is there an estimate of how much this might raise over a year?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=744.002s">We</a>  tried to do it as fairly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=749.638s">And</a>  this was a conversation that the mayor rolled up her sleeves personally and really dove in with Maryann O'Connor and a number of individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=756.022s">And</a>  we looked at what other communities were doing in terms of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=760.224s">So</a>  the fee structure is in line with what other cities and towns are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=764.526s">You</a>  will see that there is no fee that's related to restaurants and other small businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=772.202s">that</a>  was included, but in light of some of the challenging times that are being faced by restaurants and small businesses, given the economic times, that fee was removed as part of this proposal and can certainly be added in later as part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=785.764s">They</a>  will certainly have to also submit an IPM, which is with the plan, that's part of it, but there's no fee associated with those measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=794.806s">So</a>  what other cities and towns are doing, try to bring it in line with that and try to be as fair as possible.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=802.46s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=802.76s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=803.02s">And</a>  then just kind of on that general scope, um, you know, how much might this raise in a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=808.242s">What</a>  is the general cost of some of the road and abatement measures that you want to implement and that we all want to see implemented? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=814.324s">And</a>  like, would these fees provide enough revenue to accomplish the goal?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=818.946s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=819.346s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=819.686s">I</a>  don't have the exact figure as to what, if we've modeled this out yet, but I can certainly get that information for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=825.318s">And</a>  I can touch base with Marian O'Connor, who is on a very well-deserved vacation at the moment, to get the exact amount of which we've spent on road mitigation and baiting and trapping in the last couple of months, especially as we've seen an increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=839.644s">So</a>  I can get that information for you, no problem.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=841.725s">Thanks,</a>  Dave. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=842.165s">Super</a>  helpful.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=843.582s">Thank</a>  you Councilor Peters, Councilor Nathan, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=847.247s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=849.089s">I'd</a>  like to recommend maybe a committee of the whole on this paper so that we can go over it in further detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=854.276s">There</a>  are certainly some great aspects to it and some questions and concerns that I have relative to <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=859.042s">whether</a>  it applies to dumpster permits as well, whether or not we could extend this maybe to cover some compost files or some requirements around composting as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=868.728s">So</a>  with that being said, I'd offer the motion that we convene in the committee of the whole to go over this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=873.812s">I'll</a>  second that.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=874.372s">Do</a>  you want to do that as a B paper, Councilor Layton?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=881.817s">It</a>  would be the motions to just have a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=884.359s">So</a>  I don't know if it has to be a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=885.8s">I'm</a>  not amending it in any way.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=887.18s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=891.369s">seconded</a>  by councilor Scarpelli to have a committee to hold regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=895.831s">This</a>  issue, or more specifically to have a committee to hold regarding 20-519. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=900.755s">Clerk,</a>  please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=903.917s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=905.397s">Council</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=907.78s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=909.461s">And</a>  I want to thank my other colleagues for putting this on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=912.964s">You</a>  know, this has been, I probably put this on the agenda for the last four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=917.248s">And</a>  it's been a major issue in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=919.99s">Originally,</a>  it started out in South Method on the Somerville Method line. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=924.113s">Then</a>  the Heights received a large amount of infestation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=929.158s">The</a>  Wellington area, which I live in, was recently baited and trapped. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=934.702s">put</a>  down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=935.923s">And</a>  I think as part of an ordinance, you know, I like this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=941.507s">I</a>  think it needs to be properly vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=943.128s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=945.109s">However,</a>  we do have to look at enforcement, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=949.012s">Many</a>  residents in this community are complaining about people leaving trash outside <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=954.876s">food</a>  in the backyard, leaving open invitation for these vermins to come in and feed and feast. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=963.784s">And</a>  that's why they're hanging around. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=966.186s">Another</a>  issue, Mr. President, is, in my opinion, the lack of baiting and trapping in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=972.251s">We're</a>  not as aggressive as I believe we should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=974.953s">And</a>  that's, I think, a discussion we need to have with the city administration when we start vetting out the ordinance itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=982.058s">The</a>  last point, Mr. President, I have is regarding private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=987.642s">I've</a>  heard all too many times when the city goes out and they start doing their baiting and trapping that they've witnessed Borrowing and nest on private property and I can understand the city can't be the gatekeeper for everyone's property however, if there's a nuisance of a property that's in a particular neighborhood and the city's aware they can see that there's nest and infiltration and <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1013.477s">and</a>  so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1014.838s">I</a>  think more needs to be done, Mr. President, to work with homeowners and maybe work with absentee landlords that may not give a damn, that don't live in the area, to be quite honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1025.501s">And</a>  I think we have to do more as a community to safeguard the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1029.722s">And</a>  if we do locate these nests that are borrowed into private property, I think the concern should be with the residents as well as the city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1040.406s">And</a>  I think that'll go a long way to curbing <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1043.767s">the</a>  rat problem that we've had in the community for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1048.99s">This</a>  is not a recent issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1051.611s">It's</a>  not because of just recent construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1054.533s">This</a>  has been ongoing for many, many years in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1057.274s">And</a>  I look forward to having a dialogue, Mr. President, where we can address this by city ordinance and also by enforcement and outreach, which needs to happen as well in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1069.361s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1070.221s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1072.1s">Any</a>  other councils like to speak on this issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1074.062s">Councilor</a>  Knight and then Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1075.803s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1076.904s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1078.366s">And</a>  building on what Councilor Marks had to say, I think it makes great sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1083.09s">You</a>  know, government's constructed to help people. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1085.232s">Government's</a>  constructed to deliver services. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1087.614s">It</a>  shouldn't be an us versus them situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1090.297s">When</a>  someone calls and says they have an infestation problem in the neighborhood, that's a serious issue and a serious problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1095.862s">You</a>  know, it's gross, quite frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1097.865s">I</a>  mean, government should be reaching out and doing all they can to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1100.568s">And</a>  the property line should not be the determining factor as to whether or not individuals are going to be receiving government services, especially here at the local level. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1108.496s">You</a>  know, I think that moving forward, enforcement is going to be an issue, but also our Board of Health reaching out and helping residents when they run into this situation, circumstance and helping them bait and coming up with a road and abatement plan for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1120.467s">And</a>  maybe having some of these funds from the revolving account used to go back into the community to help people who are facing infestations, being able to fund some extermination services. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1129.879s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'm looking forward to meeting on this.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1134.385s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1134.645s">God</a>  tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1135.566s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1137.989s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1138.81s">Again,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1140.142s">Council</a>  marks mentioned many of the things that I was never but I agree with them that we have to step up with the people that are beating these companies are supposed to be doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1149.354s">They</a>  need to increase what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1151.196s">Also,</a>  like he said, you know, we've got many abandoned properties in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1157.184s">with</a>  absentee landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1158.626s">And</a>  it isn't just the abandoned properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1160.788s">Also,</a>  there's many, many, many abandoned vehicles in people's driveways and on side streets that have been sitting there for years that have now become rodent traps. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1172.712s">So</a>  again, I think we do need to sit down with our committee and more sooner than later, because as I said, there is construction going on pretty much everywhere in the city that you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1184.614s">So</a>  Mr. President, if you could call a committee at the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1188.175s">I</a>  know we've got many on the agenda, but if you can kind of move this one to the head a little quicker, it'd be greatly appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1197.197s">And</a>  I think the residents would be appreciated, especially with all the construction that's going on around the city right now.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1203.255s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1204.476s">Any</a>  other questions or comments from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1208.92s">Mr.</a>  President?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1210.561s">Councilor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1212.022s">Just</a>  if I could, as we all know, we also have many state roads and state parcels of land in the community, which the city is not responsible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1222.11s">And</a>  I need to say that I did reach out immediately to Representative Donato because it was the Wellington area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1230.254s">And</a>  he was quick to respond, Mr. President, regarding concerns and quick to address it on the state level as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1237.42s">And</a>  I just want to thank Representative Donato for his work.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1240.923s">Any</a>  other questions or comments from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1246.168s">Okay,</a>  seeing and hearing none, any questions or comments from the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1260.026s">Yeah,</a>  do you see anybody's hands up? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1262.108s">I</a>  don't see anyone, but I just wanna make sure I didn't miss anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1265.27s">Actually,</a>  let me unmute you.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1266.491s">You're</a>  still muted.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1275.538s">Sandy</a>  hasn't seen anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1276.659s">I</a>  can read his lips.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1277.619s">Oh,</a>  okay, good. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1278.7s">Good</a>  job, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1279.961s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1282.343s">Okay,</a>  so with that being said, the first vote will be to merge all these papers together under 20-519. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1289.352s">So</a>  on that motion to merge these papers together, Clerk Curnaby, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1295.376s">And</a>  I believe Councilor Knight made the original motion to merge. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1298.197s">And</a>  I believe it was, I don't actually see a second on the original motion.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1305.522s">I</a>  believe it was Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1410.642s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1412.583s">This</a>  is a resolution that is not intended to present another undue burden on our already struggling businesses that are facing the coronavirus epidemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1424.288s">However,</a>  I do think we can do a better job in presenting some curb appeal when we're doing some of these outdoor dining license and outdoor dining establishments, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1435.136s">For</a>  example, we've seen what they've done down at Bistro 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1438.719s">They</a>  put some lattice work up, they put a tent up, they put some lights up, and it looks nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1443.142s">But</a>  then you go to other places in the community and you see the concrete Jersey barrier taken up five parking spots, and that's all it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1449.406s">So</a>  I'm hoping that maybe we can implement some minimum beautification standards on the outdoor dining license, Mr. President, so that when we do have areas that need to be protected with Jersey barriers and the like, we also have some requirements and standards to <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1463.657s">maintain,</a>  keep, and improve our curb appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1465.522s">So</a>  that's the intention behind this resolution and I ask my council colleagues to support it.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1469.354s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1470.495s">We</a>  have Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1472.616s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1473.957s">Thank</a>  you, President Falco, and thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1478.12s">I</a>  do have a concern to follow up with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1482.842s">I</a>  got a few emails this week, a little too late to put it on the agenda, but it might help if we could, Councilor Knight would allow me to amend it to ask the, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1496.471s">the</a>  code enforcement officer, if they can go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1498.833s">I</a>  know that some of the Jersey barriers, I believe, in West Medford, I was told that it doesn't suffice for our residents in wheelchairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1512.962s">So</a>  I believe we have a few people in West Medford that traverse that area, and unfortunately, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1521.889s">couldn't</a>  make their way in front of a restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1525.813s">So</a>  if we can ask our city administrations, please, just to go out there and measure just to make sure that we're in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1533.06s">I</a>  think that beautification is important, but we still have to have safe <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1537.845s">pathways</a>  for our residents, especially our residents that need assistance to maneuver through that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1545.087s">So</a>  if you can, I make that as a motion if we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1548.508s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1548.868s">I</a>  have no opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1550.348s">I</a>  have no opposition to the amendment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1552.309s">Thanks,</a>  Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1553.229s">The</a>  resolution has been amended by Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1556.71s">We</a>  have now Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1559.318s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1560.018s">Yeah,</a>  I did have some residents reach out about this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1562.459s">So</a>  I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1564.299s">And</a>  I did speak with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1565.9s">Briseño</a>  in the Office of Community Development, and she did say the grant money that is being used for some of these Jersey barriers would allow for it to be used for decorations too. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1574.422s">So</a>  that's just helpful information for those businesses should this pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1578.103s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1579.543s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1580.884s">Any</a>  questions or comments from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1584.705s">Okay,</a>  seeing and hearing none, any questions from the public or any comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1590.495s">Okay,</a>  let's see, we have Chief of Staff Rodriguez, and then we have Susan Bibbins. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1596.286s">Let's</a>  see, Dave Rodriguez.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1599.413s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1600.333s">Thank</a>  you to the rest of the council as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1602.474s">It's</a>  a point certainly well taken for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1605.315s">We</a>  had a lengthy conversation with some staff this week regarding the beautification of some of these, especially the ones in which Jersey barriers were placed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1614.099s">And</a>  I know that we've engaged with conversations with the Chamber of Commerce to paint these things, make it more appealing, make it more aesthetically pleasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1621.682s">So</a>  it's certainly something that's on our radar screen for the upcoming future. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1625.702s">And</a>  if there are any concerns about ADA compliance or measurements or anything, please forward those to me or to the code enforcement officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1633.466s">We'll</a>  have you to look over those as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1635.787s">That's</a>  certainly a concern of ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1637.648s">When</a>  we did these measurings, we had a pretty deliberate and thoughtful ways to how we were doing it to make sure that that was in play when we were discussing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1645.931s">So,</a>  but things have moved around or if there's some compliance that we have to engage with, we're happy to do that as well.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1653.835s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1654.857s">Let's</a>  see, we have Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1657.919s">I</a>  would like to commend the administration, Mr. President, on getting the emergency outdoor dining licenses up and running in relatively fast order. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1666.646s">When</a>  the governor issued his executive order allowing outdoor dining licenses to be issued under the emergency order, the administration embraced it and ran with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1674.071s">So,</a>  you know, it's not to be critical of the job that they've done at all because they've done a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1679.155s">It's</a>  just a suggestion as to how we can improve. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1681.657s">So</a>  I appreciate the work that they've done.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1683.945s">That's</a>  certainly a point well taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1687.127s">We</a>  wanted to get them up and running so that they could survive and thrive first. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1690.869s">And</a>  now we're happy to make them integrated to the community, integrated to some of the squares as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1695.711s">So</a>  the regs weren't necessarily designed for a place like Medford, but we were certainly able to embrace it pretty quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1702.755s">The</a>  mayor made it a priority, and OCD did a great job pushing it through.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1708.778s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1710.379s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1711.28s">Susan</a>  Bibbins, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1714.21s">My</a>  name is Susan Bivens, and I live in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1720.111s">I'm</a>  Ward 2, Precinct 8, or the other way around. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1729.413s">I'm</a>  the chair of the Commission for Persons with Disabilities, and I'd just like to remind you and <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1744.254s">I</a>  just want to caution you and charge everybody with making sure that the outdoor door dining establishment has <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1772.368s">clearance</a>  with your jersey barriers or whatever they put up and remember the corners and remember those curb cuts and that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1785.832s">So</a>  people with mobility challenges or using wheelchairs for mobility can have access to where they need to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1796.595s">So</a>  that's just my two cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1802.675s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1805.057s">Let's</a>  see, we have Vice President Caraviello had a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1809.08s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1811.021s">To</a>  the Chief of Staff, Dave, how long are these outdoor dining establishments gonna be out there till? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1819.127s">Do</a>  you have a date?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1820.528s">Yeah,</a>  the regs are active until November 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1822.91s">November</a>  1st? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1823.691s">Yeah,</a>  that's the window in which we have to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1826.053s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1827.388s">Again,</a>  just to reaffirm what Councilor Knight said, we appreciate all the effort to keep the businesses afloat and keep them going, but is there a way that maybe we can use some of that money to commission some of our high school students, our talented artists that have gone out and painted <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1850.455s">these</a>  utility boxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1852.678s">That</a>  might be an avenue that we could really help with those Jersey areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1857.045s">They're</a>  so talented. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1858.106s">You</a>  see it all over this community in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1860.49s">Maybe</a>  that might be an avenue that we can really invite our <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1865.837s">our</a>  community and we have so many of these blocks that might be something that if there's a way that the city can make that work or if that that we could you know bring some kids in for community service or or uh anything that uh would help that but just a suggestion thank you thank you council Scarpelli uh let's see any other questions from the council comments from the council okay seeing and hearing now we have a comment uh question from</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1895.198s">Is</a>  it Marcia?</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1896.639s">Yeah,</a>  it's Marcia. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1897.58s">Yeah,</a>  hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1898.821s">I'm</a>  Marcia Cheerson, 11 Upton Terrace, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1903.104s">I</a>  want to thank you so much for thinking about accessibility in this project, because as those of you who must remember me from last year, I think it's really important if Medford can be a city that leads the way in <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1925.608s">in</a>  keeping that in mind for everything, all construction and all new regulations and to make the idea of accessibility as broad as possible because I'm sure you know by now that the ADA does not cover all accessibility needs by any means. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1947.811s">And</a>  I believe that Medford has the ability to be more forward thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1952.614s">And</a>  I thank you so much for hearing me about this so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1958.278s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1958.698s">Any</a>  other comments or questions from the public?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1967.143s">I</a>  think Rick Jordan may wanna speak, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2003.411s">Rick</a>  looks like he's on the beach. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2005.273s">He's</a>  got the picture of the beach with the rocks in the ocean. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2007.913s">I</a>  got him.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2015.155s">He's</a>  muted, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2016.455s">I'm</a>  having trouble unmuting him.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2017.535s">All</a>  right, let me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2022.076s">I</a>  do not have a question at this time, but I cannot raise my hand for a future discussion and was not able to in the past few meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2031.538s">I</a>  have a Windows computer.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2036.012s">Rick,</a>  do you have a question now, Rick? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2037.613s">I'm</a>  sorry, I missed that first part.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2039.294s">No,</a>  not currently, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2040.955s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2042.016s">Okay,</a>  I believe Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2049.501s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2050.842s">And</a>  it's really up to Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2053.463s">I</a>  was wondering if we could amend this to also make sure that as Susan and as folks have said that we <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2062.83s">make</a>  sure that this is looking at access for people with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2067.311s">If</a>  we're going down there for beautification, we might as well make sure there's the necessary clearance for people who need access.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2075.012s">With</a>  all due respect to the commentary around ADA compliance, that's the standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2080.194s">That</a>  should be happening regardless of what's going on in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2084.394s">I</a>  think that it might be important for us if we do have some locations or sites in the city that we ask our ADA compliance officer, the director of diversity to go down there and check it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2093.107s">You</a>  know, it certainly won't take anything away from the resolution, so I have no problem with you putting it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2097.351s">But</a>  the sole principle and purpose was for us to, you know, create some standards and beautification standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2104.877s">ADA</a>  compliance is always an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2106.438s">It's</a>  always something that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2107.839s">It's</a>  always something that we should be focused on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2109.42s">So</a>  I have no problem amending the paper to reflect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2112.403s">However,</a>  I don't want it to detract from the principal goal and objective.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2115.952s">No,</a>  and I appreciate the principle. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2117.433s">I</a>  think it's really important that we do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2120.414s">And</a>  it's just, if we're going down there to look at the beautification, it's another opportunity to check those distances. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2124.857s">So</a>  I appreciate that, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2128.819s">So</a>  you are amending Council of Heirs?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2132.32s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2133.061s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2135.222s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2136.402s">Any</a>  other questions from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2139.484s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2140.264s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2145.333s">Second,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2146.274s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello as amended by Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2151.737s">Clerk</a>  Cunabese, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2169.167s">Yes,</a>  so the affirmative and the negative, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2171.829s">2-0-505</a>  offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request the city solicitor provide a draft zoning amendment authorizing the construction of accessory dwelling units for council deliberation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2185.579s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2187.341s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2189.202s">Accessory</a>  use dwelling is a self-contained apartment in a single family homeless owner occupied attached <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2197.71s">or</a>  in a separate structure on the same lot of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2200.712s">Many</a>  times these are referred to as in-law apartments or granny flats is another term that I've seen raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2209.699s">But</a>  what accessory dwelling units will allow us to do is to create more affordable housing stock in our community and more housing stock in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2218.806s">We</a>  hear a lot about people that are being overhoused, people that are single living in a two, three or four bedroom home. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2225.46s">But</a>  because there's a lack of stock and a lack of affordable stock, especially, there are many downsides. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2232.104s">So</a>  Mr. President, looking at what's going on in our community, the cry for more affordable housing and more housing stock in the greater Boston area, and the fact that studies would show that by allowing accessory dwelling units, assessments go up anywhere between <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2250.178s">25</a>  to 34% in communities that allow accessory dwelling units in terms of property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2254.522s">I</a>  think it's something that's very worthy of review, examination and debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2261.147s">Previously,</a>  the city of Medford did allow accessory dwelling units and they allowed them well before any of our time, well before Mr. Moki's time through what was called the restrictive covenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2272.036s">And</a>  that restrictive covenant was filed at the registry of deeds saying that when this parcel changed hands, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2277.636s">that</a>  the accessory dwelling unit, which would have a kitchen and a bathroom in it, the kitchen would be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2281.858s">It</a>  would not be sold as a multifamily dwelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2284.52s">So</a>  that's something we can also take a look at, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2287.561s">Obviously,</a>  the restrictive covenant became something that became difficult to enforce, and that's why it fell by the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2292.404s">So</a>  that may not be the best way to move about it, but it is an option for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2296.286s">So</a>  with that being said, I think that it would make sense for the building commissioner and the city solicitor to provide us with a draft for us to debate, deliberate, and hopefully discuss with Mr. Bob Roski. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2307.919s">I've</a>  had the opportunity of speaking with Andrew a little about this from our community development board at great lengths. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2313.801s">Andrew</a>  is an expert in smart growth and accessory dwelling, accessory use dwellings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2319.422s">So,</a>  you know, he provides us with a vast array of expertise and knowledge in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2323.844s">And</a>  I think that this is something that the community development board would be excited to work with us on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2329.165s">So</a>  with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support the measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2332.426s">And,</a>  you know, when we talk about accessories dwellings, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2336.402s">an</a>  apartment above a garage, Mr. President, or a small home in a backyard, you know, with the setbacks and zoning allows for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2344.408s">So</a>  I think that that's, you know, a backyard cottage, something like that, a basement apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2348.391s">But</a>  just the housing options for people, you know, you know, someone who has aging parents, you know, I think that an accessory dwelling unit will be great for someone in my situation where I have a wife, young kids and an aging father who has his independence, but I would like to have him closer to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2363.482s">You</a>  know, so those are just some things that we need to talk about and discuss, especially when we look at the city of Medford, the desire for us all to age in place and the opportunities and options that are out there and the limits that are surrounding them at this point in time, I think make this a good measure to pursue and to take a look at Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2384.026s">So</a>  with that being said, I rest my case and I'll ask my council colleagues to support the endeavor.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2388.467s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2390.308s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2393.894s">second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2394.214s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2395.935s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2397.495s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2398.375s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2399.596s">I'm</a>  right there with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2400.396s">I</a>  think that was an incredible explanation and I think this is something we should do for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2406.318s">So</a>  I'm supportive of this and supportive of deliberating on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2409.339s">I</a>  was wondering if we could add a B paper just to get an update from the solicitor's office on the status of some ordinance we've requested and also whether or not KP Law is helping out with ordinance drafting.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2427.348s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2427.568s">So</a>  the, uh, so the B paper, uh, clerk, do you have the language for the B paper?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2431.452s">Mr.</a>  President in light of, um, in light of the events that have transpired over the past, uh, since January now, eight months, nine months, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2450.769s">the</a>  number of ordinances that we've requested to be drafted and the number of ordinances that have come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2454.972s">I</a>  think it might be worthwhile for us to schedule a committee of the whole with representatives from the solicitor's office and the city solicitor to get an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2463.979s">I</a>  filed the resolution maybe 90 days ago seeking for monthly updates as to where we are in the status of the requested draft ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2471.45s">And</a>  that's something that I think that we should pursue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2474.191s">We</a>  haven't gotten an update on the status of any of our draft ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2477.251s">So</a>  it might make sense for us to call a committee of the whole so we can be brought up to speed as to where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2481.772s">That's</a>  the council work product. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2483.733s">I</a>  certainly support Councilor Behr's resolution, but I think that it might make more sense for us instead of to get a report back, but to actually have a meeting and get all get in the same room where we can talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2493.395s">So</a>  that would be the only request that I make is that he just changed the language in his amendment to require a committee of the whole as opposed to report back from the administration.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2501.848s">I</a>  would support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2502.569s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2505.611s">Clark,</a>  do you have that language?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2508.214s">So</a>  the B paper has been changed rather than an update from the solicitor's office on the status of ordinances requested by the council and whether KP law is helping out with the drafting of the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2521.845s">You</a>  want to committee the whole on that?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2524.567s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2524.908s">I'd</a>  still like an answer on the KP law, but if it comes before or during that meeting, that's fine.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2530.523s">So</a>  if I use your original amendment and say as well, as a committee, the whole meeting, does that suffice for everyone?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2538.928s">That</a>  works. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2539.968s">That's</a>  fine, yep.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2543.09s">Does</a>  that work for you too?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2547.412s">Was</a>  that the Councilor Knight?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2549.293s">That</a>  was the Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2549.934s">It</a>  works for me, absolutely.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2551.535s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2553.156s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2553.756s">So</a>  the B paper offered by Councilor Bears is seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2558.739s">Second,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2559.755s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2561.656s">Okay,</a>  Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2563.597s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2564.277s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2567.439s">I</a>  think what Councilor Knight when he mentioned, he's talking about people like me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2572.322s">My</a>  kids are all moved out of the house and moved away and I got four bedrooms and three bathrooms and me and my wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2581.463s">That's</a>  something, and I know there's many other people like myself, we've got these big houses and we could probably put it in our apartment and it would give us a chance to age in place in the same method where we'd like to stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2597.174s">Without</a>  having to move out and maybe sell the house to maybe one of our family or someone that would.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2611.319s">I</a>  think that we should... I think... I think we're getting... I think that we should... Clerk Herbie, can you mute everyone please? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2621.645s">I'm</a>  trying.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2629.55s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2632.492s">But</a>  again, like I say, I think he's talking about people in my age group who, like I say, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2638.793s">Our</a>  children are all gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2639.754s">We've</a>  got this big house and nobody in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2643.297s">And</a>  I said, you know, probably could do it in our apartment somewhere on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2647.04s">So</a>  I hope, I wholeheartedly support this and look forward to an ordinance coming forward.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2653.865s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2655.106s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2656.526s">Uh,</a>  thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2657.747s">I</a>  want to thank, uh, my colleague Councilor Knight for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2661.209s">Uh,</a>  Councilor Caraviello, I have two kids I can drop off tomorrow, if that's all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2665.933s">Um,</a>  Mr. President, um, you know, for many years in this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2672.723s">We've</a>  had accessory dwelling units, however, they're just not permitted or authorized. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2680.97s">And</a>  those, what I refer to, are illegal basement apartments, illegal attic apartments, and a number of other illegal attachments to homes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2691.658s">And</a>  this has been an issue of contention for a lot of years in neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2696.522s">especially</a>  thickly settled neighborhoods, because you'll see an influx of cars, you'll see an influx of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2705.409s">However,</a>  these particular illegal units currently are not being permitted by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2713.094s">So</a>  there's number one, there's a safety concern with electrical, plumbing, heating, you name it, there's a safety concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2721.2s">And</a>  also taxes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2723.962s">Many</a>  of these illegal apartments that currently exist now don't pay taxes to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2728.987s">So</a>  this discussion is well warranted in the community, and it's something that I agree with. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2734.811s">And</a>  at the very least, we should be looking at in-law apartments, because I agree with my colleagues to allow residents that are at a certain age to stay in their units or their houses, I think makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2750.765s">We</a>  also have to be mindful of the flip side, that once we bring this above board, that we will have an influx into our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2762.117s">And</a>  if you think parking is a concern right now, it's going to become even more of a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2767.223s">And</a>  then we have to look at resident permit parking, potentially citywide permit parking, like they do in Cambridge and Somerville and other surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2776.688s">So</a>  this actually is probably a great issue to bring up because it's going to bring everything that's currently happening, happening illegal in the community above board right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2787.194s">And</a>  we could take a good hard look at how we want to approach this issue, but also be mindful that we don't want our neighborhoods to turn into an area where there's going to be a mass exodus because there are so many units in an area that it becomes unlivable for residents as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2805.925s">So</a>  I think there's a happy median here that we have to find, but the issue definitely needs to be broached. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2813.85s">And</a>  I look forward to having that discussion.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2816.84s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2818.281s">Any</a>  other questions or comments from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2822.804s">Okay,</a>  seeing and hearing none. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2823.805s">Let's</a>  see, anyone from the public we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2828.308s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2833.031s">Kelly</a>  Catalo, name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Catalo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2835.373s">Kelly</a>  Catalo, 46 Otis Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2838.255s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor, President Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2841.677s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2842.895s">Thank</a>  you very, very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2844.936s">For</a>  many, many years, I've seen viable apartments being gutted out of these homes as the family moved out, and they were great living spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2854.221s">They</a>  were affordable for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2856.963s">Councilor</a>  Marks, I know that you have a concern about the cars, and this idea actually came from a fellow realtor in a different state, but what they do in her city is that they only give a certain number of parking permits per house. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2871.07s">So</a>  if that person wanted to be able to rent out their accessible unit, if they had an extra parking permit for that person, then that person could park on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2879.98s">If</a>  not, they wouldn't have a parking space. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2882.362s">I</a>  just think that housing has gotten to the point where it is so expensive right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2887.548s">What</a>  information, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2889.39s">What</a>  information, Councilor Larkins?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2891.492s">Not</a>  to cut you off, Kelly, and I appreciate what you said, but remember that not all streets are permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2898.417s">And</a>  it's great to say we have permits, but that's not the case on many, many streets in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2904.162s">So</a>  in order to implement what you're talking about, we'd have to do some type of permit citywide parking.</p>

    <p>[Catalo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2911.788s">I'm</a>  just asking you to consider working with the parking situation just because the housing situation is that dire right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2919.057s">With</a>  COVID, you know, a lot of the younger generation has all moved home. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2923.563s">They</a>  would love to have an in-law apartment in their mom's house if they still have some independence. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2927.848s">So</a>  there are so many great ideas and so many places that you can go with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2932.01s">And</a>  if you could also consider what the city of Boston has done, they've taken accessory dwelling unit and they've actually called it an additional dwelling unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2940.514s">And</a>  there is some legislation that's online that you can get right off of the city of Boston website. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2945.956s">And</a>  if you would consider that, I think that it would help a lot of people be able to afford to stay in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2952.459s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2952.839s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2955.24s">Any</a>  other questions or comments from the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2958.886s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2960.926s">Yeah,</a>  I think you had your hand up.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2962.127s">I</a>  can see Marianne has her hand up, her virtual hand up.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2966.268s">Okay,</a>  I see right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2967.808s">Okay,</a>  Marianne, I'm trying to unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2972.029s">Hi,</a>  thank you for noticing me.</p>

    <p>[Broxton]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2973.529s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2974.329s">Yes,</a>  name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2976.109s">Marianne</a>  Broxton, 25 Exchange Ave in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2979.51s">I</a>  have a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2980.77s">I</a>  noticed that Councilman Knight said that the creation of these apartments would help, you know, hopefully increase affordable housing in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2991.13s">I</a>  would love if that was true and if that happens, but my fear is that I know that the city of Boston, any new construction, you have to have 10% of the housing units allocated for affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3004.3s">So</a>  if we're having individual apartments pop up all around the city, what does that guarantee that actually some of them will be allocated for affordable housing? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3014.627s">I</a>  was looking at real estate, I got a thing that popped up on my Twitter the other day, for an apartment near Tufts that was a five bedroom apartment that was $5,000, you know, which would be great for college students each moving in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3029.338s">But</a>  if we're saying, look, what's to prevent like somebody in that area to say, okay, well, I have a garage, let me do it over. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3035.283s">Now</a>  I can charge like 2,000, 3,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3036.804s">That</a>  doesn't necessarily allocate more affordable housing for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3042.302s">It</a>  might be great for people that want to have like a mother-in-law apartment or something like that, or maybe a little starter home if their adult children are getting married and they want to set them up in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3052.504s">And</a>  I also have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3053.524s">I</a>  noticed that you mentioned something about the idea of some apartments that don't have, aren't required to have refrigerator and stoves in them, in these types of apartments that it could just be like the bedroom and the bathroom or whatever.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3066.348s">Um,</a>  no, no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3068.348s">I</a>  said that there was a restricted covenant on prior prior permitting of these was allowed through a restrictive covenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3074.509s">And</a>  when the property changed hands, the kitchen would have to be taken out.</p>

    <p>[Broxton]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3079.01s">Okay,</a>  because that's what I'm also curious about, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3080.731s">Because</a>  I know in Massachusetts, when you rent an apartment, though, it does not have to have a refrigerator, but it is required by law to have a stove in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3087.812s">So</a>  I was wondering how, how does that play into if we're saying, yes, this is this is something that we want to have more affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3095.331s">but</a>  then it actually never ends up producing more affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3098.795s">And</a>  then if people can say, well, we don't really have to follow those guidelines.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3102.4s">Well,</a>  I mean, the basic economic principle of supply and demand would drive the housing costs down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3109.462s">So,</a>  you know, it may not be an affordable housing unit per se by the definition of, you know, an affordable housing unit under Department of Housing and Community Development guidelines, but what it would do is make housing more affordable because our stock would increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3123.307s">So</a>  if the supply exceeds the demand, the cost goes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3127.089s">If</a>  the demand exceeds the supply, the cost goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3129.27s">So</a>  just the basic economic principle of supply and demand, the more housing units we have on the market, the cheaper that those units are going to be.</p>

    <p>[Broxton]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3136.225s">I</a>  appreciate that idea, but I really think it has to do with the amount of income for people also, maybe alongside supply and demand, because when we consider how many homeless families are in Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3148.39s">The</a>  principle of the accessory use dwelling unit is it's usually a single-family owner-occupied home, right, defined by Massachusetts General Law, a single-family owner-occupied home. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3162.409s">So</a>  it's not, you know, this isn't something where it's going to be, you know, I'm just throwing apartments up all over the place so tough kids can live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3168.59s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3169.25s">This</a>  is to meet a need and a demand in the community.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3172.011s">Okay,</a>  thank you for your clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3175.332s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3178.052s">Okay,</a>  any other questions or comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3187.654s">Let's</a>  see, we got Jennifer Kerwood. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3191.075s">I'm</a>  going to try to unmute you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3194.795s">Hi,</a>  Jennifer Kerwood, 43 Willis Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3198.345s">I</a>  guess my question would be, or I guess suggestions, would be making sure we know how we feel about Airbnbs while considering these sorts of ADUs. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3210.373s">I</a>  know that there are several cities where things like that would come into place and then it doesn't actually provide housing, it's really just meant for the person to have an auxiliary income. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3220.299s">And</a>  I have no objection to that necessarily, but if the actual rationale behind this is <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3227.82s">to</a>  provide housing, it would have to be a consideration, what we would do for like VRBOs and Airbnb and things like that.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3234.226s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3238.33s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3241.153s">Okay,</a>  we have, is it Will Laverre? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3249.559s">Hi</a>  there.</p>

    <p>[Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3252.041s">William</a>  Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3256.345s">I</a>  think this is a really great thing, accessory dwelling units. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3260.127s">I</a>  think that we have issues with affordability, not only in terms of the formal notion of affordability, of the technical definition of the department of housing and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3272.319s">But</a>  we have the issue that a very small number of people get to live in good locations like Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3278.385s">Most</a>  Americans have to have a very long commute to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3280.907s">They</a>  don't have any access to trains or buses or all the wonderful things we enjoy here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3286.372s">And</a>  I think it'd be really great if some of those people, maybe they're commuting from New Hampshire or North Andover or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3295.601s">and</a>  they'd have to catch a train that comes only once every three hours, they can start move to Medford, it'll help our traffic prices, we have more people living, paying taxes in Medford, rather than commuting far-flung locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3308.398s">And</a>  when fewer people are pushed out to those far-flung locations, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3312.927s">People</a>  won't be as desperate to pay so much money live here and that's gonna be a slow process supply and demand It's not it is supply and demand and getting a little bit more complex to that But basically the idea is that if you're having to force people really far away They're gonna give an arm and a leg to avoid that they have lots of options. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3331.481s">It's</a>  gonna be a little bit better It'll slowly get better Accessory dwell you and it's good first step to help that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3337.685s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3338.666s">Thank</a>  you See we have a <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3342.735s">Veronica</a>  Hernandez, name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3345.961s">I'm</a>  trying to unmute you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3389.345s">This</a>  is in no way, shape, or form was a proposal to have these as inclusionary zoning housing units. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3398.171s">It</a>  was just to allow for <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3400.525s">The</a>  ability to permit for an accessory unit to create more housing stock in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3406.567s">And</a>  when I think we're all getting hung up on this affordable affordable affordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3411.008s">This</a>  isn't the proposal that's going to be required to be affordable housing, the affordability is going to lie in the supply and demand with the increase in supply. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3420.276s">we're</a>  gonna be able to drive the cost of housing down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3423.261s">That's</a>  where the affordability comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3425.004s">Making</a>  it more affordable would probably be the best way to put it, but not affordable housing, making housing more affordable, as opposed to increasing our affordable housing stock. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3433.988s">These</a>  accessory dwelling units in the stock that's going to come with them are not going to be attributable to our 10% threshold under the Department of Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3442.211s">So</a>  I want that to be very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3444.572s">The</a>  affordability aspect comes into it by increasing the number of units in your community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3451.115s">We're</a>  going to hopefully catch up and then at some point meet or exceed our demand so that this cost will continue to drive down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3459.851s">So</a>  I don't want us to get hung up on this affordable housing, affordable housing, like it's something that's gonna go towards a safe habit threshold, because that's not the intention of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3469.218s">The</a>  intention of this is to allow people the opportunity to pursue an ability to create in-law apartments and owner-occupied dwellings that are single-family. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3479.106s">So</a>  that's where this is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3480.187s">I</a>  want that to be very clear.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3481.908s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Haynes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3483.49s">Veronica,</a>  please continue.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3487.417s">No,</a>  I'm all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3488.698s">He</a>  said what he said. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3489.839s">It's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3490.42s">We're</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3491.3s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3492.221s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3492.642s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3499.507s">Gina</a>  Doe, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3505.312s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3506.333s">Yes,</a>  we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3507.414s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3508.095s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3508.695s">I</a>  apologize for not having video. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3510.417s">My</a>  signal doesn't do so well with video. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3513.059s">Thanks</a>  for the opportunity to speak on this important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3516.726s">I</a>  think there's some confusion on what ADU units are and what they're supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3524.329s">Accessory</a>  dwelling units are historically spaces that are created to allow for additional living, typically of related members. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3539.636s">So</a>  in other words, an in-law apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3542.767s">above</a>  a garage for your college student to have a place to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3546.829s">They're</a>  not meant to be rental or condo stock. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3554.552s">And</a>  that's important because we talk about housing and affordability and affordable housing interchangeably, but it's really not. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3567.458s">The</a>  supply and demand curve does not inflect in housing <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3572.762s">because</a>  housing isn't a consumable like a widget or a bag of sugar. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3579.504s">And</a>  we really need to stop conflating housing affordability with affordable housing government quota that is required by 40B for the state of Massachusetts and what housing stock does in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3599.668s">So</a>  while <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3602.431s">These</a>  AHUs have a place in our community to help maintain places for people to be without being displaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3612.899s">They</a>  will in no way, shape or form do anything to increase affordable housing, quote, units that are required as subsidized housing units are, because they're never built with those subsidy funds because they're usually <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3631.7s">put</a>  into existing structures, whether it be a basement, an attic, a front room, above a garage, you're not building them separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3641.044s">That's</a>  the first point I'd like to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3643.185s">And</a>  then the second point is this is just another layer of death by paper cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3650.627s">We</a>  are currently seeing an influx of housing that's high value housing when we take a parcel and it's cut <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3660.079s">and</a>  subdivided, and we get two or four luxury units that are high-end units that do nothing to offset and increase our threshold of income so that our affordable housing threshold rises with it, which further puts housing affordability out of reach for many Medford residents because <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3685.972s">at</a>  least 40% of Medford residents do not meet that $75,000 a year threshold that we typically see with affordable housing requirements and in affordable housing lotteries. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3702.844s">So</a>  therefore, while I think this is a commendable thing to be looking at, I would caution that we need to be very precise about what we're doing and how we're doing it in the language <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3715.983s">and</a>  that we're sticking to accessory dwelling units for the purpose that's intended. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3721.906s">Because</a>  otherwise what we're doing is we're creating yet another loophole for quote developers and flippers to come in and up zone through this new ordinance that we're looking to create. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3738.334s">So</a>  I would caution people and I would encourage our population to think about housing affordability <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3746.18s">slightly</a>  separate from affordable housing, which is the government mandated portions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3751.723s">So</a>  I thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3752.923s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3753.924s">May</a>  I remind everyone, I apologize, I should have said this from the beginning, my fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3758.986s">Minute</a>  and a half, you get a minute and a half when you're called upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3762.448s">So</a>  if I may, so Kelly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3765.189s">Appreciate</a>  the latitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3767.49s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3767.89s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3770.572s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3772.113s">Mr.</a>  President, I think we've gotten a little bit off track on <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3775.524s">what</a>  Councilor Neal brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3778.145s">Again,</a>  I don't think he was bringing it up as an affordable housing alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3782.266s">It</a>  was just something that he asked maybe we could look into and maybe have a discussion on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3788.327s">I</a>  don't think he brought it up with the point of making them affordable units that would add to our affordable staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3795.149s">So</a>  I want to make that point, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3797.409s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Cabral. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3800.91s">Kelly</a>  Catala, did you have a comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3802.971s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3804.051s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3805.971s">name</a>  and address.</p>

    <p>[Catalo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3807.772s">Kelly</a>  Catalo, 46 Otis Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3811.293s">To</a>  follow up what Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3812.794s">Caraviello</a>  just said and what Mr. Knight said, first of all, Massachusetts state law does allow a owner-occupant to rent up to three unrelated people by the second degree of kindred in their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3825.998s">So</a>  there are <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3827.759s">access</a>  for apartments right now in the city of Medford that a little old lady lives upstairs and she can't afford to pay her taxes and maybe a college student or a young adult is renting her apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3839.188s">She</a>  is still within the guidelines of the state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3842.79s">and</a>  she's able to pay her tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3845.272s">That</a>  young person who's living in that apartment is only paying $600. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3848.335s">That</a>  is housing stock that we all need. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3852.759s">We</a>  need for the people in our community to be able to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3856.803s">Most</a>  of the people in our community are not the people that are going to qualify or even go after <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3863.409s">you</a>  know, some of this housing subsidy stuff that people are talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3867.492s">And</a>  I really don't feel that Adam Knight was looking to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3871.375s">He's</a>  looking to make Medford affordable to the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3875.618s">And</a>  I really hope that everybody can get on board with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3878.64s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4169.313s">I</a>  just wanted to say that I'm glad to see the school portion of my motion is on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4175.077s">Glad</a>  that Director Denley Benjamin is here to answer questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4179.14s">And</a>  that leaves the only unresolved question as to what's gonna happen with the local aid funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4184.444s">So</a>  that's now my main question with this motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4187.986s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4189.607s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4193.39s">Move</a>  the paper, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4195.363s">approval</a>  on the motion of vice president caviello's second of i that's what bears consulate night uh mr president we could just have an explanation from somebody in the administration as to where these funds are going to go when they are re-injected into our school department's budget i'd appreciate that um i know that you know <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4217.747s">When</a>  we were going through the budget process, there were a number of decisions that were not filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4222.808s">There</a>  was the hope that we would be going to be able to recall, I think another 30 or 40 employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4227.529s">So</a>  I think an update would be worthwhile and sufficient at this point in time as to how these funds are going to be expended in the spirit of Council of Business Resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4235.71s">I</a>  know we have some representatives from the administration here, as well as some representatives from the teachers union that are here this evening as well.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4242.471s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4243.551s">Alicia</a>  or Dave Rodriguez, do either of you have <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4248.007s">you'd</a>  be able to answer those questions?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4250.669s">Good</a>  evening, Honorable Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4251.95s">So</a>  the school budget is a bottom line budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4255.113s">So</a>  when you voted, it's not like the city where it's byline. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4258.515s">So</a>  the school would actually have to tell you how they're going to use that million dollars that was level funded.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4264.5s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4270.765s">So</a>  is it safe to say at this point in time that the school committee is waiting for us to give them their money so that they can figure out how they want to spend it?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4277.884s">That</a>  would be correct.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4279.525s">Sounds</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4280.245s">More</a>  for approval, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4281.845s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4282.726s">Scarpelli.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4284.166s">If</a>  we could if we can ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4285.907s">As</a>  soon as this happens, if we could amend this paper, and ask the school committee superintendent to please. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4295.59s">I'll</a>  be a little clearer with our administrators, our teachers, our students, and our parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4303.56s">I</a>  think that there's so much going on with COVID and, you know, starting a school and what's been happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4311.37s">Parents</a>  not sure who the teachers are going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4313.451s">You</a>  have administrators that don't know who's going into different classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4317.852s">So</a>  if we can have an update sent to all the parties as quickly as possible to eliminate at least that fear and that unease in our kids and our parents and our teachers and administrators, I think it'd be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4334.978s">So</a>  thank you for bringing this forward.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4339.342s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4340.843s">Clerk</a>  Hurtubise, do you have that amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4342.083s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4342.723s">Do</a>  you want me to read it back? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4345.104s">You</a>  can, yeah, sure.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4347.685s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli's amendment was to ask the school committee and the superintendent to be clearer with the administrators, teachers, students, and parents, and update all parties as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4359.502s">Do</a>  you need a little, do you need to add a little more to that Councilor Scarpelli?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4362.705s">Just</a>  on teacher reassignments and dealing with the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4368.871s">I</a>  think that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4370.492s">So</a>  if we can do that, that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4372.374s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4617.59s">So</a>  there were, I'll start with this paper with some bond proceeds that were done and some MSBA money where they spent all the MSBA and they still had some bond proceeds left in the project that was never spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4632.373s">So</a>  this money can be reprogrammed to the high school for a high school improvement projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4638.594s">As</a>  long as whatever projects they're doing is for the same amount of time that the loan would have been for the science labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4648.405s">And</a>  I know that the high school, some of the things that they were looking at were HVAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4652.348s">I</a>  know that they're looking at, I know I've heard the council too, bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4657.412s">So</a>  there's a lot of projects that they have that improvements that need to go at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4661.916s">And</a>  then set up those bond proceeds just sitting there stagnant in the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4665.859s">If</a>  you program them to a new project, they can use those now.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4672.124s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello, are you all set or? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4674.526s">No,</a>  I'm a little confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4677.237s">Why</a>  we're taking the money that was appropriated for the science labs? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4680.738s">And</a>  I mean, I know we need improvements, but why is that allowed to take money that was allocated for a science lab to put it somewhere else?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4690.119s">Because</a>  the project was completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4691.7s">The</a>  project was completed for the science lab and that surplus funding that was left.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4700.201s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4702.222s">Can</a>  I ask why there was surplus funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4704.473s">Did</a>  we do the job? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4705.313s">Did</a>  we did it get completed on the budget?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4707.794s">I'm</a>  assuming it was under budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4709.395s">So</a>  I know whenever I've seen surplus funds, it's usually because you have to borrow for the total of what your estimated project is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4716.197s">And</a>  then when you're actually doing the work, it usually does come under and you may have a little bit of proceeds left in this case, there was 703,000 left.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4722.719s">It's</a>  a little bit more than a little bit, but yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4730.262s">I</a>  guess if it goes along by long as it goes along with the law, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4736.158s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4737.539s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4738.8s">We</a>  have Councilor Morell, then Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4740.542s">Councilor</a>  Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4741.643s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4742.564s">Alicia,</a>  you said that the project can be a similar project or however you word it, can be done as long as it's the same amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4748.749s">What's</a>  that timeframe? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4750.991s">30</a>  years.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4751.932s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4752.953s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4755.995s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4756.936s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4761.36s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4763.095s">Um,</a>  so we have two papers before us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4765.516s">The</a>  one that we're speaking of right now is for the $703,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4767.357s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4767.718s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4768.338s">So</a>  that is what would have been the savings on the science lab projects through our, um, uh, bond or a bond dissipation notes or whatever it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4778.683s">However,</a>  we were able to save money on that project.</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4781.105s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4782.033s">And</a>  now what we're doing is we're gonna take that $703,000 and because we had appropriated that previously for school department capital improvements, we're going to repurpose these for continued school department capital improvements?</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4795.44s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4795.86s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4796.52s">And</a>  then of this $703,000, 112,000 of that is going to be directed towards the HEAC improvements? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4800.162s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4800.282s">Or</a>  is that above and beyond?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4809.204s">That</a>  112, which is the next paper, will be for HVAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4813.907s">And</a>  we put it in for, it was HVAC and boiler replacement, those surplus proceeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4818.63s">So</a>  we wanna put it back into this high school improvements project and work on some of the HVAC.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4827.875s">Okay,</a>  so what was the total surplus? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4832.197s">Was</a>  it?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4833.358s">So</a>  703, 489.80 was in the science labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4834.518s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4838.137s">And</a>  112, 692, 73 was the surplus in the HVAC boiler replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4843.978s">I</a>  just wanted to combine them all into one high school improvements project for the school committee to make those choices of where it's best serves the schools.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4855.161s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4855.781s">So</a>  now when we're looking at the money that's come in over the past couple of weeks, we have about $1.9 million in funds that have been injected into our unrestricted government and chapter 70 money.</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4868.587s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4869.427s">And</a>  we had a $5.5 million deficit right around January 30th, June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4874.97s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4875.65s">That</a>  brings us to about $3.6 million in deficit, restructural deficit right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4881.033s">Then</a>  we have these two papers that's about another million dollars that we're going to be able to invest it back into our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4886.135s">So</a>  we're looking at having a deficit of about $2.6 million as of right now, compared to where we were June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4892.998s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4893.778s">We've</a>  almost cut the deficit in half over the past 45 days.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4898.425s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4899.065s">Excellent.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4900.967s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4901.527s">I</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4902.567s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4904.028s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4905.829s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4906.85s">So,</a>  correct me if I'm wrong, Alicia, but could this money be allocated for any adjustments that are needed for getting the buildings prepared for COVID? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4921.279s">Is</a>  that, you know, to get our kids back into the schools?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4926.252s">We</a>  would use for that, we have CARES Act funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4928.973s">The</a>  schools have CARES Act and ESSER money. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4931.013s">The</a>  schools have a preparedness grant for preparing for the schools to go back, for the kids to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4937.475s">This</a>  one would be more for large capital items.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4940.315s">So-</a>  Bathrooms, stuff like that.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4942.996s">Or</a>  the school needed to do their HVAC, the school needed to do their windows, the school needed to redo their entire bathroom, something to that effect.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4952.34s">Okay,</a>  so Mike, and that's what I was coming to. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4954.5s">I</a>  know that part of the issue that I've heard was that the HVAC system had to be updated at the high school to make sure it's safe for our students and teachers to return. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4967.903s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4968.523s">So</a>  is it, is that- They could use it for that.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4971.524s">They</a>  could use it for the updating of an HVAC system. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4974.124s">They</a>  could use it for that as well.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4975.144s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4976.264s">Do</a>  you know if that's something they're looking at, do you know, or is that, you don't know?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4980.531s">That</a>  I don't know I mean you'd have to reprogram this first and then let the school committee make the decision of how they're going to keep the funds.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4987.194s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4989.715s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4991.055s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5006.59s">I</a>  just want to touch upon what Councilor Scott probably mentioned regarding the ventilation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5011.576s">Alicia,</a>  do you know if we're looking at ventilation upgrades to all the schools throughout the system?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5017.642s">I</a>  know the schools are looking at that.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5020.353s">Okay,</a>  the reason why I ask is that during the budget, the school committee came out with a laundry list of priorities and recommendations if they had additional money. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5034.117s">Have</a>  they put anything in priority for this additional funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5038.539s">I</a>  mean, they're well, we haven't approved it, but they're well aware there's money out there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5044.681s">Have</a>  they put anything in writing to what they're looking at?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5048.459s">I</a>  haven't seen anything and I can't speak on behalf of the school committee.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5053.021s">Right,</a>  but we're being asked to appropriate money.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5056.162s">Right</a>  for them to make the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5058.302s">Right,</a>  so you appropriate and they have a fund and it's awarded I can create an account for them and then they can figure out, they're going to expend the money.</p>
