28
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:49,049
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

29
00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:58,498
[SPEAKER_12]: How's that?

30
00:02:58,878 --> 00:02:59,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Good.

31
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

32
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:04,928
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, members.

33
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,355
[SPEAKER_12]: First, I want to thank my

34
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:21,225
[SPEAKER_12]: colleagues at central office and the administrators who all had a hand in helping to get this proposal together for you tonight.

35
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:34,552
[SPEAKER_12]: As many of you know through our subcommittee meetings, this is kind of the perfect storm of salary demands and federal funding expiring.

36
00:03:36,273 --> 00:03:42,919
[SPEAKER_12]: undefunded accounts, just all converging in FY 25.

37
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,263
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll begin the presentation.

38
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:56,112
[SPEAKER_34]: I just would like to note that both of the student reps are actually here.

39
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:57,393
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, thank you.

40
00:04:07,731 --> 00:04:20,173
[SPEAKER_12]: The first thing we look at before we even start looking at numbers is what the enrollment might look like for next year and trying to make some predictions around that.

41
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:28,391
[SPEAKER_12]: What we see is continued growth in lower grades, and that's been a recent phenomenon.

42
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:38,317
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have this small first grade moving into grade two, and that's gonna put less of a teaching demand on that grade level.

43
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:40,998
[SPEAKER_12]: And you'll see we're taking some,

44
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,491
[SPEAKER_12]: savings opportunities there.

45
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:50,694
[SPEAKER_12]: But there were other cases of low class sizes, but there were also needs.

46
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:55,856
[SPEAKER_12]: We have positions being added to manage class size as well.

47
00:04:57,277 --> 00:05:00,198
[SPEAKER_12]: Kindergarten growth is another area that we're monitoring.

48
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:10,383
[SPEAKER_12]: We did not continue with the kindergarten teachers that we added at the beginning of the year.

49
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:18,668
[SPEAKER_12]: We are predicting that we'll have a kindergarten enrollment very similar to what we had this year.

50
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:29,533
[SPEAKER_12]: So we think the prior staffing should be sufficient for that, but we will have to make adjustments if that happens.

51
00:05:30,754 --> 00:05:33,836
[SPEAKER_12]: if our predictions are a little short.

52
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:44,085
[SPEAKER_12]: There are some indications that the kindergarten registration is a little bit higher right now at this point in the year than it has been in past years.

53
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:50,430
[SPEAKER_12]: And we continue to see some declines in enrollment at middle and high school.

54
00:05:54,893 --> 00:05:59,377
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is just kind of a focus on the elementary grades.

55
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:07,039
[SPEAKER_12]: you can see grade one, grade three, you know, sharp increases compared to grade four and grade five.

56
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:15,261
[SPEAKER_12]: And these larger increases will kind of continue into grade four next year and eventually grade five.

57
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:22,583
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we have that kind of outlier grade two, you know, in the middle of all that, but actually that,

58
00:06:23,476 --> 00:06:29,238
[SPEAKER_12]: That grade two is gonna kind of help manage the total school enrollment.

59
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:35,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Things are pretty tight at some of these schools, particularly the Roberts.

60
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Then the next slide.

61
00:06:51,564 --> 00:06:59,390
[SPEAKER_12]: This should be one before that Peter is just this looks at the district as a whole, you know total

62
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:20,846
[SPEAKER_12]: We see our enrollment predicted to go up by a net of 14 students, but we see kind of lower growth, or we see declines, as we mentioned, in the middle and high school grades, and then we see that 60 student increase in the elementary grades.

63
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:25,008
[SPEAKER_12]: This is,

64
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:31,885
[SPEAKER_12]: a graph on kind of the history of budget increases.

65
00:07:33,006 --> 00:07:36,309
[SPEAKER_12]: And those taken from the FY 24 budget book.

66
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:46,198
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can see it's kind of peaks and valleys that on average, you know, you have these kind of two outlier years.

67
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,121
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's 22 and 23.

68
00:07:52,603 --> 00:07:58,526
[SPEAKER_12]: If you take those out, the average increase has been about three and a half percent.

69
00:08:02,427 --> 00:08:16,012
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the other thing we wanna look at is the trends on how our salary budgets are increasing versus our non-salary budgets, which is the next slide.

70
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:20,254
[SPEAKER_12]: So on this slide,

71
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:26,267
[SPEAKER_12]: the percentages you could see are kind of growing.

72
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:37,660
[SPEAKER_12]: The salary budgets are consuming more of the budgets, you know, from at one point around 80, 20, and then it gets up to 84, 83.

73
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:51,645
[SPEAKER_12]: Our proposal will adjust those differences back down closer to 80-20.

74
00:08:53,487 --> 00:09:05,056
[SPEAKER_12]: But what it indicates is that the additional resources that are available in the budget year in, year out, are not sufficient to meet the salary.

75
00:09:05,116 --> 00:09:06,617
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's been a combination of

76
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:16,566
[SPEAKER_12]: new appropriations coming in, but some of that salary is being funded by the non-salary lines as they began to shrink.

77
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:30,096
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's just something to keep in mind that you wanna keep balance there and salaries are always gonna be the majority of our budget, but it can consume the entire budget, obviously.

78
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:40,913
[SPEAKER_12]: So the first group of slides is we're gonna see where are the major areas that our budget's increasing.

79
00:09:41,974 --> 00:09:55,280
[SPEAKER_12]: And this year to fund our collective bargaining commitments, we are increasing salary lines by a little over $3.3 million.

80
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:01,583
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we have a few contracts that will be expiring this year.

81
00:10:02,991 --> 00:10:06,534
[SPEAKER_12]: as well as non-unit staff who go year to year.

82
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:24,887
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we're increasing our undistributed salaries budget by over $600,000 to provide some funds for those contracts and non-unit salaries.

83
00:10:26,088 --> 00:10:28,129
[SPEAKER_12]: In the Medford budget is,

84
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:38,865
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, $500,000 in non-distributed, which is meant to be maybe a contingency.

85
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:44,890
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, you know, about a half a percent of the budget.

86
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:47,712
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're maintaining that.

87
00:10:49,824 --> 00:10:56,829
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's important to have a contingency in your budget because there'll be unforeseen expenses that will come up.

88
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:06,076
[SPEAKER_12]: For instance, if our kindergarten enrollment is higher than we predicted, we have funds where we can add some more teachers if needed.

89
00:11:06,937 --> 00:11:18,446
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to be fully transparent that we have, in addition to the 665, we have a half a million dollars in undistributed.

90
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:21,116
[SPEAKER_12]: which we had this year as well.

91
00:11:23,937 --> 00:11:38,562
[SPEAKER_12]: So the next category are these accounts that we've been talking about in subcommittee that have been underfunded for two or three years that we're seeking to correct in FY25.

92
00:11:39,182 --> 00:11:44,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Homeless transportation being the big one, we budget 130,000 and we spend closer to five or 600,000 every year.

93
00:11:50,754 --> 00:11:56,938
[SPEAKER_12]: And then substitute coverage, special eds, extended school year.

94
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:09,406
[SPEAKER_12]: A number of our students on IEPs get programming for the year round, and so they have a summer program that's part of their IEP.

95
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:11,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Legal expenses.

96
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,215
[SPEAKER_12]: has been underfunded as well.

97
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:22,578
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, buildings and grounds is very underfunded.

98
00:12:22,798 --> 00:12:31,642
[SPEAKER_12]: And the copy of leases, there's sufficient money for the actual lease itself, which has some copies built in.

99
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:37,284
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you go over the set amount of copies in your contract,

100
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:47,148
[SPEAKER_12]: that prediction was a little bit low, so this kind of rightsizes that contract.

101
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:52,489
[SPEAKER_12]: So these are to bring those accounts up to what the historical spending has been.

102
00:12:53,810 --> 00:13:02,872
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we have two special revenue funds that are

103
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:08,900
[SPEAKER_12]: no longer sufficient to support the staff that we've assigned to them.

104
00:13:11,402 --> 00:13:26,309
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we are proposing to add $1.1 million to cover positions that are currently funded in the ESSA grant that's expiring this fiscal year.

105
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,370
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I've

106
00:13:30,031 --> 00:13:35,177
[SPEAKER_12]: We have 23 paraprofessionals that are funded on buildings and grounds revolving fund.

107
00:13:35,937 --> 00:13:38,780
[SPEAKER_12]: And this was done in FY 24 as kind of a bridge to get the

108
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:49,804
[SPEAKER_12]: paraprofessionals contract settled, but I don't think it was meant to be something permanent.

109
00:13:50,685 --> 00:13:55,047
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really unsustainable if it was supposed to be permanent.

110
00:13:55,087 --> 00:14:06,894
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm proposing that over the next few years, we provide enough money to kind of unwind that and get those 23 paraprofessionals back into the general fund.

111
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:16,373
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that will cost a little over $1.2 million to the budget.

112
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:27,042
[SPEAKER_12]: So we had 30.8 FTEs funded on ESSA.

113
00:14:27,563 --> 00:14:37,931
[SPEAKER_12]: We're proposing to carry over 20.2 of those FTEs and the professional development funds that were also charged to ESSA.

114
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:44,975
[SPEAKER_12]: very small amount in the general fund budget for professional development right now.

115
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:59,900
[SPEAKER_12]: And as I said, that would cost the budget a little over $1.1 million from ESSER, and then there's 10.6 positions that we will discontinue at the end of this year.

116
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:08,507
[SPEAKER_12]: And so what are these positions that are in ESSA?

117
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:10,608
[SPEAKER_12]: There's an Adjustment Counselor at the Brooks.

118
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:32,656
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a number of positions dedicated to the Newcomers Program at the Mississauga and McGlynn, an Adjustment Counselor and Literacy Interventionist at the Roberts, a Power Behavior Specialist at the Andrews, two security monitors for the high school, academic leads,

119
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:47,888
[SPEAKER_12]: at the high school, as well as instructional support staff, which are basically building substitutes, and one per school.

120
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,692
[SPEAKER_12]: We're retaining of the 2.6,

121
00:15:53,444 --> 00:16:08,130
[SPEAKER_12]: re-engagement specialists we have, we're gonna retain one who will also take on some attendance officer duties that we're bound to implement.

122
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:18,114
[SPEAKER_12]: The grant manager for the business office, the director for the CCSR program and the professional development that I talked about.

123
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:43,506
[SPEAKER_12]: And so for the positions that we're not carrying over, we had four literacy coaches that are currently vacant, the Director for Data and Reporting, 1.6 re-engagement specialists, three para-behavior specialists, and a nurse floater position that was on ESSER and was vacant as well.

124
00:16:48,857 --> 00:16:55,506
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have some new spending to propose totaling a little over $1.7 million.

125
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:56,508
[SPEAKER_12]: The first is special education.

126
00:17:02,492 --> 00:17:10,241
[SPEAKER_12]: rate increases issued by the state this year to be effective in FY 25 for all outplacement tuition programs.

127
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:12,945
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's at 4.69% and is requiring us to add $224,000 to the budget.

128
00:17:13,045 --> 00:17:15,908
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was also just kind of a natural

129
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:33,305
[SPEAKER_12]: Growth in placements, I think the district does a pretty good job of providing a lot of in-district programming for our special needs students, but some students do require an L placement.

130
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:50,634
[SPEAKER_12]: But what's likely in this $239,000 is sometimes students might be placed in kind of a least restrictive setting, and it might not be sufficient, and they have to go into a different program that costs more money.

131
00:17:53,154 --> 00:18:03,020
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we're asking to add another $100,000 to our net work contracted services account.

132
00:18:04,942 --> 00:18:07,343
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the current $100,000.

133
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:13,398
[SPEAKER_12]: the current budget for this, for the whole district is $30,000.

134
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:21,943
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's severely underfunded and it probably should have went into the account fix group.

135
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:34,529
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyway, we also need to look at refreshing some of our student and teacher computer equipment.

136
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,391
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're proposing that

137
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:58,090
[SPEAKER_12]: 20% of our Apple devices, which are primarily for teachers, be refreshed this year, and then begin implementation of a five-year total refresher of that inventory.

138
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,032
[SPEAKER_12]: These computers were bought with COVID funds.

139
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,173
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody had a scramble.

140
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:06,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody had to go on remote.

141
00:19:07,075 --> 00:19:08,035
[SPEAKER_12]: Computers were bought.

142
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:22,627
[SPEAKER_12]: So what's gonna be tricky is down the line trying to maintain this five-year rollout as these computers that were all bought in the same year are aging out.

143
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:29,250
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is probably good for this year, but then we might have to tweak it a little as we go forward.

144
00:19:29,891 --> 00:19:39,156
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the Chromebooks part of this funding is we'd like to buy,

145
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:47,999
[SPEAKER_12]: tablets for kindergartners that are incoming first grades, and then they have that tablet through elementary.

146
00:19:49,961 --> 00:20:03,014
[SPEAKER_12]: Chromebooks for fifth graders that are incoming into sixth grade, and then they have those Chromebooks for their middle school, and then Chromebooks for the eighth graders going into ninth grade, and then they have those for their

147
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,861
[SPEAKER_12]: four years in high school.

148
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:15,988
[SPEAKER_12]: So these funds will allow us to buy, it's about 950 devices to make that plan work.

149
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:32,559
[SPEAKER_12]: The district does a good job of trying to refurbish and refresh, but as you can imagine, those computers take a beating, and four years is probably the extent of their life on that.

150
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:53,297
[SPEAKER_12]: We're also proposing to, outside of the repair, budget fix, which was on the previous slide, is to add money to contract services so we can begin to do some planning for the future and to purchase services to do project management on some of our projects.

151
00:20:55,139 --> 00:20:55,559
[SPEAKER_12]: What would...

152
00:20:57,283 --> 00:21:12,828
[SPEAKER_12]: What I'd like to accomplish with some of this money is to do a space utilization analysis of the, at least the elementaries and maybe the middle, if we had enough money, just to see how many classrooms we have.

153
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,869
[SPEAKER_12]: Are the classrooms actually being used for classrooms?

154
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:17,830
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there,

155
00:21:20,595 --> 00:21:24,539
[SPEAKER_12]: programs or are they being used for office space?

156
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:31,446
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we look at other ways to provide that space and kind of return more classroom to the building?

157
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:35,930
[SPEAKER_12]: So anyways, that type of analysis would allow us to take a look at that.

158
00:21:37,892 --> 00:21:41,876
[SPEAKER_12]: The city also, we had funds in here for,

159
00:21:43,516 --> 00:21:57,101
[SPEAKER_12]: doing a recommissioning effort for our K-8 schools and the mayor has agreed that she will provide some city capital funds to be able to do that.

160
00:21:59,474 --> 00:22:04,738
[SPEAKER_12]: With those funds, we're hoping to do that type of recommissioning for all schools.

161
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:12,364
[SPEAKER_12]: I only had one school in the budget because that's all the bandwidth I thought we could utilize in FY25.

162
00:22:12,384 --> 00:22:14,345
[SPEAKER_12]: But that number was 150, it's now 120,000.

163
00:22:22,588 --> 00:22:28,349
[SPEAKER_12]: The night cleaners at the high school and the McGlynn Middle are under a contract.

164
00:22:29,229 --> 00:22:37,451
[SPEAKER_12]: And on January 1st, there was a scheduled rate increase for the hourly workers on that contract.

165
00:22:38,031 --> 00:22:43,132
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this request of $74,000 annualizes that rate increase into FY25.

166
00:22:43,192 --> 00:22:44,433
[SPEAKER_12]: We're also recommending

167
00:22:51,032 --> 00:22:54,755
[SPEAKER_12]: putting two more yellow buses on the bus route.

168
00:22:54,775 --> 00:23:04,683
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a lot of, when I first got here in August, there was a lot of concern about overcrowding on the buses.

169
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:07,546
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this would go to address that.

170
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:18,735
[SPEAKER_12]: The Medford High School is under their accreditation process, which they go through every several years or so.

171
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:33,304
[SPEAKER_12]: They need $30,000 and they have to put up an outside team that comes in to actually conduct the evaluation.

172
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:41,530
[SPEAKER_12]: There are teacher teams put together to look at, to respond to questions at that accreditation team.

173
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,151
[SPEAKER_12]: wants to have answers to.

174
00:23:45,332 --> 00:23:52,697
[SPEAKER_12]: They currently have a budget of 6,000 kind of for pre-planning work this year, and so this will get that budget up to 30,000.

175
00:23:53,418 --> 00:23:58,101
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I'm also recommending we increase the school supply account.

176
00:23:59,662 --> 00:24:08,788
[SPEAKER_12]: I came up with a formula for the principal's offices that allocates money based on the

177
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:12,845
[SPEAKER_12]: allocations that are provided for in the foundation budget.

178
00:24:13,025 --> 00:24:23,789
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not very generous by any stretch, but it does provide them the money for those principal's offices.

179
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:31,092
[SPEAKER_12]: The high school principal has a budget of $10,000 for office supplies and other expenses.

180
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:42,013
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have a lot of supply budgets kind of filtered out into the various curriculum areas.

181
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:56,697
[SPEAKER_12]: So those really have to be looked at as well, because that may provide a savings opportunity in the future once we get this rolled out.

182
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:06,862
[SPEAKER_12]: for every school principal's office to get an increase in their supply account, we're asking for 203,000.

183
00:25:07,563 --> 00:25:24,994
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a per-pupil basis, so every school will have the same per-pupil amount, but it will be based on the number of students that they have at the school, which is something I heard loud and clear when I met with the principals.

184
00:25:26,435 --> 00:25:36,624
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we are proposing a new position for payroll in the business office and a position in the human resource office.

185
00:25:38,385 --> 00:25:50,375
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very challenging to keep up with the weekly and biweekly needs of the payroll and also kind of maintain our NPRS reporting.

186
00:25:52,242 --> 00:26:02,328
[SPEAKER_12]: fringe benefit management, 403B management, and so this will help alleviate some of that.

187
00:26:08,771 --> 00:26:14,675
[SPEAKER_12]: So believe it or not, all those proposed changes total up to $8.2 million, which is,

188
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:20,597
[SPEAKER_12]: a lot for one year in a budget.

189
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:29,025
[SPEAKER_12]: In a perfect world, we would get that, and our budget would go to $79.4 million.

190
00:26:30,726 --> 00:26:34,610
[SPEAKER_12]: But we're not going to get that, and we have to look at

191
00:26:36,712 --> 00:26:47,936
[SPEAKER_12]: ways to save money in the existing budget so we can kind of redeploy those funds into other areas where we need the money, which I've just identified.

192
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:52,678
[SPEAKER_12]: The first thing we looked at was class size.

193
00:26:53,819 --> 00:27:05,343
[SPEAKER_12]: And based on our October 1 reporting, the average K through five general ed class size in the elementaries, you could see we're kind of

194
00:27:06,953 --> 00:27:11,054
[SPEAKER_12]: at the low point 16.5, at the high point 19.3.

195
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:24,739
[SPEAKER_12]: So we did look at making some adjustments to boost those class sizes up a little bit in order to achieve some savings.

196
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:29,501
[SPEAKER_12]: And

197
00:27:31,101 --> 00:27:41,010
[SPEAKER_12]: So there are some changes going on within schools that I did not add to this slide because I didn't want to make it too busy.

198
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:47,056
[SPEAKER_12]: But for example, at the Brooks, we talked about this low grade 2

199
00:27:48,897 --> 00:28:05,969
[SPEAKER_12]: enrollment, and that we think that one grade two teacher could be at the Brooks, but we also think we're gonna need a grade three teacher at the Brooks to keep those class sizes reasonable.

200
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:17,336
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of a wash, and there's an extra grade four position at the McGlynn, for instance, and a grade one that we're

201
00:28:19,438 --> 00:28:39,566
[SPEAKER_12]: discontinuing in order to provide that grade one for newcomers, but the count right now is two FTEs from McGlynn Elementary, five from the Missittuck at just about every grade level except for the fifth, and then one at the Roberts, and that's in grade two.

202
00:28:41,092 --> 00:28:57,760
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we're also proposing that we add a position to create a new grade one newcomers program at the McGlynn, and this is based on kindergarten enrollment and this population of students currently in kindergarten.

203
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:03,143
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we're proposing two new special education,

204
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:10,907
[SPEAKER_12]: teachers at the Roberts, one for inclusion and one for the connections program.

205
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,470
[SPEAKER_12]: So the net savings there is $318,000.

206
00:29:17,913 --> 00:29:26,500
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this would be the average school class size once we implemented those changes.

207
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:31,745
[SPEAKER_12]: So going from kind of mid to high teens to

208
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:38,422
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, low to low 20s.

209
00:29:41,104 --> 00:29:57,036
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have contractual language that we have to pay attention to in the teacher's contract around class size, but these are within those, that required amount.

210
00:30:01,345 --> 00:30:13,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Then at the middle school, and I'll talk about this at the end, but the middle school also has very low class size, but there's reasons around that.

211
00:30:14,589 --> 00:30:19,491
[SPEAKER_12]: And it gets to the co-teaching model that's employed there.

212
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:27,374
[SPEAKER_12]: So for now, we did not kind of take a deep dive into that model, but we are looking at it.

213
00:30:29,206 --> 00:30:32,727
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see how we can address that later on.

214
00:30:32,887 --> 00:30:44,570
[SPEAKER_12]: But we do think that the guidance staffing is rich when you compare it to national guidelines for guidance.

215
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:52,771
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's roughly like one guidance council for every 500 students is kind of the national norm.

216
00:30:56,695 --> 00:30:58,857
[SPEAKER_12]: or goal to have.

217
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,584
[SPEAKER_12]: Most school systems are much higher than that, like one to 700.

218
00:31:07,726 --> 00:31:12,809
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have less than 500 students in each of our middle schools, and we have four guidance counselors.

219
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:17,972
[SPEAKER_12]: So we think we can reduce that staffing by two.

220
00:31:18,953 --> 00:31:26,457
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the PE Health, we have four phys ed teachers between the,

221
00:31:28,408 --> 00:31:34,630
[SPEAKER_12]: Andrews and McGlynn, and we have one health teacher that's split between the two schools.

222
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:41,632
[SPEAKER_12]: We think it would be better to have one PE teacher for each school and one health teacher for each school.

223
00:31:42,912 --> 00:31:50,594
[SPEAKER_12]: So that would increase the health component and would take a savings of one position there.

224
00:31:51,584 --> 00:32:01,725
[SPEAKER_12]: And at the high school, we waited until students chose their grades for next year to take a look at.

225
00:32:03,117 --> 00:32:06,718
[SPEAKER_12]: how that affected enrollment in each of the sections.

226
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:17,123
[SPEAKER_12]: We also looked at schedules of teachers to make sure that we were fully utilizing the time that's available to the district.

227
00:32:18,723 --> 00:32:29,308
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we came up with a reduction of six teachers at the high school, and that is affecting

228
00:32:30,765 --> 00:32:38,709
[SPEAKER_12]: the PE department, technology, performing arts, vocational program, and world language.

229
00:32:45,253 --> 00:32:56,979
[SPEAKER_12]: We also are proposing some consolidation of our administrative staffing and trying to figure out ways to divide the work

230
00:32:58,338 --> 00:33:17,116
[SPEAKER_12]: amongst a small group of administrators, but essentially it's six administrators for a savings of a little over $800,000, and it affects athletics, library media, performing arts, special education, student assessment, and world language.

231
00:33:23,641 --> 00:33:31,126
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we're also proposing a similar consolidation in our administrative assistant staffing.

232
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:44,193
[SPEAKER_12]: So we are looking to kind of consolidate some positions so that one administrative assistant has like a broader portfolio of work.

233
00:33:44,434 --> 00:33:52,739
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're consolidating from two positions to one between nursing and guidance departments.

234
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:11,672
[SPEAKER_12]: consolidating from three to two administrative assistants in the high school assistant principal's office, consolidating from two to one between the two McGlynn principal's offices.

235
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:28,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Same thing with curriculum directors, consolidating that position in the student assessment support is being recommended to not be continued.

236
00:34:29,162 --> 00:34:32,444
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there's one position in the before and after school program.

237
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:39,329
[SPEAKER_12]: that doesn't have any savings to the general fund, but yet it's also on this list.

238
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:44,293
[SPEAKER_12]: But one thing that's not on the slide deck is that

239
00:34:45,595 --> 00:34:50,917
[SPEAKER_12]: There are currently two administrative assistants in our special ed administration.

240
00:34:51,897 --> 00:35:01,620
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of those women, as part of her responsibilities, handles a lot of transportation that comes out of that office.

241
00:35:02,241 --> 00:35:11,744
[SPEAKER_12]: And what we're proposing is to repurpose that position to be more of a district-wide transportation coordinator, because they do a very good job in managing

242
00:35:12,324 --> 00:35:19,972
[SPEAKER_12]: those services, and it's more of a struggle for the EL bus and the homeless transportation.

243
00:35:20,052 --> 00:35:34,646
[SPEAKER_12]: And we think if we dedicate more resources to the management of that, there's likely some opportunities to lower costs in that area, I think, as long as the ridership doesn't grow.

244
00:35:38,996 --> 00:35:41,478
[SPEAKER_12]: And then same with the nurses.

245
00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:57,392
[SPEAKER_12]: If you look at what the DPH minimums are and kind of apply that to our staffing pattern, we think we can reduce our current nurse staff by three.

246
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:05,579
[SPEAKER_12]: There's also one nurse that we're not continuing that was part of the ESSA slide deck or slide.

247
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:09,127
[SPEAKER_12]: but it's just noted on this one.

248
00:36:09,528 --> 00:36:15,452
[SPEAKER_12]: And that ESSA-funded one was vacant at the time for a savings of $211,000.

249
00:36:15,492 --> 00:36:20,416
[SPEAKER_12]: So all told, these savings come up to almost $2.3 million.

250
00:36:20,456 --> 00:36:23,518
[SPEAKER_12]: There's 42.6 positions that have been approved

251
00:36:33,737 --> 00:36:37,858
[SPEAKER_12]: will be discontinued under this proposal, but we'll be adding 25.2.

252
00:36:38,798 --> 00:36:51,221
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, the 20.2 of those positions added actually already exist, and they're here, and they're funded by ESSA currently.

253
00:36:53,181 --> 00:37:01,323
[SPEAKER_12]: So basically, we're kind of redeploying those funds to cover some of those positions, but we do have a net position reduction of 17.4 FTEs.

254
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:27,766
[SPEAKER_12]: So just to begin to summarize where we're at, once we apply the savings, we can get our required budget down to $77.1 million, but that presents us with a funding gap of almost $6 million.

255
00:37:36,764 --> 00:37:42,527
[SPEAKER_12]: And we had two new initiatives we thought we could kind of bring to this problem.

256
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:47,109
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not anywhere near what we need to solve the problem, but it's a little bit.

257
00:37:47,709 --> 00:38:04,898
[SPEAKER_12]: We've talked about implementing a chargeback system so we can recover some of our payroll and HR costs, as well as facilities costs for our fee-funded programs.

258
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:14,368
[SPEAKER_12]: that are being supported by Medford public schools that, you know, before and after school would be the big one, but

259
00:38:15,778 --> 00:38:19,440
[SPEAKER_12]: there's Kids Corner and the Driver Ed program.

260
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:34,027
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have to stay away from programs that receive federal grants because they have a different methodology to recover those funds.

261
00:38:34,387 --> 00:38:35,948
[SPEAKER_12]: It's called indirect costs.

262
00:38:36,729 --> 00:38:41,271
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'd have to do some more analysis of Title I, for instance.

263
00:38:41,911 --> 00:38:42,571
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if,

264
00:38:44,269 --> 00:38:50,274
[SPEAKER_12]: If we begin to charge indirect costs, are we going to reduce the number of reading teachers that we have on that grant?

265
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:54,317
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have to be strategic before we move into those programs.

266
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:58,641
[SPEAKER_12]: But we do have the ability to do that with grant-funded programs.

267
00:38:59,864 --> 00:39:14,390
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I believe we have sufficient fund balances to charge a teacher that is involved with the MEEP program to the MEEP revolving fund and a teacher in the vocational program.

268
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:19,760
[SPEAKER_12]: to charge that to their tuition account.

269
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,300
[SPEAKER_12]: But these are basically one-time moves.

270
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:32,722
[SPEAKER_12]: We would have to revisit this in FY26 because there may not be sufficient fund balances to do the same thing next year.

271
00:39:37,703 --> 00:39:42,264
[SPEAKER_12]: So when we apply those additional resources to the budget, we get our,

272
00:39:44,454 --> 00:39:50,036
[SPEAKER_12]: budget down to 76, a little under $76.7 million.

273
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:59,319
[SPEAKER_12]: That still leaves us with a funding gap of 5.5 versus our current general fund budget.

274
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:12,323
[SPEAKER_12]: We have heard from the city, at least their initial appropriation increase is 2.3 million.

275
00:40:15,842 --> 00:40:25,469
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm also requesting that if we get additional Chapter 70 money, that we be allowed to use that to support the budget.

276
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:33,374
[SPEAKER_12]: There's good indication to believe that the House will increase its minimum

277
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:49,032
[SPEAKER_12]: minimum funding for Chapter 70, which Medford receives from $30 per student to $104 per student, and that would result in an increase of $470,000 versus Chapter 70 this year.

278
00:40:58,263 --> 00:41:02,945
[SPEAKER_12]: And that could also go up by the time the budget winds its way through the Senate.

279
00:41:04,566 --> 00:41:12,889
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, the history of the state is that the budgets get finalized in July and August, and that's going to be too late for us.

280
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:14,890
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think we'll know.

281
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,771
[SPEAKER_12]: The House should be releasing its version of the budget fairly shortly.

282
00:41:21,252 --> 00:41:23,134
[SPEAKER_12]: debating it for about 10 days now.

283
00:41:23,234 --> 00:41:34,684
[SPEAKER_12]: So our foundation budgets will be republished after the House concludes its deliberations and sends the budget over to the Senate.

284
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:42,171
[SPEAKER_12]: So where we're at is, you know, we still have a need of $2.7 million, but I believe that, you know,

285
00:41:47,403 --> 00:41:53,526
[SPEAKER_12]: from the last subcommittee meeting that this is the budget that the school committee wanted to see, you know, what are the real costs?

286
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:56,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Where do we have gaps?

287
00:41:57,287 --> 00:41:58,268
[SPEAKER_12]: How much do we need?

288
00:41:59,869 --> 00:42:14,895
[SPEAKER_12]: But unless, you know, in the event there's no additional resources coming to the budget, we will have to go back and look at positions again.

289
00:42:14,915 --> 00:42:15,896
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we're not,

290
00:42:16,616 --> 00:42:28,025
[SPEAKER_12]: We haven't, as part of this proposal, we haven't looked at paraprofessionals or custodians or security monitors or adjustment counselors.

291
00:42:30,627 --> 00:42:40,775
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we'd probably have to rethink some of our new spending and kind of manage that back.

292
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,523
[SPEAKER_12]: Still more work to done, more work to be done.

293
00:42:51,609 --> 00:42:59,938
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm happy to answer any questions you might have or any thoughts you want me to take back and consider.

294
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:11,050
[SPEAKER_12]: certainly value your input as to where you think we might be cutting too much.

295
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:13,012
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the way this is

296
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:24,155
[SPEAKER_12]: this might roll out is that we're gonna have to come back and kind of see how we address that 2.7.

297
00:43:26,096 --> 00:43:45,272
[SPEAKER_12]: And there'll be an opportunity if you think we made a mistake in one or more of these areas with one or two positions, it'd be an opportunity to add those back as part of a new cycle of spending reductions.

298
00:43:47,904 --> 00:43:50,164
[SPEAKER_20]: for chair, if I may, thank you for the presentation.

299
00:43:51,745 --> 00:43:55,545
[SPEAKER_20]: Does the 2.7 take into account potentially moving the 20%?

300
00:43:55,585 --> 00:43:56,126
[SPEAKER_20]: No, no, it doesn't.

301
00:43:56,186 --> 00:43:57,806
[SPEAKER_20]: That'd be a $500,000 reduction.

302
00:43:57,826 --> 00:43:59,766
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's about 477, but that's, you know, close to 500.

303
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:00,046
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

304
00:44:19,209 --> 00:44:19,690
[SPEAKER_21]: member Graham.

305
00:44:21,712 --> 00:44:25,437
[SPEAKER_17]: Just a couple of questions just make sure I'm clear on that.

306
00:44:26,724 --> 00:44:37,786
[SPEAKER_17]: reductions that are outlined here at the high school are saying six FTEs, and there are six departments listed, so it sounds like a reduction of one teacher per department, is that correct?

307
00:44:37,826 --> 00:44:39,287
[SPEAKER_17]: Administrator, yeah.

308
00:44:39,307 --> 00:44:52,169
[SPEAKER_17]: And does that mean our course offering is being reduced in some way, or is that, are we able to maintain the offering that students selected with this reduction of six?

309
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:55,030
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the proposal is based on the,

310
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:58,661
[SPEAKER_12]: what students chose.

311
00:44:59,621 --> 00:45:17,350
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, if there was a section that only had four students or five students in it, maybe that section doesn't run, but what the students suggested that they want, what the school department is saying they required to take to earn their credits, those are not affected.

312
00:45:19,571 --> 00:45:24,894
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we'll hear from some folks later on, but specifically, there's some questions about

313
00:45:26,448 --> 00:45:31,153
[SPEAKER_17]: drama classes and drama club and all that.

314
00:45:31,233 --> 00:45:33,555
[SPEAKER_17]: So I know that there's a new theater offering this year.

315
00:45:33,595 --> 00:45:34,776
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that being eliminated?

316
00:45:36,218 --> 00:45:40,121
[SPEAKER_12]: It was because the enrollment was low.

317
00:45:40,962 --> 00:45:41,783
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

318
00:45:43,044 --> 00:45:47,408
[SPEAKER_12]: But part of this public hearing is to get feedback.

319
00:45:48,131 --> 00:45:50,532
[SPEAKER_12]: from the school committee to get feedback from the public.

320
00:45:51,233 --> 00:46:04,280
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're certainly gonna be listening to see how we can kind of meet the needs of everybody in the context that it's just a very difficult budget.

321
00:46:06,081 --> 00:46:14,005
[SPEAKER_17]: Second question is when you said we're reducing our nursing staff to align to the DPH minimums, what are those minimums?

322
00:46:15,246 --> 00:46:14,005
500.

323
00:46:15,646 --> 00:46:16,547
[SPEAKER_12]: One nurse for every 500.

324
00:46:21,431 --> 00:46:22,492
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

325
00:46:22,632 --> 00:46:23,152
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks, Jerry.

326
00:46:25,874 --> 00:46:42,545
[SPEAKER_17]: And I guess my other question is like, we're already reducing, you know, a net reduction of 17 point something is that's about 2.2.

327
00:46:44,266 --> 00:46:50,931
[SPEAKER_17]: So it sounds like if we needed to close another $2.7 million gap, we'd be looking at like another

328
00:46:52,099 --> 00:46:56,222
[SPEAKER_17]: round commiserate with that size, where would those teachers come from?

329
00:46:57,743 --> 00:47:04,649
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I just did a quick analysis of our new spending and

330
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:21,756
[SPEAKER_12]: with the caveat that it kind of goes against the needs that I described, that maybe we could trim that back by 800,000 and kind of take a two-year view and rolling all that out.

331
00:47:24,499 --> 00:47:31,004
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the balance in the absence of any other resources would be around 2.2.

332
00:47:32,385 --> 00:47:37,630
[SPEAKER_12]: So very similar to the proposal we have currently.

333
00:47:38,454 --> 00:47:39,455
[SPEAKER_17]: So another 17-ish people.

334
00:47:39,575 --> 00:47:43,860
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what you're saying?

335
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,661
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

336
00:47:44,841 --> 00:47:45,862
[SPEAKER_12]: Although, yeah.

337
00:47:46,343 --> 00:47:52,650
[SPEAKER_12]: And it depends on the positions and the salary they command.

338
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:59,657
[SPEAKER_12]: So this particular mix was a net 17, but it might be different.

339
00:48:02,805 --> 00:48:09,607
[SPEAKER_12]: if we get into positions that come in, you know, have lower salaries.

340
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:10,968
[SPEAKER_17]: Got it.

341
00:48:12,588 --> 00:48:29,094
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I think the other thing that sort of struck me, and this is not a comment for you necessarily, but just as a general comment, when we talk about enrollment trends and we talk about seeing declines continuing at the middle school and high school, that will never change if we keep doing this this way.

342
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:51,859
[SPEAKER_12]: We did, I did say, I would talk a little bit about the middle school so we did you know that has the co teaching model and, you know, that was a district decision at some point.

343
00:48:54,534 --> 00:49:00,922
[SPEAKER_12]: It requires a much larger investment in staff in order to make that work.

344
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:10,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Co-teachers get more prep time, there's more need for Unified Arts to cover those prep times, so there's a lot of

345
00:49:11,826 --> 00:49:15,348
[SPEAKER_12]: resources being deployed to make that work.

346
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:22,934
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think looking back, we have to figure out a way to say, is the investment worth it?

347
00:49:22,974 --> 00:49:25,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we seeing the results that we should be seeing?

348
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:30,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Or is there a different way to go forward on that?

349
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,122
[SPEAKER_12]: But the staff savings would be significant.

350
00:49:42,692 --> 00:49:45,133
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I just wanted to say, you know, thank you.

351
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:49,316
[SPEAKER_17]: I know this is like the worst work in the world to do.

352
00:49:49,856 --> 00:49:52,497
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will say, I appreciate the clarity.

353
00:49:52,517 --> 00:49:55,739
[SPEAKER_17]: I know exactly what this budget proposal is and isn't.

354
00:49:57,199 --> 00:49:59,321
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure we've ever quite had that before.

355
00:49:59,481 --> 00:50:01,342
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that's important.

356
00:50:02,442 --> 00:50:12,187
[SPEAKER_17]: I also think the sort of the steps and the care that you've taken to be in conversation with our union partners, where there are reductions that are being put forward

357
00:50:12,645 --> 00:50:16,587
[SPEAKER_17]: in advance of learning about those things here on the floor is really important.

358
00:50:17,568 --> 00:50:18,668
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that's really hard work.

359
00:50:19,189 --> 00:50:20,850
[SPEAKER_17]: I know it's terrible news to share.

360
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,931
[SPEAKER_17]: I know it's terrible news to receive.

361
00:50:23,651 --> 00:50:25,792
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's even more terrible to learn that here.

362
00:50:25,932 --> 00:50:34,877
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you for taking care through this process to be appropriately transparent and also

363
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:40,643
[SPEAKER_17]: in collaboration or in conversation at minimum with our union partners.

364
00:50:40,703 --> 00:50:41,243
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

365
00:50:41,283 --> 00:50:42,404
[SPEAKER_17]: I really appreciate that.

366
00:50:42,524 --> 00:50:44,786
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we need more clarity.

367
00:50:45,066 --> 00:50:46,507
[SPEAKER_17]: We need less big budgets.

368
00:50:47,067 --> 00:50:55,853
[SPEAKER_17]: And this really is a great example of what a transparent budget looks like, even if the answers are really very terrible.

369
00:50:55,953 --> 00:50:56,454
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

370
00:50:56,814 --> 00:50:57,134
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

371
00:50:57,274 --> 00:50:57,655
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

372
00:50:58,895 --> 00:50:59,556
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Reinfeldt.

373
00:51:03,198 --> 00:51:03,319
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

374
00:51:07,244 --> 00:51:07,544
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

375
00:51:09,185 --> 00:51:09,665
[SPEAKER_36]: Hi, hello.

376
00:51:09,965 --> 00:51:12,627
[SPEAKER_36]: I just have a couple of questions regarding the proposed budget.

377
00:51:13,127 --> 00:51:18,450
[SPEAKER_36]: So on slide 15, there's two positions being proposed.

378
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:22,432
[SPEAKER_36]: It says payroll slash HR new positions, capacity and supervision.

379
00:51:22,932 --> 00:51:31,876
[SPEAKER_36]: So with the current proposed budget cuts, could you just elaborate on what these two positions being added with considering they cost roughly $150,000 annually?

380
00:51:33,476 --> 00:51:34,978
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

381
00:51:36,179 --> 00:51:39,904
[SPEAKER_12]: Those, so for instance, one is for payroll.

382
00:51:40,245 --> 00:51:48,355
[SPEAKER_12]: So the staffing for the entire district for a budget that's 80% salary.

383
00:51:50,457 --> 00:51:52,279
[SPEAKER_12]: there's two payroll positions.

384
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:58,244
[SPEAKER_12]: And this year, one of those individuals went on maternity leave.

385
00:51:58,925 --> 00:52:02,708
[SPEAKER_12]: So that effectively cut the payroll staff in half.

386
00:52:03,509 --> 00:52:05,891
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've figured out a way to kind of work around it.

387
00:52:05,951 --> 00:52:12,037
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of our administrative assistants have stepped up and we're kind of spreading out the work.

388
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:19,255
[SPEAKER_12]: but our assistant finance director has taken on a lot of that payroll as well.

389
00:52:20,796 --> 00:52:28,104
[SPEAKER_12]: But my read since I've gotten here is that

390
00:52:29,574 --> 00:52:33,256
[SPEAKER_12]: we have a very difficult time keeping up with the work that we have.

391
00:52:33,356 --> 00:52:43,021
[SPEAKER_12]: So the payroll itself, the keying in, changing deductions when people request it, changing payroll.

392
00:52:43,141 --> 00:52:51,705
[SPEAKER_12]: Payroll is changing throughout the year as people are in degrees or they get promoted into a different job.

393
00:52:51,725 --> 00:52:52,706
[SPEAKER_12]: That,

394
00:52:55,475 --> 00:53:03,384
[SPEAKER_12]: the growth in that area has left very little time for those payroll clerks to address kind of the maintenance of the budget.

395
00:53:04,706 --> 00:53:11,514
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a whole, there's a significant requirement for the,

396
00:53:14,076 --> 00:53:20,359
[SPEAKER_12]: MTRS reporting to keep those, their database current.

397
00:53:20,459 --> 00:53:24,981
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're having problems where, you know, teachers are having difficulty

398
00:53:27,895 --> 00:53:36,541
[SPEAKER_12]: trying to retire or trying to project how much they would get in retirement because we were just not able to respond to all those inquiries.

399
00:53:37,903 --> 00:53:40,004
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there's the supervision.

400
00:53:40,104 --> 00:53:49,731
[SPEAKER_12]: So the way I looked at the office was we have an accounts payable department, we have a payroll department, one person,

401
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:58,861
[SPEAKER_12]: for two payroll people, one person for accounts payable, and that to me is kind of a logical staffing.

402
00:53:58,921 --> 00:54:09,468
[SPEAKER_12]: So the rank and file people have some extra resources to go to ask questions on how to do their job and to plan out their work.

403
00:54:11,574 --> 00:54:36,925
[SPEAKER_12]: For the HR department, same way, it's just the whole, the number of positions that we have, the whole onboarding process for new, the priority is obviously teachers at the beginning of the year, but we're in desperate need for substitute teachers, and if people are emailing us saying they would like to work as a substitute, we can't get to them.

404
00:54:37,685 --> 00:54:45,095
[SPEAKER_12]: because we're so deep into onboarding instructional staff.

405
00:54:46,536 --> 00:54:55,468
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's just that the amount of administrative work has just grown beyond the staffing levels in those two departments.

406
00:55:00,752 --> 00:55:08,343
[SPEAKER_36]: And then I just had another question on slide 19 for the proposed general ed class size from schools.

407
00:55:08,724 --> 00:55:11,748
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, for 2025 for the Brooks it'd be up to 19.9.

408
00:55:13,505 --> 00:55:16,887
[SPEAKER_36]: The McGlynn 22.2, Mr. Tuck 22, and then the Roberts 20.5.

409
00:55:16,927 --> 00:55:33,655
[SPEAKER_36]: Do you have any data about the possible negatives of increasing classroom sizes to that size as that could potentially put a lot of strain on teachers and educators in classrooms?

410
00:55:35,854 --> 00:55:40,197
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I look at two things.

411
00:55:40,677 --> 00:55:42,759
[SPEAKER_12]: One is, how do we get our funding?

412
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:50,184
[SPEAKER_12]: So Chapter 70 makes some assumptions about class size when they put together the foundation budget.

413
00:55:50,844 --> 00:55:51,925
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's like

414
00:55:56,105 --> 00:56:09,724
[SPEAKER_12]: 22 or 25 at the elementary and then 22 or 25 at the middle, and then it's actually 17 at the high school because of all the honors and AP classes, there's just on average the class sizes are going to be lower at the high school.

415
00:56:11,386 --> 00:56:22,136
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we're not maintaining our class sizes somewhat around those numbers, we don't have to hit them exactly, but we should be in the same ballpark.

416
00:56:22,456 --> 00:56:30,845
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we're not, we're going to be diverting resources from one area to put into low class sizes.

417
00:56:33,789 --> 00:56:42,278
[SPEAKER_12]: The research is very mixed on whether a lower class size actually improves student performance.

418
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:47,604
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the most expensive type of educational reform that you can do.

419
00:56:49,025 --> 00:56:58,032
[SPEAKER_12]: does tend to, obviously, in specialized programs, special ed actually has legal requirements about what their class sizes should be.

420
00:56:58,052 --> 00:57:06,278
[SPEAKER_12]: Our EL program, the class sizes should be lower, obviously, so more one-to-one time with the teacher.

421
00:57:07,239 --> 00:57:15,665
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the lower grades, pre-K and kindergarten, there is evidence that those low class sizes are probably more effective.

422
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,366
[SPEAKER_12]: But when you start to move up,

423
00:57:18,867 --> 00:57:20,008
[SPEAKER_12]: it's kind of a mixed bag.

424
00:57:20,068 --> 00:57:27,975
[SPEAKER_12]: So my view is, let's not be too low, let's not be too high, but let's try to keep it.

425
00:57:28,176 --> 00:57:32,960
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think low 20s is kind of a good spot to be in.

426
00:57:36,083 --> 00:57:40,767
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything more than that, I think there would be a status strain, but

427
00:57:42,205 --> 00:57:48,271
[SPEAKER_12]: If we have to cut 2.7 million dollars we might have to think about increasing those slightly again.

428
00:57:49,372 --> 00:57:52,935
[SPEAKER_12]: If we have no other way to do it.

429
00:57:57,319 --> 00:57:57,820
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you down.

430
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:01,083
[SPEAKER_20]: Member right felt yes, thank you.

431
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:08,007
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, I'll start with what I like, which is I like the transparency and the clarity here.

432
00:58:08,147 --> 00:58:09,927
[SPEAKER_28]: So thank you again for that.

433
00:58:10,327 --> 00:58:12,968
[SPEAKER_28]: And I really like that this reflects the past year of spending.

434
00:58:12,988 --> 00:58:16,769
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's incredibly helpful.

435
00:58:17,149 --> 00:58:18,869
[SPEAKER_28]: And that moves into my first question.

436
00:58:18,889 --> 00:58:20,950
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm just gonna go in numerical order.

437
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:26,851
[SPEAKER_28]: Slide seven, this didn't appear on the slide, but you mentioned that there was 500K for undistributed.

438
00:58:27,951 --> 00:58:32,612
[SPEAKER_28]: Was that used for its intended purpose last year or did that end up being flexed?

439
00:58:33,001 --> 00:58:40,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the year before that, I'm trying to, I think it was like one and a half million dollars.

440
00:58:40,823 --> 00:58:50,865
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know, at one committee, the whole, we talked about the fact that to make the 24 budget work, those budgets were reduced.

441
00:58:51,365 --> 00:58:59,127
[SPEAKER_12]: But part of that money is meant to cover negotiations for contracts that are being negotiated.

442
00:58:59,147 --> 00:58:59,207
[SPEAKER_12]: And

443
00:59:01,693 --> 00:59:05,436
[SPEAKER_12]: that money was needed to make the budget balance.

444
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:18,585
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that went to fund those contracts and was not sufficient to fund the contracts that got settled.

445
00:59:18,645 --> 00:59:28,051
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's just helping to allow us to finish the year with a balanced budget.

446
00:59:29,134 --> 00:59:29,594
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

447
00:59:30,255 --> 00:59:32,356
[SPEAKER_28]: Slide 14, you mentioned new technology.

448
00:59:33,137 --> 00:59:43,883
[SPEAKER_28]: Is this coming with added security concerns or costs to maintain safety, privacy, all of that?

449
00:59:44,803 --> 00:59:48,145
[SPEAKER_12]: We've included the educational package for Google.

450
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:56,010
[SPEAKER_12]: And that, right now, we're using the free version, the educational package.

451
00:59:59,246 --> 01:00:03,167
[SPEAKER_12]: it will provide a lot more security for that programming.

452
01:00:03,247 --> 01:00:18,130
[SPEAKER_12]: But we really need to develop some strategic planning around technology to address all these needs that we have and securities, you know, top of the list.

453
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:20,111
[SPEAKER_28]: But that's one of the positions that is

454
01:00:20,905 --> 01:00:21,525
[SPEAKER_28]: potentially?

455
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:30,827
[SPEAKER_12]: No, so there's two, the technology where we're adding money is in our network infrastructure, to keep that going.

456
01:00:31,647 --> 01:00:37,528
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a technology teacher at the high school that we're proposing.

457
01:00:37,668 --> 01:00:39,149
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Peter.

458
01:00:39,389 --> 01:00:45,610
[SPEAKER_12]: We're proposing that we're gonna take a savings there just because enrollment is low.

459
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:46,550
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

460
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:50,511
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's other technology teachers at the high school as well.

461
01:00:51,628 --> 01:00:54,932
[SPEAKER_28]: Right, but there's a director position as well.

462
01:00:56,013 --> 01:00:56,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

463
01:00:57,375 --> 01:01:05,124
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and we would see that consolidated with the rest of our technology staff, the management.

464
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:09,647
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, I'm always gonna have this question on slide 15.

465
01:01:09,747 --> 01:01:12,168
[SPEAKER_28]: I see a lot of contract services listed.

466
01:01:12,849 --> 01:01:18,451
[SPEAKER_28]: What assurances can you give me that contracting these things out is more cost efficient than doing it in-house?

467
01:01:18,651 --> 01:01:19,952
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

468
01:01:21,012 --> 01:01:25,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that for facilities?

469
01:01:26,694 --> 01:01:27,294
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, building.

470
01:01:27,815 --> 01:01:28,555
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah.

471
01:01:29,035 --> 01:01:32,877
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, those are actually, we're already contracting them out.

472
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:33,577
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

473
01:01:33,911 --> 01:01:38,993
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're not budgeting sufficiently for what we're already doing.

474
01:01:41,374 --> 01:01:52,138
[SPEAKER_12]: On the proposal for $120,000, those services are like architectural services, project management services.

475
01:01:53,279 --> 01:02:03,063
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're not, we're not proposing to privatize any work that's currently being done by existing staff.

476
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,162
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, on this same slide, you mentioned the supply budget.

477
01:02:07,282 --> 01:02:14,688
[SPEAKER_28]: Is that going to reduce the, I'll call it an unspoken burden on individual staff members for supplies?

478
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:17,831
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to think so.

479
01:02:20,173 --> 01:02:24,376
[SPEAKER_28]: In terms of, are those for individual classrooms, or are they for school-wide?

480
01:02:24,637 --> 01:02:28,740
[SPEAKER_12]: On a whole, the supply budgets are low.

481
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,822
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think they can be built up.

482
01:02:33,442 --> 01:02:45,926
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I would hope that, and I'm sure that, you know, we have some very good principals and I would hope that they would wanna, they just haven't had a sufficient budget.

483
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:55,589
[SPEAKER_12]: So when they have to say no to a teacher and the teacher needs something, the teacher, you know, goes and procures it herself.

484
01:02:56,209 --> 01:02:59,050
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm glad that we are providing more of that.

485
01:03:02,085 --> 01:03:05,346
[SPEAKER_28]: Member Graham already asked about class sizes and offerings.

486
01:03:07,306 --> 01:03:30,551
[SPEAKER_28]: I would love some more information on the McGlynn position, the consolidation of the administrative position there, given that those are two schools and each of the other schools has its own administrative assistant and also given the particular vulnerabilities in that school's population.

487
01:03:31,294 --> 01:03:33,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

488
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:53,990
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, the role of administrative assistants have changed because administrators are now routinely do a lot of their own work, emails, you know,

489
01:03:57,007 --> 01:04:09,452
[SPEAKER_12]: so that we still need administrative assistance to deal with parents that are calling in and submitting purchase orders for supplies.

490
01:04:11,453 --> 01:04:22,397
[SPEAKER_12]: But it was just felt that there wasn't sufficient workload for the number of administrative assistants that we had at the McGlynn.

491
01:04:25,805 --> 01:04:27,186
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sure we'll hear about that.

492
01:04:27,486 --> 01:04:27,626
[SPEAKER_28]: Yep.

493
01:04:28,046 --> 01:04:29,947
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

494
01:04:30,067 --> 01:04:35,929
[SPEAKER_28]: And then my, my very last question was actually building a little bit on member Graham's question about the DPH minimums.

495
01:04:36,609 --> 01:04:47,033
[SPEAKER_28]: We, my questions were, when are they, where are we and how do our health needs and this, the health needs question might be for some of the people out here compared to other districts with their ratios.

496
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:52,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and those are minimum, so they're not meant to be, um,

497
01:04:54,068 --> 01:05:03,492
[SPEAKER_12]: If you can do more than that, it really depends on kind of the acuity that they're dealing with.

498
01:05:03,672 --> 01:05:16,058
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know nurses are very good about who shows up in their office and what they have medications that they have to give to particularly younger students.

499
01:05:16,678 --> 01:05:20,500
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, we're,

500
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:27,352
[SPEAKER_12]: In the case of the Brooks, we're a little bit above 500.

501
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:35,734
[SPEAKER_12]: The remaining schools are below 500, but close to that.

502
01:05:37,194 --> 01:05:45,236
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can furnish you with some staffing analysis that we've done to show where we're landing with that.

503
01:05:45,396 --> 01:05:45,796
[SPEAKER_12]: But, yeah.

504
01:05:50,546 --> 01:06:11,594
[SPEAKER_12]: What's often the case is that you have, just to simplify it, you have not enough work for two people and you have too much for one person and you can't, so we're looking at coverage and do we have to dedicate staff to one school?

505
01:06:11,654 --> 01:06:14,975
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we dedicate some staff and have some staff move around?

506
01:06:16,313 --> 01:06:21,917
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think everybody said this in one way or the other at the beginning.

507
01:06:22,897 --> 01:06:32,023
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not, we don't take any pleasure in having to implement these, but we know what we have in obligations.

508
01:06:34,184 --> 01:06:34,984
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think

509
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:50,795
[SPEAKER_12]: In my experience, the worst thing is to have budget chaos because when you look at what happened in Brockton and North Andover, that to me would be a lot more disruptive.

510
01:06:50,895 --> 01:06:59,061
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's figure out what the pain is and then see if we can make some adjustments.

511
01:06:59,301 --> 01:07:03,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody's gonna be happy with the end result, but

512
01:07:04,975 --> 01:07:15,099
[SPEAKER_12]: We have, that's the only thing a business manager is required to do by law is to make sure the budget's balanced, and then other duties as assigned.

513
01:07:15,659 --> 01:07:18,440
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're gonna have to, we need to get to a balanced budget.

514
01:07:21,101 --> 01:07:31,830
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, I understand that, and I will have questions for the administration at later dates about what the plan, if these changes are accepted, what the plan is, because just because you take people away, the work doesn't go away either.

515
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:32,531
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, exactly.

516
01:07:32,711 --> 01:07:34,813
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've made some preliminary...

517
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:49,761
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have put a considerable amount of time into, on a very preliminary basis, thinking about how it would happen.

518
01:07:49,861 --> 01:07:57,804
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the next phase would be to actually sit down and kind of plan out how the work will be reallocated.

519
01:08:00,625 --> 01:08:01,025
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

520
01:08:03,826 --> 01:08:04,406
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Brantley.

521
01:08:06,246 --> 01:08:08,667
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, I'd ask if I'm making faces, but I already know I am.

522
01:08:08,867 --> 01:08:11,208
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm trying to,

523
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:15,341
[SPEAKER_29]: center myself because this is obviously horrifying.

524
01:08:16,081 --> 01:08:24,405
[SPEAKER_29]: And as somebody who has worked in an elementary school in this district, I don't see how any of this could even be possible.

525
01:08:27,787 --> 01:08:31,049
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not gonna take it out on you, Jerry, because I know you're doing a job and I thank you for it.

526
01:08:31,109 --> 01:08:34,350
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's not personal, of course, but I have- I don't take it personally.

527
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:35,311
[SPEAKER_29]: A lot of questions.

528
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:39,013
[SPEAKER_29]: So you keep saying we.

529
01:08:39,353 --> 01:08:41,214
[SPEAKER_29]: We came to this decision.

530
01:08:41,234 --> 01:08:41,594
[SPEAKER_29]: Who's the we?

531
01:08:45,523 --> 01:08:50,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Well as a group is it's not Jerry McHugh by himself we sit senior staff.

532
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:57,392
[SPEAKER_12]: Some ideas are rejected because they're not workable.

533
01:08:57,452 --> 01:09:02,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Some ideas might have merit and you kind of keep working them.

534
01:09:03,176 --> 01:09:21,790
[SPEAKER_12]: But we try to be as thoughtful as we could be about the cuts and try to balance them against some kind of standards that easier to do with class size than it is for some of the reorganization work, obviously.

535
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,220
[SPEAKER_29]: We, okay, thank you.

536
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,581
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's see, I'm just gonna go page by page.

537
01:09:36,102 --> 01:09:43,063
[SPEAKER_29]: The ESSER funding, those positions on this page here, Brooke, let's see, I'm on 11.

538
01:09:44,303 --> 01:09:46,444
[SPEAKER_29]: Are any of those gonna be added to the general fund?

539
01:09:46,824 --> 01:09:47,524
[SPEAKER_12]: Any of those positions?

540
01:09:47,544 --> 01:09:48,104
[SPEAKER_12]: They all are.

541
01:09:48,564 --> 01:09:52,245
[SPEAKER_29]: They're all added, okay, I just wanna make sure before I go kooky.

542
01:09:52,885 --> 01:09:53,845
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of,

543
01:09:54,622 --> 01:09:57,725
[SPEAKER_12]: contributing to our funding needs.

544
01:09:59,446 --> 01:10:09,114
[SPEAKER_29]: And I have to agree with our student rep here, the two full-time employees with payroll and HR that are being suggested.

545
01:10:10,015 --> 01:10:13,337
[SPEAKER_29]: You said the words, it's hard for them to keep up.

546
01:10:15,599 --> 01:10:20,403
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think it's gonna be hard for teachers to keep up.

547
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:22,705
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it's gonna be hard for nurses to keep up.

548
01:10:23,106 --> 01:10:26,028
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it's going to be hard for secretaries to keep up at this rate.

549
01:10:28,509 --> 01:10:30,050
[SPEAKER_29]: We're burning people out as it is.

550
01:10:31,211 --> 01:10:32,912
[SPEAKER_29]: And this is going to just increase that.

551
01:10:40,538 --> 01:10:45,502
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, it would be hard to work without two more full-time people, but it'll also be hard to work with only one nurse.

552
01:10:46,262 --> 01:10:50,165
[SPEAKER_29]: It will also be hard to work with only one administrative assistant at the McGlynn.

553
01:10:50,325 --> 01:10:52,326
[SPEAKER_29]: It is two separate schools.

554
01:10:52,907 --> 01:10:54,008
[SPEAKER_29]: It is two separate schools.

555
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:05,516
[SPEAKER_29]: I know they're housed in that same office, but that doesn't make any one more valuable or less valuable than the other.

556
01:11:05,816 --> 01:11:07,077
[SPEAKER_29]: They're two separate schools.

557
01:11:09,028 --> 01:11:12,010
[SPEAKER_29]: It doesn't mean that one can absorb the work of the other.

558
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:21,775
[SPEAKER_29]: And as an administrative assistant myself, I don't see the people that are above me that I'm an administrative assistant to do more work on their own.

559
01:11:27,995 --> 01:11:35,898
[SPEAKER_29]: I see that we're leaned upon more and more every day from something as simple as the coffee machine being jammed.

560
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:39,259
[SPEAKER_29]: Sometimes I pretend I don't hear them saying to me, Nicole, Nicole, I need your help.

561
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:40,979
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm like, it's a piece of paper.

562
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:42,040
[SPEAKER_29]: You can do this.

563
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:43,020
[SPEAKER_29]: Let me show you.

564
01:11:45,161 --> 01:11:48,662
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it's almost offensive to think that

565
01:11:49,588 --> 01:11:53,652
[SPEAKER_29]: you know, their need is less because it truly is more.

566
01:11:53,812 --> 01:12:03,360
[SPEAKER_29]: And especially at an elementary school level where children are coming into you, parents are coming into you, the phone never stops.

567
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:13,028
[SPEAKER_29]: That alone, I don't know how one administrative assistant is gonna just handle the phone alone, let alone all the chaos around them.

568
01:12:13,749 --> 01:12:16,791
[SPEAKER_29]: So how do you choose

569
01:12:17,705 --> 01:12:21,107
[SPEAKER_29]: that elementary school over a different elementary school, because there's not anybody else there.

570
01:12:21,347 --> 01:12:28,912
[SPEAKER_29]: But that doesn't mean that the administrative assistant for the middle school can handle what is going to be put on her from the elementary side.

571
01:12:29,953 --> 01:12:34,196
[SPEAKER_29]: It's almost unfathomable to me to think that that is a position that could at all be cut.

572
01:12:36,297 --> 01:12:37,038
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's one thing.

573
01:12:40,465 --> 01:12:49,933
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, kindergarten teachers added in FY 24 will not be continued in FY 25, but did we not see that the enrollment is increasing in lower grades?

574
01:12:51,634 --> 01:13:03,745
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, but the existing kindergarten staffing that we have is sufficient, I believe, to handle that enrollment.

575
01:13:04,045 --> 01:13:06,367
[SPEAKER_12]: I would question the need for those

576
01:13:08,143 --> 01:13:10,225
[SPEAKER_12]: additional kindergarten teachers this year.

577
01:13:10,245 --> 01:13:13,607
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, maybe one or two, but not across the board.

578
01:13:14,268 --> 01:13:16,770
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't think people- So none will be saved?

579
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:17,771
[SPEAKER_12]: Pardon?

580
01:13:18,011 --> 01:13:19,112
[SPEAKER_29]: None will be saved, correct?

581
01:13:19,372 --> 01:13:20,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they weren't funded for.

582
01:13:20,633 --> 01:13:25,677
[SPEAKER_12]: So if they were to be saved, then we would have to add them into the budget this year.

583
01:13:27,158 --> 01:13:29,039
[SPEAKER_12]: So there was no funding.

584
01:13:29,059 --> 01:13:33,423
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a directive to add them and kind of make it work.

585
01:13:34,699 --> 01:13:47,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Has anybody- And that happens during the year, but you have to fix those positions in the budget the following year to be accurate.

586
01:13:48,646 --> 01:13:50,707
[SPEAKER_29]: Has anybody shadowed anybody in the kindergarten?

587
01:13:54,649 --> 01:13:55,210
[SPEAKER_29]: Just curious.

588
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:55,450
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

589
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:56,751
[SPEAKER_29]: Anybody shadowed the nurses?

590
01:13:57,947 --> 01:14:03,069
[SPEAKER_29]: Has anybody shadowed any of these directors that are being cut to see what's actually happening on a day-to-day basis?

591
01:14:03,429 --> 01:14:14,692
[SPEAKER_29]: Because I can tell you... We have been doing a really good job, I think, trying to get job descriptions.

592
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:19,834
[SPEAKER_29]: But what's written on a piece of paper, what your job is, when you walk into that building,

593
01:14:20,563 --> 01:14:28,372
[SPEAKER_29]: you are a hundred things to hundreds of little humans that can't wait.

594
01:14:29,033 --> 01:14:29,534
[SPEAKER_29]: They can't wait.

595
01:14:29,554 --> 01:14:31,456
[SPEAKER_29]: They're throwing up, they're pooping, they're doing it all.

596
01:14:31,736 --> 01:14:34,319
[SPEAKER_29]: And I don't care what grade they're in, they're all doing it.

597
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:40,787
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think to, you know, cut jobs without literally

598
01:14:41,372 --> 01:14:44,875
[SPEAKER_29]: knowing hands-on, on the ground, what exactly is happening.

599
01:14:45,276 --> 01:14:50,160
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know how much more existing staff, if these are all cut, can handle.

600
01:14:50,681 --> 01:14:51,461
[SPEAKER_29]: How can you handle it?

601
01:14:51,502 --> 01:14:57,867
[SPEAKER_29]: How can you be there from eight to three, which I know is not what a teacher's job is not eight to three, believe me, I know that.

602
01:14:57,947 --> 01:15:00,370
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's 24 hours a day.

603
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:01,971
[SPEAKER_29]: But how do you...

604
01:15:03,052 --> 01:15:05,494
[SPEAKER_29]: How does anybody absorb even more?

605
01:15:06,555 --> 01:15:08,437
[SPEAKER_29]: What is the toll we're going to take on everybody?

606
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:13,521
[SPEAKER_29]: And if we take the toll on our teachers, guess who it's falling down onto?

607
01:15:14,002 --> 01:15:14,482
[SPEAKER_29]: The kids.

608
01:15:15,383 --> 01:15:16,184
[SPEAKER_29]: These are our babies.

609
01:15:16,684 --> 01:15:17,765
[SPEAKER_29]: We want enrollment to go up.

610
01:15:17,825 --> 01:15:19,006
[SPEAKER_29]: It's never going to go up like this.

611
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:19,667
[SPEAKER_29]: Never.

612
01:15:20,187 --> 01:15:20,427
[SPEAKER_29]: Never.

613
01:15:21,788 --> 01:15:24,090
[SPEAKER_29]: People are going to run away.

614
01:15:24,671 --> 01:15:25,512
[SPEAKER_29]: OK, I'll keep going.

615
01:15:29,284 --> 01:15:31,526
[SPEAKER_29]: strain on staff, yes, clearly.

616
01:15:31,546 --> 01:15:38,131
[SPEAKER_29]: I can't imagine being in any class with 22 kindergarten children or 22.2.

617
01:15:38,351 --> 01:15:44,836
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know where the .2 comes from because guidance counselors.

618
01:15:44,956 --> 01:15:46,217
[SPEAKER_29]: I know, I hate averages.

619
01:15:48,218 --> 01:15:50,280
[SPEAKER_29]: So proposed saving initiatives.

620
01:15:51,601 --> 01:15:53,522
[SPEAKER_29]: Do guidance counselors teach guidance classes?

621
01:15:53,542 --> 01:15:53,923
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, correct.

622
01:15:57,361 --> 01:16:02,683
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, so if we cut them, who's doing that and still guiding?

623
01:16:04,864 --> 01:16:07,905
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there'll be less of it.

624
01:16:11,026 --> 01:16:15,548
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's gonna be up to the principal to develop a schedule with the staff that they have.

625
01:16:16,108 --> 01:16:16,668
[SPEAKER_29]: The principals?

626
01:16:18,129 --> 01:16:18,489
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

627
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:22,771
[SPEAKER_29]: So maybe they rely on the administrative assistants a little bit more.

628
01:16:27,024 --> 01:16:29,947
[SPEAKER_29]: And I know these are the numbers, I get it.

629
01:16:30,147 --> 01:16:37,052
[SPEAKER_29]: I get that this is real dollars and there's $5 million or $7 million, the number just seems to keep adding up here.

630
01:16:37,132 --> 01:16:48,241
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm also curious, if we eliminate directors, do directors walk out the door or do they then absorb a teaching job?

631
01:16:48,522 --> 01:16:49,202
[SPEAKER_29]: How does that work?

632
01:16:50,143 --> 01:16:52,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, in any of these cases,

633
01:16:55,410 --> 01:17:00,932
[SPEAKER_12]: We would try to work as best we can to make sure there's a landing spot for these positions.

634
01:17:02,793 --> 01:17:05,614
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't always do it because there's certification requirements.

635
01:17:07,735 --> 01:17:14,117
[SPEAKER_12]: That is a question right now, and we believe that they're two separate unions.

636
01:17:14,937 --> 01:17:23,060
[SPEAKER_12]: So I do not believe there's an automatic claim to a teaching position if you're coming from the administrative ranks.

637
01:17:26,049 --> 01:17:27,651
[SPEAKER_12]: there's gonna be bumping.

638
01:17:27,691 --> 01:17:43,767
[SPEAKER_12]: So the budget is really about cutting positions and not people because the budget, there's bumping in the contracts and those people might still have a job because they have seniority and somebody else might have to go.

639
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,103
[SPEAKER_12]: But that is something that we looked at.

640
01:17:49,603 --> 01:17:56,671
[SPEAKER_12]: And if there are teaching positions for some of these administrators, of course, we would love to keep them in the district.

641
01:17:57,852 --> 01:18:01,356
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's one of those, the answer is it depends.

642
01:18:01,997 --> 01:18:04,820
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, so I know you said it's a position.

643
01:18:05,532 --> 01:18:07,873
[SPEAKER_29]: Not a person, but at the end of the day, it is a person.

644
01:18:07,893 --> 01:18:08,753
[SPEAKER_29]: It is at the end of the day.

645
01:18:08,773 --> 01:18:12,174
[SPEAKER_29]: It is at the end of the day, because if you're bumping someone, someone else is out.

646
01:18:12,314 --> 01:18:12,834
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, no, totally.

647
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,915
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's less, and I know you realize that.

648
01:18:14,935 --> 01:18:17,076
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't mean to that, yeah, to say it.

649
01:18:17,516 --> 01:18:24,038
[SPEAKER_29]: And I can't imagine any of these schools working with one body less at this point.

650
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:29,659
[SPEAKER_29]: I really, it's gonna be detrimental, it really is.

651
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:30,820
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

652
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:31,580
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

653
01:18:33,939 --> 01:18:36,180
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, McGlynn principal office consolidated from two to one.

654
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,100
[SPEAKER_29]: That's outrageous.

655
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:40,561
[SPEAKER_29]: Reduce nursing staff.

656
01:18:41,101 --> 01:18:43,761
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm sure the nurses that are here can help us understand that.

657
01:18:44,522 --> 01:18:48,162
[SPEAKER_29]: Can someone tell me how many students are at each elementary school just to start there?

658
01:18:49,323 --> 01:18:52,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I can furnish you with an analysis that they did.

659
01:18:52,363 --> 01:18:58,385
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's based on what we predict the enrollment will be next year and how many nurses per student.

660
01:18:59,405 --> 01:19:02,666
[SPEAKER_29]: So maybe the nurses can answer my question a little bit better.

661
01:19:04,218 --> 01:19:09,263
[SPEAKER_29]: working at the Brooks.

662
01:19:09,283 --> 01:19:15,809
[SPEAKER_29]: I used to say to Nurse Allison all the time, I feel like we should have one of those little deli ticket things here.

663
01:19:17,490 --> 01:19:24,477
[SPEAKER_29]: Because not only are there emergencies all day, I mean, I can tell you what happens in the kindergarten playground pretty clearly.

664
01:19:28,376 --> 01:19:35,161
[SPEAKER_29]: What happens if that nurse needs to, they leave the room, now the nurse's office is closed, and there's another emergency?

665
01:19:36,482 --> 01:19:41,686
[SPEAKER_29]: Field trips, how do we manage field trips with less nurses?

666
01:19:41,766 --> 01:19:43,668
[SPEAKER_29]: Things like this that keep popping into my head.

667
01:19:44,128 --> 01:19:49,673
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know how these things are gonna get done with less bodies.

668
01:19:49,913 --> 01:19:50,793
[SPEAKER_29]: It's not gonna get done?

669
01:19:53,295 --> 01:19:53,456
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's...

670
01:19:55,319 --> 01:19:56,179
[SPEAKER_29]: That's really sad.

671
01:19:56,559 --> 01:19:58,780
[SPEAKER_29]: It's not okay.

672
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,061
[SPEAKER_29]: And then if a nurse is absent, what happens?

673
01:20:02,441 --> 01:20:03,142
[SPEAKER_29]: Everybody hold on.

674
01:20:05,802 --> 01:20:09,043
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be up to the director to- Do we have a director?

675
01:20:10,944 --> 01:20:15,886
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we have a position in the budget and we have a director.

676
01:20:16,606 --> 01:20:18,967
[SPEAKER_12]: So we expect that we will have a director.

677
01:20:19,627 --> 01:20:21,127
[SPEAKER_29]: So we'll have a director for the nurses.

678
01:20:22,788 --> 01:20:22,968
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes?

679
01:20:23,723 --> 01:20:26,404
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, we'll have a director for the nurses.

680
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:36,946
[SPEAKER_29]: So the director for the nurses will figure that out, right?

681
01:20:37,366 --> 01:20:38,907
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, great.

682
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:40,807
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Brantley.

683
01:20:40,827 --> 01:20:42,208
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's see, what else?

684
01:20:42,748 --> 01:20:43,328
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Brantley.

685
01:20:43,668 --> 01:20:43,928
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

686
01:20:44,708 --> 01:20:44,908
[SPEAKER_20]: Ms.

687
01:20:44,948 --> 01:20:46,509
[SPEAKER_20]: Hines was the director.

688
01:20:46,569 --> 01:20:49,189
[SPEAKER_20]: She just took another job, so I'm sure it's posted.

689
01:20:50,230 --> 01:20:51,330
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a lot of jobs posted.

690
01:20:54,277 --> 01:20:56,679
[SPEAKER_29]: a lot not filled, and that's what scares me.

691
01:20:57,260 --> 01:20:59,582
[SPEAKER_29]: Because if it's not filled, then what?

692
01:21:00,223 --> 01:21:06,850
[SPEAKER_29]: We need to know the then what's here when we do something like this, because this is real day-to-day challenges.

693
01:21:07,150 --> 01:21:11,675
[SPEAKER_29]: And I know, even for myself, I've needed the school nurse at times.

694
01:21:12,476 --> 01:21:14,038
[SPEAKER_29]: I got COVID when I worked at the Brooks.

695
01:21:15,402 --> 01:21:16,604
[SPEAKER_29]: How many times I was checked for lice?

696
01:21:16,864 --> 01:21:17,705
[SPEAKER_29]: Luckily, never got it.

697
01:21:17,805 --> 01:21:18,165
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know how.

698
01:21:18,185 --> 01:21:20,889
[SPEAKER_29]: But do you know how many times my head was checked for lice?

699
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:23,552
[SPEAKER_29]: Do you know how many times I had to go to the nurse's office for something?

700
01:21:23,572 --> 01:21:25,334
[SPEAKER_29]: A student injured me.

701
01:21:25,854 --> 01:21:26,455
[SPEAKER_29]: That happens.

702
01:21:26,956 --> 01:21:30,420
[SPEAKER_29]: This is real, live stuff that's happening every single day.

703
01:21:31,061 --> 01:21:35,506
[SPEAKER_29]: And we're, I don't want to use the word failing, but I'm

704
01:21:36,654 --> 01:21:37,475
[SPEAKER_29]: failing, happening.

705
01:21:39,116 --> 01:21:40,497
[SPEAKER_29]: Identifying other resources.

706
01:21:41,157 --> 01:21:42,438
[SPEAKER_29]: You said we'll need to revisit this in 2026.

707
01:21:43,038 --> 01:21:45,059
[SPEAKER_29]: Will there be funds?

708
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:49,102
[SPEAKER_29]: So we're cutting, but then we're gonna have to revisit again for even more cuts.

709
01:21:49,742 --> 01:21:50,002
[SPEAKER_29]: Great.

710
01:21:51,103 --> 01:21:51,623
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

711
01:21:54,945 --> 01:21:55,886
[SPEAKER_29]: All right, let's see.

712
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:56,887
[SPEAKER_29]: This page.

713
01:22:00,289 --> 01:22:03,731
[SPEAKER_29]: You said we haven't looked at paras, custodians,

714
01:22:06,616 --> 01:22:06,856
[SPEAKER_29]: Great.

715
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:10,321
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's see, my next page.

716
01:22:11,923 --> 01:22:15,065
[SPEAKER_29]: So I talked about foreshadowing the people whose jobs were cutting.

717
01:22:15,385 --> 01:22:22,290
[SPEAKER_12]: We hadn't looked at those for cuts, but we still have a budget gap to look at.

718
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:31,056
[SPEAKER_12]: So of course, the question is how are we going to reduce that 2.7 down to zero?

719
01:22:31,156 --> 01:22:39,682
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just gave a group of positions that we didn't intend to,

720
01:22:41,519 --> 01:22:48,801
[SPEAKER_12]: but everything would have to be on the table for a round two of cuts.

721
01:22:49,861 --> 01:22:53,242
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

722
01:22:53,302 --> 01:23:02,524
[SPEAKER_29]: Individuals that are being cut as in directors, how do we know if they're cut, someone's not necessarily replacing them, correct?

723
01:23:02,604 --> 01:23:02,964
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

724
01:23:03,284 --> 01:23:03,564
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

725
01:23:04,144 --> 01:23:07,765
[SPEAKER_29]: So how do we know that the people are gonna step in and do their job are qualified to do it?

726
01:23:08,564 --> 01:23:12,446
[SPEAKER_29]: because it's gonna be someone under where the director was originally.

727
01:23:12,826 --> 01:23:15,868
[SPEAKER_29]: So how do we know that they're qualified to make the decisions?

728
01:23:15,968 --> 01:23:22,951
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a whole, well, the administrators all have their administrative certification.

729
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:32,056
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm trying to think, I mean, everybody has kind of an area of expertise, but- But they don't have the certification.

730
01:23:33,096 --> 01:23:36,318
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't know if there are, you know,

731
01:23:38,067 --> 01:23:45,014
[SPEAKER_12]: certification requirements outside of the general administrative certification for the positions we have.

732
01:23:45,074 --> 01:23:49,599
[SPEAKER_12]: So they should be able to be an administrator, you know.

733
01:23:51,354 --> 01:23:53,035
[SPEAKER_12]: in any of our programs.

734
01:23:54,655 --> 01:23:58,036
[SPEAKER_12]: Some are gonna be better than others in certain programs.

735
01:23:58,597 --> 01:23:59,477
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't deny that.

736
01:24:01,018 --> 01:24:17,924
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's a whole process once the budget gets passed, where we have to sit down with our unions and kind of figure it out collectively, how we're gonna implement these reductions and who, what are the seniority lists and how will we,

737
01:24:19,969 --> 01:24:21,190
[SPEAKER_12]: reorganize the work.

738
01:24:22,531 --> 01:24:25,713
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's the process that will happen.

739
01:24:26,173 --> 01:24:32,798
[SPEAKER_29]: So basically, if you're the senior in that group, you're most likely going to absorb some of the work.

740
01:24:33,798 --> 01:24:34,038
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

741
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:37,941
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, that stinks.

742
01:24:39,342 --> 01:24:40,243
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's see, what else?

743
01:24:40,503 --> 01:24:41,363
[SPEAKER_12]: The whole thing stinks.

744
01:24:41,663 --> 01:24:42,224
[SPEAKER_29]: It really does.

745
01:24:42,964 --> 01:24:45,346
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, I can totally agree with you on that.

746
01:24:47,661 --> 01:24:48,402
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's see.

747
01:24:48,962 --> 01:24:51,123
[SPEAKER_29]: The director, we talked about that.

748
01:24:51,863 --> 01:24:52,984
[SPEAKER_29]: We talked about that.

749
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:56,745
[SPEAKER_29]: Consultants, how many consultants do we have working for us?

750
01:25:00,867 --> 01:25:03,068
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this the $120,000 proposal?

751
01:25:03,828 --> 01:25:04,048
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

752
01:25:04,388 --> 01:25:05,009
[SPEAKER_29]: Or anybody else?

753
01:25:05,029 --> 01:25:11,111
[SPEAKER_12]: There's not a lot of them.

754
01:25:11,171 --> 01:25:14,393
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we use services for E-rate.

755
01:25:17,868 --> 01:25:19,431
[SPEAKER_12]: take advantage of E-rate funds.

756
01:25:21,974 --> 01:25:25,780
[SPEAKER_12]: We have consultants that do Medicaid reimbursement.

757
01:25:30,867 --> 01:25:32,169
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, any of our

758
01:25:36,547 --> 01:25:39,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Trying to think, you know, in the technology area.

759
01:25:39,209 --> 01:25:43,171
[SPEAKER_29]: Get a list, if we can have a list of who is a consultant.

760
01:25:43,452 --> 01:25:43,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

761
01:25:45,833 --> 01:25:47,735
[SPEAKER_29]: Are there any cuts in assistant principals?

762
01:25:48,875 --> 01:25:49,055
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

763
01:25:50,056 --> 01:25:51,437
[SPEAKER_29]: So no assistant principals will be cut?

764
01:25:51,877 --> 01:25:52,057
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

765
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:53,859
[SPEAKER_29]: Across the board?

766
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:56,400
[SPEAKER_12]: Across the board, as of today.

767
01:26:00,103 --> 01:26:00,583
[SPEAKER_29]: Jerry.

768
01:26:00,663 --> 01:26:02,484
[SPEAKER_12]: We still have 2.7, we have to deal with it.

769
01:26:02,524 --> 01:26:04,486
[SPEAKER_29]: You're messing with me now, come on.

770
01:26:06,206 --> 01:26:25,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, listen, I don't think, I think assistant principals are very important, just for, you know, our principals are often at meetings, out of the building, somebody has to be in charge of the building in case of an emergency.

771
01:26:25,878 --> 01:26:26,478
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

772
01:26:26,878 --> 01:26:29,180
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm with you on that.

773
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:29,960
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, I can't,

774
01:26:32,418 --> 01:26:39,864
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, I'll just use Mr. Tucci as an example, because I always say I've been Tucci-fied, because I'm at my sixth year at the McGlynn Elementary School.

775
01:26:39,884 --> 01:26:41,265
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm gonna miss it terribly next year.

776
01:26:42,186 --> 01:26:44,708
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't think the man takes a day off.

777
01:26:45,549 --> 01:26:46,790
[SPEAKER_29]: I think he's- Yeah, he's very good.

778
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:51,213
[SPEAKER_29]: He's exemplary, as are all of our principals.

779
01:26:52,795 --> 01:26:55,197
[SPEAKER_29]: But I can't imagine not having an assistant principal.

780
01:26:55,217 --> 01:26:56,918
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I agree, I agree.

781
01:26:57,298 --> 01:26:58,599
[SPEAKER_29]: And especially at the high school,

782
01:27:01,305 --> 01:27:04,366
[SPEAKER_29]: Have we decided on any cuts in the central administration office?

783
01:27:05,786 --> 01:27:05,946
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

784
01:27:06,786 --> 01:27:07,027
[SPEAKER_29]: None?

785
01:27:07,667 --> 01:27:07,867
[SPEAKER_12]: None.

786
01:27:08,067 --> 01:27:08,527
[SPEAKER_29]: Not one.

787
01:27:18,571 --> 01:27:19,951
[SPEAKER_12]: The staffing is pretty lean.

788
01:27:20,971 --> 01:27:21,452
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm sorry?

789
01:27:21,752 --> 01:27:23,472
[SPEAKER_12]: The staffing is pretty lean.

790
01:27:25,533 --> 01:27:27,114
[SPEAKER_29]: I think all our staffing is lean.

791
01:27:27,254 --> 01:27:27,374
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

792
01:27:28,565 --> 01:27:30,105
[SPEAKER_12]: but some are leaner than others.

793
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:33,246
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, I'm gonna stop.

794
01:27:33,526 --> 01:27:34,707
[SPEAKER_29]: So I just have one other question.

795
01:27:35,047 --> 01:27:38,648
[SPEAKER_29]: The raise that we received as school committee members, where did that, what was that funding from again?

796
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:41,949
[SPEAKER_12]: The budget, school budget.

797
01:27:42,409 --> 01:27:42,829
[SPEAKER_29]: Our raise?

798
01:27:43,589 --> 01:27:43,829
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

799
01:27:44,289 --> 01:27:45,570
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, there's no more money in there?

800
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:46,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Pardon?

801
01:27:46,570 --> 01:27:48,931
[SPEAKER_29]: Is there no more money in there that we could use any of that for this?

802
01:27:49,831 --> 01:27:51,771
[SPEAKER_29]: Because it seemed really easy for us to get our raises.

803
01:28:02,455 --> 01:28:05,839
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's entirely up to the school committee.

804
01:28:08,823 --> 01:28:12,607
[SPEAKER_12]: Those stipends have not been increased for a long time.

805
01:28:12,627 --> 01:28:13,288
[SPEAKER_12]: True.

806
01:28:13,569 --> 01:28:19,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Other staffing, certainly the last couple of years there's been

807
01:28:20,836 --> 01:28:26,378
[SPEAKER_12]: efforts made by the school committee to address salary concerns of the unions.

808
01:28:27,339 --> 01:28:42,385
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't think what was proposed is outrageous and it does, it's not that much money to kind of contribute to the problem, but if the stipends- I think every cent contributes to the problem, right?

809
01:28:42,405 --> 01:28:49,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, if the stipends were reduced, that would be added to the pot to deal with the remaining funding gap.

810
01:28:55,185 --> 01:28:56,506
[SPEAKER_29]: Lucky for you, I'm all done.

811
01:28:57,247 --> 01:28:57,708
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

812
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:01,512
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't disagree with a lot of what you said.

813
01:29:01,932 --> 01:29:10,581
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm not trying to be cranky, but obviously this hurts.

814
01:29:10,661 --> 01:29:11,802
[SPEAKER_29]: My children are in this district.

815
01:29:12,843 --> 01:29:13,984
[SPEAKER_29]: My family's in this district.

816
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:16,461
[SPEAKER_29]: This, this is our family.

817
01:29:16,481 --> 01:29:19,682
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, this is our community these the people that go home into our neighborhoods.

818
01:29:20,102 --> 01:29:22,723
[SPEAKER_29]: These are the kids that stand in front of my house and for the best every single morning.

819
01:29:23,003 --> 01:29:24,243
[SPEAKER_29]: These are the people that pay taxes.

820
01:29:24,864 --> 01:29:30,426
[SPEAKER_29]: And so it's, it's just so frustrating to me because I think when you work in a school.

821
01:29:31,266 --> 01:29:34,328
[SPEAKER_29]: you have such a different perspective of what's happening day to day.

822
01:29:34,569 --> 01:29:44,677
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm no expert, I'm no expert at all, but I think it definitely gives you a bird's eye view of really what is happening on the ground.

823
01:29:44,857 --> 01:29:56,926
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think, you know, I'm sure we have plenty of people here that would like to speak and I really encourage everybody to speak and to write emails and to send letters because this is a priority.

824
01:29:57,327 --> 01:29:58,488
[SPEAKER_29]: So thank you very much.

825
01:30:08,163 --> 01:30:09,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

826
01:30:10,065 --> 01:30:13,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Jerry, for putting this together and very transparent.

827
01:30:14,029 --> 01:30:19,795
[SPEAKER_07]: While I don't agree with, you know, all these cuts that we're doing, I really appreciate being able to see where we are.

828
01:30:19,835 --> 01:30:20,896
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not a lot of guessing.

829
01:30:20,936 --> 01:30:21,877
[SPEAKER_07]: We can actually see it.

830
01:30:24,473 --> 01:30:25,594
[SPEAKER_07]: I am very new to this.

831
01:30:26,235 --> 01:30:28,077
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been in two months to the day.

832
01:30:29,137 --> 01:30:35,363
[SPEAKER_07]: So my apologies if my ignorance or my lack of understanding precedes what I'm about to sort of talk about.

833
01:30:36,124 --> 01:30:37,585
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the only way you can learn it.

834
01:30:37,825 --> 01:30:38,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

835
01:30:38,245 --> 01:30:39,807
[SPEAKER_07]: I dive into the deep end.

836
01:30:40,567 --> 01:30:42,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Thought possible two and a half million deficit.

837
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:43,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's 250.

838
01:30:44,391 --> 01:30:46,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Like diving in the deep end real hard right now.

839
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:49,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Some emails that I've gotten

840
01:30:49,535 --> 01:30:54,498
[SPEAKER_07]: in particular are around performing arts, athletics, nurses.

841
01:30:55,499 --> 01:30:58,381
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought, I guess these are more comments than questions.

842
01:30:59,721 --> 01:31:01,963
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I wish I knew how to find the money.

843
01:31:02,163 --> 01:31:03,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I understood that, but I just don't.

844
01:31:04,084 --> 01:31:08,647
[SPEAKER_07]: So I apologize if I'm not giving too many solutions, just more of the concerns that I have.

845
01:31:09,667 --> 01:31:15,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Performing arts is on a decline, and by cutting that, I'm really nervous about the direction we go.

846
01:31:15,489 --> 01:31:17,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Performing arts aren't just an activity.

847
01:31:17,369 --> 01:31:24,011
[SPEAKER_07]: It is how we integrate culture, how we keep tradition, how we keep things alive in the city.

848
01:31:24,231 --> 01:31:29,993
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, we just had a great performance from our drama club with Mama Mia, and also just some other initiatives.

849
01:31:30,033 --> 01:31:35,914
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we're seeing them give back to the community in ways that, you know, I couldn't even have imagined when I was at Medford High.

850
01:31:35,934 --> 01:31:38,235
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really...

851
01:31:39,807 --> 01:31:50,234
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we just named the office after, you know, former school committee member, Lita DiGianto-Masso, and I'm afraid by going down this path, we're sort of going back what she was fighting against.

852
01:31:51,535 --> 01:32:00,881
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the performing arts are a huge staple to how we keep the users of our schools there.

853
01:32:01,461 --> 01:32:06,664
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of, what was I talking about, nurses, I was a student with,

854
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:09,312
[SPEAKER_07]: medication that had to be stored.

855
01:32:09,352 --> 01:32:15,961
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the things that I think I am not seeing sort of brought up is also, you know, we cut nurses, we're also cutting the facts that

856
01:32:16,650 --> 01:32:21,792
[SPEAKER_07]: I even in the upper levels could not take my medication without a nurse being there.

857
01:32:22,713 --> 01:32:24,033
[SPEAKER_07]: That includes epinephrine.

858
01:32:24,154 --> 01:32:26,555
[SPEAKER_07]: If I don't carry an EpiPen on me, there's one stored there.

859
01:32:26,595 --> 01:32:42,202
[SPEAKER_07]: We need someone to be able to run around the maze that is Mephiti Complex to find someone who may need to administer it, as well as I need to find time out of my day to go and meet with one of those nurses, hoping there's one not helping another student to take the medication that allowed me to help me learn every single day.

860
01:32:43,123 --> 01:32:54,174
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's sort of one of the things that I just wanted to say in support of the nurses here and just wanted to give that insight because I'm not really seeing that being mentioned, but no one really sees that unless they experience it like I do.

861
01:32:54,194 --> 01:32:55,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

862
01:32:56,036 --> 01:33:01,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the complement of nurses at the high school is the same as it is this year.

863
01:33:01,922 --> 01:33:02,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

864
01:33:02,532 --> 01:33:04,512
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just, it's not even just the high school, it's the elementary.

865
01:33:04,552 --> 01:33:08,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been taking medications since elementary school, um, elementary school, middle school and high school.

866
01:33:09,513 --> 01:33:11,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and so that, that doesn't really change.

867
01:33:11,434 --> 01:33:15,974
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was always packed to even back then when I was there in 2019.

868
01:33:16,455 --> 01:33:25,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I'm really, really concerned about how many, you know, employees were cutting, uh, in terms of athletics, um, that department in terms of it's already thin enough.

869
01:33:25,636 --> 01:33:29,917
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, I'm not sure what position was cut in the athletics department.

870
01:33:31,638 --> 01:33:33,019
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you run administrative?

871
01:33:33,299 --> 01:33:34,039
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the administrative?

872
01:33:34,319 --> 01:33:36,440
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the assistant athletic director.

873
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:41,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the assistant athletic director that I know that's in there is like the backbone of that entire athletics department.

874
01:33:42,582 --> 01:34:00,048
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is no diss to anyone in that department at all, but the individual who is in that is at everything I've ever been to and is there to make sure that that program stays running.

875
01:34:00,676 --> 01:34:07,639
[SPEAKER_07]: So really looking at, you know, it's numbers but it's also people and support, and who are they going to lean on if they're the ones there all the time anyways.

876
01:34:08,659 --> 01:34:17,063
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in terms of, you know, looking at technology spending, we've sort of digged ourselves into this hole of relying on Chromebooks and technology because of the pandemic.

877
01:34:18,716 --> 01:34:28,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess when it comes to technology, as someone who's used that technology pre-pandemic, knowing how unreliable it can be, I'm a little concerned about pumping more money into it until we figure out a solution.

878
01:34:28,419 --> 01:34:31,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I feel like every other Chromebook had a missing key.

879
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:39,082
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, I'm a little concerned about putting so much money towards tablets for kindergartners instead of the support that they need to help teach those kindergartners.

880
01:34:47,236 --> 01:34:56,182
[SPEAKER_07]: hands-on learning tactile that, I mean, I'm not an educator, but I just happen to be a designer and an artist and know just the value of tactile hands-on learning.

881
01:34:56,682 --> 01:35:04,127
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would almost rather look, see that money, if that money had to go towards something, be more towards school supplies or hands-on learning than electronics.

882
01:35:04,167 --> 01:35:09,330
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know how that makes me sound, but I don't feel like our kindergartners need tablets, they need people.

883
01:35:11,112 --> 01:35:13,073
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's a lot of what I have to say.

884
01:35:13,193 --> 01:35:18,616
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a lot of things, obviously, you know, I'm happy to see more increase in special education services.

885
01:35:19,517 --> 01:35:26,120
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are a lot of alarming factors that I don't know if I fully wrapped my head around in the last 48 hours.

886
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:29,562
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, thank you to everyone who's here to speak on behalf.

887
01:35:29,602 --> 01:35:32,544
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sorry by taking up more of the time that doesn't allow you to.

888
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:38,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanna say that there's, I may have more questions or comments going on.

889
01:35:38,304 --> 01:35:40,106
[SPEAKER_07]: For now, that's what I have, so thank you.

890
01:35:40,706 --> 01:35:51,917
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I think one of the good things about trying to present the budget earlier than normal is that we do have some more time to discuss and ask questions.

891
01:35:52,457 --> 01:35:57,962
[SPEAKER_12]: I will say with the technology, there's a lot more use of instructional technology.

892
01:35:58,783 --> 01:36:05,105
[SPEAKER_12]: So the only way for students to access that is through some kind of a device.

893
01:36:05,985 --> 01:36:13,027
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, the old way was you'd have like four desktops in the corner of the room and you'd share that.

894
01:36:13,207 --> 01:36:21,149
[SPEAKER_12]: And now, you know, today that's, you know, it's just a different model from what we used to do.

895
01:36:23,490 --> 01:36:26,393
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's the type of thinking that we have to do right now.

896
01:36:26,633 --> 01:36:40,986
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't, if somebody wants to make a proposal that we're not gonna use tablets anymore and we're gonna hire another and that could fund another teacher, those are the types of trade-offs that we have to talk about.

897
01:36:41,546 --> 01:36:42,788
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would say that, you know,

898
01:36:44,454 --> 01:36:47,955
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, there's pluses and minuses to every idea.

899
01:36:48,035 --> 01:36:56,079
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you say, let's scrap instructional technology at the elementary school, you're gonna have a different set of people in the audience.

900
01:36:56,839 --> 01:37:01,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, and I think, I'm sorry, just a point of clarification, I guess on my point, is it to cut technology?

901
01:37:01,321 --> 01:37:06,142
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more to look at and consult our users who are administering it to see where they might find it best.

902
01:37:06,463 --> 01:37:08,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we need to invest more in technology?

903
01:37:08,363 --> 01:37:12,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a teaching degree, so I don't really know what that is like, but.

904
01:37:13,625 --> 01:37:21,507
[SPEAKER_07]: definitely leaning more on our professionals that are our faculty to see where there are technological gaps and fixes on a day-to-day classroom basis.

905
01:37:21,527 --> 01:37:23,848
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for the clarification as well.

906
01:37:24,108 --> 01:37:25,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, appreciate the work.

907
01:37:28,689 --> 01:37:29,309
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Jerry.

908
01:37:29,329 --> 01:37:34,131
[SPEAKER_20]: I think, oh sorry, member Olapoday.

909
01:37:34,151 --> 01:37:39,072
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll actually yield my time to our student representative if they have a question briefly.

910
01:37:48,483 --> 01:37:50,984
[SPEAKER_36]: I just wanted to ask a follow-up question.

911
01:37:51,024 --> 01:38:03,111
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm not sure, I may have missed it in Member Bransley's questions, but if the secretary positions are being cut at the McGlynn and other schools,

912
01:38:04,751 --> 01:38:29,899
[SPEAKER_36]: I just wanted to ask a question if, because I'm not sure, it may have been clarified already, if APs were on the, being considered for being cut, because if the workload is being put onto the secretaries, I may be mistaken, but for the McGlynn, it's roughly, for the elementary school alone, it's 500 students per one secretary, and at the high school, based on the cuts proposed, it's gonna be 600 students per secretary, so if AP,

913
01:38:32,256 --> 01:38:37,445
[SPEAKER_36]: AP assistant principals are cut in the future, then who's going to do the workload?

914
01:38:37,485 --> 01:38:40,189
[SPEAKER_36]: Because the workload from the secretary is going to go down to the AP unit.

915
01:38:40,570 --> 01:38:42,453
[SPEAKER_36]: If that works, someone's got to do the work.

916
01:38:46,263 --> 01:38:49,865
[SPEAKER_12]: we are not proposing any cuts to our assistant principal ranks.

917
01:38:50,985 --> 01:38:59,530
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't foresee, I foresee that remaining even as we go through more budget cuts.

918
01:39:00,370 --> 01:39:07,574
[SPEAKER_12]: But just with the caveat that $2.7 million is a lot of money to come up with.

919
01:39:09,775 --> 01:39:14,437
[SPEAKER_12]: But I totally agree with you on assistant principals there.

920
01:39:14,657 --> 01:39:15,158
[SPEAKER_12]: The schools,

921
01:39:16,482 --> 01:39:21,848
[SPEAKER_12]: can only run when there's a team leadership team in place and those include the assistant principals.

922
01:39:21,868 --> 01:39:27,634
[SPEAKER_19]: Remember all about it.

923
01:39:28,055 --> 01:39:32,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and thank you Mister McHugh for being here and being as I think transparent as we've all like you to be.

924
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:34,462
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only go through this process.

925
01:39:34,932 --> 01:39:37,253
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, like my colleagues, have a handful of questions.

926
01:39:37,573 --> 01:39:51,896
[SPEAKER_00]: So on slide 14, the question about special education in district programming that we do, do we have an idea or data on our neighbors and how they deal with in-program versus out-of-city program and what that looks like for us?

927
01:39:53,957 --> 01:39:55,977
[SPEAKER_12]: I could discuss that with the director.

928
01:39:57,398 --> 01:40:01,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Each community handles it differently because

929
01:40:04,349 --> 01:40:06,271
[SPEAKER_12]: The students are very different.

930
01:40:06,392 --> 01:40:16,363
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I worked in Chelsea, we have a lot more students outplaced because of, and it's all based on the needs of the students.

931
01:40:16,644 --> 01:40:19,387
[SPEAKER_12]: First of all, we don't have the capacity in our schools

932
01:40:20,208 --> 01:40:22,670
[SPEAKER_12]: to extend programming.

933
01:40:23,671 --> 01:40:29,156
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a very, there's a robust in-district program for students with autism.

934
01:40:30,437 --> 01:40:39,205
[SPEAKER_12]: But when students, there's only so much therapeutic support that a school district can offer.

935
01:40:39,245 --> 01:40:43,289
[SPEAKER_12]: And sometimes students need

936
01:40:44,702 --> 01:40:51,544
[SPEAKER_12]: a placement that's more therapeutic with education rather than education with a therapeutic component.

937
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:57,805
[SPEAKER_12]: So oftentimes we have to look at outside providers to provide that education.

938
01:40:57,845 --> 01:41:04,926
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's all based on a instructional education program that's drafted with the parent and the teacher.

939
01:41:05,567 --> 01:41:07,647
[SPEAKER_12]: And that just spells out the requirements.

940
01:41:07,707 --> 01:41:10,388
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a contract that's in federal law that that,

941
01:41:12,307 --> 01:41:17,009
[SPEAKER_12]: those services, that type of educational model has to be provided.

942
01:41:17,689 --> 01:41:22,651
[SPEAKER_12]: If it can't be provided within the school, then look for outside placements to provide that education.

943
01:41:23,652 --> 01:41:24,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

944
01:41:24,332 --> 01:41:27,994
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on slide 18, one of the proposed savings initiatives.

945
01:41:29,955 --> 01:41:37,098
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm looking at the positions that are being reduced in the McGlynn, Missittuck, and the Roberts, for example, I think what I'm trying to understand is

946
01:41:38,499 --> 01:41:52,570
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're analyzing costs and we're comparing it to student and teacher preferences, you mentioned that earlier that you were deciding how we're going to kind of reduce some positions in other vocational arts, science, arts programs.

947
01:41:53,751 --> 01:41:54,612
[SPEAKER_00]: What takes priority?

948
01:41:54,992 --> 01:42:01,658
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we determine where we need to move money around or where we need to improve our costs, if that makes sense?

949
01:42:01,858 --> 01:42:01,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

950
01:42:03,544 --> 01:42:21,597
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we try to evaluate those, you know, based on some kind of criteria or standard so in elementary, it's a little bit easier to look at class size because students are basically typically in front of, you know, the same teacher for most of the day there's specialists that come in.

951
01:42:22,818 --> 01:42:42,391
[SPEAKER_12]: for prep period coverage and they might go to library or go to a music room for music and then when you get into the middle grades, it's really based on schedules, more so than than strictly class size so because of the variety of

952
01:42:44,973 --> 01:42:48,594
[SPEAKER_12]: instructional offerings that are offered at those grade levels.

953
01:42:48,674 --> 01:42:59,358
[SPEAKER_12]: So then you're looking at, you know, are you fully utilizing all of your teachers to support the program?

954
01:42:59,398 --> 01:43:03,500
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, it's nice to have extra teachers around.

955
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:04,520
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't deny that.

956
01:43:04,820 --> 01:43:05,521
[SPEAKER_12]: People are out.

957
01:43:06,201 --> 01:43:17,275
[SPEAKER_12]: you, you know, it's very disruptive when teacher calls in, you know, if they have, if they're sick, we don't want them to come in, we want them to stay at home.

958
01:43:18,877 --> 01:43:19,558
[SPEAKER_12]: And to have

959
01:43:20,965 --> 01:43:25,027
[SPEAKER_12]: extra teachers to be able to pick up that coverage is ideal.

960
01:43:26,507 --> 01:43:41,233
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's just that we're asking a lot of the school department budget to pay equitable salaries, to be offered health insurance with 15% co-pay.

961
01:43:44,474 --> 01:44:01,845
[SPEAKER_12]: to have all this programming and have sufficient staff so that nobody gets burnt out and everybody has a good work situation.

962
01:44:01,885 --> 01:44:06,068
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's just, we can't do that all.

963
01:44:07,669 --> 01:44:10,010
[SPEAKER_12]: Even, let's say we didn't have ESSA.

964
01:44:11,141 --> 01:44:11,681
[SPEAKER_12]: to deal with.

965
01:44:12,802 --> 01:44:14,764
[SPEAKER_12]: We didn't have any underfunded accounts.

966
01:44:16,265 --> 01:44:18,186
[SPEAKER_12]: We didn't require any new spending.

967
01:44:20,268 --> 01:44:26,612
[SPEAKER_12]: Our salary budgets went up by $4 million, and our city appropriation can only go up 2.3.

968
01:44:27,553 --> 01:44:37,500
[SPEAKER_12]: So even with all that said, the cuts that we're proposing would have to be made in order to fund what's required in those salaries.

969
01:44:41,757 --> 01:44:43,479
[SPEAKER_12]: we have to do the best we can.

970
01:44:43,719 --> 01:45:00,895
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish we weren't making any, we would probably make some based on class size, but we're reaching a tipping point.

971
01:45:01,616 --> 01:45:04,179
[SPEAKER_12]: And like I've told the superintendent many times,

972
01:45:05,814 --> 01:45:26,990
[SPEAKER_12]: While I'm here, Medford is not gonna be Brockton, and we're gonna get what it really costs to run the district, and if we don't have sufficient funds to meet those costs, then we have to, together, come to an agreement on what are the priorities in the budget.

973
01:45:27,910 --> 01:45:35,276
[SPEAKER_12]: And everything, we want everything to be a priority, but everything can't be a priority.

974
01:45:37,832 --> 01:45:45,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Another follow up question on slide 22 when we're talking about the administrative assistance and consolidation for a handful of those roles.

975
01:45:46,539 --> 01:46:09,971
[SPEAKER_00]: And member really mentioned this and I'm going to follow up saying when we're deciding how we're going to consolidate rules or how we're going to go through job descriptions for example are we speaking to the people in those positions currently to determine how we're going to consolidate if that's what we need to do or is it more so we're determining that based off of our expectation of what they're already doing and what we believe them to need to be doing.

976
01:46:12,468 --> 01:46:22,996
[SPEAKER_12]: We made some assumptions about what we could do and then those assumptions are vetted with the supervisors that are involved in those programs.

977
01:46:25,939 --> 01:46:27,400
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think my.

978
01:46:29,202 --> 01:46:32,044
[SPEAKER_12]: So you have to come up with some, you know,

979
01:46:35,711 --> 01:46:54,822
[SPEAKER_12]: When you're developing the budget, and you need, you don't have enough money and you have to start thinking about how do we reprioritize our budget, you have to generate as many ideas as you can, and then you have to go out and test those ideas to see if they're workable and, you know,

980
01:46:56,943 --> 01:46:58,963
[SPEAKER_12]: we could have made a mistake with a few of these.

981
01:46:59,904 --> 01:47:10,806
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we did, and we go forward with it, and we find out that what we had planned to do is not working out, then we will attempt to correct that.

982
01:47:12,447 --> 01:47:14,667
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my final comment would be to the end.

983
01:47:14,907 --> 01:47:25,150
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the voices of our educators here in the district are central in deciding these big decisions that we have.

984
01:47:25,190 --> 01:47:26,450
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's not,

985
01:47:27,526 --> 01:47:29,327
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that that's not happening, it's not happening enough.

986
01:47:30,268 --> 01:47:44,275
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we have an opportunity here to have a real conversation with each individual that's willing to speak with us as soon as possible, realistically, to decide how we're going to find the money that we need and how we're going to consolidate positions if that's what we need to do.

987
01:47:44,295 --> 01:47:47,677
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anyone in here wants to do that, obviously.

988
01:47:47,857 --> 01:47:48,457
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said,

989
01:47:50,723 --> 01:47:59,871
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're not talking to them before making assumptions, or we can do at the same time, let's say, I think we're not doing that we're starting we're starting off wrong.

990
01:48:00,339 --> 01:48:20,517
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're not opening up the conversation, I think properly so I would implore you and the rest of your team and I think the central administration to do that going forward so that when we have the final conversation about the budget and we vote, both as a city council and a school committee that we feel as though we've actually been informed from the people that are going to be filling up these roles and consolidate into them potentially.

991
01:48:20,758 --> 01:48:20,898
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

992
01:48:29,443 --> 01:48:39,411
[SPEAKER_12]: So I felt it was important to brief union leadership once we began to become aware of the

993
01:48:43,352 --> 01:48:47,134
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of significant budget problem that we're having.

994
01:48:47,194 --> 01:48:49,195
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was happy to do that.

995
01:48:49,235 --> 01:48:52,857
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to include them in kind of our thinking.

996
01:48:53,377 --> 01:49:08,144
[SPEAKER_12]: And then of course, we do have a requirement to meet with all the unions that are affected and kind of work out collaboratively on how we're gonna implement any cuts that are part of the FY25 budget.

997
01:49:10,319 --> 01:49:10,920
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.

998
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:14,367
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe the work that you've been doing, and I believe that you'll continue to do that.

999
01:49:14,407 --> 01:49:17,132
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say thank you for this, because this has been incredibly informative.

1000
01:49:17,533 --> 01:49:19,757
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1001
01:49:19,777 --> 01:49:19,957
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1002
01:49:21,141 --> 01:49:21,461
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1003
01:49:22,021 --> 01:49:24,382
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you for the best presentation I think I've had in seven years.

1004
01:49:25,402 --> 01:49:32,745
[SPEAKER_34]: The worst one at the same time, of course, but I understood it in a way that I feel like I've not understood our finances before.

1005
01:49:32,765 --> 01:49:33,825
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, good.

1006
01:49:34,105 --> 01:49:35,306
[SPEAKER_34]: That's just one of my goals.

1007
01:49:35,646 --> 01:49:41,748
[SPEAKER_34]: I wish it was a presentation about wonderful things and it was just as clear, but that's not what we got tonight.

1008
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:56,963
[SPEAKER_34]: In last year at this time, I was on a little bit of a rant about how every single year on page eight, you have this correction to all of our fake spending.

1009
01:49:57,083 --> 01:50:07,846
[SPEAKER_34]: So in every budget that I've been through, we would say that homeless transportation was 100,000, even though it was 500, 600,000 the year before, because we had to get to the number.

1010
01:50:08,606 --> 01:50:12,787
[SPEAKER_34]: So we would put a number in the budget that was completely a lie and everybody knew it.

1011
01:50:13,647 --> 01:50:18,351
[SPEAKER_34]: And last year I ranted because we had the, what did we spend in the previous year?

1012
01:50:18,431 --> 01:50:19,592
[SPEAKER_34]: What were we actually budgeting?

1013
01:50:19,832 --> 01:50:23,355
[SPEAKER_34]: And they were, it was like no other thing I've ever seen.

1014
01:50:23,375 --> 01:50:35,784
[SPEAKER_34]: Like to see us spending 1.1 million and then budgeting 250,000, it was really kind of like, and I was ranting, I'm like, here we are, next year we're gonna be in the same exact spot.

1015
01:50:35,804 --> 01:50:39,647
[SPEAKER_34]: So you made me a bit of a, I'm glad to be wrong for the first time on that.

1016
01:50:40,888 --> 01:50:42,249
[SPEAKER_34]: Unfortunately, that does mean that

1017
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:48,738
[SPEAKER_34]: the budget is reflecting actual expenses, which everybody can agree is what we would want.

1018
01:50:49,098 --> 01:50:56,681
[SPEAKER_34]: It's just, that means that we can't, this budget does not represent a fantasy so that we can get to the number in the city.

1019
01:50:57,302 --> 01:51:00,783
[SPEAKER_34]: And I greatly appreciate that as hard as that has made this.

1020
01:51:01,383 --> 01:51:06,585
[SPEAKER_12]: You just reminded me of another aspect of with the salary increases.

1021
01:51:06,645 --> 01:51:10,787
[SPEAKER_12]: So some of those contracts that were settled in this fiscal year,

1022
01:51:12,233 --> 01:51:14,919
[SPEAKER_12]: went back to fiscal year 22.

1023
01:51:16,001 --> 01:51:22,335
[SPEAKER_12]: So the first year of the new contract was fiscal year 22, which meant that in the budget for 24,

1024
01:51:23,595 --> 01:51:28,017
[SPEAKER_12]: the salaries were based on fiscal year 21 salaries.

1025
01:51:28,757 --> 01:51:46,284
[SPEAKER_12]: So the salary increase is a little outsized what it would typically be because those budgets, not only have we met our obligations this year, what we owed employees, but we then have to adjust budgets from 21 to 25 in one fiscal year.

1026
01:51:51,474 --> 01:51:56,417
[SPEAKER_12]: There were a couple of unions that had that amount of retroactivity.

1027
01:51:56,837 --> 01:52:06,163
[SPEAKER_34]: And we still have the custodial contract to settle, which would be 2021 through 2024, and additional for the next coming year.

1028
01:52:06,183 --> 01:52:09,725
[SPEAKER_12]: So whatever that comes to- But we've accounted for that in this budget.

1029
01:52:09,885 --> 01:52:10,846
[SPEAKER_34]: Right.

1030
01:52:11,446 --> 01:52:14,408
[SPEAKER_34]: And I think there's a couple of things I just want to say about budgeting that

1031
01:52:15,697 --> 01:52:16,578
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm going to go back to the

1032
01:52:23,866 --> 01:52:28,708
[SPEAKER_34]: option to have a penny of additional spending outside of an identified revenue source.

1033
01:52:30,268 --> 01:52:51,615
[SPEAKER_34]: But there's this other thing, when we're talking about this undistributed salaries, because we're in the middle of negotiations, if we set aside $600,000 for what may be the cost to settle a contract, and then we don't have it settled before the end of the fiscal year, all that money just flows right back to the city, and then the following year,

1034
01:52:54,262 --> 01:53:00,508
[SPEAKER_34]: the smart accounting would be whatever you think you need for this year, plus the 600,000, because you're going to still need that.

1035
01:53:00,708 --> 01:53:05,493
[SPEAKER_34]: And we've had years where we would have $1.5 million set aside for contracts.

1036
01:53:05,873 --> 01:53:07,295
[SPEAKER_34]: We wouldn't finish the contracts.

1037
01:53:07,435 --> 01:53:08,676
[SPEAKER_34]: We would send it back to the city.

1038
01:53:09,016 --> 01:53:10,437
[SPEAKER_34]: And the following year, we budgeted $250,000.

1039
01:53:10,478 --> 01:53:11,639
[SPEAKER_34]: There's no world where that math makes sense.

1040
01:53:17,102 --> 01:53:23,243
[SPEAKER_34]: That problem, some of that problem can be solved by the school committee getting contracts done on time, which we are working very hard on.

1041
01:53:24,615 --> 01:53:30,879
[SPEAKER_34]: But it creates this very lopsided thing when you look at our budgeted allocations.

1042
01:53:31,199 --> 01:53:34,181
[SPEAKER_34]: So the budget goes up $1.5 million.

1043
01:53:34,702 --> 01:53:35,562
[SPEAKER_34]: We didn't even spend it.

1044
01:53:35,622 --> 01:53:36,983
[SPEAKER_34]: It went back to the city.

1045
01:53:37,504 --> 01:53:46,130
[SPEAKER_34]: And then the next year we got, whatever the increase was, it doesn't tell you the story because that was money for three years ago contracts.

1046
01:53:46,690 --> 01:53:51,934
[SPEAKER_34]: So when we look at that graph that shows percentage increases year over year, it is a,

1047
01:53:55,447 --> 01:53:59,088
[SPEAKER_34]: It's not that it's not important, but it does not mean really what it says it means.

1048
01:54:00,249 --> 01:54:08,492
[SPEAKER_34]: And even if we were to do one of actual expenses year over year, well, in this year, if we paid three years of contracts, that's this year's expense.

1049
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:12,873
[SPEAKER_34]: So it looks like we spent way more, but it's really settling contracts from years ago.

1050
01:54:12,953 --> 01:54:18,215
[SPEAKER_34]: So all those numbers are very, very funny, frankly.

1051
01:54:18,775 --> 01:54:23,577
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I have to give a note of thanks to the city finance director.

1052
01:54:25,578 --> 01:54:47,587
[SPEAKER_12]: A couple of months ago, we did have unspent balances in our FY23 budget, and I was able to work something out with him where some of the retroactivity for the administrator's contract could be

1053
01:54:48,450 --> 01:54:50,752
[SPEAKER_12]: legitimately charged to the 23 budget.

1054
01:54:50,872 --> 01:54:56,016
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you recall, I had some concerns about finishing this year in the red.

1055
01:54:56,057 --> 01:55:02,422
[SPEAKER_12]: So that actually helped us with our balanced budget for this year.

1056
01:55:02,842 --> 01:55:06,145
[SPEAKER_34]: I wish we could keep it open for as many years as we have outstanding contracts.

1057
01:55:06,826 --> 01:55:09,668
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm gonna just go through my list.

1058
01:55:09,708 --> 01:55:13,171
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you for my colleagues who've answered some of the, have asked some of the questions already.

1059
01:55:14,815 --> 01:55:18,155
[SPEAKER_34]: In the enrollment trends, how many of the

1060
01:55:20,856 --> 01:55:23,077
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm slightly confused on the kindergarten situation.

1061
01:55:23,137 --> 01:55:35,639
[SPEAKER_34]: So this year we had to add some kindergarten classes because we had some like literally August and September, like, I don't wanna say onslaught, that sounds terrible, but like an awful lot more registrants than we expected.

1062
01:55:36,159 --> 01:55:38,159
[SPEAKER_34]: And so we added those kindergarten teachers.

1063
01:55:38,599 --> 01:55:42,860
[SPEAKER_34]: Now we are not expecting that number to go down in the fall.

1064
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:47,221
[SPEAKER_34]: Are we not including those kindergarten teachers in this budget?

1065
01:55:47,981 --> 01:55:56,367
[SPEAKER_34]: And then we're just gonna over the summer as a registration makes it too much for the current in for the kept kindergarten teachers, we're just going to go hire new kindergarten teachers.

1066
01:55:57,048 --> 01:55:57,548
[SPEAKER_34]: That's the plan.

1067
01:56:00,598 --> 01:56:10,625
[SPEAKER_12]: With the staff that we're funding in the budget, if the enrollment projections hold, then we'll have sufficient number of kindergarten teachers.

1068
01:56:11,806 --> 01:56:21,632
[SPEAKER_12]: If the enrollment growth exceeds that, then we're gonna have to look, we may have to add one or more teachers to that kindergarten.

1069
01:56:22,012 --> 01:56:22,853
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you.

1070
01:56:22,873 --> 01:56:24,694
[SPEAKER_34]: I was just slightly confused on how that was working.

1071
01:56:26,420 --> 01:56:30,422
[SPEAKER_34]: On page 13, we have four literacy coaches.

1072
01:56:30,482 --> 01:56:31,662
[SPEAKER_34]: We are not continuing.

1073
01:56:31,882 --> 01:56:32,862
[SPEAKER_34]: They were actually vacant.

1074
01:56:34,443 --> 01:56:37,304
[SPEAKER_34]: My question is, so do we have any literacy coaches at all?

1075
01:56:38,104 --> 01:56:38,805
[SPEAKER_34]: Unfortunately, no.

1076
01:56:38,845 --> 01:56:45,367
[SPEAKER_34]: We have zero literacy coaches as we have focused on literacy for five straight years.

1077
01:56:45,587 --> 01:56:48,948
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh, I see the assistant superintendent saying we actually have one.

1078
01:56:48,968 --> 01:56:49,469
[SPEAKER_34]: We have one.

1079
01:56:49,489 --> 01:56:49,549
Two.

1080
01:56:50,909 --> 01:56:55,811
Five.

1081
01:56:57,878 --> 01:57:05,042
[SPEAKER_06]: My apologies, we have one literacy coach who's housed at both of the Title I buildings, the Missittuck and the McGlynn.

1082
01:57:06,483 --> 01:57:07,083
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you very much.

1083
01:57:07,823 --> 01:57:10,825
[SPEAKER_06]: And just for clarification, so it's part of the Title I budget.

1084
01:57:11,225 --> 01:57:11,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1085
01:57:11,505 --> 01:57:13,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Her salary is paid out of the Title I budget.

1086
01:57:13,386 --> 01:57:13,647
[SPEAKER_34]: Correct.

1087
01:57:13,887 --> 01:57:14,227
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1088
01:57:15,067 --> 01:57:24,793
[SPEAKER_34]: On page 14, member Olopade had brought up, I think he was bringing up like, you know,

1089
01:57:25,993 --> 01:57:42,086
[SPEAKER_34]: Special Education Services, and I'm the Medford representative, I'm the chair of the Shore Educational Collaboratives Board of Directors, and you know, and actually it's like, it feels like it's actually just the Chelsea special ed department, because it's like,

1090
01:57:43,107 --> 01:57:47,691
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't know, two-thirds or maybe even three-quarters of all of the SHORE students are actually from Chelsea.

1091
01:57:48,091 --> 01:57:51,714
[SPEAKER_34]: And of course, SHORE is in Chelsea, so that's probably not a coincidence.

1092
01:57:52,654 --> 01:58:00,060
[SPEAKER_34]: But when we're in our SHORE meetings, we have talked about how districts come to SHORE seeking assistance.

1093
01:58:01,121 --> 01:58:05,484
[SPEAKER_34]: And there are a number of types of specialists, for instance, that are truly unicorns.

1094
01:58:05,644 --> 01:58:07,586
[SPEAKER_34]: I believe there's some for the blind that are like,

1095
01:58:08,046 --> 01:58:09,907
[SPEAKER_34]: you know, there's like two in the state or something.

1096
01:58:10,767 --> 01:58:19,852
[SPEAKER_34]: And so when we think about in-district services versus out-of-district services, cost is always an issue, but sometimes cost is not the issue at all.

1097
01:58:20,412 --> 01:58:32,037
[SPEAKER_34]: And I know Shore just hired somebody and I forget her title, but she does something that like all the districts around are very excited because they need those services for a student.

1098
01:58:32,378 --> 01:58:34,759
[SPEAKER_34]: So like, it would make no sense to hire this person full-time.

1099
01:58:35,379 --> 01:58:37,300
[SPEAKER_34]: to serve one student.

1100
01:58:37,740 --> 01:58:39,240
[SPEAKER_34]: And there are very few of them.

1101
01:58:39,321 --> 01:58:45,083
[SPEAKER_34]: So we will be getting that service from SHORE, and they will employ that person.

1102
01:58:45,143 --> 01:58:48,104
[SPEAKER_34]: So it's very complicated.

1103
01:58:48,244 --> 01:58:52,946
[SPEAKER_34]: I believe Chelsea also has space constraints for their special ed students.

1104
01:58:53,066 --> 01:59:00,929
[SPEAKER_34]: So there's a lot of reasons to do things in district, a lot of reasons to do things out of district, and certainly the least restrictive environment is important.

1105
01:59:01,069 --> 01:59:04,270
[SPEAKER_34]: But a least restrictive environment for which you can't actually provide the services

1106
01:59:05,670 --> 01:59:08,552
[SPEAKER_34]: Well, that's, I don't know what to say about that.

1107
01:59:08,632 --> 01:59:20,037
[SPEAKER_34]: But if you literally cannot hire a person to do the services that are necessary for a student to progress, then, you know, that's sort of a tough spot to be in, so.

1108
01:59:20,437 --> 01:59:24,299
[SPEAKER_12]: And collaborators are different than out-of-district placements.

1109
01:59:24,359 --> 01:59:27,821
[SPEAKER_12]: Collaborators are viewed as, you know, part of the school community.

1110
01:59:28,541 --> 01:59:30,422
[SPEAKER_12]: And the idea was, you know, why should

1111
01:59:32,073 --> 01:59:48,427
[SPEAKER_12]: can school districts be fighting over the three or four teachers that can actually do that program when you can have a collaborative to hire those teachers and every school system can access those services.

1112
01:59:48,488 --> 01:59:55,614
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's really viewed as part of public school, I'd say more so than out-of-district placements.

1113
01:59:56,094 --> 02:00:03,821
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, they are meant for public school students, although I know that some, I believe most of those district placements are also students of the district that form.

1114
02:00:03,841 --> 02:00:05,142
[SPEAKER_12]: But I know it's a little different.

1115
02:00:05,162 --> 02:00:06,263
[SPEAKER_12]: They are our students.

1116
02:00:06,283 --> 02:00:13,069
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have a requirement to oversee the implementation of the IEPs at those placements.

1117
02:00:14,410 --> 02:00:15,210
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1118
02:00:17,492 --> 02:00:17,813
[SPEAKER_34]: Page 15.

1119
02:00:17,933 --> 02:00:18,253
[SPEAKER_34]: Wait.

1120
02:00:23,513 --> 02:00:34,417
[SPEAKER_34]: You know, this issue of the two new positions for HR or payroll, you know, in my seven years, I have asked for more reports than is probably reasonable.

1121
02:00:34,737 --> 02:00:35,958
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay, it's definitely reasonable.

1122
02:00:36,938 --> 02:00:43,080
[SPEAKER_34]: And I'll go out on a limb and say 90% of those reports are not things that we can get.

1123
02:00:43,601 --> 02:00:44,621
[SPEAKER_34]: They're questions like,

1124
02:00:45,694 --> 02:00:46,995
[SPEAKER_34]: How much are we spending on overtime?

1125
02:00:47,515 --> 02:00:54,419
[SPEAKER_34]: And Medford, both in the city and in the schools, does not have a modern information system for their finances.

1126
02:00:54,719 --> 02:00:59,782
[SPEAKER_34]: So Munis, which is just one company, but it's the one most people have, is very expensive.

1127
02:00:59,822 --> 02:01:01,243
[SPEAKER_34]: A year ago, I believe it was a year ago.

1128
02:01:01,443 --> 02:01:02,124
[SPEAKER_34]: Maybe it was two.

1129
02:01:02,584 --> 02:01:03,464
[SPEAKER_34]: We had a presentation.

1130
02:01:03,484 --> 02:01:07,767
[SPEAKER_34]: It was going to be $1.7 million to implement in Medford public schools alone.

1131
02:01:09,850 --> 02:01:17,614
[SPEAKER_34]: And that would be a capital expense and a massive training effort for a number of staff and like a 18 month project.

1132
02:01:18,115 --> 02:01:18,935
[SPEAKER_34]: So we don't have that.

1133
02:01:19,035 --> 02:01:32,242
[SPEAKER_34]: So a lot of times we ask questions so that we can talk about efficiencies or the direction of the district or lots of other questions for which you need payroll or HR information for which the answer is you just can't have it.

1134
02:01:33,583 --> 02:01:37,625
[SPEAKER_34]: Because we're not gonna have like a staff member and especially in a lightly staffed department

1135
02:01:38,214 --> 02:01:42,197
[SPEAKER_34]: spend weeks and weeks pouring over data to type up a spreadsheet for you.

1136
02:01:42,397 --> 02:01:46,899
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, you can do that if you have tons of staff, but then you probably would just have mutants if you have that kind of money.

1137
02:01:47,500 --> 02:02:01,288
[SPEAKER_34]: So I'm very grateful for this because every time we have an increase for teachers or anybody, any other of our union partners and we settle it, and then two and a half months later, they haven't gotten their retro pay.

1138
02:02:02,449 --> 02:02:07,232
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, the new members haven't had this experience yet, but we get lots of emails as if you all are just like on vacation.

1139
02:02:07,947 --> 02:02:22,037
[SPEAKER_34]: And in reality, when you have to give retro pay for three years for somebody who got a diploma in the middle of that and then increased in their step and then increased in their longevity, it is a painful manual process.

1140
02:02:22,077 --> 02:02:24,538
[SPEAKER_34]: And I believe Munis actually makes a lot of that stuff very easy.

1141
02:02:25,259 --> 02:02:35,486
[SPEAKER_34]: And adding these two people for $150,000 is, I'd rather take these people and get Munis, but I don't see us coming up with an additional $1.7 million anytime soon.

1142
02:02:37,751 --> 02:02:41,412
[SPEAKER_34]: I wanna get questions answered that we as a school committee really need.

1143
02:02:41,652 --> 02:02:57,436
[SPEAKER_34]: One of the reports that I've harped on now for six years, I think, is a hires and terminations report, which my understanding from when I go to the shore, all the other members of the board are from different districts in the area, no other Medford folks.

1144
02:02:57,576 --> 02:03:04,098
[SPEAKER_34]: So I get to hear how things operate everywhere, which is fascinating and wonderful and really upsetting at the same time.

1145
02:03:04,755 --> 02:03:06,557
[SPEAKER_34]: They all get a hires and terminations report.

1146
02:03:06,597 --> 02:03:08,198
[SPEAKER_34]: Some of them monthly, some of them quarterly.

1147
02:03:08,758 --> 02:03:10,160
[SPEAKER_34]: Shore gets it every single meeting.

1148
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:12,942
[SPEAKER_34]: And it says, who, what are the open positions?

1149
02:03:13,883 --> 02:03:18,267
[SPEAKER_34]: Who left the district and why?

1150
02:03:18,407 --> 02:03:23,831
[SPEAKER_34]: You know, not like gory details, but like designed, you know, medical or retired.

1151
02:03:25,152 --> 02:03:25,873
[SPEAKER_34]: Who do we hire?

1152
02:03:25,893 --> 02:03:30,357
[SPEAKER_34]: A really important report for school committees.

1153
02:03:32,236 --> 02:03:37,940
[SPEAKER_34]: For Medford to do that, it is not a report that you can do because our payroll system is separate from our HR system.

1154
02:03:38,301 --> 02:03:44,005
[SPEAKER_34]: Somebody would have to literally sit down and spend countless hours just to give us this report.

1155
02:03:44,125 --> 02:03:45,847
[SPEAKER_34]: And countless may not be the right number.

1156
02:03:46,027 --> 02:03:48,649
[SPEAKER_34]: If you go on our website, there's a staff directory.

1157
02:03:49,089 --> 02:03:51,111
[SPEAKER_34]: Do a search for somebody hired in the last few months.

1158
02:03:51,551 --> 02:03:52,031
[SPEAKER_34]: They're not there.

1159
02:03:52,612 --> 02:03:54,653
[SPEAKER_34]: Do a search for somebody who left last year.

1160
02:03:54,894 --> 02:03:55,514
[SPEAKER_34]: They're still there.

1161
02:03:55,934 --> 02:03:56,195
[SPEAKER_34]: Why?

1162
02:03:56,275 --> 02:03:59,337
[SPEAKER_34]: Because that and every other district is fed by the HR system.

1163
02:03:59,793 --> 02:04:01,314
[SPEAKER_34]: or the payroll, whatever, or Munis.

1164
02:04:02,415 --> 02:04:17,847
[SPEAKER_34]: In Medford, somebody has to have it on their to-do list in the HR or the payroll group to go in, run a report, probably make it look pretty, send it over to Lisa at, you know, and the web design team who will then like have some students work.

1165
02:04:17,867 --> 02:04:21,970
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, it's like weeks of work for something that should just be automatic.

1166
02:04:22,090 --> 02:04:27,474
[SPEAKER_34]: So I very much support these positions, even though I understand, you know,

1167
02:04:28,510 --> 02:04:35,496
[SPEAKER_34]: that there's a cost and there's an opportunity there that we're, there's a loss because we're including these.

1168
02:04:38,738 --> 02:04:42,501
[SPEAKER_34]: HR also does all of the certification, teacher certification stuff.

1169
02:04:42,962 --> 02:04:52,650
[SPEAKER_34]: We used to have a deputy superintendent that did that, which from a financial perspective is probably not the most fiscally responsible person to be doing that.

1170
02:04:53,050 --> 02:04:55,472
[SPEAKER_34]: But now we have HR doing all that and it's like,

1171
02:04:56,052 --> 02:05:00,375
[SPEAKER_34]: We're not talking about an HR department, like, you know, 12 people.

1172
02:05:01,116 --> 02:05:09,263
[SPEAKER_34]: I tried to look it up and my vague memory is that payroll alone in Malden Public Schools, which isn't that much bigger than us, was four staffers.

1173
02:05:10,844 --> 02:05:13,846
[SPEAKER_34]: And so to say we're lean is really an understatement.

1174
02:05:14,327 --> 02:05:24,655
[SPEAKER_34]: And when we can't get the job done and, you know, I'm not gonna put words in your mouth, Jerry, but let's be honest, when there's not enough staff to get the work done, it doesn't get done

1175
02:05:25,287 --> 02:05:29,529
[SPEAKER_34]: in a timely manner, which I'll save that comment for later.

1176
02:05:29,769 --> 02:05:32,450
[SPEAKER_34]: So I definitely support that addition.

1177
02:05:32,650 --> 02:05:39,352
[SPEAKER_34]: And I actually believe this is the third year in a row where we've been like, let's add them then because we hear the problems.

1178
02:05:41,333 --> 02:05:45,535
[SPEAKER_34]: Somerville's technology budget is $5.4 million.

1179
02:05:45,935 --> 02:05:49,496
[SPEAKER_34]: So we're talking about going from 30 to 100,000.

1180
02:05:49,536 --> 02:05:52,397
[SPEAKER_34]: So Somerville has 500 more kids than us.

1181
02:05:54,748 --> 02:06:12,146
[SPEAKER_34]: So it's really staggering, frankly, to think of a school district with, what is that, 10-fold, more than 10-fold, 45-fold what we have for a small fraction more.

1182
02:06:14,133 --> 02:06:16,474
[SPEAKER_34]: It's not really anything to discuss.

1183
02:06:16,754 --> 02:06:27,580
[SPEAKER_34]: We know we need to bring that number up, but we don't need to bring that number up $100,000 a year, because by the time we have a reasonable budget, Somerville's technology budget will be a billion dollars.

1184
02:06:27,640 --> 02:06:29,001
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, we'll never get there.

1185
02:06:30,302 --> 02:06:32,963
[SPEAKER_34]: So that's an investment I really think we have to make.

1186
02:06:36,564 --> 02:06:37,204
[SPEAKER_34]: put it on the list.

1187
02:06:37,244 --> 02:06:42,266
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, that's the problem when there's not enough money, it's put it on the list and then you sort the list.

1188
02:06:42,646 --> 02:06:46,827
[SPEAKER_34]: And then these are the things that will never make the list, never make the actual funding.

1189
02:06:47,167 --> 02:06:49,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1190
02:06:50,028 --> 02:07:00,410
[SPEAKER_12]: What I'd like to see is like us, the school department coming up with a strategic plan just for technology, how it's led.

1191
02:07:00,790 --> 02:07:02,391
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's two separate,

1192
02:07:04,824 --> 02:07:13,992
[SPEAKER_12]: things that we have to look at is instructional technology that goes hand in hand with the curriculum.

1193
02:07:14,072 --> 02:07:22,220
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's more kind of teacher based in terms of what their needs are, how they're rolling out instruction.

1194
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:28,645
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have some classes, I think it's social studies that use online textbooks.

1195
02:07:30,529 --> 02:07:37,563
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there's like the plumbing for the network itself and how the schools are connected and.

1196
02:07:38,732 --> 02:07:46,414
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, there's all kinds of opportunities if you had a robust network connecting all the schools.

1197
02:07:46,474 --> 02:08:00,017
[SPEAKER_12]: And then of course you have to have a plan B network in case something, you know, what are the odds of a truck knocking out, you know, utility pole and like taking down communication.

1198
02:08:00,097 --> 02:08:01,137
[SPEAKER_12]: So you have to have,

1199
02:08:02,074 --> 02:08:16,557
[SPEAKER_12]: redundancies built in, but there's ways to kind of manage your facilities if they were all connected to kind of keep our energy costs in check.

1200
02:08:19,257 --> 02:08:22,758
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's just a lot to take advantage of.

1201
02:08:23,878 --> 02:08:26,419
[SPEAKER_12]: And right now it's the way we handle our,

1202
02:08:28,925 --> 02:08:31,167
[SPEAKER_12]: building repairs, it's a break-fix model.

1203
02:08:31,868 --> 02:08:42,618
[SPEAKER_12]: You just let things go until they break, and then if you don't have to deal with it right away, don't deal with it, but if you have to deal with it right away, even if you have no money.

1204
02:08:44,299 --> 02:08:45,380
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, it's got to be done.

1205
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:52,605
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, trying to be more preventive, eliminate downtime to the best we can.

1206
02:08:53,706 --> 02:09:01,531
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have, you know, students are taking tests online, MCAS and PSATs, AP.

1207
02:09:02,192 --> 02:09:08,656
[SPEAKER_12]: So you have to have, be paying attention to the bandwidth that you have to get to these

1208
02:09:10,077 --> 02:09:11,978
[SPEAKER_12]: sites in order to take the test.

1209
02:09:12,858 --> 02:09:16,699
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not a luxury anymore.

1210
02:09:16,739 --> 02:09:17,739
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just integral.

1211
02:09:17,839 --> 02:09:21,020
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a mission critical part of running a school now.

1212
02:09:22,461 --> 02:09:22,801
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1213
02:09:23,001 --> 02:09:24,401
[SPEAKER_34]: I certainly agree.

1214
02:09:24,421 --> 02:09:25,182
[SPEAKER_34]: It's mission critical.

1215
02:09:26,482 --> 02:09:27,522
[SPEAKER_34]: This is my seventh year.

1216
02:09:27,542 --> 02:09:30,663
[SPEAKER_34]: I still can't use the internet when I go to Medford High.

1217
02:09:30,683 --> 02:09:35,665
[SPEAKER_34]: And I've sort of wore myself hoarse trying to actually get that to happen.

1218
02:09:38,868 --> 02:09:45,754
[SPEAKER_34]: you know, I have a computer science degree and I feel like anybody says that's not possible, like, I just can't.

1219
02:09:47,355 --> 02:09:49,377
[SPEAKER_34]: It's like, it's possible.

1220
02:09:49,557 --> 02:09:52,419
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, so is it possible for free?

1221
02:09:52,459 --> 02:09:53,420
[SPEAKER_34]: The answer is obviously no.

1222
02:09:54,021 --> 02:09:59,145
[SPEAKER_34]: So, you know, I did look at the number of nurses and changing gears a little here.

1223
02:09:59,785 --> 02:10:00,306
[SPEAKER_34]: Somerville has

1224
02:10:01,297 --> 02:10:03,037
[SPEAKER_34]: actually about 800 more students than us.

1225
02:10:03,258 --> 02:10:04,218
[SPEAKER_34]: This is a year ago.

1226
02:10:04,238 --> 02:10:07,499
[SPEAKER_34]: They do have 17 nurses, and we're going to be down to 11.

1227
02:10:07,919 --> 02:10:12,800
[SPEAKER_34]: I do think I am concerned about that.

1228
02:10:13,180 --> 02:10:22,423
[SPEAKER_34]: The guidance counselor ratios or whatever it was, the National Association of Guidance Counselors, we were better than that number.

1229
02:10:23,936 --> 02:10:26,277
[SPEAKER_34]: But I always wonder about how those numbers are created.

1230
02:10:26,437 --> 02:10:31,180
[SPEAKER_34]: Are they like serving the whole country, finding the average and saying, hey, that's the right number?

1231
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:41,165
[SPEAKER_34]: Because you have states where there's 10,000 kids per guidance counselor or something, like not maybe 10,000, so many thousands of kids for one guidance counselor.

1232
02:10:41,545 --> 02:10:42,946
[SPEAKER_34]: And same for nurses, frankly.

1233
02:10:44,166 --> 02:10:50,510
[SPEAKER_34]: So that's sort of like, that's interesting information, but is that the right,

1234
02:10:51,454 --> 02:11:04,566
[SPEAKER_34]: number is sort of I think the question I think other people have sort of said as well is like, what is the right number, you know, and you know when when I talked to like, just people in the community about the budget and how

1235
02:11:05,663 --> 02:11:13,550
[SPEAKER_34]: how it's the most insane system ever invented was public school budgeting, because we have to have our budget done before the state tells us even how much you're gonna get.

1236
02:11:13,590 --> 02:11:16,232
[SPEAKER_34]: Can you imagine setting your budget before knowing what you actually have for income?

1237
02:11:17,694 --> 02:11:20,856
[SPEAKER_34]: And the feds, they're always a year and a half late or whatever.

1238
02:11:22,218 --> 02:11:31,646
[SPEAKER_34]: But we also have the, I don't think there's any other scenario where students can just show up

1239
02:11:32,639 --> 02:11:35,080
[SPEAKER_34]: This is my big thing about calling charter schools public schools.

1240
02:11:35,300 --> 02:11:38,421
[SPEAKER_34]: If that's true, then anybody can just show up and enroll their kids, and that's not true.

1241
02:11:39,461 --> 02:11:44,982
[SPEAKER_34]: But tomorrow morning, 15 kids could show up, and we will educate them.

1242
02:11:45,583 --> 02:11:46,783
[SPEAKER_34]: Maybe not tomorrow morning, maybe the day after.

1243
02:11:46,803 --> 02:11:49,264
[SPEAKER_34]: And it doesn't matter what our budget was.

1244
02:11:49,784 --> 02:11:55,545
[SPEAKER_34]: And one of those students could require significant medical care.

1245
02:11:56,026 --> 02:11:58,206
[SPEAKER_34]: And it doesn't matter if that's $50,000 a month or even more.

1246
02:12:01,465 --> 02:12:06,171
[SPEAKER_34]: And I believe the number I heard was the highest was there was a student was running us $400,000 a year.

1247
02:12:06,632 --> 02:12:09,736
[SPEAKER_34]: Like, that's, I mean, we still should be doing it.

1248
02:12:09,836 --> 02:12:11,017
[SPEAKER_34]: That's what we have to do.

1249
02:12:11,278 --> 02:12:17,846
[SPEAKER_34]: However, when that student shows up in January and we set our budget in May of the previous year and we didn't have enough money then.

1250
02:12:19,142 --> 02:12:20,444
[SPEAKER_34]: we still have to figure it out.

1251
02:12:20,704 --> 02:12:26,831
[SPEAKER_34]: And so it's, I'm not, this has nothing to do with the students at all here.

1252
02:12:27,211 --> 02:12:31,736
[SPEAKER_34]: But my point is just that unlike any other endeavor where you can be like, well, we just won't do it this year.

1253
02:12:32,077 --> 02:12:35,360
[SPEAKER_34]: It's like, oh, there's a road and it has a pothole and you're like, everybody's complaining.

1254
02:12:35,380 --> 02:12:36,342
[SPEAKER_34]: You're like, we don't have any money.

1255
02:12:37,243 --> 02:12:39,325
[SPEAKER_34]: You wait for the next year and then you do it.

1256
02:12:40,595 --> 02:12:43,278
[SPEAKER_34]: And that's literally not an option for schools.

1257
02:12:43,818 --> 02:12:44,899
[SPEAKER_34]: We will always do it.

1258
02:12:45,379 --> 02:12:56,970
[SPEAKER_34]: And if those students that show up mean that we have to increase the number of classrooms here or there, and it makes it so that we don't have enough resource, then we will actually cut somewhere else, because negative isn't an option.

1259
02:12:56,990 --> 02:12:59,372
[SPEAKER_34]: Because as you pointed out, you don't want to be Brockton.

1260
02:12:59,412 --> 02:13:05,357
[SPEAKER_34]: And I don't know if everybody knows what's going on in Brockton, but they had a $22 million deficit in the current year.

1261
02:13:06,943 --> 02:13:13,881
[SPEAKER_34]: To be clear, that means that unless their city just rides in with a check, people are losing their jobs mid-teaching a class.

1262
02:13:14,656 --> 02:13:30,629
[SPEAKER_34]: Like, goodbye tomorrow you don't have a job and we'll figure out what to do with the students stick them in study halls, I mean I don't know what's really going on in their schools, but you don't cut $22 million in the middle of a school year without it being a bloodbath frankly that that's that's probably what it is.

1263
02:13:31,730 --> 02:13:37,295
[SPEAKER_34]: And so, I greatly appreciate that you have sort of set the bar there is that we will not be.

1264
02:13:38,359 --> 02:13:47,781
[SPEAKER_34]: this, like Brockton, and I don't know anything about their system and their school committee and their city and how they came to their budget and how they lost all that money.

1265
02:13:48,381 --> 02:13:52,182
[SPEAKER_34]: It's nothing to say negatively about them, but we can't be them.

1266
02:13:52,983 --> 02:14:02,265
[SPEAKER_34]: And there's lots of other districts that have gone through this much smaller scale, but I'm glad we won't be

1267
02:14:03,174 --> 02:14:03,974
[SPEAKER_34]: in that situation.

1268
02:14:04,095 --> 02:14:16,921
[SPEAKER_34]: So I just wanted to, there's one other thing I've heard a number of times, and I was just laid off in December after 26 years from my employment, which I hadn't really disclosed publicly, but, and it's not been easy.

1269
02:14:17,121 --> 02:14:18,062
[SPEAKER_34]: I've never been laid off.

1270
02:14:19,042 --> 02:14:27,367
[SPEAKER_34]: And frankly, I kind of thought I was in this job till I was retiring because big company and I liked the work and it was always work.

1271
02:14:28,107 --> 02:14:28,267
[SPEAKER_34]: And,

1272
02:14:30,984 --> 02:14:35,027
[SPEAKER_34]: there's this amusing thing that happens in layoffs in private companies.

1273
02:14:35,607 --> 02:14:38,969
[SPEAKER_34]: And I sort of hear it happening here is what are we gonna do with the work?

1274
02:14:38,989 --> 02:14:40,570
[SPEAKER_34]: What are we gonna do with the work?

1275
02:14:40,930 --> 02:14:43,792
[SPEAKER_34]: And it's fascinating.

1276
02:14:43,832 --> 02:14:52,618
[SPEAKER_34]: Like I had a great boss and I think a lot of people were like, well, we got to transfer the work from this person to that person who's already working completely maxed out.

1277
02:14:53,699 --> 02:14:56,961
[SPEAKER_34]: But we don't ever just come to terms with the fact that maybe the work won't get done.

1278
02:14:58,286 --> 02:15:03,270
[SPEAKER_34]: And obviously, students in your class, as a teacher, that's not really the scenario.

1279
02:15:03,670 --> 02:15:09,474
[SPEAKER_34]: But when I talk about, like, if we have to cut $2.7 million, I mean, I don't know where it's coming from.

1280
02:15:09,854 --> 02:15:14,737
[SPEAKER_34]: But if it doesn't come from classrooms, then maybe there's nobody cleaning the classrooms anymore.

1281
02:15:14,958 --> 02:15:17,059
[SPEAKER_34]: Like, that would be a worst case scenario.

1282
02:15:17,099 --> 02:15:21,202
[SPEAKER_34]: But like, the idea that the work will always just get done is ludicrous.

1283
02:15:22,574 --> 02:15:23,154
[SPEAKER_34]: It's ludicrous.

1284
02:15:23,355 --> 02:15:34,884
[SPEAKER_34]: It's just not, you know, I look at these administrators and secretaries and other people who are doing work and whether there's too many of them for the amount of work and all that stuff is an important consideration for the administration.

1285
02:15:34,904 --> 02:15:49,175
[SPEAKER_34]: And if, you know, this is public money, we have to be good stewards, but they were doing something and, you know, all those administrators, their work, will it actually get done or will we simply put it on their plate?

1286
02:15:49,235 --> 02:15:50,796
[SPEAKER_34]: And then that plate will just grow like,

1287
02:15:52,290 --> 02:15:54,452
[SPEAKER_34]: some of those folks already were doing more than one job.

1288
02:15:55,673 --> 02:16:00,017
[SPEAKER_34]: And in particular, I've been on the HECAT, the Health Education Curriculum.

1289
02:16:00,950 --> 02:16:07,394
[SPEAKER_34]: whatever the AT stands for, for the last year or two, I can't remember how long we've been doing that.

1290
02:16:07,734 --> 02:16:14,298
[SPEAKER_34]: And we finished the analysis and I feel like we're ready to start talking about picking one and implementing one.

1291
02:16:14,838 --> 02:16:19,841
[SPEAKER_34]: And the person running that is one of the people who is no longer gonna be at least in that role.

1292
02:16:19,861 --> 02:16:26,805
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, I understand with the way movement happens that they may still work here, but they won't be working here in that role.

1293
02:16:27,492 --> 02:16:29,793
[SPEAKER_34]: So that work certainly doesn't belong in that.

1294
02:16:30,173 --> 02:16:38,976
[SPEAKER_34]: If you're running the health curriculum and now you're running math, which makes no sense, you aren't gonna be doing the health curriculum too.

1295
02:16:39,716 --> 02:16:43,818
[SPEAKER_34]: And even if we did say, hey, you gotta keep doing that, they gotta do math.

1296
02:16:44,498 --> 02:16:52,641
[SPEAKER_34]: So we just spent all this time, we've heard from the community, the health curriculum here is not where we want it.

1297
02:16:53,541 --> 02:16:55,602
[SPEAKER_34]: And now I feel like, is it just,

1298
02:16:57,021 --> 02:17:07,867
[SPEAKER_34]: hope and a prayer until maybe someday we have enough money to actually implement a health curriculum that our students will have some clue what's going on before they're adults.

1299
02:17:08,747 --> 02:17:17,412
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm just deeply worried about that because we did just invest so much time and I just don't see how it happens without the staff.

1300
02:17:19,192 --> 02:17:24,195
[SPEAKER_34]: I seem like I'm talking and not asking a lot of questions, but I do think it's important just to

1301
02:17:25,702 --> 02:17:28,844
[SPEAKER_34]: And I know that we have regulatory requirements.

1302
02:17:29,985 --> 02:17:32,587
[SPEAKER_34]: So we do have to say, oh, the work is going over here.

1303
02:17:33,868 --> 02:17:45,255
[SPEAKER_34]: But we also have to just be a little more honest about it actually isn't gonna get done though, because there's just so much time in a day, and it's just not gonna get done.

1304
02:17:45,495 --> 02:17:49,678
[SPEAKER_34]: And I do wish we were more able, without getting the regulators on our back,

1305
02:17:50,543 --> 02:17:55,764
[SPEAKER_34]: to say, here's the pile of work, we put it over there, and let's identify all the work that will not get done.

1306
02:17:56,084 --> 02:18:01,726
[SPEAKER_34]: Because then that's kind of a story to tell the community when we say, we need more money with an override or something.

1307
02:18:02,086 --> 02:18:05,806
[SPEAKER_34]: And they're like, you have now half the administrators, and you're getting it all done.

1308
02:18:06,507 --> 02:18:07,387
[SPEAKER_34]: Why would you need more money?

1309
02:18:07,427 --> 02:18:09,087
[SPEAKER_34]: That's insane.

1310
02:18:09,667 --> 02:18:12,608
[SPEAKER_34]: If you can get it done with half the people, why would we give you twice as much money?

1311
02:18:13,328 --> 02:18:15,889
[SPEAKER_34]: And we just tell that story.

1312
02:18:17,699 --> 02:18:21,140
[SPEAKER_34]: Instead of saying, no, there will be nobody doing this work.

1313
02:18:21,780 --> 02:18:27,682
[SPEAKER_34]: And here it is on the pile of things that we might do if the city was to have an override and it was to pass.

1314
02:18:28,502 --> 02:18:29,403
[SPEAKER_34]: But we don't do that.

1315
02:18:29,803 --> 02:18:33,744
[SPEAKER_34]: And I think that's a missed opportunity to be honest and transparent.

1316
02:18:34,444 --> 02:18:36,185
[SPEAKER_34]: We talk about transparency sort of

1317
02:18:37,242 --> 02:18:48,351
[SPEAKER_34]: endlessly, everybody has their own definition of transparency that, by the way, this is the most transparent presentation I've ever seen, but transparency does mean different things to different people.

1318
02:18:48,391 --> 02:18:55,836
[SPEAKER_34]: And so I think of transparency, especially around this job consolidation, as we're not doing the work.

1319
02:18:56,056 --> 02:19:02,702
[SPEAKER_34]: Instead of saying, this administrator is picking up two other administrators' jobs, and they're gonna get it done.

1320
02:19:04,580 --> 02:19:06,361
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm just not able to buy that.

1321
02:19:06,601 --> 02:19:11,624
[SPEAKER_34]: And so this presentation to me represents a disaster.

1322
02:19:11,644 --> 02:19:20,608
[SPEAKER_34]: I think the $2.7 additional million in cuts represents a catastrophe, although I didn't use the dictionary to know the exact differences.

1323
02:19:22,222 --> 02:19:24,925
[SPEAKER_34]: if we have to make the additional 2.7 million in cuts.

1324
02:19:25,806 --> 02:19:29,710
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm saying it out loud because, again, for transparency purposes, there are limits.

1325
02:19:29,970 --> 02:19:32,132
[SPEAKER_34]: We can't have too many kids in a classroom.

1326
02:19:32,152 --> 02:19:34,675
[SPEAKER_34]: We have a teacher's contract, maximum size classroom.

1327
02:19:34,715 --> 02:19:40,921
[SPEAKER_34]: We're not gonna be in one of these districts with 40 kids sitting on heaters around the building.

1328
02:19:41,141 --> 02:19:44,925
[SPEAKER_34]: That's never gonna be met, at least with our current teacher's contract, and hopefully just never.

1329
02:19:45,913 --> 02:19:56,956
[SPEAKER_34]: So if we're not doing that, and we can't, you know, we have minimum manning for the custodial, which is reasonable, at some point we have to start looking at programs.

1330
02:19:57,996 --> 02:20:05,598
[SPEAKER_34]: And nobody wants to say it out loud, but if anybody thinks we're getting rid of math or science or English or history, y'all need your heads examined.

1331
02:20:05,618 --> 02:20:06,378
[SPEAKER_34]: That's not happening.

1332
02:20:06,718 --> 02:20:13,160
[SPEAKER_34]: What's happening is the arts, the sports, those are going, and those are not 2.7 million probably altogether.

1333
02:20:14,082 --> 02:20:20,063
[SPEAKER_34]: So we need more money, and I hope to never have to vote on another $2.7 million cut.

1334
02:20:27,605 --> 02:20:28,065
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham?

1335
02:20:29,305 --> 02:20:29,665
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1336
02:20:30,885 --> 02:20:32,346
[SPEAKER_17]: This is my fifth budget.

1337
02:20:33,326 --> 02:20:42,668
[SPEAKER_17]: They all feel like they've been bad, but in the first budget, actually, we went through an exercise where I think for the first time we said, if you could have

1338
02:20:44,793 --> 02:20:56,063
[SPEAKER_17]: What you needed to make to improve student outcomes, what would it be and the list quickly was eight to $10 million right off the bat without a lot of strategic thinking or planning.

1339
02:20:56,984 --> 02:21:00,007
[SPEAKER_17]: And I feel like we're still in that same exact position.

1340
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:08,065
[SPEAKER_17]: with one exception, which is that we've made deep investments in technology out of necessity because of COVID.

1341
02:21:08,346 --> 02:21:18,273
[SPEAKER_17]: But I have to tell you the idea that we could prepare students for the future without computers in their hands is absolutely ludicrous.

1342
02:21:18,313 --> 02:21:23,377
[SPEAKER_17]: Like we can't not buy equipment for our students.

1343
02:21:23,757 --> 02:21:26,319
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like not giving them a textbook in today's time.

1344
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:29,402
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have made curriculum decisions

1345
02:21:29,949 --> 02:21:41,520
[SPEAKER_17]: that are central to using computers in lieu of textbooks so that they can be modern, so that they're not outdated, so that they access all the latest and the greatest, which is what our students deserve.

1346
02:21:42,321 --> 02:21:48,187
[SPEAKER_17]: But we must be able to give them a computer to do that, because if we don't, they cannot learn.

1347
02:21:48,707 --> 02:21:54,533
[SPEAKER_17]: So I understand the idea that maybe we could wait on this, but we can't if it means students don't have equipment.

1348
02:21:55,330 --> 02:22:01,471
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, if there's another way to fund that replacement, that is great, and I'm all ears.

1349
02:22:02,452 --> 02:22:10,034
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe there's ARPA money left over in the city that could do that in a one-time way that would get us through that piece of this year.

1350
02:22:10,654 --> 02:22:17,935
[SPEAKER_17]: But we have to plan for that instructional technology to be available to our students, because otherwise, we are not preparing them for the future.

1351
02:22:18,015 --> 02:22:18,736
[SPEAKER_17]: We just aren't.

1352
02:22:20,751 --> 02:22:24,914
[SPEAKER_17]: I am imploring the city to find more than $73,500 for our kids, including my own.

1353
02:22:24,934 --> 02:22:26,915
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a high schooler and a middle schooler.

1354
02:22:27,315 --> 02:22:31,578
[SPEAKER_17]: These cuts are deep and we're still $2.7 million away.

1355
02:22:32,358 --> 02:22:40,804
[SPEAKER_17]: If we need to use one-time funds to plug the hole, let's do that and then put this question to the voters so that they can decide whether our schools are worth funding.

1356
02:22:41,224 --> 02:22:53,649
[SPEAKER_17]: If we make all of these cuts today, right now, there's nothing left for our residents to have faith in and to believe that we could be better than we are.

1357
02:22:55,069 --> 02:23:01,152
[SPEAKER_17]: So I really think we need a better plan that doesn't involve making $2.7 million more cuts.

1358
02:23:02,432 --> 02:23:07,254
[SPEAKER_17]: So if I am really thinking about what I think the city needs to be considering, and I know

1359
02:23:08,257 --> 02:23:12,464
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, a conversation that is much bigger than just this, the folks in this room.

1360
02:23:13,525 --> 02:23:17,592
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the $2.3 million additional the appropriation increase.

1361
02:23:17,892 --> 02:23:19,174
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the $470,000 on chapter 70 and at minimum.

1362
02:23:22,068 --> 02:23:25,469
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like $3.3 million on top of all of that.

1363
02:23:25,569 --> 02:23:27,769
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's a huge ask.

1364
02:23:27,989 --> 02:23:33,751
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't envy the city for thinking about that, but the city has to determine where the revenue comes from.

1365
02:23:33,771 --> 02:23:41,513
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate all the work that we've done to try to find proposals that we can survive with.

1366
02:23:42,093 --> 02:23:45,734
[SPEAKER_17]: Another 2.7 is not survivable at that point.

1367
02:23:47,369 --> 02:23:56,016
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to see all the hard work that we've done together, educators, administrators, support staff, school committee.

1368
02:23:56,076 --> 02:24:01,640
[SPEAKER_17]: We've made huge investments in this district, really strategically for as long as I've been here.

1369
02:24:01,740 --> 02:24:05,122
[SPEAKER_17]: We've bought new curriculum where the curricula didn't serve us.

1370
02:24:05,503 --> 02:24:09,926
[SPEAKER_17]: We have invested in mental health workers, which are needed by our students.

1371
02:24:10,506 --> 02:24:14,269
[SPEAKER_17]: We are trying to make all of these forward steps and we just,

1372
02:24:15,882 --> 02:24:17,356
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no more forward steps if we're.

1373
02:24:17,864 --> 02:24:22,027
[SPEAKER_17]: going to cut $4.5 million out of the budget, $5 million, whatever it is.

1374
02:24:22,848 --> 02:24:23,449
[SPEAKER_17]: It's too much.

1375
02:24:23,989 --> 02:24:25,490
[SPEAKER_17]: We never had that money to begin with.

1376
02:24:25,510 --> 02:24:27,932
[SPEAKER_17]: So we can complain about how many administrators we have.

1377
02:24:28,293 --> 02:24:30,434
[SPEAKER_17]: Spoiler, it's many fewer than most districts.

1378
02:24:30,855 --> 02:24:33,277
[SPEAKER_17]: We can complain about how much technology costs.

1379
02:24:33,317 --> 02:24:35,298
[SPEAKER_17]: Spoiler, it's much less than most districts.

1380
02:24:35,759 --> 02:24:37,260
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't spend money on maintenance.

1381
02:24:37,400 --> 02:24:38,721
[SPEAKER_17]: You all see it every day.

1382
02:24:40,382 --> 02:24:42,264
[SPEAKER_17]: We are underfunded.

1383
02:24:42,404 --> 02:24:43,365
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no two ways about it.

1384
02:24:43,525 --> 02:24:45,367
[SPEAKER_17]: Student Opportunity Act is not going to save us.

1385
02:24:46,844 --> 02:24:49,006
[SPEAKER_17]: It never was supposed to save a city like Medford.

1386
02:24:50,068 --> 02:24:58,197
[SPEAKER_17]: We need a different plan to fund our schools than we have been successful in finding in my four years here.

1387
02:24:58,258 --> 02:25:04,846
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't know exactly how we do that.

1388
02:25:06,468 --> 02:25:16,718
[SPEAKER_17]: I will be the first person knocking on your door when we do finally, for the first time in history, put an override to the voters to tell you about all the amazing things we can't do anymore because we don't have the money.

1389
02:25:16,738 --> 02:25:20,903
[SPEAKER_17]: I will ask you all to join me, but we have to do something different.

1390
02:25:21,403 --> 02:25:25,767
[SPEAKER_17]: And blowing up the schools at the beginning of FY25 is not the answer.

1391
02:25:26,088 --> 02:25:26,288
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1392
02:25:32,435 --> 02:25:39,098
[SPEAKER_20]: Just to piggyback on that from the chair, there's a group of us that have been meeting since the early fall, maybe September.

1393
02:25:39,599 --> 02:25:44,581
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Graham, myself, and two members of the city council, chair and vice chair.

1394
02:25:45,262 --> 02:25:58,449
[SPEAKER_20]: And in, I believe it was late March, we did put out a press release where we just let the voters know, let the residents know that we are exploring two debt exclusions, one for the fire headquarters and one, of course,

1395
02:26:00,390 --> 02:26:01,930
[SPEAKER_20]: flagship new high school.

1396
02:26:02,531 --> 02:26:27,175
[SPEAKER_20]: In that, we also mentioned that this fall, there'll be two elections, one in September, one in November, and we do plan on putting potentially two override questions before the voters, one to help fund our schools and one for a potential sidewalk street maintenance crew that could help and provide support to our DPW and focus mainly on

1397
02:26:28,810 --> 02:26:34,673
[SPEAKER_20]: the lack of maintenance that we've been able to put in based on Chapter 90 funding to our streets.

1398
02:26:35,333 --> 02:26:36,934
[SPEAKER_20]: So that it has been discussed.

1399
02:26:37,034 --> 02:26:46,198
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not been discussed as a full committee, obviously, because we have open meeting law rules that we have to follow, but it is something that we are putting forward.

1400
02:26:46,378 --> 02:26:48,719
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if that will be September or November.

1401
02:26:48,799 --> 02:26:53,861
[SPEAKER_20]: Our next task force meeting is Friday, I believe, but obviously that is

1402
02:26:54,571 --> 02:27:03,975
[SPEAKER_20]: The position we are in, we used one-time funding for the budget for the last four years because of the pandemic, because of the lost revenues.

1403
02:27:04,696 --> 02:27:22,484
[SPEAKER_20]: We have been able to dwindle that down, of course, because those large buckets, we're in this position because all expenses are up, as well as all of our salaries and expenses cannot be met by the 2.5% that we're able to tax the voters.

1404
02:27:23,084 --> 02:27:23,885
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just too much.

1405
02:27:24,758 --> 02:27:37,108
[SPEAKER_20]: compiling that with these one-time funds that we've used, whether it be on the school side, I think about 1.5 million to 2 million, and then on the city side, luckily, we've been able to find a few grants.

1406
02:27:37,148 --> 02:27:46,536
[SPEAKER_20]: The Barr Foundation's one that's gonna be able to absorb some of the positions we have, but we're also doing some hard work.

1407
02:27:46,756 --> 02:27:52,041
[SPEAKER_20]: I think tonight is where I really realized where the gap was, because obviously you haven't called each of us

1408
02:27:52,757 --> 02:27:58,699
[SPEAKER_20]: explained fully other than when we've been in executive session or meetings or school committee meetings.

1409
02:27:58,779 --> 02:28:10,083
[SPEAKER_20]: So my next several days will be trying to talk to my finance director and working through the city side budget to make the necessary cuts to be able to provide more to the schools.

1410
02:28:10,323 --> 02:28:20,607
[SPEAKER_20]: At first I thought that was about a half million and come this weekend and tonight I'm realizing it's much more and that's including with some significant cuts that we all feel

1411
02:28:22,415 --> 02:28:23,195
[SPEAKER_20]: pretty upset about.

1412
02:28:23,295 --> 02:28:28,997
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I don't think there's a person behind this rail that either doesn't have a headache or a stomachache because this is real lives.

1413
02:28:29,037 --> 02:28:29,937
[SPEAKER_20]: This is our students.

1414
02:28:29,997 --> 02:28:36,238
[SPEAKER_20]: This is, this is real and it's, it's not a fun position to be in whatsoever.

1415
02:28:36,418 --> 02:28:49,222
[SPEAKER_20]: And as I talked to mayors across the state and I've talked to many, it seems like everybody is in this position because of these large buckets of one-time funding and people are doing overrides or having major cuts.

1416
02:28:49,822 --> 02:28:50,702
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we're trying to,

1417
02:28:51,986 --> 02:28:57,488
[SPEAKER_20]: We're trying to figure it out before we put a question for the residents, and I do think that will pass.

1418
02:28:57,628 --> 02:29:14,293
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's a balancing act, because we need to make sure we get a debt exclusion for potentially several hundred million dollars approved for a new high school, but it's the hard work that we have to do, and it's a tough week that I have ahead on the city side to try to figure this out.

1419
02:29:14,913 --> 02:29:16,434
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's where I am.

1420
02:29:20,086 --> 02:29:26,249
[SPEAKER_20]: Obviously, the first time this presentation was before us, so there's a lot of things that I didn't even know until tonight, and I appreciate the presentation.

1421
02:29:26,729 --> 02:29:28,550
[SPEAKER_20]: I know there's a number of people that would like to speak.

1422
02:29:29,370 --> 02:29:31,211
[SPEAKER_20]: We have a number of people online.

1423
02:29:31,271 --> 02:29:32,651
[SPEAKER_20]: We have a number of people here.

1424
02:29:34,192 --> 02:29:35,393
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a lot more work we have to do.

1425
02:29:35,413 --> 02:29:36,333
[SPEAKER_20]: This is very early.

1426
02:29:36,913 --> 02:29:40,875
[SPEAKER_20]: We gave the schools the numbers before the local receipts were in, before we had estimates.

1427
02:29:41,735 --> 02:29:43,276
[SPEAKER_20]: Hopefully, we can budge there.

1428
02:29:44,076 --> 02:29:47,818
[SPEAKER_20]: City councils do a budget May 31st if they get all their budget meetings in.

1429
02:29:48,413 --> 02:29:50,395
[SPEAKER_20]: So so there is it's early in the process.

1430
02:29:50,475 --> 02:29:51,977
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not a fun place to be in.

1431
02:29:52,017 --> 02:29:53,238
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we all have said that.

1432
02:29:54,419 --> 02:29:59,365
[SPEAKER_20]: So just hoping we can get to public comment after the school committee rests.

1433
02:30:00,985 --> 02:30:23,714
[SPEAKER_28]: hear from I just so I'm encouraged by the long-term prospects I want us to not be in this situation next year or any year after and then as we open this up to public comment I this you know this is what not just underfunded but deprioritized education looks like to be in this situation and so this year is terrible we are in a position where

1434
02:30:24,574 --> 02:30:26,655
[SPEAKER_28]: We're not going to find good solutions.

1435
02:30:26,995 --> 02:30:29,035
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to find the least bad solutions.

1436
02:30:29,435 --> 02:30:36,497
[SPEAKER_28]: So please work with us to help us figure out what we can do to not cause irreparable damage.

1437
02:30:38,958 --> 02:30:39,238
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1438
02:30:39,338 --> 02:30:40,179
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. McHugh.

1439
02:30:41,859 --> 02:30:46,520
[SPEAKER_20]: We have a lot of people on, so I think our rules say three minutes, one time each.

1440
02:30:46,720 --> 02:30:49,261
[SPEAKER_20]: Please make a line, and we want to hear from you.

1441
02:30:54,441 --> 02:31:01,284
[SPEAKER_34]: No, it is three minutes, but if people could just give their name and address where I can try to keep up rather than watching the whole of the meeting again.

1442
02:31:01,304 --> 02:31:02,324
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1443
02:31:02,724 --> 02:31:02,884
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1444
02:31:03,244 --> 02:31:05,325
[SPEAKER_27]: Name and address for the record, please.

1445
02:31:05,405 --> 02:31:05,705
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1446
02:31:06,286 --> 02:31:07,606
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, my name is Jennifer Silva.

1447
02:31:07,706 --> 02:31:09,207
[SPEAKER_27]: I gave my address via email.

1448
02:31:09,247 --> 02:31:11,047
[SPEAKER_27]: I will give my address as 49 Winthrop Street.

1449
02:31:12,388 --> 02:31:15,349
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Brianna Martinetti, 188 Washington Street, Medford.

1450
02:31:16,257 --> 02:31:17,238
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm a Medford School nurse.

1451
02:31:17,258 --> 02:31:20,961
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm the chairperson for the Medford chapter of the Massachusetts Nurses Association.

1452
02:31:21,021 --> 02:31:24,103
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm also a resident, and three of my children attend Medford Public Schools.

1453
02:31:24,844 --> 02:31:29,308
[SPEAKER_14]: And I am also a Medford School nurse, a Medford resident, and a Medford Public Schools alumnus.

1454
02:31:29,968 --> 02:31:33,131
[SPEAKER_27]: So the first thing we want to say is happy National Nurses Week to all the nurses in the room.

1455
02:31:33,151 --> 02:31:35,152
[SPEAKER_27]: I want you to listen to mine.

1456
02:31:41,337 --> 02:31:43,099
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you so much for everything you do every day.

1457
02:31:45,188 --> 02:31:49,430
[SPEAKER_27]: I really wanted to jump in and talk a lot about what we do, but I think I just want to jump into the meat of it right now.

1458
02:31:50,451 --> 02:31:53,332
[SPEAKER_27]: So really a proposed budget cut of four nursing positions.

1459
02:31:54,392 --> 02:31:56,754
[SPEAKER_27]: That's 25% of our current nursing workforce.

1460
02:31:57,414 --> 02:32:03,037
[SPEAKER_27]: So we are being disproportionately taken cuts on versus anything else that's happening in the district right now.

1461
02:32:04,177 --> 02:32:06,498
[SPEAKER_27]: That leaves us with 11.6 nursing positions.

1462
02:32:06,859 --> 02:32:10,981
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a level of staffing that we haven't seen since the 2016-2017 school year.

1463
02:32:12,141 --> 02:32:19,425
[SPEAKER_27]: Nursing staffing increased prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and our health care needs, our physical, emotional, social needs have only increased post-pandemic.

1464
02:32:22,030 --> 02:32:27,993
[SPEAKER_27]: Really with these cuts, we won't be able to provide the level of care that many of our students, caregivers and school staff have gone accustomed to and deserve.

1465
02:32:28,893 --> 02:32:30,714
[SPEAKER_27]: Our offices are gonna act like triage stations.

1466
02:32:30,734 --> 02:32:37,738
[SPEAKER_27]: We're gonna have to quickly, quickly move through students and move on to different sources of putting them in other places if we can't see them in our offices.

1467
02:32:39,599 --> 02:32:41,940
[SPEAKER_27]: The Director of Health Services has been vacant since February.

1468
02:32:41,960 --> 02:32:46,523
[SPEAKER_27]: The decision to drastically reduce the nursing staff is being made without consulting a director.

1469
02:32:47,646 --> 02:32:50,308
[SPEAKER_27]: The director would really have the knowledge of what's happening in our offices.

1470
02:32:50,708 --> 02:32:53,890
[SPEAKER_27]: I know there was a question about minimum nursing staffing.

1471
02:32:53,930 --> 02:32:56,632
[SPEAKER_27]: So DPH actually doesn't have any minimum staffing guidelines.

1472
02:32:57,453 --> 02:33:08,860
[SPEAKER_27]: And what the National Association of School Nurses says, which is our professional organization, is that appropriate staffing is necessary in order to provide safe care and is accomplished through understanding and considering the complexities of the role of the nurse and the care that is provided.

1473
02:33:09,260 --> 02:33:12,543
[SPEAKER_27]: Using a ratio of nurse to student alone is not evidence-based or appropriate.

1474
02:33:13,263 --> 02:33:22,427
[SPEAKER_27]: So determining nursing staffing without input of those who understand student acuity is inherently unsafe, especially for our most vulnerable students, and we can't go just this nurse to this many students.

1475
02:33:23,888 --> 02:33:26,429
[SPEAKER_27]: So just for some numbers, because I know we all love data, right?

1476
02:33:26,749 --> 02:33:32,592
[SPEAKER_27]: So this year, as of the beginning of this month, we have had 45,000 student visits to our health offices.

1477
02:33:33,472 --> 02:33:36,114
[SPEAKER_27]: We've also seen 350 staff in our offices.

1478
02:33:37,714 --> 02:33:40,255
[SPEAKER_27]: We manage specialized healthcare for approximately 1,800 students.

1479
02:33:42,605 --> 02:33:44,371
[SPEAKER_27]: We've administered 6,957 medications so far this school year.

1480
02:33:47,998 --> 02:33:57,681
[SPEAKER_27]: We've contacted parents via telephone, email, or talking points, which is a godsend, to 10,194 separate occasions we've had to contact parents about different healthcare needs.

1481
02:33:58,821 --> 02:34:02,962
[SPEAKER_27]: We've spoken with 216 physicians or other healthcare providers to coordinate care for our students.

1482
02:34:03,682 --> 02:34:07,383
[SPEAKER_27]: We've been to 181 meetings, whether that's 504, IEP meetings.

1483
02:34:08,243 --> 02:34:10,024
[SPEAKER_27]: And we've also had 911 calls.

1484
02:34:10,064 --> 02:34:13,525
[SPEAKER_27]: We've had 14 medical emergencies, bonafide medical emergencies, the nurses have called 911 for.

1485
02:34:14,778 --> 02:34:20,262
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that, making cuts to the nursing department will have a profound impact on students.

1486
02:34:21,162 --> 02:34:25,385
[SPEAKER_14]: It will lead to decreased time on learning with fewer nursing staff.

1487
02:34:25,765 --> 02:34:29,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, the average time out of class for our students is 7.4 minutes.

1488
02:34:29,568 --> 02:34:37,833
[SPEAKER_14]: And with fewer nurses in the office, that will inadvertently keep students out of the classroom longer since we're tending to one student and have five other students waiting if we're alone.

1489
02:34:39,594 --> 02:34:42,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Early dismissals may increase if we don't have the time to do a full assessment.

1490
02:34:42,877 --> 02:34:47,500
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have the time, if we have multiple students in the office, for students to rest appropriately.

1491
02:34:47,540 --> 02:34:50,342
[SPEAKER_14]: There's just not enough space if that many people are waiting.

1492
02:34:52,123 --> 02:35:02,391
[SPEAKER_14]: It could decrease the potential time for emergency response for students or staff if there's a medical emergency in the building and we're busy tied up caring for one thing going on already.

1493
02:35:04,292 --> 02:35:05,053
[SPEAKER_14]: Case management.

1494
02:35:06,004 --> 02:35:08,586
[SPEAKER_14]: the ability to provide case management will drastically diminish.

1495
02:35:09,968 --> 02:35:22,479
[SPEAKER_14]: We attend IEP meetings, 504 meetings, SST meetings, and if there's only one nurse in the building, we would have to then close our offices and it would be difficult to then provide those recommendations in those meetings.

1496
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:30,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Medical clearance for school registration and enrollment will take longer, leaving students out of the educational environment for unnecessary amounts of time.

1497
02:35:31,987 --> 02:35:32,448
[SPEAKER_14]: And the

1498
02:35:32,970 --> 02:35:43,562
[SPEAKER_14]: potential for medication errors is greater with fewer nurses in the office as it's easily distractible when there are multiple people entering the office and you're the only person in there.

1499
02:35:44,724 --> 02:35:53,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Mandated screenings will take longer, specifically leaving our most vulnerable students at risk who don't have health insurance or have lack of reliable health care.

1500
02:35:54,426 --> 02:36:00,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Children who do not know to report that their vision is impaired, especially if they've never seen clearly, are left at risk.

1501
02:36:01,608 --> 02:36:10,731
[SPEAKER_14]: And we won't have enough bandwidth to follow up with parents on referrals that have been sent out, making sure that we get them back and making sure that students have been seen.

1502
02:36:12,452 --> 02:36:16,716
[SPEAKER_14]: and also having less nursing staff will impact field trips.

1503
02:36:17,096 --> 02:36:26,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, we currently have 14 scheduled field trips that need a nurse to attend for various healthcare needs, whether it be medication, procedures, transportation aid.

1504
02:36:27,886 --> 02:36:31,750
[SPEAKER_14]: There are medications that we cannot administer to school staff.

1505
02:36:31,790 --> 02:36:36,774
[SPEAKER_14]: It needs to be provided by a nurse, so a nurse would have to attend.

1506
02:36:36,794 --> 02:36:38,215
[SPEAKER_14]: And if there's only one nurse in the building,

1507
02:36:39,814 --> 02:36:42,836
[SPEAKER_14]: either a substitute will need to be hired or those field trips will have to be canceled.

1508
02:36:44,897 --> 02:36:51,180
[SPEAKER_27]: So significant reduction in qualified school nursing staff could affect our ability to obtain the Massachusetts Controlled Substances Registration.

1509
02:36:51,260 --> 02:36:55,162
[SPEAKER_27]: That is how we are able to delegate medications and EpiPens to school staff.

1510
02:36:55,582 --> 02:36:59,184
[SPEAKER_27]: Without that, nurses would be responsible for administering every single medication.

1511
02:36:59,204 --> 02:37:00,865
[SPEAKER_27]: So John talked about carrying his EpiPen.

1512
02:37:01,325 --> 02:37:02,706
[SPEAKER_27]: That would no longer be possible.

1513
02:37:02,806 --> 02:37:06,287
[SPEAKER_27]: Nurses would have to administer every single med in the school setting and go to every single field trip.

1514
02:37:10,307 --> 02:37:20,090
[SPEAKER_27]: Finding substitute nurses is very difficult in school nursing so substitute nurses must be registered nurses, the substitute pay and method is significantly lower than our surrounding districts.

1515
02:37:21,670 --> 02:37:26,592
[SPEAKER_27]: And there's a lot of other per diem opportunities for nurses so school nursing isn't the first place that people are jumping to.

1516
02:37:27,332 --> 02:37:37,421
[SPEAKER_27]: Some of our surrounding districts, I know Somerville's already been mentioned in their staffing, they have also float nurses and resource nurses to help cover when either a nurse is out or for field trips and things like that.

1517
02:37:37,441 --> 02:37:38,802
[SPEAKER_27]: So they've already sort of built that in.

1518
02:37:38,862 --> 02:37:41,324
[SPEAKER_27]: With 11.6 nurses, we no longer have that built in.

1519
02:37:42,886 --> 02:37:52,354
[SPEAKER_27]: So we would be looking at hiring most likely agency nurses who can run upwards of $90 an hour to hire those agency nurses for those needs.

1520
02:37:53,973 --> 02:37:56,594
[SPEAKER_27]: Less nursing staff will also put an increased strain on the guidance department.

1521
02:37:56,994 --> 02:38:02,557
[SPEAKER_27]: Many students present to our nursing offices with psychosomatic symptoms that they may not recognize or anxiety or mental health concerns.

1522
02:38:03,897 --> 02:38:08,980
[SPEAKER_27]: Sometimes the school nurses are the first ones to sort of identify those for students and support them and make those mental health referrals.

1523
02:38:09,700 --> 02:38:14,082
[SPEAKER_27]: There was just a recent report where Dr. Shannon Toulouse, she's the Northeast Regional Nurse Consultant for DPH,

1524
02:38:15,142 --> 02:38:20,743
[SPEAKER_27]: said it's so much easier for a student to raise their hand and ask to see the nurse than to make a request to seek mental health counseling.

1525
02:38:21,503 --> 02:38:23,324
[SPEAKER_27]: So the nurses are the first places those kids end up.

1526
02:38:24,104 --> 02:38:30,645
[SPEAKER_27]: And then we can work with them, we can support them, whether they already have plans in place to sort of get them back to class without having to see a guidance counselor.

1527
02:38:31,365 --> 02:38:37,866
[SPEAKER_27]: And without being able to do that, without having significantly less nurses in our office, we may be immediately trying to send them to counselors who are not available.

1528
02:38:38,206 --> 02:38:42,687
[SPEAKER_27]: And then that increases the time out of class that they're waiting to see those guidance counselors or those adjustment counselors.

1529
02:38:44,437 --> 02:38:48,019
[SPEAKER_27]: So, you know, we were asked to come to school and nobody else did, we did, we said, okay.

1530
02:38:48,039 --> 02:38:51,101
[SPEAKER_27]: We were asked to test all students and staff for COVID-19, we said, okay.

1531
02:38:51,862 --> 02:38:54,923
[SPEAKER_27]: We were asked to complete contact tracing during the pandemic, we said, okay.

1532
02:39:01,387 --> 02:39:03,929
[SPEAKER_27]: We were asked to track immunization compliance for staff and we said, okay.

1533
02:39:04,069 --> 02:39:10,813
[SPEAKER_27]: So now we really ask that you support our students by maintaining safe nursing staffing levels to allow school nurses to appropriately care for all students.

1534
02:39:12,374 --> 02:39:12,734
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1535
02:39:13,074 --> 02:39:13,314
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1536
02:39:23,624 --> 02:39:25,905
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Rousseau, then Member Brantley, and then you'll be next, sorry.

1537
02:39:26,705 --> 02:39:37,109
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't know if everybody in line is all the people that wanna talk, but I do, the three minutes is not meant to cut anybody off, but nobody wants to be speaking at midnight, so if we can try.

1538
02:39:37,129 --> 02:39:46,433
[SPEAKER_34]: I wish we had a timer like you see in the State House, and I really, just not to scream at you when your time's up, but so you know, because I'm the talker, I go on and on.

1539
02:39:47,053 --> 02:39:49,754
[SPEAKER_20]: I gave them six minutes, Member Rousseau, there was two of them.

1540
02:39:50,722 --> 02:39:51,363
[SPEAKER_34]: No, that's fine.

1541
02:39:51,503 --> 02:39:53,705
[SPEAKER_34]: I just, you know, it's hard three minutes.

1542
02:39:56,287 --> 02:39:58,708
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Brantley and then we'll yield to the residents.

1543
02:39:59,689 --> 02:40:01,270
[SPEAKER_29]: Nurse Jen, can I just ask you a question?

1544
02:40:02,211 --> 02:40:03,832
[SPEAKER_29]: How many nurses do we have in the district right now?

1545
02:40:03,852 --> 02:40:07,335
[SPEAKER_29]: I might have that number here, but the numbers are- That's okay.

1546
02:40:07,355 --> 02:40:12,879
[SPEAKER_27]: So we currently have 16 positions, but that's, so it's a 15.6 full-time equivalents because we have one part-time nurse.

1547
02:40:14,020 --> 02:40:14,200
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

1548
02:40:15,822 --> 02:40:17,324
[SPEAKER_29]: And what number day are we on in school?

1549
02:40:17,364 --> 02:40:22,649
[SPEAKER_29]: I know, I know everybody here definitely knows that 29 days left.

1550
02:40:22,769 --> 02:40:23,029
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

1551
02:40:23,049 --> 02:40:24,550
[SPEAKER_29]: Nobody's counting.

1552
02:40:24,570 --> 02:40:26,612
[SPEAKER_29]: I get it.

1553
02:40:26,632 --> 02:40:27,513
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

1554
02:40:27,713 --> 02:40:28,094
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1555
02:40:28,134 --> 02:40:28,634
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1556
02:40:30,616 --> 02:40:31,617
[SPEAKER_20]: Just name and address for the record.

1557
02:40:31,637 --> 02:40:31,857
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1558
02:40:32,885 --> 02:40:34,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, my name is Olivia Pereira.

1559
02:40:34,926 --> 02:40:37,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not a Medford resident, but I am a Medford public school nurse.

1560
02:40:39,068 --> 02:40:45,832
[SPEAKER_05]: I am actually the float nurse for the district, and I am the position that is being proposed being cut.

1561
02:40:47,355 --> 02:40:51,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to stand before you guys today just to make my face known and my role known.

1562
02:40:53,559 --> 02:40:58,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I have grown as a nurse, and I have found my passion as a school nurse within the Medford Public School community.

1563
02:40:59,703 --> 02:41:05,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to believe that I've proven myself a valuable asset to this community and to the Health Services Department.

1564
02:41:06,107 --> 02:41:15,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I am the only staff member that speaks three languages, and I have built an interpersonal connection with families, staff, and students that no Google Translate nor Pocket Talk can

1565
02:41:17,757 --> 02:41:18,177
[SPEAKER_05]: account for.

1566
02:41:18,197 --> 02:41:29,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I have provided coverage during maternity leaves, in the absence of a full-time nursing position for nearly five months, and on spur of the moment sick calls.

1567
02:41:29,820 --> 02:41:36,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I also receive phone calls on a regular basis from other nursing buildings to assist to translate insensitive matters.

1568
02:41:36,782 --> 02:41:44,624
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been pulled by teaching staff on multiple occasions to help translate for families for IEP meetings, 504 meetings, when our district translator is unavailable.

1569
02:41:46,280 --> 02:41:52,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to stand before you today, despite feeling as though I'm cast aside, to advocate for my colleagues.

1570
02:41:52,944 --> 02:42:08,954
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to share my distaste for what is happening to them and to the Health Services Department, as they have all worked tirelessly to ensure a safe and welcoming environment, having seen over 45,000 students to date, and maintaining health status to ensure students can resume learning.

1571
02:42:10,157 --> 02:42:30,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Eliminating additional positions not only places our staff with a shortage, but it increases student wait times for the nursing office, places stress on teaching staff to triage within their classrooms, and it will severely limit and delay the availability and opportunities of students to have extracurricular activities that are pre-screened by our health department.

1572
02:42:31,207 --> 02:42:36,770
[SPEAKER_05]: This may include field trips, registration for school, and sports registrations.

1573
02:42:37,590 --> 02:42:39,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I caution whomever has

1574
02:42:40,017 --> 02:42:51,802
[SPEAKER_05]: received my email or heard me speak today to consider the increasing social emotional needs of our students who are unable to distinguish between physical and psychological needs.

1575
02:42:52,982 --> 02:42:56,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Our school district and community will not continue to thrive with a nursing shortage.

1576
02:42:58,004 --> 02:43:00,805
[SPEAKER_05]: And the increase in burnout is a very real possibility.

1577
02:43:01,765 --> 02:43:05,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I urge you to recognize our hard work and the dedication of my colleagues

1578
02:43:06,417 --> 02:43:12,401
[SPEAKER_05]: and to take these above mentioned factors into consideration when making the budget for the upcoming year.

1579
02:43:12,621 --> 02:43:12,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1580
02:43:24,809 --> 02:43:32,174
[SPEAKER_20]: You're next, but before you go, if anybody in the audience is having conversations, could you please just take it outside and then come back in?

1581
02:43:32,314 --> 02:43:34,556
[SPEAKER_20]: Cause I just want to make sure we can all focus on the speaker.

1582
02:43:34,896 --> 02:43:35,136
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1583
02:43:39,960 --> 02:43:41,241
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, my name is Kelly Williams.

1584
02:43:41,621 --> 02:43:43,902
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a registered nurse in the Medford public school system.

1585
02:43:44,522 --> 02:43:52,225
[SPEAKER_16]: My previous practice setting as an ER nurse was in one of the busiest emergency departments in the Commonwealth, and I'm now a nationally board certified school nurse.

1586
02:43:52,966 --> 02:44:02,570
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very familiar with the devastating effects of a delay in pre-hospital care that will result from your decision to cut 25% of the Medford Public Schools Health Services staff.

1587
02:44:04,102 --> 02:44:09,765
[SPEAKER_16]: Equity and access to health care in the school setting is a vital component of supporting students throughout their educational journey.

1588
02:44:10,885 --> 02:44:26,933
[SPEAKER_16]: The inequitable and insufficient access to health services that will result from your decision to cut 25% of nursing staff is unsafe and unethical, particularly in the setting of a school committee receiving a 145% increase in salary within the same fiscal year.

1589
02:44:28,692 --> 02:44:34,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Access to health services in Medford Public Schools will be insufficient, inequitable, and unsafe because of the proposed cut.

1590
02:44:35,515 --> 02:44:43,839
[SPEAKER_16]: Health services, an all-female department, is being disproportionately impacted by this proposal, raising the degree of suspicion for gender discrimination.

1591
02:44:47,401 --> 02:44:53,484
[SPEAKER_16]: Research shows that school nurses increase health equity and increase access to care for traditionally disadvantaged populations.

1592
02:44:54,656 --> 02:45:12,109
[SPEAKER_16]: The suggested allocation of less nurses across the district is inconsistent with equitable access to care for all and will result in damages in the form of increased wait times, increased time out of the class, delays in care that may result in poor outcomes, and exacerbation of conditions to exceed management in the school setting.

1593
02:45:13,871 --> 02:45:19,676
[SPEAKER_16]: resulting in preventable dismissal and transfer to higher level of care.

1594
02:45:20,737 --> 02:45:25,022
[SPEAKER_16]: I implore you to consider the negative impact on student outcomes within this vulnerable population.

1595
02:45:26,663 --> 02:45:32,149
[SPEAKER_16]: Research states that school nurses can only address disparities in access to care if they're located where there is need.

1596
02:45:34,451 --> 02:45:48,469
[SPEAKER_16]: Research also shows that students requiring special consideration for chronic health care needs are at higher risk of lower academic achievement, increased rate of disability related to chronic health challenges, and less opportunities for job offers and community engagement.

1597
02:45:50,145 --> 02:46:05,196
[SPEAKER_16]: Health assessments, individualized health care plans, evidence-informed intervention, coordination with students, families, and community resources are examples of school health services that directly impact a student's ability to remain in school while managing chronic health challenges.

1598
02:46:06,897 --> 02:46:15,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Research has proven that direct access to school nursing services improved clinical outcomes and reduced absences among children with chronic health challenges.

1599
02:46:16,900 --> 02:46:24,962
[SPEAKER_16]: Outcomes have revealed that absences impact standardized testing, rates of graduation, future earning potential, and long-term quality of life.

1600
02:46:26,942 --> 02:46:39,925
[SPEAKER_16]: To create an environment with truly equitable access to sufficient support services to meet their needs, Medford Public Schools must prioritize the health needs of the student population, as challenges in health are directly related to academic outcomes.

1601
02:46:43,533 --> 02:46:54,191
[SPEAKER_16]: Registered nurses in schools demonstrate a significant return on our investment in education, in the future of chronic disease management, and in our nation's potential to grow flourishing communities and engaged citizens.

1602
02:46:55,643 --> 02:46:59,466
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a much increase in students' ability to return to class when there's a school nurse present.

1603
02:47:00,166 --> 02:47:15,737
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a low threshold for dismissal when there's not a school nurse present and or available to conduct an assessment, create a plan, implement interventions as necessary, evaluate the efficacy of the interventions, modify as needed and determine if the student is safe to remain in school.

1604
02:47:17,479 --> 02:47:23,423
[SPEAKER_16]: Reduction in health services will result in more triaging in the classroom as access to health services will be severely limited.

1605
02:47:24,872 --> 02:47:31,353
[SPEAKER_16]: The liability for a staff member who is not a health care professional to respond to requests for health services is immense and for good reason.

1606
02:47:32,534 --> 02:47:40,856
[SPEAKER_16]: The intricate nature of school nursing in Massachusetts requires double licensure, registered nurse license and department of secondary education educator's license.

1607
02:47:41,576 --> 02:47:50,238
[SPEAKER_16]: For this reason, the sensitive nature of administering school health services should never be delegated to non-professional personnel without school nurse to supervise.

1608
02:47:51,294 --> 02:47:56,097
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the unintended consequence of your decision to drastically reduce health services staff in Medford.

1609
02:47:57,838 --> 02:47:58,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1610
02:48:08,425 --> 02:48:09,605
[SPEAKER_20]: Names and address for the record.

1611
02:48:09,785 --> 02:48:11,827
[SPEAKER_03]: James Casey, 835 Felder West.

1612
02:48:12,887 --> 02:48:14,949
[SPEAKER_18]: Lindsey Quinn, 16 Hatch Road.

1613
02:48:16,389 --> 02:48:17,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Benjamin Sayers, 19 Park Street.

1614
02:48:18,771 --> 02:48:20,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Lena Harrison, 30 Lincoln Street.

1615
02:48:21,874 --> 02:48:23,575
[SPEAKER_18]: Riley Mulvihill, 92 Hume Avenue.

1616
02:48:25,917 --> 02:48:31,302
[SPEAKER_18]: So the five of us standing here today have been going to see the Drama Club put on production since elementary school.

1617
02:48:31,802 --> 02:48:38,588
[SPEAKER_18]: And now that we are all a part of the Drama Club and the Performing Arts Department, we understand the hard work and dedication it takes to put on these performances.

1618
02:48:40,492 --> 02:48:46,655
[SPEAKER_30]: This past weekend, we put on four performances of Mamma Mia along with 60 other students and entertained over 1,000 audience members.

1619
02:48:47,196 --> 02:48:52,258
[SPEAKER_30]: Despite the trouble the club has experienced this year with our advisors, we were still able to thrive and put on a very successful show.

1620
02:48:52,638 --> 02:48:55,180
[SPEAKER_30]: We would hate to see it fall apart as we've worked so hard to get where we are.

1621
02:48:55,200 --> 02:49:04,825
[SPEAKER_02]: In the four years that our seniors have been a part of the Drama Club, we've only had one year with a dedicated advisor stuck with us for the full school year.

1622
02:49:05,802 --> 02:49:09,867
[SPEAKER_02]: The Performing Arts Coordinator has been our one single consistent figure throughout these past four years.

1623
02:49:10,188 --> 02:49:14,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Without someone serving in this position, we would not have been capable of putting on the productions we do today.

1624
02:49:15,314 --> 02:49:20,221
[SPEAKER_02]: If these budget cuts pass, we will lose our most valuable representative and the entire Performing Arts Department is at risk.

1625
02:49:22,051 --> 02:49:26,794
[SPEAKER_18]: Along with the drama club, the marching band has also been extremely successful over the past four years.

1626
02:49:27,314 --> 02:49:35,078
[SPEAKER_18]: This fall, we won first place in our division and brought home the highest overall score throughout all five divisions, beating nationally ranked marching bands.

1627
02:49:35,718 --> 02:49:42,182
[SPEAKER_18]: The Medford High School Color Guard has also been consistently incredible and has been on the podium at every competition they have attended.

1628
02:49:43,323 --> 02:49:47,545
[SPEAKER_09]: The students that participate in these activities find community and learn lifelong skills at Medford High.

1629
02:49:48,157 --> 02:49:53,104
[SPEAKER_09]: All our seniors have a plan after high school, some moving straight into the workforce and others moving on to higher education.

1630
02:49:53,685 --> 02:49:57,931
[SPEAKER_09]: We even have our own drama club alumni, Jon and Topa, in front of us today.

1631
02:50:00,174 --> 02:50:06,597
[SPEAKER_03]: One of your main goals that you preach is to keep incoming ninth graders wanting to choose Medford High School over some of the private schools in the surrounding area.

1632
02:50:07,197 --> 02:50:10,158
[SPEAKER_03]: The arts here are one of the most impressive things that the school has to offer.

1633
02:50:10,578 --> 02:50:20,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Cutting the budget for a coordinator of this wonderful program is not the right thing to do, and losing all of these groups can overall lead to a severe decline in enrollment at Medford High School.

1634
02:50:20,823 --> 02:50:25,345
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we want and expect more students to enroll if the numbers of our faculty continue to decrease?

1635
02:50:27,113 --> 02:50:34,738
[SPEAKER_09]: All we ask before you commit to these decisions is to please realize the loss of the students and teachers at Medford High in all departments.

1636
02:50:35,218 --> 02:50:40,642
[SPEAKER_09]: These positions are crucial and without them, the foundation of our school, the foundation that helps so many students could fall apart.

1637
02:51:06,152 --> 02:51:06,812
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, students.

1638
02:51:07,413 --> 02:51:08,514
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a hard act to follow.

1639
02:51:10,695 --> 02:51:11,776
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Nora Lyman.

1640
02:51:12,176 --> 02:51:15,839
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm one of the guidance counselors at the McGlynn Middle School, one of two.

1641
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:22,463
[SPEAKER_15]: My position is the one that would be eliminated if the budget is passed as proposed.

1642
02:51:24,205 --> 02:51:27,647
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to speak a little bit about what the impacts would be about that today.

1643
02:51:28,942 --> 02:51:38,130
[SPEAKER_15]: Such a cut would mean that there would be one guidance counselor for grades six through eight and would double the caseload of that counselor to approximately 432 students.

1644
02:51:38,971 --> 02:51:47,019
[SPEAKER_15]: For the record, the American School Counselor Association recommends a ratio of 250 students to one guidance counselor.

1645
02:51:47,039 --> 02:51:52,744
[SPEAKER_15]: And many studies have been done that show that student outcomes are improved with that ratio.

1646
02:51:54,977 --> 02:52:03,062
[SPEAKER_15]: When you consider the day-to-day responsibilities of a guidance counselor, that 400 plus number is not just alarming, it's simply not feasible.

1647
02:52:04,042 --> 02:52:11,366
[SPEAKER_15]: As a guidance counselor in the middle school, we are responsible for teaching social emotional learning to students as a class in their schedule.

1648
02:52:12,067 --> 02:52:15,709
[SPEAKER_15]: One person logistically would not be able to do this for three grades.

1649
02:52:16,669 --> 02:52:22,372
[SPEAKER_15]: We also manage the 504 plans of students with disabilities like anxiety, depression, and ADHD.

1650
02:52:24,141 --> 02:52:29,523
[SPEAKER_15]: We meet with some of the school's most vulnerable students for one-to-one counseling and in small lunch groups.

1651
02:52:30,303 --> 02:52:38,286
[SPEAKER_15]: We are the trusted adults whose students come to when they are in crisis, and we work closely with teachers to support students who are struggling academically.

1652
02:52:39,446 --> 02:52:45,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Reducing the middle school to one guidance counselor would inevitably mean that students would fall through the cracks.

1653
02:52:46,005 --> 02:52:55,871
[SPEAKER_15]: One guidance counselor would simply not be able to respond to and support students with the appropriate level of care if they are tasked with a caseload of 400 plus students.

1654
02:52:56,392 --> 02:53:00,314
[SPEAKER_15]: You talk about work being left on the table, work would be left on the table.

1655
02:53:00,394 --> 02:53:02,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Students would not be got to.

1656
02:53:03,576 --> 02:53:11,061
[SPEAKER_15]: I chose to work in Medford because I was told that this was a district that valued and prioritized the social emotional well-being of its students.

1657
02:53:12,034 --> 02:53:23,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Eliminating this position as well as the cuts to the nursing staff sends a clear message to students, parents, and staff that Medford no longer cares about the mental health of its students.

1658
02:53:24,224 --> 02:53:24,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1659
02:53:24,624 --> 02:53:38,836
[SPEAKER_33]: That was good.

1660
02:53:40,009 --> 02:53:45,275
[SPEAKER_33]: All right, Anthony Yan, 45 Elm Hill Avenue in Levenston, Massachusetts, though I probably live here for the next five weeks.

1661
02:53:46,416 --> 02:53:48,478
[SPEAKER_33]: And I am the president of the Medford Teachers Association.

1662
02:53:49,439 --> 02:53:59,390
[SPEAKER_33]: I'd like to start by saying, one, happiness is appreciation week, and I could not find it more appropriate that it is also Teachers Appreciation Week.

1663
02:54:05,527 --> 02:54:14,071
[SPEAKER_33]: having been raised by a nurse and then having worked a good amount of my adult life to become a teacher, I can't think of another profession I'd rather be tied to than nurses.

1664
02:54:14,211 --> 02:54:16,392
[SPEAKER_33]: Y'all are the lifeblood of this entire society.

1665
02:54:22,974 --> 02:54:25,875
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm not gonna insult anyone's intelligence by dancing around it.

1666
02:54:25,916 --> 02:54:29,217
[SPEAKER_33]: This budget represents a free fall for Medford.

1667
02:54:30,998 --> 02:54:34,339
[SPEAKER_33]: And it's regressive in the face of increasing needs.

1668
02:54:35,748 --> 02:54:44,594
[SPEAKER_33]: We say there's an increase in the need for elementary teachers because there's an increase in not only the population, but the issues that our elementary school teachers are facing.

1669
02:54:44,634 --> 02:54:45,814
[SPEAKER_33]: They've stood in front of you all.

1670
02:54:46,255 --> 02:54:52,298
[SPEAKER_33]: Some of you members are new, but even in the short time you've been here, the elementary teachers have come here and said, we are facing hardships.

1671
02:54:52,338 --> 02:54:53,539
[SPEAKER_33]: We are facing physical abuse.

1672
02:54:53,579 --> 02:54:55,480
[SPEAKER_33]: We are facing mental struggles.

1673
02:54:56,241 --> 02:55:00,444
[SPEAKER_33]: And the idea that five positions had to be cut from that is appalling.

1674
02:55:02,158 --> 02:55:14,013
[SPEAKER_33]: At the middle schools, the decrease in guidance counselors, as Liz said, not only to service our students on 504s and IEPs, but to service students who do not have documented illnesses that still need to be dealt with, right?

1675
02:55:15,474 --> 02:55:17,397
[SPEAKER_33]: Or cognitive disabilities, I should say, I apologize.

1676
02:55:18,732 --> 02:55:23,736
[SPEAKER_33]: The week the musical happens, we then announced that we're cutting the theater after a year.

1677
02:55:23,976 --> 02:55:27,358
[SPEAKER_33]: And we can talk about low numbers, but we can also talk about this has only existed a year.

1678
02:55:28,019 --> 02:55:29,140
[SPEAKER_33]: Things need time to catch on.

1679
02:55:29,200 --> 02:55:32,402
[SPEAKER_33]: Students talk to other students and say, hey, this is great.

1680
02:55:32,982 --> 02:55:33,503
[SPEAKER_33]: You gotta do this.

1681
02:55:33,523 --> 02:55:34,784
[SPEAKER_33]: You're doing the musical, you should do this.

1682
02:55:37,385 --> 02:55:38,807
[SPEAKER_33]: We're trying to curtail absenteeism.

1683
02:55:38,987 --> 02:55:40,368
[SPEAKER_33]: We're trying to stop class cutting.

1684
02:55:40,568 --> 02:55:47,533
[SPEAKER_33]: We're trying to really take back the standards we had before COVID, and we're looking to cut administrative positions.

1685
02:55:48,669 --> 02:55:54,272
[SPEAKER_33]: or administrative assistant positions who are indispensable in attempting to curtail those issues.

1686
02:55:56,194 --> 02:55:58,815
[SPEAKER_33]: We're basing decisions on class enrollments, but it's May.

1687
02:56:00,236 --> 02:56:10,342
[SPEAKER_33]: Any high school teacher knows that those first three weeks are an absolute shuffle of students because they go in, they decide it's not for them, they wanna change, things happen, people enter the school.

1688
02:56:10,382 --> 02:56:16,526
[SPEAKER_33]: So I appreciate the budget has to get done, but to say that like we're looking at enrollment numbers in May is living a lie.

1689
02:56:19,286 --> 02:56:22,567
[SPEAKER_33]: The operations of the school are also never gonna be fully presented on paper.

1690
02:56:22,967 --> 02:56:27,227
[SPEAKER_33]: There's always going to be jobs that someone just does because they know that it has to get done.

1691
02:56:27,287 --> 02:56:28,528
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not part of the job description.

1692
02:56:29,108 --> 02:56:32,928
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not part of their, they weren't told to do it when they were hired.

1693
02:56:33,048 --> 02:56:34,749
[SPEAKER_33]: It's just, they saw a need, they filled it.

1694
02:56:34,809 --> 02:56:35,549
[SPEAKER_33]: They don't announce it.

1695
02:56:35,829 --> 02:56:37,829
[SPEAKER_33]: They don't ask payment for it.

1696
02:56:38,690 --> 02:56:42,330
[SPEAKER_33]: And once the position's gone, that's the only time people realize, oh, that person was doing that.

1697
02:56:42,770 --> 02:56:45,771
[SPEAKER_33]: And we can do as deep of a look into our job descriptions as you want.

1698
02:56:45,951 --> 02:56:46,771
[SPEAKER_33]: It's never gonna cover it.

1699
02:56:49,502 --> 02:56:56,567
[SPEAKER_33]: I just wanna end by saying, we're looking at what's being called the $5 million gap, but that $5 million gap is after these cuts.

1700
02:56:57,147 --> 02:57:00,009
[SPEAKER_33]: That doesn't mean like we're looking to fulfill $5 million.

1701
02:57:00,029 --> 02:57:04,872
[SPEAKER_33]: To fill that $5 million is to leave a short staff, that's not level budgeting.

1702
02:57:06,754 --> 02:57:10,096
[SPEAKER_33]: And I'll be the one to break the ice on it as far as this meeting goes.

1703
02:57:10,836 --> 02:57:13,578
[SPEAKER_33]: The most updated amount of free cash FY 2023,

1704
02:57:15,342 --> 02:57:18,823
[SPEAKER_33]: In Medford, we reported $25,469,513.

1705
02:57:18,883 --> 02:57:23,025
[SPEAKER_33]: That closes the gap in more.

1706
02:57:23,525 --> 02:57:26,066
[SPEAKER_33]: We don't have a real excuse to leave the schools this short.

1707
02:57:27,006 --> 02:57:31,708
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm asking for the students, I'm asking for my members, I'm asking for everybody in Medford.

1708
02:57:32,288 --> 02:57:35,770
[SPEAKER_33]: We gotta fund these schools, we gotta make sure these kids are safe, and we gotta push forward.

1709
02:57:36,230 --> 02:57:36,750
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you very much.

1710
02:57:49,295 --> 02:57:51,507
[SPEAKER_38]: Hello, David Zabner, 107 Bowdoin Street.

1711
02:57:54,544 --> 02:57:58,685
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm a PhD student at Tufts studying STEM education and a resident of Medford.

1712
02:57:59,606 --> 02:58:02,767
[SPEAKER_38]: Education, I think, is the most important thing city government does.

1713
02:58:03,527 --> 02:58:10,789
[SPEAKER_38]: And the story we heard tonight about the future of Medford, about what the Medford schools will look like in a year, in two years, in five years, is horrifying.

1714
02:58:12,090 --> 02:58:21,053
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm hoping to stay here after I graduate from my PhD, and I can't imagine staying and raising kids in a place where the schools are in free fall, like the story we just heard.

1715
02:58:23,127 --> 02:58:26,769
[SPEAKER_38]: So I'm really excited to hear what the plan is to close the $6 million gap.

1716
02:58:28,690 --> 02:58:40,137
[SPEAKER_38]: I felt like for two hours, I heard a story that had no silver lining, and then the mayor let us know that maybe there's a plan to do a Prop 2.5 override, to do a debt exclusion.

1717
02:58:40,617 --> 02:58:42,218
[SPEAKER_38]: And that seems like the silver lining.

1718
02:58:42,478 --> 02:58:49,482
[SPEAKER_38]: That seems like maybe an answer to not just next year's budget, but the next 10 years budget, the next 20 years budgets.

1719
02:58:52,045 --> 02:59:01,492
[SPEAKER_38]: because this is not something, it sounds like this $2.7 million of cuts would be barely survivable and the six would be destructive forever.

1720
02:59:02,512 --> 02:59:10,998
[SPEAKER_38]: So I'm really hopeful in November that we'll see legislation in front of the entire city that can solve this problem in the longterm.

1721
02:59:11,018 --> 02:59:17,282
[SPEAKER_38]: And I'm excited to knock doors for that and to vote for that and to see a stronger Medford going forward.

1722
02:59:17,523 --> 02:59:17,763
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1723
02:59:24,775 --> 02:59:25,055
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1724
02:59:25,075 --> 02:59:26,155
[SPEAKER_21]: Name and address for the record, please.

1725
02:59:26,496 --> 02:59:28,036
[SPEAKER_37]: David Sayers, 19 Park Street.

1726
02:59:28,836 --> 02:59:37,619
[SPEAKER_37]: If we want to see enrollment numbers go up, if we want to see test scores go up, if we want to see real academic achievement go up, we have to invest in our students.

1727
02:59:38,059 --> 02:59:41,600
[SPEAKER_37]: And that starts by investing in our teachers and our staff, not cutting them.

1728
02:59:43,496 --> 03:00:01,782
[SPEAKER_37]: In addition, there have been numerous studies that showed the link between the arts, including the performing arts, and increased academic achievement and decreased behavioral issues, not to mention the social emotion and leadership skills the students learned, as exemplified by the students that spoke here just a little bit ago.

1729
03:00:03,012 --> 03:00:10,776
[SPEAKER_37]: Now, if I came to you and said there was a way of increasing academic achievement and decreasing disciplinary issues, you'd think you'd all jump on it.

1730
03:00:11,236 --> 03:00:13,237
[SPEAKER_37]: And it doesn't actually cost anything.

1731
03:00:13,297 --> 03:00:16,239
[SPEAKER_37]: It just means not cutting the performing arts at Medford High School.

1732
03:00:17,259 --> 03:00:23,422
[SPEAKER_37]: Now, as everyone here knows, if you have a budget deficit, you either have to make cuts or you have to increase income.

1733
03:00:23,962 --> 03:00:28,685
[SPEAKER_37]: As a Medford taxpayer, I support raising taxes to cover this budget deficit.

1734
03:00:37,734 --> 03:00:39,515
[SPEAKER_22]: I thank you for letting us speak tonight.

1735
03:00:39,935 --> 03:00:41,436
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Mary Jo Petroni.

1736
03:00:41,456 --> 03:00:46,019
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm the president of the Administrative Assistance Unit.

1737
03:00:46,219 --> 03:00:52,103
[SPEAKER_22]: I live at 12 Greenhalgh Street in Medford, and I have been here for 24 years.

1738
03:00:53,684 --> 03:00:55,946
[SPEAKER_22]: So first I'd like to thank Ms.

1739
03:00:55,986 --> 03:01:06,477
[SPEAKER_22]: Brandley because you brought forward many of my, you bought my balloon because many of the points that I was going to bring up came from you because you brought very poignant issues, as did all of you.

1740
03:01:06,537 --> 03:01:07,398
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate it.

1741
03:01:08,159 --> 03:01:09,960
[SPEAKER_22]: I know this is a difficult decision.

1742
03:01:09,980 --> 03:01:13,124
[SPEAKER_22]: I would not want to be the budget person here.

1743
03:01:15,157 --> 03:01:18,259
[SPEAKER_22]: A budget means we have to look at where else we can cut.

1744
03:01:18,300 --> 03:01:26,386
[SPEAKER_22]: We can't continue to cut the same secretaries, teachers, nurses, paraprofessionals, wherever we look.

1745
03:01:26,446 --> 03:01:27,687
[SPEAKER_22]: We have to look somewhere else.

1746
03:01:28,287 --> 03:01:38,055
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't know if it's like, hey, I understand this is, in the real world, someone says, hey, maybe I'll take, I won't take my pay cut, my pay raise, I'll defer it.

1747
03:01:38,235 --> 03:01:39,976
[SPEAKER_22]: I heard that brought up by you as well.

1748
03:01:40,877 --> 03:01:55,579
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to answer an interesting thing was we discussed how important this payroll human resource pieces and additional people in 2010 we had another very, very difficult year with a lot of changes, we laid off a lot of people.

1749
03:01:56,542 --> 03:02:00,203
[SPEAKER_22]: and I was part of the reorganization.

1750
03:02:00,663 --> 03:02:01,644
[SPEAKER_22]: I worked in payroll.

1751
03:02:02,304 --> 03:02:03,764
[SPEAKER_22]: I was the backup person.

1752
03:02:04,244 --> 03:02:05,785
[SPEAKER_22]: I could do everyone's payroll.

1753
03:02:06,305 --> 03:02:18,809
[SPEAKER_22]: I entered everything, and then I did the MTRS report, and I also do student activities, which is not payroll, but I did anything and everything that they asked me to do, took on grants.

1754
03:02:19,129 --> 03:02:20,609
[SPEAKER_22]: They would come and say, can you do this?

1755
03:02:21,169 --> 03:02:23,130
[SPEAKER_22]: And as somebody said, we just did it.

1756
03:02:23,550 --> 03:02:24,993
[SPEAKER_22]: We didn't think twice about it.

1757
03:02:25,013 --> 03:02:26,496
[SPEAKER_22]: We didn't think, I need more money.

1758
03:02:26,577 --> 03:02:32,108
[SPEAKER_22]: We just said, yes, because it's for the students, the staff, and the families.

1759
03:02:33,169 --> 03:02:42,859
[SPEAKER_22]: I was reallocated, I was brought in, nicely brought in and said, hey, we need you to take everything you do and just go sit at a different desk and do that.

1760
03:02:43,279 --> 03:02:46,682
[SPEAKER_22]: And I picked up my, I rolled it down the hallway, and that's what I did.

1761
03:02:46,702 --> 03:02:54,190
[SPEAKER_22]: And I still helped out in payroll, and I still did MTRS reporting, and I helped out in the buildings, and I did the buildings and grounds.

1762
03:02:54,750 --> 03:03:04,434
[SPEAKER_22]: That job has become immense at this point, so I don't do MTRS anymore because I was told by a previous person, it shouldn't be me that does it.

1763
03:03:04,534 --> 03:03:06,835
[SPEAKER_22]: It should be another person in the payroll office.

1764
03:03:07,495 --> 03:03:10,597
[SPEAKER_22]: We know that we have a payroll person on maternity leave.

1765
03:03:11,017 --> 03:03:13,838
[SPEAKER_22]: In October, that was brought to the finance department.

1766
03:03:14,338 --> 03:03:16,759
[SPEAKER_22]: And our union said, hey, we need to post this.

1767
03:03:17,099 --> 03:03:20,819
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to get something figured out, because this person is going to be gone.

1768
03:03:21,580 --> 03:03:23,740
[SPEAKER_22]: She had her baby in February, unfortunately.

1769
03:03:24,220 --> 03:03:25,140
[SPEAKER_22]: She went on bed rest.

1770
03:03:25,220 --> 03:03:27,701
[SPEAKER_22]: So in December, nothing had been done.

1771
03:03:27,721 --> 03:03:29,081
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was a scramble.

1772
03:03:29,241 --> 03:03:30,501
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't like scrambles.

1773
03:03:30,721 --> 03:03:32,902
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Rousseau, you don't like scrambles.

1774
03:03:33,542 --> 03:03:34,902
[SPEAKER_22]: I like it organized.

1775
03:03:34,982 --> 03:03:38,423
[SPEAKER_22]: We knew, we addressed it, and we didn't get an answer.

1776
03:03:39,505 --> 03:03:47,509
[SPEAKER_22]: My biggest, biggest concern, and you brought this up, as did others, is safety at the McGlynn School and at all schools.

1777
03:03:48,090 --> 03:03:52,652
[SPEAKER_22]: We've had illnesses that came through, and I was one of the secretaries that had to be out for a long time.

1778
03:03:53,132 --> 03:03:57,434
[SPEAKER_22]: We've had illnesses in our unit, and we've all had to help out wherever we could.

1779
03:03:58,435 --> 03:03:59,676
[SPEAKER_22]: But the problem is

1780
03:04:00,646 --> 03:04:04,630
[SPEAKER_22]: When a parent calls up and says, my car broke down.

1781
03:04:04,810 --> 03:04:05,691
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to be late.

1782
03:04:06,071 --> 03:04:11,356
[SPEAKER_22]: And John is going to be sitting in your office, there's a secretary that goes, don't worry about it.

1783
03:04:11,836 --> 03:04:12,557
[SPEAKER_22]: I got it covered.

1784
03:04:12,577 --> 03:04:13,337
[SPEAKER_22]: You want a snack?

1785
03:04:13,457 --> 03:04:14,238
[SPEAKER_22]: How about a drink?

1786
03:04:14,699 --> 03:04:15,880
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the person.

1787
03:04:16,280 --> 03:04:23,727
[SPEAKER_22]: But if a girl calls out sick, and no one's in the office, and the administration is supposed to be covering it, and they're busy dismissing students,

1788
03:04:24,187 --> 03:04:25,408
[SPEAKER_22]: Johnny's like freaking out.

1789
03:04:25,448 --> 03:04:26,169
[SPEAKER_22]: Where's my mother?

1790
03:04:26,209 --> 03:04:27,129
[SPEAKER_22]: Where's my grandmother?

1791
03:04:27,529 --> 03:04:33,434
[SPEAKER_22]: I covered at the McGlynn School and that was a big, I never realized all those pieces of where's my grandmother?

1792
03:04:33,454 --> 03:04:34,895
[SPEAKER_22]: Why hasn't she shown up yet?

1793
03:04:35,315 --> 03:04:36,816
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's a big concern.

1794
03:04:37,497 --> 03:04:42,981
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, because I work at Medford High School and I'm in the buildings office, I happen to have a walkie talkie.

1795
03:04:43,461 --> 03:04:48,485
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm able to hear the needs that are in during lunchtime and all other times.

1796
03:04:49,125 --> 03:05:01,191
[SPEAKER_22]: There is a lot of students that are sent to assistant principal's office because they need to separate from where they are for safety reasons and more not for major safety reasons, but because they need a break.

1797
03:05:01,271 --> 03:05:03,572
[SPEAKER_22]: They need to walk somewhere.

1798
03:05:04,893 --> 03:05:13,157
[SPEAKER_22]: Those administrative assistants in the assistant principal's office or even in the guidance office are welcoming to these students and they let them sit.

1799
03:05:13,257 --> 03:05:18,400
[SPEAKER_22]: They don't discuss anything with them, but they have a place to go and they're supervised.

1800
03:05:19,574 --> 03:05:24,077
[SPEAKER_22]: Guidance and nursing combined, I don't understand how you're going to do it.

1801
03:05:24,478 --> 03:05:28,601
[SPEAKER_22]: Because right now, in the beginning of the year, guidance is busy with college fair.

1802
03:05:28,881 --> 03:05:30,682
[SPEAKER_22]: Then they're signing up for AP exams.

1803
03:05:30,982 --> 03:05:35,065
[SPEAKER_22]: Then they're taking the PSATs.

1804
03:05:35,546 --> 03:05:39,509
[SPEAKER_22]: Now they're doing letters, mailings, any applications.

1805
03:05:40,069 --> 03:05:41,210
[SPEAKER_22]: Applications have to be done.

1806
03:05:41,710 --> 03:05:46,113
[SPEAKER_22]: And the nursing office is constantly dealing with purchase orders, things we need.

1807
03:05:46,133 --> 03:05:47,294
[SPEAKER_22]: We're short on this supply.

1808
03:05:47,334 --> 03:05:48,395
[SPEAKER_22]: We're short on that supply.

1809
03:05:48,775 --> 03:05:55,619
[SPEAKER_22]: So there are two very important jobs that when you combine them, one, something's going to fall through the cracks.

1810
03:05:56,220 --> 03:05:57,661
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, who's going to get hurt?

1811
03:05:58,141 --> 03:06:00,543
[SPEAKER_22]: Students, families, and staff.

1812
03:06:01,023 --> 03:06:05,866
[SPEAKER_22]: So what I ask is that you think about the problems that we're facing.

1813
03:06:06,667 --> 03:06:08,388
[SPEAKER_22]: And I understand you're looking for money.

1814
03:06:08,448 --> 03:06:09,729
[SPEAKER_22]: We are all looking for money.

1815
03:06:11,127 --> 03:06:15,051
[SPEAKER_22]: don't know whether an override is gonna work in this city, I'm not sure.

1816
03:06:15,651 --> 03:06:21,156
[SPEAKER_22]: But the problem is, I think you have a rainy day fund that you can start and then you can figure out how to do it from there.

1817
03:06:21,677 --> 03:06:32,546
[SPEAKER_22]: But from that point on, we just honestly need to pay attention to what's happened in the past because the jobs that you're saying in HR, those are union jobs.

1818
03:06:32,887 --> 03:06:34,408
[SPEAKER_22]: So at 150,000, you actually can hire three people.

1819
03:06:37,153 --> 03:06:40,915
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm saying, and also, maybe we have to train people.

1820
03:06:40,955 --> 03:06:41,995
[SPEAKER_22]: We've asked for this.

1821
03:06:42,416 --> 03:06:43,416
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's cross-train.

1822
03:06:43,456 --> 03:06:56,983
[SPEAKER_22]: It's been brought up for three assistant superintendents at Reinfinance, and we never got the opportunity because they never take the time to give us a break, say, hey, during this time, we're going to start to train.

1823
03:06:57,443 --> 03:06:59,004
[SPEAKER_22]: Payroll is a very busy job.

1824
03:06:59,384 --> 03:07:01,445
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's very doable, and it's something I've done.

1825
03:07:01,465 --> 03:07:03,346
[SPEAKER_22]: And I learned it on the job.

1826
03:07:03,426 --> 03:07:04,106
[SPEAKER_22]: I sat there.

1827
03:07:04,146 --> 03:07:04,767
[SPEAKER_22]: I did things.

1828
03:07:04,827 --> 03:07:06,868
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think there's ways to do that.

1829
03:07:07,348 --> 03:07:12,250
[SPEAKER_22]: But hiring two new people in that field, you're still going to be.

1830
03:07:12,290 --> 03:07:17,253
[SPEAKER_22]: So maybe you're saving some of my secretaries that are being told they don't have a job next year.

1831
03:07:17,273 --> 03:07:18,593
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's a bonus for me.

1832
03:07:18,613 --> 03:07:20,014
[SPEAKER_22]: I thank you for that.

1833
03:07:20,474 --> 03:07:24,256
[SPEAKER_22]: But the reporting, the payroll, those are things that have been done.

1834
03:07:24,296 --> 03:07:25,517
[SPEAKER_22]: And they did cut it once.

1835
03:07:25,777 --> 03:07:27,558
[SPEAKER_22]: And they realized the mistake they made.

1836
03:07:28,078 --> 03:07:29,840
[SPEAKER_22]: Because now we're all of a sudden freaking out.

1837
03:07:29,920 --> 03:07:32,462
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, there's much more things that have to be done now.

1838
03:07:32,882 --> 03:07:35,505
[SPEAKER_22]: And you're right about the two systems not talking to each other.

1839
03:07:35,985 --> 03:07:38,787
[SPEAKER_22]: Also correct that people aren't getting answers to their questions.

1840
03:07:38,907 --> 03:07:39,928
[SPEAKER_22]: I hear it all the time.

1841
03:07:40,509 --> 03:07:42,811
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think we have to be able to do that.

1842
03:07:42,971 --> 03:07:50,638
[SPEAKER_22]: And maybe that's, hopefully that's something that Dr. Vinson is thinking about and working on with Jerry and Noel.

1843
03:07:50,778 --> 03:07:51,939
[SPEAKER_22]: I know it's a difficult thing.

1844
03:07:52,379 --> 03:07:54,220
[SPEAKER_22]: But we are here to help.

1845
03:07:54,820 --> 03:08:00,802
[SPEAKER_22]: Never have you ever heard from my unit, I have to say this, I'm not doing that, it's not my job.

1846
03:08:01,322 --> 03:08:03,243
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't say it's not my job.

1847
03:08:03,723 --> 03:08:08,284
[SPEAKER_22]: We say, okay, we're gonna get it done, we just gotta figure out how we can squeeze it into the day.

1848
03:08:08,704 --> 03:08:14,206
[SPEAKER_22]: Because we are here to serve students and families and staff, that's why we're here.

1849
03:08:14,466 --> 03:08:16,787
[SPEAKER_22]: We could be somewhere else doing a lot of different work.

1850
03:08:17,287 --> 03:08:18,187
[SPEAKER_22]: We're here for them.

1851
03:08:18,707 --> 03:08:21,588
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're here because you're, just like you are, to serve people.

1852
03:08:21,988 --> 03:08:22,649
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you.

1853
03:08:22,689 --> 03:08:22,989
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1854
03:08:32,291 --> 03:08:36,193
[SPEAKER_31]: Hello, my name is Gia Russo and my address is 132 Grand Ave.

1855
03:08:37,133 --> 03:08:39,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, my name is Sophia D'Amelio and my address is 275 Boston Ave.

1856
03:08:41,735 --> 03:08:47,219
[SPEAKER_31]: As a junior at Medford High School and also class vice president, I've seen firsthand my classmates' concerns.

1857
03:08:47,860 --> 03:08:51,882
[SPEAKER_31]: Students' education is what comes first and it's what's being compromised due to this budget cut.

1858
03:08:52,783 --> 03:09:02,710
[SPEAKER_31]: Alongside cutting vital administration positions such as our nurses, cutting staff who help make our sports and clubs possible will cause a decline in students' ability to thrive.

1859
03:09:03,110 --> 03:09:07,353
[SPEAKER_31]: Please put our students and our ability to succeed first.

1860
03:09:09,489 --> 03:09:14,250
[SPEAKER_04]: So quite frankly, when I came here, I didn't really know what I was going to say and I didn't really plan anything.

1861
03:09:14,771 --> 03:09:26,234
[SPEAKER_04]: But after hearing the nurses talk about them being cut, the guidance department being cut in the middle schools, I think that I've realized all of these things tie directly straight to our mental health in school.

1862
03:09:26,654 --> 03:09:30,235
[SPEAKER_04]: And after hearing the drama club and possibly the sports might be cut,

1863
03:09:31,758 --> 03:09:34,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this all directly ties to mental health.

1864
03:09:34,299 --> 03:09:41,643
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't imagine having a problem and not being able to go to my guidance counselor when there's three other kids waiting.

1865
03:09:42,023 --> 03:09:46,205
[SPEAKER_04]: And I couldn't imagine not being able to play lacrosse or gymnastics after school.

1866
03:09:46,225 --> 03:09:54,909
[SPEAKER_04]: And especially for my brother, who has special needs, and he really enjoys playing adaptive basketball and unified track, which brings him a lot of joy.

1867
03:09:54,929 --> 03:09:57,590
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think mental health matters everywhere.

1868
03:09:57,690 --> 03:09:59,251
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think I really realize this.

1869
03:10:00,271 --> 03:10:04,474
[SPEAKER_04]: until COVID, but I think I understand there needs to be cuts made.

1870
03:10:04,915 --> 03:10:05,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do.

1871
03:10:06,015 --> 03:10:24,249
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just think we need to find a better place to make these cuts and like work together because I don't think we can be cutting from the guidance department and nurses when mental health is such a big issue for everybody, the students, the teachers, our families, like there's something else we have to do.

1872
03:10:24,269 --> 03:10:25,410
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

1873
03:10:25,650 --> 03:10:25,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1874
03:10:36,056 --> 03:10:41,618
[SPEAKER_23]: So, Charlene Douglas, 414 High Street, Medford, Mass.

1875
03:10:42,839 --> 03:10:46,440
[SPEAKER_23]: To say that these cuts are devastating is, I don't even have to say it.

1876
03:10:46,700 --> 03:10:49,922
[SPEAKER_23]: To say that we have the shortfall, you know, our students have said it.

1877
03:10:50,382 --> 03:11:00,466
[SPEAKER_23]: This school committee, this administration, and the mayor have prided themselves on working towards social, emotional well-being of our students.

1878
03:11:01,186 --> 03:11:05,008
[SPEAKER_23]: Yet today, there is a proposal to cut from the,

1879
03:11:05,919 --> 03:11:16,447
[SPEAKER_23]: the nurses, the guidance counselors, the arts, those things that are so important to one's social-emotional learning.

1880
03:11:17,428 --> 03:11:25,774
[SPEAKER_23]: And you sit here and you say, I want that, you vote this budget in, and you allow those cuts to happen, shame on you.

1881
03:11:26,475 --> 03:11:28,036
[SPEAKER_23]: But this isn't social-emotional.

1882
03:11:28,416 --> 03:11:30,058
[SPEAKER_23]: We need social-emotional.

1883
03:11:30,398 --> 03:11:32,119
[SPEAKER_23]: We need secretaries.

1884
03:11:32,460 --> 03:11:33,901
[SPEAKER_23]: We need nurses.

1885
03:11:35,060 --> 03:11:40,542
[SPEAKER_23]: I went to a school when I was young, and there was never a nurse, and I was very poor.

1886
03:11:41,902 --> 03:11:43,743
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't get glasses until I was 40.

1887
03:11:45,223 --> 03:11:46,864
[SPEAKER_23]: I suffered headaches my whole life.

1888
03:11:47,944 --> 03:11:50,385
[SPEAKER_23]: When I was 40, I said, I can't do this anymore.

1889
03:11:51,566 --> 03:11:52,786
[SPEAKER_23]: And because I had a real job,

1890
03:11:54,070 --> 03:11:56,531
[SPEAKER_23]: That's when I found out that I had a stigma.

1891
03:11:57,052 --> 03:11:59,974
[SPEAKER_23]: But there was never anyone there because we didn't have it.

1892
03:12:00,274 --> 03:12:07,498
[SPEAKER_23]: So reverting back to the 1950s and 60s and 70s, is that what we're reverting back to?

1893
03:12:08,159 --> 03:12:08,659
[SPEAKER_23]: I hope not.

1894
03:12:10,063 --> 03:12:13,486
[SPEAKER_23]: The other thing is, Mr. Rousseau, you made a very good point tonight.

1895
03:12:14,086 --> 03:12:20,731
[SPEAKER_23]: We hold money aside for raises, and then we go a whole year without it, and that money goes back to the city.

1896
03:12:21,492 --> 03:12:23,053
[SPEAKER_23]: My question is to you, Madam Mayor.

1897
03:12:23,953 --> 03:12:34,841
[SPEAKER_23]: That money that goes back to the city, has that gone into that free cash account where it's $25 million in there, which normally is anywhere between 12, 15 max?

1898
03:12:35,222 --> 03:12:36,202
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a lot of money in there.

1899
03:12:37,043 --> 03:12:38,744
[SPEAKER_23]: I understand you want an override.

1900
03:12:39,224 --> 03:12:40,725
[SPEAKER_23]: And I can even maybe think about that.

1901
03:12:41,365 --> 03:12:45,207
[SPEAKER_23]: But until, we can't wait for an override to happen.

1902
03:12:45,587 --> 03:12:46,988
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're not gonna get that on the ballot.

1903
03:12:47,188 --> 03:12:48,489
[SPEAKER_23]: And everyone knows that here.

1904
03:12:49,709 --> 03:12:50,029
[SPEAKER_23]: Correct?

1905
03:12:50,750 --> 03:12:52,450
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not gonna happen, it's not realistic.

1906
03:12:53,331 --> 03:12:54,231
[SPEAKER_23]: There's free cash.

1907
03:12:54,691 --> 03:13:05,657
[SPEAKER_23]: I ask that you look at that free cash, you funds our school appropriately, and then you bring forward to the, in an intelligent manner, why we need an override.

1908
03:13:06,607 --> 03:13:07,809
[SPEAKER_23]: and get everyone on board.

1909
03:13:09,391 --> 03:13:11,454
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't just say, we need an override.

1910
03:13:11,474 --> 03:13:13,177
[SPEAKER_23]: We've been hearing this for a very long time.

1911
03:13:13,577 --> 03:13:14,699
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm not saying we don't.

1912
03:13:15,280 --> 03:13:18,545
[SPEAKER_23]: I think my taxes are exuberant in Metric, okay?

1913
03:13:18,825 --> 03:13:19,967
[SPEAKER_23]: But it is what it is.

1914
03:13:21,249 --> 03:13:22,411
[SPEAKER_23]: The taxes are exuberant.

1915
03:13:23,752 --> 03:13:25,913
[SPEAKER_23]: Revenue, businesses, Memphis Square.

1916
03:13:26,453 --> 03:13:33,536
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm very, I mean I went to a breakfast the other morning with a group of friends of mine, and there was so, there's nothing there anymore.

1917
03:13:34,216 --> 03:13:35,837
[SPEAKER_23]: We actually went to Winchester Center.

1918
03:13:36,217 --> 03:13:41,419
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's bring up the businesses, let's look at things we can do, and really improve this city.

1919
03:13:42,559 --> 03:13:50,322
[SPEAKER_23]: And do not, do not balance your budget on the backs of students and their social emotional health.

1920
03:13:50,602 --> 03:13:52,063
[SPEAKER_23]: That's all I have to say, thank you.

1921
03:14:01,730 --> 03:14:03,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, some of you know me, my name is Sarah Moshave.

1922
03:14:03,672 --> 03:14:05,393
[SPEAKER_11]: I live at Three Fells View Ave.

1923
03:14:05,413 --> 03:14:05,874
[SPEAKER_11]: in Medford.

1924
03:14:06,414 --> 03:14:10,838
[SPEAKER_11]: I am the Adjustment Counselor for K-5, and I love my job.

1925
03:14:11,378 --> 03:14:14,220
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm also the Drama Advisor for Medfin Middle Schools.

1926
03:14:15,021 --> 03:14:16,282
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanted to sort of just sit here.

1927
03:14:16,342 --> 03:14:22,768
[SPEAKER_11]: I liked what some of you said, especially Mr. Olopade, I think Nicole, you went on this too, and I won't talk long because I will get emotional.

1928
03:14:24,208 --> 03:14:31,190
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanted to give you a couple of examples of a day in a life that I think will support my fellow nurses and my fellow counselors, because I think that's a good thing to think about.

1929
03:14:31,870 --> 03:14:33,150
[SPEAKER_11]: And today was a good example.

1930
03:14:33,250 --> 03:14:40,192
[SPEAKER_11]: So we had an ambulance first thing in the morning, which set kindergartners off, which had every one of us trying to help and support these kids.

1931
03:14:41,572 --> 03:14:49,594
[SPEAKER_11]: At lunchtime, I had a group of three kids who have various disorders, mental health issues, and I was doing that.

1932
03:14:50,134 --> 03:14:52,755
[SPEAKER_11]: One kid squirted hot empanada sauce

1933
03:14:53,291 --> 03:14:54,152
[SPEAKER_11]: all over his thing.

1934
03:14:54,212 --> 03:15:00,158
[SPEAKER_11]: At the same time, I had my nurses at my door because one of my other students was having a panic attack in the nurse's office.

1935
03:15:00,518 --> 03:15:03,681
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I had another kid crying on the floor in the caf.

1936
03:15:03,962 --> 03:15:06,785
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was balancing all these things, and we all had to support each other.

1937
03:15:07,485 --> 03:15:16,855
[SPEAKER_11]: And with less people, that kid would have still been alone crying the whole time on the cafeteria floor with his head between his knees.

1938
03:15:18,345 --> 03:15:27,989
[SPEAKER_11]: my social skills group with the kid crying because he burnt his mouth and the cheese would be crying all by himself because I had to go support the kid in the nurse's office who was having a panic attack.

1939
03:15:28,609 --> 03:15:31,470
[SPEAKER_11]: So all these kids would not get the support they need.

1940
03:15:31,990 --> 03:15:38,413
[SPEAKER_11]: And one more story to sort of support the drama kids, and I wish they were still here, and it also supports Ms.

1941
03:15:38,453 --> 03:15:44,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Lyman's words, is I happen to be talking points of parents, and I heard some kids crying in the hallway.

1942
03:15:45,890 --> 03:15:48,011
[SPEAKER_11]: One guidance counselor was teaching a guidance class.

1943
03:15:48,331 --> 03:15:52,192
[SPEAKER_11]: The other one had a social skills group with like six million kids in her office.

1944
03:15:52,912 --> 03:15:54,232
[SPEAKER_11]: And these two kids are crying.

1945
03:15:54,692 --> 03:15:55,512
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, come on in.

1946
03:15:55,772 --> 03:15:56,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me talk about it.

1947
03:15:56,492 --> 03:15:57,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about it.

1948
03:15:57,653 --> 03:15:59,973
[SPEAKER_11]: One was having anxiety about a math test.

1949
03:16:00,953 --> 03:16:05,494
[SPEAKER_11]: So I got her calm down enough to go back to math, but I knew this kid was also an actor.

1950
03:16:06,115 --> 03:16:07,515
[SPEAKER_11]: So I said, at least you have drama.

1951
03:16:08,713 --> 03:16:11,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, drama's not going to happen because she quit.

1952
03:16:11,837 --> 03:16:13,219
[SPEAKER_11]: So now I became the drama teacher.

1953
03:16:13,419 --> 03:16:15,101
[SPEAKER_11]: So we all support each other.

1954
03:16:15,682 --> 03:16:17,524
[SPEAKER_11]: And I had 135 kids sign up for drama this year.

1955
03:16:20,467 --> 03:16:27,072
[SPEAKER_11]: So a high school is going to have a lot of these kids, and I see them light up.

1956
03:16:27,813 --> 03:16:31,715
[SPEAKER_11]: And I stay after school three times a week, and they just light up.

1957
03:16:32,136 --> 03:16:38,140
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would hate, hate, hate to see that disappear, because this saves these kids, and it saved me in high school.

1958
03:16:38,380 --> 03:16:38,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1959
03:16:48,502 --> 03:16:52,484
[SPEAKER_25]: Michelle Hardy, 59 4th Street.

1960
03:16:53,244 --> 03:16:54,625
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm the vice president of the Mesa.

1961
03:16:55,285 --> 03:16:56,146
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm the former president.

1962
03:16:57,006 --> 03:16:58,107
[SPEAKER_25]: I didn't prepare anything.

1963
03:16:58,147 --> 03:17:05,511
[SPEAKER_25]: I just like scribbled as I was walking up here, but I'd really like you to take the McGlynn elementary and middle school into consideration.

1964
03:17:06,271 --> 03:17:08,192
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm an elementary secretary at the Brooks.

1965
03:17:08,452 --> 03:17:09,293
[SPEAKER_25]: I have 500, just under 550 kids.

1966
03:17:09,313 --> 03:17:10,273
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't imagine a daily

1967
03:17:15,151 --> 03:17:18,753
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't imagine being there daily with 1,000 kids taken care of.

1968
03:17:18,773 --> 03:17:19,954
[SPEAKER_25]: It's more than just filing.

1969
03:17:19,994 --> 03:17:21,755
[SPEAKER_25]: It's more than just answering the telephones.

1970
03:17:22,916 --> 03:17:26,178
[SPEAKER_25]: During report card time, we're proofreading the report cards for them.

1971
03:17:26,218 --> 03:17:27,178
[SPEAKER_25]: We're printing the report cards.

1972
03:17:27,198 --> 03:17:28,459
[SPEAKER_25]: We're stuffing the envelopes.

1973
03:17:29,200 --> 03:17:33,222
[SPEAKER_25]: Sometimes it takes me two days because the copy machine is not working and the internet is down.

1974
03:17:34,483 --> 03:17:41,827
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'd really like you to maybe go and visit the McGlynn and just see how busy they are, both of them.

1975
03:17:44,366 --> 03:17:44,906
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's see.

1976
03:17:46,267 --> 03:17:47,528
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to finish now.

1977
03:17:47,548 --> 03:17:48,768
[SPEAKER_25]: Just Lane's going to finish for us.

1978
03:17:49,129 --> 03:17:52,611
[SPEAKER_25]: But along with the nurses, we kind of are the backbones of the school.

1979
03:17:53,251 --> 03:17:57,413
[SPEAKER_25]: And I don't feel like we get respected enough and taken seriously.

1980
03:17:58,174 --> 03:17:59,515
[SPEAKER_25]: We're always kind of pushed back.

1981
03:18:02,116 --> 03:18:02,496
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1982
03:18:02,556 --> 03:18:03,077
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you all.

1983
03:18:03,477 --> 03:18:03,777
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1984
03:18:04,597 --> 03:18:10,441
[SPEAKER_24]: To follow Michelle's comments, I did cover the McGlynn for two days while both admin assistants were out.

1985
03:18:11,578 --> 03:18:21,046
[SPEAKER_24]: for the week and I can say that it's really wonderful to say that someone's going to come and pitch in and let you run to the ladies room or actually have a lunch.

1986
03:18:21,126 --> 03:18:24,029
[SPEAKER_24]: In the two days that I was there, that did not happen once.

1987
03:18:25,150 --> 03:18:27,192
[SPEAKER_24]: I had to close the office if I needed to leave.

1988
03:18:29,582 --> 03:18:38,424
[SPEAKER_24]: So while realistically, on paper, you can put down a floater, you can put someone else down there and they can support the school, it's unrealistic, especially for safety purposes.

1989
03:18:38,865 --> 03:18:42,826
[SPEAKER_24]: They are two school, they're just about 1,000 students.

1990
03:18:43,886 --> 03:18:54,348
[SPEAKER_24]: Out of all the positions that are proposed being cut, that is probably one of the most important, as is our AP admin assistant at the high school.

1991
03:18:54,708 --> 03:18:56,749
[SPEAKER_24]: You have discussed that you will not be cutting

1992
03:18:57,639 --> 03:19:04,342
[SPEAKER_24]: the assistant principals, but yet two admin assistants now have to take on the work, right?

1993
03:19:04,742 --> 03:19:14,747
[SPEAKER_24]: Someone has to do the work, which means that person or both of them will have to split the work without any further compensation, right?

1994
03:19:15,586 --> 03:19:24,351
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, I see that we're looking at adding the payroll and human resource positions, which the work is union work.

1995
03:19:24,831 --> 03:19:28,053
[SPEAKER_24]: But as it's proposed here, that doesn't look like they're union positions.

1996
03:19:28,493 --> 03:19:32,535
[SPEAKER_24]: But yet, out of the six, that's not our, we don't make that much money.

1997
03:19:33,436 --> 03:19:41,960
[SPEAKER_24]: Out of the six positions that you have decided to cut, which we are by seniority, which are the bottom six, you have a payroll position that is being cut.

1998
03:19:42,541 --> 03:19:45,062
[SPEAKER_24]: So are we bringing that back as a non-unit position?

1999
03:19:46,923 --> 03:19:48,124
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a concern for the union.

2000
03:19:49,004 --> 03:19:52,666
[SPEAKER_24]: That just shows us how we are undervalued in this district.

2001
03:20:02,008 --> 03:20:03,109
[SPEAKER_25]: So they won't be in our union.

2002
03:20:03,249 --> 03:20:06,171
[SPEAKER_24]: But they'll be doing our work.

2003
03:20:06,311 --> 03:20:07,131
[SPEAKER_24]: They'll be doing our work.

2004
03:20:07,332 --> 03:20:07,892
[SPEAKER_24]: That's good to know.

2005
03:20:08,212 --> 03:20:11,454
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, I am a parent in the district, and I'm very concerned.

2006
03:20:11,534 --> 03:20:14,136
[SPEAKER_24]: I keep hearing that middle and high school numbers are down.

2007
03:20:14,536 --> 03:20:21,101
[SPEAKER_24]: If you keep eliminating positions, if you keep eliminating programs, why should we send our kids here?

2008
03:20:22,342 --> 03:20:22,622
[SPEAKER_24]: Why?

2009
03:20:23,683 --> 03:20:30,087
[SPEAKER_24]: We can easily have them go to a private school where they will be offered all these opportunities.

2010
03:20:32,847 --> 03:20:33,828
[SPEAKER_24]: I just, food for thought.

2011
03:20:34,648 --> 03:20:44,433
[SPEAKER_24]: I think, you know, as a parent, we want security, but we also want our children to be offered everything that their peers are being offered in Somerville, in Cambridge, in Malden.

2012
03:20:45,893 --> 03:20:47,034
[SPEAKER_24]: We're taking away from them.

2013
03:20:47,234 --> 03:20:52,377
[SPEAKER_24]: We heard a good group of kids come up and say, please do not eliminate our drama program.

2014
03:20:53,697 --> 03:20:56,619
[SPEAKER_24]: But yet, we're gonna do that because we have to save a couple of dollars.

2015
03:20:57,895 --> 03:21:06,243
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we really need to look at this budget before it's passed and make a decision that are we going to do that on the backs of our students, which are our kids.

2016
03:21:07,745 --> 03:21:08,085
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2017
03:21:08,185 --> 03:21:08,625
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2018
03:21:18,975 --> 03:21:20,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, my name is Tammy McLean.

2019
03:21:20,417 --> 03:21:22,118
[SPEAKER_10]: I live at 115 Sharon Street.

2020
03:21:24,044 --> 03:21:31,030
[SPEAKER_10]: And I didn't really plan anything because I was coming, believe it or not, to see if we could get some mics for the drama club.

2021
03:21:33,052 --> 03:21:35,634
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think I realized how bad the situation was.

2022
03:21:35,994 --> 03:21:37,315
[SPEAKER_10]: My daughter is in the ninth grade.

2023
03:21:37,355 --> 03:21:38,837
[SPEAKER_10]: She was in the high school musical.

2024
03:21:39,757 --> 03:21:50,387
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have to tell you, there's some little magic about theater and Medford, and there's just more kids coming up through the Saints at Spotlight to be a part of all of these programs.

2025
03:21:51,175 --> 03:21:59,882
[SPEAKER_10]: And I am just in disbelief at what these kids faced to pull off four performances of Mamma Mia, all of which I saw.

2026
03:22:01,613 --> 03:22:03,994
[SPEAKER_10]: They had inconsistent leadership.

2027
03:22:04,374 --> 03:22:07,535
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't have microphones until the day before the performance.

2028
03:22:07,555 --> 03:22:08,675
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't get to practice with them.

2029
03:22:08,695 --> 03:22:10,076
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they didn't have one for each kid.

2030
03:22:11,036 --> 03:22:13,477
[SPEAKER_10]: And clearly that is not the biggest problem that's here.

2031
03:22:14,077 --> 03:22:17,858
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I really wanted to just step up and say, this is your problem there.

2032
03:22:17,878 --> 03:22:20,399
[SPEAKER_10]: This is where you get the big bucks.

2033
03:22:20,779 --> 03:22:25,741
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to stop the bleeding now without cutting these programs and you need to raise our taxes.

2034
03:22:27,299 --> 03:22:34,387
[SPEAKER_10]: There are people here who want to pay their fair share to have better schools, and feel free to pave Sharon Street while you're at it.

2035
03:22:37,731 --> 03:22:44,919
[SPEAKER_10]: But really, there's people who want to, and you need to start working on the resistors now, so that when it hits the ballot, you have the support.

2036
03:22:44,979 --> 03:22:47,362
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's people who want to support that, so thank you.

2037
03:22:57,305 --> 03:22:59,167
[SPEAKER_19]: Chris Bennett, three minutes.

2038
03:22:59,728 --> 03:23:00,809
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record, please.

2039
03:23:03,072 --> 03:23:05,434
[SPEAKER_35]: Christine Bennett, 19 Martin Street in Medford.

2040
03:23:06,448 --> 03:23:12,612
[SPEAKER_35]: I've been a pro bono special education advocate within your system, and as well as other systems as well.

2041
03:23:13,752 --> 03:23:30,222
[SPEAKER_35]: And one of the things that I'm very concerned about is we're seeing an increase in the need for MCAS, and we're seeing increase in hearing that Medford is going to be fast pacing the mathematics department.

2042
03:23:32,123 --> 03:23:35,185
[SPEAKER_35]: And I'm dealing with a whole different litany of children.

2043
03:23:36,332 --> 03:23:40,035
[SPEAKER_35]: Some of those children are not academically sound.

2044
03:23:40,715 --> 03:23:42,316
[SPEAKER_35]: They're having a lot of difficulty.

2045
03:23:42,977 --> 03:23:49,801
[SPEAKER_35]: In one of the particular middle schools, we don't have a special education specific classroom for mathematics.

2046
03:23:51,402 --> 03:23:53,043
[SPEAKER_35]: So these kids are struggling.

2047
03:23:53,323 --> 03:24:05,852
[SPEAKER_35]: They're getting through because they're doing better presentations or getting extra, giving extra data to be able to get a higher grade so that they can feel good about themselves.

2048
03:24:06,812 --> 03:24:11,554
[SPEAKER_35]: And in the areas that I'm very concerned about are social-emotional learning.

2049
03:24:12,675 --> 03:24:17,356
[SPEAKER_35]: Since the pandemic, we have seen an increase in children not getting along.

2050
03:24:17,376 --> 03:24:20,898
[SPEAKER_35]: They have been not around each other often enough.

2051
03:24:21,718 --> 03:24:31,562
[SPEAKER_35]: And the guidance department and the nurses department, and I have to say secretaries are some of the major people that help these kids out.

2052
03:24:32,577 --> 03:24:33,938
[SPEAKER_35]: So see what we're dealing with.

2053
03:24:34,578 --> 03:24:45,122
[SPEAKER_35]: We've seen an increase in a stipend for, now it's considered a salary for all of the school committee people.

2054
03:24:45,842 --> 03:24:53,345
[SPEAKER_35]: We have seen an increase in the budgets in every other area.

2055
03:24:53,986 --> 03:24:57,667
[SPEAKER_35]: I wanna know how many assistant superintendents we have.

2056
03:24:58,768 --> 03:25:00,808
[SPEAKER_35]: I wanna know why the meat

2057
03:25:03,217 --> 03:25:09,162
[SPEAKER_35]: of the school is being cut when we have so many assistant superintendents.

2058
03:25:10,503 --> 03:25:16,648
[SPEAKER_35]: I think we're doing things backwards, as far as the prop two and a half, until we fix these issues.

2059
03:25:17,446 --> 03:25:24,908
[SPEAKER_35]: We're getting top heavy with administration and we're cutting the people that are necessary for the students specifically.

2060
03:25:25,508 --> 03:25:31,149
[SPEAKER_35]: Now, again, I said I am a pro bono advocate in the system that I've been working in.

2061
03:25:32,130 --> 03:25:34,210
[SPEAKER_35]: I've worked in all different school systems.

2062
03:25:35,070 --> 03:25:38,831
[SPEAKER_35]: And right now, what's going on here is extremely disappointing.

2063
03:25:39,731 --> 03:25:40,112
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2064
03:25:45,633 --> 03:25:45,813
[SPEAKER_34]: Mayor?

2065
03:25:47,279 --> 03:25:49,960
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Rousseau, then we have two more people online.

2066
03:25:50,401 --> 03:25:50,761
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

2067
03:25:51,121 --> 03:25:56,243
[SPEAKER_34]: In my seven years, I have heard that our administration is bloated 7,000 times probably.

2068
03:25:57,064 --> 03:25:59,825
[SPEAKER_34]: We have one superintendent and two assistant superintendents.

2069
03:26:00,525 --> 03:26:03,147
[SPEAKER_34]: There's not another 30 people hiding in the corners anywhere.

2070
03:26:04,642 --> 03:26:15,556
[SPEAKER_34]: And while sometimes there are districts that do have different levels of these folks, they are almost always staffed by adding countless other people at lower levels.

2071
03:26:15,576 --> 03:26:20,782
[SPEAKER_34]: You know, in many other school districts, every building has a

2072
03:26:21,443 --> 03:26:30,208
[SPEAKER_34]: grade level administrator, a grade level and disciplined level administrator, so a fifth grade science administrator.

2073
03:26:31,188 --> 03:26:33,830
[SPEAKER_34]: We have none of those people in this district, none.

2074
03:26:35,091 --> 03:26:48,598
[SPEAKER_34]: And so, I mean, everything that the speaker had to say, agree with almost everything, but the myth that we have this gigantic bloated administration, it's just a myth.

2075
03:26:50,399 --> 03:26:53,122
[SPEAKER_34]: We have one superintendent, we have to have a superintendent.

2076
03:26:53,502 --> 03:26:59,668
[SPEAKER_34]: We do have a director of people services, which is a legally mandated position for special ed and a few other things that she does.

2077
03:27:00,629 --> 03:27:05,433
[SPEAKER_34]: And then we have an administrator for all of academics for the whole district.

2078
03:27:05,994 --> 03:27:11,980
[SPEAKER_34]: And look around, nobody has one person responsible for academics K to 12, other than Medford.

2079
03:27:12,840 --> 03:27:15,243
[SPEAKER_34]: And then we have another administrator who is essentially doing

2080
03:27:15,865 --> 03:27:21,687
[SPEAKER_34]: operations, innovation, and I forget all of his titles, but so we are not bloated.

2081
03:27:21,967 --> 03:27:37,453
[SPEAKER_34]: And in fact, I can't really fathom how we could have less administration and this school committee and all the school committees that I've been on in the past so far, like we throw countless things at these folks to do far greater than they could actually

2082
03:27:37,873 --> 03:27:38,793
[SPEAKER_34]: get done, they do try.

2083
03:27:38,813 --> 03:27:54,519
[SPEAKER_34]: And so I just think it's important to point out that there is not this gigantic bloated administration, we have one administrative assistant covering all of them, even though there's, you know, positions that I think there's supposed to be three.

2084
03:27:55,828 --> 03:27:59,849
[SPEAKER_34]: there's one and they're covering all of those administrators and they're covering the school committee.

2085
03:27:59,910 --> 03:28:01,870
[SPEAKER_34]: And we of course also have a lot of asks.

2086
03:28:02,450 --> 03:28:12,434
[SPEAKER_34]: So I think it's just important to set the record straight on that because they're working like all the time and I can't imagine how we could have less.

2087
03:28:12,654 --> 03:28:12,974
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

2088
03:28:14,615 --> 03:28:15,535
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, member Russo.

2089
03:28:16,416 --> 03:28:18,877
[SPEAKER_20]: Sophie Ricks, name and address for the record, please.

2090
03:28:20,717 --> 03:28:22,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Sophie Ricks, 78 Cotting Street.

2091
03:28:24,989 --> 03:28:29,371
[SPEAKER_08]: I was not going to speak tonight because I already sent you a very long email earlier.

2092
03:28:29,391 --> 03:28:46,038
[SPEAKER_08]: But when I sent you the email at 9 10 this morning I was angry and now I'm just really furious so I feel like I want to read my email so that the superintendent can hear it as well and so that hopefully I can get a real response from you because I know I didn't get a real response when I wrote something very similar last year.

2093
03:28:47,382 --> 03:28:52,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm writing with my husband once again to urge you to please fund our public schools sufficiently.

2094
03:28:52,826 --> 03:28:56,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I am deeply alarmed by the significant budget cuts proposed this year.

2095
03:28:56,909 --> 03:28:58,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Our schools need more money, not less.

2096
03:28:59,791 --> 03:29:07,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year when I wrote to you urging you to fully fund our schools, I did not yet have a child in Medford Public Schools, but I had a good sense of the problem from neighbors and friends.

2097
03:29:08,437 --> 03:29:15,062
[SPEAKER_08]: After spending almost a full year now with a child in kindergarten at the Missituck, I'm sadly much more fully acquainted with how dire this need is.

2098
03:29:15,953 --> 03:29:25,521
[SPEAKER_08]: When my son's kindergarten teacher needed to be out unexpectedly for weeks due to a medical issue, the issue of no robust substitute pool came immediately to the forefront.

2099
03:29:25,821 --> 03:29:28,764
[SPEAKER_08]: No surprise given the absolutely dismal pay that we offer.

2100
03:29:29,464 --> 03:29:36,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Our principal and our assistant principal were both forced to step in for multiple days to teach kindergarten, pulling them away from their other critical roles.

2101
03:29:37,151 --> 03:29:39,172
[SPEAKER_08]: They did an amazing job, but this is absurd.

2102
03:29:39,793 --> 03:29:44,737
[SPEAKER_08]: After that, a number of specials teachers were tasked with helping, pulling them from the classes they were hired to teach.

2103
03:29:45,518 --> 03:29:49,668
[SPEAKER_08]: On multiple occasions, it seems our exceptional paraprofessional was running the class solo.

2104
03:29:50,490 --> 03:29:53,176
[SPEAKER_08]: This substitute job is really a volunteer position.

2105
03:29:54,034 --> 03:29:57,936
[SPEAKER_08]: One wonderful local mom was able to step in for a few days, but it was far from enough.

2106
03:29:58,616 --> 03:30:02,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Most importantly, kids across the entire school suffered from this, not just our classroom.

2107
03:30:03,678 --> 03:30:09,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Our classroom also desperately needed additional help this year due to multiple students with significant behavioral challenges.

2108
03:30:09,440 --> 03:30:12,121
[SPEAKER_08]: No such help was available because we don't have sufficient aids.

2109
03:30:12,882 --> 03:30:16,383
[SPEAKER_08]: These students deserve to receive the individual support they need to be successful.

2110
03:30:16,423 --> 03:30:17,264
[SPEAKER_08]: They're five-year-olds.

2111
03:30:17,984 --> 03:30:23,026
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not receive an adequate response to my email last year, so I'm pasting more in from what I shared last year.

2112
03:30:23,840 --> 03:30:31,982
[SPEAKER_08]: While our neighboring communities are prioritizing paying their teachers wages that reflect their hard work, our schools are struggling to retain staff and recruit new ones.

2113
03:30:32,202 --> 03:30:39,143
[SPEAKER_08]: As you know, our buildings and grounds are in disrepair and teachers are having to fund huge amounts of classroom supplies out of their own pockets.

2114
03:30:39,783 --> 03:30:47,625
[SPEAKER_08]: We were particularly disturbed and frankly depressed to read the full climate report regarding Medford High School last year and the challenges that go far beyond the aging building.

2115
03:30:48,277 --> 03:30:56,960
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can't even adequately fund our current needs, how can we possibly fund the necessities mentioned in the report, like hiring full-time substitutes to take the burden off classroom teachers?

2116
03:30:57,440 --> 03:31:00,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Will it feel safe to send our kids to Medford High when the time comes?

2117
03:31:00,781 --> 03:31:05,383
[SPEAKER_08]: We have not yet heard a plan from your office about addressing the challenges and solutions proposed in the report.

2118
03:31:06,103 --> 03:31:10,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also really concerned about what Member Russo was sharing earlier about the health curriculum.

2119
03:31:11,291 --> 03:31:13,672
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a priority for me as a clinical social worker.

2120
03:31:13,812 --> 03:31:20,154
[SPEAKER_08]: I work with college students and I see what the impact is when there are not sufficient mental health supports as a child.

2121
03:31:20,975 --> 03:31:37,361
[SPEAKER_08]: I am asking like others that you fund or that you push forward for an override, that you put that for the voters as soon as possible and that you use whatever means necessary right now to fully fund the schools to not have this $6 million deficit that really is a $6 million deficit,

2122
03:31:38,691 --> 03:31:41,573
[SPEAKER_08]: 2.7.

2123
03:31:39,212 --> 03:31:41,573
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really, really angry and I hope you're listening.

2124
03:31:44,635 --> 03:31:45,015
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Ms.

2125
03:31:45,075 --> 03:31:48,617
[SPEAKER_21]: Ricks.

2126
03:31:48,777 --> 03:31:50,779
[SPEAKER_21]: Christina Marie, may I have an address for the record, please?

2127
03:32:07,117 --> 03:32:09,058
[SPEAKER_21]: Angela, Angela, name and address for the record.

2128
03:32:11,280 --> 03:32:13,722
[SPEAKER_26]: Angela Sasso, 8 Madison Street.

2129
03:32:17,745 --> 03:32:24,810
[SPEAKER_26]: I, as you all know, I'm on the school committee and super in the superintendent.

2130
03:32:24,890 --> 03:32:33,636
[SPEAKER_26]: I am a former employee of the Medford Public School System and former president of the Administrative Assistance Union.

2131
03:32:34,978 --> 03:32:49,402
[SPEAKER_26]: I wrote in to the school committee and I was told that the budget cuts that are being done were proposed by the superintendent and the administration.

2132
03:32:49,422 --> 03:32:51,262
[SPEAKER_26]: I have a question.

2133
03:32:51,523 --> 03:32:52,683
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, a couple of questions.

2134
03:32:53,834 --> 03:33:02,461
[SPEAKER_26]: The McGlynn administrative assistant, that is the position that is being recommended to be cut.

2135
03:33:02,881 --> 03:33:06,884
[SPEAKER_26]: What is the data that goes along with that decision?

2136
03:33:07,224 --> 03:33:12,008
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we know how many students are dismissed daily from that school?

2137
03:33:12,468 --> 03:33:14,430
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we know how many phone calls come in?

2138
03:33:14,850 --> 03:33:16,872
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we know how many quarries are done?

2139
03:33:17,292 --> 03:33:20,575
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we know how many children are returned on the bus daily?

2140
03:33:20,875 --> 03:33:23,677
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we know how many parents are late picking up their children?

2141
03:33:26,358 --> 03:33:30,119
[SPEAKER_26]: So there's that to take into consideration.

2142
03:33:30,139 --> 03:33:49,583
[SPEAKER_26]: And as far as the position being cut in payroll, I don't know how you can bring in a management position to cover human resources and payroll when that is the administrative assistance union work.

2143
03:33:50,330 --> 03:33:51,391
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm no longer there.

2144
03:33:51,731 --> 03:33:58,754
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sure that the union president and the ask me rep will be in touch with you about that.

2145
03:33:58,794 --> 03:34:04,257
[SPEAKER_26]: But I'm just a bit confused where we're making these cuts and then we're gonna add a management position.

2146
03:34:05,718 --> 03:34:06,218
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2147
03:34:08,859 --> 03:34:09,300
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Ms.

2148
03:34:09,320 --> 03:34:09,720
[SPEAKER_20]: Sasso.

2149
03:34:11,921 --> 03:34:12,902
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not sure about the data.

2150
03:34:20,179 --> 03:34:21,180
[SPEAKER_21]: Christina Marie.

2151
03:34:28,766 --> 03:34:31,008
[SPEAKER_21]: We're asking her to unmute, I'm assuming Dr. Cushing.

2152
03:34:31,108 --> 03:34:32,850
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so probably not paying attention.

2153
03:34:32,890 --> 03:34:36,353
[SPEAKER_20]: So Ashley Daugherty, name and address of the record, Ashley.

2154
03:34:36,373 --> 03:34:39,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, my name is Ashley Daugherty.

2155
03:34:40,316 --> 03:34:43,199
[SPEAKER_13]: My address is 20 Watertown Street, Watertown MA.

2156
03:34:45,619 --> 03:34:48,100
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm one of the newer nurses at Medford Public Schools.

2157
03:34:48,160 --> 03:34:50,441
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been here for about two and a half, two years.

2158
03:34:52,142 --> 03:34:53,682
[SPEAKER_13]: And my position, can you hear me?

2159
03:34:56,784 --> 03:34:57,784
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, we can hear you, yes.

2160
03:34:58,164 --> 03:34:58,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

2161
03:34:59,145 --> 03:35:02,046
[SPEAKER_13]: My position is one of the positions that's proposed to be cut.

2162
03:35:02,066 --> 03:35:06,968
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just wanna speak factually on some of today's data so that you guys have it.

2163
03:35:08,048 --> 03:35:10,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Today at Andrews Middle School, we saw about 69 students

2164
03:35:13,430 --> 03:35:16,791
[SPEAKER_13]: in about six hours and 15 minutes of the school day.

2165
03:35:16,811 --> 03:35:19,632
[SPEAKER_13]: That's one student to every five and a half minutes.

2166
03:35:20,712 --> 03:35:26,213
[SPEAKER_13]: And not one of those visits do I think had higher priority than any of the 70 visits that we saw today.

2167
03:35:27,253 --> 03:35:32,414
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess my question is how is one nurse going to be capable of seeing 70 students a day?

2168
03:35:32,434 --> 03:35:40,716
[SPEAKER_13]: And at what point are you guys going to put a triage system in place that says one student has more priority to be seen than another student?

2169
03:35:41,923 --> 03:35:43,124
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's all, thank you.

2170
03:35:46,385 --> 03:35:47,025
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Ashley.

2171
03:35:49,006 --> 03:35:50,847
[SPEAKER_20]: One last time, Christina Marie.

2172
03:35:50,867 --> 03:35:59,050
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I'm gonna open it up to the floor.

2173
03:36:00,231 --> 03:36:02,031
[SPEAKER_20]: I know we probably need some time to digest this.

2174
03:36:03,352 --> 03:36:06,633
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, come on up.

2175
03:36:06,813 --> 03:36:08,194
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep, our student reps, sure.

2176
03:36:16,468 --> 03:36:28,614
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I'd like to point out, I don't know if it will seem tangential to what we're talking about here, but I know someone came up and mentioned something about the school committee visiting schools.

2177
03:36:28,654 --> 03:36:28,935
[SPEAKER_01]: I know for

2178
03:36:34,308 --> 03:36:39,995
[SPEAKER_01]: legal standards, school committee needs to be, school committee members need to be invited to schools.

2179
03:36:40,495 --> 03:36:49,986
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want to point out, I'm not sure where else in Medford it is the case, but I know at least at Medford High School it is, it does have an open door policy for all school committee members.

2180
03:36:51,467 --> 03:36:52,809
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I'm aware from

2181
03:36:55,384 --> 03:37:01,767
[SPEAKER_36]: from speaking with teachers, they've told us that it is an open-door policy, and we've also been working with Ms.

2182
03:37:01,827 --> 03:37:10,711
[SPEAKER_36]: Cabral to get in the new handbook provisions to explicitly state that Medford High School is an open-door policy to allow for school committee members to visit the high school.

2183
03:37:10,751 --> 03:37:11,591
[SPEAKER_20]: Great, great.

2184
03:37:11,611 --> 03:37:12,151
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much.

2185
03:37:12,692 --> 03:37:13,172
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

2186
03:37:13,272 --> 03:37:13,532
[SPEAKER_34]: Mayor?

2187
03:37:13,872 --> 03:37:14,632
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Russell?

2188
03:37:15,273 --> 03:37:20,155
[SPEAKER_34]: I would certainly welcome that in the handbook, but the law is actually not very unclear on this matter.

2189
03:37:22,273 --> 03:37:25,595
[SPEAKER_34]: I would not want school committee members to have the open door policy.

2190
03:37:26,215 --> 03:37:27,836
[SPEAKER_34]: The group here right now is great.

2191
03:37:28,277 --> 03:37:34,240
[SPEAKER_34]: We wanna go on and look at some school committees around the state where you're like, that person should not be showing up in students' classrooms.

2192
03:37:35,341 --> 03:37:43,986
[SPEAKER_34]: That's why it's the law, is that when everybody's great and we'd be fine to have them in our class, we're all fine with it.

2193
03:37:44,366 --> 03:37:49,810
[SPEAKER_34]: But really a key part of the First Amendment is it's the same for everybody.

2194
03:37:51,127 --> 03:38:01,289
[SPEAKER_34]: So when somebody's on the school committee who's disruptive to teachers' classrooms, if that is just allowed, then guess what?

2195
03:38:01,309 --> 03:38:06,250
[SPEAKER_34]: They're gonna show up in your classroom, they're gonna disagree with the way you're teaching a subject or the content you're teaching.

2196
03:38:06,870 --> 03:38:14,732
[SPEAKER_34]: I think that that is not, when we think about inviting school committee members into the class, we think of the good things that are gonna happen.

2197
03:38:15,252 --> 03:38:20,093
[SPEAKER_34]: And I do agree completely that there are lots of good things that will happen, but it is,

2198
03:38:20,711 --> 03:38:23,733
[SPEAKER_34]: You know, at this moment in time I don't have a full time job.

2199
03:38:24,034 --> 03:38:26,416
[SPEAKER_34]: How many hours a day do you want me sitting through your classes.

2200
03:38:27,096 --> 03:38:38,385
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't think most teachers want to have me sitting in their classes for, you know, maybe I'm just curious how you teach or, you know, anything you can think of.

2201
03:38:41,618 --> 03:39:04,999
[SPEAKER_34]: the superintendent must invite us, and most superintendents, I think, delegate that to lower other people within the district to be allowed that, but an explicit invitation like we did get last week, or was it this week for the, I don't even know, it's Monday, last week for the social studies presentations at the high school, we did get an explicit invitation, a couple of us were able to go,

2202
03:39:06,075 --> 03:39:13,141
[SPEAKER_34]: And that was great, but I think that having us just show up when I have spot in my calendar, walking around the school.

2203
03:39:13,161 --> 03:39:16,103
[SPEAKER_34]: I think that is not what educators want.

2204
03:39:16,583 --> 03:39:21,827
[SPEAKER_34]: And I also don't really think that's what students want like who is this this guy just roaming around.

2205
03:39:24,926 --> 03:39:53,054
[SPEAKER_34]: but I completely understand the intent, and I think if we can codify some way to make it more of an open door, like here's our intent, and then here's the process school committee members must follow, which would definitely have to include permission, because when we show up at a building, we are no different than anybody else in the entire public of the world, frankly, and have no more rights to be in that building, even if our own kids are in that building.

2206
03:39:53,155 --> 03:39:54,555
[SPEAKER_34]: If you are not there to see your kids,

2207
03:39:54,926 --> 03:39:56,687
[SPEAKER_34]: You do not have a right to be in that building.

2208
03:39:57,948 --> 03:40:02,332
[SPEAKER_34]: And I don't think that we can put it in the handbook.

2209
03:40:02,392 --> 03:40:04,974
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't think we can draft a policy that overrides that.

2210
03:40:05,354 --> 03:40:11,979
[SPEAKER_34]: I think we could perhaps come to something that would lay the path for how we could do it the right way.

2211
03:40:12,987 --> 03:40:17,150
[SPEAKER_34]: and make that really open and obvious that like, you wanna go, here's what you gotta do.

2212
03:40:17,170 --> 03:40:20,153
[SPEAKER_34]: Email this person, get an actual invite.

2213
03:40:21,233 --> 03:40:25,397
[SPEAKER_34]: But I just think that's an important thing for us to talk about.

2214
03:40:25,437 --> 03:40:30,961
[SPEAKER_34]: And we can talk about it at the Student Advisory Council, because I do think it's important for us to get into the class.

2215
03:40:33,403 --> 03:40:33,703
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

2216
03:40:36,545 --> 03:40:37,326
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Member Russo.

2217
03:40:40,362 --> 03:40:57,599
[SPEAKER_36]: I just wonder if I could present a letter on behalf of the Student Advisory Committee drafted to the school board.

2218
03:40:58,925 --> 03:41:14,039
[SPEAKER_36]: On behalf of the students of Mefford High School, we the students of the Student Advisory Committee, expressing a consensus opinion of the committee for the school year of 2023 to 2024, are writing this letter to express our opinion on the planned budget cuts to the Mefford Public Schools positions and budget.

2219
03:41:14,939 --> 03:41:19,443
[SPEAKER_36]: The Mefford Student Advisory Committee acknowledges that the city of Mefford is presently experiencing a budget deficit.

2220
03:41:19,684 --> 03:41:23,367
[SPEAKER_36]: This deficit has put a great strain on city services provided to the citizens of Mefford.

2221
03:41:23,755 --> 03:41:28,420
[SPEAKER_36]: One place where these budget constraints are already felt is in the Medford Public School Districts.

2222
03:41:29,000 --> 03:41:44,837
[SPEAKER_36]: Some of the major issues the Student Advisory Committee would like to highlight to the Medford School Committee include the lack of running water in the teacher's break room, a lack of heating and cooling in classrooms during the summer and winter respectively, as well as asbestos remaining inside of the facilities in Medford High School.

2223
03:41:45,953 --> 03:41:51,715
[SPEAKER_36]: The school committee has proposed the budget cuts to the 2024-2025 school year budget of the Medford Public School Districts.

2224
03:41:52,015 --> 03:41:59,398
[SPEAKER_36]: These cuts, if carried out, will have an immediate and long-term detrimental effects on the quality of educations for the students in the Medford Public School District.

2225
03:42:00,498 --> 03:42:14,643
[SPEAKER_36]: As a result of these budget cuts proposed in the fine arts positions, as well as numerous other positions, student activities that are essential to the school and culture of Medford High School, as well as the community of Medford as a whole, will be put at risk.

2226
03:42:15,794 --> 03:42:23,796
[SPEAKER_36]: Furthermore, this will lead to a drop in education quality and opportunities for students, which could lead to a decrease in the number of students attending Mefford Public Schools.

2227
03:42:24,396 --> 03:42:32,098
[SPEAKER_36]: Furthermore, these proposed cuts will raise the workload of Mefford Public Schools faculties, further increasing the already large burden on Mefford Public School faculty members.

2228
03:42:34,279 --> 03:42:45,542
[SPEAKER_36]: Additionally, the proposed 2025 proposal would increase the average class size across the board from nearly 20 pupils per class, with McGlynn and Missitook pushing a proposed average of 22 students per class.

2229
03:42:46,018 --> 03:42:50,621
[SPEAKER_36]: The Student Advisory Committee believes that when it comes to student education, there should be no compromises.

2230
03:42:51,022 --> 03:42:54,484
[SPEAKER_36]: Students deserve the right to receive the highest quality of education possible.

2231
03:42:54,964 --> 03:43:07,353
[SPEAKER_36]: While the deficit does pose a considerable concern, the Student Advisory Committee would also like to point out that these proposed cuts are affecting teachers and lower echelon administrative staff who do most of the day-to-day paperwork and operations.

2232
03:43:08,534 --> 03:43:11,516
[SPEAKER_36]: While the School Committee does not have the authority to make the budget,

2233
03:43:11,957 --> 03:43:17,379
[SPEAKER_36]: They can request that the City Council propose a new budget to account for the needs of students and teachers in the Medford Public School District.

2234
03:43:17,819 --> 03:43:23,322
[SPEAKER_36]: Students deserve a quality environment with well-paid teachers and faculty and a safe, operable facility.

2235
03:43:23,662 --> 03:43:26,443
[SPEAKER_36]: And before I end off, I would just like to add a personal opinion.

2236
03:43:27,290 --> 03:43:44,288
[SPEAKER_36]: As a lifelong student of Medford Public Schools, a student representative for the Student Advisory Committee, as well as a student government official, and someone who has performed in the fine arts, I can say without doubt that these cuts will result in an immediate and long-term, long-lasting negative impact for students for generations to come if these cuts are made.

2237
03:43:45,590 --> 03:43:45,830
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

2238
03:43:54,795 --> 03:43:55,055
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor.

2239
03:43:55,576 --> 03:43:56,036
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham.

2240
03:43:56,476 --> 03:44:03,022
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to reiterate what, how our process normally works, just so that everybody understands like where we go from here.

2241
03:44:04,723 --> 03:44:06,825
[SPEAKER_17]: So we, this is a public budget hearing.

2242
03:44:06,905 --> 03:44:08,006
[SPEAKER_17]: It's required by law.

2243
03:44:08,046 --> 03:44:10,207
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why we were here to listen to all of you.

2244
03:44:10,748 --> 03:44:18,854
[SPEAKER_17]: The administration made a proposal to us with the direction that they've received so far, which is this is going to be a bad budget year.

2245
03:44:19,315 --> 03:44:22,938
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to figure out how to ramp off of ESSER because it's over, right?

2246
03:44:22,978 --> 03:44:24,499
[SPEAKER_17]: So they, that's the sort of

2247
03:44:25,444 --> 03:44:27,505
[SPEAKER_17]: genesis of what they brought forward tonight.

2248
03:44:27,525 --> 03:44:35,549
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think anybody here wants to vote for this because I think we all know how catastrophic these changes are.

2249
03:44:36,389 --> 03:44:39,470
[SPEAKER_17]: What we will do is a two-part process.

2250
03:44:39,510 --> 03:44:45,953
[SPEAKER_17]: So the first thing we will do is ultimately agree on what our request to the municipal government is.

2251
03:44:46,454 --> 03:44:51,276
[SPEAKER_17]: So that number could be a number that you saw tonight and it could be something else entirely.

2252
03:44:51,926 --> 03:44:54,347
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, we have work to do before we're going to get there.

2253
03:44:54,907 --> 03:44:56,608
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's step one is our ask.

2254
03:44:57,789 --> 03:45:10,795
[SPEAKER_17]: Once the mayor's budget comes out, once the city council holds all of their hearings, once that budget is approved, then we will take whatever number is approved and we will have to reconcile to that number.

2255
03:45:10,855 --> 03:45:14,717
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's two steps in our process that is new in the last like three years.

2256
03:45:15,377 --> 03:45:20,219
[SPEAKER_17]: It's important because before three years ago, we never asked for one penny more than the city was willing to give.

2257
03:45:21,000 --> 03:45:21,120
[SPEAKER_17]: And

2258
03:45:21,741 --> 03:45:25,226
[SPEAKER_17]: That has set a trajectory that puts us all here tonight.

2259
03:45:25,346 --> 03:45:32,996
[SPEAKER_17]: So the point of this two step process is for us always to be talking about what we think we need to responsibly run our schools.

2260
03:45:33,617 --> 03:45:39,945
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this year, it's obviously much more complicated because we sort of know what we're walking into and how

2261
03:45:40,885 --> 03:45:42,907
[SPEAKER_17]: devastating it is to come off of ESSER.

2262
03:45:42,947 --> 03:45:45,129
[SPEAKER_17]: There's 30 positions funded last year.

2263
03:45:45,650 --> 03:45:48,893
[SPEAKER_17]: We knew that this was coming, and we knew that this would be hard.

2264
03:45:49,254 --> 03:45:52,837
[SPEAKER_17]: How hard it is still is an open question that we have to answer.

2265
03:45:52,917 --> 03:45:55,160
[SPEAKER_17]: But I just wanted to make sure everyone knew what was happening.

2266
03:45:55,220 --> 03:45:57,042
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're taking this all in.

2267
03:45:57,082 --> 03:46:04,169
[SPEAKER_17]: The administration's going to think about this, figure out how they bring forward updates to the budget based on what we heard.

2268
03:46:04,709 --> 03:46:10,972
[SPEAKER_17]: the mayor's working, the finance task force is working, there's a lot still to do, but we will take two votes.

2269
03:46:11,212 --> 03:46:16,234
[SPEAKER_17]: One is our request, and then the other will be how do we get to the number that we have to live with.

2270
03:46:17,254 --> 03:46:25,818
[SPEAKER_17]: And I hope that number is not 73.5, because we did not see tonight the path that gets us to that number.

2271
03:46:26,178 --> 03:46:28,959
[SPEAKER_17]: We saw a path that gets us to something, $2.7 million more than that.

2272
03:46:31,547 --> 03:46:33,308
[SPEAKER_17]: There's still a lot of work to do.

2273
03:46:34,268 --> 03:46:41,112
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not an easy process, but I just, I don't want people to think anybody here on this school committee thinks this is fine.

2274
03:46:41,592 --> 03:46:42,673
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think that's true.

2275
03:46:43,834 --> 03:46:44,954
[SPEAKER_17]: None of us want to do this.

2276
03:46:45,354 --> 03:46:49,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Unfortunately, at some point we will be the ones to have to make these reconciliations.

2277
03:46:49,737 --> 03:46:56,260
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just hope we can make a few less, least bad choices than it looks like we will have to make as of tonight.

2278
03:46:56,660 --> 03:46:56,961
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2279
03:46:57,321 --> 03:46:58,101
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, member Graham.

2280
03:46:58,201 --> 03:46:58,762
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Russo?

2281
03:46:59,322 --> 03:46:59,782
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes, thank you.

2282
03:46:59,922 --> 03:47:01,103
[SPEAKER_34]: And you know,

2283
03:47:02,064 --> 03:47:03,965
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't believe it was last year, I believe it was the year before.

2284
03:47:05,326 --> 03:47:15,072
[SPEAKER_34]: There's this sort of question in Massachusetts law about, well, it's settled for city councils.

2285
03:47:15,212 --> 03:47:23,877
[SPEAKER_34]: If the city council just refuses to pass the budget, I believe it's 45 days later, whatever the budget was that the city administration presented.

2286
03:47:23,897 --> 03:47:24,297
[SPEAKER_34]: Sorry, how many?

2287
03:47:24,397 --> 03:47:25,258
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, go ahead, sorry.

2288
03:47:25,418 --> 03:47:25,798
[SPEAKER_20]: Explain it in 112.

2289
03:47:25,858 --> 03:47:25,938
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2290
03:47:27,857 --> 03:47:32,099
[SPEAKER_34]: just becomes the budget without the vote of the city council after a certain number of days.

2291
03:47:33,560 --> 03:47:35,461
[SPEAKER_34]: And, well, that's the city council.

2292
03:47:36,182 --> 03:47:45,447
[SPEAKER_34]: And I have asked our professional association, which has every school committee member in the state, and frankly, people who have probably been on school committees as long as I've been alive.

2293
03:47:46,948 --> 03:47:52,210
[SPEAKER_34]: And, you know, our previous finance director was an attorney and like, you know, we,

2294
03:47:54,136 --> 03:47:58,336
[SPEAKER_34]: It does appear to be an outstanding question if we just refuse to pass the budget, what happens?

2295
03:47:59,469 --> 03:48:05,871
[SPEAKER_34]: One option, one opinion is that on July 1st, without a budget, the district stops operating.

2296
03:48:05,891 --> 03:48:07,512
[SPEAKER_34]: Of course, school's not in session.

2297
03:48:08,112 --> 03:48:15,054
[SPEAKER_34]: And we have funds that are like, you know, not leftover, set aside funds for like special ed.

2298
03:48:15,454 --> 03:48:18,535
[SPEAKER_34]: There's a few places where we're allowed to save money for special eds.

2299
03:48:18,735 --> 03:48:20,496
[SPEAKER_34]: One, I believe there's a transportation one.

2300
03:48:20,516 --> 03:48:24,017
[SPEAKER_34]: But anyways, like we could technically operate off of those funds.

2301
03:48:24,578 --> 03:48:30,894
[SPEAKER_34]: for some period of time, which of course does assume that we're a week away or a month away from finally agreeing on a budget.

2302
03:48:31,275 --> 03:48:33,040
[SPEAKER_34]: But the other opinion is that

2303
03:48:36,092 --> 03:48:38,154
[SPEAKER_34]: It just becomes the budget even if we didn't vote for it.

2304
03:48:39,095 --> 03:48:50,504
[SPEAKER_34]: It seems like no school committee, and it makes sense when you think about school committees and if you've, y'all haven't been to our associations, but it's a group of people, nobody runs for school committee because it's a good time.

2305
03:48:51,425 --> 03:48:53,146
[SPEAKER_34]: We run for school committee because we care about kids.

2306
03:48:53,566 --> 03:48:57,610
[SPEAKER_34]: And so for us to decide that we'd rather shut the district down,

2307
03:49:00,439 --> 03:49:04,183
[SPEAKER_34]: rather than take a horrible budget that at least is still operating.

2308
03:49:05,284 --> 03:49:09,528
[SPEAKER_34]: It does appear that no school committee has ever just said, we're just not going to pass a budget.

2309
03:49:10,769 --> 03:49:19,919
[SPEAKER_34]: So, you know, it's it's it's settled for what happens with the city council 45 days or whatever the number of days later it just becomes the budget whether they voted for it or not.

2310
03:49:20,799 --> 03:49:22,980
[SPEAKER_34]: But for school committees, that is an outstanding question.

2311
03:49:23,160 --> 03:49:33,204
[SPEAKER_34]: And I'd like Medford to not be the first community to ever have to sit, go to a judge and find out what the right answer is by getting us enough money.

2312
03:49:34,445 --> 03:49:46,150
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm not necessarily saying I'm, if we have to cut another 2.7 million and after the administration comes back and says, well, this is what that is, you know,

2313
03:49:47,045 --> 03:49:54,449
[SPEAKER_34]: Maybe we will be here and refuse to vote for our budget and get to find out for the first time what happens in Massachusetts when a school committee refuses.

2314
03:49:55,109 --> 03:50:04,675
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, 2.7 million more than the horrible stuff we've discussed tonight is a number where I'd be like, fine, we won't have school until this is settled.

2315
03:50:05,635 --> 03:50:09,157
[SPEAKER_34]: Because what is school if you've chopped this much?

2316
03:50:11,431 --> 03:50:12,291
[SPEAKER_34]: I hope we won't get there.

2317
03:50:12,311 --> 03:50:18,213
[SPEAKER_34]: And my understanding of the courts is we'll probably just lose and we'll just say it just becomes the budget is my guess.

2318
03:50:18,253 --> 03:50:31,477
[SPEAKER_34]: But it is an outstanding question and one that I think about a lot when I think about what it would mean to vote for a budget that chopped six, seven, whatever the number is, millions of dollars total.

2319
03:50:32,317 --> 03:50:33,498
[SPEAKER_34]: So thank you.

2320
03:50:34,718 --> 03:50:35,058
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2321
03:50:35,318 --> 03:50:35,838
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you all.

2322
03:50:35,878 --> 03:50:36,298
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2323
03:50:36,318 --> 03:50:37,819
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you everybody who came and spoke.

2324
03:50:38,726 --> 03:50:40,809
[SPEAKER_20]: some more work to do and digesting to do.

2325
03:50:41,209 --> 03:50:45,014
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to move forward to the regular scheduled meeting agenda.

2326
03:50:45,034 --> 03:50:51,602
[SPEAKER_20]: A motion to adjourn this meeting by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Graham.

2327
03:50:51,943 --> 03:50:52,744
[SPEAKER_20]: All those in favor?

2328
03:50:52,764 --> 03:50:53,645
[SPEAKER_20]: Aye.

2329
03:50:53,665 --> 03:50:54,626
[SPEAKER_20]: All those opposed?

2330
03:50:55,667 --> 03:50:57,049
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, that meeting's adjourned.
