1
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:50,179
do do

2
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:23,780
Hey Terry, you know why Jews have long arms and short necks? No, I don't. See, see, that's just stupid.

3
00:04:27,398 --> 00:04:48,848
Good evening, friends and neighbors. My name is Terry E. Cotter, and I direct elder services at our beloved West Medford Community Center. Welcome to another live monthly presentation of First Friday's Words in Music, one of our official favorite events at WMCC. It's December.

4
00:04:48,848 --> 00:05:11,800
a traditional time of hope and faith and light for people all over the world. Despite the fact that it's a bit cold outside, we're warm and toasty in the building. Thanks to a generous grant from the Medford Arts Council, a member of the Massachusetts Cultural Council, we are ready to celebrate the season at 111 Arlington Street.

5
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:33,490
We are, of course, still trying to be mindful of local health requirements and concerns, so masking is welcomed but not required. On the whole this year, we've had many months of sponsoring live programming here at the WMCC and all over the city of Medford as well. Please be courteous to your neighbors as we move forward.

6
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:56,664
Through the evening, we are appreciating the media work put in by Kevin Harrington and Medford Community Media for guiding us as we broadcast to you via Medford Community Media channels 9 for Comcast and 47 for Verizon. If you're out there watching on your electronic devices, welcome to the show.

7
00:05:56,664 --> 00:06:12,961
So tonight's conversation is taking place as a true departure from what we usually do on First Fridays. So I'm going to introduce my partner in crime for the evening, the community center's own Eileen Lerner. Eileen?

8
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:41,647
Eileen is a relatively new WMCC board member, but she's no stranger to many who are here on a regular basis. She's been a Medford resident for many years, and an active and engaged member of the West Medford Senior Club. Eileen is also a longtime human rights activist, a journalist, and a former teacher. She speaks her mind, and tonight what we're gonna do is let her.

9
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:57,910
Eileen, what's on your mind this evening? No, I'm taking this one. What's on my mind is I'm the interviewer and you are the interviewee. So let's change chairs.

10
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:27,398
Okay, so, wow, this is so much fun. I get to ask Terry questions, you know.

11
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:52,927
and questions that I've always thought about. Okay, but first I have to read his biography. Okay. Terry E. Carter is a gifted writer, poet, and speaker who has been writing and developing his craft for decades. He is a classically trained poet with literary influences that range from Shakespeare to the Harlem Renaissance.

12
00:07:52,927 --> 00:08:17,159
Terry is a sought-after poet and presenter on a variety of topics related to black history, faith, and contemporary culture. He has published six volumes of poetry, including his newly completed book, Brown Skin and the Brilliant Sun, a poet's opus released

13
00:08:18,148 --> 00:08:41,237
in October. Terry E. Carter was named the inaugural Poet Laureate of Medford Mass in the summer of 2021 and completed his two-year term at the end of June. Terry is an ordained deacon and arts minister at Jubilee Christian Church of Stoughton. He directs elder services

14
00:08:41,374 --> 00:08:59,241
and special programs in the West Medford community, and is married to Teresa Carter, an ordained pastor and liturgical dance leader. So, well, I have my own, so you have yours, okay.

15
00:08:59,241 --> 00:09:15,964
So Terry, many of us know that you were introduced to poetry in Medford High School by a really excellent teacher. But I've always wondered, what was it about poetry rather than other forms of writing

16
00:09:15,964 --> 00:09:45,009
For example, fiction, nonfiction, journalism. What was it about poetry that grabbed you and made it become your genre of choice? That's a really good question. Well, as you mentioned, I was indeed introduced to poetry at Medford High School, freshman or sophomore year. I had an English teacher by the name of Eleanor Kookavidis, beautiful Greek lady.

17
00:09:45,009 --> 00:10:12,637
And she gave me a little volume of Langston Hughes's poetry, and I was off and running. Now, I always liked to read. Growing up as a kid, I was a comic book reader, had a big collection of comic books. So there definitely were other genres of writing that I was interested in. And I had kind of started writing some little short stories and things of my own.

18
00:10:12,637 --> 00:10:29,104
But when the poetry bug grabbed me, I was kind of grabbed for good. I've had to learn how to write for professional life, and I've written all kinds of things. And then when I went to graduate school at BU,

19
00:10:29,104 --> 00:10:53,200
obviously the writing came back into play because Mass Comm, one of the tracks was broadcast journalism. And I was in that track, so I had to refine my writing for the news media, et cetera, and so forth. But I didn't go down that road professionally. But writing has always been something that has

20
00:10:55,213 --> 00:11:24,582
stood me in good stead, I would say, in my professional life. But the poetry is the thing that really, really kind of lights my fire, so to speak. Yes, I hear you. Yeah. OK. What was the subject of the very first poem you ever wrote? Wow. And listen, you know, everybody's got a roses are red, violets are blue poem in them somewhere. So I have to assume that I probably wrote some little ditties when I was trying to get up.

21
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:48,456
No, well, you know, I tried to unremember a lot of stuff that would get me in trouble with my current relationships. Oh, OK. So if I wrote another poem, if I wrote a poem to another woman earlier in my life, I'm trying not to remember that. I hear you. I don't want to throw that up in my wife's face. That was a wise choice. Yeah. But the first serious poem, serious poems I'll say,

22
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:58,302
I wrote this really scathing indictment of, and this is pre-hip-hop, pre-rap, of

23
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:27,432
Watergate. And I remember the first couple lines were, listen, my children, and you shall hear of the Watergate big political smear. And then it went on and on and on. So Nixon and Haldeman and Ehrlichman and Dean. And you rhymed all those? Yeah, I rhymed all those. Yeah. In the White House mystery mischief machine, I'm sure that was a piece of it.

24
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:49,701
So that was pretty serious, but the one that I remember best was a poem called All My Heroes are Black Men. And I wrote that as a paean to growing up and then finally discovering the richness of black history. And I wrote about all of it.

25
00:12:49,701 --> 00:13:02,295
in that poem. And that was one of the poems that was kind of the framework for my first book, Brown Skin and the Bread of Life, A Poet's Journey. How old were you at that time?

26
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:26,408
I wrote that poem years and years and years before I actually published the book, so I have to, I think I was probably about 18, 19. Yeah, I think I was in college when I wrote that. Wow. Yeah. And when did you publish your very first book? That's a good, it's another good question. It's an interesting story because

27
00:13:28,114 --> 00:13:47,142
I was... 2009, I was working for a career development organization for high-talent students of color called En-ROADS, a national organization. And what we did is we would recruit the students, go to the different schools and grab the students,

28
00:13:47,142 --> 00:14:09,155
And then we would put them through a training regimen, you know, and teaching them everything from professional etiquette to dressing for business, all of that. And part and parcel to that was finding them really high-grade internships in Fortune 500 companies. And I had a portfolio of companies. I had Bleach, I had...

29
00:14:09,155 --> 00:14:27,619
Liberty Mutual, MetLife, a lot of insurance firms, that was my silo. So I loved that job, I was at that job for almost 11 years and they had this big organizational shake-up

30
00:14:27,619 --> 00:14:55,435
and a lot of folks lost their jobs, and I was part of a lot of folks. So that year, there's an old saying that when God closes a door, he opens a window. Mama always said that. Yeah, absolutely. So what happened was I was trying to figure out how I was going to fill my time, and two things happened. I wrote my first book, I think I published in 2010, and then

31
00:14:57,534 --> 00:15:12,551
roughly around the same time, maybe a little bit after, I got invited to take the job as director of elder services here at the community center. And how did that come about? One of my good friends,

32
00:15:12,551 --> 00:15:37,210
Calvin Lindsey Jr. was actually the President of the Board of Directors at the time, and he said, you know, Terry, we just, we're gonna lose our Director of Elder Services for a couple different reasons. Why? You think it might be something you'd be interested in. I wasn't working. He said, it's just part-time, but, you know, you get to be in Medford more often, you get to hang out with your people.

33
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:55,981
Because I was in Randolph. My wife and I had relocated to Randolph. So I took the job. So, as someone who was born and bred in West Medford, what led you to move out of your beloved community and eventually leading you and your family to move to Randolph?

34
00:15:57,244 --> 00:16:12,483
We got priced out. I'm going to be perfectly plain with you. Well, there were two things, two mitigating factors. The first was my wife was actually working for a city department in Boston.

35
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:40,606
and she was six months away from being grandfathered when they pressed the residency requirement. So we had to go into Boston, or else she would have lost her job. But we moved into Boston, we got an apartment in Dorchester, nice, enjoyed it, but we were also thinking about buying, so we started looking a little bit, and we looked at Medford, and we couldn't touch Medford.

36
00:16:40,606 --> 00:16:59,787
It was just, you know, couldn't do it. Prohibitively expensive. Prohibitively expensive. And gotten more so every year. Yeah, so we stayed in Boston in two different apartments in Dorchester and then a stint of time with my mother-in-law as well.

37
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:18,729
for close to 16 years. And then we said this is crazy, especially because the area of Dorchester that we were in, this is the second apartment, had gotten pretty gamey. There was a lot of shootings, there was a lot of crazy stuff going on.

38
00:17:18,729 --> 00:17:37,534
In the street that we lived on, at the top of the street, there were a couple of brownstones. And there was all manner of scurrilous activity taking place in those brownstones. I mean, all kinds of activity. And the police were up and down the street all the time. So we just finally.

39
00:17:37,534 --> 00:18:01,698
We got war down, and we started looking again. We looked south, and Randolph ended up being the community that we settled on, and we were able to buy a really nice house in Randolph. It is pretty. My son used to live there. Was that right? Conrad lived there when his kids were young, so I'm familiar with Randolph. Yeah, yeah. So I'm curious about

40
00:18:01,698 --> 00:18:29,599
What are the messages that you want people to get from your poetry? What are you trying to communicate to people? I don't know if we got time for me to tell you all of it, but I'll definitely tell you some of it. So why don't we do it like this? Let me tell you a little bit about it, and then I'll just read a couple pieces. And that way, folks will get a bit of an idea. I think that's a good idea. OK. OK, good.

41
00:18:31,254 --> 00:18:51,493
I was very much faith-driven when I wrote my first book, Brown Skin and the Bread of Life, the bread of life being Jesus Christ, you know, biblically. But I was also driven by a desire to connect with history, you know, African American history in particular.

42
00:18:51,493 --> 00:19:10,657
I was driven by the influences of music in my life. I love jazz, so jazz is in there. I wanted to be able to write some things that I could then pass on generationally. And I've always considered myself a storyteller.

43
00:19:10,657 --> 00:19:34,104
So I wanted to be able to tell some stories as well. So I think those are the major influences. But coming back to West Medford and being here ended up being actually a bigger influence than many of those things. And I'll explain why when I read one of these pieces I'm going to read.

44
00:19:34,104 --> 00:19:54,514
So all of those things, all of those things. So let me read a piece, kind of get you, kind of answer your question even a little bit more. Okay. Okay, so as I said, Medford, West Medford in particular became a very big influence in my writing.

45
00:19:54,514 --> 00:20:24,428
particularly because of the creeping gentrification that was taking place when I came back to the neighborhood, and how difficult it was for folks like myself who wanted to come back to Medford to be able to find a place where they could. But I found my place here at the community center, so I'm not mad at anybody. But I wanna talk a little bit about some of the things that I've seen, especially over the last several years.

46
00:20:24,428 --> 00:20:45,077
So this piece is called Mystic River Melancholy. The freshly quaffed boho boys make real estate videos extolling the finer virtues of West Medford and life along the Mystic River. Maybe they're new money kids or Tufts grads. They don't know the rich history of the village.

47
00:20:45,077 --> 00:21:06,049
They do have a sense that this is a minor mecca for ex-city dwellers, flush with IPO cash, NFT windfalls, or Bitcoin early adoptions. A new gentry that wants to be landed for their dogs, and their Range Rovers, and their wine tastings, and the next generation of trust fund babies.

48
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:17,568
The would-be property princes have a target market. The YouTube appeal is slick and shiny. Classic Americana with a side of sushi or a venti mocha latte.

49
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:44,701
They have no idea of what used to be. They know what the next wave wants to see. They want to see the bikes, the hikes, and their kids on trikes. They want to post pics that get lots of likes. They want to see the flowering trees and the birds and the bees. Their high-rise havens had none of these. They want to see if they can grow something green in a backyard garden beyond the green that's growing in their bulging bank accounts.

50
00:21:45,094 --> 00:21:57,415
Designer overalls and Doc Martens do not a farmer make. No worries, Whole Foods has gone 100% organic with a great selection of finely curated herbs and spices.

51
00:21:58,592 --> 00:22:28,370
I know this sounds like resentment. Resignation frequently does. But when the private boat clubs bookend the public beach and the abutters don't want loud, unruly Dominicans descending on their hillsides for beachfront parking, well, what's a brother from the Ville to think? My daddy taught me how to fish here. Not much more than eels and sunfish in the water then, but it felt like legacy, and we were happy to have it.

52
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:43,746
They really didn't want us at their beach back then either, but we were mighty in our minority. We didn't want to fight folks, but the lake wasn't exactly pristine, so why begrudge it to anybody?

53
00:22:44,053 --> 00:23:09,599
We could walk that half mile or ride our stingray bikes down there and feel connected to the small waves in the gentle wake. We could wonder about the kayakers and the canoe paddlers, the colorful sunfishers, occasional scullers, and the ubiquitous motor boaters. We could dream a little dream about owning a dinghy and a trawling engine and maybe making a few waves of our own. Don't get me wrong.

54
00:23:09,906 --> 00:23:36,954
I love the new fish ladders and the intrepid herring counters, the trout infusion, the bald eagle sightings, and the focus on environmental sustainability. Thing is, they love it too, and they can pay for it. 1.4 mil for Queen Dorothy Elizabeth Tucker's old homestead. It should have been a historical landmark. Instead, it's yet another preview of coming attractions.

55
00:23:37,773 --> 00:24:05,299
Meanwhile, the sleepy little Nubian Hamlet has released its black and brown patina to the inexorable tug of real property values and the dying off of the old guard. Mine is the last generation that knew about the first three streets, Arlington, Lincoln, and Jerome, that knew about the little store, the old Shiloh Baptist, and the library in the fire station.

56
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:22,176
Mine is the last generation that knew about Charlie Booker and the Bruins, the five fighting Phillips brothers, Uncle Buddy's postal command, Doc Count's blue books, Faucina and Evelyn's beauty salon, and exactly why it's called Duggar Park.

57
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:45,981
So many firsts, so much history, so little time to savor and to save, to preserve and to pass on. So many departures, so few arrivals of the black and the brown and the tan. Meanwhile, the developers mostly have their way. The Spanish day laborers tear it down and build it back up.

58
00:24:46,152 --> 00:25:15,111
Like Lee Majors and the $6 million man, they have the technology. They can make them better than they were, better, stronger, faster. Condos and townhouses, Tony and Trendy, out with the old, in with the new, wash, rinse, and repeat. Meanwhile, the freshly quaffed boho boys make real estate videos, extolling the finer virtues of West Medford and life along the Mystic River.

59
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:49,138
Wow, Terry, that's powerful. I feel it, because I lived in West Cambridge for many years. And West Cambridge is undergoing the same change that West Medford is. And when I talk to my neighbors, they say, oh, Eileen, nobody's here anymore. And nobody's smiling and saying hello as people move in. So it's a loss. It's a big loss and a tragedy, really.

60
00:25:49,650 --> 00:26:19,275
So I think the thing that I try to do is to make sure that I'm telling these particular stories. Because there will come a time when there's nobody left to tell them. I mean, the neighborhood has changed enough so that I can read the tea leaves. I can see what's going on. So that's the second piece that I want to share. It's called I Came for the Stories. OK. Shoot.

61
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:40,282
I came for the stories of how you built this place, from the entrelles, from the dregs, from the unwashed and the unwanted. The only piece of the city they'd let you have, but you built it with pine and pegs and poles and persistence with the beauty of duty and the substance of faith.

62
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:58,234
I came for the stories of the heroes and the unheralded, of the legacy makers and the territory takers and the boundary shakers and the barrier breakers, the first ones to do the big thing, the bold thing, the forbidden, the unfamiliar, the courageous thing.

63
00:26:58,473 --> 00:27:23,899
I came for the stories, the ones you say for your children, and their children, and their children. Anansi stories, Shaka Zulu stories, Sheba stories, Hannibal stories, Toussaint stories, Sojourner stories, Malcolm, Marcus, Martin, and Medgar stories. Epic, heroic, and tragic truth of how we came over and what we've overcome.

64
00:27:24,735 --> 00:27:47,654
I came for the stories, all of them, lost, stolen, or strayed, because history can't be real for me, can't reveal to me, can't appeal to me without showing the black and the brown and the tan. Whitewashing so clearly our critical race theory just tells me we are nearly erasing a past we will pay for dearly.

65
00:27:47,654 --> 00:28:17,108
I came for the stories only poets can tell, magical tales that cast a spell, living water from the griot's well, distinct drumming in a faraway bell, the seas reply in a queen conch shell, the salted air as the billows swell, an archangel triumphs, a demon fell, giants flee from where Davids dwell, lest they drown in a deepening stell, legion is vanquished and sent back to hell, the riot ends with a mournful yell, the ode is recorded,

66
00:28:17,108 --> 00:28:45,350
from District to Dell. I came for the stories, and I will not leave as I am beseeching beyond my own reaching for all you are teaching the sermons you're preaching where black knows no bleaching of borders we're breaching and hatred is leeching and rage is screeching for love's impeaching. I came for the stories. I came for the stories.

67
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:48,643
I came for the stories.

68
00:28:53,916 --> 00:29:22,483
Well, Terry, you know that I've been a big fan of yours. I love your poetry. And I was so happy in twenty twenty one when Terry became the poet, the first poet laureate of Medford. And I wondered now there's another poet laureate Vijaya Sundaram. And I wonder. As you look back on your experience being the poet laureate, what stands out for you?

69
00:29:23,882 --> 00:29:52,637
It's interesting because there was no blueprint. Medford, in fact, didn't necessarily know how to do it, and so with some kind of background guidance, they were able to kind of pick up on the model that was in place in Somerville, who had had a poet laureate for a number of years now, and build a model

70
00:29:52,637 --> 00:30:22,278
But I wasn't given a lot of specific tasks. So I just kind of created my own kind of way to go. And it's consisted of some inaugural poetry. It's consisted of some poetry for special occasions, poetry for Juneteenth, poetry for Pride Month, and a couple of other city celebrations. And visiting in the schools, especially during COVID,

71
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:38,660
workshops for the schools, virtual workshops for the schools. How did the students receive you? We've always had a love relationship, not a love-hate relationship. They're pretty fascinated.

72
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:56,664
by poetry. Thank you. So I think that Vijaya's task will be to kind of maybe look at some of the things that I've done and then kind of build on that model so that every couple of years as a new poet laureate comes in,

73
00:30:56,664 --> 00:31:13,916
there'll be more and more layers to what the city's expectations and what the possibilities would be. Because that was the other thing, without a blueprint, I don't think either of us really had a sense of what the possibilities would be. But if you, behind the...

74
00:31:15,725 --> 00:31:34,633
The Andrews School, there is a, it's by the river, it's right by the river, the Mystic River is right there, and there's walking trails behind there, it's really a nice area. But if you go behind the Andrews, there's actually a,

75
00:31:37,125 --> 00:32:03,729
there's a peace park. The landscape architect calls it a Triskelion. So it's a three-point maze. And in the maze, the maze is constructed of cement paths with rocks guiding you through the maze. And there are three points in the maze which have a piece of poetry, a piece of a poem.

76
00:32:03,729 --> 00:32:14,821
So I wrote, I was able to write that poetry and then the other thing that it's done for me is it's made me really notorious because

77
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:44,804
David Fichter, a muralist from... I know David. Yeah, from Cambridge and Somerville. That's right. He's been around a long time. Yeah, a long time. So for 27 years, he's been painting two mural panels on the embankment across from the Somerville projects on Mystic Avenue that the paintings describe the life along the Mystic River.

78
00:32:44,804 --> 00:33:06,340
So a couple years ago, now, well, not a couple years, a year ago, a little more than a year ago, he calls me here at the community center. He says, you know, can I bring a group of kids by? I want you to talk to them about poetry and maybe do a little workshop with them. So I said, sure, you know, come on by. Yeah, absolutely.

79
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:23,012
So he brings the kids by, take them to a sound installation, and they get to hear Hard by the Mystic. You know Hard by the Mystic. And then we come to the community center, and we do the little poetry workshop, and everybody's happy. And David takes the kids, and he goes off.

80
00:33:23,012 --> 00:33:52,346
A couple days later, he calls me and he says, can I come back and take some pictures? So I think he wants to take some pictures of the neighborhood, you know, West Medford, interesting place. We had talked about a lot of different things. So he comes, he brings his, he got a nice fancy camera. He comes and he says, okay, well, let's go over to the park. So I figure, okay, so I wanna take some pictures of Duggar Park, you know, the back of the community center, all kinds of different things. So he says, okay, well, you know, are you ready? And I said, ready for what? He says, I wanna take some pictures of you.

81
00:33:52,346 --> 00:34:20,060
Oh, you want to take pictures of me. Long story short, he takes the pictures. Next day, I get sketches. Pretty soon, some paintings come, and I'm to be immortalized on the last two panels of the mural. And it's 27 years in the making, so there are well over 50 panels. Right, I'm unaware of that. Yeah, and it's 400 or 500 yards of mural.

82
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,865
Yes, I remember when I was riding by and I looked.

83
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:51,510
Why, that's Terry Carter. Oh, my God. How wonderful. Yeah, it is. It is wonderful. It's like 10 to 12 feet tall and emblazoned through the front of my garment is a snippet of hired by the mystic, the poem hired by the mystic. So it looks just like you. It does look like me. Absolutely. I'm not you know, I'm not mad at David. He's a wonderful artist. Yes, he is.

84
00:34:51,988 --> 00:35:09,906
So, I don't, what was, what was I, what was the question? Okay, my next question is, when did Words and Music first begin? Oh, geez. And how? I'll say it like this. We're, we're into the 60s in terms of the number of shows that we've done.

85
00:35:09,906 --> 00:35:39,326
And you figure we do, on average, 8 to 10 shows a year. So it's several years. And I didn't start it. I didn't do the first show. A former board member and a principal at Somerville Community Access Television, she wanted to come over and do something with the community center. So the first show.

86
00:35:39,326 --> 00:35:55,418
I wasn't there. And then Bill Hager, who was the executive director at the time, he said, well, I would like for you to host this program. And I said, OK, what the heck. And the rest is history.

87
00:35:55,418 --> 00:36:22,329
So we kind of took over the show. Somerville Community Access Television faded away. Fortunately, we have Medford Community Media running to the breach, and they've been broadcasting our show ever since. So like I say, if you go through the full archive, there's probably 50 to 60 shows in the can. It's very rich. And we've done a bunch of good stuff. We've interviewed mayors, and we've

88
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:45,759
You know, we've had great discussions about, you know, public health and obviously the neighborhood, changing in the neighborhood, all kinds of different conversations, panels and individuals. And you're just a wonderful, wonderful interviewer. You're not doing so bad yourself. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you so much. Very good. No, you're so kind and you create such a warm

89
00:36:45,759 --> 00:37:01,374
environment for everybody. Thank you. And it's really lovely to listen to every interview you do. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. OK, so let's see, what are two of your most memorable interviews?

90
00:37:03,131 --> 00:37:21,391
I think the first interview I had with Mayor Brianna when she was running for her first mayoral stint. I remember that, yeah. Because it was one of the few interviews where I was actually nervous.

91
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:48,473
Why were you nervous? Well, you know, you know, I thought that she was going to win, you know, and I had already interviewed Stephanie. Yeah. And, you know, it's funny because her office called and they didn't demand, but it was clear that they were looking for equal time. Sure. So we scheduled her that very month and it was right before the election in.

92
00:37:48,473 --> 00:38:18,319
you know, I just had a sense that, you know, a change was coming. And when I interviewed her, I had, you know, my stomach was kind of knotted up. I don't think anybody knew, but I was nervous. So that's that's memorable to me. You never looked nervous. Yeah. And I think the other it wasn't necessarily a a a an interview. It was a panel and on the panel were

93
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:25,930
Let's see, I think Melanie McLaughlin was on the panel. My sister, my older sister was on the panel.

94
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:55,026
I think Henry Malorum was on the panel, and they were talking about children with disabilities, because one of Melanie's daughters has Down syndrome, and my sister has a highly high-functioning autistic son, and Henry has an autistic son. And it was a wonderful discussion, very, very rich. So those kinds of conversations have always kind of been like my favorites.

95
00:38:55,026 --> 00:39:24,155
Sometimes I think we're all on the spectrum. Yeah. Creativity runs rampant in Terry's family. His wife, Teresa, is a brilliant modern dancer. And his daughter is an actress, Maya. We all saw her in a play recently. It was just great. And I know you, Terry, are also a painter.

96
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:53,387
How and when did you start painting? You know, one, Eileen, I haven't painted for years. No? No. And it's not because I don't love it. It's just because the poetry took over. Kind of like the full of my creative spectrum became, you know, driven by poetry. I saw your paintings here one time when you brought them in. That's why I thought you were still active. No, I have I have done some some visual art stuff.

97
00:39:53,387 --> 00:40:20,674
But painting is a serious commitment for me, because one, I paint oils, so they take a long time to dry and cure and all of that stuff, and they're messy. And two, because I consider myself very fastidious. So I treat the paintings the same way I treat the poetry. Every word, every color, every, you know. It's all the same to me. So what I've decided is that I'm gonna write seven

98
00:40:20,674 --> 00:40:38,507
books in the brown skin series I've even got the title for the next one I'm not gonna say it and then I'm gonna put the writing aside and I'm gonna focus a little bit on visual arts great yeah I'm do some painting great so my wife wants new artwork in the house too I see and cheap

99
00:40:39,360 --> 00:41:08,916
At a good price, right? Mama gets what mama wants. Yeah. OK. So one thing Terry didn't mention is that I'm a writer, too. Absolutely. But I've only written one poem in my whole life. And I'm going to recite my poem now. OK. Sometimes the children grow like flowers. Sometimes the children grow like weeds. I like the children both ways. I help plant the seeds. That's it.

100
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:31,476
Wow. Yeah, it's beautiful. Yeah, it's quite nice. My one and only poem. Yes. I used to have a column in the Medford Transcript. But as you know, the Medford Transcript has expired, like so many other things. But anyway, I would like to ask you to recite

101
00:41:31,476 --> 00:41:47,637
Queen of the Village about Dorothy Elizabeth Tucker. Because Dorothy Elizabeth Tucker, I met her when I moved into Medford about nine years ago. She was part of a Medford Conversations project.

102
00:41:47,637 --> 00:42:16,135
And in my group, and we met at my house for several months, and we became friends. And eventually, she invited, she said to me, you know, Eileen, you should come on down to the West Medford Community Center. And I said, oh, because I never even heard about it before then. And I came down, and I met everybody, and I was hooked. And I've been coming here ever since, and I'm so

103
00:42:16,613 --> 00:42:32,432
grateful to everybody here, because I don't think I'd have a community without the West Medford, or as much of a community as I do, without this place. Go ahead, take it away.

104
00:42:34,155 --> 00:42:52,517
Okay, so, just a quick aside, Dorothy was, she was a lioness in this community, you know, just made of different stuff.

105
00:42:52,517 --> 00:43:10,384
Some of that will be reflected in the piece that I'm going to read about her. And she, you know, she had a wonderful life. I don't think that she would be unhappy about any of the 90 plus years she spent with us. But she was very, very inspirational as a person.

106
00:43:10,384 --> 00:43:32,466
When she belonged to the senior club, they always do meditations to begin their meetings, and Dorothy, for the most part, would do those meditations. Now, another lovely woman of the Ville, Edna Gavin, does the meditations. Edna's sitting back there. She'll be shy.

107
00:43:32,466 --> 00:43:48,985
She's right here. Yeah, but she does the meditations and they're equally as lovely, but it was always something inspirational that she would have to say to get the meeting started. So this piece I read at her homegoing celebration.

108
00:43:48,985 --> 00:44:07,142
which was glorious and featured a second line New Orleans style jazz band marching through the streets of Medford from the church to her house. It was just amazing to see and to be a part of. So this is called The Queen of the Village.

109
00:44:07,142 --> 00:44:23,968
We didn't always do the things you wanted us to do. We couldn't always know the things that you already knew. And when we couldn't find the key to unlock every riddle, you found us each a starting place, a finish, and a middle.

110
00:44:23,968 --> 00:44:51,442
You very rarely chastised us except to make us stronger. You taught us each and every day to make our dreams last longer. You taught us each our history with questions we should ponder. You made us seek the mystery of what waits over yonder. No one danced the way you could beyond the reach of 90, the way you let the music move you, bubbling brown and shiny.

111
00:44:51,442 --> 00:45:08,080
Here among the many friends you touched each and every day, no one dares deny the love you shared along the way. The truth that you reveal with every poem and story reminds us how this neighborhood was graced by God's own glory.

112
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:31,476
You wanted nothing better than for each to find some peace and prayed with us to find the ways for anger just to cease. You'd pray sometimes for God's great might. You'd meditate for special insight. You'd say a little pleasing rhyme. Perhaps you'd sing a song. You'd lead us in a rhythmic chant and shepherd us along.

113
00:45:31,476 --> 00:45:48,865
You gave yourself so freely to the center and the church. We knew just where to find you, we seldom had to search. This place we call the ville shall ever be in your great debt. It's something that we know we must repay and not forget.

114
00:45:48,865 --> 00:46:07,227
You hurried at times, but you very rarely rushed. You saw the rose's beauty in each petal that you touched. Each friend's affection was reflected when you blushed. Each baby's blessing was commended when you gushed. Every heart enlightened and never a spirit crushed.

115
00:46:07,756 --> 00:46:26,049
You loved yourself, but rightly, and not in selfish vain. You loved what you created, but you didn't begrudge the pain. You loved God's purpose in you and danced in his sweet reign. You loved God's purpose for you and the queenship of your reign.

116
00:46:26,305 --> 00:46:43,985
Your life was like a sermon, so you didn't have to preach. Your walk was like a lesson that your children watched you teach. Your praise was for all seasons well beyond what others reach. Your ministry was grace and love, such kindness in your speech.

117
00:46:43,985 --> 00:47:01,220
You vaulted oh so lightly over barriers of race. You held your friends so tightly that each knew their special place. You never let your dignity be challenged by debaters. Your sharing of the trinity confounded all the haters.

118
00:47:02,329 --> 00:47:20,879
We marvel now in your retreat at stars you kissed in passing, all the cords you braided with the threads you were amassing. Now we know the tapestry is fine beyond surpassing. Now we see you strut beyond all demons and trespassing.

119
00:47:21,203 --> 00:47:38,729
Few have run this marathon as gracefully as you. Few have been so loving, so forgiving, and so true. Few have weathered all the seasons that your life has seen. Now they understand the reason why we call you queen.

120
00:47:38,729 --> 00:47:54,906
You learned to be alone, but never ever were you lonely. You couldn't be distracted by the trickster or the phony. You went before your children when the road was rough and stony. In every confrontation, you revealed your testimony.

121
00:47:55,555 --> 00:48:14,053
We'll try our best to dance to our own song as memories prevail. We'll try our best to move to every lyric and detail. We'll recollect the harmony you taught with your travail and love each day we spent with you along life's winding trail.

122
00:48:14,053 --> 00:48:41,101
We'll do our best to get back up, even if we fall, and listen to your spirit's voice every time you call. We'll learn the waltz of unity you choreograph for all, and then we'll dance together at Queen Dorothy Tucker's Ball. Yes, then we'll dance together at Queen Dorothy Tucker's Ball.

123
00:48:41,442 --> 00:48:57,227
Just wonderful, just wonderful. Thank you. So today, many of us went to a funeral in Dorchester for Dottie Walker, who passed last Sunday. And I wonder if you plan to write a poem about Dottie.

124
00:48:58,012 --> 00:49:15,111
You know, it's funny, Dottie was a good friend of mine, and I knew her children pretty well, especially some of the kids on the Mumford side of her family, as well as Edwin and

125
00:49:15,111 --> 00:49:30,367
And Chris Walker, who became her stepchildren when she married Edwin Sr. Chris and Taji, I mean Taji and John, her Mumford children, were actually deacons with me at my church in Stoughton.

126
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:51,152
So it's very possible. Dottie was funny. She made people laugh. I think that was one of her chief gifts. She was a very humorous woman. So maybe if the spirit of laughter gets a hold of me sometimes, I'll try something.

127
00:49:51,152 --> 00:50:09,445
And Dottie was so loving, so loving, and they had a slideshow of photographs of her from when she was a child, and she just always had the most beautiful, happy look on her face. I wish I could be that happy all the time.

128
00:50:09,514 --> 00:50:35,742
Well, you know, sometimes if you and Dottie stood next to each other, you couldn't tell whether you were sisters or not. Oh, really? We had a good time together. We laughed a lot. And I will miss her. I've spent a lot of time this past week thinking about her. It just seems incredible that we won't hear her voice, the sound of her laughter, see her walking in the door.

129
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:57,739
Yeah, it's so sad. But her spirit is in this place. And it's the beauty of the community center is, I mean, you can look at the 28 portraits that we have in the West Medford Elder Photo Project, and you can tell that the spirit of all of these people infuses the ground we're on right now.

130
00:50:57,739 --> 00:51:18,660
Absolutely, absolutely. So Eileen, thank you so much for bringing your thoughtful questions, your literary curiosity, and your tenacious engagement in this community for turning the tables on me, so to speak. And thanks for being willing to come off the bench this evening and flip the script.

131
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:46,971
And to everyone watching, thanks so much for your intendedness and your interest in our discussion. Get ready for something very special on the musical side of the coin right after we take a break to reset our stage and share some WMCC announcements. So there's beverages and some snacks in the back, so please, we'll be right back. And buy some books. All right.

132
00:57:03,217 --> 00:57:30,367
Hello, folks. We're about ready if we can get you to grab your seats. Okay.

133
00:57:35,196 --> 00:58:04,582
I'll talk to you afterwards. Yeah, thank you. So, okay. So, here are the promotionals for this evening. As always, elders, join us each week, Tuesday through Thursday, for a nutritious lunch and a vibrant fellowship. Eileen talked about it a little bit.

134
00:58:04,582 --> 00:58:22,688
Lunch is served at 12 noon. Call 781-483-3042 to make a reservation. We also want to remember to thank everyone that participated in our annual Black Vendor Fair over the holiday weekend.

135
00:58:22,688 --> 00:58:48,097
It was a great community event, and folks that bought and folks that sold were all very happy. Some unique stuff went out the door. We also want to thank everyone who contributed to the Center's coffers on Giving Tuesday last week. Suffice it to say, it was a very happy Tuesday for the WMCC.

136
00:58:48,097 --> 00:59:16,749
And then I also want to thank everyone who has purchased a brick in our new brick-by-brick installation. We already had about 90 bricks out there. We're gonna put about 80 more out there. Fully subscribed, every brick space taken, so it's gonna bring a lot of new life into that installation.

137
00:59:16,749 --> 00:59:45,162
And save the date, Monday, January 15, 2024, WMCC will once again be leading Medford's annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday observance in collaboration with the city's Office of Diversity and the Human Rights Commission. We hope for an even bigger celebration than last year's standing room only event here at the community center.

138
00:59:45,162 --> 01:00:07,892
Please stay tuned for more information. And then finally, Zumba is back at the WMCC on Wednesday evenings for a 30-minute sprint at 545. So if you're so inclined and physically able, come on out and dance. I think it's for all levels.

139
01:00:07,892 --> 01:00:33,268
And then, finally, how can you continue to help us? It's the end of the year, okay? And your tax-deductible donations can help to support the mission of the WMCC. Partner with us in carrying this mission forward. Please consider making a tax-deductible donation to this vital community organization. You can make your donation by phone, online, or by check.

140
01:00:33,268 --> 01:00:56,305
please contact Lisa Crossman, our esteemed executive director, at 781-483-3042 for more information or to become a member. Okay, so now, as I like to say, it's time to turn our attention to the lyrical miracle we've engaged for this evening.

141
01:00:57,176 --> 01:01:21,732
Dr. Renee Haywood has been singing since the age of four. She's also an educator, an author, and an ordained pastor. Renee, a West Medford native, has recorded several gospel albums, traveled the world for ministry, and been in Christian music leadership for over 25 years.

142
01:01:21,732 --> 01:01:51,340
She is currently the worship pastor at Resurrect Church in Brockton. Let me just tell you a quick note about Resurrect. Resurrect has a wonderful liturgical dance ministry, as does my church, under the leadership of my wife, Teresa. Right now, their worship, their liturgical worship leader, Alicia Syrian-Wells, and my wife, are on a plane heading to South Africa for a missions trip.

143
01:01:51,340 --> 01:02:08,302
to dance in celebration and praise and teaching and worship to the youth of the townships in Cape Town, South Africa. So we're both pretty proud right now on that account.

144
01:02:08,302 --> 01:02:33,080
Her daughter, Rayma, who is with her today, has also been singing since the tender age of four. She is an R&B songwriter and recording artist. She has performed several times at the Hard Rock Cafe and debuted an original song for First Night Boston. She is a licensed cosmetologist, and get this, following in the footsteps of her

145
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:57,637
great-great-grandmother, who is immortalized in that panel over there, Elizabeth Oliver Newton, who was a founding member of the Shiloh Baptist Church and a pillar in the West Medford community. Rayma plans to open her own salon, continuing both Elizabeth's legacy and her own songwriting career. Ladies and gentlemen,

146
01:02:57,637 --> 01:03:07,432
Prepare to be warmed up well beyond the cold outside of our doors. First Fridays presents Renee and Rayma Haywood.

147
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:45,708
Good evening. This is like mind-blowing just to be here and see the history. I know everyone on these walls. So I'm so grateful. Thank you so much for inviting us. We have a few songs, and then we're going to ask for your help at the end with a Christmas song. So get your pipes ready for the 12 days of Christmas. I'm going to pass out the words, or my lovely assistant there will pass out the words later. But we're just going to have a good time, OK? Amen. All right.

148
01:03:45,708 --> 01:04:09,053
We will not be shaken. We will not be moved.

Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We have to celebrate our joy, right? Yeah.
