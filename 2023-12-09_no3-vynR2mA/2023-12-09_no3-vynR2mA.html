    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=249.022s">Hey</a>  Terry, you know why Jews have long arms and short necks?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=255.029s">No,</a>  I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=255.41s">See,</a>  see, that's just stupid.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=267.418s">Good</a>  evening, friends and neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=268.859s">My</a>  name is Terry E. Cotter, and I direct elder services at our beloved West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=275.802s">Welcome</a>  to another live monthly presentation of First Friday's Words in Music, one of our official favorite events at WMCC. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=287.307s">It's</a>  December. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=289.028s">a</a>  traditional time of hope and faith and light for people all over the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=294.491s">Despite</a>  the fact that it's a bit cold outside, we're warm and toasty in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=300.534s">Thanks</a>  to a generous grant from the Medford Arts Council, a member of the Massachusetts Cultural Council, we are ready to celebrate the season at 111 Arlington Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=312.659s">We</a>  are, of course, still trying to be mindful of local health requirements and concerns, so masking is welcomed but not required. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=320.443s">On</a>  the whole this year, we've had many months of sponsoring live programming here at the WMCC and all over the city of Medford as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=331.169s">Please</a>  be courteous to your neighbors as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=333.55s">Through</a>  the evening, we are appreciating the media work put in by Kevin Harrington and Medford Community Media for guiding us as we broadcast to you via Medford Community Media channels 9 for Comcast and 47 for Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=350.941s">If</a>  you're out there watching on your electronic devices, welcome to the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=356.984s">So</a>  tonight's conversation is taking place as a true departure from what we usually do on First Fridays. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=364.332s">So</a>  I'm going to introduce my partner in crime for the evening, the community center's own Eileen Lerner. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=371.179s">Eileen?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=373.201s">Eileen</a>  is a relatively new WMCC board member, but she's no stranger to many who are here on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=381.883s">She's</a>  been a Medford resident for many years, and an active and engaged member of the West Medford Senior Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=389.364s">Eileen</a>  is also a longtime human rights activist, a journalist, and a former teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=396.666s">She</a>  speaks her mind, and tonight what we're gonna do is let her. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=401.807s">Eileen,</a>  what's on your mind this evening?</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=406.674s">No,</a>  I'm taking this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=409.218s">What's</a>  on my mind is I'm the interviewer and you are the interviewee. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=415.527s">So</a>  let's change chairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=440.2s">Okay,</a>  so, wow, this is so much fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=444.07s">I</a>  get to ask Terry questions, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=448.26s">and</a>  questions that I've always thought about. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=451.001s">Okay,</a>  but first I have to read his biography. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=455.202s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=456.122s">Terry</a>  E. Carter is a gifted writer, poet, and speaker who has been writing and developing his craft for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=464.885s">He</a>  is a classically trained poet with literary influences that range from Shakespeare to the Harlem Renaissance. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=473.127s">Terry</a>  is a sought-after poet and presenter on a variety of topics related to black history, faith, and contemporary culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=483.412s">He</a>  has published six volumes of poetry, including his newly completed book, Brown Skin and the Brilliant Sun, a poet's opus released <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=498.228s">in</a>  October. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=499.849s">Terry</a>  E. Carter was named the inaugural Poet Laureate of Medford Mass in the summer of 2021 and completed his two-year term at the end of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=511.533s">Terry</a>  is an ordained deacon and arts minister at Jubilee Christian Church of Stoughton. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=518.716s">He</a>  directs elder services <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=521.474s">and</a>  special programs in the West Medford community, and is married to Teresa Carter, an ordained pastor and liturgical dance leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=535.219s">So,</a>  well, I have my own, so you have yours, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=539.461s">So</a>  Terry, many of us know that you were introduced to poetry in Medford High School by a really excellent teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=548.894s">But</a>  I've always wondered, what was it about poetry rather than other forms of writing <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=556.004s">For</a>  example, fiction, nonfiction, journalism. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=559.405s">What</a>  was it about poetry that grabbed you and made it become your genre of choice?</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=567.206s">That's</a>  a really good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=569.346s">Well,</a>  as you mentioned, I was indeed introduced to poetry at Medford High School, freshman or sophomore year. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=578.628s">I</a>  had an English teacher by the name of Eleanor Kookavidis, beautiful Greek lady. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=585.949s">And</a>  she gave me a little volume of Langston Hughes's poetry, and I was off and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=591.731s">Now,</a>  I always liked to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=594.372s">Growing</a>  up as a kid, I was a comic book reader, had a big collection of comic books. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=600.854s">So</a>  there definitely were other genres of writing that I was interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=607.516s">And</a>  I had kind of started writing some little short stories and things of my own. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=613.017s">But</a>  when the poetry bug grabbed me, I was kind of grabbed for good. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=618.399s">I've</a>  had to learn how to write for professional life, and I've written all kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=625.943s">And</a>  then when I went to graduate school at BU, <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=629.644s">obviously</a>  the writing came back into play because Mass Comm, one of the tracks was broadcast journalism. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=639.271s">And</a>  I was in that track, so I had to refine my writing for the news media, et cetera, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=646.836s">But</a>  I didn't go down that road professionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=650.638s">But</a>  writing has always been something that has <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=655.373s">stood</a>  me in good stead, I would say, in my professional life. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=659.234s">But</a>  the poetry is the thing that really, really kind of lights my fire, so to speak.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=664.296s">Yes,</a>  I hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=665.176s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=666.496s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=667.277s">What</a>  was the subject of the very first poem you ever wrote?</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=672.138s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=673.239s">And</a>  listen, you know, everybody's got a roses are red, violets are blue poem in them somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=678.9s">So</a>  I have to assume that I probably wrote some little ditties when I was trying to get up. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=684.722s">No,</a>  well, you know, I tried to unremember a lot of stuff that would get me in trouble with my current relationships. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=692.447s">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=693.167s">So</a>  if I wrote another poem, if I wrote a poem to another woman earlier in my life, I'm trying not to remember that.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=700.051s">I</a>  hear you.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=700.531s">I</a>  don't want to throw that up in my wife's face.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=702.232s">That</a>  was a wise choice.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=703.353s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=703.813s">But</a>  the first serious poem, serious poems I'll say, <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=708.656s">I</a>  wrote this really scathing indictment of, and this is pre-hip-hop, pre-rap, of <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=719.986s">Watergate.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=721.686s">And</a>  I remember the first couple lines were, listen, my children, and you shall hear of the Watergate big political smear. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=731.909s">And</a>  then it went on and on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=734.829s">So</a>  Nixon and Haldeman and Ehrlichman and Dean.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=740.25s">And</a>  you rhymed all those?</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=741.471s">Yeah,</a>  I rhymed all those. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=742.351s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=743.151s">In</a>  the White House mystery mischief machine, I'm sure that was a piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=748.252s">So</a>  that was pretty serious, but the one that I remember best was a poem called All My Heroes are Black Men. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=757.416s">And</a>  I wrote that as a paean to growing up and then finally discovering the richness of black history. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=766.86s">And</a>  I wrote about all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=769.841s">in</a>  that poem. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=770.982s">And</a>  that was one of the poems that was kind of the framework for my first book, Brown Skin and the Bread of Life, A Poet's Journey.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=780.133s">How</a>  old were you at that time?</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=784.5s">I</a>  wrote that poem years and years and years before I actually published the book, so I have to, I think I was probably about 18, 19. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=793.163s">Yeah,</a>  I think I was in college when I wrote that. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=796.284s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=796.725s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=798.265s">And</a>  when did you publish your very first book?</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=800.706s">That's</a>  a good, it's another good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=803.467s">It's</a>  an interesting story because <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=808.274s">I</a>  was... 2009, I was working for a career development organization for high-talent students of color called En-ROADS, a national organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=820.719s">And</a>  what we did is we would recruit the students, go to the different schools and grab the students, <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=827.462s">And</a>  then we would put them through a training regimen, you know, and teaching them everything from professional etiquette to dressing for business, all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=836.788s">And</a>  part and parcel to that was finding them really high-grade internships in Fortune 500 companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=845.253s">And</a>  I had a portfolio of companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=846.774s">I</a>  had Bleach, I had... <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=849.535s">Liberty</a>  Mutual, MetLife, a lot of insurance firms, that was my silo. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=857.246s">So</a>  I loved that job, I was at that job for almost 11 years and they had this big organizational shake-up <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=867.819s">and</a>  a lot of folks lost their jobs, and I was part of a lot of folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=872.402s">So</a>  that year, there's an old saying that when God closes a door, he opens a window.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=880.707s">Mama</a>  always said that.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=881.847s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=882.888s">So</a>  what happened was I was trying to figure out how I was going to fill my time, and two things happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=889.231s">I</a>  wrote my first book, I think I published in 2010, and then <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=897.734s">roughly</a>  around the same time, maybe a little bit after, I got invited to take the job as director of elder services here at the community center.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=905.984s">And</a>  how did that come about?</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=909.207s">One</a>  of my good friends, <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=912.931s">Calvin</a>  Lindsey Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=914.713s">was</a>  actually the President of the Board of Directors at the time, and he said, you know, Terry, we just, we're gonna lose our Director of Elder Services for a couple different reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=925.381s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=926.121s">You</a>  think it might be something you'd be interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=928.383s">I</a>  wasn't working. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=929.684s">He</a>  said, it's just part-time, but, you know, you get to be in Medford more often, you get to hang out with your people. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=937.83s">Because</a>  I was in Randolph. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=939.251s">My</a>  wife and I had relocated to Randolph. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=941.032s">So</a>  I took the job.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=944.514s">So,</a>  as someone who was born and bred in West Medford, what led you to move out of your beloved community and eventually leading you and your family to move to Randolph?</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=957.284s">We</a>  got priced out. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=959.126s">I'm</a>  going to be perfectly plain with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=962.09s">Well,</a>  there were two things, two mitigating factors. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=966.155s">The</a>  first was my wife was actually working for a city department in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=972.803s">and</a>  she was six months away from being grandfathered when they pressed the residency requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=980.53s">So</a>  we had to go into Boston, or else she would have lost her job. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=987.715s">But</a>  we moved into Boston, we got an apartment in Dorchester, nice, enjoyed it, but we were also thinking about buying, so we started looking a little bit, and we looked at Medford, and we couldn't touch Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1002.528s">It</a>  was just, you know, couldn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1005.091s">Prohibitively</a>  expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1006.412s">Prohibitively</a>  expensive.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1007.453s">And</a>  gotten more so every year.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1009.636s">Yeah,</a>  so we stayed in Boston in two different apartments in Dorchester and then a stint of time with my mother-in-law as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1020.548s">for</a>  close to 16 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1023.872s">And</a>  then we said this is crazy, especially because the area of Dorchester that we were in, this is the second apartment, had gotten pretty gamey. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1035.005s">There</a>  was a lot of shootings, there was a lot of crazy stuff going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1038.929s">In</a>  the street that we lived on, at the top of the street, there were a couple of brownstones. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1045.171s">And</a>  there was all manner of scurrilous activity taking place in those brownstones. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1051.052s">I</a>  mean, all kinds of activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1053.733s">And</a>  the police were up and down the street all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1056.354s">So</a>  we just finally. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1057.654s">We</a>  got war down, and we started looking again. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1060.517s">We</a>  looked south, and Randolph ended up being the community that we settled on, and we were able to buy a really nice house in Randolph.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1069.846s">It</a>  is pretty. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1071.047s">My</a>  son used to live there.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1072.349s">Was</a>  that right?</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1072.909s">Conrad</a>  lived there when his kids were young, so I'm familiar with Randolph. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1077.434s">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1078.355s">So</a>  I'm curious about <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1082.519s">What</a>  are the messages that you want people to get from your poetry? <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1086.682s">What</a>  are you trying to communicate to people?</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1091.686s">I</a>  don't know if we got time for me to tell you all of it, but I'll definitely tell you some of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1095.628s">So</a>  why don't we do it like this? <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1098.591s">Let</a>  me tell you a little bit about it, and then I'll just read a couple pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1102.954s">And</a>  that way, folks will get a bit of an idea.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1105.216s">I</a>  think that's a good idea.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1106.697s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1107.157s">OK,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1111.374s">I</a>  was very much faith-driven when I wrote my first book, Brown Skin and the Bread of Life, the bread of life being Jesus Christ, you know, biblically. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1124.887s">But</a>  I was also driven by a desire to connect with history, you know, African American history in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1131.673s">I</a>  was driven by the influences of music in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1135.158s">I</a>  love jazz, so jazz is in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1138.522s">I</a>  wanted to be able to write some things that I could then pass on generationally. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1145.41s">And</a>  I've always considered myself a storyteller. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1150.817s">So</a>  I wanted to be able to tell some stories as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1154.258s">So</a>  I think those are the major influences. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1159.1s">But</a>  coming back to West Medford and being here ended up being actually a bigger influence than many of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1169.503s">And</a>  I'll explain why when I read one of these pieces I'm going to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1174.244s">So</a>  all of those things, all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1177.786s">So</a>  let me read a piece, kind of get you, kind of answer your question even a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1184.969s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1185.49s">Okay,</a>  so as I said, Medford, West Medford in particular became a very big influence in my writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1195.014s">particularly</a>  because of the creeping gentrification that was taking place when I came back to the neighborhood, and how difficult it was for folks like myself who wanted to come back to Medford to be able to find a place where they could. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1213.303s">But</a>  I found my place here at the community center, so I'm not mad at anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1218.245s">But</a>  I wanna talk a little bit about some of the things that I've seen, especially over the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1224.628s">So</a>  this piece is called Mystic River Melancholy. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1229.21s">The</a>  freshly quaffed boho boys make real estate videos extolling the finer virtues of West Medford and life along the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1238.594s">Maybe</a>  they're new money kids or Tufts grads. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1241.976s">They</a>  don't know the rich history of the village. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1245.257s">They</a>  do have a sense that this is a minor mecca for ex-city dwellers, flush with IPO cash, NFT windfalls, or Bitcoin early adoptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1255.903s">A</a>  new gentry that wants to be landed for their dogs, and their Range Rovers, and their wine tastings, and the next generation of trust fund babies. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1266.229s">The</a>  would-be property princes have a target market. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1269.695s">The</a>  YouTube appeal is slick and shiny. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1272.78s">Classic</a>  Americana with a side of sushi or a venti mocha latte. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1278.066s">They</a>  have no idea of what used to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1280.627s">They</a>  know what the next wave wants to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1283.809s">They</a>  want to see the bikes, the hikes, and their kids on trikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1287.832s">They</a>  want to post pics that get lots of likes. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1291.013s">They</a>  want to see the flowering trees and the birds and the bees. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1294.355s">Their</a>  high-rise havens had none of these. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1297.477s">They</a>  want to see if they can grow something green in a backyard garden beyond the green that's growing in their bulging bank accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1305.174s">Designer</a>  overalls and Doc Martens do not a farmer make. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1309.682s">No</a>  worries, Whole Foods has gone 100% organic with a great selection of finely curated herbs and spices. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1318.672s">I</a>  know this sounds like resentment. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1321.274s">Resignation</a>  frequently does. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1323.755s">But</a>  when the private boat clubs bookend the public beach and the abutters don't want loud, unruly Dominicans descending on their hillsides for beachfront parking, well, what's a brother from the Ville to think? <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1337.944s">My</a>  daddy taught me how to fish here. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1340.745s">Not</a>  much more than eels and sunfish in the water then, but it felt like legacy, and we were happy to have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1349.261s">They</a>  really didn't want us at their beach back then either, but we were mighty in our minority. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1356.744s">We</a>  didn't want to fight folks, but the lake wasn't exactly pristine, so why begrudge it to anybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1364.133s">We</a>  could walk that half mile or ride our stingray bikes down there and feel connected to the small waves in the gentle wake. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1371.475s">We</a>  could wonder about the kayakers and the canoe paddlers, the colorful sunfishers, occasional scullers, and the ubiquitous motor boaters. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1381.017s">We</a>  could dream a little dream about owning a dinghy and a trawling engine and maybe making a few waves of our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1388.699s">Don't</a>  get me wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1390.066s">I</a>  love the new fish ladders and the intrepid herring counters, the trout infusion, the bald eagle sightings, and the focus on environmental sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1400.669s">Thing</a>  is, they love it too, and they can pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1406.451s">1.4</a>  mil for Queen Dorothy Elizabeth Tucker's old homestead. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1411.112s">It</a>  should have been a historical landmark. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1413.753s">Instead,</a>  it's yet another preview of coming attractions. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1417.893s">Meanwhile,</a>  the sleepy little Nubian Hamlet has released its black and brown patina to the inexorable tug of real property values and the dying off of the old guard. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1430.016s">Mine</a>  is the last generation that knew about the first three streets, Arlington, Lincoln, and Jerome, that knew about the little store, the old Shiloh Baptist, and the library in the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1445.499s">Mine</a>  is the last generation that knew about Charlie Booker and the Bruins, the five fighting Phillips brothers, Uncle Buddy's postal command, Doc Count's blue books, Faucina and Evelyn's beauty salon, and exactly why it's called Duggar Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1462.953s">So</a>  many firsts, so much history, so little time to savor and to save, to preserve and to pass on. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1472.056s">So</a>  many departures, so few arrivals of the black and the brown and the tan. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1478.698s">Meanwhile,</a>  the developers mostly have their way. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1481.8s">The</a>  Spanish day laborers tear it down and build it back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1486.252s">Like</a>  Lee Majors and the $6 million man, they have the technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1490.755s">They</a>  can make them better than they were, better, stronger, faster. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1495.798s">Condos</a>  and townhouses, Tony and Trendy, out with the old, in with the new, wash, rinse, and repeat. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1504.784s">Meanwhile,</a>  the freshly quaffed boho boys make real estate videos, extolling the finer virtues of West Medford and life along the Mystic River.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1520.31s">Wow,</a>  Terry, that's powerful. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1522.591s">I</a>  feel it, because I lived in West Cambridge for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1527.172s">And</a>  West Cambridge is undergoing the same change that West Medford is. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1533.214s">And</a>  when I talk to my neighbors, they say, oh, Eileen, nobody's here anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1538.995s">And</a>  nobody's smiling and saying hello as people move in. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1543.937s">So</a>  it's a loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1545.817s">It's</a>  a big loss and a tragedy, really.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1549.75s">So</a>  I think the thing that I try to do is to make sure that I'm telling these particular stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1558.431s">Because</a>  there will come a time when there's nobody left to tell them. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1563.592s">I</a>  mean, the neighborhood has changed enough so that I can read the tea leaves. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1569.253s">I</a>  can see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1571.094s">So</a>  that's the second piece that I want to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1575.254s">It's</a>  called I Came for the Stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1577.195s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1578.015s">Shoot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1579.575s">I</a>  came for the stories of how you built this place, from the entrelles, from the dregs, from the unwashed and the unwanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1589.118s">The</a>  only piece of the city they'd let you have, but you built it with pine and pegs and poles and persistence with the beauty of duty and the substance of faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1600.702s">I</a>  came for the stories of the heroes and the unheralded, of the legacy makers and the territory takers and the boundary shakers and the barrier breakers, the first ones to do the big thing, the bold thing, the forbidden, the unfamiliar, the courageous thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1618.593s">I</a>  came for the stories, the ones you say for your children, and their children, and their children. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1625.435s">Anansi</a>  stories, Shaka Zulu stories, Sheba stories, Hannibal stories, Toussaint stories, Sojourner stories, Malcolm, Marcus, Martin, and Medgar stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1638.038s">Epic,</a>  heroic, and tragic truth of how we came over and what we've overcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1644.835s">I</a>  came for the stories, all of them, lost, stolen, or strayed, because history can't be real for me, can't reveal to me, can't appeal to me without showing the black and the brown and the tan. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1659.427s">Whitewashing</a>  so clearly our critical race theory just tells me we are nearly erasing a past we will pay for dearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1667.994s">I</a>  came for the stories only poets can tell, magical tales that cast a spell, living water from the griot's well, distinct drumming in a faraway bell, the seas reply in a queen conch shell, the salted air as the billows swell, an archangel triumphs, a demon fell, giants flee from where Davids dwell, lest they drown in a deepening stell, legion is vanquished and sent back to hell, the riot ends with a mournful yell, the ode is recorded, <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1697.268s">from</a>  District to Dell. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1699.61s">I</a>  came for the stories, and I will not leave as I am beseeching beyond my own reaching for all you are teaching the sermons you're preaching where black knows no bleaching of borders we're breaching and hatred is leeching and rage is screeching for love's impeaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1720.446s">I</a>  came for the stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1722.988s">I</a>  came for the stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1725.889s">I</a>  came for the stories.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1733.976s">Well,</a>  Terry, you know that I've been a big fan of yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1737.957s">I</a>  love your poetry. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1739.977s">And</a>  I was so happy in twenty twenty one when Terry became the poet, the first poet laureate of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1749.02s">And</a>  I wondered now there's another poet laureate Vijaya Sundaram. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1755.301s">And</a>  I wonder. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1757.602s">As</a>  you look back on your experience being the poet laureate, what stands out for you?</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1765.103s">It's</a>  interesting because there was no blueprint. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1769.105s">Medford,</a>  in fact, didn't necessarily know how to do it, and so with some kind of background guidance, they were able to kind of pick up on the model that was in place in Somerville, who had had a poet laureate for a number of years now, and build a model <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1792.837s">But</a>  I wasn't given a lot of specific tasks. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1796.9s">So</a>  I just kind of created my own kind of way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1800.342s">And</a>  it's consisted of some inaugural poetry. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1804.826s">It's</a>  consisted of some poetry for special occasions, poetry for Juneteenth, poetry for Pride Month, and a couple of other city celebrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1817.435s">And</a>  visiting in the schools, especially during COVID, <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1822.518s">workshops</a>  for the schools, virtual workshops for the schools.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1826.984s">How</a>  did the students receive you?</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1830.169s">We've</a>  always had a love relationship, not a love-hate relationship. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1835.816s">They're</a>  pretty fascinated. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1838.88s">by</a>  poetry. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1840.502s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1841.924s">So</a>  I think that Vijaya's task will be to kind of maybe look at some of the things that I've done and then kind of build on that model so that every couple of years as a new poet laureate comes in, <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1856.744s">there'll</a>  be more and more layers to what the city's expectations and what the possibilities would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1864.93s">Because</a>  that was the other thing, without a blueprint, I don't think either of us really had a sense of what the possibilities would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1870.994s">But</a>  if you, behind the... <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1875.805s">The</a>  Andrews School, there is a, it's by the river, it's right by the river, the Mystic River is right there, and there's walking trails behind there, it's really a nice area. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1889.011s">But</a>  if you go behind the Andrews, there's actually a, <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1897.165s">there's</a>  a peace park. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1900.308s">The</a>  landscape architect calls it a Triskelion. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1905.853s">So</a>  it's a three-point maze. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1908.916s">And</a>  in the maze, the maze is constructed of cement paths with rocks guiding you through the maze. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1917.083s">And</a>  there are three points in the maze which have a piece of poetry, a piece of a poem. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1924.009s">So</a>  I wrote, I was able to write that poetry and then the other thing that it's done for me is it's made me really notorious because <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1935.434s">David</a>  Fichter, a muralist from... I know David. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1938.935s">Yeah,</a>  from Cambridge and Somerville.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1941.896s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1942.717s">He's</a>  been around a long time.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1944.477s">Yeah,</a>  a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1945.898s">So</a>  for 27 years, he's been painting two mural panels on the embankment across from the Somerville projects on Mystic Avenue that the paintings describe the life along the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1964.964s">So</a>  a couple years ago, now, well, not a couple years, a year ago, a little more than a year ago, he calls me here at the community center. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1974.431s">He</a>  says, you know, can I bring a group of kids by? <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1977.453s">I</a>  want you to talk to them about poetry and maybe do a little workshop with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1983.558s">So</a>  I said, sure, you know, come on by. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1985.139s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1986.5s">So</a>  he brings the kids by, take them to a sound installation, and they get to hear Hard by the Mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1992.925s">You</a>  know Hard by the Mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=1994.826s">And</a>  then we come to the community center, and we do the little poetry workshop, and everybody's happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2000.37s">And</a>  David takes the kids, and he goes off. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2003.212s">A</a>  couple days later, he calls me and he says, can I come back and take some pictures? <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2008.174s">So</a>  I think he wants to take some pictures of the neighborhood, you know, West Medford, interesting place. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2013.237s">We</a>  had talked about a lot of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2015.478s">So</a>  he comes, he brings his, he got a nice fancy camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2018.379s">He</a>  comes and he says, okay, well, let's go over to the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2020.76s">So</a>  I figure, okay, so I wanna take some pictures of Duggar Park, you know, the back of the community center, all kinds of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2026.363s">So</a>  he says, okay, well, you know, are you ready? <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2028.764s">And</a>  I said, ready for what? <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2029.965s">He</a>  says, I wanna take some pictures of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2032.706s">Oh,</a>  you want to take pictures of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2035.548s">Long</a>  story short, he takes the pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2037.429s">Next</a>  day, I get sketches. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2040.51s">Pretty</a>  soon, some paintings come, and I'm to be immortalized on the last two panels of the mural. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2049.655s">And</a>  it's 27 years in the making, so there are well over 50 panels. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2054.557s">Right,</a>  I'm unaware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2055.998s">Yeah,</a>  and it's 400 or 500 yards of mural.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2060.181s">Yes,</a>  I remember when I was riding by and I looked. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2064.929s">Why,</a>  that's Terry Carter. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2066.53s">Oh,</a>  my God. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2067.891s">How</a>  wonderful.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2069.312s">Yeah,</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2069.993s">It</a>  is wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2070.934s">It's</a>  like 10 to 12 feet tall and emblazoned through the front of my garment is a snippet of hired by the mystic, the poem hired by the mystic.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2083.344s">So</a>  it looks just like you.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2084.805s">It</a>  does look like me. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2085.886s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2086.526s">I'm</a>  not you know, I'm not mad at David. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2088.688s">He's</a>  a wonderful artist. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2090.589s">Yes,</a>  he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2092.108s">So,</a>  I don't, what was, what was I, what was the question?</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2095.812s">Okay,</a>  my next question is, when did Words and Music first begin?</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2101.217s">Oh,</a>  geez.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2102.779s">And</a>  how?</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2103.359s">I'll</a>  say it like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2104.4s">We're,</a>  we're into the 60s in terms of the number of shows that we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2110.086s">And</a>  you figure we do, on average, 8 to 10 shows a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2114.569s">So</a>  it's several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2120.333s">And</a>  I didn't start it. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2122.074s">I</a>  didn't do the first show. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2124.576s">A</a>  former board member and a principal at Somerville Community Access Television, she wanted to come over and do something with the community center. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2135.684s">So</a>  the first show. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2139.486s">I</a>  wasn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2141.708s">And</a>  then Bill Hager, who was the executive director at the time, he said, well, I would like for you to host this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2150.935s">And</a>  I said, OK, what the heck. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2153.657s">And</a>  the rest is history. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2155.558s">So</a>  we kind of took over the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2157.879s">Somerville</a>  Community Access Television faded away. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2162.041s">Fortunately,</a>  we have Medford Community Media running to the breach, and they've been broadcasting our show ever since. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2169.484s">So</a>  like I say, if you go through the full archive, there's probably 50 to 60 shows in the can. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2174.946s">It's</a>  very rich. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2176.247s">And</a>  we've done a bunch of good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2177.687s">We've</a>  interviewed mayors, and we've <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2182.409s">You</a>  know, we've had great discussions about, you know, public health and obviously the neighborhood, changing in the neighborhood, all kinds of different conversations, panels and individuals.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2193.514s">And</a>  you're just a wonderful, wonderful interviewer.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2196.895s">You're</a>  not doing so bad yourself.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2198.616s">Oh,</a>  thank you so much.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2200.077s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2201.417s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2202.558s">No,</a>  you're so kind and you create such a warm <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2205.939s">environment</a>  for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2207.581s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2208.422s">And</a>  it's really lovely to listen to every interview you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2212.525s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2213.246s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2213.907s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2215.168s">OK,</a>  so let's see, what are two of your most memorable interviews?</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2223.211s">I</a>  think the first interview I had with Mayor Brianna when she was running for her first mayoral stint. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2234.744s">I</a>  remember that, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2237.146s">Because</a>  it was one of the few interviews where I was actually nervous. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2241.71s">Why</a>  were you nervous? <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2243.011s">Well,</a>  you know, you know, I thought that she was going to win, you know, and I had already interviewed Stephanie.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2253.24s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2255.182s">And,</a>  you know, it's funny because her office called and they didn't demand, but it was clear that they were looking for equal time. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2262.268s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2262.468s">So</a>  we scheduled her that very month and it was right before the election in. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2268.573s">you</a>  know, I just had a sense that, you know, a change was coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2273.094s">And</a>  when I interviewed her, I had, you know, my stomach was kind of knotted up. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2277.435s">I</a>  don't think anybody knew, but I was nervous. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2280.495s">So</a>  that's that's memorable to me.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2282.636s">You</a>  never looked nervous. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2284.176s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2284.896s">And</a>  I think the other it wasn't necessarily a a a an interview. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2293.358s">It</a>  was a panel and on the panel were <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2299.685s">Let's</a>  see, I think Melanie McLaughlin was on the panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2303.188s">My</a>  sister, my older sister was on the panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2307.389s">I</a>  think Henry Malorum was on the panel, and they were talking about children with disabilities, because one of Melanie's daughters has Down syndrome, and my sister has a highly high-functioning autistic son, and Henry has an autistic son. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2325.14s">And</a>  it was a wonderful discussion, very, very rich. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2329.483s">So</a>  those kinds of conversations have always kind of been like my favorites.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2335.166s">Sometimes</a>  I think we're all on the spectrum. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2340.008s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2342.148s">Creativity</a>  runs rampant in Terry's family. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2345.789s">His</a>  wife, Teresa, is a brilliant modern dancer. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2350.191s">And</a>  his daughter is an actress, Maya. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2355.172s">We</a>  all saw her in a play recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2357.953s">It</a>  was just great. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2360.254s">And</a>  I know you, Terry, are also a painter. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2364.275s">How</a>  and when did you start painting?</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2368.757s">You</a>  know, one, Eileen, I haven't painted for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2372.458s">No?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2373.119s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2373.839s">And</a>  it's not because I don't love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2375.4s">It's</a>  just because the poetry took over. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2378.281s">Kind</a>  of like the full of my creative spectrum became, you know, driven by poetry.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2383.163s">I</a>  saw your paintings here one time when you brought them in. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2386.604s">That's</a>  why I thought you were still active.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2388.745s">No,</a>  I have I have done some some visual art stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2393.707s">But</a>  painting is a serious commitment for me, because one, I paint oils, so they take a long time to dry and cure and all of that stuff, and they're messy. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2403.27s">And</a>  two, because I consider myself very fastidious. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2409.051s">So</a>  I treat the paintings the same way I treat the poetry. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2412.472s">Every</a>  word, every color, every, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2415.693s">It's</a>  all the same to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2417.633s">So</a>  what I've decided is that I'm gonna write seven <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2420.754s">books</a>  in the brown skin series I've even got the title for the next one I'm not gonna say it and then I'm gonna put the writing aside and I'm gonna focus a little bit on visual arts great yeah I'm do some painting great so my wife wants new artwork in the house too I see and cheap</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2439.42s">At</a>  a good price, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2440.621s">Mama</a>  gets what mama wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2442.021s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2442.582s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2443.142s">So</a>  one thing Terry didn't mention is that I'm a writer, too.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2446.804s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2447.745s">But</a>  I've only written one poem in my whole life. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2451.306s">And</a>  I'm going to recite my poem now. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2453.968s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2455.028s">Sometimes</a>  the children grow like flowers. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2458.971s">Sometimes</a>  the children grow like weeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2462.733s">I</a>  like the children both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2465.814s">I</a>  help plant the seeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2468.396s">That's</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2469.304s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2470.064s">Yeah,</a>  it's beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2471.265s">Yeah,</a>  it's quite nice.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2472.466s">My</a>  one and only poem. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2474.187s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2475.307s">I</a>  used to have a column in the Medford Transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2480.01s">But</a>  as you know, the Medford Transcript has expired, like so many other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2486.813s">But</a>  anyway, I would like to ask you to recite <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2491.576s">Queen</a>  of the Village about Dorothy Elizabeth Tucker. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2495.822s">Because</a>  Dorothy Elizabeth Tucker, I met her when I moved into Medford about nine years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2503.211s">She</a>  was part of a Medford Conversations project. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2507.897s">And</a>  in my group, and we met at my house for several months, and we became friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2514.822s">And</a>  eventually, she invited, she said to me, you know, Eileen, you should come on down to the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2523.107s">And</a>  I said, oh, because I never even heard about it before then. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2526.989s">And</a>  I came down, and I met everybody, and I was hooked. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2532.012s">And</a>  I've been coming here ever since, and I'm so <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2536.653s">grateful</a>  to everybody here, because I don't think I'd have a community without the West Medford, or as much of a community as I do, without this place. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2550.61s">Go</a>  ahead, take it away.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2554.235s">Okay,</a>  so, just a quick aside, Dorothy was, she was a lioness in this community, you know, just made of different stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2573.257s">Some</a>  of that will be reflected in the piece that I'm going to read about her. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2576.759s">And</a>  she, you know, she had a wonderful life. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2579.56s">I</a>  don't think that she would be unhappy about any of the 90 plus years she spent with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2586.643s">But</a>  she was very, very inspirational as a person. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2590.864s">When</a>  she belonged to the senior club, they always do meditations to begin their meetings, and Dorothy, for the most part, would do those meditations. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2602.856s">Now,</a>  another lovely woman of the Ville, Edna Gavin, does the meditations. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2609.984s">Edna's</a>  sitting back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2611.305s">She'll</a>  be shy. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2613.007s">She's</a>  right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2613.888s">Yeah,</a>  but she does the meditations and they're equally as lovely, but it was always something inspirational that she would have to say to get the meeting started. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2624.28s">So</a>  this piece I read at her homegoing celebration. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2629.245s">which</a>  was glorious and featured a second line New Orleans style jazz band marching through the streets of Medford from the church to her house. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2639.375s">It</a>  was just amazing to see and to be a part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2643.879s">So</a>  this is called The Queen of the Village. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2647.482s">We</a>  didn't always do the things you wanted us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2650.983s">We</a>  couldn't always know the things that you already knew. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2654.965s">And</a>  when we couldn't find the key to unlock every riddle, you found us each a starting place, a finish, and a middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2664.068s">You</a>  very rarely chastised us except to make us stronger. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2668.63s">You</a>  taught us each and every day to make our dreams last longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2673.093s">You</a>  taught us each our history with questions we should ponder. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2677.455s">You</a>  made us seek the mystery of what waits over yonder. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2682.217s">No</a>  one danced the way you could beyond the reach of 90, the way you let the music move you, bubbling brown and shiny. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2691.662s">Here</a>  among the many friends you touched each and every day, no one dares deny the love you shared along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2699.611s">The</a>  truth that you reveal with every poem and story reminds us how this neighborhood was graced by God's own glory. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2708.22s">You</a>  wanted nothing better than for each to find some peace and prayed with us to find the ways for anger just to cease. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2716.966s">You'd</a>  pray sometimes for God's great might. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2720.488s">You'd</a>  meditate for special insight. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2723.39s">You'd</a>  say a little pleasing rhyme. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2725.252s">Perhaps</a>  you'd sing a song. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2727.233s">You'd</a>  lead us in a rhythmic chant and shepherd us along. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2731.656s">You</a>  gave yourself so freely to the center and the church. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2736.138s">We</a>  knew just where to find you, we seldom had to search. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2740.0s">This</a>  place we call the ville shall ever be in your great debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2744.843s">It's</a>  something that we know we must repay and not forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2749.005s">You</a>  hurried at times, but you very rarely rushed. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2752.189s">You</a>  saw the rose's beauty in each petal that you touched. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2755.793s">Each</a>  friend's affection was reflected when you blushed. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2759.418s">Each</a>  baby's blessing was commended when you gushed. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2763.242s">Every</a>  heart enlightened and never a spirit crushed. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2767.796s">You</a>  loved yourself, but rightly, and not in selfish vain. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2772.099s">You</a>  loved what you created, but you didn't begrudge the pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2776.222s">You</a>  loved God's purpose in you and danced in his sweet reign. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2781.586s">You</a>  loved God's purpose for you and the queenship of your reign. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2786.365s">Your</a>  life was like a sermon, so you didn't have to preach. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2790.089s">Your</a>  walk was like a lesson that your children watched you teach. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2794.114s">Your</a>  praise was for all seasons well beyond what others reach. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2798.859s">Your</a>  ministry was grace and love, such kindness in your speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2804.105s">You</a>  vaulted oh so lightly over barriers of race. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2808.809s">You</a>  held your friends so tightly that each knew their special place. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2813.433s">You</a>  never let your dignity be challenged by debaters. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2817.317s">Your</a>  sharing of the trinity confounded all the haters. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2822.369s">We</a>  marvel now in your retreat at stars you kissed in passing, all the cords you braided with the threads you were amassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2831.914s">Now</a>  we know the tapestry is fine beyond surpassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2836.176s">Now</a>  we see you strut beyond all demons and trespassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2841.283s">Few</a>  have run this marathon as gracefully as you. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2845.544s">Few</a>  have been so loving, so forgiving, and so true. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2849.886s">Few</a>  have weathered all the seasons that your life has seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2854.127s">Now</a>  they understand the reason why we call you queen. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2858.869s">You</a>  learned to be alone, but never ever were you lonely. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2862.273s">You</a>  couldn't be distracted by the trickster or the phony. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2866.077s">You</a>  went before your children when the road was rough and stony. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2870.782s">In</a>  every confrontation, you revealed your testimony. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2875.595s">We'll</a>  try our best to dance to our own song as memories prevail. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2881.541s">We'll</a>  try our best to move to every lyric and detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2885.104s">We'll</a>  recollect the harmony you taught with your travail and love each day we spent with you along life's winding trail. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2894.193s">We'll</a>  do our best to get back up, even if we fall, and listen to your spirit's voice every time you call. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2903.196s">We'll</a>  learn the waltz of unity you choreograph for all, and then we'll dance together at Queen Dorothy Tucker's Ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2912.298s">Yes,</a>  then we'll dance together at Queen Dorothy Tucker's Ball.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2921.522s">Just</a>  wonderful, just wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2923.903s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2924.943s">So</a>  today, many of us went to a funeral in Dorchester for Dottie Walker, who passed last Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2932.766s">And</a>  I wonder if you plan to write a poem about Dottie.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2938.072s">You</a>  know, it's funny, Dottie was a good friend of mine, and I knew her children pretty well, especially some of the kids on the Mumford side of her family, as well as Edwin and <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2955.551s">And</a>  Chris Walker, who became her stepchildren when she married Edwin Sr. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2962.299s">Chris</a>  and Taji, I mean Taji and John, her Mumford children, were actually deacons with me at my church in Stoughton. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2971.127s">So</a>  it's very possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2972.748s">Dottie</a>  was funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2975.028s">She</a>  made people laugh. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2977.709s">I</a>  think that was one of her chief gifts. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2981.03s">She</a>  was a very humorous woman. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2983.87s">So</a>  maybe if the spirit of laughter gets a hold of me sometimes, I'll try something.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=2991.212s">And</a>  Dottie was so loving, so loving, and they had a slideshow of photographs of her from when she was a child, and she just always had the most beautiful, happy look on her face. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=3006.243s">I</a>  wish I could be that happy all the time.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=3009.574s">Well,</a>  you know, sometimes if you and Dottie stood next to each other, you couldn't tell whether you were sisters or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=3017.276s">Oh,</a>  really?</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=3018.157s">We</a>  had a good time together. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=3019.717s">We</a>  laughed a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=3021.058s">And</a>  I will miss her. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=3023.558s">I've</a>  spent a lot of time this past week thinking about her. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=3027.72s">It</a>  just seems incredible that we won't hear her voice, the sound of her laughter, see her walking in the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=3035.902s">Yeah,</a>  it's so sad.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=3037.924s">But</a>  her spirit is in this place. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=3041.046s">And</a>  it's the beauty of the community center is, I mean, you can look at the 28 portraits that we have in the West Medford Elder Photo Project, and you can tell that the spirit of all of these people infuses the ground we're on right now.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=3057.919s">Absolutely,</a>  absolutely.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=3059.941s">So</a>  Eileen, thank you so much for bringing your thoughtful questions, your literary curiosity, and your tenacious engagement in this community for turning the tables on me, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=3073.074s">And</a>  thanks for being willing to come off the bench this evening and flip the script. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=3078.88s">And</a>  to everyone watching, thanks so much for your intendedness and your interest in our discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=3085.303s">Get</a>  ready for something very special on the musical side of the coin right after we take a break to reset our stage and share some WMCC announcements. <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=3096.547s">So</a>  there's beverages and some snacks in the back, so please, we'll be right back.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/no3-vynR2mA&t=3103.009s">And</a>  buy some books.</p>
