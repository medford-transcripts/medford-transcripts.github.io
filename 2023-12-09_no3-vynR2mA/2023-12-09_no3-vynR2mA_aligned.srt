1
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:38,482
do do

2
00:04:09,022 --> 00:04:12,486
Hey Terry, you know why Jews have long arms and short necks?

3
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:15,350
No, I don't.

4
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,952
See, see, that's just stupid.

5
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:28,799
Good evening, friends and neighbors.

6
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:35,262
My name is Terry E. Cotter, and I direct elder services at our beloved West Medford Community Center.

7
00:04:35,802 --> 00:04:46,627
Welcome to another live monthly presentation of First Friday's Words in Music, one of our official favorite events at WMCC.

8
00:04:47,307 --> 00:04:48,128
It's December.

9
00:04:49,028 --> 00:04:53,871
a traditional time of hope and faith and light for people all over the world.

10
00:04:54,491 --> 00:05:00,374
Despite the fact that it's a bit cold outside, we're warm and toasty in the building.

11
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:11,720
Thanks to a generous grant from the Medford Arts Council, a member of the Massachusetts Cultural Council, we are ready to celebrate the season at 111 Arlington Street.

12
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:19,623
We are, of course, still trying to be mindful of local health requirements and concerns, so masking is welcomed but not required.

13
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:30,588
On the whole this year, we've had many months of sponsoring live programming here at the WMCC and all over the city of Medford as well.

14
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:33,210
Please be courteous to your neighbors as we move forward.

15
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:50,440
Through the evening, we are appreciating the media work put in by Kevin Harrington and Medford Community Media for guiding us as we broadcast to you via Medford Community Media channels 9 for Comcast and 47 for Verizon.

16
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:55,803
If you're out there watching on your electronic devices, welcome to the show.

17
00:05:56,984 --> 00:06:03,771
So tonight's conversation is taking place as a true departure from what we usually do on First Fridays.

18
00:06:04,332 --> 00:06:11,159
So I'm going to introduce my partner in crime for the evening, the community center's own Eileen Lerner.

19
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:12,220
Eileen?

20
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:21,343
Eileen is a relatively new WMCC board member, but she's no stranger to many who are here on a regular basis.

21
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:29,344
She's been a Medford resident for many years, and an active and engaged member of the West Medford Senior Club.

22
00:06:29,364 --> 00:06:36,186
Eileen is also a longtime human rights activist, a journalist, and a former teacher.

23
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:41,087
She speaks her mind, and tonight what we're gonna do is let her.

24
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:44,110
Eileen, what's on your mind this evening?

25
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:48,216
No, I'm taking this one.

26
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:55,286
What's on my mind is I'm the interviewer and you are the interviewee.

27
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:57,630
So let's change chairs.

28
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,010
Okay, so, wow, this is so much fun.

29
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,957
I get to ask Terry questions, you know.

30
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,981
and questions that I've always thought about.

31
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:34,702
Okay, but first I have to read his biography.

32
00:07:35,202 --> 00:07:35,582
Okay.

33
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:44,044
Terry E. Carter is a gifted writer, poet, and speaker who has been writing and developing his craft for decades.

34
00:07:44,885 --> 00:07:52,227
He is a classically trained poet with literary influences that range from Shakespeare to the Harlem Renaissance.

35
00:07:53,127 --> 00:08:02,692
Terry is a sought-after poet and presenter on a variety of topics related to black history, faith, and contemporary culture.

36
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:16,639
He has published six volumes of poetry, including his newly completed book, Brown Skin and the Brilliant Sun, a poet's opus released

37
00:08:18,228 --> 00:08:19,028
in October.

38
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:30,433
Terry E. Carter was named the inaugural Poet Laureate of Medford Mass in the summer of 2021 and completed his two-year term at the end of June.

39
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:37,576
Terry is an ordained deacon and arts minister at Jubilee Christian Church of Stoughton.

40
00:08:38,716 --> 00:08:40,477
He directs elder services

41
00:08:41,474 --> 00:08:53,879
and special programs in the West Medford community, and is married to Teresa Carter, an ordained pastor and liturgical dance leader.

42
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:58,621
So, well, I have my own, so you have yours, okay.

43
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:07,853
So Terry, many of us know that you were introduced to poetry in Medford High School by a really excellent teacher.

44
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:15,363
But I've always wondered, what was it about poetry rather than other forms of writing

45
00:09:16,004 --> 00:09:19,025
For example, fiction, nonfiction, journalism.

46
00:09:19,405 --> 00:09:26,486
What was it about poetry that grabbed you and made it become your genre of choice?

47
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:28,926
That's a really good question.

48
00:09:29,346 --> 00:09:38,048
Well, as you mentioned, I was indeed introduced to poetry at Medford High School, freshman or sophomore year.

49
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:44,709
I had an English teacher by the name of Eleanor Kookavidis, beautiful Greek lady.

50
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:51,291
And she gave me a little volume of Langston Hughes's poetry, and I was off and running.

51
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:53,151
Now, I always liked to read.

52
00:09:54,372 --> 00:09:59,673
Growing up as a kid, I was a comic book reader, had a big collection of comic books.

53
00:10:00,854 --> 00:10:05,635
So there definitely were other genres of writing that I was interested in.

54
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:12,317
And I had kind of started writing some little short stories and things of my own.

55
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:18,099
But when the poetry bug grabbed me, I was kind of grabbed for good.

56
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:25,903
I've had to learn how to write for professional life, and I've written all kinds of things.

57
00:10:25,943 --> 00:10:28,664
And then when I went to graduate school at BU,

58
00:10:29,644 --> 00:10:38,650
obviously the writing came back into play because Mass Comm, one of the tracks was broadcast journalism.

59
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:46,516
And I was in that track, so I had to refine my writing for the news media, et cetera, and so forth.

60
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:49,658
But I didn't go down that road professionally.

61
00:10:50,638 --> 00:10:52,960
But writing has always been something that has

62
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:58,834
stood me in good stead, I would say, in my professional life.

63
00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:04,276
But the poetry is the thing that really, really kind of lights my fire, so to speak.

64
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,156
Yes, I hear you.

65
00:11:05,176 --> 00:11:05,256
Yeah.

66
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:06,817
OK.

67
00:11:07,277 --> 00:11:11,198
What was the subject of the very first poem you ever wrote?

68
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:12,538
Wow.

69
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:18,340
And listen, you know, everybody's got a roses are red, violets are blue poem in them somewhere.

70
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:24,462
So I have to assume that I probably wrote some little ditties when I was trying to get up.

71
00:11:24,722 --> 00:11:32,387
No, well, you know, I tried to unremember a lot of stuff that would get me in trouble with my current relationships.

72
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:33,147
Oh, OK.

73
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:39,631
So if I wrote another poem, if I wrote a poem to another woman earlier in my life, I'm trying not to remember that.

74
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:40,511
I hear you.

75
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:42,212
I don't want to throw that up in my wife's face.

76
00:11:42,232 --> 00:11:43,293
That was a wise choice.

77
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:43,533
Yeah.

78
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:47,816
But the first serious poem, serious poems I'll say,

79
00:11:48,656 --> 00:11:57,381
I wrote this really scathing indictment of, and this is pre-hip-hop, pre-rap, of

80
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:00,586
Watergate.

81
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:10,988
And I remember the first couple lines were, listen, my children, and you shall hear of the Watergate big political smear.

82
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:14,349
And then it went on and on and on.

83
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:19,410
So Nixon and Haldeman and Ehrlichman and Dean.

84
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,431
And you rhymed all those?

85
00:12:21,471 --> 00:12:22,331
Yeah, I rhymed all those.

86
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:22,951
Yeah.

87
00:12:23,151 --> 00:12:27,252
In the White House mystery mischief machine, I'm sure that was a piece of it.

88
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:36,196
So that was pretty serious, but the one that I remember best was a poem called All My Heroes are Black Men.

89
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:46,180
And I wrote that as a paean to growing up and then finally discovering the richness of black history.

90
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,241
And I wrote about all of it.

91
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:50,922
in that poem.

92
00:12:50,982 --> 00:12:59,652
And that was one of the poems that was kind of the framework for my first book, Brown Skin and the Bread of Life, A Poet's Journey.

93
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:01,975
How old were you at that time?

94
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:12,563
I wrote that poem years and years and years before I actually published the book, so I have to, I think I was probably about 18, 19.

95
00:13:13,163 --> 00:13:16,224
Yeah, I think I was in college when I wrote that.

96
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:16,625
Wow.

97
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:16,945
Yeah.

98
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,686
And when did you publish your very first book?

99
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:23,307
That's a good, it's another good question.

100
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:25,188
It's an interesting story because

101
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:40,279
I was... 2009, I was working for a career development organization for high-talent students of color called En-ROADS, a national organization.

102
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:46,842
And what we did is we would recruit the students, go to the different schools and grab the students,

103
00:13:47,462 --> 00:13:56,227
And then we would put them through a training regimen, you know, and teaching them everything from professional etiquette to dressing for business, all of that.

104
00:13:56,788 --> 00:14:04,933
And part and parcel to that was finding them really high-grade internships in Fortune 500 companies.

105
00:14:05,253 --> 00:14:06,734
And I had a portfolio of companies.

106
00:14:06,774 --> 00:14:07,994
I had Bleach, I had...

107
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:16,284
Liberty Mutual, MetLife, a lot of insurance firms, that was my silo.

108
00:14:17,246 --> 00:14:27,218
So I loved that job, I was at that job for almost 11 years and they had this big organizational shake-up

109
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:31,121
and a lot of folks lost their jobs, and I was part of a lot of folks.

110
00:14:32,402 --> 00:14:40,346
So that year, there's an old saying that when God closes a door, he opens a window.

111
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:41,827
Mama always said that.

112
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:42,828
Yeah, absolutely.

113
00:14:42,888 --> 00:14:48,711
So what happened was I was trying to figure out how I was going to fill my time, and two things happened.

114
00:14:49,231 --> 00:14:52,533
I wrote my first book, I think I published in 2010, and then

115
00:14:57,734 --> 00:15:05,283
roughly around the same time, maybe a little bit after, I got invited to take the job as director of elder services here at the community center.

116
00:15:05,984 --> 00:15:07,265
And how did that come about?

117
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:10,769
One of my good friends,

118
00:15:12,931 --> 00:15:14,292
Calvin Lindsey Jr.

119
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:25,321
was actually the President of the Board of Directors at the time, and he said, you know, Terry, we just, we're gonna lose our Director of Elder Services for a couple different reasons.

120
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:25,681
Why?

121
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:28,343
You think it might be something you'd be interested in.

122
00:15:28,383 --> 00:15:29,224
I wasn't working.

123
00:15:29,684 --> 00:15:36,790
He said, it's just part-time, but, you know, you get to be in Medford more often, you get to hang out with your people.

124
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,911
Because I was in Randolph.

125
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:40,992
My wife and I had relocated to Randolph.

126
00:15:41,032 --> 00:15:42,933
So I took the job.

127
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:55,761
So, as someone who was born and bred in West Medford, what led you to move out of your beloved community and eventually leading you and your family to move to Randolph?

128
00:15:57,284 --> 00:15:58,345
We got priced out.

129
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,690
I'm going to be perfectly plain with you.

130
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,695
Well, there were two things, two mitigating factors.

131
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:11,602
The first was my wife was actually working for a city department in Boston.

132
00:16:12,803 --> 00:16:19,929
and she was six months away from being grandfathered when they pressed the residency requirement.

133
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:26,474
So we had to go into Boston, or else she would have lost her job.

134
00:16:27,715 --> 00:16:39,865
But we moved into Boston, we got an apartment in Dorchester, nice, enjoyed it, but we were also thinking about buying, so we started looking a little bit, and we looked at Medford, and we couldn't touch Medford.

135
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:45,071
It was just, you know, couldn't do it.

136
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,392
Prohibitively expensive.

137
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:47,393
Prohibitively expensive.

138
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:49,616
And gotten more so every year.

139
00:16:49,636 --> 00:16:59,387
Yeah, so we stayed in Boston in two different apartments in Dorchester and then a stint of time with my mother-in-law as well.

140
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:02,911
for close to 16 years.

141
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:14,965
And then we said this is crazy, especially because the area of Dorchester that we were in, this is the second apartment, had gotten pretty gamey.

142
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:18,329
There was a lot of shootings, there was a lot of crazy stuff going on.

143
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:24,611
In the street that we lived on, at the top of the street, there were a couple of brownstones.

144
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:30,932
And there was all manner of scurrilous activity taking place in those brownstones.

145
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:33,713
I mean, all kinds of activity.

146
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:36,294
And the police were up and down the street all the time.

147
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:37,194
So we just finally.

148
00:17:37,654 --> 00:17:40,417
We got war down, and we started looking again.

149
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:49,826
We looked south, and Randolph ended up being the community that we settled on, and we were able to buy a really nice house in Randolph.

150
00:17:49,846 --> 00:17:50,487
It is pretty.

151
00:17:51,047 --> 00:17:52,309
My son used to live there.

152
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:52,869
Was that right?

153
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:57,414
Conrad lived there when his kids were young, so I'm familiar with Randolph.

154
00:17:57,434 --> 00:17:58,255
Yeah, yeah.

155
00:17:58,355 --> 00:18:01,017
So I'm curious about

156
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:06,622
What are the messages that you want people to get from your poetry?

157
00:18:06,682 --> 00:18:09,003
What are you trying to communicate to people?

158
00:18:11,686 --> 00:18:15,608
I don't know if we got time for me to tell you all of it, but I'll definitely tell you some of it.

159
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:16,929
So why don't we do it like this?

160
00:18:18,591 --> 00:18:22,874
Let me tell you a little bit about it, and then I'll just read a couple pieces.

161
00:18:22,954 --> 00:18:25,196
And that way, folks will get a bit of an idea.

162
00:18:25,216 --> 00:18:26,597
I think that's a good idea.

163
00:18:26,697 --> 00:18:27,017
OK.

164
00:18:27,157 --> 00:18:27,658
OK, good.

165
00:18:31,374 --> 00:18:42,565
I was very much faith-driven when I wrote my first book, Brown Skin and the Bread of Life, the bread of life being Jesus Christ, you know, biblically.

166
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:50,752
But I was also driven by a desire to connect with history, you know, African American history in particular.

167
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:55,138
I was driven by the influences of music in my life.

168
00:18:55,158 --> 00:18:58,382
I love jazz, so jazz is in there.

169
00:18:58,522 --> 00:19:04,569
I wanted to be able to write some things that I could then pass on generationally.

170
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:10,156
And I've always considered myself a storyteller.

171
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,598
So I wanted to be able to tell some stories as well.

172
00:19:14,258 --> 00:19:17,199
So I think those are the major influences.

173
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:29,483
But coming back to West Medford and being here ended up being actually a bigger influence than many of those things.

174
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:33,084
And I'll explain why when I read one of these pieces I'm going to read.

175
00:19:34,244 --> 00:19:36,585
So all of those things, all of those things.

176
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:44,689
So let me read a piece, kind of get you, kind of answer your question even a little bit more.

177
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:45,390
Okay.

178
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:53,333
Okay, so as I said, Medford, West Medford in particular became a very big influence in my writing.

179
00:19:55,014 --> 00:20:12,222
particularly because of the creeping gentrification that was taking place when I came back to the neighborhood, and how difficult it was for folks like myself who wanted to come back to Medford to be able to find a place where they could.

180
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:17,665
But I found my place here at the community center, so I'm not mad at anybody.

181
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:23,688
But I wanna talk a little bit about some of the things that I've seen, especially over the last several years.

182
00:20:24,628 --> 00:20:27,549
So this piece is called Mystic River Melancholy.

183
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:37,494
The freshly quaffed boho boys make real estate videos extolling the finer virtues of West Medford and life along the Mystic River.

184
00:20:38,594 --> 00:20:41,155
Maybe they're new money kids or Tufts grads.

185
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:44,397
They don't know the rich history of the village.

186
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:55,343
They do have a sense that this is a minor mecca for ex-city dwellers, flush with IPO cash, NFT windfalls, or Bitcoin early adoptions.

187
00:20:55,903 --> 00:21:05,269
A new gentry that wants to be landed for their dogs, and their Range Rovers, and their wine tastings, and the next generation of trust fund babies.

188
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:09,214
The would-be property princes have a target market.

189
00:21:09,695 --> 00:21:12,399
The YouTube appeal is slick and shiny.

190
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,027
Classic Americana with a side of sushi or a venti mocha latte.

191
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:20,007
They have no idea of what used to be.

192
00:21:20,627 --> 00:21:23,089
They know what the next wave wants to see.

193
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:27,491
They want to see the bikes, the hikes, and their kids on trikes.

194
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:30,513
They want to post pics that get lots of likes.

195
00:21:31,013 --> 00:21:33,955
They want to see the flowering trees and the birds and the bees.

196
00:21:34,355 --> 00:21:36,777
Their high-rise havens had none of these.

197
00:21:37,477 --> 00:21:44,201
They want to see if they can grow something green in a backyard garden beyond the green that's growing in their bulging bank accounts.

198
00:21:45,174 --> 00:21:49,041
Designer overalls and Doc Martens do not a farmer make.

199
00:21:49,682 --> 00:21:57,114
No worries, Whole Foods has gone 100% organic with a great selection of finely curated herbs and spices.

200
00:21:58,672 --> 00:22:00,533
I know this sounds like resentment.

201
00:22:01,274 --> 00:22:03,135
Resignation frequently does.

202
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:16,423
But when the private boat clubs bookend the public beach and the abutters don't want loud, unruly Dominicans descending on their hillsides for beachfront parking, well, what's a brother from the Ville to think?

203
00:22:17,944 --> 00:22:19,905
My daddy taught me how to fish here.

204
00:22:20,745 --> 00:22:28,190
Not much more than eels and sunfish in the water then, but it felt like legacy, and we were happy to have it.

205
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:36,263
They really didn't want us at their beach back then either, but we were mighty in our minority.

206
00:22:36,744 --> 00:22:43,266
We didn't want to fight folks, but the lake wasn't exactly pristine, so why begrudge it to anybody?

207
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:50,955
We could walk that half mile or ride our stingray bikes down there and feel connected to the small waves in the gentle wake.

208
00:22:51,475 --> 00:22:59,977
We could wonder about the kayakers and the canoe paddlers, the colorful sunfishers, occasional scullers, and the ubiquitous motor boaters.

209
00:23:01,017 --> 00:23:07,599
We could dream a little dream about owning a dinghy and a trawling engine and maybe making a few waves of our own.

210
00:23:08,699 --> 00:23:09,559
Don't get me wrong.

211
00:23:10,066 --> 00:23:19,869
I love the new fish ladders and the intrepid herring counters, the trout infusion, the bald eagle sightings, and the focus on environmental sustainability.

212
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:25,591
Thing is, they love it too, and they can pay for it.

213
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:30,352
1.4 mil for Queen Dorothy Elizabeth Tucker's old homestead.

214
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:33,333
It should have been a historical landmark.

215
00:23:33,753 --> 00:23:36,674
Instead, it's yet another preview of coming attractions.

216
00:23:37,893 --> 00:23:49,095
Meanwhile, the sleepy little Nubian Hamlet has released its black and brown patina to the inexorable tug of real property values and the dying off of the old guard.

217
00:23:50,016 --> 00:24:04,579
Mine is the last generation that knew about the first three streets, Arlington, Lincoln, and Jerome, that knew about the little store, the old Shiloh Baptist, and the library in the fire station.

218
00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:21,675
Mine is the last generation that knew about Charlie Booker and the Bruins, the five fighting Phillips brothers, Uncle Buddy's postal command, Doc Count's blue books, Faucina and Evelyn's beauty salon, and exactly why it's called Duggar Park.

219
00:24:22,953 --> 00:24:31,456
So many firsts, so much history, so little time to savor and to save, to preserve and to pass on.

220
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:37,858
So many departures, so few arrivals of the black and the brown and the tan.

221
00:24:38,698 --> 00:24:41,279
Meanwhile, the developers mostly have their way.

222
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,441
The Spanish day laborers tear it down and build it back up.

223
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:50,355
Like Lee Majors and the $6 million man, they have the technology.

224
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:55,118
They can make them better than they were, better, stronger, faster.

225
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:03,804
Condos and townhouses, Tony and Trendy, out with the old, in with the new, wash, rinse, and repeat.

226
00:25:04,784 --> 00:25:14,991
Meanwhile, the freshly quaffed boho boys make real estate videos, extolling the finer virtues of West Medford and life along the Mystic River.

227
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,491
Wow, Terry, that's powerful.

228
00:25:22,591 --> 00:25:26,932
I feel it, because I lived in West Cambridge for many years.

229
00:25:27,172 --> 00:25:33,094
And West Cambridge is undergoing the same change that West Medford is.

230
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:38,735
And when I talk to my neighbors, they say, oh, Eileen, nobody's here anymore.

231
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:43,817
And nobody's smiling and saying hello as people move in.

232
00:25:43,937 --> 00:25:45,597
So it's a loss.

233
00:25:45,817 --> 00:25:48,218
It's a big loss and a tragedy, really.

234
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:57,691
So I think the thing that I try to do is to make sure that I'm telling these particular stories.

235
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:03,012
Because there will come a time when there's nobody left to tell them.

236
00:26:03,592 --> 00:26:08,533
I mean, the neighborhood has changed enough so that I can read the tea leaves.

237
00:26:09,253 --> 00:26:11,014
I can see what's going on.

238
00:26:11,094 --> 00:26:15,214
So that's the second piece that I want to share.

239
00:26:15,254 --> 00:26:16,895
It's called I Came for the Stories.

240
00:26:17,195 --> 00:26:17,835
OK.

241
00:26:18,015 --> 00:26:18,255
Shoot.

242
00:26:19,575 --> 00:26:28,598
I came for the stories of how you built this place, from the entrelles, from the dregs, from the unwashed and the unwanted.

243
00:26:29,118 --> 00:26:39,622
The only piece of the city they'd let you have, but you built it with pine and pegs and poles and persistence with the beauty of duty and the substance of faith.

244
00:26:40,702 --> 00:26:57,433
I came for the stories of the heroes and the unheralded, of the legacy makers and the territory takers and the boundary shakers and the barrier breakers, the first ones to do the big thing, the bold thing, the forbidden, the unfamiliar, the courageous thing.

245
00:26:58,593 --> 00:27:04,875
I came for the stories, the ones you say for your children, and their children, and their children.

246
00:27:05,435 --> 00:27:17,638
Anansi stories, Shaka Zulu stories, Sheba stories, Hannibal stories, Toussaint stories, Sojourner stories, Malcolm, Marcus, Martin, and Medgar stories.

247
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:23,599
Epic, heroic, and tragic truth of how we came over and what we've overcome.

248
00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:38,727
I came for the stories, all of them, lost, stolen, or strayed, because history can't be real for me, can't reveal to me, can't appeal to me without showing the black and the brown and the tan.

249
00:27:39,427 --> 00:27:46,773
Whitewashing so clearly our critical race theory just tells me we are nearly erasing a past we will pay for dearly.

250
00:27:47,994 --> 00:28:16,948
I came for the stories only poets can tell, magical tales that cast a spell, living water from the griot's well, distinct drumming in a faraway bell, the seas reply in a queen conch shell, the salted air as the billows swell, an archangel triumphs, a demon fell, giants flee from where Davids dwell, lest they drown in a deepening stell, legion is vanquished and sent back to hell, the riot ends with a mournful yell, the ode is recorded,

251
00:28:17,268 --> 00:28:18,829
from District to Dell.

252
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:39,606
I came for the stories, and I will not leave as I am beseeching beyond my own reaching for all you are teaching the sermons you're preaching where black knows no bleaching of borders we're breaching and hatred is leeching and rage is screeching for love's impeaching.

253
00:28:40,446 --> 00:28:42,007
I came for the stories.

254
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:45,070
I came for the stories.

255
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:47,839
I came for the stories.

256
00:28:53,976 --> 00:28:57,417
Well, Terry, you know that I've been a big fan of yours.

257
00:28:57,957 --> 00:28:59,137
I love your poetry.

258
00:28:59,977 --> 00:29:08,280
And I was so happy in twenty twenty one when Terry became the poet, the first poet laureate of Medford.

259
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:14,721
And I wondered now there's another poet laureate Vijaya Sundaram.

260
00:29:15,301 --> 00:29:16,041
And I wonder.

261
00:29:17,602 --> 00:29:22,203
As you look back on your experience being the poet laureate, what stands out for you?

262
00:29:25,103 --> 00:29:27,644
It's interesting because there was no blueprint.

263
00:29:29,105 --> 00:29:52,197
Medford, in fact, didn't necessarily know how to do it, and so with some kind of background guidance, they were able to kind of pick up on the model that was in place in Somerville, who had had a poet laureate for a number of years now, and build a model

264
00:29:52,837 --> 00:29:56,380
But I wasn't given a lot of specific tasks.

265
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,922
So I just kind of created my own kind of way to go.

266
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:03,785
And it's consisted of some inaugural poetry.

267
00:30:04,826 --> 00:30:16,594
It's consisted of some poetry for special occasions, poetry for Juneteenth, poetry for Pride Month, and a couple of other city celebrations.

268
00:30:17,435 --> 00:30:21,618
And visiting in the schools, especially during COVID,

269
00:30:22,518 --> 00:30:25,602
workshops for the schools, virtual workshops for the schools.

270
00:30:26,984 --> 00:30:29,428
How did the students receive you?

271
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:35,235
We've always had a love relationship, not a love-hate relationship.

272
00:30:35,816 --> 00:30:38,139
They're pretty fascinated.

273
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,422
by poetry.

274
00:30:40,502 --> 00:30:41,283
Thank you.

275
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:56,304
So I think that Vijaya's task will be to kind of maybe look at some of the things that I've done and then kind of build on that model so that every couple of years as a new poet laureate comes in,

276
00:30:56,744 --> 00:31:04,469
there'll be more and more layers to what the city's expectations and what the possibilities would be.

277
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:10,934
Because that was the other thing, without a blueprint, I don't think either of us really had a sense of what the possibilities would be.

278
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,575
But if you, behind the...

279
00:31:15,805 --> 00:31:28,330
The Andrews School, there is a, it's by the river, it's right by the river, the Mystic River is right there, and there's walking trails behind there, it's really a nice area.

280
00:31:29,011 --> 00:31:34,093
But if you go behind the Andrews, there's actually a,

281
00:31:37,165 --> 00:31:40,108
there's a peace park.

282
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:45,773
The landscape architect calls it a Triskelion.

283
00:31:45,853 --> 00:31:47,675
So it's a three-point maze.

284
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:57,003
And in the maze, the maze is constructed of cement paths with rocks guiding you through the maze.

285
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:03,609
And there are three points in the maze which have a piece of poetry, a piece of a poem.

286
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:14,000
So I wrote, I was able to write that poetry and then the other thing that it's done for me is it's made me really notorious because

287
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:18,915
David Fichter, a muralist from... I know David.

288
00:32:18,935 --> 00:32:21,876
Yeah, from Cambridge and Somerville.

289
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:22,557
That's right.

290
00:32:22,717 --> 00:32:24,457
He's been around a long time.

291
00:32:24,477 --> 00:32:25,377
Yeah, a long time.

292
00:32:25,898 --> 00:32:44,144
So for 27 years, he's been painting two mural panels on the embankment across from the Somerville projects on Mystic Avenue that the paintings describe the life along the Mystic River.

293
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:54,391
So a couple years ago, now, well, not a couple years, a year ago, a little more than a year ago, he calls me here at the community center.

294
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,433
He says, you know, can I bring a group of kids by?

295
00:32:57,453 --> 00:33:03,498
I want you to talk to them about poetry and maybe do a little workshop with them.

296
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:05,099
So I said, sure, you know, come on by.

297
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:05,940
Yeah, absolutely.

298
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:12,885
So he brings the kids by, take them to a sound installation, and they get to hear Hard by the Mystic.

299
00:33:12,925 --> 00:33:14,046
You know Hard by the Mystic.

300
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:19,810
And then we come to the community center, and we do the little poetry workshop, and everybody's happy.

301
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,772
And David takes the kids, and he goes off.

302
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:27,454
A couple days later, he calls me and he says, can I come back and take some pictures?

303
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:32,276
So I think he wants to take some pictures of the neighborhood, you know, West Medford, interesting place.

304
00:33:33,237 --> 00:33:34,858
We had talked about a lot of different things.

305
00:33:35,478 --> 00:33:38,159
So he comes, he brings his, he got a nice fancy camera.

306
00:33:38,379 --> 00:33:40,720
He comes and he says, okay, well, let's go over to the park.

307
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,883
So I figure, okay, so I wanna take some pictures of Duggar Park, you know, the back of the community center, all kinds of different things.

308
00:33:46,363 --> 00:33:48,504
So he says, okay, well, you know, are you ready?

309
00:33:48,764 --> 00:33:49,825
And I said, ready for what?

310
00:33:49,965 --> 00:33:51,566
He says, I wanna take some pictures of you.

311
00:33:52,706 --> 00:33:54,807
Oh, you want to take pictures of me.

312
00:33:55,548 --> 00:33:57,389
Long story short, he takes the pictures.

313
00:33:57,429 --> 00:33:59,310
Next day, I get sketches.

314
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:09,515
Pretty soon, some paintings come, and I'm to be immortalized on the last two panels of the mural.

315
00:34:09,655 --> 00:34:14,437
And it's 27 years in the making, so there are well over 50 panels.

316
00:34:14,557 --> 00:34:15,978
Right, I'm unaware of that.

317
00:34:15,998 --> 00:34:17,939
Yeah, and it's 400 or 500 yards of mural.

318
00:34:20,181 --> 00:34:23,744
Yes, I remember when I was riding by and I looked.

319
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,390
Why, that's Terry Carter.

320
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,791
Oh, my God.

321
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:29,252
How wonderful.

322
00:34:29,312 --> 00:34:29,913
Yeah, it is.

323
00:34:29,993 --> 00:34:30,914
It is wonderful.

324
00:34:30,934 --> 00:34:42,183
It's like 10 to 12 feet tall and emblazoned through the front of my garment is a snippet of hired by the mystic, the poem hired by the mystic.

325
00:34:43,344 --> 00:34:44,725
So it looks just like you.

326
00:34:44,805 --> 00:34:45,725
It does look like me.

327
00:34:45,886 --> 00:34:46,446
Absolutely.

328
00:34:46,526 --> 00:34:48,648
I'm not you know, I'm not mad at David.

329
00:34:48,688 --> 00:34:50,529
He's a wonderful artist.

330
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,270
Yes, he is.

331
00:34:52,108 --> 00:34:55,391
So, I don't, what was, what was I, what was the question?

332
00:34:55,812 --> 00:35:01,157
Okay, my next question is, when did Words and Music first begin?

333
00:35:01,217 --> 00:35:01,878
Oh, geez.

334
00:35:02,779 --> 00:35:03,199
And how?

335
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,300
I'll say it like this.

336
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,285
We're, we're into the 60s in terms of the number of shows that we've done.

337
00:35:10,086 --> 00:35:13,929
And you figure we do, on average, 8 to 10 shows a year.

338
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:18,332
So it's several years.

339
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:21,994
And I didn't start it.

340
00:35:22,074 --> 00:35:23,455
I didn't do the first show.

341
00:35:24,576 --> 00:35:35,664
A former board member and a principal at Somerville Community Access Television, she wanted to come over and do something with the community center.

342
00:35:35,684 --> 00:35:37,385
So the first show.

343
00:35:39,486 --> 00:35:40,887
I wasn't there.

344
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:50,274
And then Bill Hager, who was the executive director at the time, he said, well, I would like for you to host this program.

345
00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:53,216
And I said, OK, what the heck.

346
00:35:53,657 --> 00:35:54,878
And the rest is history.

347
00:35:55,558 --> 00:35:57,419
So we kind of took over the show.

348
00:35:57,879 --> 00:36:01,561
Somerville Community Access Television faded away.

349
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:09,404
Fortunately, we have Medford Community Media running to the breach, and they've been broadcasting our show ever since.

350
00:36:09,484 --> 00:36:14,846
So like I say, if you go through the full archive, there's probably 50 to 60 shows in the can.

351
00:36:14,946 --> 00:36:15,986
It's very rich.

352
00:36:16,247 --> 00:36:17,647
And we've done a bunch of good stuff.

353
00:36:17,687 --> 00:36:20,788
We've interviewed mayors, and we've

354
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:33,494
You know, we've had great discussions about, you know, public health and obviously the neighborhood, changing in the neighborhood, all kinds of different conversations, panels and individuals.

355
00:36:33,514 --> 00:36:36,835
And you're just a wonderful, wonderful interviewer.

356
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:38,476
You're not doing so bad yourself.

357
00:36:38,616 --> 00:36:40,057
Oh, thank you so much.

358
00:36:40,077 --> 00:36:41,337
Thank you so much.

359
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:42,037
Very good.

360
00:36:42,558 --> 00:36:45,219
No, you're so kind and you create such a warm

361
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:47,561
environment for everybody.

362
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:48,221
Thank you.

363
00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:52,265
And it's really lovely to listen to every interview you do.

364
00:36:52,525 --> 00:36:52,946
Thank you.

365
00:36:53,246 --> 00:36:53,667
Thank you.

366
00:36:53,907 --> 00:36:54,287
Yeah.

367
00:36:55,168 --> 00:37:01,054
OK, so let's see, what are two of your most memorable interviews?

368
00:37:03,211 --> 00:37:14,704
I think the first interview I had with Mayor Brianna when she was running for her first mayoral stint.

369
00:37:14,744 --> 00:37:16,005
I remember that, yeah.

370
00:37:17,146 --> 00:37:20,810
Because it was one of the few interviews where I was actually nervous.

371
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,551
Why were you nervous?

372
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:33,220
Well, you know, you know, I thought that she was going to win, you know, and I had already interviewed Stephanie.

373
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:33,720
Yeah.

374
00:37:35,182 --> 00:37:42,248
And, you know, it's funny because her office called and they didn't demand, but it was clear that they were looking for equal time.

375
00:37:42,268 --> 00:37:42,348
Sure.

376
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:46,571
So we scheduled her that very month and it was right before the election in.

377
00:37:48,573 --> 00:37:52,334
you know, I just had a sense that, you know, a change was coming.

378
00:37:53,094 --> 00:37:57,195
And when I interviewed her, I had, you know, my stomach was kind of knotted up.

379
00:37:57,435 --> 00:38:00,195
I don't think anybody knew, but I was nervous.

380
00:38:00,495 --> 00:38:02,596
So that's that's memorable to me.

381
00:38:02,636 --> 00:38:03,816
You never looked nervous.

382
00:38:04,176 --> 00:38:04,416
Yeah.

383
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:13,338
And I think the other it wasn't necessarily a a a an interview.

384
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:18,099
It was a panel and on the panel were

385
00:38:19,685 --> 00:38:22,407
Let's see, I think Melanie McLaughlin was on the panel.

386
00:38:23,188 --> 00:38:25,770
My sister, my older sister was on the panel.

387
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:44,460
I think Henry Malorum was on the panel, and they were talking about children with disabilities, because one of Melanie's daughters has Down syndrome, and my sister has a highly high-functioning autistic son, and Henry has an autistic son.

388
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,802
And it was a wonderful discussion, very, very rich.

389
00:38:49,483 --> 00:38:54,886
So those kinds of conversations have always kind of been like my favorites.

390
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,547
Sometimes I think we're all on the spectrum.

391
00:39:00,008 --> 00:39:00,408
Yeah.

392
00:39:02,148 --> 00:39:05,449
Creativity runs rampant in Terry's family.

393
00:39:05,789 --> 00:39:09,530
His wife, Teresa, is a brilliant modern dancer.

394
00:39:10,191 --> 00:39:14,892
And his daughter is an actress, Maya.

395
00:39:15,172 --> 00:39:17,913
We all saw her in a play recently.

396
00:39:17,953 --> 00:39:19,474
It was just great.

397
00:39:20,254 --> 00:39:23,635
And I know you, Terry, are also a painter.

398
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:27,857
How and when did you start painting?

399
00:39:28,757 --> 00:39:32,318
You know, one, Eileen, I haven't painted for years.

400
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:32,699
No?

401
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:33,319
No.

402
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,360
And it's not because I don't love it.

403
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,380
It's just because the poetry took over.

404
00:39:38,281 --> 00:39:43,003
Kind of like the full of my creative spectrum became, you know, driven by poetry.

405
00:39:43,163 --> 00:39:46,584
I saw your paintings here one time when you brought them in.

406
00:39:46,604 --> 00:39:48,685
That's why I thought you were still active.

407
00:39:48,745 --> 00:39:53,107
No, I have I have done some some visual art stuff.

408
00:39:53,707 --> 00:40:02,569
But painting is a serious commitment for me, because one, I paint oils, so they take a long time to dry and cure and all of that stuff, and they're messy.

409
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:08,651
And two, because I consider myself very fastidious.

410
00:40:09,051 --> 00:40:12,012
So I treat the paintings the same way I treat the poetry.

411
00:40:12,472 --> 00:40:15,093
Every word, every color, every, you know.

412
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:17,073
It's all the same to me.

413
00:40:17,633 --> 00:40:20,414
So what I've decided is that I'm gonna write seven

414
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:38,027
books in the brown skin series I've even got the title for the next one I'm not gonna say it and then I'm gonna put the writing aside and I'm gonna focus a little bit on visual arts great yeah I'm do some painting great so my wife wants new artwork in the house too I see and cheap

415
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,601
At a good price, right?

416
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:41,941
Mama gets what mama wants.

417
00:40:42,021 --> 00:40:42,302
Yeah.

418
00:40:42,582 --> 00:40:42,842
OK.

419
00:40:43,142 --> 00:40:46,624
So one thing Terry didn't mention is that I'm a writer, too.

420
00:40:46,804 --> 00:40:47,444
Absolutely.

421
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:51,186
But I've only written one poem in my whole life.

422
00:40:51,306 --> 00:40:53,027
And I'm going to recite my poem now.

423
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:54,508
OK.

424
00:40:55,028 --> 00:40:58,010
Sometimes the children grow like flowers.

425
00:40:58,971 --> 00:41:01,652
Sometimes the children grow like weeds.

426
00:41:02,733 --> 00:41:04,634
I like the children both ways.

427
00:41:05,814 --> 00:41:07,295
I help plant the seeds.

428
00:41:08,396 --> 00:41:08,696
That's it.

429
00:41:09,304 --> 00:41:09,804
Wow.

430
00:41:10,064 --> 00:41:11,245
Yeah, it's beautiful.

431
00:41:11,265 --> 00:41:12,426
Yeah, it's quite nice.

432
00:41:12,466 --> 00:41:13,586
My one and only poem.

433
00:41:14,187 --> 00:41:14,567
Yes.

434
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:19,950
I used to have a column in the Medford Transcript.

435
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:25,933
But as you know, the Medford Transcript has expired, like so many other things.

436
00:41:26,813 --> 00:41:30,856
But anyway, I would like to ask you to recite

437
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:35,341
Queen of the Village about Dorothy Elizabeth Tucker.

438
00:41:35,822 --> 00:41:42,711
Because Dorothy Elizabeth Tucker, I met her when I moved into Medford about nine years ago.

439
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:47,036
She was part of a Medford Conversations project.

440
00:41:47,897 --> 00:41:53,941
And in my group, and we met at my house for several months, and we became friends.

441
00:41:54,822 --> 00:42:03,047
And eventually, she invited, she said to me, you know, Eileen, you should come on down to the West Medford Community Center.

442
00:42:03,107 --> 00:42:06,969
And I said, oh, because I never even heard about it before then.

443
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:11,512
And I came down, and I met everybody, and I was hooked.

444
00:42:12,012 --> 00:42:15,395
And I've been coming here ever since, and I'm so

445
00:42:16,653 --> 00:42:28,928
grateful to everybody here, because I don't think I'd have a community without the West Medford, or as much of a community as I do, without this place.

446
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,951
Go ahead, take it away.

447
00:42:34,235 --> 00:42:52,076
Okay, so, just a quick aside, Dorothy was, she was a lioness in this community, you know, just made of different stuff.

448
00:42:53,257 --> 00:42:56,258
Some of that will be reflected in the piece that I'm going to read about her.

449
00:42:56,759 --> 00:42:59,360
And she, you know, she had a wonderful life.

450
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:05,802
I don't think that she would be unhappy about any of the 90 plus years she spent with us.

451
00:43:06,643 --> 00:43:10,064
But she was very, very inspirational as a person.

452
00:43:10,864 --> 00:43:22,756
When she belonged to the senior club, they always do meditations to begin their meetings, and Dorothy, for the most part, would do those meditations.

453
00:43:22,856 --> 00:43:29,964
Now, another lovely woman of the Ville, Edna Gavin, does the meditations.

454
00:43:29,984 --> 00:43:31,285
Edna's sitting back there.

455
00:43:31,305 --> 00:43:31,925
She'll be shy.

456
00:43:33,007 --> 00:43:33,868
She's right here.

457
00:43:33,888 --> 00:43:43,379
Yeah, but she does the meditations and they're equally as lovely, but it was always something inspirational that she would have to say to get the meeting started.

458
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,705
So this piece I read at her homegoing celebration.

459
00:43:49,245 --> 00:43:59,275
which was glorious and featured a second line New Orleans style jazz band marching through the streets of Medford from the church to her house.

460
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:03,298
It was just amazing to see and to be a part of.

461
00:44:03,879 --> 00:44:06,061
So this is called The Queen of the Village.

462
00:44:07,482 --> 00:44:10,243
We didn't always do the things you wanted us to do.

463
00:44:10,983 --> 00:44:14,144
We couldn't always know the things that you already knew.

464
00:44:14,965 --> 00:44:23,288
And when we couldn't find the key to unlock every riddle, you found us each a starting place, a finish, and a middle.

465
00:44:24,068 --> 00:44:28,210
You very rarely chastised us except to make us stronger.

466
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:32,532
You taught us each and every day to make our dreams last longer.

467
00:44:33,093 --> 00:44:36,935
You taught us each our history with questions we should ponder.

468
00:44:37,455 --> 00:44:41,457
You made us seek the mystery of what waits over yonder.

469
00:44:42,217 --> 00:44:51,002
No one danced the way you could beyond the reach of 90, the way you let the music move you, bubbling brown and shiny.

470
00:44:51,662 --> 00:44:58,830
Here among the many friends you touched each and every day, no one dares deny the love you shared along the way.

471
00:44:59,611 --> 00:45:07,579
The truth that you reveal with every poem and story reminds us how this neighborhood was graced by God's own glory.

472
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:16,206
You wanted nothing better than for each to find some peace and prayed with us to find the ways for anger just to cease.

473
00:45:16,966 --> 00:45:20,028
You'd pray sometimes for God's great might.

474
00:45:20,488 --> 00:45:22,970
You'd meditate for special insight.

475
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,192
You'd say a little pleasing rhyme.

476
00:45:25,252 --> 00:45:26,813
Perhaps you'd sing a song.

477
00:45:27,233 --> 00:45:30,876
You'd lead us in a rhythmic chant and shepherd us along.

478
00:45:31,656 --> 00:45:35,618
You gave yourself so freely to the center and the church.

479
00:45:36,138 --> 00:45:39,300
We knew just where to find you, we seldom had to search.

480
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,203
This place we call the ville shall ever be in your great debt.

481
00:45:44,843 --> 00:45:48,225
It's something that we know we must repay and not forget.

482
00:45:49,005 --> 00:45:51,829
You hurried at times, but you very rarely rushed.

483
00:45:52,189 --> 00:45:55,313
You saw the rose's beauty in each petal that you touched.

484
00:45:55,793 --> 00:45:58,997
Each friend's affection was reflected when you blushed.

485
00:45:59,418 --> 00:46:02,621
Each baby's blessing was commended when you gushed.

486
00:46:03,242 --> 00:46:06,726
Every heart enlightened and never a spirit crushed.

487
00:46:07,796 --> 00:46:11,619
You loved yourself, but rightly, and not in selfish vain.

488
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:15,702
You loved what you created, but you didn't begrudge the pain.

489
00:46:16,222 --> 00:46:21,065
You loved God's purpose in you and danced in his sweet reign.

490
00:46:21,586 --> 00:46:25,549
You loved God's purpose for you and the queenship of your reign.

491
00:46:26,365 --> 00:46:29,689
Your life was like a sermon, so you didn't have to preach.

492
00:46:30,089 --> 00:46:33,613
Your walk was like a lesson that your children watched you teach.

493
00:46:34,114 --> 00:46:38,339
Your praise was for all seasons well beyond what others reach.

494
00:46:38,859 --> 00:46:43,224
Your ministry was grace and love, such kindness in your speech.

495
00:46:44,105 --> 00:46:48,269
You vaulted oh so lightly over barriers of race.

496
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:52,753
You held your friends so tightly that each knew their special place.

497
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:56,856
You never let your dignity be challenged by debaters.

498
00:46:57,317 --> 00:47:00,940
Your sharing of the trinity confounded all the haters.

499
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:11,334
We marvel now in your retreat at stars you kissed in passing, all the cords you braided with the threads you were amassing.

500
00:47:11,914 --> 00:47:15,596
Now we know the tapestry is fine beyond surpassing.

501
00:47:16,176 --> 00:47:20,379
Now we see you strut beyond all demons and trespassing.

502
00:47:21,283 --> 00:47:24,944
Few have run this marathon as gracefully as you.

503
00:47:25,544 --> 00:47:29,226
Few have been so loving, so forgiving, and so true.

504
00:47:29,886 --> 00:47:33,507
Few have weathered all the seasons that your life has seen.

505
00:47:34,127 --> 00:47:37,929
Now they understand the reason why we call you queen.

506
00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:41,932
You learned to be alone, but never ever were you lonely.

507
00:47:42,273 --> 00:47:45,516
You couldn't be distracted by the trickster or the phony.

508
00:47:46,077 --> 00:47:50,221
You went before your children when the road was rough and stony.

509
00:47:50,782 --> 00:47:54,546
In every confrontation, you revealed your testimony.

510
00:47:55,595 --> 00:48:01,000
We'll try our best to dance to our own song as memories prevail.

511
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:04,584
We'll try our best to move to every lyric and detail.

512
00:48:05,104 --> 00:48:13,372
We'll recollect the harmony you taught with your travail and love each day we spent with you along life's winding trail.

513
00:48:14,193 --> 00:48:22,516
We'll do our best to get back up, even if we fall, and listen to your spirit's voice every time you call.

514
00:48:23,196 --> 00:48:31,658
We'll learn the waltz of unity you choreograph for all, and then we'll dance together at Queen Dorothy Tucker's Ball.

515
00:48:32,298 --> 00:48:38,040
Yes, then we'll dance together at Queen Dorothy Tucker's Ball.

516
00:48:41,522 --> 00:48:43,823
Just wonderful, just wonderful.

517
00:48:43,903 --> 00:48:44,423
Thank you.

518
00:48:44,943 --> 00:48:52,746
So today, many of us went to a funeral in Dorchester for Dottie Walker, who passed last Sunday.

519
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:56,927
And I wonder if you plan to write a poem about Dottie.

520
00:48:58,072 --> 00:49:13,349
You know, it's funny, Dottie was a good friend of mine, and I knew her children pretty well, especially some of the kids on the Mumford side of her family, as well as Edwin and

521
00:49:15,551 --> 00:49:20,517
And Chris Walker, who became her stepchildren when she married Edwin Sr.

522
00:49:22,299 --> 00:49:29,967
Chris and Taji, I mean Taji and John, her Mumford children, were actually deacons with me at my church in Stoughton.

523
00:49:31,127 --> 00:49:32,688
So it's very possible.

524
00:49:32,748 --> 00:49:33,928
Dottie was funny.

525
00:49:35,028 --> 00:49:37,589
She made people laugh.

526
00:49:37,709 --> 00:49:40,689
I think that was one of her chief gifts.

527
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:43,770
She was a very humorous woman.

528
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:50,972
So maybe if the spirit of laughter gets a hold of me sometimes, I'll try something.

529
00:49:51,212 --> 00:50:06,223
And Dottie was so loving, so loving, and they had a slideshow of photographs of her from when she was a child, and she just always had the most beautiful, happy look on her face.

530
00:50:06,243 --> 00:50:09,185
I wish I could be that happy all the time.

531
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:16,816
Well, you know, sometimes if you and Dottie stood next to each other, you couldn't tell whether you were sisters or not.

532
00:50:17,276 --> 00:50:17,997
Oh, really?

533
00:50:18,157 --> 00:50:19,677
We had a good time together.

534
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:20,897
We laughed a lot.

535
00:50:21,058 --> 00:50:23,518
And I will miss her.

536
00:50:23,558 --> 00:50:27,199
I've spent a lot of time this past week thinking about her.

537
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:34,622
It just seems incredible that we won't hear her voice, the sound of her laughter, see her walking in the door.

538
00:50:35,902 --> 00:50:37,623
Yeah, it's so sad.

539
00:50:37,924 --> 00:50:40,426
But her spirit is in this place.

540
00:50:41,046 --> 00:50:57,639
And it's the beauty of the community center is, I mean, you can look at the 28 portraits that we have in the West Medford Elder Photo Project, and you can tell that the spirit of all of these people infuses the ground we're on right now.

541
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,781
Absolutely, absolutely.

542
00:50:59,941 --> 00:51:12,434
So Eileen, thank you so much for bringing your thoughtful questions, your literary curiosity, and your tenacious engagement in this community for turning the tables on me, so to speak.

543
00:51:13,074 --> 00:51:18,159
And thanks for being willing to come off the bench this evening and flip the script.

544
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,622
And to everyone watching, thanks so much for your intendedness and your interest in our discussion.

545
00:51:25,303 --> 00:51:36,467
Get ready for something very special on the musical side of the coin right after we take a break to reset our stage and share some WMCC announcements.

546
00:51:36,547 --> 00:51:42,749
So there's beverages and some snacks in the back, so please, we'll be right back.

547
00:51:43,009 --> 00:51:44,110
And buy some books.

548
00:51:46,191 --> 00:51:46,571
All right.

549
00:57:19,743 --> 00:57:23,564
Hello, folks.

550
00:57:24,805 --> 00:57:27,266
We're about ready if we can get you to grab your seats.

551
00:57:29,627 --> 00:57:30,067
Okay.

552
00:57:35,476 --> 00:57:37,076
I'll talk to you afterwards.

553
00:57:37,536 --> 00:57:44,078
Yeah, thank you.

554
00:57:44,098 --> 00:57:46,978
So, okay.

555
00:57:47,939 --> 00:57:52,640
So, here are the promotionals for this evening.

556
00:57:54,160 --> 00:58:02,442
As always, elders, join us each week, Tuesday through Thursday, for a nutritious lunch and a vibrant fellowship.

557
00:58:02,502 --> 00:58:04,222
Eileen talked about it a little bit.

558
00:58:05,402 --> 00:58:07,303
Lunch is served at 12 noon.

559
00:58:07,703 --> 00:58:12,825
Call 781-483-3042 to make a reservation.

560
00:58:14,065 --> 00:58:22,288
We also want to remember to thank everyone that participated in our annual Black Vendor Fair over the holiday weekend.

561
00:58:22,988 --> 00:58:31,391
It was a great community event, and folks that bought and folks that sold were all very happy.

562
00:58:31,431 --> 00:58:33,612
Some unique stuff went out the door.

563
00:58:34,532 --> 00:58:41,695
We also want to thank everyone who contributed to the Center's coffers on Giving Tuesday last week.

564
00:58:41,735 --> 00:58:46,336
Suffice it to say, it was a very happy Tuesday for the WMCC.

565
00:58:48,297 --> 00:58:58,101
And then I also want to thank everyone who has purchased a brick in our new brick-by-brick installation.

566
00:58:58,141 --> 00:59:00,502
We already had about 90 bricks out there.

567
00:59:00,522 --> 00:59:04,484
We're gonna put about 80 more out there.

568
00:59:05,364 --> 00:59:15,809
Fully subscribed, every brick space taken, so it's gonna bring a lot of new life into that installation.

569
00:59:17,069 --> 00:59:29,975
And save the date, Monday, January 15, 2024, WMCC will once again be leading Medford's annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

570
00:59:30,035 --> 00:59:36,538
holiday observance in collaboration with the city's Office of Diversity and the Human Rights Commission.

571
00:59:36,598 --> 00:59:44,962
We hope for an even bigger celebration than last year's standing room only event here at the community center.

572
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,643
Please stay tuned for more information.

573
00:59:48,704 --> 00:59:59,148
And then finally, Zumba is back at the WMCC on Wednesday evenings for a 30-minute sprint at 545.

574
01:00:00,689 --> 01:00:05,871
So if you're so inclined and physically able, come on out and dance.

575
01:00:05,911 --> 01:00:07,192
I think it's for all levels.

576
01:00:08,292 --> 01:00:11,454
And then, finally, how can you continue to help us?

577
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:14,696
It's the end of the year, okay?

578
01:00:14,816 --> 01:00:20,440
And your tax-deductible donations can help to support the mission of the WMCC.

579
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:23,762
Partner with us in carrying this mission forward.

580
01:00:24,262 --> 01:00:29,406
Please consider making a tax-deductible donation to this vital community organization.

581
01:00:29,786 --> 01:00:32,888
You can make your donation by phone, online, or by check.

582
01:00:33,288 --> 01:00:45,057
please contact Lisa Crossman, our esteemed executive director, at 781-483-3042 for more information or to become a member.

583
01:00:46,698 --> 01:00:55,985
Okay, so now, as I like to say, it's time to turn our attention to the lyrical miracle we've engaged for this evening.

584
01:00:57,216 --> 01:01:02,840
Dr. Renee Haywood has been singing since the age of four.

585
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:08,083
She's also an educator, an author, and an ordained pastor.

586
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:20,251
Renee, a West Medford native, has recorded several gospel albums, traveled the world for ministry, and been in Christian music leadership for over 25 years.

587
01:01:22,072 --> 01:01:26,273
She is currently the worship pastor at Resurrect Church in Brockton.

588
01:01:26,293 --> 01:01:31,035
Let me just tell you a quick note about Resurrect.

589
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:38,356
Resurrect has a wonderful liturgical dance ministry, as does my church, under the leadership of my wife, Teresa.

590
01:01:38,857 --> 01:01:51,080
Right now, their worship, their liturgical worship leader, Alicia Syrian-Wells, and my wife, are on a plane heading to South Africa for a missions trip.

591
01:01:51,961 --> 01:02:01,653
to dance in celebration and praise and teaching and worship to the youth of the townships in Cape Town, South Africa.

592
01:02:02,174 --> 01:02:06,179
So we're both pretty proud right now on that account.

593
01:02:08,482 --> 01:02:15,127
Her daughter, Rayma, who is with her today, has also been singing since the tender age of four.

594
01:02:15,627 --> 01:02:19,030
She is an R&B songwriter and recording artist.

595
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:26,755
She has performed several times at the Hard Rock Cafe and debuted an original song for First Night Boston.

596
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:32,940
She is a licensed cosmetologist, and get this, following in the footsteps of her

597
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:46,749
great-great-grandmother, who is immortalized in that panel over there, Elizabeth Oliver Newton, who was a founding member of the Shiloh Baptist Church and a pillar in the West Medford community.

598
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:55,716
Rayma plans to open her own salon, continuing both Elizabeth's legacy and her own songwriting career.

599
01:02:56,396 --> 01:02:57,437
Ladies and gentlemen,

600
01:02:57,897 --> 01:03:02,985
Prepare to be warmed up well beyond the cold outside of our doors.

601
01:03:03,366 --> 01:03:07,332
First Fridays presents Renee and Rayma Haywood.

602
01:03:15,728 --> 01:03:16,529
Good evening.

603
01:03:16,629 --> 01:03:21,652
This is like mind-blowing just to be here and see the history.

604
01:03:21,792 --> 01:03:24,774
I know everyone on these walls.

605
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:26,555
So I'm so grateful.

606
01:03:26,595 --> 01:03:29,157
Thank you so much for inviting us.

607
01:03:29,517 --> 01:03:34,400
We have a few songs, and then we're going to ask for your help at the end with a Christmas song.

608
01:03:34,541 --> 01:03:37,723
So get your pipes ready for the 12 days of Christmas.

609
01:03:37,763 --> 01:03:42,446
I'm going to pass out the words, or my lovely assistant there will pass out the words later.

610
01:03:42,826 --> 01:03:44,607
But we're just going to have a good time, OK?

611
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:44,847
Amen.

612
01:03:45,428 --> 01:03:45,708
All right.

613
01:04:01,431 --> 01:04:02,592
We will not be shaken.

614
01:04:02,632 --> 01:04:05,012
We will not be moved.

615
01:04:09,926 --> 01:04:39,253
♪ For the Lord is beside us ♪ ♪ For the Lord is beside us ♪ ♪ With Him we cannot lose ♪ ♪ With Him we cannot lose ♪ ♪ For the shadows around us ♪ ♪ For the shadows around us ♪ ♪ We will fear no evil ♪ ♪ We will fear no evil ♪ ♪ We'll trust ♪ ♪ We'll trust in the Lord with our hearts and in your joy ♪ ♪ We will dwell forever ♪ ♪ Though the night ♪ ♪ Though the night may seem weary ♪

616
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:44,434
Joy is coming, joy is coming, coming, coming in the morning.

617
01:04:44,674 --> 01:04:47,796
All praise to King Jesus, all praise to King Jesus.

618
01:04:48,256 --> 01:04:52,339
I know joy, I know joy is coming.

619
01:04:52,659 --> 01:04:53,740
Yes joy is coming.

620
01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:00,032
It's okay to clap.

621
01:05:00,852 --> 01:05:04,556
We will not be shaken.

622
01:05:05,157 --> 01:05:08,600
We will not be moved.

623
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:13,064
For the Lord is beside us.

801
01:20:57,654 --> 01:21:04,116
Why do I suck myself out of seeing miracles?

802
01:21:06,017 --> 01:21:06,397
Oh.

803
01:21:07,637 --> 01:21:12,399
You are more than able.

804
01:21:14,139 --> 01:21:16,780
He is, he is, he is.

805
01:21:17,601 --> 01:21:19,041
You are more than able.

806
01:21:33,739 --> 01:21:36,240
We see it, we see it.

You are more than able.

808
01:21:41,662 --> 01:21:49,285
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?

809
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:52,206
It's easy for you.

810
01:21:56,730 --> 01:22:00,111
And now I see all that I have.

811
01:22:01,691 --> 01:22:05,292
And I've got my confidence back.

812
01:22:05,312 --> 01:22:13,273
I put my trust in the one who still does miracles.

813
01:22:13,413 --> 01:22:16,193
You do miracles.

814
01:22:16,814 --> 01:22:21,294
You are more than able.

815
01:22:21,914 --> 01:22:23,095
We see it.

816
01:22:23,535 --> 01:22:25,295
We believe it.

817
01:22:32,972 --> 01:22:33,853
Yes, you are.

You are more than able.

Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?

Can you imagine?

824
01:22:59,657 --> 01:23:03,439

Say yeah.

838
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:04,262

Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?

Anything is possible.

843
01:24:19,492 --> 01:24:20,793
We say yeah.

01:24:21,313 --> 01:24:23,575
Anything is possible.

Come on.

01:25:16,747 --> 01:25:20,851
My God, my God, I still can do it.

852
01:25:24,073 --> 01:25:28,557
You are more than able.

853
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:32,640
Oh.

854
01:25:33,981 --> 01:25:37,103
You are more than able.

855
01:25:37,123 --> 01:25:37,163

Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?

858
01:26:08,281 --> 01:26:10,283
I've come a long way.

859
01:26:13,027 --> 01:26:15,389
I've seen how you work.

860
01:26:18,150 --> 01:26:22,133
There's so much goodness and grace.

861
01:26:22,854 --> 01:26:27,477
Much more than I deserve.

862
01:26:27,517 --> 01:26:30,859
Because I know who I am.

863
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:35,622
And I can see where I'm at.

864
01:26:35,642 --> 01:26:35,682
Oh.

865
01:26:38,072 --> 01:26:41,713
We've come this far by faith.

866
01:26:43,173 --> 01:26:48,035
And I just can't turn back.

867
01:26:48,055 --> 01:26:52,656
Because he's not done with me yet.

868
01:26:54,676 --> 01:26:59,318
Because he's not done with me yet.

869
01:27:00,398 --> 01:27:03,819
There's so much more to the story.

870
01:27:05,282 --> 01:27:09,504
You're not done with me yet.

871
01:27:09,864 --> 01:27:12,485
You're not done with me yet.

872
01:27:14,466 --> 01:27:17,467
Oh, you're not done with me yet.

873
01:27:20,008 --> 01:27:23,450
There's so much more to the story.

01:27:25,009 --> 01:27:29,253
You're not done with me.

875
01:27:29,594 --> 01:27:31,095
You're not done with me.

876
01:27:31,115 --> 01:27:34,539
After this, there will be glory.

877
01:27:34,559 --> 01:27:35,980
You're not done with me.

878
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,824
After this, there will be healing.

879
01:27:39,844 --> 01:27:41,606
There's so much more to the story.

You're not done with me.

01:27:52,449 --> 01:27:59,513
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?

883
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:07,839
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?

884
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:15,023
God is more than evil.

885
01:28:17,484 --> 01:28:19,366
So much bigger than your problems.

886
01:28:21,069 --> 01:28:27,273
God is more than evil.

887
01:28:28,514 --> 01:28:30,095
We see it.

888
01:28:31,596 --> 01:28:35,858
God is more than evil.

889
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:38,560
Don't stop believing right now.

890
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:41,101
Don't quit believing right now.

891
01:28:41,742 --> 01:28:43,603
God is more than evil.

892
01:28:49,392 --> 01:28:52,518
Lord can do.

893
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:55,323
He still can do it.

894
01:28:56,004 --> 01:28:58,348
He still can do it.

895
01:28:59,591 --> 01:29:01,733
He still can do it.

896
01:29:02,594 --> 01:29:04,857
God has given you his promise.

897
01:29:05,517 --> 01:29:09,582
He still can do it.

898
01:29:10,523 --> 01:29:13,246
He is bigger than your problems.

899
01:29:13,706 --> 01:29:16,389
He is bigger than your circumstance.

900
01:29:16,709 --> 01:29:20,653
So who am I to deny?

901
01:29:21,254 --> 01:29:24,495
What the Lord will do for you.

902
01:29:25,336 --> 01:29:27,076
I can't hold him back.

903
01:29:27,416 --> 01:29:29,037
He's going to keep moving.

904
01:29:29,317 --> 01:29:31,078
He's going to keep shifting.

905
01:29:31,338 --> 01:29:33,119
He's going to keep providing.

906
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:41,342
Jehovah Jireh, who am I to deny what the Lord can do?

907
01:29:47,834 --> 01:29:48,754
There's only one name.

908
01:29:48,774 --> 01:29:51,156
There's only one name.

909
01:29:51,316 --> 01:29:55,099
where we can be saved.

910
01:29:55,239 --> 01:30:01,545
There's only one name that we worship.

911
01:30:22,916 --> 01:30:37,708
Love before I had a name.

912
01:30:37,968 --> 01:30:42,192
Was before I knew my shame.

913
01:30:47,428 --> 01:30:55,010
Oh, the lamb was slain before the earth was laid.

914
01:30:56,170 --> 01:31:00,251
What an awesome price he paid.

915
01:31:02,712 --> 01:31:08,393
And I owe it all, all to Jesus.

916
01:31:09,553 --> 01:31:13,114
Oh, every part of me.

917
01:31:15,282 --> 01:31:18,584
lying at his feet.

918
01:31:21,105 --> 01:31:36,413
I owe it all, let every breath I take rise to bring him praise, to the glory of one name.

919
01:31:48,289 --> 01:31:51,850
Jesus.

920
01:31:59,132 --> 01:32:03,553
Nail pierced hands are holding mine.

921
01:32:08,034 --> 01:32:12,575
A crown of thorns has freed my mind.

922
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:25,622
Sin cannot exhaust the grace shown on that cross.

923
01:32:26,082 --> 01:32:32,543
Mercy brought back what was lost.

924
01:32:33,203 --> 01:32:38,324
I owe it all, all to Jesus.

925
01:32:39,024 --> 01:32:43,165

Blinded eyes will one day see every loss made victory.

928
01:33:17,883 --> 01:33:23,771
There is healing in one name, one name.

929
01:33:27,108 --> 01:33:35,294
He has silenced every foe, every high thing brought down low.

930
01:33:35,874 --> 01:33:39,597
There is freedom in one

931
01:33:45,456 --> 01:33:57,786

932

Hallelujah to one name, one name.

934
01:34:20,652 --> 01:34:29,179
I'm singing about Jesus, Jesus.

935
01:34:33,677 --> 01:34:38,923
This healing is Jesus.

936
01:34:52,014 --> 01:35:05,054
We're leading on, Jesus, blinded eyes, blinded eyes will one day see every loss made victory.

937
01:35:19,706 --> 01:35:23,249
Every high thing brought down low.

938
01:35:23,850 --> 01:35:28,053
There is freedom in one name.

939
01:35:28,934 --> 01:35:30,455
One name.

940
01:35:31,196 --> 01:35:33,477
And soon everyone will know.

941
01:35:33,738 --> 01:35:36,740
And soon everyone will know.

942
01:35:37,361 --> 01:35:41,244
There still is a blessed hope.

943
01:35:42,105 --> 01:35:45,908
Our salvation's in one name.

944
01:35:50,783 --> 01:35:59,288
He will one day come again to the praises of all men.

945
01:35:59,889 --> 01:36:07,533
Hallelujah to one name, one name.

946

There is healing in one name.

951
01:37:01,167 --> 01:37:02,729
He has silenced every foe.

952
01:37:02,769 --> 01:37:05,873
He has silenced every hope.

953
01:37:05,973 --> 01:37:07,756
Every high thing broken.

954
01:37:07,876 --> 01:37:11,381
Every high thing that's down low.

955
01:37:11,421 --> 01:37:12,102
There is freedom.

956
01:37:12,122 --> 01:37:16,948
There is freedom in the name that I know.

Healing in the name of Jesus.

964
01:38:22,658 --> 01:38:27,460
So much in the name of Jesus.

965
01:38:27,820 --> 01:38:30,921
Only one name, Jesus.

966
01:38:31,782 --> 01:38:39,590
There's only one name that ends in Jesus.

967
01:38:53,902 --> 01:38:57,525

He is the answer.

He is the author of all things.

973
01:39:23,257 --> 01:39:27,920
We're going to switch to a Christmas song.

974
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:29,661
You all are familiar with this one.

975
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:49,382
would one day walk on water.

976
01:39:49,983 --> 01:39:59,048
Mary, did you know that your baby boy would save our sons and daughters?

977
01:39:59,409 --> 01:40:07,434
Did you know that your baby boy has come to make you new?

978
01:40:09,266 --> 01:40:16,931
This child that you deliver will soon deliver you.

979
01:40:17,632 --> 01:40:19,333
Mary, did you know?

980
01:40:20,197 --> 01:40:26,340
that your baby boy would give sight to a blind man?

981
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:36,026
Mary, did you know that your baby boy would calm the storms with his hand?

982
01:40:36,406 --> 01:40:45,291
Did you know that your baby boy has walked where angels stride?

983
01:40:46,031 --> 01:40:54,017
When you kiss your lip, baby, you've kissed the face of God.

984
01:40:54,557 --> 01:41:02,183
Mary, did you know what was inside of you?

985
01:41:02,263 --> 01:41:03,864
What was inside of you?

986
01:41:04,404 --> 01:41:11,189
Mary, did you know what was inside of you?

987
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:22,402
The blind will see, the deaf will hear, and the dead will live again.

988
01:41:23,042 --> 01:41:31,785
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak the praises of the Lamb.

989
01:41:32,285 --> 01:41:40,467
The blind will see, the deaf will hear, and the dead will live again.

990
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:49,502
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak, the praises of the Lamb.

991
01:41:49,902 --> 01:41:58,824
Mary, did you know that your baby boy is Lord of all creation?

992
01:41:59,184 --> 01:42:03,525
Mary, did you know that your baby boy will

993
01:42:05,485 --> 01:42:08,207
They rule the nations.

994
01:42:08,607 --> 01:42:17,693
Did you know that your baby boy is heaven's perfect lamb?

995
01:42:18,434 --> 01:42:29,021
The sleeping child you're holding is the great I Am.

996
01:42:29,041 --> 01:42:30,162
He is the great I Am.

997
01:42:32,498 --> 01:42:35,640
He is a great I Am.

998
01:42:36,961 --> 01:42:39,663
He is a great I Am.

999
01:42:40,524 --> 01:42:44,707
Even as a baby, He is a great I Am.

1000
01:42:45,388 --> 01:42:47,970
Did you know what was inside of me?

1001
01:42:48,050 --> 01:42:48,890
He is a great I Am.

1002
01:42:49,151 --> 01:42:51,492
Mary, did you know what was inside of me?

1003
01:42:51,532 --> 01:42:53,874
He is a great I Am.

1004
01:42:54,074 --> 01:42:57,437
He is a great I Am.

1005
01:42:59,978 --> 01:43:03,179
He is a great I Am.

1006
01:43:03,279 --> 01:43:04,979
He is a great I Am.

1007
01:43:05,099 --> 01:43:07,580
He is a great I Am.

1008
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:09,541
He is a great I Am.

1009
01:43:09,561 --> 01:43:12,742
He is a great I Am.

1010
01:43:12,822 --> 01:43:15,042
He is a great I Am.

1011
01:43:15,082 --> 01:43:18,283
He is a great I Am.

1012
01:43:18,383 --> 01:43:20,644
He is a great I Am.

1013
01:43:20,764 --> 01:43:24,305
He is a great I Am.

1014
01:43:30,273 --> 01:43:32,717
He is the great A.M.

1015
01:43:40,185 --> 01:43:40,785
Hallelujah.

1016
01:43:41,526 --> 01:43:42,447
Hallelujah.

1017
01:43:43,948 --> 01:43:46,569
We have one song that we want you to participate.

1018
01:43:47,370 --> 01:43:47,690
Okay.

1019
01:43:48,671 --> 01:43:51,373
How many of you know the 12 days of Christmas?

1020
01:43:52,493 --> 01:43:52,874
Okay.

1021
01:43:53,354 --> 01:44:00,859
So can I have 12 brave souls to sing a line of the song and we're giving you the words.

1022
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:02,420
Okay.

1023
01:44:04,021 --> 01:44:05,082
You don't have to be a singer.

1024
01:44:05,122 --> 01:44:05,803
We're having fun.

1025
01:44:06,123 --> 01:44:07,764
We've done this with our family.

1026
01:44:08,004 --> 01:44:09,285
We've done this with our church.

1027
01:44:11,167 --> 01:44:12,088
And it's just fun.

1028
01:44:12,488 --> 01:44:15,369
You don't have to be perfect pitch and all of that.

1029
01:44:16,770 --> 01:44:17,810
It's just fun to do.

1030
01:44:21,072 --> 01:44:22,112
Oh, we got one behind you.

1031
01:44:23,113 --> 01:44:23,613
Here we go.

1032
01:44:25,774 --> 01:44:28,216
We got 10 over there.

1033
01:44:28,296 --> 01:44:30,096
And we got one more over there.

1034
01:44:46,009 --> 01:44:47,811
Oh, we got one back there.

1035
01:44:48,712 --> 01:44:48,932
All right.

1036
01:44:49,032 --> 01:44:49,432
All right.

1037
01:44:49,452 --> 01:44:50,393
You can do two.

1038
01:45:10,483 --> 01:45:11,324
We got one behind you.

1039
01:45:11,464 --> 01:45:12,185
We've got one.

1040
01:45:13,466 --> 01:45:13,706
Okay.

1041
01:45:16,849 --> 01:45:18,511
Now your verse is highlighted.

1042
01:45:18,771 --> 01:45:19,832
Okay.

1043
01:45:20,033 --> 01:45:20,393
Okay.

1044
01:45:20,713 --> 01:45:21,134
Okay.

1045
01:45:21,794 --> 01:45:22,976
So where's our first one?

1046
01:45:25,011 --> 01:45:26,132
A portrait of the paratrooper.

1047
01:45:26,232 --> 01:45:27,093
All right, there we go.

1048
01:45:27,113 --> 01:45:27,733
Oh, that's you?

1049
01:45:27,953 --> 01:45:28,674
Yeah.

1050
01:45:28,874 --> 01:45:28,994
OK.

1051
01:45:29,034 --> 01:45:31,897
Who's doing 12 cameras from here?

1052
01:45:31,997 --> 01:45:34,579
Do we need cameras?

1053
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:35,640
You're doing it.

1054
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:35,840
No.

1055
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:37,141
I thought I was doing it.

1056
01:45:37,161 --> 01:45:37,942
Yeah, you're doing it.

1057
01:45:37,962 --> 01:45:39,203
Whatever the highlight, yeah?

1058
01:45:39,223 --> 01:45:40,764
Whatever your highlight is.

1059
01:45:40,784 --> 01:45:40,864
OK.

1060
01:45:40,884 --> 01:45:41,145
Yellow.

1061
01:45:41,185 --> 01:45:41,945
What's in yellow?

1062
01:45:42,025 --> 01:45:42,125
OK.

1063
01:45:42,185 --> 01:45:43,727
So you ready to have fun?

1064
01:45:43,767 --> 01:45:45,048
We're just going to have fun, OK?

1065
01:45:45,148 --> 01:45:49,532
And I'm going to start it in a key that I think will work with everybody, OK?

1066
01:45:54,637 --> 01:45:58,598
On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me.

1067
01:45:58,618 --> 01:46:00,879
A partridge in a pear tree.

1068
01:46:01,599 --> 01:46:02,499

And a chance to dance.

1121
01:49:05,134 --> 01:49:07,675
It's only coming on the left channel.

1122
01:49:07,755 --> 01:49:08,796
You can hear it there.

Renee and Raymond, thank you so much.

1130
01:50:39,356 --> 01:50:40,801
That was a blast.

1131
01:50:46,174 --> 01:50:54,522
So you kind of know that if you let a church boy run the program, there's going to be gospel music sooner or later.

1132
01:50:54,642 --> 01:50:56,764
So we've danced around it.

1133
01:50:56,804 --> 01:51:01,249
We've had little bits and pieces of it, but we never had a full program of it.

1134
01:51:01,449 --> 01:51:08,055
And tonight, you got the full gospel from folks that sing the full gospel.

1135
01:51:08,095 --> 01:51:08,756
Hallelujah.

1136
01:51:10,834 --> 01:51:13,255
Happy Hanukkah, absolutely, happy Hanukkah.

1137
01:51:13,655 --> 01:51:15,677
And peace in the Middle East, hallelujah.

1138
01:51:16,277 --> 01:51:23,681
So that's a wrap for this new live edition of the WMCC's Monthly Words of Music program.

1139
01:51:24,061 --> 01:51:31,064
We're so happy to be back here at the center and always visiting you in your living rooms and other household places.

1140
01:51:31,485 --> 01:51:35,227
I want to thank Eileen Lerner for allowing me to sit on

1141
01:51:36,107 --> 01:51:42,511
the passenger side for some of tonight's ride and for doing a great job steering the bus.

1142
01:51:43,372 --> 01:51:49,355
Special thanks again to Renee and Rayma Haywood for bringing musical salt and light to the table.

1143
01:51:50,096 --> 01:51:57,060
We are so happy that you accepted the call to come home and share with the community you grew up in.

1144
01:51:57,480 --> 01:52:02,964
We're so proud of both of you, to your multi-talented daughter, but

1145
01:52:03,604 --> 01:52:07,389
Dr. Renee Haywood, now that really has a nice ring to it.

1146
01:52:08,371 --> 01:52:14,279
A virtual high five to Kevin Harrington and his new associate, right?

1147
01:52:16,212 --> 01:52:21,934
from Medford Community Media for helping us to be live on the local cable and social media side.

1148
01:52:22,354 --> 01:52:29,896
Thank you all for spending another enjoyable evening seeing what the WMC has to offer.

1149
01:52:30,416 --> 01:52:36,878
If the stars are in alignment, we'll be back in January with another edition of First Friday's Words and Music.

1150
01:52:37,558 --> 01:52:43,580
Before we fade to black, here's one more reminder about what's happening next at your WMCC.
