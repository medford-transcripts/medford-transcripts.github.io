00:01:06,863 --> 00:01:08,824
[SPEAKER_12]: Present, six present, one absent.

20
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:12,326
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a quorum.

21
00:01:14,327 --> 00:01:16,288
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we all, I can just get us started.

22
00:01:16,328 --> 00:01:21,451
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a policy that was at our, submitted for our last school committee meeting.

23
00:01:22,092 --> 00:01:22,752
[SPEAKER_12]: It was page

24
00:01:23,476 --> 00:01:25,777
[SPEAKER_12]: four through seven of our agenda.

25
00:01:25,977 --> 00:01:30,598
[SPEAKER_12]: It can be found obviously in the meeting link through the calendar.

26
00:01:30,618 --> 00:01:34,259
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think we all probably have reviewed it in depth by now.

27
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:40,320
[SPEAKER_12]: So we just wanted to have that extra time to reread it and digest it, understand it.

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:50,463
[SPEAKER_12]: So I thank the members, Hayes and McLaughlin, Emma Stone for putting this forward and I'll open it up to the floor for any questions that anybody may have.

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:02:01,862
[SPEAKER_05]: or any comments or... Oh, Mira, I just had a couple of quick questions.

30
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:03,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

31
00:02:03,743 --> 00:02:04,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

32
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:05,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Once I just opened up my page.

33
00:02:07,404 --> 00:02:07,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

34
00:02:07,784 --> 00:02:08,564
[SPEAKER_05]: So, okay.

35
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:09,604
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me just see here.

36
00:02:10,365 --> 00:02:10,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

37
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:11,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait a second.

38
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:12,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my paper.

39
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:17,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I just have my note.

40
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:17,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

41
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:35,451
[SPEAKER_05]: So on page six in the paragraph, probably like I think the last the top section paragraph, I just had a question about where it says.

42
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:43,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to read it, parents, guardians, and caregivers to develop a transition plan to create some transition.

43
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:44,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK.

44
00:02:45,012 --> 00:02:45,532
[SPEAKER_05]: So here it is.

45
00:02:46,253 --> 00:02:55,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Where it says school personnel should speak with the student first before discussing a student's gender, nonconformity, or transgender status with student's parent or guardian.

46
00:02:56,038 --> 00:03:03,722
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just curious about this because where the students are under 18, wouldn't they need the parent

47
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:14,777
[SPEAKER_05]: guardian to be there, you know, while they're discussing something like that with their child, with the student.

48
00:03:15,177 --> 00:03:16,938
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was a question I had.

49
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:20,940
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that might be a question for the superintendent.

50
00:03:30,436 --> 00:03:35,219
[SPEAKER_01]: I can speak to that too if unless the superintendent wants to go first.

51
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:39,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Switching back and forth between the screen, so I apologize.

52
00:03:39,321 --> 00:03:40,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I was on the document.

53
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:41,883
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

54
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:48,326
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just was going back to read the section that you were saying, Democrats, you said page

55
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:51,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and the upper.

56
00:03:52,444 --> 00:03:54,545
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like the paragraph.

57
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:58,668
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the, I would say in the last paragraph, I'm sorry.

58
00:03:59,128 --> 00:04:09,656
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the first paragraph in on that page, but it's the second section in that first paragraph on the upper top above restroom locker room and changing facilities.

59
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:10,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

60
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:11,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

61
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:20,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe you want to speak to it, give the superintendent a couple of minutes to find that location.

62
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:21,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

63
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:29,864
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did actually make a few edits to this, which I am trying to print up now so I can read them.

64
00:04:30,405 --> 00:04:36,249
[SPEAKER_01]: But so I did realize that because I did have some questions about that from some members of the community.

65
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:42,553
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to student records, there are some specific regulations regarding age.

66
00:04:43,623 --> 00:04:48,564
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I realized it wasn't just enough to put C, Massachusetts student records regulations.

67
00:04:49,164 --> 00:05:05,048
[SPEAKER_01]: To be more specific, I am trying to, I could try to share this, but student records by regulation are, if a student is under 14, the parent is the only one who can make changes to a record.

68
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:16,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Between the ages of 14 and 17, from 14 up to, well, 14 up to 18, because once they're 18, they're an adult, and they can take total control.

69
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:23,451
[SPEAKER_01]: But between the ages of 14 and 17, a student or a parent can make changes to the record.

70
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:35,133
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once the student is 18, if they make it clear in writing that they want control of their, they want total control of their record and don't want parents to have control over it,

71
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:46,057
[SPEAKER_01]: which they have to do in writing, they can't just, it's not just automatic, they have to make it clear, then they would have the right to make any of those changes like gender markers or names.

72
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:56,926
[SPEAKER_05]: So another question that kind of goes along with it was, and I'm trying to see where I put it myself.

73
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

74
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:25,740
[SPEAKER_05]: somewhere I read, and I didn't highlight it, I should have, but somewhere I read, like, when it comes to, no, I read, sorry, it's my talk, I read somewhere, and I'm sorry, I didn't highlight it, but I read that the school personnel was going to speak with the students,

75
00:06:27,128 --> 00:06:43,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was confused like, is the school personnel going to speak with all the students in the class like, I mean, I, I was curious on that because I was thinking that wouldn't the caregivers, or the parents, or all the other students.

76
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:51,477
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, have to give consent, you know, prior to the meeting, like, you know, just, you know, a notification will go to the parents, you know, we're going to be meeting about this.

77
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:53,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want your child to be in the meeting?

78
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,341
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you know, this is what I mean, I guess, like, that came up as a question.

79
00:06:57,662 --> 00:07:05,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, it was in here in a mic, and I wish I highlighted it, but you might know where it is, Sharon, where it was in that section.

80
00:07:05,528 --> 00:07:06,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, here it is.

81
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:09,491
[SPEAKER_05]: The school shall hold a meeting with student and caregiver.

82
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:12,432
[SPEAKER_04]: of students if they're involved in the process in the case.

83
00:07:12,513 --> 00:07:22,879
[SPEAKER_04]: No, parent of transition supportive of education should speak with the student first for the same reasons school should discuss with the student.

84
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:25,640
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, maybe you could answer that question for me.

85
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I'm not really sure.

86
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:36,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw it somewhere, so I wasn't sure if it meant that there was going to be like a class discussion with all the students or did I just misread that?

87
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,132
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not clear, I'd have to see which part you're talking about.

88
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:47,675
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there was anywhere in here that meant to suggest or should have suggested that there would be a classroom meeting.

89
00:07:47,995 --> 00:08:03,762
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in general, Dessie really talks a lot about meetings with the student to talk about how, and the parent if the parent's involved too, about how they want this change to happen or how to make it clear to other

90
00:08:04,321 --> 00:08:07,863
[SPEAKER_01]: adults in the school, other students in the school about this change.

91
00:08:08,003 --> 00:08:20,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse's really trying, I think, leaves things a little open-ended in a lot of places just to really drive home the fact that the point of this is to be supportive of the student.

92
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:28,276
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the title of their webpage for this is Guidance for Massachusetts Public Schools, Creating a Safe and Supportive School Environment.

93
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:31,038
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're really talking a lot about

94
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:58,685
[SPEAKER_01]: this being student-driven in the sense that really if a student comes out at school and reveals to an adult at the school that they are transitioning or need to use a different name or that then there would be a process, which that would then be the school end kind of coming up with what their process would be, of meeting with the student talking about how they want this to look in school

95
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:03,366
[SPEAKER_01]: and how they are comfortable with this being revealed to other people.

96
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:05,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

97
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:07,867
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just had one last question.

98
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:08,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have too many.

99
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:14,990
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is really would be for like the budget in the future, it would have to be like a line item.

100
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:28,255
[SPEAKER_05]: So on page seven, when requested and when satisfied with the gender identity information provided, schools should amend the student's records, including reissuing a high school diploma and or transcript to reflect the student's current name and gender.

101
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:38,937
[SPEAKER_05]: So this might be a question for the superintendent, so I don't know what's involved with that, how easily that can be done, and what the cost associated with something like that would be.

102
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:41,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, if it's possible.

103
00:09:41,438 --> 00:09:48,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it is, but it was just a question that was asked of me, and I don't have the answer, so I wanted to bring that up.

104
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,700
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would be some budgetary consideration in the future.

105
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:53,901
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other question that was asked was,

106
00:09:54,921 --> 00:10:09,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Is, does this would you know because now the students records would be updated reissuing the diploma and or transcript, you know, and, you know, at the same time, there could have been a yearbook, you know what.

107
00:10:10,597 --> 00:10:13,999
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mention anything about a yearbook, so I said that's not mentioned here.

108
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:22,063
[SPEAKER_05]: But would that mean, because now the name or everything would be different in the yearbook, which might not match up.

109
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:36,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that a lot of times if something I've always kept around for myself is, if you lose your identification, you can use your yearbook as identification with the registry.

110
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:47,860
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just one of those things where I've kept it around because I know, oh, I can get the yearbook, you know, in case of an emergency, you know, if identification is lost.

111
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:54,547
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only happened to me once when my pocketbook was stolen and I had to get a new license.

112
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:59,652
[SPEAKER_05]: But so that was just something I was, you know, it was asked and I don't have the answer.

113
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:00,773
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm asking it here.

114
00:11:01,574 --> 00:11:01,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

115
00:11:02,074 --> 00:11:17,779
[SPEAKER_06]: So in response to several of your questions, member Pritz, for students, depending on what grade level the students are at, the principal is deeply involved.

116
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:28,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Mr. Tucci has his hand raised from the middle school level, but at the elementary, middle, and even at the high school level, the parents, families,

117
00:11:28,803 --> 00:11:38,969
[SPEAKER_06]: work closely with school administration, the nursing office, our guidance, our, you know, counseling and behavioral health, Stacey Shulman's department.

118
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:53,978
[SPEAKER_06]: So we work collaboratively with families at that point in time in terms of if we have students whose names are officially changing, that will go through registration, again, working in collaboration with the principal.

119
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,820
[SPEAKER_06]: that information will be done through the registration office.

120
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:10,566
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the official database, the child's new name would be recognized, and that's what we would have officially documented.

121
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:22,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And as the students go through the different levels, when they come to the high school again, member Hayes was just sharing what the students can do, but some of that information

122
00:12:23,753 --> 00:12:26,936
[SPEAKER_06]: the district is already aware of.

123
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:39,127
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, we do have a lot of counselors available that work with our students and work with families combined also our health services.

124
00:12:39,227 --> 00:12:43,852
[SPEAKER_06]: So our nursing department would be also deeply involved.

125
00:12:44,072 --> 00:12:46,614
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is something where depending on the age,

126
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:48,153
[SPEAKER_06]: of the student.

127
00:12:49,213 --> 00:13:02,985
[SPEAKER_06]: If it is a younger age student, elementary age, the parents are usually the ones who are expressing that desire and working collaboratively with the principals to let them know this is

128
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,741
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, how I would like my child to be addressed.

129
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:20,743
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is significant communication with the principals, with school administration, the health services department, and our counseling department, and working collaboratively with registration.

130
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:28,085
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is something that we've had to deal with, and it's been dealt with appropriately, you know, I would say.

131
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:31,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope I've responded to your question, Member Kretz.

132
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you.

133
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:35,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

134
00:13:36,374 --> 00:13:40,176
[SPEAKER_12]: So Member Hayes, I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Tucci, then Member Graham.

135
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:52,783
[SPEAKER_12]: But just so I'm clear, Member Hayes, you wanted to put that guideline on page six in the paragraph pertaining to Cathy's, or Memocrats' first question.

136
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:57,745
[SPEAKER_12]: So it outlines those, because I think you said you have some changes you want to propose.

137
00:13:58,025 --> 00:13:59,486
[SPEAKER_12]: So are you going to do those all at once?

138
00:13:59,526 --> 00:14:02,568
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we want to screen share that so we're all on the same page?

139
00:14:04,087 --> 00:14:05,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we can also do it for the second reading.

140
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:30,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, so what I, what I was going to do anywhere where it's student records, so under privacy, confidentiality, and student records, under gender markers and student records, just to add that notation that, and I think, I think what I did in the first, under privacy, confidentiality, and student records is I actually just cut and paste the law itself that explains the age ranges.

141
00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:42,993
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for gender markers and student, on student records, just added a notation that said per regulation, student records regulation 603 CMR 23-01.

142
00:14:43,473 --> 00:14:46,875
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that would be there for each one of those.

143
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:59,101
[SPEAKER_01]: So that the, the understanding is that any time a record's going to be changed, there are some more specific, there are specific age ranges when, when the parents are the only ones who can change the record.

144
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:25,542
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's just a student asking to be called something different, you know, then that's, as long as it's not being a student record change, a student can be allowed to request that if, again, there's, that's under the names and pronouns, that if they're consistently being asked to be called that, if there's consistent identification as a different gender than what they've previously been identified as, that they can,

145
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:31,533
[SPEAKER_01]: asked to be used, called by a different name, different pronouns, without having to prove anything.

146
00:15:31,553 --> 00:15:37,878
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, member, Principal Tucci, thank you, Member Hayes.

147
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,379
[SPEAKER_12]: Principal Tucci, then Member Graham.

148
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:42,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

149
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:48,486
[SPEAKER_07]: In response to a few of Member Kretz's questions, I just wanted to provide some context to as well on how I've worked with this.

150
00:15:48,526 --> 00:15:53,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I've always followed DESE regulations when determining which, if any, students or staff should be informed.

151
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:58,307
[SPEAKER_07]: that a student's gender identity is different from their assigned birth, sex.

152
00:15:59,448 --> 00:16:06,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Decisions are always made in consultation with the student, or in the case of a student 14 years or younger, with the student's parent or caregiver.

153
00:16:07,491 --> 00:16:17,556
[SPEAKER_07]: And to add on to Superintendent Edward Vincent's point, the key barometer that we use oftentimes is whether and how much sharing this information will be in the benefit of the student.

154
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:23,219
[SPEAKER_07]: And DESE does have regulations where they have kind of provide less information where

155
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:51,374
[SPEAKER_07]: If a student is 14 years young age or younger or older, if they're younger or if they're in ninth grade or above, it does kind of speak a little bit more specifically where if a student is younger than 14 or in grade eight or below, a student has to have a parent kind of part of that decision-making and the parent alone actually has the authority to decide on disclosures and on student record matters too as well.

156
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:52,835
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to provide that context.

157
00:16:53,476 --> 00:16:53,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

158
00:16:54,197 --> 00:16:56,538
[SPEAKER_12]: Very helpful, Principal Tucci, thank you.

159
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:58,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

160
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:05,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I was going to ask the same question where it was 14 or under and then 14 plus, where's that 14 sit?

161
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,727
[SPEAKER_12]: So that definitely cleared that up for me.

162
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the ninth grade or above.

163
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, eighth grade or below, or ninth grade and above.

164
00:17:14,953 --> 00:17:15,533
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, thank you.

165
00:17:15,593 --> 00:17:16,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Graham.

166
00:17:18,015 --> 00:17:30,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just a point of order, I would like somebody to pull up the policy so that as we're going through this, we can actually look at what we're talking about because as it stands, it sounds like we're all commenting on a policy we haven't seen.

167
00:17:31,848 --> 00:17:36,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some changes have been made, and I don't think that's like the.

168
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:55,460
[SPEAKER_02]: most effective way to get through this policy, but I would rather we take it section by section and field the questions and make live edits as we're going, so that at the end of this, we all know what the policy says, so that its final, its next reading can be its last.

169
00:17:56,681 --> 00:18:02,623
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we're not going to see a copy of this until the next meeting, then it's going to be really hard to accomplish that.

170
00:18:04,204 --> 00:18:05,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I just quickly clarify?

171
00:18:05,545 --> 00:18:07,065
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't make changes.

172
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:16,489
[SPEAKER_01]: I did put some edits in based on what people said to me, but with the total understanding that as we discuss it at this meeting, those edits may or may not be part of the final process.

173
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:22,952
[SPEAKER_01]: I just put in some changes just because people had, you know, things that people had mentioned that I assumed would come up.

174
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:32,676
[SPEAKER_01]: These are general questions that often come up with this type of a policy, but certainly did not mean to imply that I made changes that were final.

175
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,542
[SPEAKER_01]: So Member Hayes, do you have a- I understand, but we still can't see it.

176
00:18:37,122 --> 00:18:39,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I'm gonna just take it.

177
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:44,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I was referring, when I was looking at it, I was looking at it in our original agenda.

178
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:45,807
[SPEAKER_06]: So just give me a minute.

179
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna throw it into a clean Google Doc.

180
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:54,973
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll, I'll try to do pages four, five, six, seven, and I'll pull it up right now.

181
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,994
[SPEAKER_06]: So just give me one moment and I'll pull it up that way.

182
00:18:59,915 --> 00:19:02,277
[SPEAKER_12]: And Member Hayes, do you have- Yeah, you're on mute.

183
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:05,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.

184
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:15,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I can try to share the one where I've made some additions or, you know, based on some of the things that are, what's been said here, but other people said to me.

185
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:16,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see if I can.

186
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:17,571
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

187
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:18,371
[SPEAKER_12]: A red line version.

188
00:19:18,411 --> 00:19:24,272
[SPEAKER_12]: So then we can take it one vote at a time to vote on the amendments, potential amendments.

189
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm not able to share it.

190
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:34,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

191
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:37,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a problem.

192
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:39,608
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll pull it up in a separate doc.

193
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:41,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't have your suggestion.

194
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:46,733
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're willing to just say them again, I can do that and start writing in a different color.

195
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:48,234
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

196
00:19:48,794 --> 00:19:49,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

197
00:19:51,116 --> 00:19:51,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

198
00:19:58,782 --> 00:19:59,342
[SPEAKER_12]: You're on mute.

199
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:06,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was just going to wait for the superintendent to bring it up.

200
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:16,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I have several comments, but I think if we're going to go from the top of the policy, like section by section, I think we should just all hold our comments until we can do that.

201
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:57,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I just made it a little larger, so hopefully people can see it on the screen.

202
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, superintendent.

203
00:21:59,971 --> 00:22:12,601
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so the first section, it looks like questions are starting on page six, if you don't mind.

204
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:21,289
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll go right to... It's actually transitions.

205
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,653
[SPEAKER_12]: the transition section, but I don't see that it's outlined at the same as our agenda.

206
00:22:27,614 --> 00:22:30,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some questions on sections before that we do.

207
00:22:30,776 --> 00:22:31,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I do.

208
00:22:31,837 --> 00:22:37,381
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, there's the beginning member Graham.

209
00:22:37,421 --> 00:22:40,684
[SPEAKER_12]: So why don't you start there?

210
00:22:41,764 --> 00:22:44,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question about the definitions section.

211
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:48,129
[SPEAKER_02]: So my

212
00:22:52,957 --> 00:22:53,280
[SPEAKER_02]: My.

213
00:22:55,384 --> 00:23:24,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I would make a motion that we strike this section from the policy because as even it describes like everything, these definitions and terminology evolve constantly and instead put in the policy that the district will maintain a set of definitions in support of this policy on the Medford Public Schools website that is updated on an annual basis so that

214
00:23:24,864 --> 00:23:36,789
[SPEAKER_02]: the responsibility for like the management of that change is happening on a regular and routine basis and is not sort of trapped in policy, because it does change all the time.

215
00:23:41,571 --> 00:23:42,732
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information.

216
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:48,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin, point of information.

217
00:23:48,363 --> 00:23:48,723
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

218
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:57,211
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I just had to take an urgent phone call for a minute and step away and I didn't hear, I started to hear a proposed motion and I was just going to ask if that could be repeated, please.

219
00:23:58,294 --> 00:24:16,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, the motion is to remove the definition section from this document and instead include language that Medford Public Schools will maintain a list of definitions in support of this policy on the district website that's maintained by district personnel on an annual basis.

220
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Second, so that we don't have to keep changing the document.

221
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, okay.

222
00:24:26,938 --> 00:24:30,359
[SPEAKER_12]: It's motion has been seconded, so there's no objections.

223
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,701
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Russo, if you could call the roll on that First Amendment.

224
00:24:35,602 --> 00:24:35,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

225
00:24:36,302 --> 00:24:36,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham?

226
00:24:37,402 --> 00:24:37,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

227
00:24:39,063 --> 00:24:39,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hayes?

228
00:24:40,183 --> 00:24:40,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

229
00:24:41,804 --> 00:24:42,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Kratz?

230
00:24:42,785 --> 00:24:43,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

231
00:24:44,725 --> 00:24:45,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin?

232
00:24:46,046 --> 00:24:46,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

233
00:24:47,607 --> 00:24:48,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McStone absent.

234
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:49,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Russo?

235
00:24:49,527 --> 00:24:49,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

236
00:24:49,828 --> 00:24:50,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor Longo Kerr?

237
00:24:51,068 --> 00:24:51,308
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

238
00:24:51,328 --> 00:24:52,829
[SPEAKER_12]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

239
00:24:53,735 --> 00:24:54,803
[SPEAKER_12]: The motion passes.

240
00:24:58,658 --> 00:25:11,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, the second motion I have is that everywhere where we say parents, guardians, caregivers, all the policy work we've been doing has been trying to standardize some of the language across our policy base.

241
00:25:11,828 --> 00:25:16,451
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are using the phrase caregivers to be all encompassing.

242
00:25:16,611 --> 00:25:22,996
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would just make a motion that anywhere where we say parents, guardians, caregivers, it just be amended to say caregivers.

243
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:25,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like, again, a global policy issue.

244
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:31,861
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

245
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:32,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Roll call vote.

246
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:34,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

247
00:25:35,623 --> 00:25:35,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

248
00:25:36,983 --> 00:25:37,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hayes.

249
00:25:38,044 --> 00:25:38,264
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

250
00:25:39,325 --> 00:25:39,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Kratz.

251
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:40,445
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

252
00:25:42,386 --> 00:25:43,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McStone, absent.

253
00:25:43,447 --> 00:25:44,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Risseau, yes.

254
00:25:44,487 --> 00:25:45,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor Longo, current.

255
00:25:45,988 --> 00:25:46,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

256
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:47,669
[SPEAKER_12]: Six in the affirmative.

257
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:49,510
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I vote yes?

258
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,310
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, did I skip you?

259
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:50,811
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

260
00:25:51,031 --> 00:25:51,631
[SPEAKER_12]: That's okay.

261
00:25:52,492 --> 00:25:54,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

262
00:25:54,293 --> 00:25:55,013
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion is approved.

263
00:26:20,302 --> 00:26:30,226
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Edward Vincent to just maybe note that the, instead of we'll be deleting the definitions and we'll just put in language that the definitions can be found on our website.

264
00:26:31,447 --> 00:26:37,969
[SPEAKER_12]: And then in the rest of the document is where we would change that language to just caregivers throughout the rest of the document.

265
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:44,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Just notes for, notes to self.

266
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:46,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, member Russo.

267
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:58,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Just for my, because we're speaking and not seeing words that I'm typing into the minutes, caregivers is caregiver and then open parenthesis S, close parenthesis.

268
00:26:58,878 --> 00:27:06,943
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want to assume there's more than one, but just wanted everybody to know that's what I wrote in the motion in case there's any disagreement.

269
00:27:08,184 --> 00:27:08,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Perfect.

270
00:27:08,524 --> 00:27:09,044
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

271
00:27:11,343 --> 00:27:16,167
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Graham, did you have more questions and suggestions?

272
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Not until this point in the policy.

273
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:22,413
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the next section says is about transitions.

274
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:28,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any comments about transitions, but perhaps others do.

275
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:34,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Hayes, I think in transitions you mentioned also adding that note.

276
00:27:36,144 --> 00:27:37,826
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you want to take that motion now?

277
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:43,175
[SPEAKER_01]: For which part?

278
00:27:43,615 --> 00:28:04,490
[SPEAKER_01]: The note that I was talking about in terms of delineating the age, referring to the records, that could go either under names and pronouns, really, or the Privacy, Confidentiality, and Student Records is probably the most fitting place for it, since that's where the age ranges really apply.

279
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:22,830
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I think because member cards had questions about the second to last sentence in on page six, where it says school personnel should speak with the student first before discussing a student's gender, nonconformity or transgender status with the student's parents or guardian.

280
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:28,373
[SPEAKER_12]: So I didn't know if we wanted to make that the age requirements clear in that section, too.

281
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:34,035
[SPEAKER_01]: So the age requirements only refer to specific changes in the student record.

282
00:28:34,428 --> 00:28:37,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's where that that's part of the student records regulations.

283
00:28:37,569 --> 00:28:54,837
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no age range defined by law or by desi in terms of when parents need to be notified if a student just comes to an adult at the school and starts talking about Wanting to change their name or pronouns in usage at school.

284
00:29:06,403 --> 00:29:06,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

285
00:29:11,045 --> 00:29:13,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to find that exact location.

286
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:24,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I did share it with all members so that they can... I think it's up higher and there's a section right under the definitions called transitions.

287
00:29:26,192 --> 00:29:26,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

288
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:27,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Right there.

289
00:29:28,353 --> 00:29:30,634
[SPEAKER_06]: And in this section, can you just repeat that?

290
00:29:31,849 --> 00:29:42,535
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the second big paragraph, Dr. Edward Vinson, where it says school personnel, the second to last sentence, school, right there, school personnel should speak with the students first before it.

291
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:58,705
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe the principal, Tucci, do you have opinions on this one where, I mean, you're in the middle school, so is it, should it be different between elementary and middle or?

292
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:03,552
[SPEAKER_12]: to just apply that sense of just being broad.

293
00:30:13,776 --> 00:30:26,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Or could the comment just be in compliance with the state's regulations so that, or to specifically spell out K through H, or younger than 14 years old,

294
00:30:29,143 --> 00:30:30,483
[SPEAKER_06]: in collaboration with parents?

295
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:33,724
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually, I'm sorry to interrupt.

296
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:35,645
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually not in the regulations.

297
00:30:35,705 --> 00:30:43,147
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no regulation about, the regulation specifically refers to student records that the student cannot request.

298
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:47,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Under the age of 14, a student cannot request a change to their record.

299
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:53,369
[SPEAKER_01]: That can only be done by a parent before ninth grade or 14, whichever comes first.

300
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,970
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of speaking to the parents,

301
00:30:58,093 --> 00:31:23,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Desi actually pretty clearly talks about the fact that some students won't be comfortable, will express that they are not comfortable talking to their parents or actually afraid and leaves it open to the discretion of the professionals at the school to kind of make that call and talk about, work with the student to figure out how to tell the parents.

302
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,612
[SPEAKER_01]: In which actually I did, if I could, I did want to add

303
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:28,820
[SPEAKER_01]: because I know this is a major concern.

304
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:34,722
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know this is a major concern for a lot of people that I did want to add in there.

305
00:31:34,742 --> 00:31:39,483
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can, you had asked, I'm sorry, Mr. Tucci, did you want to speak first?

306
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:42,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I did have something I'd like to add in there, but I won't let you talk first.

307
00:31:44,585 --> 00:31:55,469
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things I was alluding to earlier was the determination of whether or not staff or students should be informed that a student's gender identity is different from their assigned birth sex or anything of that sort.

308
00:31:56,295 --> 00:32:01,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, if, if whether or not we want to put any language in about how to make that determination.

309
00:32:01,476 --> 00:32:09,677
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the things I spoke to earlier was, uh, when making that determination is whether or not it's, uh, the sharing is going to be beneficial to the students.

310
00:32:10,418 --> 00:32:19,739
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just kind of wanted to bring up that point there to see if we wanted to put any language, uh, out there about our stance on it and that for public schools.

311
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:23,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

312
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:52,162
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can just, because I've done so much reading about this, just to come in and say, in all cases, Desi keeps coming back when they talk about this to saying, work with the student to determine what they feel is best for them.

313
00:32:52,742 --> 00:33:02,764
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would honestly hesitate to put something in writing in a policy that says either way what staff has to do.

314
00:33:03,339 --> 00:33:14,802
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think really DESE is trying really hard to leave it up to the professionals at the school who clearly, they probably know this student very well.

315
00:33:14,922 --> 00:33:28,505
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is a student coming to them, it feels comfortable enough to talk to them about it, that looking at a process for working with the student to determine how do you want this to look at school for you?

316
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,383
[SPEAKER_01]: all of your teachers to know?

317
00:33:31,403 --> 00:33:33,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want all of your classmates to know?

318
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:38,128
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we bring your family into this so your family knows if they don't already know?

319
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:48,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, if the family's the one coming in or if the student's coming with their family, the team of people working on this would be including the family or the caregivers.

320
00:33:50,377 --> 00:33:57,522
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of open-endedness to DESE's guidelines and really they keep coming back to in their

321
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:09,065
[SPEAKER_01]: discussion throughout their webpage or their website for this, that it's kind of a student, it needs to be student-driven, that we need to honor what the student feels comfortable with.

322
00:34:11,186 --> 00:34:27,574
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there really needs to be, whether it's a defined process or just a generally known process of how there's a team of people that gets together with the student, maybe including a guidance counselor, an adjustment counselor, nurses, or whoever the student feels comfortable with.

323
00:34:28,171 --> 00:34:34,576
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk with a student about what they need to feel, again, that safe and supportive environment.

324
00:34:38,258 --> 00:34:38,618
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

325
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Russo, then Member Graham.

326
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:43,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

327
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:53,449
[SPEAKER_08]: In the same section here, a couple sentences up, it says, some transgender and gender nonconforming students are not openly so at home.

328
00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:10,056
[SPEAKER_08]: well, that language is a little, it's correct, but that doesn't sound very common in the US, but anyways, are not openly so at home for reasons such as safety concerns or lack of acceptance.

329
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:13,898
[SPEAKER_08]: And then another two sentences later,

330
00:35:15,207 --> 00:35:20,132
[SPEAKER_08]: For the same reason school personnel should discuss with the student how we've just been talking about that.

331
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,254
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just a little concerned here.

332
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:33,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Where does this get documented that so that each and every staff member communicating with caregivers understands the possible expectation to communicate with a student one way and

333
00:35:34,284 --> 00:35:36,726
[SPEAKER_08]: caregivers another, because that's what we're talking about here.

334
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:39,268
[SPEAKER_08]: A student comes to school, he, she, her pronouns.

335
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:43,891
[SPEAKER_08]: At home, they're he, him pronouns, which is not an unusual situation.

336
00:35:45,492 --> 00:35:48,814
[SPEAKER_08]: And it might be just the way it is and it's no big deal.

337
00:35:48,954 --> 00:35:52,857
[SPEAKER_08]: It also could be, as we said two sentences before, for safety reasons.

338
00:35:53,437 --> 00:35:55,599
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little concerned that we have to have staff

339
00:35:57,318 --> 00:35:59,279
[SPEAKER_08]: just, you know, they just have to know.

340
00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:19,572
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm just really concerned that we're putting staff in a terrible position here where every communication, they're going to have to be, you know, wait, is this, is this, you know, because lots of transgender students and adults, like you don't know they're transgender.

341
00:36:19,672 --> 00:36:21,353
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like they wear a little sign.

342
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:27,910
[SPEAKER_08]: So you get used to a student or a student comes into your school or class and you don't know they're transgender and you don't care.

343
00:36:30,052 --> 00:36:37,056
[SPEAKER_08]: But then you're gonna go write something that goes home and we have a policy expecting them to know this.

344
00:36:38,957 --> 00:36:52,286
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just really concerned that staff is going to, well, I wouldn't want to be, if I was a staff member, I would want something a little more robust.

345
00:36:53,823 --> 00:36:58,787
[SPEAKER_08]: some way to be flagged so that every time I'm writing a communication to my students, I know.

346
00:36:58,807 --> 00:37:00,949
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, this gets into the sharing thing.

347
00:37:01,549 --> 00:37:14,840
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, if a student is presenting and using she, her pronouns at school and using he, him at home, how are we expecting staff to get that right?

348
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,284
[SPEAKER_08]: And two sentences before, we're concerned about their safety.

349
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:20,465
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't have it both ways.

350
00:37:21,085 --> 00:37:23,407
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't have it where the staff doesn't find out,

351
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:29,406
[SPEAKER_08]: But then the staff also has to know to do something different at home for home communication.

352
00:37:29,466 --> 00:37:31,008
[SPEAKER_08]: So those two things are in conflict.

353
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:41,339
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't want our staff to be stuck with the guilt of screwing it up and something happens to a student.

354
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:46,125
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying this is happening in Medford, but we can all read the news.

355
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:47,546
[SPEAKER_08]: This is real stuff.

356
00:37:48,087 --> 00:38:04,522
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's our expectation for the district, for the superintendent, and for processes to make sure that when this is a situation, and I don't know how it gets determined, guidance or whoever makes this determination, that this really is

357
00:38:06,545 --> 00:38:17,187
[SPEAKER_08]: pushed out to all staff that could possibly communicate with a parent, because I'm just deeply concerned about the safety of our students and, frankly, the staff.

358
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:19,847
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I would feel really awful.

359
00:38:21,148 --> 00:38:22,528
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a question.

360
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:23,368
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have an answer.

361
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:29,629
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll go in order.

362
00:38:29,649 --> 00:38:34,470
[SPEAKER_12]: I think member Graham, member Hayes, principal Tucci, unless people want to comment on each other's.

363
00:38:37,104 --> 00:38:44,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, so my original comment was just to say, I'm fine with this section exactly as it is written.

364
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it actually needs revision.

365
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:54,879
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think to member Rousseau's point, I think what he's talking about are really implementation questions.

366
00:38:55,039 --> 00:39:02,346
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I do think what we need to do when we enact this policy is that we need to

367
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:26,384
[SPEAKER_02]: have a motion that enacts the policy and directs the administration to advise us if there are things that are needed in order to enact this policy like with integrity and fidelity and what those things are by some date certain so that we can be informed if there are things that are needed.

368
00:39:28,386 --> 00:39:38,163
[SPEAKER_02]: in support of the policy and acknowledge that if we're going to say this policy is effective immediately, that there is an implementation phase, there is an implementation period where

369
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:57,900
[SPEAKER_02]: we're implementing, which I'm fine with, but I think that's, to me, the solution to the real questions that member Rousseau is raising, which is they really are implementation questions and they're super important, but I don't wanna bog down the work on this policy with that.

370
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:08,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, I wanna pass the policy and give clear direction to the superintendent about what our expectations are so that she can then advise us what those needs are.

371
00:40:12,657 --> 00:40:15,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, member Hayes, principal Tucci, then member Rousseau.

372
00:40:18,265 --> 00:40:18,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

373
00:40:18,686 --> 00:40:20,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree with with member Graham.

374
00:40:20,428 --> 00:40:27,499
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, you know, some of that does come down to that, the implementation and the determination by the superintendent and her team.

375
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:40,043
[SPEAKER_01]: what some of these processes will look like, what will it look like to create a team that supports the student, what will it look like in terms of who we notify, who gets notified and what the student wants.

376
00:40:41,484 --> 00:40:46,105
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I would also, I was also wanted to add, I mean, at this moment, we have no policy in place.

377
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:51,026
[SPEAKER_01]: So really teachers have no idea what to do in a situation.

378
00:40:51,926 --> 00:40:53,907
[SPEAKER_01]: So at least hopefully with the policy,

379
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,765
[SPEAKER_01]: it puts something in place that we can work with.

380
00:40:57,286 --> 00:41:02,129
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not working, of course, as we've often said, policies are not written in stone.

381
00:41:02,489 --> 00:41:06,092
[SPEAKER_01]: They are there to be tweaked and changed if things aren't working.

382
00:41:07,953 --> 00:41:10,015
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I keep coming back to that.

383
00:41:10,615 --> 00:41:18,581
[SPEAKER_01]: This is taken 90% from DESE with some of the wording taken from other policies from other districts.

384
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:20,162
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know,

385
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:26,600
[SPEAKER_01]: some of this open-ended, what feels open-ended or feels kind of nebulous, is by intent.

386
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:35,867
[SPEAKER_01]: By intent to give the school system the flexibility because these are not, these are not situations where we're going to be able to make black and white rules.

387
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:43,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Because each student is going to be different in terms of what their needs are, what they want, what they feel comfortable with, and it gives the flexibility

388
00:41:44,403 --> 00:41:55,187
[SPEAKER_01]: for the school district and that the staff involved to be able to work with the student and make determinations on an individual basis, as opposed to having to follow some really strict rigid rules.

389
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,769
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Principal Tucci.

390
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:06,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Then answer a couple of members those questions.

391
00:42:06,352 --> 00:42:15,556
[SPEAKER_07]: In practice, a person like myself or guidance counselor be working with a team of teachers, if a student is, you know, saying that they would like to be using certain pronouns.

392
00:42:16,112 --> 00:42:24,020
[SPEAKER_07]: And we actually have a way in our school information system and school brains, or on the person's profile, there's a there's a section that's entitled preferred pronouns.

393
00:42:24,581 --> 00:42:36,333
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have several students, for instance, at the middle school level, that might use a preferred pronouns like they them, or, for example, and we would be utilizing those types of pronouns in working with the students.

394
00:42:37,033 --> 00:42:38,594
[SPEAKER_07]: and how we refer to the student.

395
00:42:39,195 --> 00:42:46,239
[SPEAKER_07]: And just so that we are setting our teachers up and educators up to be able to, you know, be able to respect those preferred pronouns.

396
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:52,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

397
00:42:52,724 --> 00:42:53,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Rousseau?

398
00:42:54,545 --> 00:42:54,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

399
00:42:55,466 --> 00:42:56,366
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all good to hear.

400
00:42:56,827 --> 00:43:03,111
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hope I didn't imply that there wasn't any confidence in the leadership to already be doing a lot of this stuff.

401
00:43:04,532 --> 00:43:06,453
[SPEAKER_08]: That certainly was not my intent.

402
00:43:07,242 --> 00:43:09,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I'm just going to go to the top because I have.

403
00:43:11,144 --> 00:43:13,465
[SPEAKER_08]: A long list of, uh, changes.

404
00:43:14,285 --> 00:43:14,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Little changes.

405
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:19,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and if it's okay, I will put them all together in one motion.

406
00:43:19,547 --> 00:43:25,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, unless there's somebody argues about one of them or something, and then I'll separate that one.

407
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:30,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so, uh, the in front of Denver public school should be removed.

408
00:43:34,794 --> 00:43:34,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

409
00:43:36,727 --> 00:43:43,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Next we have, there's several places where it says the Medford Public Schools and it should just be Medford Public Schools as a proper name.

410
00:43:44,312 --> 00:43:48,835
[SPEAKER_08]: We wouldn't say the Maurice.

411
00:43:49,555 --> 00:43:53,477
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm just gonna say that once and I'll include them in the list.

412
00:43:54,818 --> 00:44:04,184
[SPEAKER_08]: The next paragraph down, so I see memograms located right there, but to help create safe and supportive

413
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:09,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Environment for all students district will consistent with applicable laws and guidance take the following steps.

414
00:44:10,009 --> 00:44:10,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see any steps.

415
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:12,450
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know what that means.

416
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:17,894
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not sure if I think we should strike it.

417
00:44:18,274 --> 00:44:24,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, but it feels like that was like, like our bullying policy.

418
00:44:24,678 --> 00:44:26,219
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, you're gonna do a bunch of things.

419
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:27,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the list.

420
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Or as I said, in the bullying policy, you're gonna do a bunch of things.

421
00:44:31,342 --> 00:44:32,362
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it didn't say the list.

422
00:44:32,542 --> 00:44:33,443
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not sure.

423
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:38,832
[SPEAKER_08]: what that is supposed to mean, if anybody wants to respond.

424
00:44:41,933 --> 00:44:42,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, I can respond.

425
00:44:43,633 --> 00:44:48,075
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I know you mentioned that at the last meeting, that was one of the things you were questioning.

426
00:44:48,635 --> 00:44:55,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, if we take out the definitions, then the steps are what's under each of these sections.

427
00:44:56,118 --> 00:45:01,660
[SPEAKER_01]: The things we will do in regards to names and pronouns, the things we'll do in terms of transitions,

428
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:04,529
[SPEAKER_01]: restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities.

429
00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:13,995
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the steps that we will take to create a safe and supportive environment for our students.

430
00:45:17,678 --> 00:45:22,141
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not married to that language.

431
00:45:23,081 --> 00:45:28,345
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really change the gist of the whole thing.

432
00:45:28,385 --> 00:45:29,966
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's fine with me to change it.

433
00:45:31,749 --> 00:45:37,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, member Russo has the floor, but member McLaughlin, do you have a point of clarification?

434
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:50,113
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I was just gonna say, yeah, I mean, I was just gonna say point of, yeah, I guess clarification, I was just gonna say they are steps, you could just number them if that makes it easier, but again, I think we're just into the weeds and the minutiae here.

435
00:45:50,133 --> 00:45:53,673
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that it's the subheadings that can throw people off.

436
00:45:54,894 --> 00:45:55,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, member Russo.

437
00:45:56,874 --> 00:45:57,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

438
00:45:57,194 --> 00:46:04,158
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just going to say that, you know, this is policy and just like law everywhere, it does matter, which is why I'm saying remove the does.

439
00:46:04,478 --> 00:46:10,581
[SPEAKER_08]: The set of steps is like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, you do them in this order and you check off that you did them in that order.

440
00:46:10,641 --> 00:46:11,521
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what steps are.

441
00:46:11,982 --> 00:46:18,225
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, I'm fine with the language suggested by whoever typed that in, but they're just not steps.

442
00:46:19,658 --> 00:46:20,639
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just continue on.

443
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:26,804
[SPEAKER_08]: We have, in one place we have birth gender, another place we have birth sex, and I don't have a preference for one.

444
00:46:27,004 --> 00:46:28,685
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think they should be consistent.

445
00:46:29,365 --> 00:46:34,729
[SPEAKER_13]: One of information I didn't understand what you just said, in one place we have gender and one place we have what?

446
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:41,194
[SPEAKER_08]: No, in one place we had birth gender in the name and pronoun section, and another place we have

447
00:46:41,653 --> 00:46:45,615
[SPEAKER_08]: birth sex under the privacy confidentiality and student records.

448
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:52,497
[SPEAKER_08]: They both have the same sentence, students assigned birth gender, students assigned birth sex.

449
00:46:54,338 --> 00:46:57,439
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what the right one is, but one of them should be the right one.

450
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:04,022
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, member Russo, can you just point me to where that is so I can make that correction?

451
00:47:07,183 --> 00:47:09,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, under edit, you can also do find and replace.

452
00:47:10,765 --> 00:47:13,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's under privacy, Dr. Edward Vincent.

453
00:47:15,807 --> 00:47:19,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Scroll down, page something.

454
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:24,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Nope, too far.

455
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:26,611
[SPEAKER_09]: One more.

456
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:36,194
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, again, point of information, you could just do under edit, you can do find birth, sex, and then replace it with whatever.

457
00:47:36,374 --> 00:47:39,035
[SPEAKER_13]: So the find and replace button is super handy if you're searching.

458
00:47:43,851 --> 00:47:45,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Did we lose the superintendent?

459
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like it.

460
00:47:47,954 --> 00:47:48,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is that what happened?

461
00:47:49,475 --> 00:47:50,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, let me share my screen.

462
00:47:50,716 --> 00:47:52,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I can direct you.

463
00:47:52,778 --> 00:47:53,859
[SPEAKER_08]: You're in the same document, yeah.

464
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:54,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I am.

465
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:02,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you see that?

466
00:48:04,107 --> 00:48:04,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming up.

467
00:48:05,088 --> 00:48:05,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

468
00:48:06,469 --> 00:48:06,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

469
00:48:08,454 --> 00:48:12,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I just added some page numbers here so that we can direct people accordingly.

470
00:48:12,935 --> 00:48:15,396
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's two places, right?

471
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:20,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So privacy, confidentiality and student records uses students assigned birth sex.

472
00:48:21,337 --> 00:48:26,778
[SPEAKER_02]: And under gender markers, we use students birth name and gender.

473
00:48:27,378 --> 00:48:30,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think the question is, it should be consistent.

474
00:48:33,956 --> 00:48:38,960
[SPEAKER_08]: And I didn't read the many documents that Member Hayes said, which I appreciated.

475
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:45,005
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if there is a preference or a correct way to talk about the gender assigned at birth.

476
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:48,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever is correct, we should use.

477
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:56,055
[SPEAKER_01]: I would suggest just changing the first one there in privacy, confidentiality, and student records, change it to birth gender.

478
00:48:57,176 --> 00:48:58,497
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the rest of them say gender.

479
00:49:05,174 --> 00:49:05,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

480
00:49:06,555 --> 00:49:07,736
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you.

481
00:49:07,896 --> 00:49:09,157
[SPEAKER_09]: And let me keep moving.

482
00:49:15,082 --> 00:49:16,062
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the next one.

483
00:49:24,129 --> 00:49:32,295
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, under privacy confidentiality and student record, I certainly don't disagree one bit with the intent of

484
00:49:33,008 --> 00:49:40,895
[SPEAKER_08]: the regulation, but I do need to point out that the words gender, sex, those are not in the regulation anywhere.

485
00:49:41,055 --> 00:49:45,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I did a search and I actually included the link right in the meeting chat.

486
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:53,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Those words don't exist in the currently published regulations.

487
00:49:54,086 --> 00:50:00,972
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just feel like having it in line and the privacy confidentiality and student records is sort of implying

488
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:03,732
[SPEAKER_08]: that that's what's actually in there when it's not.

489
00:50:04,633 --> 00:50:06,314
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know.

490
00:50:06,334 --> 00:50:17,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we don't typically, in many of our newer policies, we're putting all the references at the bottom, and this is in the bottom too, which is fine, rather than inline.

491
00:50:17,303 --> 00:50:23,969
[SPEAKER_08]: And this just inline seems to drive home the point that, hey, this policy says exactly this, and it doesn't.

492
00:50:25,435 --> 00:50:27,417
[SPEAKER_08]: So this regulation, sorry.

493
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:30,259
[SPEAKER_08]: So my preference is that we cut that.

494
00:50:30,279 --> 00:50:33,481
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if anybody has disagreement.

495
00:50:35,142 --> 00:50:37,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this the piece that you're suggesting?

496
00:50:37,244 --> 00:50:37,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

497
00:50:37,364 --> 00:50:37,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

498
00:50:38,145 --> 00:50:38,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

499
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:49,934
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's exactly how it's worded on the DESE page under the, again, that safe and supportive environment.

500
00:50:49,954 --> 00:50:53,236
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually is lifted directly from that page.

501
00:50:55,216 --> 00:50:58,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, so I that makes much more sense to me.

502
00:50:59,738 --> 00:51:02,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't see that on the page, so I think that's great.

503
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:05,700
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't know if we want to replace that with the link to that page.

504
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,121
[SPEAKER_08]: That's I'd be totally fine with that.

505
00:51:10,141 --> 00:51:17,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor.

506
00:51:22,225 --> 00:51:23,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McLaughlin, thank you.

507
00:51:25,136 --> 00:51:27,737
[SPEAKER_13]: I think putting a hyperlink under the text would be fine.

508
00:51:33,361 --> 00:51:33,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

509
00:51:35,022 --> 00:51:39,425
[SPEAKER_08]: And just so we're clear, to the website that Amber Hayes mentioned.

510
00:51:40,966 --> 00:51:43,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

511
00:51:43,087 --> 00:51:53,654
[SPEAKER_08]: In a number of places, I know we talked about this extensively already, but in a number of places we say, in the case of a younger student, did we decide, because I don't think, let me look at the motions,

512
00:51:54,676 --> 00:51:59,018
[SPEAKER_08]: No, did we decide what we will replace the words younger student with?

513
00:52:11,965 --> 00:52:15,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Does somebody have a, which hyperlink is it that I should be putting in here?

514
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:22,591
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Hayes, point of,

515
00:52:29,258 --> 00:52:40,714
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to the, it's the DESE website, webpage for their guidance for Massachusetts public schools, creating a safe and supportive school environment.

516
00:52:41,795 --> 00:52:43,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you put it in the chat for me?

517
00:52:43,938 --> 00:52:45,680
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll look for it.

518
00:52:45,761 --> 00:52:45,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

519
00:52:58,302 --> 00:53:01,903
[SPEAKER_02]: So can I just ask a point of order question before we continue?

520
00:53:02,783 --> 00:53:08,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to be going through this sequentially or do we want to hop around?

521
00:53:08,284 --> 00:53:17,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I feel like members of those comments are moving all around the document and I just don't want everybody to be doing different things.

522
00:53:21,007 --> 00:53:22,088
[SPEAKER_13]: I prefer sequentially.

523
00:53:26,149 --> 00:53:27,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the link, Mr. Tucci.

524
00:53:32,183 --> 00:53:32,503
[SPEAKER_01]: May I?

525
00:53:33,063 --> 00:53:35,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, that's a different link, I think.

526
00:53:35,524 --> 00:53:36,904
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of different pages.

527
00:53:36,924 --> 00:53:41,605
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

528
00:53:41,865 --> 00:53:42,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, I'm sorry.

529
00:53:42,725 --> 00:53:43,705
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm wrong.

530
00:53:43,745 --> 00:53:44,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. Tucci.

531
00:53:44,825 --> 00:53:46,206
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the right link.

532
00:53:47,206 --> 00:53:47,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.

533
00:53:47,626 --> 00:53:47,886
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

534
00:53:49,386 --> 00:53:54,607
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it all depends on how many people have edits on what order we do it in.

535
00:53:54,707 --> 00:53:58,008
[SPEAKER_12]: So remember, does anybody else have

536
00:54:00,228 --> 00:54:02,689
[SPEAKER_12]: more than one or two edits by Member McLaughlin.

537
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:10,953
[SPEAKER_12]: So if it's only Member McLaughlin and Member Rousseau, I think we just lack some edits.

538
00:54:11,033 --> 00:54:12,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, yeah, sorry.

539
00:54:12,733 --> 00:54:13,073
[SPEAKER_13]: May I?

540
00:54:13,974 --> 00:54:15,054
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

541
00:54:15,434 --> 00:54:16,435
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not that I have edits.

542
00:54:16,635 --> 00:54:27,940
[SPEAKER_13]: It's that I think for the viewing public, it's probably easier to go through in order so that we're not jumping all over the place since we're more familiar with the document than others may be.

543
00:54:31,522 --> 00:54:38,688
[SPEAKER_12]: So member Russo, you wanna continue and go in order and as people have edits in the same space.

544
00:54:39,389 --> 00:54:42,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I guess I was confused by what we meant by, sorry mayor.

545
00:54:44,053 --> 00:54:46,415
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I just said we'll go paragraph by paragraph.

546
00:54:46,455 --> 00:54:54,882
[SPEAKER_12]: You start us out and then as members have also have comments in that section, please raise your hand and I'll call on you so we can go section by section.

547
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I was doing that some of the changes were across the whole document.

548
00:55:00,022 --> 00:55:01,743
[SPEAKER_08]: So I didn't want to have the conversation 5 times.

549
00:55:02,804 --> 00:55:05,145
[SPEAKER_08]: I was literally moving down the document.

550
00:55:05,225 --> 00:55:05,465
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

551
00:55:07,206 --> 00:55:10,868
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm my next comments are actually not until.

552
00:55:12,989 --> 00:55:15,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Privacy, confidentiality and student records, so I don't know.

553
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:18,492
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to let everybody else do their stuff up until that point.

554
00:55:23,894 --> 00:55:28,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there other comments about the transitions section?

555
00:55:32,617 --> 00:55:35,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I go back to names and pronouns?

556
00:55:35,278 --> 00:55:41,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there was something I was going to add or talk about adding in there, or it could be added to the student records.

557
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:50,002
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had talked earlier about adding, actually adding the full text of the regulation, student records regulation 603 CMR 23.01.

558
00:55:54,082 --> 00:56:11,725
[SPEAKER_01]: So that could be added into probably any one of these sections, but it just specifies the fact that if there's a, for a records request change, records change request, sorry, that that's when those age ranges are defined by regulation.

559
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:23,147
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think names and pronouns is where the first time there's a place that talks about changing student records.

560
00:56:41,005 --> 00:56:50,194
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can either read it out loud for someone to try to type, or if you just want to put in that I will put the full text of 603 CMR 23.01.

561
00:56:50,695 --> 00:56:53,438
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just put the text in the chat?

562
00:56:54,819 --> 00:56:56,961
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very long, and I don't type that fast.

563
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:57,742
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very long.

564
00:56:58,463 --> 00:57:01,546
[SPEAKER_01]: It's four or five, six lines.

565
00:57:03,772 --> 00:57:05,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is it on paper?

566
00:57:05,032 --> 00:57:06,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

567
00:57:06,833 --> 00:57:07,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

568
00:57:07,853 --> 00:57:08,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

569
00:57:08,733 --> 00:57:09,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay.

570
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:10,213
[SPEAKER_02]: So where does it go?

571
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:10,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Hayes?

572
00:57:12,393 --> 00:57:18,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I had put it after the sentence, nothing more formal than usage is required.

573
00:57:24,976 --> 00:57:25,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

574
00:57:25,736 --> 00:57:26,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, found it.

575
00:57:28,456 --> 00:57:28,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

576
00:57:29,576 --> 00:57:30,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

577
00:57:31,997 --> 00:57:32,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I,

578
00:57:34,266 --> 00:57:59,803
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, with regard to changes to the student record, student records regulations 603 CMR 23.01 states that, quote, these rights shall be the rights of the student upon reaching 14 years of age or upon entering the ninth grade, whichever comes first.

579
00:58:02,082 --> 00:58:02,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

580
00:58:02,502 --> 00:58:03,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you say that again?

581
00:58:05,964 --> 00:58:07,104
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm in typing class.

582
00:58:08,645 --> 00:58:09,265
[SPEAKER_01]: You're better than me.

583
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:10,345
[SPEAKER_01]: I never picked it up.

584
00:58:11,786 --> 00:58:26,731
[SPEAKER_01]: These rights shall be the rights of the student upon reaching 14 years of age or upon reaching the ninth grade, whichever comes first.

585
00:58:35,771 --> 00:58:49,135
[SPEAKER_01]: If a student is under the age of 14 and has not yet entered the 9th grade, these rights shall belong to the student's parent.

586
00:58:56,176 --> 00:59:02,818
[SPEAKER_01]: If a student is from 14 through 17 years of age or has entered the 9th grade,

587
00:59:15,646 --> 00:59:33,397
[SPEAKER_01]: both the student and his or her parent, or either one acting alone, shall exercise these rights.

588
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,161
[SPEAKER_09]: What information?

589
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:50,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information members, there's more, but yeah, I'm looking at the current regulation.

590
00:59:51,786 --> 00:59:56,650
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see that language and I'm not, I'm just not sure where you're reading it from.

591
00:59:56,670 --> 01:00:01,813
[SPEAKER_01]: 6, well, I can look it up to 603 CMR 23.01.

592
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:17,870
[SPEAKER_08]: These are different.

593
01:00:18,191 --> 01:00:24,095
[SPEAKER_08]: It's repeated a second time later on in the regulation, which is why I was confused.

594
01:00:24,155 --> 01:00:29,979
[SPEAKER_08]: It's repeated, but then they don't make the effort to include Section 2, which you're typing, which you're adding.

595
01:00:35,123 --> 01:00:35,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

596
01:00:36,364 --> 01:00:37,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

597
01:00:37,405 --> 01:00:41,228
[SPEAKER_01]: So after these rights, if a student is 18 years of age or older,

598
01:00:52,031 --> 01:01:03,833
[SPEAKER_01]: He, she alone shall exercise these rights subject to the following.

599
01:01:09,795 --> 01:01:17,156
[SPEAKER_01]: The parent may continue to exercise the rights until expressly limited by the student, end quote.

600
01:01:35,714 --> 01:01:37,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that, is that correct?

601
01:01:40,657 --> 01:01:41,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that where the quote goes?

602
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,921
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I put it in.

603
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:49,363
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm certainly open to if there seems to be a better place for it.

604
01:01:49,383 --> 01:01:59,089
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

605
01:02:17,506 --> 01:02:30,089
[SPEAKER_01]: I would ask my colleagues, if it makes sense there, is it clear that this applies just to requests to change the name and gender markers on the student record?

606
01:02:30,109 --> 01:02:45,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I would personally put that in the student records section because that's what you're sort of referring to here, right?

607
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:47,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

608
01:02:53,844 --> 01:02:54,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I was considering that.

609
01:02:54,845 --> 01:03:00,850
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was looking at, since this is the first place where it comes up the idea of changing a name and student record.

610
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:04,633
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think whichever one people think is clearer.

611
01:03:18,226 --> 01:03:26,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I might suggest we put it with the student record and then move the student record piece and the privacy and confidentiality piece up to the top.

612
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:38,511
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would look like this.

613
01:04:05,612 --> 01:04:06,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I make a suggestion on that?

614
01:04:08,653 --> 01:04:11,874
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like this whole section would go here.

615
01:04:13,695 --> 01:04:18,637
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sets the sort of sets the stage for everything that follows.

616
01:04:33,022 --> 01:04:34,362
[SPEAKER_08]: There, could I make a suggestion on that?

617
01:04:34,878 --> 01:04:35,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

618
01:04:35,138 --> 01:04:35,779
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Rousseau.

619
01:04:35,799 --> 01:04:38,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just suggest we take the quotes out?

620
01:04:38,642 --> 01:04:44,489
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to actually use exactly their language, and we certainly don't have to, because we use caregivers.

621
01:04:47,792 --> 01:04:52,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I would rather we not mix the language we use with the language they used.

622
01:04:53,979 --> 01:04:54,800
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my suggestion.

623
01:05:07,748 --> 01:05:27,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm just thinking that then this, this can be deleted because we cover it in like the more explicit detail here, right?

624
01:05:27,835 --> 01:05:34,837
[SPEAKER_02]: So we cover what happens at each age rather than saying like younger students and here's what happens.

625
01:06:16,363 --> 01:06:16,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor?

626
01:06:18,104 --> 01:06:18,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Marisol?

627
01:06:19,344 --> 01:06:26,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Since we're talking about younger students, other than in this section, would it make sense to replace younger students with students under the age of 14?

628
01:06:26,746 --> 01:06:29,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yes, I think it should be more clear.

629
01:06:29,327 --> 01:06:37,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, where is the... One second.

630
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:43,211
[SPEAKER_09]: It is... Oops, let me go back up.

631
01:06:44,482 --> 01:06:54,689
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the names and pronouns, second to last sentence, case of a younger student, so a student under the age of 14.

632
01:06:57,991 --> 01:06:58,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Cursor's almost there.

633
01:07:00,812 --> 01:07:02,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Next, down one, there it is.

634
01:07:04,595 --> 01:07:06,856
[SPEAKER_01]: May I ask a question about this before we make changes?

635
01:07:08,697 --> 01:07:09,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Hayes?

636
01:07:10,475 --> 01:07:19,097
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to be clear again, because we did have this conversation earlier, that the 14 years of age only applies to if they're requesting a student records change.

637
01:07:19,557 --> 01:07:22,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these that we're changing now are not referring to a record change.

638
01:07:22,718 --> 01:07:29,680
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just referring to a student asking for informal changes at school.

639
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:35,881
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a different, that doesn't fall under the records request where the 14-year-old age range comes into play.

640
01:07:40,367 --> 01:07:43,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that clarification, because I actually didn't get that.

641
01:07:44,549 --> 01:07:46,289
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we said it earlier, but I didn't understand that.

642
01:07:46,369 --> 01:07:55,492
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess my question, though, is at what age are staff expected to be consulting with parents versus not?

643
01:07:56,353 --> 01:08:00,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Or are they just expected to never consult with parents, period?

644
01:08:00,254 --> 01:08:05,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, I mean, I don't know what the expectation right now is in this policy.

645
01:08:19,398 --> 01:08:22,760
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we have a resident that would like to speak as well.

646
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,601
[SPEAKER_12]: So member Hayes, you have your hand up, I'll let you go first.

647
01:08:26,201 --> 01:08:29,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

648
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:37,487
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, as we talked about earlier, that is not defined by DESE anywhere.

649
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:43,169
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I think they make it clear that the reasoning for that is that every case is individual.

650
01:08:43,309 --> 01:08:46,831
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the case where again, a student is either

651
01:08:49,557 --> 01:08:53,339
[SPEAKER_01]: uncomfortable or truly afraid of talking to their parents about this.

652
01:08:53,960 --> 01:09:16,953
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, it gives the school and the staff involved the flexibility of taking the student's safety and mental health concerns into account before making the determination to talk to the parents and gives the student the right to actually say, I don't want you to tell my parents at this point.

653
01:09:17,401 --> 01:09:19,782
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is no age range given anywhere for that.

654
01:09:25,005 --> 01:09:46,635
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that goes back just again to member Graham saying earlier, some of this falls under the implementation piece of how are we, and I think Mr. Tucci also talked about them, how they do this already at the McGlynn in terms of creating a team, whoever that team may be that would work with the student to talk about

655
01:09:48,064 --> 01:09:50,466
[SPEAKER_01]: why they don't want to tell their family if that's the case.

656
01:09:50,506 --> 01:09:54,409
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we also need to add that that is likely to be a rare case.

657
01:09:54,990 --> 01:10:01,655
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in most cases, especially for younger students, the family is probably aware and involved.

658
01:10:01,755 --> 01:10:04,918
[SPEAKER_01]: But in those cases where we actually have a student who

659
01:10:07,386 --> 01:10:19,832
[SPEAKER_01]: who expresses concern about telling their family, we do need to give that leeway and talk about that implementation piece again, to go back, of how do you create that team of people to work with a student?

660
01:10:21,212 --> 01:10:23,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Because ideally, you do want the family involved.

661
01:10:23,674 --> 01:10:31,957
[SPEAKER_01]: All the research shows that the best outcomes for LGBTQ students are when their families are involved and supportive and affirming.

662
01:10:32,418 --> 01:10:34,659
[SPEAKER_01]: So the

663
01:10:35,805 --> 01:10:39,128
[SPEAKER_01]: emphasis of the school would be to try to figure out how to bring the family in.

664
01:10:39,428 --> 01:10:51,397
[SPEAKER_01]: But in that moment that a student is expressing fear or concern about doing that, to have that leeway to make that determination that at this point in time, we're not going to go right to the family.

665
01:10:51,417 --> 01:11:01,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Began.

666
01:11:08,413 --> 01:11:12,714
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Began, would you, Attorney Began, would you give me a hand up?

667
01:11:16,575 --> 01:11:18,896
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, until he responds, let's keep moving on.

668
01:11:18,916 --> 01:11:22,417
[SPEAKER_12]: Or maybe, oh, let's see.

669
01:11:23,678 --> 01:11:27,219
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, no, it's a muting issue, hold on.

670
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:32,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address for the record?

671
01:11:33,661 --> 01:11:37,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Sean Began, 362 Lawrence Road, Medford.

672
01:11:39,612 --> 01:11:42,193
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting discussion.

673
01:11:43,293 --> 01:12:03,097
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the issues, and when I read, when this proposed resolution was in the initial agenda, that term younger students really popped out at me and was concerning for me as a parent, because it's a very vague,

674
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:09,664
[SPEAKER_00]: definition, probably purposely so, I guess, based on what Ms.

675
01:12:09,684 --> 01:12:10,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes is saying.

676
01:12:12,867 --> 01:12:27,461
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that it could cause issues and could raise potential parent right issues, even at a constitutional level as to what a parent's rights are, in regards to decisions like this, in regards to the children.

677
01:12:28,682 --> 01:12:29,723
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounded like

678
01:12:30,626 --> 01:12:48,277
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was listening to Mr. Tucci, that the school currently has a policy where children under eighth grade and below, the parents are involved, and it sounds like they're involved at all stages on all issues.

679
01:12:49,077 --> 01:12:59,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I misunderstood that, in that ninth grade and above, it then would become more of a student's call, which I think makes some sense to me.

680
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:19,624
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I would necessarily agree that a six or seven-year-old who comes to a teacher and says, I want to make some sort of transition, don't tell my parents that it's the schools, that the school would be keeping that information from parents or keeping that discussion from parents.

681
01:13:21,705 --> 01:13:23,647
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that that sits with me.

682
01:13:23,707 --> 01:13:24,508
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that it's,

683
01:13:25,342 --> 01:13:29,103
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily legal if we looked into the parameters.

684
01:13:29,163 --> 01:13:34,624
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what DESI has put out from my understanding is guidance.

685
01:13:35,364 --> 01:13:45,626
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're doing here is you're copying and pasting what is guidance and making it, trying to make it a firm policy that has teeth.

686
01:13:45,826 --> 01:13:51,048
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when you have vague terms, you run into issues.

687
01:13:51,328 --> 01:13:52,708
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that younger,

688
01:13:53,596 --> 01:14:02,502
[SPEAKER_00]: student question is going to be, without some definition of what a younger student is, is going to be a problem for teachers and administrators.

689
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:09,086
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it sounds like if this were to pass as written, it would be a change in policy from what is currently done.

690
01:14:09,806 --> 01:14:14,369
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does sound like there's a pretty standard policy in place already.

691
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:17,391
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my comment.

692
01:14:18,091 --> 01:14:19,212
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, one more thing.

693
01:14:19,792 --> 01:14:22,494
[SPEAKER_00]: The term caregiver is an umbrella term.

694
01:14:23,539 --> 01:14:33,646
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that some of what is being discussed here, where the term parent or guardian is used, parent and guardian have legal definitions under certain statutes.

695
01:14:33,686 --> 01:14:39,250
[SPEAKER_00]: So perhaps you need, at the beginning of this policy, some definitions.

696
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:46,395
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you have a definition for what a caregiver is to explain that that covers the terms parent and guardian.

697
01:14:48,296 --> 01:14:51,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Because caregiver, I don't know, is kind of a catch-all phrase again.

698
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:52,599
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all.

699
01:14:55,933 --> 01:14:57,134
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Attorney Begum.

700
01:14:58,574 --> 01:14:59,135
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Hayes?

701
01:15:03,817 --> 01:15:04,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

702
01:15:04,757 --> 01:15:11,941
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, well, first of all, to respond to the question of what we're already doing, we don't have a policy in place about this yet.

703
01:15:12,081 --> 01:15:17,824
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of what's being done at the schools, it's not necessarily based on a policy.

704
01:15:18,396 --> 01:15:20,998
[SPEAKER_01]: It's based on what's been common practice at this point.

705
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:27,723
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of DESE's guidance, it is true that it's phrased as guidance.

706
01:15:29,544 --> 01:15:37,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly it's the school system's responsibility to take a law and take the guidance from DESE and form it into a policy.

707
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:45,555
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, DESE talks about that in part of that webpage, talking about schools creating policies.

708
01:15:47,321 --> 01:15:55,324
[SPEAKER_01]: At the minimum, they talk about making sure that our policies, our non-discrimination policies list gender identity, but they talk about that as being at the minimum.

709
01:15:57,845 --> 01:16:06,589
[SPEAKER_01]: We do currently, I think, as people may know, there is a court case going on right now in Ludlow, Massachusetts about this very question.

710
01:16:07,149 --> 01:16:13,992
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point, it's on appeal, but I did find both that our,

711
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:29,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents wrote an amicus brief in support of schools being able to have this flexibility to make a determination of what's in the best interest of the child at that point.

712
01:16:29,869 --> 01:16:43,559
[SPEAKER_01]: I think really the way they phrased it was in terms of creating a safe and supportive environment for students in which they can learn, because we know that precursors to being able to be available to learn, you have to feel safe and you have to feel supportive.

713
01:16:46,252 --> 01:17:09,794
[SPEAKER_01]: giving this ability for schools to make a decision, make a determination at that time, if a student is requesting and letting the school know that they're not comfortable with their parents being brought into the conversation at this point, that the Massachusetts School Association school superintendents came out in support of that and said that we need to be

714
01:17:12,179 --> 01:17:20,503
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to do that in order to have a learning environment that is conducive for students feeling safe and being able to learn.

715
01:17:20,523 --> 01:17:35,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I also found that our, we also have our Massachusetts Attorney General who came out in support of the idea of allowing schools this flexibility also.

716
01:17:36,266 --> 01:17:41,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a major, it is a major point of contention at this point, a concern for parents.

717
01:17:41,849 --> 01:17:59,677
[SPEAKER_01]: I did wanna, I was going to talk about an addition I wanted to make also to the, to hopefully allay some of those fears or concerns to add into the section.

718
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:01,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if I can find it.

719
01:18:07,752 --> 01:18:15,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Under transitions, to add a paragraph in there or a couple of sentences that does talk about, that says this.

720
01:18:16,136 --> 01:18:27,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Research shows that the best outcomes for LGBTQ students occur when the parents, primary caregivers, or whatever term we choose to use at this point, are involved in affirming.

721
01:18:28,222 --> 01:18:33,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, the primary goal of MPS staff, or Medford Public Schools,

722
01:18:33,595 --> 01:18:40,320
[SPEAKER_01]: will be to facilitate the relationship between the student and their parents whenever possible, primary caregivers whenever possible.

723
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:48,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that is our primary goal.

724
01:18:48,787 --> 01:18:51,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Our primary goal is what's best for the student.

725
01:18:51,669 --> 01:19:00,196
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that what's best for the student in any case is having the family involved, the family supportive, the family affirming.

726
01:19:00,942 --> 01:19:28,423
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a case where a student is concerned that that won't be the case, and there certainly is a lot of statistics out there about families that aren't supportive, students who do have difficulties at home if they let their parents know that they are transitioning or have a different gender identity than what their parents expect, that there are cases where students

727
01:19:29,048 --> 01:19:34,612
[SPEAKER_01]: have great difficulty at home if parents are involved.

728
01:19:34,852 --> 01:19:37,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you read that again so I can?

729
01:19:37,735 --> 01:19:38,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

730
01:19:38,115 --> 01:19:49,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Research shows that the best outcomes for LGBTQ students occur when the caregivers are involved in affirming.

731
01:19:52,946 --> 01:19:55,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, the primary goal of Medford Public Schools

732
01:19:56,141 --> 01:20:03,107
[SPEAKER_01]: will be to facilitate the relationship between the student and their primary caregivers wherever possible.

733
01:20:03,127 --> 01:20:07,670
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I'm open to any wordsmithing to that.

734
01:20:07,911 --> 01:20:19,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought it was important to put that in there because it is true that is the best outcome and that should be our primary goal is to get the parents and the student together.

735
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:21,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you read it one more time?

736
01:20:23,325 --> 01:20:30,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Research shows that the best outcomes for LGBTQ students occur when the primary caregivers are involved and affirming.

737
01:20:31,508 --> 01:20:40,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, the primary goal of Medford Public Schools will be to facilitate the relationship between the student and their primary caregiver wherever possible.

738
01:20:58,783 --> 01:21:08,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and member Hayes, where were you thinking this belonged at the top of this section?

739
01:21:09,853 --> 01:21:10,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere else.

740
01:21:11,094 --> 01:21:15,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

741
01:21:16,499 --> 01:21:22,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Right before where it says some transgender and gender nonconforming students are not openly so at home.

742
01:21:22,124 --> 01:21:25,127
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was gonna, I had it before that.

743
01:21:25,762 --> 01:21:33,609
[SPEAKER_01]: and then added at the beginning of that next sentence, the some transgender and gender nonconforming students added the word however.

744
01:21:47,961 --> 01:21:49,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thank you.

745
01:21:56,129 --> 01:21:58,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Rousseau.

746
01:21:58,411 --> 01:21:58,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

747
01:21:58,751 --> 01:22:00,933
[SPEAKER_08]: I certainly love the sentiment in this.

748
01:22:00,973 --> 01:22:06,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think that the policy sentences and the purpose of a document is to tell people what to do.

749
01:22:08,538 --> 01:22:14,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And the research part of that, I mean, that might be in a whereas, which I think actually there was.

750
01:22:14,943 --> 01:22:19,266
[SPEAKER_08]: That might have even been in the whereas of the proposal on the last agenda.

751
01:22:19,786 --> 01:22:25,090
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that getting rid of that research and starting with the primary goal

752
01:22:26,865 --> 01:22:33,348
[SPEAKER_08]: is reasonable, but I mean, research will be different at the time the next meeting happens.

753
01:22:34,889 --> 01:22:43,793
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to change the point of the, you know, the outcomes of very obvious outcomes for this kind of research, but I mean,

754
01:22:45,497 --> 01:22:47,919
[SPEAKER_08]: we could do this for every sentence in this whole thing.

755
01:22:47,979 --> 01:22:57,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the research that says this, here's the research that says, you know, that gender is not binary and not immutable.

756
01:22:58,766 --> 01:23:01,388
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's just my feeling on that.

757
01:23:01,428 --> 01:23:14,717
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to keep that sentence definitely, but I don't like couching it in research, which could, you know, God forbid the research changes tomorrow or somebody comes to us at a next school committee meeting, here's a pile of research that says that's not true.

758
01:23:15,529 --> 01:23:17,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not interested in that conversation.

759
01:23:19,131 --> 01:23:19,892
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just my thought.

760
01:23:19,932 --> 01:23:20,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

761
01:23:27,297 --> 01:23:34,141
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to take a vote on the updates to the transitions section as displayed.

762
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:53,403
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll certainly make the motion to accept the transition section as displayed.

763
01:23:56,206 --> 01:23:58,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion by member Graham.

764
01:24:03,732 --> 01:24:04,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call, please.

765
01:24:06,414 --> 01:24:06,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham?

766
01:24:07,755 --> 01:24:08,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

767
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:09,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hayes?

768
01:24:10,258 --> 01:24:10,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

769
01:24:11,799 --> 01:24:12,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kress?

770
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:13,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

771
01:24:14,861 --> 01:24:15,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin?

772
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:16,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

773
01:24:17,836 --> 01:24:20,457
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what people have for time, so we're already an hour and a half in.

774
01:24:20,477 --> 01:24:21,857
[SPEAKER_12]: I got nothing on

775
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:55,646
[SPEAKER_12]: second to last sentence, or the nurse's office, main, nurse's or main office restroom.

776
01:24:55,666 --> 01:25:02,491
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanna make sure every school has a restroom in their main office or nurse's suite.

777
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:05,013
[SPEAKER_12]: Otherwise we can move on.

778
01:25:06,715 --> 01:25:06,955
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

779
01:25:07,996 --> 01:25:08,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, great.

780
01:25:09,497 --> 01:25:13,460
[SPEAKER_12]: Gender mark, if nobody else has questions, so gender markers on student records.

781
01:25:19,261 --> 01:25:19,501
[SPEAKER_08]: there.

782
01:25:20,342 --> 01:25:21,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Rousseau?

783
01:25:21,983 --> 01:25:41,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, in the first sentence it says gender marker is a definition on school or other records that indicate, actually just indicate, no S. And then this sentence, here we are again on the young students.

784
01:25:42,015 --> 01:25:47,979
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the one where we want to change upon request by the student or in the case of

785
01:25:49,153 --> 01:25:50,234
[SPEAKER_08]: students under the age of 14.

786
01:25:50,835 --> 01:25:52,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this the correct place for that change?

787
01:25:52,537 --> 01:25:55,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I saw some hands shaking.

788
01:25:55,781 --> 01:26:06,033
[SPEAKER_08]: So getting rid of, changing the, in the case of young, just change young students not yet able to advocate for themselves to students under the age of 14.

789
01:26:21,414 --> 01:26:29,776
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my only other change was in the last sentence of that paragraph.

790
01:26:30,577 --> 01:26:39,359
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, oh, there it is.

791
01:26:39,799 --> 01:26:50,482
[SPEAKER_08]: The last sentence says, the last line, excuse me, up one, page three, end of page three, last line, a diploma or transcript that includes, that actually needs an S.

792
01:26:53,911 --> 01:26:56,072
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's it for that section.

793
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:18,784
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll make a motion to accept the section.

794
01:27:20,686 --> 01:27:20,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

795
01:27:21,146 --> 01:27:21,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

796
01:27:21,386 --> 01:27:26,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I remember Graham.

797
01:27:27,089 --> 01:27:31,131
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say for two, we'd have to put in under the age of 14.

798
01:27:31,171 --> 01:27:37,113
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because there's that clause to it, or has not yet entered ninth grade.

799
01:27:37,134 --> 01:27:38,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

800
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:02,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll make a motion to accept the gender markers and student records section.

801
01:28:02,428 --> 01:28:02,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry.

802
01:28:03,229 --> 01:28:13,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you do that, I would like to suggest that we move this section so that it goes with our records stuff.

803
01:28:14,413 --> 01:28:21,896
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talk about privacy, confidentiality, student records, and then we talk about gender markers and student records.

804
01:28:21,916 --> 01:28:25,458
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all in the same place in the policy, and then it goes from there.

805
01:28:27,439 --> 01:28:28,239
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would look like that.

806
01:28:30,171 --> 01:28:33,872
[SPEAKER_08]: make a motion to accept the gender markers on student records and to move the section.

807
01:28:36,233 --> 01:28:36,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

808
01:28:37,313 --> 01:28:39,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Graham.

809
01:28:40,334 --> 01:28:40,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call, please.

810
01:28:41,874 --> 01:28:42,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

811
01:28:43,295 --> 01:28:43,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

812
01:28:44,475 --> 01:28:44,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hayes.

813
01:28:45,415 --> 01:28:45,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

814
01:28:46,715 --> 01:28:47,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Kretz.

815
01:28:47,796 --> 01:28:48,036
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

816
01:28:49,016 --> 01:28:49,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin.

817
01:28:50,577 --> 01:28:50,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

818
01:28:52,097 --> 01:28:52,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Mastone, absent.

819
01:28:52,857 --> 01:28:54,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Rousseau, yes.

820
01:28:55,018 --> 01:28:55,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor Longo, current.

821
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:59,985
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one absent, motion passes.

822
01:29:01,807 --> 01:29:12,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so we're on to physical education classes and intramural and interscholastic athletic activities.

823
01:29:14,213 --> 01:29:18,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lost the place in my two screens here where I can raise my hand.

824
01:29:18,416 --> 01:29:19,436
[SPEAKER_02]: So just put my hand there.

825
01:29:19,456 --> 01:29:22,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Amber Graham, what do you got?

826
01:29:22,958 --> 01:29:39,167
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to make a motion that we strike this section because in the policy, the rules and policy subcommittee, we are completely revamping the wellness policy that has,

827
01:29:40,448 --> 01:29:44,090
[SPEAKER_02]: much of this same content in it.

828
01:29:44,311 --> 01:29:46,872
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like halfway through that change.

829
01:29:47,613 --> 01:29:55,578
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am concerned that if we're doing this stuff in two places, like they are going to be in conflict with each other.

830
01:29:55,658 --> 01:30:08,766
[SPEAKER_02]: So my preference would be that when we talk about physical education classes and intramural and interscholastic athletic activities under the wellness policy, that it is all inclusive of all things

831
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:21,042
[SPEAKER_02]: physical education, intramural, athletic, and that this language can just be sort of sent over there as like an infusion into that policy, which is in process.

832
01:30:29,243 --> 01:30:29,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that a motion?

833
01:30:29,844 --> 01:30:30,184
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

834
01:30:30,504 --> 01:30:30,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

835
01:30:31,844 --> 01:30:35,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to strike this and send it to the wellness policy.

836
01:30:35,605 --> 01:30:37,965
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion to strike by Member Graham, seconded by

837
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:39,901
[SPEAKER_01]: May I ask a question first?

838
01:30:40,222 --> 01:30:40,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Hayes, yeah.

839
01:30:41,023 --> 01:30:50,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a question, is there a reason why we can't have it in both so that it's part of the policy if people are looking specifically for policies related to gender identity?

840
01:30:50,914 --> 01:30:58,563
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's, I think we are like well documented in our

841
01:31:00,896 --> 01:31:03,016
[SPEAKER_02]: inability to maintain current policy.

842
01:31:03,297 --> 01:31:20,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just, it's a lot, it's a lot of work and we're woefully behind, like we're working as fast as we can, but here we are and we still have like an entire policy book that hasn't been reviewed in decades maybe.

843
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:27,542
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like, for me, that's one reason that I think that this belongs, it's more of like a hygiene issue.

844
01:31:29,522 --> 01:31:44,191
[SPEAKER_02]: The other reason I think it belongs there is because I don't want students to feel like they have to go to a special place to learn about the policy for themselves.

845
01:31:45,003 --> 01:31:49,025
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we're gonna have a policy, and I will have the same comment about dress code.

846
01:31:50,205 --> 01:31:56,188
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're gonna have a policy that covers physical education, it should cover physical education for all students.

847
01:31:56,708 --> 01:32:01,210
[SPEAKER_02]: It shouldn't be like, yeah, but then if you're this kind of student, you have to go here to find it.

848
01:32:01,330 --> 01:32:07,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that to me doesn't feel inclusive or protective.

849
01:32:07,953 --> 01:32:10,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want our students to feel like they're all

850
01:32:12,836 --> 01:32:21,963
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, part of the same team, essentially, when they're thinking about how the rules apply to them.

851
01:32:23,184 --> 01:32:35,213
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the only thing I would say is that this piece of the policy gets specifically at how transgender students can participate in interscholastic sports.

852
01:32:35,253 --> 01:32:36,974
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really a hygiene question.

853
01:32:38,475 --> 01:32:41,137
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is talking about the fact that

854
01:32:42,369 --> 01:32:46,330
[SPEAKER_01]: they can participate in the team that matches their gender identity.

855
01:32:47,010 --> 01:33:06,635
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's different, not necessarily specific to a wellness policy, but it is definitely specific to a policy about what we will do to apply laws of non-discrimination to students who are transgender.

856
01:33:10,771 --> 01:33:13,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Russo, then Member McLaughlin.

857
01:33:14,894 --> 01:33:15,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

858
01:33:15,995 --> 01:33:16,376
[SPEAKER_08]: The opposite?

859
01:33:16,396 --> 01:33:18,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I certainly, can you hear me okay?

860
01:33:19,859 --> 01:33:23,321
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I think Member McLaughlin might've had her hand up first, I didn't catch.

861
01:33:23,642 --> 01:33:26,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry, Member McLaughlin, go ahead, you can go first.

862
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:28,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, appreciate it.

863
01:33:28,926 --> 01:33:36,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, I was just gonna say, I think in the spirit of inclusivity, actually, it bears repeating.

864
01:33:36,633 --> 01:33:40,978
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do think that I would say the same for other situations when there are other.

865
01:33:43,014 --> 01:33:44,916
[SPEAKER_13]: subgroups or other entities.

866
01:33:44,976 --> 01:34:00,506
[SPEAKER_13]: So for example, if it was a student with a disability, it would be a repeating both in the, you know, section on, you know, special education supports and services and perhaps on in curriculum, there's no need to have it in one or the other and look for and have people have to hunt around for it.

867
01:34:00,526 --> 01:34:03,848
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, which one did the school committee decide that they were going to put it under?

868
01:34:04,348 --> 01:34:06,670
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it bears repeating.

869
01:34:10,472 --> 01:34:11,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member Rousseau.

870
01:34:12,301 --> 01:34:12,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

871
01:34:12,781 --> 01:34:17,385
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in agreement with all of these options, actually.

872
01:34:18,485 --> 01:34:28,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, when I think about what a policy looks like on the ground when it's getting used, because it has to be acknowledged, we cannot maintain our policies.

873
01:34:29,052 --> 01:34:39,960
[SPEAKER_08]: We make a change here, nobody goes, there's no system in place to go and find the 32 other policies that need to be updated that now says we use the word caregivers as we decided like four years ago.

874
01:34:40,771 --> 01:34:45,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Every policy has the word caregivers in it, but it doesn't now.

875
01:34:46,054 --> 01:34:48,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now it says parent and guardian, probably doesn't even say caregiver.

876
01:34:49,375 --> 01:35:07,864
[SPEAKER_08]: My point is just, if I pick up a policy as a staff member and I read it and I use it, and it's got language that is no longer correct, because there was another policy that made another change that should have been updated and injected into the policy, then what you end up with is people not following the policies,

877
01:35:08,342 --> 01:35:09,203
[SPEAKER_08]: when they are trying.

878
01:35:10,624 --> 01:35:19,110
[SPEAKER_08]: And you also create, frankly, the mountain of outdated policies we have would take a school committee of 100 people 10 years to get through.

879
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:20,151
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the truth.

880
01:35:21,012 --> 01:35:24,334
[SPEAKER_08]: So I am very much opposed to duplicating stuff.

881
01:35:25,135 --> 01:35:28,938
[SPEAKER_08]: The other argument for not duplicating, though, I think is important.

882
01:35:29,798 --> 01:35:34,562
[SPEAKER_08]: As we saw with the bullying policy, when it's 37 pages, nobody read it.

883
01:35:36,141 --> 01:35:39,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand administrators probably went through it and they tried to find parts that they cared about.

884
01:35:39,482 --> 01:35:40,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody read that thing top to bottom.

885
01:35:42,383 --> 01:35:44,883
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure I'll get an email from somebody who says, yes, I did.

886
01:35:46,124 --> 01:35:51,665
[SPEAKER_08]: But when policies are multiple pages or longer, they get read less.

887
01:35:52,265 --> 01:35:53,665
[SPEAKER_08]: They just don't get read as much.

888
01:35:54,225 --> 01:35:55,766
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got lots of things on my desk.

889
01:35:56,066 --> 01:35:57,186
[SPEAKER_08]: The one-pagers get read.

890
01:35:57,726 --> 01:36:00,427
[SPEAKER_08]: The 32-page documents sit there for months or years.

891
01:36:01,859 --> 01:36:11,107
[SPEAKER_08]: And so whether it's right or wrong, if we want people to read our policies and to implement them with fidelity, they have to be readable.

892
01:36:11,388 --> 01:36:17,674
[SPEAKER_08]: So I am opposed to including the PE section and the dress code.

893
01:36:17,754 --> 01:36:24,220
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the other thing I also just want to quickly say is, I don't understand the reading of,

894
01:36:25,717 --> 01:36:30,503
[SPEAKER_08]: The MIA will rely on the gender determination made by the student's district.

895
01:36:30,563 --> 01:36:32,946
[SPEAKER_08]: It will not make separate gender identity determinations.

896
01:36:33,406 --> 01:36:41,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that actually just a statement of fact or are we asserting that we can tell the MIA what they can and can't do?

897
01:36:41,496 --> 01:36:45,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I don't know the legal stuff here, but we can write something down.

898
01:36:46,394 --> 01:36:50,196
[SPEAKER_08]: And if the MIA has authority and it's like, no, we're gonna make our own determinations.

899
01:36:50,396 --> 01:36:52,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, our policy means nothing.

900
01:36:53,117 --> 01:36:55,919
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just think I need to understand what that is saying.

901
01:36:56,419 --> 01:36:56,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

902
01:37:00,321 --> 01:37:03,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McLaughlin and Member Hayes.

903
01:37:04,143 --> 01:37:09,186
[SPEAKER_13]: I was gonna offer Member Hayes the opportunity to respond to that if she'd like before I address my concern.

904
01:37:10,026 --> 01:37:11,547
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Hayes, Member McLaughlin.

905
01:37:13,368 --> 01:37:13,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

906
01:37:14,155 --> 01:37:15,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Member McLaughlin.

907
01:37:15,155 --> 01:37:31,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just wanted to respond to that last, well, a couple of things, but in terms of that last sentence, that again comes directly from the MIA handbook on their rules regarding gender identity and participation in sports.

908
01:37:33,603 --> 01:37:40,466
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just to add, I guess, if I don't agree or disagree really about whether we can have it in two places,

909
01:37:40,987 --> 01:37:50,795
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that given, again, that this is written to really specifically talk about gender identity and participation in sports, that I think it needs to be here.

910
01:37:50,935 --> 01:37:52,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with the dress code.

911
01:37:53,217 --> 01:37:54,558
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have to look back.

912
01:37:54,739 --> 01:38:02,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe someone can tell me if we already have something that talks about gender identity and gender expression in our dress code.

913
01:38:02,685 --> 01:38:04,427
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's already in there, then that's true.

914
01:38:04,467 --> 01:38:06,629
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't need to be repeated again necessarily.

915
01:38:07,449 --> 01:38:09,071
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's not there, then I think

916
01:38:10,771 --> 01:38:22,675
[SPEAKER_01]: as a part of this policy, which is all about how we're going to apply non-discrimination by gender identity in terms of our different aspects of the school day, then I think it does belong here.

917
01:38:29,117 --> 01:38:29,777
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin.

918
01:38:31,458 --> 01:38:31,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

919
01:38:32,518 --> 01:38:34,459
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just going to say, and to the point about

920
01:38:36,205 --> 01:38:40,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Frankly, reading or not reading or searching or accessibility or anything like that.

921
01:38:41,129 --> 01:38:49,456
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the one, the only place that policy in our school district exists on the website is under school committee NPS policy.

922
01:38:50,617 --> 01:38:55,501
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not searchable unless you go into that document so you can't search the website and look for.

923
01:38:57,242 --> 01:39:02,728
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, gender affirming care, anything like that, like you can't search our website for that necessarily.

924
01:39:03,168 --> 01:39:20,125
[SPEAKER_13]: You can go into if you know, you can go into the school committee button and then look under NPS policies, and then go into this Z account that is created through MASC with all these policies that we've used their template for, and then modified ourselves and, you know, search under that.

925
01:39:20,545 --> 01:39:21,386
[SPEAKER_13]: if you know how to do it.

926
01:39:22,366 --> 01:39:31,292
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we have a much, much bigger issue, frankly, to deal with around our accessibility and our policy, which we're doing a lot of policy revision.

927
01:39:31,312 --> 01:39:37,616
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't even talked about accessibility and how people find out this information, which I think is a really important piece.

928
01:39:37,716 --> 01:39:43,419
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, as we're thinking about language and how we're writing policy, whether it's going to be easily translated, how that works.

929
01:39:43,439 --> 01:39:45,841
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there's so much that we haven't addressed in these things.

930
01:39:47,079 --> 01:39:56,665
[SPEAKER_13]: priority and primary of which should be, how do people even know what the policies are and how they exist, including our staff, including our families, including our administration, because they don't.

931
01:39:57,385 --> 01:40:05,110
[SPEAKER_13]: So here we are working on all this time, revising policies, and we're talking about, well, how it gets implemented and whether it gets implemented and why it doesn't get implemented.

932
01:40:05,150 --> 01:40:12,295
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think one of the biggest reasons is because nobody knows where to find it, number one, and number two, they don't know how to search it, they're not using it.

933
01:40:12,455 --> 01:40:14,436
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that has to be addressed.

934
01:40:22,631 --> 01:40:23,872
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think- I second that motion.

935
01:40:23,892 --> 01:40:35,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, motion to strike the last two sections, physical education classes, intramural and interscholastic athletic activities.

936
01:40:36,119 --> 01:40:38,481
[SPEAKER_12]: So can I just ask a question before the roll is called?

937
01:40:38,621 --> 01:40:44,945
[SPEAKER_12]: Does this include middle school and high school sports as well?

938
01:40:51,629 --> 01:40:52,209
[SPEAKER_12]: No, correct?

939
01:40:55,046 --> 01:40:57,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is from the interscholastic.

940
01:40:57,207 --> 01:40:58,347
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from MIAA.

941
01:40:58,407 --> 01:41:02,248
[SPEAKER_01]: So I assume that it didn't specify grade levels.

942
01:41:02,288 --> 01:41:05,169
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm assuming it covers all grades.

943
01:41:13,392 --> 01:41:13,532
OK.

944
01:41:13,552 --> 01:41:13,592
OK.

945
01:41:15,702 --> 01:41:20,906
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have a dress code policy and I just, okay, I'm just trying to think through it in my head and there's arguments.

946
01:41:21,787 --> 01:41:34,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say that our dress code policy is more broad than this because we worked hard to be not at all gendered when we wrote the dress code policy.

947
01:41:34,738 --> 01:41:39,863
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is actually like a little more like prescriptive about

948
01:41:41,064 --> 01:41:43,645
[SPEAKER_02]: what we allow and what we don't allow, then our dress code policy is.

949
01:41:43,705 --> 01:41:45,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Our dress code policy is much more broad than this.

950
01:42:00,269 --> 01:42:06,751
[SPEAKER_12]: Roll call vote, I guess, to strike at the last two sections.

951
01:42:08,692 --> 01:42:09,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham.

952
01:42:10,012 --> 01:42:10,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

953
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:11,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Hayes?

954
01:42:12,718 --> 01:42:12,959
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

955
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:14,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Gritz?

956
01:42:14,621 --> 01:42:15,522
[SPEAKER_08]: I think already left.

957
01:42:16,623 --> 01:42:17,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin?

958
01:42:18,084 --> 01:42:18,325
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

959
01:42:19,526 --> 01:42:20,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Mustone absent.

960
01:42:20,507 --> 01:42:21,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Rossell?

961
01:42:21,448 --> 01:42:21,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

962
01:42:21,748 --> 01:42:22,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor Longo?

963
01:42:42,018 --> 01:42:47,019
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, two good arguments.

964
01:42:51,941 --> 01:43:01,483
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm wondering if I could have a minute just to read it one more time.

965
01:43:03,564 --> 01:43:04,044
[SPEAKER_12]: The fourth time.

966
01:43:50,247 --> 01:44:00,353
[SPEAKER_12]: I would love a little bit more time to think about it and review what is being discussed in the health and the curriculum member Graham mentioned.

967
01:44:00,994 --> 01:44:02,675
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know if since this is not

968
01:44:03,629 --> 01:44:04,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Before it's not cool.

969
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:09,895
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not complete yet, so we can incorporate this there.

970
01:44:09,915 --> 01:44:14,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember, I'm sorry, Dr Edward Vincent.

971
01:44:15,261 --> 01:44:17,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I, I just wanted to say in.

972
01:44:19,246 --> 01:44:30,516
[SPEAKER_06]: With the work that's happening already on the other policies that it would be in our best interest just to have it one place, because based on the comments that were made earlier.

973
01:44:31,277 --> 01:44:35,741
[SPEAKER_06]: If we have certain portions of a policy listed multiple places.

974
01:44:36,542 --> 01:44:45,348
[SPEAKER_06]: The likelihood of having it be the exact same wording is when you just get into having policies that end up contradicting one another.

975
01:44:45,888 --> 01:44:49,771
[SPEAKER_06]: So I too am in support of striking those two sections.

976
01:44:50,211 --> 01:44:53,774
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a very robust dress code policy already in place.

977
01:44:54,714 --> 01:45:01,419
[SPEAKER_06]: And the health and wellness PE policy is actively being worked on right now that I think

978
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:05,301
[SPEAKER_06]: it doesn't need to be here.

979
01:45:05,501 --> 01:45:15,226
[SPEAKER_06]: And just based on our own past practice, whether it's phys ed and the sports, we already have teams on our football team.

980
01:45:15,266 --> 01:45:20,729
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have, you know, female students who have participated on the team as well.

981
01:45:21,269 --> 01:45:23,671
[SPEAKER_06]: And so MIAA works with the districts.

982
01:45:24,311 --> 01:45:27,132
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of feel like it's not necessary.

983
01:45:27,372 --> 01:45:28,053
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've made

984
01:45:29,645 --> 01:45:33,026
[SPEAKER_06]: substantive revisions thus far on the remaining sections.

985
01:45:33,626 --> 01:45:40,389
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just, you know, wanted to just add that as my two cents, but I defer to the committee.

986
01:45:44,010 --> 01:45:44,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Hayes.

987
01:45:47,291 --> 01:45:56,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess one thing I'd like some clarity on if I could is, so would there, would the wellness policy include a statement like this about, um,

988
01:45:57,925 --> 01:46:00,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean we're being asked to do that.

989
01:46:00,767 --> 01:46:01,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

990
01:46:01,168 --> 01:46:07,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I guess I'm also not clear why if we know that if we already know this policy exists, why can't it.

991
01:46:07,873 --> 01:46:10,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Why wouldn't it say the same thing in a newer policy.

992
01:46:10,495 --> 01:46:21,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Why wouldn't the, why wouldn't the committee just use the same wording, but, you know, so I'm a little confused by why there's some suggestion that it would conflict.

993
01:46:25,033 --> 01:46:26,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's not what happens today.

994
01:46:27,514 --> 01:46:38,757
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what happens in six months or a year when something gets reopened and it changes and it diverges and nobody realizes that there was something else that had to be done to keep them in line.

995
01:46:38,777 --> 01:46:47,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think aspirationally, those things should not be hard, but I don't think that as a district, that's where we are.

996
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:52,621
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that would be another concern of mine then though, if the wellness policy changes.

997
01:46:53,277 --> 01:46:58,261
[SPEAKER_01]: and this doesn't exist somewhere else and somehow this gets left out, then we have it nowhere anymore.

998
01:46:59,182 --> 01:47:11,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's where we have to trust that the members of the school committee who are elected by the city to represent students would not leave something like this on the cutting room floor in a policy revision.

999
01:47:12,913 --> 01:47:17,496
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I would likewise say we could trust that we could figure out how to make policies match.

1000
01:47:18,998 --> 01:47:20,679
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have no evidence that that's true.

1001
01:47:22,216 --> 01:47:25,717
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no evidence of either of the things that either of us are saying, quite frankly.

1002
01:47:26,337 --> 01:47:40,561
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I mean, we're already in the middle of a vote, but I feel strongly that this is a policy about gender identity and how the laws and the guidance from DESE, how we're going to apply that in our schools.

1003
01:47:41,081 --> 01:47:44,762
[SPEAKER_01]: And these two sections specify that.

1004
01:47:44,942 --> 01:47:51,564
[SPEAKER_01]: And for students who are specifically looking for that, they will look for this policy to see what their rights are.

1005
01:47:52,662 --> 01:47:58,751
[SPEAKER_01]: and if these things are not in this policy, they may or may not think to look in another place.

1006
01:47:59,993 --> 01:48:00,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor, may I?

1007
01:48:00,854 --> 01:48:02,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin.

1008
01:48:03,648 --> 01:48:15,315
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I would just also add, as both a communications professional and someone who works in the field, I would never think that less communication is better.

1009
01:48:15,335 --> 01:48:17,496
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that more communication is better.

1010
01:48:18,676 --> 01:48:21,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Duplicating information and communication is not a bad thing.

1011
01:48:21,418 --> 01:48:22,939
[SPEAKER_13]: It reinforces the policy.

1012
01:48:23,459 --> 01:48:24,940
[SPEAKER_13]: and reinforces that people know that.

1013
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:32,224
[SPEAKER_13]: If we're saying we can't count on ourselves to make sure that this policy is changed where it is effective in the other pieces, that is a different issue.

1014
01:48:32,644 --> 01:48:43,530
[SPEAKER_13]: That is something that we need to create some procedure around how our policies are actually implemented, which is part of going back to the chicken or the egg here that I just mentioned a little while ago.

1015
01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:47,212
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have any of that, which is part of the issue.

1016
01:48:47,732 --> 01:48:50,994
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it does bear repeating again because, you know,

1017
01:48:51,594 --> 01:49:00,279
[SPEAKER_13]: again, we can hope that people will know that it, you know, that they need to change it in one place, that, you know, if they leave it out on one place that, you know, they'll know to take it out on another if the vote was made.

1018
01:49:00,379 --> 01:49:00,939
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't know that.

1019
01:49:00,959 --> 01:49:01,980
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not happening in either way.

1020
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:02,680
[SPEAKER_13]: We all know that.

1021
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:09,023
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's no, there's no procedure around how policy is being included in this policy manual.

1022
01:49:11,044 --> 01:49:11,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor, point of order.

1023
01:49:13,686 --> 01:49:15,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of order, Member Rousseau.

1024
01:49:16,327 --> 01:49:18,428
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't deliberate after we have started voting.

1025
01:49:18,508 --> 01:49:20,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, the members who have already voted

1026
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:23,902
[SPEAKER_08]: lost their right to change their mind.

1027
01:49:24,463 --> 01:49:27,366
[SPEAKER_08]: So can we finish voting or?

1028
01:49:29,047 --> 01:49:31,169
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, I think that's our only option.

1029
01:49:31,469 --> 01:49:33,912
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think the full committee should decide on it.

1030
01:49:33,932 --> 01:49:42,780
[SPEAKER_12]: So I mean, I think that could be just one question we leave for the vote when it takes place on the floor, because we're going to obviously push this to

1031
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:48,141
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to table.

1032
01:49:48,701 --> 01:49:51,163
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there's already a roll call in place.

1033
01:49:51,203 --> 01:49:52,384
[SPEAKER_08]: You cannot motion in the middle.

1034
01:49:52,504 --> 01:49:54,846
[SPEAKER_08]: We cannot even deliberate in the middle of our roll call.

1035
01:50:00,510 --> 01:50:01,191
[SPEAKER_12]: Then, yes.

1036
01:50:02,051 --> 01:50:04,213
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's three in the affirmative, two in the negative.

1037
01:50:04,233 --> 01:50:05,494
[SPEAKER_12]: The motion passes.

1038
01:50:05,514 --> 01:50:11,899
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think there's any reason why we couldn't put this back in on the floor.

1039
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:14,601
[SPEAKER_12]: If the committee so chooses.

1040
01:50:18,339 --> 01:50:26,724
[SPEAKER_13]: point of order, or point of information actually so you're talking at the second reading that that people can put this in because that's not an option.

1041
01:50:27,585 --> 01:50:35,029
[SPEAKER_12]: We didn't take a first reading yet, there's going to take a first reading at the next school committee meeting, which it then

1042
01:50:36,150 --> 01:50:39,391
[SPEAKER_12]: this document will come forward and you can still make changes on the floor.

1043
01:50:39,571 --> 01:50:49,214
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pretty, we won't be spending two hours like we did tonight, but we can just add the dress code back in or after we all think about it in this full body of seven.

1044
01:50:54,096 --> 01:50:57,897
[SPEAKER_12]: Otherwise we have a, we've went through the whole policy over the last two hours.

1045
01:50:57,937 --> 01:50:59,257
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a good base.

1046
01:50:59,477 --> 01:51:01,998
[SPEAKER_12]: We just have that option of the last two.

1047
01:51:03,570 --> 01:51:03,730
[SPEAKER_12]: Um.

1048
01:51:04,892 --> 01:51:05,792
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Russo.

1049
01:51:06,613 --> 01:51:07,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mayor.

1050
01:51:07,814 --> 01:51:10,877
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing that I am.

1051
01:51:11,238 --> 01:51:19,726
[SPEAKER_08]: If I'd like to make a motion that the members allow me to reorganize this information section to fit with our current policy on the proper format.

1052
01:51:19,806 --> 01:51:20,627
[SPEAKER_08]: It's mostly good.

1053
01:51:20,647 --> 01:51:25,532
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, you know, like there's this M A s t. I think that means mass general laws.

1054
01:51:25,592 --> 01:51:26,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I don't know.

1055
01:51:27,394 --> 01:51:27,554
[SPEAKER_08]: But

1056
01:51:28,078 --> 01:51:37,561
[SPEAKER_08]: If the motion is to allow me to replace this section with a properly formatted, a more commonly formatted way that the school committee uses.

1057
01:51:38,421 --> 01:51:38,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

1058
01:51:39,761 --> 01:51:42,162
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Graham.

1059
01:51:42,182 --> 01:51:43,542
