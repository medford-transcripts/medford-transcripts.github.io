1
00:01:14,065 --> 00:01:15,307
What if we just, oh.

2
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:19,233
Do you guys mind if I check my sound?

3
00:01:19,273 --> 00:01:20,235
Can someone say hello?

4
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:20,295
Hi.

5
00:01:21,577 --> 00:01:22,358
Thank you, Paula.

6
00:01:22,778 --> 00:01:24,040
All right, the sound is working.

7
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,441
Great.

8
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:26,003
I have a lot of help here.

9
00:01:26,564 --> 00:01:27,606
Hello, everyone.

10
00:02:03,694 --> 00:02:04,374
Hi, Teagan.

11
00:02:15,897 --> 00:02:17,618
I think we're all overtired in our house.

12
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,598
We're all a little slap happy.

13
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:25,000
I have to say, everybody looks so tired already.

14
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:29,561
It's only Thursday.

15
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:30,361
What?

16
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:31,361
Who looks tired?

17
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:32,342
Everybody.

18
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:33,242
Not you.

19
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:42,012
All right, one, two, three.

20
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:43,273
Maybe it's just, I'm tired.

21
00:02:46,996 --> 00:02:48,017
Okay.

22
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:52,360
So we have tonight and tomorrow night, budget meeting seven to nine.

23
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:53,281
We will get started.

24
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:55,123

00:05:08,671 --> 00:05:10,072
If we could take the roll, please.

44
00:05:18,497 --> 00:05:19,957
Member McLaughlin, do you want me to take the roll?

45
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:22,739
You're muted, Melanie.

46
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:23,738
Oh, thank you.

47
00:05:23,818 --> 00:05:24,159
Sorry.

48
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:25,419
Member Graham.

49
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:26,400
Here.

50
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,980
Member Kratz.

51
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:28,861
Here.

52
00:05:28,881 --> 00:05:30,501
Member McLaughlin here.

53
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:31,302
Member McStone.

54
00:05:31,642 --> 00:05:31,882
Here.

55
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:33,163
Member Rousseau.

56
00:05:33,903 --> 00:05:34,103
Here.

57
00:05:34,823 --> 00:05:35,584
Member Van de Kloet.

58
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:36,164
Here.

59
00:05:36,744 --> 00:05:37,405
Mayor Longo Kern.

60
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:38,405
Present.

61
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,866
Seven present, zero absent.

62
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:49,110
I will leave it off, set it off to Mr. Murphy and Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent to start us off.

63
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:51,773
Good evening, everyone.

64
00:05:53,195 --> 00:05:56,420
We're in for another night of presentations.

65
00:05:57,361 --> 00:06:03,169
The team has worked incredibly hard and I want to just thank the departments that are presenting today.

66
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,254
We have mathematics,

67
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:12,917
athletics, English learners, and I believe technology.

68
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:21,821
So we have four departments, but we will follow a similar format as we've been following for the previous days.

69
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:38,945
And again, I just want to thank Dave and the finance team, Michelle Kingdon, and all of those who have been working incredibly hard to keep us on track with what's being presented tonight.

70
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:42,106
So Mr. Murphy, I'm passing the baton on to you.

71
00:06:42,126 --> 00:06:44,206
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vinson.

72
00:06:45,326 --> 00:06:49,507
So as the superintendent said, we'll be covering four areas tonight.

73
00:06:49,747 --> 00:06:51,748
Tonight is a bit of a segue for us where

74
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:54,251
If you can't hear you, I can't.

75
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,392
You can't hear me?

76
00:06:56,052 --> 00:07:00,896
Can you hear me now?

77
00:07:02,698 --> 00:07:03,398
It's very low.

78
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:06,020
What's that?

79
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:06,981
It's just low.

80
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:08,122
Really low.

81
00:07:10,124 --> 00:07:13,627
It's so low that it's not bringing you up as the featured speaker.

82
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:16,269
How about now?

83
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:16,929
Can you hear me now?

84
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,010
Yes, we can.

85
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:20,292
This is better?

86
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:21,173
Yes.

87
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,571
I was asked to try a different background.

88
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,112
Didn't work out.

89
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:31,374
So for those who are getting sick and tired of the angle of that camera, I apologize.

90
00:07:31,394 --> 00:07:33,015
You'll have to live with this one.

91
00:07:33,155 --> 00:07:38,137
And Peter, if there's any way you can make it so I can see myself, that would probably lead to a smoother presentation.

92
00:07:38,997 --> 00:07:47,201
So as the superintendent said, today we'll be focused on mathematics, technology, athletics, and English learners.

93
00:07:47,981 --> 00:07:51,202
We are, in some respects, finishing up on the presentation

94
00:07:53,485 --> 00:08:03,955
from May 13, where we heard from humanities, science, world languages, fine arts, and somebody else, I think.

95
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:07,758
I think it was somebody else.

96
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,862
And so today, oh, health and PE.

97
00:08:12,523 --> 00:08:13,344
Apologies to Ms.

98
00:08:13,364 --> 00:08:13,604
Perry.

99
00:08:14,645 --> 00:08:18,969
And so today, we'll be finishing up the academic content areas

100
00:08:19,554 --> 00:08:33,657
And also, this is really sort of step one of three in finishing up this phase of the presentations leading to the superintendent's recommendations that will go to the superintendent for a vote, which will be the request that goes to the municipal government.

101
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:44,340
So as we have with each of the presentations that we've made before, and again, this is presentation number four.

102
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:48,236
We will run through the process that we're at.

103
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,896
As we know, there'll be members of the community who will be watching this.

104
00:08:51,956 --> 00:08:56,157
And sometimes this is the first budget committee of the whole that they're seeing.

105
00:08:56,197 --> 00:09:09,681
And so in order to give everyone appropriate context, with apologies to people who have watched each one, and I know this seems somewhat repetitive and redundant, we want to make sure that everyone has appropriate context.

106
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:15,022
So this is the budget process as a whole from start to finish, beginning with the development of the district's

107
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:23,976
strategic goals and priorities that lead to meetings that are held internally, administrative meetings that develop those budgetary priorities.

108
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:31,562
You'll be hearing from the directors tonight with regard to some of their specific suggestions and points of emphasis.

109
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:42,530
This is the place within the sequence that we're in right now, the development of the superintendent's recommendation leading up to a statutorily required budget hearing, which will take place on June 1st.

110
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:49,871
This is our organizational chart, and as we've discussed before, we show this for the community's benefit to see.

111
00:09:49,911 --> 00:09:56,294
This is how the Medford Public Schools are organized in the various offices, reporting to the superintendent.

112
00:09:56,774 --> 00:10:01,996
And then, as we did in the previous ones, these are the areas that we will be discussing tonight.

113
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:13,061
As we've said before, the funding and the operating budget for the Medford Public Schools generally comes from two sources, traditionally, two main sources.

114
00:10:13,677 --> 00:10:19,080
the chapter 70 allocation that comes from the state and the local contribution from the municipal government.

115
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:31,927
There's also external funds that come in each year, things like the IDEA special education grant, Perkins grant, a variety of other external funds, titles one, three, four, things of that nature.

116
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:43,433
This year, we've added that column on the far right because of the significant influx of federal dollars as a result of the COVID-19 related legislation that's passed over the course of the last year.

117
00:10:45,388 --> 00:10:54,735
As we've developed our budgetary priorities, we've focused primarily on three general areas, personnel and staffing, which is always going to be the bulk of this budget and any other budget in a school system.

118
00:10:55,396 --> 00:11:01,340
Materials and infrastructure, what are the supplies and the sort of hardware that our school communities are in need of.

119
00:11:01,781 --> 00:11:11,448
And training and professional development, specifically within the context of identifying how do we best repair and rebuild from the instructional disruption that's taken place over the course of the last two years.

120
00:11:12,081 --> 00:11:39,798
So to that end, each of our directors and principals were asked, as part of the budget development process that referenced a moment ago, to look at these areas and to think through what are the most strategic, targeted, and intensive interventions that we can apply in the short term to try to bring about as much remedial support as is possible and also put our students back into as good of a position, if not better, than they were prior to that disruption.

121
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:42,340
And so we look at strategic staffing opportunities.

122
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:59,765
We look at what are the programs that perhaps we were able to fund as a result of CARES Act funding and other external funding opportunities that came in as a result of the pandemic, and what are the best practices that we've been able to identify that we want to systematize and eventually incorporate into our operating budget.

123
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:06,667
As we said, as far back as April 26, when we look at our

124
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:36,434
priorities in total, understanding that there are a number of variables, including things like specific restrictions on some of that federal funding coming in and what it can be used for and what it can't, keeping in mind the one-time nature of that funding and not wanting to create structural deficits that will put the district toward a fiscal cliff when the federal money runs out, and also understanding that we have upwards of nine collective bargaining agreements that are expiring this year, and those negotiations will be starting soon

125
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:49,382
So understand that we've got those variables that lead to a lot of unanswered questions and a lot of anxiousness on our part, trying to make sure that we build a budget that is sensible and that takes into account all of those contextual factors.

126
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:56,263
Our projections are that we're looking at somewhere between a $3.4 and $5.8 million increase.

127
00:12:56,283 --> 00:13:00,364
And so that takes into account our $2.1 million worth of fixed costs.

128
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:04,585
I will say that in the last week, some of our estimates have suggested that that

129
00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:07,606
We could be exceeding that with respect to fixed costs.

130
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:12,367
Much of that is attributable to special education fixed costs.

131
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:29,270
And as we discussed on May 6th when our Office of Pupil Services presented, we know that there are a number of factors that go into budgeting in the special education context in that realm, including a large amount of external funding that will come in and will offset

132
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:31,108
a lot of those expenses.

133
00:13:31,148 --> 00:13:46,342
And so that's not necessarily a reason to panic, but it is, I think it's worth noting anecdotally that this is why these numbers, these numbers are fluid and why it's, it's hard to sort of pinpoint and say, this is exactly how much it will cost to operate the method public schools next year.

134
00:13:46,362 --> 00:13:50,967
But generally speaking, we still feel pretty confident about that range of 3.4 to $5.8 million.

135
00:13:55,027 --> 00:14:00,810
This year, one of the defining characteristics of the year has been the ESSER funding and the CARES Act funding.

136
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:10,734
We also have a limited amount of ESSER I funding still remaining that we will need to expend prior to the conclusion of fiscal year 2021.

137
00:14:12,115 --> 00:14:19,778
The ESSER funds that we're looking at next year, ESSER II and ESSER III amount to approximately $7.6 million, and these are, generally speaking,

138
00:14:21,973 --> 00:14:31,139
uses that we're expecting based on the guidance that we have related to ESSER II, and our expectation that ESSER III funding will, in many respects, be an extension of that.

139
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:38,625
Okay, so now we'll get into a slightly different format than we've used before for these four categories.

140
00:14:39,205 --> 00:14:50,853
Joining us tonight are Faiza Khan, our Director of Mathematics, Paul Teixeira, Director of English Learners, Alan Arena, and Molly Laden are representing our technology group, and I'll talk a little bit about the structure of that technology group.

141
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:54,853
when we move into the technology realm.

142
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:59,975
And Bobby Maloney is here to represent athletics and community schools to talk about our priorities.

143
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:06,256
So this is a slightly simplified version of the format that we've presented these priorities in before.

144
00:15:06,977 --> 00:15:10,898
That is in part because you've seen this presentation three or four times now.

145
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:18,700
And for purposes of efficiency and expediency, I think this might be a slightly more efficient way to do it.

146
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:27,525
The one piece of information that is not included in the slides that are before you, but is included in the documentation that the school committee was provided today.

147
00:15:27,965 --> 00:15:36,207
And that can be a basis for discussion both tonight, tomorrow night, when we reconvene, as well as our budget update that will take place on Monday.

148
00:15:36,427 --> 00:15:39,128
If you're regularly reading on May 24th, there'll be a budget update.

149
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:44,329
And so I recognize some of the documents you didn't receive until late today.

150
00:15:44,849 --> 00:15:46,630
And again, we'll have the discussion.

151
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,830
We'll hear from the directors tonight.

152
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:57,977
If anyone has conversation that is emanating out of review of that, of those documents, we're happy to take that up tonight, tomorrow, and on Monday.

153
00:15:57,997 --> 00:16:00,779
So you'll have ample time to discuss that in this forum.

154
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:09,105
The one piece that's not in these slides that was in the previous ones are the long-term budgetary priorities.

155
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:15,830
I think that had led to some confusion in our conversation a few times over the last couple of committees, committee of the whole meetings.

156
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:26,316
The administration is not recommending that those long-term priorities are incorporated into FY22, into the operating budget.

157
00:16:26,356 --> 00:16:35,057
They are things that we want the community and the school committee to know about because we feel that they are important and they're strategic priorities that in time the district does need to pursue.

158
00:16:35,477 --> 00:16:44,139
But when we look at that $3.4 to $5.8 million projected range with regard to increased costs, those are not including the pieces that

159
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:55,891
we think are important enough to talk about, we think it's critical that they be on the school committee and the community's radar, but they're not necessarily something that we think is necessary or prudent to pursue in fiscal year 2022.

160
00:16:57,352 --> 00:17:10,303
However, as I said, if looking through those documents, you see anything that you'd like to ask about, the many members of the senior leadership team, as well as the directors that will be speaking before you tonight, we'll be happy to expand upon those.

161
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:17,266
and to explain the rationale as to why they landed in the category of long-term priority versus FY22 priority.

162
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:33,338
So mathematics and English learners, my hope is as you look through these budgetary priorities, that similar to what seemed to be the case in our discussions related to all of the other departments and offices who have already presented, that you'll see some common threads.

163
00:17:33,778 --> 00:17:38,442
Again, these are priorities that were developed by asking practitioners, what are the things that

164
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:49,588
will be most useful and most impactful with respect to rebuilding and restoring the position that students were in.

165
00:17:50,088 --> 00:17:57,332
And then also capitalizing on what we've learned as a result of the disruption that has occurred over the course of the past two years.

166
00:17:57,753 --> 00:18:05,257
So in some cases, as you see, and as we've done in the past, the green check marks indicate these are budgetary priorities that have already been

167
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:10,559
endorsed by the school committee via your votes in the previous presentations.

168
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:16,603
And that is true for the restoration of the math interventionist positions at the middle school level.

169
00:18:17,104 --> 00:18:20,146
And that might be a good jumping off point for this conversation.

170
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:20,946
Ms.

171
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:32,035
Kahn, if you would like to perhaps speak about the implications of those restoration of the math interventionist positions at the McGlynn and the Andrews Middle School and why

172
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:39,901
Those were identified both by the school principal, yourself and the administration with respect to their importance and their impact on students.

173
00:18:41,022 --> 00:18:41,202
Yes.

174
00:18:41,362 --> 00:18:42,463
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

175
00:18:42,543 --> 00:18:48,345
Thank you, school committee members for your time tonight.

176
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:56,049
I can definitely speak to having one math intervention at each of the middle schools.

177
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,751
I have been

178
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:13,481
doing a lot of research and reaching out to the other districts to see how they are mitigating the impact of COVID-19, the challenging times that we have had.

179
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:20,127
And this is one piece that almost every place has

180
00:19:21,248 --> 00:19:25,411
put in place, whether it's through ESSER funding or through other means.

181
00:19:26,651 --> 00:19:41,140
I feel like this is going to have a big impact on our student success because they work with small groups, they work with identified small groups, and these interventionists are trained.

182
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:49,285
They either have a lot of experience in the field or they have taken a lot of professional development to

183
00:19:50,666 --> 00:20:04,343
to be able to identify and they know how to identify where the gaps are and then they, you know, apply those strategies so that students are given

184
00:20:06,585 --> 00:20:14,490
the right kind of help at the right time with the concepts where the gaps are.

185
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:29,360
So I personally believe, I professionally believe that these two positions, one at each school will play an important role in bringing equity to our students in mathematics specifically.

186
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:31,061
Thank you, Ms.

187
00:20:31,101 --> 00:20:31,461
Khan.

188
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:35,604
My hope would be, as I said, I hope that for those who've been watching this,

189
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:56,509
process play out over the course of the last several weeks that you'll see, again, consistency both from a thematic perspective and from a tactical perspective that it's been heartening for myself and for others involved in the process of developing this budget to see the extent to which there's a consensus behind several of these priorities.

190
00:20:58,771 --> 00:21:00,673
And I think that recognizing

191
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:08,990
that there could be a broad consensus, but sometimes it's just a matter of budgetary capacity and things that we're not able to pursue.

192
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:30,207
But in this case, particularly if it turns out that some of the external funding is earmarked, as it may well be, or functionally earmarked, at least, for the restoration of budgetary items that were eliminated in the wake of the pandemic, these positions are certainly ripe for consideration with respect to that.

193
00:21:31,153 --> 00:21:47,540
At the elementary level, you may recall that during the elementary presentation on May 3, there was discussion with respect to some of the math curriculum and some of the strategic decisions that were going into items being either piloted or procured for fiscal year 22.

194
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,642
And this is, frankly, there's both an organizational component of this, of the envisions

195
00:21:53,265 --> 00:21:56,087
our program and the procurement of that, that I'm gonna ask Ms.

196
00:21:56,127 --> 00:21:58,728
Kahn to speak about in a minute to talk about the implications of that.

197
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:07,333
But in addition to the sort of organizational decision as to where to make that investment, there was also strategic decisions as to how and where to budget this.

198
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:18,980
And given the district-wide, or at least at the elementary level, district-wide impact of this program, we felt that the math department was the appropriate place to budget for it.

199
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,401
And then through a collaboration with Ms.

200
00:22:21,421 --> 00:22:22,462
Galussi and Ms.

201
00:22:22,502 --> 00:22:22,762
Kahn,

202
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:31,504
we've identified a way in which this is an investment we can make at a more efficiently.

203
00:22:31,564 --> 00:22:33,245
And so Ms.

204
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:33,745
Khan, if Ms.

205
00:22:33,765 --> 00:22:41,889
Khan would like to speak to that as to what that means for the elementary schools and how her creative thinking positioned us to save 25,000, I think that might interest the committee.

206
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:42,895
Thank you.

207
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:45,539
So I'm happy to do so.

208
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,886
As we all know, we have been using Envisions 2015.

209
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,490
That's what the program is called.

210
00:22:54,091 --> 00:22:56,715
However, we incorporated it in the 2014-2015 year.

211
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,699
in Medford Public Schools.

212
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:07,163
It was up for renewal last year in June, that is June, 2020.

213
00:23:08,384 --> 00:23:27,355
We had to renew it because our committee, our elementary program implementation and review committee had started working since October of 2019, but it had not come to a conclusion as to which particular programs to choose and which ones to pilot.

214
00:23:28,335 --> 00:23:49,685
We had developed a rubric, and if our school committee members recall, and the community members recall, I had given an outline of the timeframe in April, in my April meeting, and also at a subcommittee meeting, curriculum subcommittee meeting in December.

215
00:23:50,745 --> 00:23:55,588
So we are currently in the process of looking at different programs.

216
00:23:56,209 --> 00:24:01,111
The committee is listening to presentations by different publishers.

217
00:24:01,992 --> 00:24:15,320
So it seems imperative that we will be renewing envisions for one more year while our teachers, not all of them, but the committee members will be piloting programs

218
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:25,065
through all four elementary schools and so the envisions program that we have used for years now.

219
00:24:26,285 --> 00:24:36,670
I would like to mention that it is the program that we have been using is envisions 2015 and there's a new version of it that's out it's envisions 2020.

220
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:52,723
Last year we used the online version of 2020 because we were given that version free of charge when we renewed the program, the envisions 2015 program, the paper and the online version.

221
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:57,847
Because that was if we would have gone for the paper version of 2020

222
00:24:59,148 --> 00:25:09,417
that would have caused us a lot of, a lot of our teachers would have to learn a slightly different program on a very short notice.

223
00:25:09,857 --> 00:25:18,744
So we continued that and this year when we are looking at different options, it seems like envisions

224
00:25:20,545 --> 00:25:34,372
2020, the online version, is a better way to go because Envisions 2015 is so outdated that it's not being offered in the full capacity.

225
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:35,533
So Ms.

226
00:25:35,553 --> 00:25:45,958
Galussi and I have talked, and it seems like we will be moving forward with renewing the program, but not the Envisions 2015 version, but Envisions 2020 version.

227
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,501
I think many teachers have gotten a chance to get their feet wet with the program.

228
00:25:55,022 --> 00:26:00,023
It's just that the paper version that we will be getting this year will be envisions 2020.

229
00:26:01,183 --> 00:26:06,885
And I am gonna take a very close look at it to see what the alignment is.

230
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:12,947
But the envisions 2020 is much more in line with the frameworks which came out in 2017.

231
00:26:14,527 --> 00:26:17,008
as compared to its counterpart.

232
00:26:17,568 --> 00:26:27,693
So that's where we will be saving the money because our older program was much more expensive and this version is coming to us cheaper.

233
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:28,433
Thank you.

234
00:26:28,873 --> 00:26:29,354
Thank you, Ms.

235
00:26:29,374 --> 00:26:29,574
Khan.

236
00:26:29,614 --> 00:26:43,260
So before we move on to our English Learner Department and Mr. Teixeira, again, I want to point out the sort of common threads that connect the budgetary priorities and what I hope and believe to be

237
00:26:43,891 --> 00:26:46,272
both a coherent and coordinated manner.

238
00:26:46,312 --> 00:26:56,978
And so if you see the final two bullets there about the extended day program and the summer learning program, that is, it's consistent with what you've seen from other departments.

239
00:26:57,459 --> 00:27:12,547
And what we as an organization are currently focused on is developing right now immediately summer programming that will in all likelihood be funded largely through the ESSER funding to add additional intensive intervention opportunities

240
00:27:13,062 --> 00:27:27,609
to give students both academic opportunities for purposes of remedial support, and then just as, and perhaps more importantly, social and emotional supports to help reacclimate students to the school environment.

241
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:39,095
And so you'll essentially see that in just about every department that we're looking at how do we develop programs that give each department, each area of our educational program the opportunity

242
00:27:39,775 --> 00:27:48,142
to connect with students to give them the opportunity to again become reacclimated and familiarize themselves with the learning opportunities that are represented by our various departments.

243
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:49,563
And so just briefly, Ms.

244
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:57,610
Kahn, if you wanted to touch upon the summer program that's in development and then the importance of looking at

245
00:27:58,192 --> 00:28:09,735
various extended school day initiatives that, again, we will be looking at from a district perspective and how do we coordinate that and make sure that there is opportunity for all of the content areas to be involved in that.

246
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:16,717
But just with respect to the importance of doing that for purposes of rebuilding post pandemic.

247
00:28:17,637 --> 00:28:18,318
Absolutely.

248
00:28:18,578 --> 00:28:18,998
Thank you.

249
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:42,942
I proposed this week long four hour each day math academy at each grade level from six through 12, because I noticed that there are some gaps that are very basic and that they can be filled, you know, via smaller projects, via certain

250
00:28:44,024 --> 00:28:49,125
you know, in-person games and, you know, very hands-on activities.

251
00:28:49,785 --> 00:28:58,447
And I know our students have been at home, you know, Zooming in, day in and day out for a very long period of time.

252
00:28:58,948 --> 00:29:04,449
So I am hoping to run this four hour each day Math Academy six through 12.

253
00:29:05,689 --> 00:29:11,572
so that students don't just learn math via worksheets or just via looking at the screen.

254
00:29:11,612 --> 00:29:13,573
This will be in person.

255
00:29:13,653 --> 00:29:33,882
So the students will actually come in and learn math through engaging activities that will be taken for a six to eight level from illustrative mathematics itself and through Engage New York or illustrative mathematics for nine through 12.

256
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:36,331
that we're going to be able to address.

257
00:29:36,351 --> 00:29:38,012
Uh 12 or 9 to 11 as need be.

258
00:29:39,192 --> 00:29:48,514
Great And so, um, just to just to wrap up mathematics, and I think if it's okay with you, Mayor, I think we'll go through the four department areas and take questions.

259
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:57,016
Um and mass after that, but, um, you'll notice in the documents that the school community has and it will have be on our website after tonight.

260
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:57,956
The long term

261
00:30:03,944 --> 00:30:16,028
the need to eventually incorporate or reincorporate, I guess, math coaches into our departmental structure and looking at math and prevention specialists at the elementary schools.

262
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:23,290
Those are two things with an estimated price tag of a half million dollars that the district absolutely believes to be important.

263
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:30,832
But just in terms of measuring potential impact and looking at the sequence of how these priorities get pursued,

264
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:42,218
the literacy intervention at the elementary school and the math and literacy intervention specialists at the middle school essentially just came out on top and looking at what was it that was most important right now.

265
00:30:42,598 --> 00:30:58,743
That's not to say that if we find ourselves in a favorable financial position, it may well be the case that we would look to retain one math coach theoretically at the elementary level to start building out that capacity so that when the funding capacity is there,

266
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:03,294
we're better positioned to retain that type of personnel.

267
00:31:03,354 --> 00:31:11,076
But for right now, those priorities live in the long-term priorities as opposed to the FY22 recommendations.

268
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,077
So thank you, Ms.

269
00:31:13,117 --> 00:31:13,477
Khan.

270
00:31:13,577 --> 00:31:21,639
I want to turn now to Mr. Teixeira, who is providing study leadership, as always, in the English Learner Department.

271
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:28,581
And one of the key substantive priorities there is with respect to the Imagine Learning program that

272
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:35,010
Mr. Teixeira can discuss in greater detail than I can, so I'm asking him to do that at this time.

273
00:31:36,332 --> 00:31:37,834
Good evening, everyone.

274
00:31:38,655 --> 00:31:40,277
Thank you for your time this evening.

275
00:31:41,707 --> 00:31:52,351
With regard to Imagine Learning, we used $5,000 of the CARES Act money last year to pilot test this with our newcomer students in grades six through 12.

276
00:31:53,672 --> 00:31:55,692
And it was hugely successful.

277
00:31:56,533 --> 00:32:00,774
The teachers liked it, the students liked it, the teachers reported progress.

278
00:32:01,315 --> 00:32:10,318
It's an adaptive literacy program specifically geared toward English learners that gives frequent formative assessment along the way.

279
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:26,864
So the teachers can not only, it's a standalone program, but the teachers can use this data to incorporate the skillset into their instruction because of the vast formative assessments that are provided on a regular basis.

280
00:32:27,124 --> 00:32:38,009
And so what I'm looking to do is increase that to expand it to some level three and four students, as well as bring it down to fourth and fifth grade.

281
00:32:38,643 --> 00:32:47,708
I don't think we need it with primary grades because we do have Lexia for the K one and two and Going from there.

282
00:32:47,728 --> 00:32:53,471
And I believe three is also using Lexia stop me if I'm not correct on that.

283
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:55,532
And then, um,

284
00:32:56,396 --> 00:32:58,919
In terms of staffing I'm remaining level funded.

285
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:09,050
We did add a position last year to the high school, which was critical this year, because even though our overall numbers are low.

286
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:14,954
because of border closings and COVID, the numbers at the high school continue to grow.

287
00:33:15,274 --> 00:33:19,397
So that position was desperately needed at the high school.

288
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:30,146
Given how things may change in the next coming year, I believe we're adequately staffed to support any new students coming into the district.

289
00:33:32,232 --> 00:33:49,699
With regard to any additional expenses, I was looking to restore my textbook budget back to the funding from two years ago, which would be a $7,000 increase because of the changes in the US in the history curriculum at the high school.

290
00:33:49,719 --> 00:33:55,741
I do need to purchase textbooks for our level one and two students who would be taking

291
00:33:57,048 --> 00:34:16,990
uh history uh as a as opposed to because world history got is combined into one class now u.s one and two are now separated typically we didn't offer u.s history for our newcomer students because of the trajectory that the students follow would be in year one they would take world one

292
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,211
year two they would take world two.

293
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:23,213
In year three they could be in a mainstream history class.

294
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:31,738
All of the history teachers are SEI endorsed and they're typically level three students going into those history classes so you wouldn't need a separate program for that.

295
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:42,124
Now with the changes we do need the separate history program which means we would need we'd follow the same curriculum but we would need a textbook that would be a little bit different from what the mainstream uses.

296
00:34:43,145 --> 00:34:45,967
And other than that everything else is staying the same.

297
00:34:47,603 --> 00:34:48,183
Thank you, Paul.

298
00:34:49,724 --> 00:35:16,596
So as we move on to our technology area before wrapping up with athletics, the committee knows, of course, that in our technology department or departments consists of our instructional technology group led by Molly Layden and our operational technology, I'm going to say group, although the group is largely represented by Alan here on the call with occasional support lent from other departments.

299
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,242
on focusing on our network infrastructure.

300
00:35:20,342 --> 00:35:35,872
And you'll see in the budget narratives that have been provided to you that a large portion of the budgetary priorities on the operational side are likely to be pursued as capital improvement priorities as a way of staying off the operating budget.

301
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:44,278
There are a number of other annual costs and essentially costs that I think could accurately be described as

302
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:49,692
technological deferred maintenance that will need to be addressed in time.

303
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:52,014
And Mr. Arena can speak to that in a moment.

304
00:35:52,054 --> 00:36:11,108
But first, on the instructional side, one of the pieces that we heard in meeting with our elementary staff was the need to look at a few specific pieces of technology that did not benefit from the very substantial investment that the district made as part of the CARES Act funding.

305
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:30,414
You'll recall that we spent upwards of, in the vicinity of $2.5 million toward instructional technology as a result of the CARES Act funding, procured a large supply of Chromebooks that will keep us at essentially a one-to-one level for the next couple of years at least.

306
00:36:31,134 --> 00:36:37,436
We were also able to procure things, assistive technology and adaptive technology that are used in the classroom, like microphones and headsets

307
00:36:38,224 --> 00:36:39,565
a variety of pieces like that.

308
00:36:40,085 --> 00:36:43,427
The projectors, I think it's fair to say, and Ms.

309
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:51,032
Layden, you can certainly characterize this yourself, but they were sort of the piece that we didn't quite get to in this round of investment in FY21.

310
00:36:51,852 --> 00:37:04,620
And so projectors, and then as a result of that question, the question becomes, if we're going to go back and to address the classroom projector issue, is there a more optimal technology that we should be looking at instead?

311
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,080
And so Ms.

312
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,021
Layden has raised the issue

313
00:37:06,698 --> 00:37:09,822
perhaps moving toward the exploration of smart panels.

314
00:37:09,882 --> 00:37:25,420
And so, Molly, could you maybe take it from there and talk a little bit about those specific priorities and how we think that might bridge some of the gaps that for all the investment we did make that wasn't necessarily included in this in the past round of multi-million dollar spending on instructional tech.

315
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:51,324
sure uh good evening um yes as you know we we did have substantial technology investments over the last year um and then some of the things that we're looking at in terms of uh what's in the current budget is really going back to or going forward to after pandemic and so as everyone is back in the classroom and the libraries are open and so this department is library media and technology and so one of the

316
00:37:52,195 --> 00:38:08,563
items we're looking to do is expand our library opening hours, which is actually increasing the paraprofessional support so that we are open as principals have requested both before and after school, which right now our libraries are staffed during school hours.

317
00:38:08,663 --> 00:38:11,344
And so there's been a request for additional hours.

318
00:38:11,404 --> 00:38:15,486
So we're looking at expanding those paraprofessional support.

319
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:19,801
the projectors that Mr. Murphy was just referring to.

320
00:38:19,921 --> 00:38:32,190
So we're actually just in a continuous role of replacing projectors or projector bulbs, and those projectors primarily were installed in our 2012 bond.

321
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:38,594
And so we've certainly been replacing a lot over the years, but we're really hitting the end of life for a lot of them.

322
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:44,318
And so as we look to be replacing these at $1,000 a pop or $600 a pop, depending on which,

323
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,621
type of projector in which kind of room.

324
00:38:49,261 --> 00:38:59,007
We're looking at a more current technology that may save us from doing this constant replacement and then replacing bulbs and mounting interactive panels.

325
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,148
And so we've been doing some exploration of that.

326
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:07,111
It's a more significant investment and installation, but in the long term, it's just a more current technology.

327
00:39:07,171 --> 00:39:11,714
These projectors are continuously being replaced by one model after another.

328
00:39:11,754 --> 00:39:14,875
So we're trying to keep up with the supplies for those and supporting those.

329
00:39:14,915 --> 00:39:15,456
And so it's a,

330
00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:23,596
an area that we did not look to do during the last year because most of our classrooms did not get occupied until later in the in the pandemic.

331
00:39:24,216 --> 00:39:31,000
So that's the projector interactive panel technology decisions that we're looking at making over the course of the upcoming year.

332
00:39:31,801 --> 00:39:32,281
We are

333
00:39:32,992 --> 00:39:44,355
well endowed at this point with a lot of devices, from Chromebooks to laptops for staff to assistive technology, as Mr. Murphy mentioned.

334
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,776
We do have a remaining group of 2012 Windows 7 desktops that

335
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:54,271
we are looking to get rid of and replace.

336
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:57,033
So we have not finalized that removal.

337
00:39:57,113 --> 00:40:04,379
Some of those will go because we don't need them in terms of open labs as students have Chromebooks on a one-to-one basis.

338
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,364
And teachers won't necessarily need them because they have new devices that will be instructional devices.

339
00:40:10,464 --> 00:40:16,129
But we do have a fair amount of other device, Windows 7 desktops that we're hoping to remove from play.

340
00:40:17,634 --> 00:40:19,915
We do have a need for website support.

341
00:40:19,975 --> 00:40:21,956
We have not had that essentially in a year.

342
00:40:22,036 --> 00:40:26,238
So there's been a lot of people filling that hole, but we don't have a webmaster.

343
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:38,465
And certainly beyond just getting things posted, we do need to maintain the site and continue to check the backend and to make sure it's supported and it's secure and it's still working and it makes sense.

344
00:40:39,372 --> 00:40:41,133
a logical place to find information.

345
00:40:41,253 --> 00:40:44,855
So that's something that we're looking at moving forward with.

346
00:40:45,136 --> 00:40:50,079
As we certainly increased our technology, we have also increased our need for additional tech support.

347
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,941
We have a lot that has been happening with very few staff.

348
00:40:53,981 --> 00:40:56,423
And so we really do want to be able to be more responsive.

349
00:40:56,563 --> 00:41:05,849
And as we have essentially one-to-one and addition of things like everything from document cameras to hopefully interactive panels to, you know,

350
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:12,712
webcams, do all sorts of things that are now in the hands of our staff and students that were not before.

351
00:41:12,752 --> 00:41:15,474
We really could use additional technical support.

352
00:41:15,494 --> 00:41:21,678
We've been working, well, shorthanded this year, but in general for the last two years with two people.

353
00:41:22,058 --> 00:41:25,060
And then one is supporting, hopefully supporting network part of the time.

354
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,403
And so we really could use additional technical support.

355
00:41:28,963 --> 00:41:36,188
And we have two technology teaching labs that have not yet been updated since that initial 2012

356
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:44,762
time, and the two that are remaining are the Brooks Elementary School and the Columbus Elementary School, and that was planned to happen this year.

357
00:41:45,763 --> 00:41:57,708
All the other instructional teaching labs have been updated to higher level machines to be able to do more that we are now asking students to do in those labs beyond the need of a Chromebook.

358
00:41:57,728 --> 00:41:58,709
This really can do more.

359
00:41:59,472 --> 00:42:06,217
We have two remaining labs that we hope to do, if not before the end of this year, then soon after that, so before the new school year opens.

360
00:42:06,577 --> 00:42:09,439
So all technology teaching labs will be updated.

361
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:18,405
And then the extended school day program, I think that Mr. Murphy, you may be able to address that more if that's part of another initiative as well.

362
00:42:18,785 --> 00:42:25,710
Yeah, and then just similar to what we mentioned, I think, in the math presentation, and maybe Yale as well, and the committee's heard this a few times over that,

363
00:42:26,649 --> 00:42:50,014
When we think about how do we build back in the wake of the pandemic, we're looking to see what are all the variables that we have some degree of control over and the use of time, the use of time of the year are the two things that come to mind or are really at the top of that list that we have to be thinking in a more flexible way about what constitutes the school year and what constitutes the school day.

364
00:42:50,514 --> 00:42:55,275
And so that's why you're hearing a lot about potential summer programming as well as extended school day.

365
00:42:55,685 --> 00:43:13,388
And when we talk about the extended school day, similar to when we were talking about world languages and fine arts, while there is an emphasis on mathematics and literacy for reasons particularly at the younger grades that are somewhat self-evident, there's also a need for robust engagement.

366
00:43:13,968 --> 00:43:22,270
And there is a population of students who will better engage from a literacy and math perspective if we're able to give an array of programming opportunities.

367
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:25,150
And that's why we're looking throughout for each department

368
00:43:25,717 --> 00:43:33,860
to see how best to engage students and position them to have success both during the school day and after the school day.

369
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:37,862
So that's a good overview.

370
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:45,264
Mr. Arena has sort of the second half of the technology piece that's represented more of the documents that you've received previously as opposed to this.

371
00:43:45,585 --> 00:43:54,028
The reason being, many of them are capital-related projects, although there are some, as I said, renewals and some other pieces that we'll have to take a look at.

372
00:43:54,967 --> 00:44:16,834
My sense from sort of reviewing previous budget presentations is that sometimes Mr. Arena's area has sort of been folded into other departments and I thought it was important for the committee to hear about the operational side of the ledger as well, in part because if the operations are not running smoothly, as everyone knows, we can't get to the place where we'll be able to provide high quality instruction.

373
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:21,476
And so just because there's a long list, as the committee knows,

374
00:44:22,087 --> 00:44:26,550
of operational matters that will have to be addressed in time on the infrastructure side.

375
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:45,182
Alan, if you wanted to just talk briefly about the importance of securing our networks and making sure that we have the appropriate archiving and other systems that are in place so that should we face a failure of some kind, we're able to restore the system as efficiently and quickly as possible.

376
00:44:46,085 --> 00:44:48,326
we don't run the risk of content being lost.

377
00:44:49,186 --> 00:45:02,329
I recognize that's one piece of a larger sort of systems approach that we need to take on the technology infrastructure side, but that might be just a good illustration of some of the work that needs to take place before we move on to hear from Mr. Mullaney in athletics.

378
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:08,191
Do I have to unmute, Mr. Arena?

379
00:45:09,511 --> 00:45:10,832
I might be able to do it myself.

380
00:45:12,712 --> 00:45:14,313
Dr. Cushing, are you able to unmute Alan?

381
00:45:15,886 --> 00:45:16,707
Yeah, I can do it too.

382
00:45:16,727 --> 00:45:23,853
There you go, Mr. Arena.

383
00:45:23,993 --> 00:45:36,284
I can tell you that from, although Dave has appropriately combed out those types of expenditures that have to occur because the subscription based and therefore, if you don't pay for those, then they shut the subscriptions down.

384
00:45:37,345 --> 00:45:39,887
But in addition to that, we have from a,

385
00:45:41,023 --> 00:45:51,532
disaster recovery standpoint, most of the network is running off of virtual servers and they pretty much run everything that's going on in the technology world.

386
00:45:51,552 --> 00:45:56,956
People wouldn't be able to log on, get out to the internet, store data, all those good things.

387
00:45:58,258 --> 00:46:04,603
And unfortunately, because of the age of the devices, these things are well past their mean time before failure.

388
00:46:04,663 --> 00:46:06,465
In fact, many of them have already

389
00:46:08,343 --> 00:46:12,564
started to fail, and unfortunately, we can't get replacement hardware or support for these.

390
00:46:13,365 --> 00:46:25,949
So those are the types of things that we're looking to get refunded for next year so that in the event that we ever have to initiate a disaster recovery, we have been set up in such a fashion as to guarantee that.

391
00:46:26,729 --> 00:46:29,530
We're doing some backups now.

392
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:33,351
Unfortunately, it's with independent devices.

393
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:36,432
We'd like to incorporate that across the board so that we can both back up

394
00:46:37,305 --> 00:46:42,068
data and servers so that we can recover in the event that something does go sideways on us.

395
00:46:43,529 --> 00:46:44,310
Thank you.

396
00:46:46,311 --> 00:46:51,534
And so again, there'll be more discussion about that as we get into the articulation of our capital priorities.

397
00:46:51,874 --> 00:46:55,577
I think we typically think of a lot of our capital priorities living in the buildings and grounds area.

398
00:46:56,157 --> 00:46:56,937
That's certainly true.

399
00:46:56,997 --> 00:47:05,503
And as we know, plenty of HVAC work to take to do and things like roofs and generators and all that.

400
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:12,793
There's also some heavy infrastructure on the technology side that we'll need to prioritize and address in the coming months.

401
00:47:13,613 --> 00:47:33,803
So finally, last but not least tonight, our athletic department, which Mr. Moyo will speak to, and specifically, one of the, again, to go back to the sort of the common threads, the common themes that you're hearing across each department, a lot of it has to do with student engagement and how do we,

402
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:42,542
identify the best strategies to take a population of students who have, in every respect, had their education disrupted.

403
00:47:43,122 --> 00:47:52,604
And as you've heard us say before, make sure that this experience over the course of the past few years does not define the remainder of their academic careers with the Medford Public Schools.

404
00:47:53,144 --> 00:47:58,085
And Mr. Moore is going to speak to one particular initiative that we're looking to

405
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:02,964
And it may be something that in the short term, we would look at ESSER funding for.

406
00:48:03,705 --> 00:48:09,708
In large part, as you know, the athletic department is funded through user fees and other revenue generating sources.

407
00:48:09,788 --> 00:48:28,219
But with respect to the unified champion sports program, we see that as an opportunity potentially to deepen the level of engagement across our student body in athletics and hopefully reach, give students an opportunity that they otherwise would not have to engage on a social and emotional level.

408
00:48:28,843 --> 00:48:29,705
through the use of sports.

409
00:48:29,745 --> 00:48:36,174
So, Bobby, do you want to take it from there and talk a little bit about the importance of that program and why it's something we've identified as a key priority?

410
00:48:37,316 --> 00:48:37,617
Sure.

411
00:48:37,657 --> 00:48:38,237
Thank you, Dave.

412
00:48:38,638 --> 00:48:41,322
I want to thank the committee for having me tonight.

413
00:48:42,526 --> 00:48:52,452
Special thanks to the mayor, the superintendent for their leadership school committee for allowing us to get get our sports in this year it's it's the kids have been unbelievable.

414
00:48:52,952 --> 00:48:53,973
They've gone through a lot.

415
00:48:55,053 --> 00:48:57,755
They're resilient, we started our spring season today.

416
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:06,700
So in another six weeks we're going to be happy to say we completed a season, though it was short and our kids got an opportunity to participate with their friends.

417
00:49:08,441 --> 00:49:19,350
And we gave him some kind of season but it would not have been successful without the support of the school committee, the superintendent, the mayor, our trainer did an incredible job and our coaches stepped up.

418
00:49:20,271 --> 00:49:24,335
Rachel and I, last year we wanted to do this before COVID struck.

419
00:49:25,636 --> 00:49:29,700
We would like to add unified games to our athletic arena.

420
00:49:30,788 --> 00:49:33,930
We would like to tap into our special needs population.

421
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:38,052
Uh, this would give them an opportunity to participate in the fall and the spring.

422
00:49:38,072 --> 00:49:42,955
Uh, everyone who put all the schools that participate in this, it's a wonderful event.

423
00:49:43,655 --> 00:49:46,377
And, uh, especially what, what these kids have gone through.

424
00:49:46,457 --> 00:49:49,538
And we think now's the time to pull the trigger on it.

425
00:49:50,459 --> 00:49:53,961
I've had conversations with Joan Bowen, Rachel Perry, and Paul DeLava.

426
00:49:54,993 --> 00:49:58,915
We're looking for approval of the school committee, and then we'll get approval from the MIA.

427
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:00,676
We can get this off the ground in September.

428
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:04,118
But again, special thanks to the central administration.

429
00:50:05,479 --> 00:50:08,120
We're happy we're going to get a spring season in.

430
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:12,342
And Tony Ray's been incredible, and our training has been incredible.

431
00:50:12,382 --> 00:50:13,383
So thank you to everybody.

432
00:50:14,603 --> 00:50:17,025
Thank you, Bobby.

433
00:50:17,065 --> 00:50:21,627
So again, the four areas you've heard from tonight, hopefully you've been able to see

434
00:50:22,384 --> 00:50:36,073
and recognize the connection across from a fanatic perspective as to what it is that we're trying to do in a coordinated effort to bring the district back and position our students to be well served in the wake of a very disruptive couple of years.

435
00:50:37,174 --> 00:50:43,918
These departments you probably noticed are not necessarily the biggest dollar values attached to some of these investments.

436
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:50,442
Some of the priorities could theoretically be absorbed by existing budgets and others would require

437
00:50:51,683 --> 00:50:56,026
additional investment, some of which, as I said, would be appropriate for ESSER funding.

438
00:50:56,146 --> 00:51:07,713
Others will be pieces that we'll be looking to incorporate into the operating budget based on the fact that they are, in one respect or another, a fixed cost in order to make sure that our instructional program is moving forward.

439
00:51:07,753 --> 00:51:20,242
So with that, as we have over the course of the last several evenings, I'll be happy to take your questions and thoughts and feedback as we build toward the superintendent's recommendations for a budget request from the school committee.

440
00:51:21,237 --> 00:51:22,238
Thank you, Mr Free.

441
00:51:22,478 --> 00:51:23,819
Thank you to all the department heads.

442
00:51:24,299 --> 00:51:29,643
I think we're going to go one or two questions each and go around like we had before.

443
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,524
That's working well.

444
00:51:31,625 --> 00:51:33,626
Um, Mia, if you want to remember Mr Stone.

445
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:34,407
Sure.

446
00:51:34,647 --> 00:51:35,287
Thank you, Mayor.

447
00:51:35,688 --> 00:51:35,768
Um,

448
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:40,101
Mr. Murphy, correct me, because I'm getting all the budgets confused.

449
00:51:40,121 --> 00:51:48,542
For transportation, I saw that both Mr. Maloney talked about after school, late buses for middle school, Andrews and McGlynn.

450
00:51:48,602 --> 00:51:54,643
And then also Mr. Textera mentioned to do something with the ELL students with the late bus.

451
00:51:55,103 --> 00:51:58,884
So is the transportation budget, have we not seen it yet?

452
00:51:58,944 --> 00:52:00,884
Or is it the meeting I missed?

453
00:52:01,564 --> 00:52:04,405
You have not seen the specific transportation budget.

454
00:52:04,815 --> 00:52:12,779
There are line items within some of the departments you have presented that have extracurricular transportation included in them.

455
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:24,446
We fully anticipate having additional afterschool transportation prioritized next year and funded through the ESSER budget to ensure the maximum amount of participation in some of these afterschool programs.

456
00:52:24,466 --> 00:52:31,370
So you will see that specific line when we present the operations-based budget tomorrow.

457
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:33,531
But just so there isn't confusion,

458
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,005
Athletics has a line item for transportation.

459
00:52:37,366 --> 00:52:44,892
The fine arts program has a line item for transportation because students are going to competitions and going to athletic events and things of that nature.

460
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:56,860
So it sort of lives in a few different places, but the sort of additional investment that will be specific to fiscal year 22 will be presented tomorrow evening as part of the district wide operations budget.

461
00:52:58,321 --> 00:52:58,601
Great.

462
00:52:58,862 --> 00:52:59,242
Thank you.

463
00:53:00,221 --> 00:53:12,086
And then the other question was, now I'm looking to, I'm sorry that, Paul or Mayor, you can ask someone else and I'll get back to it.

464
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:12,927
Ms.

465
00:53:12,967 --> 00:53:18,589
Mastoma, while you find that, could I just finish the answer so that I don't leave it dangling?

466
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:28,314
We are looking, as it's probably clear, at a very comprehensive approach toward extended day and afterschool activities in the 21-22 school year.

467
00:53:29,699 --> 00:53:32,820
that could look different as the programming evolves.

468
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:45,784
So I would anticipate tomorrow presenting you with a number which we've identified that we think would be appropriate based on the sort of size and scope of the afterschool extended day programming that we're thinking about.

469
00:53:46,084 --> 00:53:53,686
But that programming is admittedly still being developed and in part because we're still identifying what kids need going into next year.

470
00:53:53,746 --> 00:53:57,227
And that's gonna be a project that's going to carry into the beginning of next school year.

471
00:53:57,577 --> 00:54:09,123
So while there will be an after-school transportation budget that will be presented to you tomorrow, and I think it ultimately will likely live in the ESSER budget, I also think that's a number that could fluctuate over time.

472
00:54:09,364 --> 00:54:21,750
And that's frankly part of why it's good that we have some ESSER capacity, because the reason I think that the rationale behind ESSER lasting multiple years is it's gonna take us a while to identify exactly what do the students need and how we can best support them.

473
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:26,313
So you will see a number tomorrow night, but I think it's one that's likely to fluctuate in the future.

474
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:28,266
Okay, thank you.

475
00:54:28,286 --> 00:54:28,826
Thank you.

476
00:54:31,751 --> 00:54:34,355
Member Kretz, then Member Rousseau, then Member Van de Kloot.

477
00:54:35,477 --> 00:54:35,998
Thank you.

478
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:38,061
Yes, I wanted to thank

479
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:59,028
Everybody for their presentations and I just wanted to express that I think it's fantastic with this week long for our each day math Academy at each grade level for six to 12 in August, I just I can't believe it that's just phenomenal and I wanted to know will this Academy be at each school.

480
00:54:59,728 --> 00:55:02,069
or is it going to be centrally located?

481
00:55:02,089 --> 00:55:04,651
I was just curious how that was going to work.

482
00:55:04,811 --> 00:55:12,054
And is there a particular week that's picked out or will it be, you're still working out the details?

483
00:55:12,795 --> 00:55:29,203
I think it's, I can't speak to the specifics from a content perspective, but I think it's fair to say from a logistical perspective, we are definitely still working out the details in part because we're going to have a very multi-tiered summer program, at least we hope to, and we're in the process of developing that.

484
00:55:29,508 --> 00:55:36,009
We have just in anticipation of this, and because from a strategic perspective, we have to start recruiting people.

485
00:55:36,569 --> 00:55:45,411
We have just today posted a series of summer-based positions for people that want to work at some of the intervention camps that will be open at the elementary level.

486
00:55:46,191 --> 00:55:50,352
We'll be speaking to the committee about that in much greater detail in the near future.

487
00:55:50,412 --> 00:55:54,113
But because we have all these different pieces that have to line up,

488
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:57,080
it's gonna take us a little while to line up all the logistics.

489
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:06,348
Certainly from a calendar perspective, we don't want people having to choose between, should I go to math camp or should I go to SEL enrichment experience program?

490
00:56:06,388 --> 00:56:09,370
That's not a choice we want kids making.

491
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:15,815
Also from a building perspective, we want to do what's most convenient for families, of course.

492
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:22,801
And also I think getting students, particularly those who have not been in the building and by that point a year and a half,

493
00:56:23,087 --> 00:56:27,509
We want to get them in the building so that they can get, as I said, reacclimated to the school environment.

494
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:33,752
At the same time, we're going to have to look at what's the most, the efficiency will always play a role in this.

495
00:56:34,192 --> 00:56:39,574
And so it may be the case that students are technically inside one school, but a few weeks from now they go to a school in another.

496
00:56:39,634 --> 00:56:50,199
But at that point, there may be cases where we just say a school is a school, as long as we get them out and not in front of a computer, but actually in front of a human being and learning, that will be a step in the right direction.

497
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:52,140
So those are definitely things that have to be ironed out.

498
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:54,671
in the context of all the other programming that we're planning.

499
00:56:56,013 --> 00:56:56,493
Thank you.

500
00:56:57,134 --> 00:57:05,843
And I just had a question or maybe a recommendation for the technology in terms of consulting the part-time web support and maintenance.

501
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:12,690
I'm just thinking about our CTE students who are in the computer program.

502
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:15,353
If there's opportunities for those students to

503
00:57:15,793 --> 00:57:17,994
maybe work part-time after school.

504
00:57:19,074 --> 00:57:24,496
I'm not sure if they could get there before school, but I mean, I think that's a great, you know, option.

505
00:57:24,856 --> 00:57:34,860
You know, some of those students are in there, you know, going into their senior year and they could apply what they've learned and helping out in the support, you know, maintenance.

506
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:35,420
So Ms.

507
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:44,864
Kretz, I don't know if that's, if you've intentionally teed that question up for us as a segue into tomorrow night, but Diane Caldwell, our former associate superintendent has done

508
00:57:45,548 --> 00:57:58,058
work on a part-time basis, probably not as much part-time as she was intending, frankly, throughout the course of this year, both supporting us in the Parent Information Center and convening a working group to look at our website.

509
00:57:58,138 --> 00:58:13,751
And she has recruited the support of Lisa Miller from our vocational program, who is also in the process of recruiting students from her program that will help support us and have an active working group, both in some revisions to the website

510
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:28,555
and as looking at it on an ongoing basis to determine where we need additional professional support and from a consulting perspective, and what are some of the fixes that we can put into place over the course of this summer to have a more, as Ms.

511
00:58:28,575 --> 00:58:34,300
Layden said, a more sort of one-stop shop and efficient information source through the website.

512
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:39,924
So I think we fully agree with that, and that is something that it would be my hope that over the course of

513
00:58:40,958 --> 00:58:53,040
if not over the summer, early in the next school year, we'll be able to present to the committee, not just some improvements to the district's website, but also some student experts who have come in and helped to lend their expertise to that project.

514
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:54,561
Thank you.

515
00:58:55,061 --> 00:58:55,641
That's it for me.

516
00:58:55,661 --> 00:58:55,901
Thank you.

517
00:58:57,961 --> 00:58:58,881
Thank you, member Kretz.

518
00:58:58,941 --> 00:58:59,561
Member Rousseff?

519
00:59:00,762 --> 00:59:04,202
And then member Verindikloop.

520
00:59:05,362 --> 00:59:05,863
Thank you, Mayor.

521
00:59:06,103 --> 00:59:07,163
Thank you for the presentation.

522
00:59:09,801 --> 00:59:12,563
I guess I'll just start at the top of the presentation.

523
00:59:13,784 --> 00:59:18,146
So we have no math interventionists in the elementary schools today?

524
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:25,031
I don't believe there's any specific support at the elementary level in the form of intervention.

525
00:59:25,051 --> 00:59:25,611
Is that correct, Ms.

526
00:59:25,651 --> 00:59:25,892
Ka?

527
00:59:27,833 --> 00:59:28,393
That's right.

528
00:59:29,914 --> 00:59:31,555
Okay.

529
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:37,159
I heard reference, a lot of these long-term budgetary priorities

530
00:59:38,016 --> 00:59:46,883
are expensive, it seems like we are doing an awful lot of putting all the expensive things into the future as if they'll actually be a day when we have more money than today.

531
00:59:46,903 --> 00:59:51,627
It feels a bit Twilight Zone like situation here.

532
00:59:52,608 --> 00:59:55,870
Do we really think we're gonna have more money in the future than we have now?

533
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:57,792
I'm a little surprised.

534
00:59:58,513 --> 01:00:03,757
It feels like between the members here and the educators and superintendents,

535
01:00:04,766 --> 01:00:06,607
we have lifetimes of experience.

536
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:11,209
Does anybody remember having more money ever?

537
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:13,410
I think the answer is no.

538
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:22,534
So, you know, I think when we talk about long-term priorities, we should just call them what they are, things we know we're not gonna get.

539
01:00:24,555 --> 01:00:27,556
So a lot of these things feel like things we know we need.

540
01:00:29,937 --> 01:00:33,459
And by putting them in this category, we're saying,

541
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:38,406
We know we need them, they're really important, but it makes it look like we're gonna get to them.

542
01:00:38,947 --> 01:00:39,767
And that's just not true.

543
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:55,099
So, up until this meeting, the first two meetings or three, I forget which one we're on, first three meetings, I was understanding the long-term budgetary priorities to be included in the budget proposal we will be offering.

544
01:00:55,539 --> 01:01:01,403
So I was a little surprised to hear that clarification or how it can be framed.

545
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:08,243
Do we want to go department by department, Mayor?

546
01:01:08,603 --> 01:01:09,624
Do you think that makes more sense?

547
01:01:13,327 --> 01:01:15,828
Either way, we've kind of jumped over all around already.

548
01:01:15,908 --> 01:01:25,975
So I think sticking to the one to two questions, but yeah, if you want to start with math and English learners, I have a technology question, so.

549
01:01:26,496 --> 01:01:27,296
Yeah, I have a few of those.

550
01:01:27,336 --> 01:01:28,457
That's why I didn't want to jump down there.

551
01:01:28,997 --> 01:01:32,980
So I guess my second question, I'm not even sure if I ever asked the first question, sorry.

552
01:01:36,794 --> 01:01:46,560
The EL item in the long-term budgetary priorities, this seems very aligned to the Student Opportunity Act and community and family engagement.

553
01:01:47,001 --> 01:01:48,582
So I'm surprised to see it there.

554
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:56,207
I understand that it says TBD for budgetary impact because perhaps there just hasn't been time to get around to figuring out what that might look like in cost.

555
01:01:56,687 --> 01:02:01,490
But when I think about families that are at risk or students that are at risk,

556
01:02:02,121 --> 01:02:06,382
this seems like a surprising thing to be a, we'll get to it in the future.

557
01:02:07,983 --> 01:02:12,804
You know, a lot of, I mean, I don't know how many, I said a lot, I don't know.

558
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:21,427
There certainly are EL students whose families have not been able to receive the benefits that have come to middle income folks like myself this last year.

559
01:02:21,447 --> 01:02:27,889
And these seem to me like the kind of people that, the kind of people, I apologize for that,

560
01:02:29,423 --> 01:02:34,925
the students and families that we should be focused on making sure we can actually reach them.

561
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:42,308
So support orientation and registration processes for families of BL students.

562
01:02:43,288 --> 01:02:46,229
I'm just very surprised to see that notch.

563
01:02:46,809 --> 01:02:48,310
It's a critical item, frankly.

564
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:51,551
And I'm wondering if there's any commentary on why that is.

565
01:02:52,271 --> 01:02:53,552
I think so.

566
01:02:54,152 --> 01:02:57,373
And I think this connects to, or I hope is responsive to,

567
01:02:58,478 --> 01:03:07,806
your initial comments as well related to, like, does it end up in the long-term category because it's something we're essentially, you know, giving up on, and we don't think we'll ever actually be realized.

568
01:03:07,866 --> 01:03:13,030
And I would say that there are a few different reasons that something could end up in a long-term priority.

569
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:16,712
And I can think of sort of three concrete ones that are all distinct from one another.

570
01:03:17,073 --> 01:03:27,761
The math coaching positions are positions that, and again, I'm going to give the very short version of this, but we can bring this contact at a later presentation to speak at length about it.

571
01:03:28,778 --> 01:03:29,078
or Ms.

572
01:03:29,098 --> 01:03:31,400
Gluzzi or Dr. Cushing, because it's all related to barriers.

573
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:35,984
We're not organizationally set up to capitalize on those positions to the degree that we would like to.

574
01:03:36,344 --> 01:03:40,748
We don't think that funding those positions right now would maximize their value.

575
01:03:40,808 --> 01:03:49,936
And while preceded my time, I've had multiple administrators throughout this budgetary process identify those as something that will be very helpful when we are ready.

576
01:03:50,276 --> 01:03:52,638
But there are other shifts, be it in mindset,

577
01:03:52,977 --> 01:04:04,926
or in professional development practice that we haven't made yet, and therefore funding those additional positions, you know, $65,000 or more apiece, we don't think we would get $65,000 worth of value out of it right now.

578
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:19,236
So that's one reason that we're absolutely not giving up on it, and we're obligating ourselves to identify the efficiencies over time so that even if revenues don't increase proportionally such that we can pay for it that way, we're able to find our capacity in the budget to do that.

579
01:04:20,057 --> 01:04:21,518
There are other things that,

580
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:29,355
are actually just beyond our financial capacity when we take into account all of the other positions that we're doing.

581
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:50,448
But those are things, as I said, where if capacity is realized, if we get to, say, year two of funding priorities through ESSER, and we identify that some of the pieces that we did in the first year either weren't as effective as we hoped they'd be or aren't as necessary as they were in the first year,

582
01:04:50,889 --> 01:04:56,292
then it might be the case that we have the capacity to fund those and they'll go from long-term priorities to FY23 priorities.

583
01:04:57,072 --> 01:05:05,377
And then I think a third example is something where something is we have the concept and we know what we want to do.

584
01:05:05,877 --> 01:05:08,879
We just don't know exactly what it looks like in this moment.

585
01:05:09,279 --> 01:05:14,642
And so we don't want to essentially throw money at something until we're able to build up a plan in a better way.

586
01:05:14,982 --> 01:05:19,885
And sometimes when that's the case, we're looking at how do we identify, how do we advance the objective

587
01:05:20,485 --> 01:05:21,705
through other budget priorities.

588
01:05:22,065 --> 01:05:34,528
So tomorrow, one of the pieces of information that we'll be presenting to you is we are looking at reorganizing one of the positions in the central administration to focus on family engagement.

589
01:05:35,108 --> 01:05:47,810
And the vision for that family engagement position is to serve as a central facilitator with the offices that connect with families as they're entering into the organization.

590
01:05:48,247 --> 01:06:10,453
So that's health services, English learners, special education, and that position would be situated both physically and from an organizational perspective in a place that this person will be able to better connect with families who are in exactly the position that you're talking about, being more vulnerable and needing that stronger connection to the district right away.

591
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:14,174
So that is one way in which we're looking to advance that objective.

592
01:06:14,435 --> 01:06:16,055
That's not necessarily going to live

593
01:06:16,445 --> 01:06:24,488
within the English language learner budget, but it's certainly gonna have an impact on students who are EL.

594
01:06:24,668 --> 01:06:27,869
And that's what we're looking to do sort of across the board.

595
01:06:28,249 --> 01:06:33,611
So I don't think it's the case that because something is in the long-term priority, that it's not being prioritized.

596
01:06:33,651 --> 01:06:35,251
It might just be being prioritized elsewhere.

597
01:06:35,531 --> 01:06:38,092
And sometimes it is just being moved to a back of the list.

598
01:06:38,172 --> 01:06:45,455
And I don't wanna suggest that that's not the case ever, but I don't think that this one in particular, I think it is something that we are committed to.

599
01:06:46,337 --> 01:06:48,198
we're going to advance it in other ways in FY 22.

600
01:06:48,238 --> 01:06:50,639
But that's what we're going to try to do.

601
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:51,980
Thank you.

602
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,841
May I ask a quick clarifying question?

603
01:06:53,861 --> 01:06:56,002
Sure.

604
01:06:56,362 --> 01:07:02,426
So before the pandemic, but I thought we had math coaches at the elementary schools.

605
01:07:02,906 --> 01:07:05,927
Were we not set up for these people to actually do work?

606
01:07:06,268 --> 01:07:07,508
Or were they not effective?

607
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:12,671
I'm just, you know, and I certainly, you know, from our previous meetings, I fully

608
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:21,804
understand and support the need for some structural and organizational change for all the reasons that you have detailed very clearly.

609
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:25,007
But we did have some of these people.

610
01:07:25,027 --> 01:07:30,973
I don't know if we had as many as we describe as future goals here, but we had them.

611
01:07:30,993 --> 01:07:36,038
I did not hear that they were wandering the halls looking for something to do.

612
01:07:37,795 --> 01:07:39,696
So- I didn't mean it, just to be clear.

613
01:07:39,716 --> 01:07:41,597
I don't think anyone was wandering the halls.

614
01:07:41,677 --> 01:07:41,977
Yeah.

615
01:07:42,378 --> 01:07:50,843
So if they were on the rolls and they were doing work and being effective, how is it they can't be effective today if we hired them?

616
01:07:53,165 --> 01:07:54,486
Well, effectiveness isn't binary.

617
01:07:54,546 --> 01:07:55,647
I want to be very clear about that.

618
01:07:55,667 --> 01:07:57,808
I'm not suggesting that there was no positive impact.

619
01:07:58,288 --> 01:08:02,871
And I'm not going to speak, I'm not going to, frankly, I'm not going to speak to where there were

620
01:08:04,392 --> 01:08:07,053
you know, positive impact and where there were shortcomings, I wasn't here.

621
01:08:07,393 --> 01:08:18,275
All I can tell you is that in the meetings with, you know, 25 plus administrators, there was not a divergence of opinion as to whether this was something that we were well situated for right now.

622
01:08:18,835 --> 01:08:31,798
But like I said, you know, having one, if we can afford it, we think makes sense both right now in terms of the impact that can happen structurally and in the future for building out our capacity to utilize positions like that in the future.

623
01:08:32,918 --> 01:08:33,198
Thank you.

624
01:08:36,248 --> 01:08:36,630
Thank you.

625
01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:41,028
We have member Randa Kloot and then member McLaughlin.

626
01:08:42,796 --> 01:08:43,156
Thank you.

627
01:08:43,356 --> 01:08:47,577
And thank you to everybody for the nice, concise presentations that we had tonight.

628
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:54,219
My question in terms of the mathematics department was, but this will probably go filter through.

629
01:08:54,639 --> 01:08:58,480
I heard us talk about transportation for afterschool programs.

630
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:04,301
When we talk about the summer programs, are we envisioning transportation availability for those?

631
01:09:04,581 --> 01:09:09,442
And are we envisioning all in person or might there be a Zoom

632
01:09:13,143 --> 01:09:13,223
Um.

633
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:18,946
Uh portion to four kids who can't come into, uh, the program physically.

634
01:09:20,286 --> 01:09:21,787
You know, that's a really good question.

635
01:09:21,807 --> 01:09:24,948
Member Vanderclub both both questions are very good questions.

636
01:09:24,988 --> 01:09:26,489
I think with regard to transportation.

637
01:09:27,349 --> 01:09:29,730
I don't think I don't think we know the answer to that yet.

638
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:33,172
I think it's something that we just looking at the answer capacity.

639
01:09:33,192 --> 01:09:35,373
I'd be surprised if we don't have the

640
01:09:41,762 --> 01:09:43,562
and it's hard to imagine that there wouldn't be any.

641
01:09:44,363 --> 01:09:47,743
And so in that sense, I think we do have to look at it.

642
01:09:47,763 --> 01:09:57,885
We've had very brief conversations about that, but because there's other logistical components about exactly when and where, and in some cases who, because those haven't been ironed out yet.

643
01:09:57,905 --> 01:10:01,066
We don't have a firm answer yet on transportation, but I think it's definitely something we're open to.

644
01:10:01,446 --> 01:10:09,648
With regard to the remote piece, I think what I would say is that there is a, first of all, we want this opportunity to be open to everyone.

645
01:10:10,428 --> 01:10:11,408
Part of the objective,

646
01:10:11,733 --> 01:10:16,517
that runs through each department is to try to reacclimate students to being in learning.

647
01:10:16,657 --> 01:10:21,141
We have not been shy about the fact that we believe that students learn best when they're in person.

648
01:10:21,481 --> 01:10:26,005
At the same time, we want to make sure that the opportunities are fully accessible.

649
01:10:26,365 --> 01:10:32,450
And so if we have cases where students are unable to be in person, we're going to want to leave that lane open as well.

650
01:10:32,911 --> 01:10:37,274
But exactly what that looks like and how that sort of manifests itself, I think, is something we have to look at.

651
01:10:37,615 --> 01:10:40,217
We've had a few conversations where we've talked about, well,

652
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:53,455
we know that there are going to be students that are going to need this type of additional support, that we're going to have data just to make it clear that a constituency of students really need the additional intervention that needs to be in person.

653
01:10:53,796 --> 01:11:02,519
And then we look at it and say, well, we also know there's going to be a constituency of students who are not going to have data to suggest they absolutely need this to the extent that some of those other students do.

654
01:11:03,019 --> 01:11:09,002
And we want to because we want to keep a focus on equity and we want to keep, as I said, things accessible.

655
01:11:09,435 --> 01:11:25,002
If you could have a situation in which we had some portion of the programming that was available in person, because that's going to advance the objective of reacclimating, but then also have something remote that we're able to do, because from an efficiency perspective, we're able to pull it off virtually.

656
01:11:25,382 --> 01:11:31,065
And I think that is sort of an example of how the post-pandemic world is going to be different for all of us.

657
01:11:31,465 --> 01:11:37,267
There are going to be meetings that in the past we had to go to in person that were instead just going to sit in our office and turn on our computer.

658
01:11:37,607 --> 01:11:38,828
And there probably will be some

659
01:11:39,812 --> 01:11:48,474
instructional opportunities or counseling opportunities or other types of opportunities that we will make available virtually just to make sure we're reaching as many students as possible.

660
01:11:48,514 --> 01:11:53,115
So I would expect that that would be part of a sort of a broad regimen of support.

661
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:54,756
Okay, thank you.

662
01:11:57,136 --> 01:11:57,436
Thank you.

663
01:11:57,616 --> 01:11:58,937
Member McLaughlin, then Member Graham.

664
01:12:01,197 --> 01:12:01,617
Thank you.

665
01:12:02,858 --> 01:12:04,278
Thank you all for the presentation.

666
01:12:05,391 --> 01:12:14,139
It's nice to see some clear commitment to diversity and equity across departments.

667
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:23,968
I can see that there's some cohesiveness around that and, and I want to say that I appreciate that consideration because it's, it's critical and something that our district

668
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:28,392
really needs and I think needs to work on.

669
01:12:30,313 --> 01:12:37,056
I wanted to mention the Yale program mentioned and thank Mr. Teixeira.

670
01:12:37,076 --> 01:12:45,761
I think that you've been doing an exceptional job, frankly, and I look to you for a lot of role modeling and leadership.

671
01:12:45,821 --> 01:12:51,043
And I think the adaptive literacy program is a really important one and one that I'd like to have

672
01:12:52,424 --> 01:12:54,305
folks think about sort of in a bigger perspective.

673
01:12:54,345 --> 01:13:01,747
I think we often just tend to put ourselves in these silos and these buckets around, you know, this is this department and that's that department and that's that department.

674
01:13:01,787 --> 01:13:08,409
And I remember two years ago going in and sitting with Mr. Tisher and being able to look at some of his material and what that actually looked like and what that meant.

675
01:13:08,429 --> 01:13:13,790
And, you know, universal design for learning is something that goes across every single one of our departments.

676
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:20,512
And so when we're talking about adaptive literacy, you know, and we're thinking about all of the discussions we're having around dyslexia and

677
01:13:20,972 --> 01:13:34,070
You know, it's important to look at well what is the EL department doing around adaptive literacy, how are they actually collecting data around that, how could this apply somewhere else and and what is being done and I just, I just sort of wanted to put that out there because I think that people often.

678
01:13:35,671 --> 01:13:39,634
just put themselves in silos and aren't looking at each other necessarily as models.

679
01:13:39,674 --> 01:13:40,695
And I think we should.

680
01:13:41,475 --> 01:13:43,396
And especially also around cultural competency.

681
01:13:43,436 --> 01:13:48,620
I really appreciated Mr. Teixeira's request for professional development and cultural competency.

682
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:51,002
And frankly, I think that's something that we could use across the district.

683
01:13:51,602 --> 01:13:58,307
And I know that it's a lot to think about for every department, but I do think it's something that we need pretty much in every department.

684
01:14:00,468 --> 01:14:01,809
Technology, I wanted to ask Ms.

685
01:14:01,849 --> 01:14:25,140
Layden, I know Mr. Murphy mentioned briefly the assistive technology and adaptive technology is sort of, you mentioned microphones and what have you, but I would like to hear a little bit more about that, especially this year with having gone remote, with all of the access that students needed to have, with our population who is

686
01:14:26,009 --> 01:14:33,582
you know, who does have learning differences and others are English learners are, you know, just folks who struggle with technology in general.

687
01:14:34,585 --> 01:14:36,265
Not that English learners do, I don't mean to imply that.

688
01:14:36,285 --> 01:14:49,608
I'm just saying generally that, you know, families, parents that were struggling with technology, like what is being offered to the community around assistive technology and adaptive technology to obviously to students that require that.

689
01:14:50,128 --> 01:14:57,729
And additionally, training and development around what this looks like for families trying to figure out, you know, this whole world.

690
01:14:57,789 --> 01:15:03,390
And again, we may or may not be remote in some capacities moving forward, but has there been any sort of

691
01:15:04,794 --> 01:15:06,235
group development around these things.

692
01:15:08,235 --> 01:15:10,156
And then I can answer that a little bit.

693
01:15:10,536 --> 01:15:11,877
I actually think that Ms.

694
01:15:11,897 --> 01:15:14,598
Bowen may be able to answer some of that a little bit better than I can.

695
01:15:14,658 --> 01:15:22,240
In terms of the technology side, I can tell you sort of what was purchased and deployed, you know, that's sort of my world.

696
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:29,823
So in terms of iPads and two-in-one Chromebooks and, you know, besides the microphones and the webcams and,

697
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:36,987
support that were provided in terms of how to use and how to get those out into the hands of everyone who needed them.

698
01:15:37,387 --> 01:15:56,183
That's sort of more my world, the actual decisions of the technology that was going to be purchased to meet those needs and how they were going to be implemented and trained for both students and families is probably better answered by our special educators since we work together in terms of the purchasing and the

699
01:15:56,583 --> 01:16:03,772
deployment and what to buy, and I helped with those kinds of things, but the actual how-to is probably a better answer for you, Joan.

700
01:16:04,502 --> 01:16:12,644
Thank you, and just to clarify, I'm not looking for a whole lesson on what technology was purchased for students and accessibility.

701
01:16:12,724 --> 01:16:17,845
It's more sort of just the bigger picture looking at how these things are being presented.

702
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:19,725
I think it's actually been a blessing in a lot of ways.

703
01:16:19,785 --> 01:16:28,607
We had a lot of students who did need iPads and I think can benefit from that obviously, but I would like to hear Ms.

704
01:16:28,627 --> 01:16:33,608
Bowen just a little bit about how big picture, not micro, just macro sort of you're looking at this, please.

705
01:16:34,492 --> 01:16:38,254
Sure, so we look at what the needs are within the district.

706
01:16:38,294 --> 01:16:44,378
We do have the ability to do assistive technology evaluation and assessments throughout the district.

707
01:16:45,319 --> 01:16:54,565
When a need becomes apparent to us, we will evaluate in that area to determine what the individual student may need or what the classroom may need.

708
01:16:54,905 --> 01:16:59,328
And then we look at, we also meet with Molly, Jan Hollenbeck is

709
01:17:00,468 --> 01:17:18,655
One of our people who do the assistive technology evaluations in her department, and then we consult with Molly and her department on what would be the best devices to purchase, what it's going to look like, what we require to use those and to implement them throughout the district.

710
01:17:19,785 --> 01:17:20,526
Yeah, thank you.

711
01:17:20,626 --> 01:17:28,031
And I just, for example, I just, I guess I wanted to share with, you know, folks in our instance, you know, we have, Grace has a reading disability.

712
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:30,933
And so she has access to Bookshare, right?

713
01:17:31,373 --> 01:17:35,356
And a lot of people, frankly, in the community and in the district don't know what Bookshare is.

714
01:17:35,976 --> 01:17:39,059
And anyone with a reading disability qualifies for Bookshare.

715
01:17:39,099 --> 01:17:43,382
You can have access to a library with thousands of electronic books.

716
01:17:43,982 --> 01:17:48,105
for free once you have a diagnosis of a reading disability.

717
01:17:48,165 --> 01:17:52,848
And I think that that's something that's just sort of a general understanding that people across the district should know.

718
01:17:52,908 --> 01:18:06,797
And I think that unfortunately what happens, it certainly did in our case, is we have to bring that nugget of information that we've learned from parents or from a Federation for Children with Special Needs group or something else to the district in our IEP to sort of share that.

719
01:18:06,857 --> 01:18:09,459
And I want to make sure that these things are more universal.

720
01:18:09,539 --> 01:18:09,599
And

721
01:18:10,105 --> 01:18:25,087
know experience across the board for folks and and and I guess I don't necessarily think there's an answer to that tonight I guess I'm just trying to put that out there for everybody that we're thinking about what this looks like from all perspectives and that's part of what I'm seeing tonight and it's refreshing because

722
01:18:26,225 --> 01:18:27,866
Frankly, I hadn't seen that a lot before.

723
01:18:28,006 --> 01:18:38,210
And so I would ask people to continue on that path and to continue thinking about how do each of these departments apply to these marginalized populations.

724
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:42,272
And same with the math programs.

725
01:18:42,332 --> 01:18:43,913
And I appreciated David saying that

726
01:18:44,493 --> 01:19:04,542
Mr. Murphy saying that it's a multi-tiered summer program and you know I think that that's great it's a multi-tiered summer program and that it's going to be accessible for all students and I think we have to think about what those supports look like obviously and I'm sure as the experts you guys are thinking about that but I just have to put that out to the community as well that you know every student should have access to all of these programs and

727
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:19,380
And I'm sure that, you know, with our, with our equity as being our driving force that they will and so the unified sports to I think, again, this is something that's been asked for for a while, Malden does a really good job with their challenger team and.

728
01:19:20,498 --> 01:19:21,459
Medford hasn't done this.

729
01:19:21,619 --> 01:19:28,363
And frankly, we have the Special Olympics hosted at Hormel, but it's hosted by Malden, which is ironic.

730
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:31,205
And so it's good to see that this year.

731
01:19:31,385 --> 01:19:35,308
And I would really, again, and I'm gonna circle it up with the family engagement position.

732
01:19:35,348 --> 01:19:48,297
I think that having the family engagement position person would have you looking at these things across departments in a macro way about how are you actually involving, especially the marginalized communities that aren't coming to the table is what we really need to

733
01:19:49,237 --> 01:20:01,067
To be thinking of and I guess Lastly, I want to put out there and I know tomorrow we have a meeting that will discuss some of this but I guess you know all of this comes down to money right we all know that all of these things that are our wants and our different needs in this.

734
01:20:02,422 --> 01:20:09,245
Zoom box that we're all in tonight, representing our own interests and the interests of constituents, all comes down to money.

735
01:20:10,365 --> 01:20:16,307
And the one thing that we haven't addressed, and I'm not sure why, is the need for a grant writer in our district.

736
01:20:16,387 --> 01:20:21,949
We need somebody who can help us bring some money into this district in the formation of grant writing.

737
01:20:22,089 --> 01:20:25,211
And you guys are dividing that job among so many people.

738
01:20:25,631 --> 01:20:31,173
And I know that grants have come in, we've been fortunate in a number of ways, but I feel like if we were really targeting these

739
01:20:32,355 --> 01:20:35,977
objectives that we say that we have that our priorities that we say are so important.

740
01:20:36,497 --> 01:20:41,899
And we're thinking about how we actually targeting these for money and grants, then we would be in a much better position.

741
01:20:41,959 --> 01:20:44,560
And that's my soapbox.

742
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:44,981
Thank you.

743
01:20:45,801 --> 01:21:01,868
I wouldn't, I mean, I wouldn't describe it as a soapbox, at least in a type of pejorative sense, because I think that, first, I just want to thank you, Member McLaughlin, for recognizing the extent to which we are attempting to present this budget in a

744
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:03,710
cohesive fashion.

745
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:21,915
And the reality is that when the forum that has been adopted by the school committee is bringing forward close to two dozen administrators, there is a risk that you get two dozen visions, two dozen missions, two dozen priorities, and some of them may or may not have anything to do with each other.

746
01:21:22,535 --> 01:21:32,357
And what we've tried to do in the framing of our questions and development of the priorities is to identify, one, the common theme of how do we build back

747
01:21:33,258 --> 01:21:44,427
And two, how do we do so in a way that addresses some of the systemic inequities that I think are reflective in your comments.

748
01:21:44,487 --> 01:21:49,812
And so my hope is that, I think we have been mostly successful in presenting that.

749
01:21:50,192 --> 01:21:57,618
And obviously the real work comes into how do we put that into practice and how do we execute in a way that's reflective of those values and those priorities.

750
01:21:57,658 --> 01:22:01,261
And that will be the work throughout the course of the fiscal year.

751
01:22:01,608 --> 01:22:19,000
And I'll just say very briefly, I know this probably, it probably sounds like I'm just making a list of positions that you'd like to see, but I can promise you, and I know that we've had some, some of you have had conversations with because you've asked specific questions about this in the past, but we are intending to repurpose a different central office position as a grant coordinator position.

752
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,962
And I've actually taken steps to do that effective immediately.

753
01:22:21,982 --> 01:22:28,907
That is a grant coordinator and not necessarily a development officer.

754
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:36,792
And we are looking at some other sort of project-based work to try to identify ways to bring in additional funding.

755
01:22:36,812 --> 01:22:39,453
But that's a little bit further down the road.

756
01:22:39,493 --> 01:22:47,135
But tomorrow when we talk about the central office structure and specifically the Office of Finance and Operations, we will address the grant coordinator position as well.

757
01:22:50,276 --> 01:22:50,636
Thank you.

758
01:22:50,656 --> 01:22:52,036
Member Graham.

759
01:22:55,057 --> 01:22:55,597
Thank you.

760
01:22:55,617 --> 01:22:57,778
I had some questions about

761
01:23:01,082 --> 01:23:02,083
Member Graham, you're muted.

762
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:05,545
Okay.

763
01:23:05,625 --> 01:23:08,646
I had some questions about the math department to start.

764
01:23:10,727 --> 01:23:10,948
Ms.

765
01:23:10,968 --> 01:23:27,477
Khan, based on what you were saying, I think what I heard was that we weren't going to continue down the path of picking a math curriculum, but instead we are gonna go with the Envisions Math 2020 curriculum.

766
01:23:27,797 --> 01:23:29,258
Is that what you were saying?

767
01:23:29,873 --> 01:23:32,034
That is right, just for this one year.

768
01:23:32,934 --> 01:23:41,138
While our teachers are piloting, our other teachers need a program that they can continue with.

769
01:23:41,178 --> 01:23:45,420
So it'll be for the teachers who are not piloting in the district.

770
01:23:46,561 --> 01:23:47,061
Oh, okay.

771
01:23:47,101 --> 01:23:52,664
So we are still planning to do a selection for a new program in one year?

772
01:23:53,144 --> 01:23:53,344
Yes.

773
01:23:53,991 --> 01:23:55,252
Okay.

774
01:23:56,072 --> 01:24:05,639
So while we may not be set up to support math coaches, I do have a question about why we're only set up to support interventionists at the middle school and not at the elementary school.

775
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:08,441
That's a very fair question.

776
01:24:08,461 --> 01:24:17,847
And I will say, as I mentioned in response to a member of those questions, there are sort of three reasons that something could fall into a long-term priority.

777
01:24:18,267 --> 01:24:21,989
And I would say that the elementary intervention specialists, I think it is something

778
01:24:23,728 --> 01:24:25,289
that would be helpful.

779
01:24:25,829 --> 01:24:36,113
I think from a budgetary perspective, it's simply a matter of prioritizing the literacy interventions first in the hope of being able to provide the additional math support.

780
01:24:36,874 --> 01:24:51,420
So that's not to say that that option wouldn't be available, but in terms of mapping out where we are, in terms of the use of our one-time funding that's available now, the current recommendation would be to focus on

781
01:24:51,915 --> 01:24:58,421
on literacy while we work to identify the capacity to be able to fund the math positions.

782
01:24:59,522 --> 01:25:01,543
So it's a funding priority, not necessarily.

783
01:25:02,064 --> 01:25:04,926
It's content-informed, but it's primarily funding.

784
01:25:04,946 --> 01:25:05,266
But Ms.

785
01:25:05,286 --> 01:25:08,249
Colucci, did you want to add to that comment?

786
01:25:08,909 --> 01:25:10,291
Well, I see the superintendent's hand.

787
01:25:10,331 --> 01:25:12,072
I'll defer to her, and then I'll follow up if.

788
01:25:13,213 --> 01:25:20,079
Yeah, I also wanted to say, in response to Member Graham's comment,

789
01:25:20,698 --> 01:25:25,841
that it is a slightly different structure between the middle school structure and the elementary structure.

790
01:25:26,742 --> 01:25:45,434
And I actually feel with us piloting the different curriculum across the different buildings, that it is something that we should definitely be pushing pause on at this point in time with the math coaching while we're in the process of figuring out which

791
01:25:46,334 --> 01:26:07,321
what's the new curriculum going to be for all of our elementary schools and so it's not that we're taking our eyes off of mathematics instruction because we do want to pick the best program that will continue to you know move our kids forward and align with what is going to take place with the illustrative math that's at the

792
01:26:09,643 --> 01:26:10,523
the middle school level.

793
01:26:11,104 --> 01:26:14,086
So we want to just keep all of that in mind.

794
01:26:14,727 --> 01:26:28,258
So with the focus on the literacy, hoping to have the reading and literacy support at the elementary schools, where that is another area that is also equally important.

795
01:26:28,338 --> 01:26:38,026
We're trying to, I would almost say, balance it and again, balance capacity of the teachers and what's happening within the schools from a structural level.

796
01:26:40,527 --> 01:26:45,889
So in what year will we expect to see interventionists and math coaches at the elementary school?

797
01:26:48,730 --> 01:26:56,393
Especially for people that haven't been immersed in this discussion before, there are two different types of positions that we're talking about.

798
01:26:56,593 --> 01:26:58,974
And we're not doing either one of them next year in elementary?

799
01:26:59,554 --> 01:27:01,535
For math at the elementary, that is correct.

800
01:27:01,915 --> 01:27:03,216
That's what's recommended right now.

801
01:27:04,676 --> 01:27:05,717
But for two different reasons.

802
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:15,026
Coaches are based on the structure and the setup, and I was believing that we're not necessarily ready to do it right now, even if the funding were readily available.

803
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:27,236
I guess if there was enough funding, we could probably expedite some of the other changes, but we think that even in the most favorable, looking at it in the most favorable light, that's something that should be sequenced later.

804
01:27:27,757 --> 01:27:35,683
The interventionist supports, which are the direct support to students, that's more of a budgetary consideration in terms of looking at that priority

805
01:27:36,141 --> 01:27:44,169
but also taking into account the content implications, which I thought you wanted to add on that piece of it with regard to literacy versus math.

806
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:49,614
I just personally wanted to say that the coaching to me is the

807
01:27:50,683 --> 01:27:52,684
more of the key point in working with the staff.

808
01:27:53,024 --> 01:28:06,848
The interventionist, to me, is a structural piece that is a very delicate balance when it comes to mathematics, because we don't want to put interventionists to pull students out of a math lesson that they're going to miss core content.

809
01:28:07,468 --> 01:28:14,250
And right now, if you have the coaching to work with the teachers on part of the math curriculum,

810
01:28:15,294 --> 01:28:29,958
like we were talking about, the interventionist piece is a little bit more of the scheduling and the structural piece of how to have interventionists be effective and actually compliment the math lesson.

811
01:28:29,978 --> 01:28:40,241
I don't know if you're understanding what I'm saying, but when a teacher has a math lesson for 60 to 75 minutes, it's really not, at the elementary level, it's really not all that

812
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:46,582
effective to remove students from the class for intervention.

813
01:28:46,622 --> 01:28:51,585
They need to be there for the lesson, the activities that follow, the review.

814
01:28:52,225 --> 01:29:00,490
We have to build up the structure, especially coming out of COVID, where the successful piece of using an interventionist would be pushing into the classroom.

815
01:29:00,890 --> 01:29:09,995
And for next year, where there's going to be three, maybe four, but at least three different math programs going on, it's not the best use of staff.

816
01:29:11,974 --> 01:29:14,395
Does, do I, I don't know if I'm.

817
01:29:15,136 --> 01:29:16,156
Yeah, I understand.

818
01:29:16,297 --> 01:29:28,804
I think you've clarified something that I misspoke about in that it's a budgetary priority as a result of not being prepared to absorb and effectively utilize the coaches.

819
01:29:28,964 --> 01:29:39,110
So if we can put the coaches in place, then the structure could be modified such that the interventionist could be a better investment, which is why in this, to go to the point that I made earlier,

820
01:29:39,571 --> 01:29:46,713
If we do have the capacity, we fully expect to try to do at least one elementary level math coach to begin to build out that capacity.

821
01:29:46,993 --> 01:29:51,474
But that would sort of be step one, which would lead to more coaches, which would eventually get to interventionists.

822
01:29:51,774 --> 01:29:54,835
And in terms, I think your question is, okay, well then when?

823
01:29:55,475 --> 01:29:56,536
And I think that's a fair question.

824
01:29:56,576 --> 01:30:04,238
I think we fully understand the urgency of it, which is why if there is capacity after the ESSER budget is built, we could be in a better position to do that.

825
01:30:05,478 --> 01:30:08,919
And if not, it has to be soon, which puts the onus on us, frankly, to identify

826
01:30:09,538 --> 01:30:10,338
that capacity.

827
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:17,342
The other question I had about math is the number on the slide said 255.

828
01:30:17,942 --> 01:30:22,224
And I can't find a way that these numbers on my paper add to 255.

829
01:30:22,744 --> 01:30:29,048
So what thing that's on my paper doesn't actually fit into the slide that you showed us?

830
01:30:29,308 --> 01:30:36,131
I believe it's the, I think it's because the green check marks indicate that

831
01:30:37,082 --> 01:30:44,965
We're not, we weren't in that column, adding up the math intervention specialists at the middle school, because they're not included in that.

832
01:30:45,045 --> 01:30:48,666
So I think the 255, sorry, I just need to find it really quick.

833
01:30:51,347 --> 01:31:01,151
Yes, because in the documents, in the full documents, it says 320, because that would include the funding for those other positions, but the 255

834
01:31:02,599 --> 01:31:11,987
I believe is 85,000 for the, well, that might've been down to 60, 60,000 for the envisions.

835
01:31:12,747 --> 01:31:18,612
And so then it would count the, I'm gonna have to go back and look at that, Ms.

836
01:31:18,652 --> 01:31:19,393
Brown, to be honest with you.

837
01:31:19,413 --> 01:31:24,617
I'm not sure how that adds up either to 255, unless it does include those positions, but then I don't know why the 320 would.

838
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:36,793
Is the intent that the 255 equals the critical 22 budget priorities, the additional budget priorities worthy of consideration and the COVID mitigation priority?

839
01:31:39,354 --> 01:31:40,074
Is that the intent?

840
01:31:41,114 --> 01:31:44,135
I'm just gonna have to go back and review it.

841
01:31:44,475 --> 01:31:49,017
Are you talking about the deck that was presented in this meeting on the full presentation?

842
01:31:49,577 --> 01:31:51,337
The one that was presented in this meeting earlier.

843
01:31:51,357 --> 01:31:53,978
Give me one second.

844
01:31:56,050 --> 01:32:06,337
They're just, I just want to be crystal clear what we will ultimately vote on at the end of tonight, because it was, in every vote I've ever taken on this topic.

845
01:32:06,757 --> 01:32:08,058
Yeah, it's exactly what you just said.

846
01:32:09,379 --> 01:32:10,219
Those three categories.

847
01:32:10,299 --> 01:32:19,765
In every vote I've ever taken on this topic, I have been under the understanding that we are including all four categories, which also includes the long-term priorities, and now I'm being told we're not.

848
01:32:19,845 --> 01:32:21,947
So I just want to be super clear about

849
01:32:23,346 --> 01:32:26,087
what is in when we say we're voting for something.

850
01:32:26,107 --> 01:32:31,228
So that if there's something that's not in that we feel like should be in, we can be clear about that.

851
01:32:31,328 --> 01:32:35,829
So that that doesn't have to wait until June 1st for us to deal with.

852
01:32:36,469 --> 01:32:37,029
Sure.

853
01:32:37,189 --> 01:32:48,712
I mean, in some of those priorities, they could be, as I said before, with the EL example, and that they're incorporated elsewhere.

854
01:32:49,479 --> 01:32:53,662
That vote, I would say, indicates the committee's support for all of those priorities.

855
01:32:54,003 --> 01:33:02,569
But in several of those, there wasn't an actual price tag attached to the priority, because it's not something we're able to identify as of yet.

856
01:33:02,589 --> 01:33:06,753
So that wouldn't be something that we would necessarily be able to incorporate into an operating budget now.

857
01:33:07,133 --> 01:33:09,895
But based on the committee's vote, we understand the committee is supportive of it.

858
01:33:10,175 --> 01:33:16,340
And so we're doing the work necessary to identify, one, how much it costs, and then identify a budget that it can ultimately be placed in.

859
01:33:16,801 --> 01:33:18,522
Some cases, that could be an operating budget.

860
01:33:18,949 --> 01:33:20,750
if there's capacity recognized.

861
01:33:21,151 --> 01:33:25,494
And so it could be there based on the committee expression of support.

862
01:33:25,854 --> 01:33:30,617
And in other cases, it might be that, well, if it's gonna live somewhere, it's going to have to live in the ESSER budget.

863
01:33:30,997 --> 01:33:33,920
And so similar to the operating budget, we would present that to you.

864
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:43,586
And we would say, based on your support, we know this is something the committee's in favor of, but before we pull the trigger on it, we want you to know this is how much it costs and this is the budget we think it needs to live.

865
01:33:44,897 --> 01:33:45,257
That vote.

866
01:33:45,317 --> 01:33:47,898
It's I don't want you to think that that's somehow just a ceremonial vote.

867
01:33:47,939 --> 01:33:51,320
We understand that we interpret that to be the committee is saying this is a priority.

868
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:52,661
We want to see funded.

869
01:33:52,701 --> 01:33:53,681
We want to we want to see it.

870
01:33:54,762 --> 01:34:07,248
We want to move forward as we've talked about in the beginning that we also are planning for various contingencies that we will be able to operate the district under based on an appropriation that will

871
01:34:08,150 --> 01:34:12,613
you know, it may likely be less than what the committee ultimately requests.

872
01:34:12,653 --> 01:34:15,114
And that's not uncommon and we'll be prepared to do that.

873
01:34:15,455 --> 01:34:24,741
We still think it's important to present this information to the committee and to the community and for the committee to voice either its support or its expectation that the administration move in a different direction.

874
01:34:26,182 --> 01:34:31,305
And, you know, I think that that's sort of the sort of rationale behind how we're probably spelling that out.

875
01:34:31,705 --> 01:34:37,589
But in the case of this one, I think in the map in particular, you know, we are talking about a substantial

876
01:34:38,245 --> 01:34:38,765
investment.

877
01:34:38,886 --> 01:35:01,963
And so if the committee were to vote for the four coaches and four intervention specialists, we are looking at a number that like, we don't even think we would, we would not recommend it even be supported in the Esther budget, because of the, the size of the investment, frankly, but we don't want to skip over it and not discuss it in this forum, because we do think, ultimately, it's something that would have a positive impact on the district.

878
01:35:02,023 --> 01:35:07,768
It's just not something that, you know, eight new positions in this particular context is not something that

879
01:35:09,674 --> 01:35:11,355
seems particularly viable at this point.

880
01:35:12,156 --> 01:35:22,844
Yeah, and I can understand eight being a number that is hard to manage, but zero is also a number that is equally unpalatable for me.

881
01:35:23,024 --> 01:35:27,027
I mean, we're coming out of, you know, we have a deficient curriculum.

882
01:35:28,048 --> 01:35:30,310
Our test scores show that we have a lot of work to do in math.

883
01:35:31,178 --> 01:35:32,619
We got rid of our coaches.

884
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:35,921
We had an 18-month pandemic.

885
01:35:36,782 --> 01:35:38,083
We have students who are behind.

886
01:35:38,663 --> 01:35:42,426
We're going to pilot new curricula, but we don't need any more staff to make that successful.

887
01:35:43,407 --> 01:35:47,249
I'm really struggling with how that is all feasibly possible.

888
01:35:47,269 --> 01:35:57,657
And frankly, when you install new curricula, having the folks who are going to need to coach and lead be at the front of that is always preferable.

889
01:35:59,016 --> 01:36:00,516
from an expertise perspective.

890
01:36:00,716 --> 01:36:06,678
So I'm not entirely comfortable with going with zero.

891
01:36:07,638 --> 01:36:27,622
That's fair and just to be clear, I think we've been very grateful for the committee's support with the recommendation so far, but if the committee votes, I think given all of the other priorities, I think it's inevitable that if the committee votes to add more than one coach, we're gonna end up back in front of you explaining to you

892
01:36:28,128 --> 01:36:29,589
what are the things we're gonna have to pull out?

893
01:36:29,669 --> 01:36:31,291
What are we gonna have to cut?

894
01:36:31,571 --> 01:36:36,655
I think that's inevitable, but I think if the committee votes for one, understanding that we'll probably have to look at the ESSER budget.

895
01:36:37,255 --> 01:36:42,319
I'm not in a position to say, I think that would be reckless or anything along those lines.

896
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:44,821
I think I just defer to the committee on that.

897
01:36:46,523 --> 01:36:52,627
Okay, I have several other questions, Mayor, so I don't know if you want me to keep asking them or if you want me not to.

898
01:36:53,488 --> 01:36:55,089
Yeah, and take one or two each.

899
01:36:56,799 --> 01:36:59,562
let's go to Paul and then maybe back to you, just put your hand up again.

900
01:37:00,002 --> 01:37:03,907
If I may ask one or two questions myself, just for clarity, Ms.

901
01:37:04,187 --> 01:37:17,621
Kahn, can you explain which grade levels are piloting and which ones are staying with the envisions 2020, just so I can get a better idea and understanding?

902
01:37:18,978 --> 01:37:20,499
Yes, that's a great question.

903
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:28,626
So the committee members are from kindergarten all the way to fifth grade.

904
01:37:29,327 --> 01:37:35,712
So we have three or four committee members at each grade level.

905
01:37:35,792 --> 01:37:43,940
We have newcomers, we have special education teachers in those committee members as well.

906
01:37:45,321 --> 01:37:55,248
and the programs, two programs that will be selected will be at each school but at different grade levels.

907
01:37:55,328 --> 01:38:04,655
So I just have to look at the whole list to see which school, you know, and which particular teachers are committee members who will be piloting

908
01:38:05,195 --> 01:38:10,039
but it will not be that third grade all across is piloting.

909
01:38:10,139 --> 01:38:27,651
It might be that two schools, for example, Columbus and Brooks, and this is just, I'm pulling names randomly, two, you know, third grade teachers, one from each school will be piloting and that the other two might be at different schools.

910
01:38:28,492 --> 01:38:29,592
So, you know.

911
01:38:29,613 --> 01:38:30,633
Okay, that's helpful.

912
01:38:30,653 --> 01:38:32,955
So how many classrooms total in the elementary schools?

913
01:38:33,384 --> 01:38:39,150
I believe we are shooting for about 24, so four at each grade level.

914
01:38:40,291 --> 01:38:45,637
And that includes special education and the newcomers.

915
01:38:46,638 --> 01:38:47,098
Very helpful.

916
01:38:47,118 --> 01:38:48,019
Thank you.

917
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:53,805
And then just my second question for Mr. Arena and Ms.

918
01:38:53,825 --> 01:38:54,065
Layden.

919
01:38:56,260 --> 01:39:05,963
with the ARPA funding, one of the biggest pieces of guidance we've got so far is water and sewer and broadband infrastructure.

920
01:39:06,043 --> 01:39:15,566
Can you tell us a little bit, when I think of broadband, I think of the problems at the high school as it relates to internet access and cell access.

921
01:39:15,646 --> 01:39:22,008
So can you, do you have any idea what it would take to fix that and fix it, you know, for good?

922
01:39:22,028 --> 01:39:25,969
If you're talking about broadband,

923
01:39:26,652 --> 01:39:31,876
I can tell you that we are well under subscribed as opposed to when we made the upgrade about a year ago.

924
01:39:32,916 --> 01:39:41,022
So the issue is not going to be about, you know, basically running out of internet access because of congestion on the line.

925
01:39:41,982 --> 01:39:46,766
Most of the metrics that I'm seeing show that we're using probably less than 50%.

926
01:39:47,026 --> 01:39:56,232
There's an occasional spike here and there, but generally speaking, if there are issues, it's more at the device level as opposed to running out of bandwidth.

927
01:40:02,296 --> 01:40:23,473
So the parents that reach out to us about keeping their kids remote because they're afraid, Zooms won't work, from teachers that are teaching remote, it's all related to technology and there's nothing we can do with the broadband to fix any of these problems.

928
01:40:25,634 --> 01:40:28,977
Well, once again, it's not because we are running out of bandwidth.

929
01:40:30,095 --> 01:40:37,357
There could be technology issues that include both the instructional side and the network side, but it's not because we're running out of bandwidth.

930
01:40:37,417 --> 01:40:51,001
And I'll give you as an example, if you have a number of people trying to stream audio or visual, that will chew up a lot of the bandwidth within the building, but not necessarily make it out to the internet.

931
01:40:51,821 --> 01:40:56,483
You could also have issues with older devices that aren't capable of projecting

932
01:40:58,662 --> 01:41:02,303
you know, if they're trying to do streaming back to the classroom.

933
01:41:02,864 --> 01:41:07,466
And these things that, you know, we're addressing that as we go through, because it's an individual basis.

934
01:41:07,506 --> 01:41:15,189
You could have someone that says that the internet doesn't work and you find out it's the device, or that the device doesn't work and you find out it's that they're attaching to the wrong wireless.

935
01:41:15,229 --> 01:41:24,373
So there's a number of different issues and both the technology department, including their library staff, as well as myself are combing through those.

936
01:41:24,493 --> 01:41:25,213
And like I said,

937
01:41:25,922 --> 01:41:28,623
We haven't found too many issues that aren't attenable.

938
01:41:29,024 --> 01:41:35,187
We can resolve most of them once we get our hands on the device or get more information about why it's not working.

939
01:41:36,887 --> 01:41:52,175
I think Mayor, we've made some improvements from an infrastructure perspective, both with regard to device and Wi-Fi capacity, to Mr. Irwin's point, where what we need, I think, to improve on our systems

940
01:41:52,803 --> 01:42:02,188
that put users in a place where they're more easily accessing without having to take additional steps in the way they are in other venues that they might visit.

941
01:42:02,228 --> 01:42:13,195
I think that the norm has become when you walk into any building, in society almost, you're able to relatively easily get onto a Wi-Fi signal.

942
01:42:13,295 --> 01:42:21,159
And I don't know that we've fully fleshed out all of our systems in a way, in part because we're doing our best to keep our networks secure.

943
01:42:22,935 --> 01:42:25,077
to do so on a relatively limited budget.

944
01:42:25,557 --> 01:42:32,301
And in doing that, I think we've made it more challenging than it is acceptable for some of our users.

945
01:42:32,381 --> 01:42:35,824
But Mr. Arena's point, the structure is in place.

946
01:42:36,784 --> 01:42:43,509
I think we just need to develop the systems and that's something that is a chief priority for us going into the new school year.

947
01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:45,430
Thank you.

948
01:42:49,497 --> 01:42:50,377
people put their hands down.

949
01:42:50,417 --> 01:42:53,659
So just let me know if you want to speak or if you have any more questions.

950
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:57,660
Member Rousseau and then Member Graham.

951
01:42:59,441 --> 01:43:00,041
Thank you, Mayor.

952
01:43:00,061 --> 01:43:08,065
So I had, frankly, an awful lot of questions about the technology stuff.

953
01:43:08,085 --> 01:43:15,708
I guess I just spend too much time reading about technology stuff because of my particular profession.

954
01:43:16,368 --> 01:43:18,109
But, you know,

955
01:43:19,474 --> 01:43:33,519
The latest survey from this year is in the last 12 months, 54% of medium to large organizations, and we certainly qualify as a medium sized organization, have experienced a ransomware attack or intrusion of that nature.

956
01:43:34,479 --> 01:43:40,781
And so I guess my question is, I see a lot of great things that are listed as capital.

957
01:43:42,742 --> 01:43:47,143
Do we have promises for every item that says capital that we are getting that money?

958
01:43:49,022 --> 01:43:49,762
have promises.

959
01:43:51,103 --> 01:43:53,204
Do we do we know that that money is really coming to us?

960
01:43:53,284 --> 01:44:07,390
Or is that like a we've had a conversation with somebody in finance in the city, and they said they're going to give it to us, but it may not show up because some of these things here are not things that are can wait or be at risk of not happening.

961
01:44:08,271 --> 01:44:11,913
Yeah, I mean, we have a we have a capital budget that's been appropriated.

962
01:44:11,933 --> 01:44:17,255
That, you know, we're working with the city in this collaborative manner.

963
01:44:18,190 --> 01:44:21,413
as we can to make sure that those priorities are fully articulated.

964
01:44:21,473 --> 01:44:23,634
And so we have some capacity.

965
01:44:23,875 --> 01:44:40,247
I don't think given some of the competing demands, particularly things like generators and hot water heaters and roofing, I mean, I don't think 100% of the capacity that's been identified so far can go toward the IT priorities that are listed here.

966
01:44:40,607 --> 01:44:47,212
And there are some, if you see there are places that we can, there are a few things that from a strategic perspective we can defer on

967
01:44:47,662 --> 01:44:52,783
but you're also correct that some of these things are critical infrastructure that we need to address in the near future.

968
01:44:54,163 --> 01:44:55,744
So there's a limit.

969
01:44:56,124 --> 01:44:57,724
Let me rephrase my question.

970
01:44:58,044 --> 01:45:04,245
Your question is 100% of those priorities already paid for?

971
01:45:04,565 --> 01:45:05,566
The answer is definitely no.

972
01:45:06,126 --> 01:45:08,246
But that's not to say that none of it is either.

973
01:45:08,726 --> 01:45:13,667
There's just that there are more demands than there is financial capacity at the moment.

974
01:45:14,587 --> 01:45:17,488
And that's why we have to be strategic about it.

975
01:45:18,747 --> 01:45:23,589
If I can answer as best I can, I think I understand your question.

976
01:45:25,470 --> 01:45:40,918
Just with regards to this, I know Mr. Murphy and our superintendent are taking any type of guidance they can on their calls regarding ESSER money, regarding ARPA money, we're doing the same on the city side.

977
01:45:41,038 --> 01:45:45,860
I had a meeting with DLS this morning and other mayors and financial

978
01:45:46,958 --> 01:45:55,506
people from different cities and towns, and almost half, at least half of the questions we ask, they still cannot answer.

979
01:45:55,947 --> 01:46:05,096
So right now, water, sewer, broadband infrastructure, we can use our money for plugging revenue gaps, but it's just seeming extremely restrictive.

980
01:46:05,236 --> 01:46:09,981
So we are waiting for more guidance on what we can even try to propose

981
01:46:10,414 --> 01:46:16,658
to pay for so that we can free up some general fund money to supplement on the school side.

982
01:46:17,398 --> 01:46:25,143
As of right now, it's just, it's so restrictive, it's kind of crazy the amount we'd be able to spend based on the guidance we have.

983
01:46:25,583 --> 01:46:33,868
And we know there's ways we're hiring a consultant that's hopefully starting signing a contract on Monday that's gonna help guide us through this.

984
01:46:33,948 --> 01:46:39,952
And it's really late in the process, but guidance, the 152 page guidance wasn't released until

985
01:46:40,791 --> 01:46:43,454
last Wednesday or Thursday, so we're still navigating.

986
01:46:43,474 --> 01:46:46,877
I am trying to get more money for the schools.

987
01:46:46,917 --> 01:46:50,341
I just, we need to be strategic and wait for the answers.

988
01:46:51,602 --> 01:46:52,183
Thank you, Mayor.

989
01:46:52,203 --> 01:46:52,903
I appreciate that.

990
01:46:54,565 --> 01:46:58,449
So let me just kind of go through some of my questions.

991
01:46:59,250 --> 01:47:04,335
I was surprised to not see in here a big spend on

992
01:47:04,838 --> 01:47:11,462
a brand new website and infrastructure for a municipal information system or whatever the equivalent is for school systems.

993
01:47:13,443 --> 01:47:30,091
You know, I don't mean this to be, it's not an attack on employees that are doing the hard work right now of maintaining our website by opening up HTML files and saving them, but that is not, that's not an information system and that is not a website.

994
01:47:31,662 --> 01:47:36,386
That's what I created in 1995 in my senior computer science class.

995
01:47:37,007 --> 01:47:39,869
That's how old the technology we're using is.

996
01:47:40,690 --> 01:47:43,452
And we can't do this work.

997
01:47:43,693 --> 01:47:48,577
We should be outsourcing this work, or at least outsourcing the getting it up and running.

998
01:47:50,098 --> 01:47:54,782
There are literally countless firms that do this for municipalities and school systems.

999
01:47:56,804 --> 01:47:57,785
And, you know,

1000
01:47:59,430 --> 01:48:07,073
I get tired and I also feel bad emailing assistant superintendents to say, this page has a link that doesn't work, this page I can't find it.

1001
01:48:07,493 --> 01:48:10,314
I go into the search and I type the most basic things.

1002
01:48:11,795 --> 01:48:16,717
As a school committee member who's on the website all the time, basic things I do a search for, I can't find it at all.

1003
01:48:18,258 --> 01:48:18,978
And I know they're there.

1004
01:48:18,998 --> 01:48:27,621
So I guess I'm just surprised to see that we aren't actually going to go forward with something as important as a new website.

1005
01:48:29,497 --> 01:48:34,681
It again ties into SOA and the family and community engagement.

1006
01:48:34,801 --> 01:48:48,151
I mean, if the community is told to go to mps or metropublicschools.org or whatever it is, .com, I forget now suddenly, and they go there and they can't find what they're looking for, then it doesn't matter what we're doing.

1007
01:48:48,771 --> 01:48:50,673
It's literally the same as not doing it.

1008
01:48:51,633 --> 01:48:59,159
And I guess I'm just really surprised that our plan is to get a part-time

1009
01:49:00,217 --> 01:49:10,341
webmaster, it just seems like, you know, throwing a couple of pennies at your retirement and hoping in a couple of years, you're going to be okay.

1010
01:49:10,681 --> 01:49:12,942
It's not going to really solve the problem.

1011
01:49:14,062 --> 01:49:18,504
Well, Mr. Sarkis, if I could just respond to the website questions.

1012
01:49:19,564 --> 01:49:27,087
I think that there's no, I think there's broad agreement that the website has to function differently.

1013
01:49:27,447 --> 01:49:29,308
And I think- May I interrupt Mr. Murphy?

1014
01:49:30,021 --> 01:49:31,722
it doesn't have to function differently.

1015
01:49:32,502 --> 01:49:34,482
It's a collection of static web pages.

1016
01:49:34,903 --> 01:49:37,023
That's not a website in this day and age.

1017
01:49:37,063 --> 01:49:38,984
And it hasn't been for like 20 years.

1018
01:49:39,544 --> 01:49:42,225
It should not be a collection of static web pages.

1019
01:49:43,045 --> 01:49:44,886
So we don't need it to function differently.

1020
01:49:44,926 --> 01:49:48,487
We need an entirely new platform from beginning to end.

1021
01:49:49,507 --> 01:49:53,448
And I just can't agree that it needs to function differently.

1022
01:49:53,608 --> 01:49:56,089
That's tiny little iterative changes

1023
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:01,341
And I don't know how many emails you've gotten from me, but I can't find this link.

1024
01:50:01,421 --> 01:50:05,382
Throughout the pandemic, every week we were gonna get an update on the current numbers.

1025
01:50:06,243 --> 01:50:10,184
And I emailed many times, like, I don't see the update.

1026
01:50:10,324 --> 01:50:11,584
I found the page actually.

1027
01:50:11,724 --> 01:50:12,684
And you're like, it's there.

1028
01:50:12,704 --> 01:50:18,806
And it's not that it started getting there when I expected to see it.

1029
01:50:18,926 --> 01:50:26,068
I just gave up asking you because I felt bad about the fact that you all had a lot of other work to do than service me as a school committee member.

1030
01:50:26,704 --> 01:50:27,024
So.

1031
01:50:28,005 --> 01:50:32,028
Well, again, I'm not going to back up my comment that the website has to function differently.

1032
01:50:32,128 --> 01:50:41,515
I mean, the extent to which it has to function differently, I think, is something that, frankly, the committee can decide as to where it wants to prioritize this.

1033
01:50:42,976 --> 01:50:51,121
I think that the working group that we've established is a reflection of the sort of urgency we recognize that it has to go.

1034
01:50:51,882 --> 01:50:54,544
The budget priorities that are coming before you

1035
01:50:55,082 --> 01:51:05,009
have been informed by a desire to fund what is going to have the most direct impact on students as a result of coming out of the pandemic.

1036
01:51:05,389 --> 01:51:18,038
And while I agree with you, I think there's elements of the website that you can even say are embarrassing because it is a series of disconnected pages and some of which appear to be from an old obsolete website.

1037
01:51:18,298 --> 01:51:19,079
That's a problem.

1038
01:51:19,719 --> 01:51:22,381
I'm not sure it's a problem that has a direct impact on kids.

1039
01:51:22,802 --> 01:51:24,763
I think it's frustrating for community members

1040
01:51:25,147 --> 01:51:26,428
I think it's frustrating for families.

1041
01:51:26,808 --> 01:51:28,909
And I think for that reason, we should fix it.

1042
01:51:29,950 --> 01:51:39,676
But with regard to like where it falls on the ultimate sort of pyramid of priorities, I would say that I don't think it rises to the level of many of the other things that we've talked about.

1043
01:51:39,896 --> 01:51:48,062
But at the same time, I would also say that both communications, family engagement, all those reasons that you pointed out too, it's a sensible priority.

1044
01:51:48,082 --> 01:51:55,046
So if the committee wants us to essentially shell the sort of ad hoc plan that we currently have,

1045
01:51:56,169 --> 01:52:00,892
to revamp the website, I think that's absolutely a right to do that.

1046
01:52:01,572 --> 01:52:13,198
I think it's our obligation, though, to say that in the context of this, it's not something I would recommend funding before we address some of these other issues that have the more directing.

1047
01:52:13,938 --> 01:52:20,321
If this were a different time, if we weren't coming out of the two years of significant instructional disruption, I'm not sure I would feel that way.

1048
01:52:20,962 --> 01:52:23,283
I might say that this website is just too

1049
01:52:24,019 --> 01:52:26,600
infuriating and we've got to come up with a better information system.

1050
01:52:27,441 --> 01:52:40,426
And the only thing I would say is that I'm not sure that, while you're right, it is a website that functions from an earlier time, the utility of websites, I think, has evolved to some extent as well.

1051
01:52:40,486 --> 01:52:48,670
And so it might be the case that what we really want to be moving toward strategically is just a simpler website that can drive people toward

1052
01:52:49,275 --> 01:52:52,616
whether it be social media feeds or other places to get information.

1053
01:52:52,636 --> 01:53:03,759
I'm not sure that the vision of the 1995 website vision, which is, you're right, is largely what this is derivative of, I think was you'd go to the website and everything would be there.

1054
01:53:04,519 --> 01:53:14,802
And I think that that's why it functions as poorly as it does, is that we're still operating as if that's where everybody gets their information and we might as well be printing it in a newspaper that doesn't exist.

1055
01:53:15,350 --> 01:53:22,853
And so I think that we have to sort of adopt that sort of strategy piece, and then we can decide like how to make that investment.

1056
01:53:23,133 --> 01:53:28,295
The working group is to just get to a place of functionality, which I think is critical.

1057
01:53:30,796 --> 01:53:31,776
Okay, thank you.

1058
01:53:32,056 --> 01:53:35,477
And I'll just ask one more technology question before passing it off to somebody else.

1059
01:53:35,537 --> 01:53:35,817
Oops.

1060
01:53:36,478 --> 01:53:42,980
I have two, I just kept to get them off the page.

1061
01:53:43,896 --> 01:53:49,520
How many full-time employees are dedicated to supporting staff and students' technology needs on a day-to-day basis?

1062
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:58,005
You know, the help desk, the people that are like, go over because the cable was broken or the device isn't functioning.

1063
01:53:58,506 --> 01:54:03,909
And do we, when you answer that question, do we have any sense of turn?

1064
01:54:03,949 --> 01:54:07,892
I mean, if that, there's not seven, I'm assuming.

1065
01:54:08,292 --> 01:54:12,295
So when you're at the Columbus and there is not somebody there,

1066
01:54:13,619 --> 01:54:21,524
does that mean a teacher is without a computer or the services they need for half the class a day?

1067
01:54:22,565 --> 01:54:33,212
What are our turnaround times on that given the answer you're gonna give me around how many people are full-time dedicated to just supporting the technology needs of our students and staff?

1068
01:54:36,073 --> 01:54:36,894
Well, I can answer that.

1069
01:54:36,994 --> 01:54:43,078
So there are two full-time technology support personnel.

1070
01:54:43,670 --> 01:54:49,333
right now that's separate from our Google admin or our device distribution.

1071
01:54:49,833 --> 01:54:53,535
This year, all of our library staff have essentially become tech support.

1072
01:54:54,136 --> 01:54:58,578
So they've been doing all sorts of troubleshooting and exchange and that kind of thing.

1073
01:54:58,638 --> 01:55:03,140
So right now there are people in every building for those kinds of devices.

1074
01:55:03,260 --> 01:55:09,924
So there are two, but in general and going forward, there are two full-time technology support and the hope is that we're adding one.

1075
01:55:12,172 --> 01:55:15,515
In an ideal world, we'd have one every building, but we'll take one more.

1076
01:55:15,535 --> 01:55:21,180
In terms of the turnaround, actually, all things considered, we were incredibly short-staffed this year.

1077
01:55:22,261 --> 01:55:24,563
We did lose one of our tech support.

1078
01:55:25,383 --> 01:55:33,670
But we did have our staff, both our technology teachers and our library staff really stepped up to cover that hole this year.

1079
01:55:33,810 --> 01:55:36,493
And so the needs got met.

1080
01:55:36,553 --> 01:55:38,955
Our help desk calls are actually surprisingly low.

1081
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:42,961
And we do absolutely prioritize what's in front.

1082
01:55:43,041 --> 01:55:48,922
So it is the students, it's the teaching that goes in front, and then it's perhaps an administrator printer.

1083
01:55:49,022 --> 01:55:53,463
But, you know, it is always that is the priority, and that is it always front and center.

1084
01:55:53,503 --> 01:55:56,584
So we've done pretty well, all things considered.

1085
01:55:56,924 --> 01:56:00,445
But we will definitely need, we have a lot more technology than we did before.

1086
01:56:01,265 --> 01:56:03,887
we need to take our library staff back to being library staff.

1087
01:56:03,987 --> 01:56:13,993
And so beyond, they will still do some library media support in terms of Chromebook management and that kind of thing, but in terms of actual hardware support, we'd like to get them out of that business a little bit.

1088
01:56:15,454 --> 01:56:15,834
Thank you.

1089
01:56:16,074 --> 01:56:20,157
And I'll ask one more quick question since I think it's an easier one, quicker one answer.

1090
01:56:20,457 --> 01:56:21,958
Those, the answers are great.

1091
01:56:22,018 --> 01:56:25,160
And I'm glad adding one is a 50% increase.

1092
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:27,242
And I think that that's a good trend.

1093
01:56:29,385 --> 01:56:34,628
We have a number of technology security practices that are pretty distressing.

1094
01:56:35,629 --> 01:56:43,674
I mean, I work for a large healthcare company and of course we have a lot of money we spend on security, technology security.

1095
01:56:44,434 --> 01:56:48,097
I've never changed my password since I joined the Medford School Committee.

1096
01:56:49,457 --> 01:56:57,362
And I'm gonna bet that some of the staff that's been here for a decade or more has never changed their password or had to.

1097
01:56:59,108 --> 01:57:07,996
Do we have anybody or any committee or group working on fixing what are frankly pretty glaring holes?

1098
01:57:08,336 --> 01:57:16,362
I have to acknowledge, if you have password resets every 90 days or six months, you need staff to do it.

1099
01:57:16,402 --> 01:57:18,524
That's not like a staff free policy.

1100
01:57:18,544 --> 01:57:20,386
You just click a button and boom, it's there.

1101
01:57:20,826 --> 01:57:23,268
It's gonna require support staff.

1102
01:57:23,308 --> 01:57:27,772
So I understand from a priority perspective, adding that right now might not be a goal,

1103
01:57:28,667 --> 01:57:39,415
It seems like we need to outline where are our security, technology security gaps, and what's the plan where, is there a plan and where are we gonna get, how are we gonna get there?

1104
01:57:39,435 --> 01:57:45,899
I think I'd just like to say that we, this is a priority and it's something that we're working on.

1105
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:57,768
I think for reasons I'm sure that you know, Mr. Rosado, I'm probably not gonna go into articulating exactly what those vulnerabilities are at the moment, but it is something that we're looking to address and have addressed some of them,

1106
01:57:58,480 --> 01:57:58,620
Um.

1107
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:06,702
Sort of, uh, behind the scenes, but something that will be working on it further in the coming weeks and months.

1108
01:58:07,863 --> 01:58:08,163
Thank you.

1109
01:58:08,183 --> 01:58:12,504
Can you can we get an update in the next when we have a next executive session planned?

1110
01:58:12,524 --> 01:58:15,145
I don't want a special one just for that, but.

1111
01:58:16,045 --> 01:58:16,865
Yeah, I would.

1112
01:58:17,145 --> 01:58:21,647
I probably, uh, I don't know exactly what our next executive session is, and it might I might

1113
01:58:26,974 --> 01:58:32,398
progress to report on here because of the number of other issues we've got stacked up in the executive session world.

1114
01:58:32,478 --> 01:58:36,580
But I certainly think it's something we can update you on in the near future.

1115
01:58:37,481 --> 01:58:37,801
Thank you.

1116
01:58:41,784 --> 01:58:42,224
Member Graham.

1117
01:58:44,943 --> 01:58:45,343
Thank you.

1118
01:58:47,624 --> 01:58:56,149
Regarding the instructional technology narrative, I think there is a typo in the number of librarian staff.

1119
01:58:56,689 --> 01:59:03,953
My understanding is the elementary school, there is a half-time librarian for four elementary schools, not a full FTE.

1120
01:59:04,033 --> 01:59:04,794
Is that still true?

1121
01:59:04,814 --> 01:59:07,115
It is still true.

1122
01:59:07,135 --> 01:59:09,876
If this doesn't reflect that, that's something we can adjust.

1123
01:59:10,817 --> 01:59:14,299
Yeah, there is an error in that staffing, actually, that total staffing.

1124
01:59:15,462 --> 01:59:29,994
And I also wanted to comment about the fact that there is no plan in the short or long term to increase the level of librarian support, which is to the detriment of the district.

1125
01:59:30,514 --> 01:59:35,438
I just, I can't believe that nobody is asking for more librarian support.

1126
01:59:35,478 --> 01:59:39,962
There's 2000 elementary school students and we have a half time librarian to cover.

1127
01:59:40,742 --> 01:59:42,043
2000 elementary school students.

1128
01:59:42,463 --> 01:59:50,428
There's no way that that what that halftime person can can instruct meaningful curriculum at all.

1129
01:59:51,229 --> 01:59:54,871
There's certainly no way she can build it, which is what I understand is supposed to be happening.

1130
01:59:56,692 --> 02:00:02,056
The paraprofessionals are not the people who are supposed to be taking the those reins.

1131
02:00:02,256 --> 02:00:08,340
So I think we have a significant problem and a massive understaffing in that

1132
02:00:09,083 --> 02:00:14,189
space and I'm a little bit surprised to see that once again this year we aren't asking for anything more.

1133
02:00:14,209 --> 02:00:20,377
I also wanted to point out that

1134
02:00:24,389 --> 02:00:30,115
I am not in support of spending district funds for resources who don't have professional qualifications to do work.

1135
02:00:30,836 --> 02:00:47,012
So if we are paying people to lead working groups around our website and the quality of the content, I would ask that we spend it on somebody with professional qualifications in that area and not just simply somebody who happens

1136
02:00:48,226 --> 02:00:52,790
have been around the district and happens to be available to do the work.

1137
02:00:53,530 --> 02:00:59,275
It's an art and a trade unto itself, just like public education is.

1138
02:00:59,375 --> 02:01:06,621
So I want to see us spend the district's money wisely, and I frankly don't think that's a wise investment.

1139
02:01:08,750 --> 02:01:20,537
I would also say that the district can't, in all fairness, think that they can meet the expectations of the consumer of the website without engaging the consumers.

1140
02:01:20,597 --> 02:01:24,079
So again, I'm not sure what the objectives of that working group are.

1141
02:01:24,099 --> 02:01:34,186
I know that we passed unanimously a resolution to have a cohesive strategic plan around communication

1142
02:01:35,134 --> 02:01:41,656
and I don't think that we're headed in the right direction at all to get there based on what I heard tonight.

1143
02:01:43,356 --> 02:01:51,898
And then the other comment that I'll make is I am all for a reorganization that allows us to prioritize a family engagement person.

1144
02:01:51,918 --> 02:01:59,020
I look forward to seeing the job description so that we can all agree on what the professional qualifications of that role are and

1145
02:02:00,620 --> 02:02:21,469
If that means that in order to fill the role, we need to look outside the organization to find someone with the proper qualifications, professionally speaking, that we should do that and we should not just be looking to shuffle people around to give them new titles if they don't have the professional qualifications.

1146
02:02:21,509 --> 02:02:24,590
So I just want to make sure we take that hiring seriously because it's critically important

1147
02:02:26,150 --> 02:02:31,692
Communication has been a problem in our district since I have been a parent in the district.

1148
02:02:32,212 --> 02:02:37,294
And we've taken a lot of measures this year to improve things, but there is still a long way to go.

1149
02:02:37,394 --> 02:02:43,096
And without the right expertise, we are not gonna be able to continue moving forward.

1150
02:02:45,165 --> 02:02:48,266
And then my last question, actually I have two more questions.

1151
02:02:49,146 --> 02:02:53,207
It was my understanding that we had to move MCAS at the high school because there was an internet issue.

1152
02:02:53,327 --> 02:03:06,071
So are we, if the capital expenditures that were outlined tonight come to reality, will we not have those problems in the future?

1153
02:03:07,552 --> 02:03:08,232
Is this enough?

1154
02:03:09,432 --> 02:03:12,353
I think that we'll be better positioned, but since,

1155
02:03:12,978 --> 02:03:22,245
The internet went down during the MCAS presentation as the result of an individual or individuals intentionally disabling the network.

1156
02:03:23,205 --> 02:03:30,871
There's no security system that we can put in place that will change everyone in the world's motives.

1157
02:03:31,111 --> 02:03:36,455
So I don't think there's any such thing as an airtight guarantee that something we do will prevent that.

1158
02:03:36,515 --> 02:03:39,177
But certainly the point of prioritizing

1159
02:03:39,772 --> 02:03:45,934
these enhanced security systems will be to diminish the prospect of that type of disruption.

1160
02:03:45,974 --> 02:03:48,034
And it's something that we take extremely seriously.

1161
02:03:48,134 --> 02:03:54,316
But I don't want to say that if we spend X number of dollars, no one will ever interfere with the system again.

1162
02:03:54,396 --> 02:04:01,137
But we've got to get to a better place because the frequency of the disruptions that we've experienced over the course of the last year are totally unacceptable.

1163
02:04:01,798 --> 02:04:04,778
And that's true whether we're taking the MCAS exam or not.

1164
02:04:05,579 --> 02:04:05,999
And so that's it.

1165
02:04:09,115 --> 02:04:10,755
point of information.

1166
02:04:11,675 --> 02:04:12,076
Thank you.

1167
02:04:12,876 --> 02:04:18,337
Mr. Murphy, are you saying that the disruption was an intentional act?

1168
02:04:18,757 --> 02:04:21,257
And if so, why were we not notified?

1169
02:04:21,277 --> 02:04:31,639
I can't I can't speak to the notification, but probably because we were attempting to respond to the situation and get the gas administration completed.

1170
02:04:31,739 --> 02:04:34,040
But I

1171
02:04:36,819 --> 02:04:41,649
Not really point of information, but I would hope we can get an update at the next school committee meeting, because this is news to me.

1172
02:04:45,036 --> 02:04:45,436
Member Graham?

1173
02:04:47,376 --> 02:05:08,748
Yeah, and I guess I have some questions about whether we have the right expertise in-house to make sure that what we're saying is how we should spend capital funds is actually going to get us the results that we need, or if we need some other expertise to help advise about what is the right path forward.

1174
02:05:09,728 --> 02:05:12,410
I don't know, do other school districts have

1175
02:05:13,390 --> 02:05:15,852
to shut down MCAS because of a hacker.

1176
02:05:15,872 --> 02:05:17,754
I haven't heard that.

1177
02:05:17,854 --> 02:05:30,646
It doesn't mean it's not happening everywhere, but I just feel like there's some stone unturned that we need to get to so that we can have a real plan that says this is what

1178
02:05:31,916 --> 02:05:37,698
we need to make this building viable, to make our network viable, to make instruction viable.

1179
02:05:37,738 --> 02:05:43,120
And I'm just not convinced that we are there yet.

1180
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:53,404
So I don't know what that person's expertise would be or how or who it is that we might need, but I think we need some assistance at this point.

1181
02:05:53,424 --> 02:05:57,306
Like we've been at this for a year and we still have students who it's not just,

1182
02:05:58,126 --> 02:06:18,417
like that it's hard for them to get online like they're at home learning remotely because they cannot access their their remote teachers so that's that's a fact it is happening um we've been at this for a year and it's it's dramatically improved but it's still just this huge problem and we have to we have to

1183
02:06:19,508 --> 02:06:21,429
fix it completely at some point.

1184
02:06:21,549 --> 02:06:30,415
And I would like to see us do that expeditiously because we sort of are already past the window of opportunity there for our students.

1185
02:06:31,036 --> 02:06:37,620
And then my final question is, when does the school committee get to know about the capital funds that have been appropriated to the school district?

1186
02:06:39,642 --> 02:06:48,488
So that's one question, but there are a number of questions I think embedded in the member Graham's comments that I'd like to respond to.

1187
02:06:49,099 --> 02:06:51,880
I guess I'll start with the direct question at the end.

1188
02:06:52,420 --> 02:06:56,642
There are no mystery funds that have been appropriated, at least that I am aware of.

1189
02:06:57,162 --> 02:07:13,588
There's the approximately $800,000 in capital funding that was initially appropriated prior to the clarification as to what could be used for CARES Act funding related to the HVAC improvements that were done over the course of the 2021 school year.

1190
02:07:13,928 --> 02:07:15,389
And there's also the 160,000

1191
02:07:18,593 --> 02:07:29,098
or thereabouts appropriation that was made as a result of funding left over from a capital project that we've done several years ago related to the science labs, I believe.

1192
02:07:29,138 --> 02:07:41,044
So when we say that the capital funding that we have, we have current capacity, we're referring to those two pools of money that we've discussed on several occasions in this and other public forums.

1193
02:07:41,925 --> 02:07:48,308
With regard to the question about whether we have the internal expertise, what I would say is that

1194
02:07:48,786 --> 02:08:00,109
If you look at those capital priorities, they are mostly projects in which we will need to put out various requests for proposals or requests for bids that will come in.

1195
02:08:00,269 --> 02:08:05,231
And so none of this is really stuff that we're going to be, quote, doing internally.

1196
02:08:05,271 --> 02:08:15,334
They are all things that we will need to consult with experts on to get appropriate estimates, and then to get bids, and then to consult with in order to pursue those projects.

1197
02:08:18,106 --> 02:08:23,189
I don't know that any of us disagree that this is something that we need outside expertise for.

1198
02:08:23,629 --> 02:08:38,577
And we've had some conversations already with some external partners around potential consulting that can take place over the course of the summer to try to better position us to know exactly what it is that we want proposals and bids for.

1199
02:08:38,657 --> 02:08:47,742
And so I think the reason we're doing that is for the reason that member Graham identifies is that we have to be able to understand that we need to expand our own capacity

1200
02:08:48,163 --> 02:08:52,604
to make sure that we have a full roadmap as to what are the investments we need to make in that regard.

1201
02:08:53,864 --> 02:09:05,466
With regard to the family engagement position, again, we'll speak to this in the reorganization that we're contemplating tomorrow evening, but I just want to be very candid.

1202
02:09:05,706 --> 02:09:11,567
There is internal capacity that we want to recognize that we want to repurpose and we want to put toward this objective.

1203
02:09:11,807 --> 02:09:14,648
And we're doing so not because we're just trying to shuffle people around,

1204
02:09:15,213 --> 02:09:29,916
And I take a little bit of exception at the suggestion that that is either something that the administration would like to do or that the individuals that are willing to serve in this capacity are somehow just being shuffled around to, I guess, give them new assignments or anything like that.

1205
02:09:30,296 --> 02:09:33,117
That is frankly not a good use of their time or ours.

1206
02:09:33,517 --> 02:09:38,198
And it's not something that's going to be incorporated into any of our priorities.

1207
02:09:39,618 --> 02:09:44,939
And frankly, and I say this as someone who frankly, I'm not someone that for better or worse enjoys

1208
02:09:45,860 --> 02:09:48,703
long lasting relationships in this community.

1209
02:09:48,743 --> 02:09:57,470
And I think that there's just not a lot of incentive on the part of the superintendent, myself and other members of the team to shuffle people around.

1210
02:09:57,951 --> 02:10:10,862
We're doing what we think is in the best interest of the community to try to advance the goals that have been expressed by the committee and that are incorporated into each of the budgetary priorities that you're hearing about.

1211
02:10:11,382 --> 02:10:13,064
And that's true, frankly,

1212
02:10:14,054 --> 02:10:15,415
with regard to the website as well.

1213
02:10:16,296 --> 02:10:30,105
I think it may be the case that we need to look at potential external resources to try to revamp, not just the website, but if we're going to invest in that, we want to look at our communication platforms more broadly and how do we best utilize them.

1214
02:10:30,505 --> 02:10:36,129
But to the question of what is the objective of the working group, it is functionality.

1215
02:10:36,670 --> 02:10:41,533
The website, as I think members have pointed out, is not highly functional right now.

1216
02:10:41,782 --> 02:10:47,805
And it has to be addressed, not because I think, frankly, it's going to be the one place that everybody goes for their information.

1217
02:10:47,825 --> 02:10:50,067
I think those days are more or less past.

1218
02:10:50,607 --> 02:10:53,408
But I think it does have to be a reliable source for information.

1219
02:10:53,729 --> 02:10:55,750
It has to be organized in an efficient manner.

1220
02:10:56,170 --> 02:11:04,895
And we need to be able to make sure that all our stakeholders, staff, students, and family are able to utilize that to the best extent possible.

1221
02:11:04,955 --> 02:11:07,396
So that's the objective of that group.

1222
02:11:09,403 --> 02:11:20,848
They've seen some improvements so far, and they have good ideas for what can happen between now and the time where it is a priority that we're able to advance.

1223
02:11:20,888 --> 02:11:24,530
But again, as I said to Mr. Rousseau, it's not that anyone is satisfied.

1224
02:11:24,650 --> 02:11:34,315
If anyone is really happy with the website right now, I think it probably means they haven't surfed the web since the 90s, I guess, is the only way I could see that being the case.

1225
02:11:34,375 --> 02:11:39,197
But I think we do have to look at it in the broader context of everything it is that we are

1226
02:11:39,768 --> 02:11:41,369
we're looking to do.

1227
02:11:43,510 --> 02:11:51,475
So I just want to point out that the communications engagement and strategic planning subcommittee was completely unaware of this working group.

1228
02:11:52,596 --> 02:11:59,280
And I think we've had a lot of discussion in that group about the desire to make the website

1229
02:12:00,040 --> 02:12:02,942
more functional at its minimum.

1230
02:12:03,963 --> 02:12:23,617
So I look forward to a discussion with the working team that's been established that doesn't include the school committee or the public so that we can sort of close that gap because the entire key to an effective website is understanding who you're trying to reach and having a path to like get to them.

1231
02:12:23,877 --> 02:12:26,419
And I don't know how you do that without talking to those people.

1232
02:12:27,358 --> 02:12:31,030
And then, you know, as it relates to making sure we have the right.

1233
02:12:32,941 --> 02:12:44,206
technical expertise to grapple with the realities of, you know, sort of all that we still have to do from a network access and security space.

1234
02:12:45,347 --> 02:12:52,390
It's my impression that Mr. Arena has been working around the clock for the better part of a year and a half now trying to remediate this.

1235
02:12:53,871 --> 02:12:58,072
And that he, you know, simply, we need to make sure he has the support he needs.

1236
02:12:58,112 --> 02:12:59,053
He's one person.

1237
02:13:00,980 --> 02:13:13,524
And if that means we need somebody to help us put together that cohesive plan to execute or to consult, I am in favor of that spending, because I don't think Mr. Arena can do this by himself.

1238
02:13:13,544 --> 02:13:19,706
I think Mr. Arena would concur with that.

1239
02:13:19,746 --> 02:13:20,987
What he can single-handedly do.

1240
02:13:21,047 --> 02:13:27,088
So I appreciate that comment and would agree with it.

1241
02:13:27,208 --> 02:13:27,589
Thank you.

1242
02:13:27,629 --> 02:13:28,389
Yes, I agree.

1243
02:13:29,287 --> 02:13:43,011
I know tomorrow night we have another budget hearing at seven o'clock, and then to recap the entirety of the budget will be June 1st, and I believe the same thing, seven o'clock.

1244
02:13:44,652 --> 02:13:45,512
Motion to adjourn?

1245
02:13:46,432 --> 02:13:54,655
Yep, motion to adjourn, but before we adjourn, I know, I just also want to point out something, Member McLaughlin, you pointed out just about equity

1246
02:13:55,517 --> 02:14:01,481
highlight, you know, the fact that I'm excited athletics will be back up and running full steam ahead.

1247
02:14:02,022 --> 02:14:04,884
Come the fall, our kids obviously need it.

1248
02:14:05,024 --> 02:14:11,389
And it's been nice to see some of their games over the past several weeks and to have these shortened seasons.

1249
02:14:11,449 --> 02:14:16,072
And I know Mr. Maloney has fought to get athletics back on the GBL league.

1250
02:14:16,712 --> 02:14:20,075
But I'm excited about the unified needs champion sports.

1251
02:14:21,092 --> 02:14:30,300
I wanna learn more, so I'm just gonna do that on my own because it's already 9.15, but I'm excited to see what that's all about and try to include that in our budget.

1252
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:36,344
So motion to adjourn by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Van de Kloot.

1253
02:14:36,424 --> 02:14:37,165
Roll call, please.

1254
02:14:38,046 --> 02:14:38,626
Member Graham?

1255
02:14:39,146 --> 02:14:39,407
Yes.

1256
02:14:40,508 --> 02:14:41,068
Member Kretz?

1257
02:14:41,668 --> 02:14:41,889
Yes.

1258
02:14:42,909 --> 02:14:44,090
Member McLaughlin, yes.

1259
02:14:44,611 --> 02:14:45,471
Member McStone?

1260
02:14:45,852 --> 02:14:47,813
