1
00:00:01,165 --> 00:00:12,129
[SPEAKER_10]: The Substance Abuse Coordinator shall report to the Board of Health Director and be responsible for developing and administering a unified substance abuse prevention program in Medford.

2
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:24,253
[SPEAKER_10]: The focus shall be on prevention, intervention services, health policy development, community outreach, and other functions to meet the needs of the community.

3
00:00:25,013 --> 00:00:29,375
[SPEAKER_10]: The coordinator shall also work with local health care providers to gather

4
00:00:30,648 --> 00:00:38,111
[SPEAKER_10]: disseminate information on available substance abuse treatment services and resources in the local area.

5
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:46,134
[SPEAKER_10]: The coordinator shall have a master's degree and be a certified addiction counselor with three to five years experience in counseling services.

6
00:00:46,554 --> 00:00:47,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Counselor Camuso.

7
00:00:47,475 --> 00:00:48,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

8
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:51,636
[SPEAKER_11]: The past couple of years,

9
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,722
[SPEAKER_11]: There has been an increase of substance abuse overdoses and other issues throughout our community.

10
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:23,010
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to have the city solicitor draft an ordinance, putting it into the personnel ordinance section of our local ordinances so that come budget time or come time to do the community development block grant funding, which is going to be in the next month or so, I'm sure we'll be having our portion,

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:43,246
[SPEAKER_11]: that there's an actual ordinance in place, and if the mayor doesn't see fit to sign off on this ordinance, as we all know, a two-thirds vote of this council would be able to override it anyway, if it's something that we all seem serious about, which I'm sure we are based upon the talk around here for the last few weeks.

12
00:01:43,806 --> 00:01:47,327
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to actually make this an ordinance, and if the mayor signs it, great.

13
00:01:47,632 --> 00:01:52,334
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure he will take a hard look at it and if he sees it, that it's a good expenditure.

14
00:01:53,214 --> 00:02:02,658
[SPEAKER_11]: The language that I got for this is based upon the language of all the different surrounding communities that do have a part-time coordinator in their area.

15
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:11,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of the cities I looked at had a minimum of 20 hours per week, but I figured where we have the long day Wednesday, if you could have someone here three days a week.

16
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:15,643
[SPEAKER_11]: And as far as the experience, that would be up to the administration.

17
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:22,553
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just think you need someone that really has experience in the field, and it has to be an appointment that's made with due diligence.

18
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:25,074
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's certainly up to the administration.

19
00:02:25,134 --> 00:02:31,477
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to do this by way of ordinance, so that if the mayor doesn't see fit to do it, he can leave it unfunded in his budget.

20
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:36,980
[SPEAKER_11]: But that will tell us where he really stands on the issue, if there is an ordinance change in the personnel charts.

21
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:42,048
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is a great starting point for our discussions tomorrow night.

22
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:47,370
[SPEAKER_11]: If we want to, I'd like to get the ball rolling with budgets coming up for the ordinance change.

23
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,511
[SPEAKER_11]: But if people want to talk about this further tomorrow night, I would refer this.

24
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:55,293
[SPEAKER_11]: But if people want to vote on this this evening, we can do it this evening too.

25
00:02:55,313 --> 00:03:00,655
[SPEAKER_11]: But I would say time is of the essence, just where budget's starting to roll around and community development block grants.

26
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:04,817
[SPEAKER_11]: But certainly by putting it off one night for further discussion, I'm not opposed to that at all.

27
00:03:05,277 --> 00:03:05,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Council.

28
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:08,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President De La Russa.

29
00:03:08,537 --> 00:03:14,002
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to thank Councilor Camuso for at least thinking about different options.

30
00:03:14,082 --> 00:03:18,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's good to go to other communities and figure out what other communities are doing.

31
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:20,788
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could ask you a question, which communities did you look at?

32
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:21,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know which ones?

33
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Boston's doing something right now.

34
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:29,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Bill Ricka has one in place, as well as Woburn is talking about it right now.

35
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:33,619
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you follow the Northwest Weekly, it's something in the Boston Globe on Sundays.

36
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:54,996
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something that most, I shouldn't say most, that would be speaking out of turn, but a lot of the cities and towns around here are doing similar things, but Billerica really is the leading one around here, and that's former Mayor John Curran out of Woburn, who's in the process, if not, they either just hired the person, or are in the process of hiring them right now.

37
00:03:56,377 --> 00:03:56,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

38
00:03:57,758 --> 00:04:01,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I would suggest we refer to committee only because we are meeting tomorrow, 6 PM.

39
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:11,405
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our health director, which is obviously possibly going to be administering that type of employment.

40
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:17,328
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, I think Penny Bruce will be coming tomorrow from Team Medford and her staff.

41
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:20,370
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a whole host of department heads that can

42
00:04:21,222 --> 00:04:22,463
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of issues.

43
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:25,745
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're going to meet for an hour and a half, two hours tomorrow.

44
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:35,512
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's just kind of going to scratch the surface on prevention, helping families who are struggling with this, helping addicts.

45
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:42,216
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're going to need a lot of time to figure out the problem and how to resolve it.

46
00:04:42,376 --> 00:04:49,581
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure there's going to be many steps of resolving the many issues that go along with addiction and the problems we're facing with overdoses.

47
00:04:50,085 --> 00:04:55,169
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would, I think this is definitely one thing we need to discuss as what, something we can do as a community.

48
00:04:55,309 --> 00:05:03,655
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to hear from, you know, our health director and team Medford to see what they have in place, what they need, and you know, if this is something that will work for Medford.

49
00:05:04,455 --> 00:05:05,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

50
00:05:06,197 --> 00:05:06,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Counsel Penta.

51
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:12,661
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the idea was a good idea, but I think I'll take you up on the second part of the suggestion.

52
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:13,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor.

53
00:05:13,302 --> 00:05:16,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think, um, what's necessary here is to, um,

54
00:05:17,158 --> 00:05:20,539
[SPEAKER_05]: see what comes out of tomorrow night's meeting, just see what we have.

55
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:23,880
[SPEAKER_05]: And then look at the ordinances that might be out there.

56
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:30,042
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the governor has an opiate program that he's embroiling on a statewide basis.

57
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:33,062
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe, once again, looking at making contact with him.

58
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:38,144
[SPEAKER_05]: But since seeing that resolution on there, there's a lady you might want to add to your list.

59
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:41,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And her name is Joanne Peterson.

60
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:44,046
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's the founder and the executive director of Learn to Cope, Inc.

61
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,686
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Learn to Cope, Inc.

62
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:51,808
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have been pretty active on all of this.

63
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:56,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I was contacted by parishioners at St.

64
00:05:56,271 --> 00:06:07,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Joseph Parish for anyone who right now is embroiled with some type of an addiction in your family, or the addiction yourself being the individual, that on every Friday at 11 o'clock in the lower

65
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:13,664
[SPEAKER_05]: chapel of the church.

66
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:21,151
[SPEAKER_05]: They have an addiction program that runs anywhere from 11 to 12 o'clock on, and it's open to the public for anyone, no matter what.

67
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:22,472
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't make any difference what you are.

68
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:26,256
[SPEAKER_05]: They're there to help anyone for solace or for whatever it might be.

69
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:27,037
[SPEAKER_05]: That's ongoing.

70
00:06:28,198 --> 00:06:34,904
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to check them out, that's adoration24sj.comcast.net.

71
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:37,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking with some of the folks in the governor's

72
00:06:38,277 --> 00:06:40,978
[SPEAKER_05]: opiate program, and they're taking this, as you know, very seriously.

73
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:42,898
[SPEAKER_05]: This is his number two priority when he came on.

74
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,260
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we can get a wealth of information not only from them.

75
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:58,123
[SPEAKER_05]: I think to put the ordinance together, right now it just might be just a spec premature because the direction that you'd want the ordinance to go in, is it going to be basically a conduit?

76
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:01,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to be a person that's actually going to be able to resolve the problem or not?

77
00:07:01,604 --> 00:07:02,744
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be a two-pronged approach.

78
00:07:03,364 --> 00:07:05,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like the idea that we're taking the first step forward,

79
00:07:06,313 --> 00:07:13,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I think maybe after a couple of meetings, once you see what's on the table, I think you can have a better idea of making the audience become more forceful.

80
00:07:13,878 --> 00:07:15,219
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would support that.

81
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,122
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, once again, that lady is very helpful as far as this goes.

82
00:07:22,143 --> 00:07:23,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Pinto.

83
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:23,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

84
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:25,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

85
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:27,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Camuso, for filing this resolution.

86
00:07:28,888 --> 00:07:32,490
[SPEAKER_07]: I always think it's a good idea when it's time to put your money where your mouth is,

87
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:35,676
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think this is a perfect example of that.

88
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:43,304
[SPEAKER_07]: If we are going to take the issue of addiction in our community seriously, I think we need to dedicate a revenue stream to that.

89
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:53,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, we've had a lot of discussions over the past couple of weeks about putting a line item in the budget, about inviting certain individuals down here to provide us with their expertise.

90
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:56,176
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think this is a great start to the discussion, Mr. President.

91
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:07,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I think right now we have the unique opportunity because we have certain services that are lacking to really tailor programming to figure out what's exactly going to work in our community.

92
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Not what's going to work next door across the street or up on Beacon Hill, but what's going to work here for Medford, Mr. President.

93
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I too would support further discussion of this matter in the subcommittee process.

94
00:08:17,118 --> 00:08:31,185
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I feel as though it's a great idea, and as soon as we shape this thing to reflect what our wants, needs, and desires are here in the city of Medford, and what exactly it is going to take to assist those that are struggling, you know, I'll be supporting this wholeheartedly, Mr. President.

95
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:34,346
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a great idea, and I commend Councilor Camuso for putting his money where his mouth is.

96
00:08:35,547 --> 00:08:35,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

97
00:08:36,727 --> 00:08:38,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight, Councilor Marks.

98
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:45,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I would like to thank Councilor Camuso for his continued efforts on this issue.

99
00:08:47,376 --> 00:09:00,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be helpful, as Councilor Knight just mentioned, about knowing the revenue stream, and maybe we should do our own homework to find out what exactly, and I don't know if you've already found out, but what a position of this would cost.

100
00:09:01,518 --> 00:09:07,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that'd be helpful in making a decision, at least going forward and asking the mayor to look into it.

101
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:16,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I know there are a number of initiatives currently taking place within our community that's on a tri-city level,

102
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:31,199
[SPEAKER_03]: that deals with sting operations when people are serving underage, you know, people in the community in different establishments, kids buying cigarettes that are underage.

103
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:38,022
[SPEAKER_03]: And that operation has been a tri-city with Method, Everett, and Malden.

104
00:09:38,582 --> 00:09:45,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe we can look at combining efforts when it comes to this substance abuse coordinator.

105
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:57,847
[SPEAKER_03]: and see what other surrounding communities are doing, and it might be worthwhile to take a program and create something that currently exists on a different level, but maybe expand it to the other communities as well.

106
00:09:57,947 --> 00:10:13,854
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would just offer that as a suggestion, but this is definitely a worthwhile initiative and something that's, at least from my initial discussions in the community, is warranted at this point.

107
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:15,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councillor Marks.

108
00:10:15,853 --> 00:10:20,054
[SPEAKER_10]: So, on the motion of Councillor Camuso.

109
00:10:23,594 --> 00:10:26,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much to all my council colleagues.

110
00:10:26,155 --> 00:10:27,955
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's great to send this to subcommittee.

111
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a couple of points that I'd just like to add to this.

112
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:37,277
[SPEAKER_11]: This isn't specific to the large opiate addiction that we currently have in our community.

113
00:10:37,677 --> 00:10:43,498
[SPEAKER_11]: This is also for treatment, people that may be suffering from using other substances that may be drugs,

114
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,103
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's more of a substance abuse coordinator for all substances.

115
00:10:50,164 --> 00:10:50,904
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the first thing.

116
00:10:51,404 --> 00:11:00,070
[SPEAKER_11]: The second thing is, the mayor always saw fit that it was a very important position in our community when his friend Mr. Averbrook had the job of Medford Saving Lives director.

117
00:11:00,551 --> 00:11:08,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, due to the untiming passing of Ben, who was very well respected in this community, that job has not been filled in some years.

118
00:11:09,957 --> 00:11:14,280
[SPEAKER_11]: This may be an opportunity where the person that does this job can also encompass

119
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:21,812
[SPEAKER_11]: the Medford Saving Lives program, which has been left unfilled by the mayor for several years now.

120
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:28,594
[SPEAKER_11]: And then last but not least, one thing that I know that is a huge thing when it comes to substance abuse, it's the beds out there.

121
00:11:29,014 --> 00:11:29,654
[SPEAKER_11]: It's for treatment.

122
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:34,455
[SPEAKER_11]: We all know Long Island just closed due to the bridge situation.

123
00:11:34,935 --> 00:11:37,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor Walsh had to take that out of service.

124
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:40,857
[SPEAKER_11]: But the biggest thing, I think, if this comes forward,

125
00:11:41,775 --> 00:12:09,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, not the biggest thing, because it's a unified approach with all the different areas, treatment, education, prevention, and intervention services, but an open dialogue between the community and the area hospitals to find out what resources are available on a given day, because all too often, someone's ready to make that step to go into a detox center or a hospital, and unless they're dual diagnosis with a psychiatric problem as well as a substance abuse problem, they just aren't the beds out there.

126
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:18,455
[SPEAKER_11]: exact right time where they say, oh yes, come on over to McLean Hospital, come on over here, come to Whittier Pavilion, whatever hospital it may be.

127
00:12:18,915 --> 00:12:28,281
[SPEAKER_11]: But an ongoing dialogue between the local hospitals and the city so that you know and you have a count of what resources are available at that time.

128
00:12:28,921 --> 00:12:34,545
[SPEAKER_11]: The second thing is the continuum of care right now at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and Hallmark Health.

129
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:37,467
[SPEAKER_11]: They're doing a pilot program right now under a grant.

130
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:39,588
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure most of us are aware of it.

131
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,391
[SPEAKER_11]: where they're actually, they're focusing on back pain.

132
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:51,476
[SPEAKER_11]: When someone comes in with back pain, and back pain is one of those things that you really can't diagnose, but when someone comes in and they're in severe pain, they're in severe pain.

133
00:12:52,256 --> 00:13:07,184
[SPEAKER_11]: But Hallmark's approach in their continuum of care at this point, and they're studying it in a trial moving forward, they're given a maximum of three days worth of painkillers, and then they have to follow up with their primary care or a specialist.

134
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:09,805
[SPEAKER_11]: So Hallmark Health is definitely

135
00:13:10,178 --> 00:13:10,859
[SPEAKER_11]: in the forefront.

136
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:17,303
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're going to hear a little bit more from Middlesex District Attorney Marion Ryan soon on this issue.

137
00:13:17,644 --> 00:13:23,628
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't speak for her, but I think that she's acknowledged that this is a huge problem in this area.

138
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:31,174
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think they'll be focused around here a little bit in the near future.

139
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:36,678
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other thing is too, and I'll discuss this tomorrow night, the Narcan,

140
00:13:37,327 --> 00:13:41,430
[SPEAKER_11]: which we all know is the substance for, it's actually for opiates.

141
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,553
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that's something that we should work.

142
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:54,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever it may be, if it's through contract negotiations, whether it's through, whatever the avenues are, we should look to make sure that our professionals have access to that.

143
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,324
[SPEAKER_11]: And if it means contract negotiations and doing it, then so be it.

144
00:14:01,804 --> 00:14:04,666
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is all stuff we can talk about tomorrow night.

145
00:14:05,097 --> 00:14:09,880
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just want to reiterate, I thank my council colleagues for taking this very, very serious.

146
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,521
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're all on the same page.

147
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:21,647
[SPEAKER_11]: We realize that alcohol and other substances is a part of this community, that we want to be there and help people out when they've surrendered to this awful disease.

148
00:14:22,768 --> 00:14:23,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councillor.

149
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:33,014
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion to send this to the Committee of the Whole tomorrow night by Councillor Camuso, seconded by Vice President Lungo-Kern, Councillor Caviello.

150
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:34,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

151
00:14:34,132 --> 00:14:38,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I want to thank my colleague for bringing this up to a head.

152
00:14:38,915 --> 00:14:41,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that we could vote on this tomorrow night.

153
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:48,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to see something like this languishing committee for week after week before we get anything done.

154
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:58,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there's anybody that's sitting in the back of this rail here that hasn't had someone that they know, whether it be family or friends, that's been touched by some type of addiction.

155
00:14:59,346 --> 00:14:59,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I have.

156
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:00,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't speak for others.

157
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:08,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if we've reached out to McLean Hospital, they're right down the street in Belmont.

158
00:15:09,236 --> 00:15:17,843
[SPEAKER_04]: If partners are serious about coming into the community, that might be part of their little help to this community in getting that done.

159
00:15:18,103 --> 00:15:23,908
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I would hope that we can talk about this tomorrow night, and I hope tomorrow night's discussion is fruitful.

160
00:15:24,588 --> 00:15:29,632
[SPEAKER_04]: And we actually accomplished something other than sitting around just telling stories about how bad people are.

161
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:35,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I, I want, I want tomorrow night to be a full working meeting that maybe some results will come out of.

162
00:15:36,272 --> 00:15:36,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

163
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:37,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

164
00:15:37,712 --> 00:15:37,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

165
00:15:38,013 --> 00:15:38,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor.

166
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:39,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Pinto.

167
00:15:39,553 --> 00:15:41,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether you want to put this as a B paper or not.

168
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:46,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, when Councilor Camuso mentioned NACON, I believe that that was brought up at the last time we met here.

169
00:15:46,456 --> 00:15:52,939
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe that there's already been a niche, a first meeting that's taken place between fire EMTs and police folks on this matter.

170
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:59,582
[SPEAKER_05]: So could we get an update just where is the city of Medford on this issue of NACON and are they going to provide it for the,

171
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:02,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Police, fire, and emergency services here in the city.

172
00:16:03,183 --> 00:16:03,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Not cam, not cam.

173
00:16:04,003 --> 00:16:05,403
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that will be part of our committee.

174
00:16:06,223 --> 00:16:11,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I want to make this a separate paper because if this is already something that's ongoing in the works, I think we should be apprised of it.

175
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:21,847
[SPEAKER_05]: All three of them, emergency responders, fire police, and EMTs.

176
00:16:22,927 --> 00:16:25,687
[SPEAKER_10]: So for the big paper by Councilor Patu, you have that, Mr. Clerk.

177
00:16:27,008 --> 00:16:27,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

178
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:46,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, if I may be so bold to ask, several weeks back, we did request some information from our first responders here in the community, providing us with some data relative to the number of overdoses that have occurred in 2013, 2014, and year to date, related to opiates.

179
00:16:46,286 --> 00:16:49,647
[SPEAKER_07]: And I haven't seen any of that come across my desk yet, Mr. President.

180
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:50,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering if you might have seen it.

181
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:55,250
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't received any communique case, but we'll hopefully be updated.

182
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,311
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe they were holding the presentation.

183
00:16:57,902 --> 00:16:58,663
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, for tomorrow night.

184
00:16:59,023 --> 00:16:59,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.

185
00:16:59,323 --> 00:16:59,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

186
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:19,261
[SPEAKER_10]: So, uh, on the B paper offered by a council Penta that the, um, uh, department heads, the particularly the fire chief, police chief and representatives from, uh, Armstrong ambulance, uh, update the council or on, uh, their deliberations regarding the use of Narcan.

187
00:17:20,342 --> 00:17:22,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President has been requested.

188
00:17:25,173 --> 00:17:30,194
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, it's my understanding that the EMTs and Armstrong Ambulance do carry the NACA.

189
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:34,635
[SPEAKER_07]: But in terms of public safety officials at this point in time, I don't believe they do.

190
00:17:34,695 --> 00:17:37,375
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe they're in ongoing contract negotiations and discussions thereof.

191
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:38,975
[SPEAKER_07]: But that can be clarified.

192
00:17:38,995 --> 00:17:43,736
[SPEAKER_07]: But as far as Armstrong Ambulance, I'm certain that they are carrying NACA.

193
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:44,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

194
00:17:44,536 --> 00:17:45,497
[SPEAKER_07]: So Mr. Clerk, would you like to roll?

195
00:17:45,517 --> 00:17:45,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

196
00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:47,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Camuso.

197
00:17:47,197 --> 00:17:51,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we also ask the same question if Councilor Penta's okay to ask the DA's office and the state police?

198
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:53,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we have a lot of areas in this community.

199
00:17:53,962 --> 00:17:59,485
[SPEAKER_11]: that are patrolled by the state police, and I know we have had overdoses up at Mystic Lakes, up at the Sheepfold, and different areas.

200
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:08,570
[SPEAKER_11]: So that may be additional numbers that we're not necessarily looking at, because they don't necessarily all the time call EMS, as you know.

201
00:18:09,531 --> 00:18:11,892
[SPEAKER_11]: People refuse it, then they get arrested.

202
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:16,235
[SPEAKER_11]: As amended by Councilor Camuso.

203
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:16,975
[SPEAKER_09]: All set?

204
00:18:17,856 --> 00:18:18,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso?

205
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:19,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

206
00:18:19,456 --> 00:18:20,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caviolo?

207
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:20,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

208
00:18:21,117 --> 00:18:21,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

209
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:21,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

210
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Langel-Kern.

211
00:18:23,511 --> 00:18:23,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

212
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:25,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

213
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:25,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

214
00:18:26,152 --> 00:18:26,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Penta.

215
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:26,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

216
00:18:28,354 --> 00:18:28,974
[SPEAKER_09]: President DelaRusso.

217
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:29,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

218
00:18:30,135 --> 00:18:30,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven in favor.

219
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:31,816
[SPEAKER_10]: None absent.

220
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,157
[SPEAKER_10]: B paper passes.

221
00:18:33,517 --> 00:18:41,023
[SPEAKER_10]: And on the main motion of Councilor Camuso, offered for approval by Councilor Camuso, seconded by Vice President Langel-Kern.

222
00:18:41,523 --> 00:18:44,505
[SPEAKER_10]: A roll call as well to send this to Committee of the Whole.

223
00:18:45,806 --> 00:18:46,867
[SPEAKER_10]: No roll call requested.

224
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:48,613
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

225
00:18:48,993 --> 00:18:51,194
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

226
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

227
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,716
[SPEAKER_10]: 15-096 offered by Councilor Camuso.

228
00:18:55,256 --> 00:19:09,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Be resolved that the Mayor, Michael J. McGlynn, put together a mentoring program to pair youngsters in Medford with caring adults who are committed, reliable, and responsible to help young people in our community succeed.

229
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:10,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Camuso.

230
00:19:10,802 --> 00:19:12,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

231
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:13,143
[SPEAKER_11]: The last few

232
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:20,090
[SPEAKER_11]: months, last weeks, we've been focused on other areas that we just discussed and other things that have been important in this community.

233
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:39,895
[SPEAKER_11]: I think long overdue, the city actually having a mentoring program where you can work with Rotary, Kiwanis, private business, city hall employees, city employees, just regular volunteers, people that are willing to spend some time and be a mentor.

234
00:19:40,155 --> 00:19:42,396
[SPEAKER_11]: As we all know, there's a lot of broken families in our community.

235
00:19:43,104 --> 00:19:45,725
[SPEAKER_11]: People coming from single parent families, kids.

236
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:50,887
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we can start with kids that are about seven, eight years old and mentor them right through.

237
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:54,388
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Boston has a program that Mayor Walsh just initiated.

238
00:19:54,908 --> 00:20:00,290
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe he's looking for 1,000 mentors with a big handful of them being Boston City employees.

239
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:06,932
[SPEAKER_11]: But if we can do it on a smaller scale in Medford, maybe start with 50 people, I think that that's a goal.

240
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,193
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's up to the mayor to put this in place.

241
00:20:09,846 --> 00:20:15,769
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't see any reason why we can't with the size of our city and the committed people we have throughout this community.

242
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:20,030
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor made phone calls asking people for donations just last week.

243
00:20:20,571 --> 00:20:26,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe he can pick up the phone and call the same people and see if they're interested in getting a mentoring program off the ground.

244
00:20:26,613 --> 00:20:31,315
[SPEAKER_11]: And I, as one member of the city council, and I'm sure all of us are, would be more than willing to help him any way we can.

245
00:20:32,156 --> 00:20:32,336
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

246
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:33,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, council.

247
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:34,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Council Penta.

248
00:20:36,457 --> 00:20:36,838
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm this one.

249
00:20:37,358 --> 00:20:37,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Were you?

250
00:20:37,993 --> 00:20:38,713
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I didn't hit my button.

251
00:20:38,993 --> 00:20:40,473
[SPEAKER_10]: My apologies, Counselor Carfiello.

252
00:20:40,713 --> 00:20:41,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

253
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:49,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, as many of you know, I belong to the Mecca Kiwanis, and we have a program for the kids that starts out with the Builder's Club, the circle game.

254
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:55,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Counselor Moxley's son has been involved with this in the past, and we start out right in the elementary schools with these kids.

255
00:20:56,336 --> 00:21:01,757
[SPEAKER_04]: And they learn responsibility, they elect their own little board and president, they have their own membership.

256
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:06,618
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have one, and just recently, we have developed

257
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:14,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Circle K Club with Northeastern University has joined our club in Medford to help mentor the Medford children.

258
00:21:15,377 --> 00:21:20,159
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a program at the high school, at the Andrews, at the McGlynn, and at St.

259
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:20,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Joseph's.

260
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:24,621
[SPEAKER_04]: The only school we don't have a program in at the age is St.

261
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:25,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Raphael's.

262
00:21:25,902 --> 00:21:29,243
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, anybody wants to get interested in our Builders Club,

263
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:32,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Kwan and Scott, please let me know.

264
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:39,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be happy to have anyone be my guest on Monday night, and you can be involved and talk about it and see how the kids do get involved.

265
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:40,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Counselor.

266
00:21:40,813 --> 00:21:42,595
[SPEAKER_10]: The Kwan and Scott always get it done.

267
00:21:42,615 --> 00:21:43,135
[SPEAKER_10]: That's correct.

268
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:43,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Counselor Knight.

269
00:21:44,557 --> 00:21:45,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

270
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,741
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a good resolution.

271
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:49,643
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm reading it, and I think that it could work.

272
00:21:49,959 --> 00:22:08,102
[SPEAKER_07]: both ways I think inversely we could pair adults with youngsters who are willing to give back to the community to assist those maybe that are widowed at home that have problems maybe with some home repair, shoveling, mowing the lawn, that type of stuff, or other activities of daily living, Mr. President, whether it's helping pay the bills, that type of thing.

273
00:22:08,142 --> 00:22:16,764
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have a concern that if in fact the city does institute a program that it might take away from some of the non-profit organizations in the community that are already doing this kind of work, Mr. President.

274
00:22:17,484 --> 00:22:22,144
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd ask that you know if in fact the mayor was going to put together a mentoring program that he'd draw the people in

275
00:22:22,892 --> 00:22:36,218
[SPEAKER_07]: to his office right now for some advice, for some direction, for some deliberation as to what works, what doesn't work, and what we can do to pool our efforts together to ensure that the program would touch as many lives as it possibly can.

276
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:51,385
[SPEAKER_07]: If the Kiwanis have their Builders Club and it's, you know, working to make a mentoring program, pairing individuals, children with adults to mentor, we don't want to break that bond and we don't want to set back the good work that that club has done.

277
00:22:51,775 --> 00:23:02,756
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd ask that if the administration were in fact going to take this suggestion seriously, that they brought all the stakeholders to the table, Mr. President, to talk about best practices and to figure out ways that we're not pulling away from each other.

278
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:13,644
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all too often we see in the community, for example, if youth baseball and youth softball are having a fundraiser, they're going and they're asking the same people for the same stuff.

279
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,965
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're actually competing against each other to accomplish the same goal.

280
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:24,348
[SPEAKER_08]: So my only concern would be that the work that we do here as a city isn't detrimental to that, that other organizations have already done in the past.

281
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:26,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Counselor.

282
00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:27,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

283
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Vice President.

284
00:23:29,397 --> 00:23:30,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

285
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a great idea.

286
00:23:31,838 --> 00:23:34,299
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminds me of big brother, big sister.

287
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,600
[SPEAKER_01]: I took part in that for a few years before I had children.

288
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:42,582
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes a long way for the kids, and there are many kids in our community that do need it.

289
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:44,762
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thank Councilor Camuso for bringing this up.

290
00:23:45,643 --> 00:23:51,845
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to see how Boston is planning to lay this out and

291
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,008
[SPEAKER_01]: and try to implement it in Medford.

292
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:56,370
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree with the rest of my colleagues.

293
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:03,036
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot to it, I'm sure, to liability and a number of other things that would go with a mentoring program.

294
00:24:03,397 --> 00:24:04,858
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's something that would go a long way.

295
00:24:05,118 --> 00:24:17,210
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd ask the mayor whether we ask him to implement it or to look into what Boston's doing or to look into supplementing or helping out what the Qantas does, whether that's financial or

296
00:24:20,285 --> 00:24:27,749
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have so many organizations in the city that could all come together in one unilateral thing, Mr. President.

297
00:24:28,189 --> 00:24:29,830
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure we'd all be happy.

298
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:35,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if the mayor can work together, I mean, with the chamber, Kiwanis, Rotary, and we could all do something.

299
00:24:35,913 --> 00:24:38,655
[SPEAKER_01]: The more children we can help, the better.

300
00:24:38,795 --> 00:24:44,458
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have children in the public schools, and there are a lot of kids who need a mentor, so I think this is a great idea.

301
00:24:45,068 --> 00:25:02,734
[SPEAKER_01]: with mentors, it's just one thing, one other person in their lives from coaches to parents to teachers that help kids stay on the right path, stay away from drugs, stay into sports and art and music and do the right thing school-wise and when they're out of school.

302
00:25:03,014 --> 00:25:04,134
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's a great idea.

303
00:25:05,995 --> 00:25:07,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

304
00:25:07,135 --> 00:25:07,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

305
00:25:08,676 --> 00:25:10,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

306
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:14,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as everyone was talking, you know, it's great that I think we want the mayor to

307
00:25:15,402 --> 00:25:17,442
[SPEAKER_03]: implement something, and that's great.

308
00:25:18,023 --> 00:25:21,643
[SPEAKER_03]: But we as a council could implement our own program.

309
00:25:22,663 --> 00:25:31,925
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it would be a great idea to have youngsters of this community take part in local government by inviting them up to the meetings.

310
00:25:32,445 --> 00:25:39,447
[SPEAKER_03]: You can mentor your own student, invite them behind the reeling, let them listen to debate, let them add dialogue.

311
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:44,668
[SPEAKER_03]: And this could be a great way of involving kids throughout the community.

312
00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:47,136
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's something that we have direct control over.

313
00:25:47,876 --> 00:25:50,237
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't have to be limited to youngsters.

314
00:25:50,577 --> 00:25:53,238
[SPEAKER_03]: We can invite business owners behind the railing to sit down.

315
00:25:53,778 --> 00:25:55,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Every councilor can invite someone.

316
00:25:55,258 --> 00:25:59,440
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's a great way of opening up government, Mr. President.

317
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,862
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're right, the school committee, back some years ago, we used to invite people behind the railing.

318
00:26:06,262 --> 00:26:08,803
[SPEAKER_03]: And you would be a sponsor for someone.

319
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:31,952
[SPEAKER_03]: and that person would be able to ask questions of the chair, other members, and it was a real informative way of involving the community, getting input, and as we always hear, even from Jean who speaks at the podium and other people that come before the podium, that you look out in the audience and you might see at any given time four or five people in a city of 58,000 people.

320
00:26:32,552 --> 00:26:33,252
[SPEAKER_03]: What better way?

321
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:36,674
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would ask that as a council,

322
00:26:37,488 --> 00:26:48,852
[SPEAKER_03]: And in particular, you, Mr. President, that we allow maybe one meeting a month to be a sponsor, invite people behind the railing, one person per council.

323
00:26:48,872 --> 00:26:54,634
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to invite someone if you don't like and open the meeting up to allow someone else.

324
00:26:55,054 --> 00:27:01,236
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realize they're not elected and their vote is not going to carry weight as a vote on the council.

325
00:27:01,677 --> 00:27:05,618
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it would be a great experience for many youngsters in our community.

326
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:11,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And open that up, like I said, to business owners, to seniors, whoever we want to invite, Mr. President.

327
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,118
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's a win-win situation.

328
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:21,624
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I would look to your leadership, Mr. President, in putting something to that forward.

329
00:27:21,944 --> 00:27:27,329
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's something we can do and not rely on the mayor to act upon, because the mayor may never get around.

330
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:33,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I think this is a worthy program, Councilor Camuso, he may never get around to offering a mentoring program in the community.

331
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

332
00:27:38,273 --> 00:27:43,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Worthy recommendation.

333
00:27:44,117 --> 00:27:44,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Camuso?

334
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:45,939
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not for now.

335
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight?

336
00:27:48,921 --> 00:27:51,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, tomorrow there will be a Rules Committee meeting.

337
00:27:52,904 --> 00:28:00,090
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't want to be so bold as to suggest that Councilor Marks may be willing to put a B paper forward and refer that to the Rules Committee.

338
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,512
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can get the ball rolling on the mentoring program right now.

339
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:04,274
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're meeting tomorrow at 4.30.

340
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:07,710
[SPEAKER_07]: So moved.

341
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:11,772
I don't think we need to change our rules.

342
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:13,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, I mean, we can set up the parameters.

343
00:28:13,173 --> 00:28:19,475
[SPEAKER_07]: We can set up the parameters of the program in the rules committee, report it out to the committee of the whole for a vote, and then we can, we can start it up before this legislative session is over.

344
00:28:21,636 --> 00:28:21,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

345
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:27,579
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of, uh, Councilor, uh, Camuso amended by Councilor Marks.

346
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:28,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

347
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,800
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

348
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,141
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

349
00:28:31,161 --> 00:28:32,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

350
00:28:32,721 --> 00:28:35,022
[SPEAKER_10]: 15-098 offered by Councilor Penta.

351
00:28:37,018 --> 00:28:44,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that an update on last week's proposed, nope, 15-097 offered by Councilor Penta.

352
00:28:44,862 --> 00:28:48,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Comcast contract be discussed.

353
00:28:49,344 --> 00:28:50,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Penta.

354
00:28:50,285 --> 00:29:01,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President and council colleagues, but more importantly, our subscribers within our community, we're dealing with the end of a 10 year contract that Comcast has had here with the city of Medford.

355
00:29:02,091 --> 00:29:05,633
[SPEAKER_05]: And as everyone knows for the past few months, if not for the past,

356
00:29:06,003 --> 00:29:19,947
[SPEAKER_05]: a couple of years in particular, this Medford City Council has been actively requesting more information, not only on Comcast, but also as it relates to our public access channels here in the city of Medford as to what's been going on.

357
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:31,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Most recently, and it's kind of like disturbing, there have been accounts coming out of the courthouses and all across the Commonwealth, but as it relates to public access channels.

358
00:29:32,451 --> 00:29:34,112
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, there was a judge

359
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:37,354
[SPEAKER_05]: regarding the Saugus Community Cable Television.

360
00:29:37,455 --> 00:29:52,903
[SPEAKER_05]: It was now put a stop order against the Saugus Community Cable Television because of their refusal to allow the local board of selectmen to discuss certain aspects of public access and telecasting over there.

361
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:59,567
[SPEAKER_05]: The Attorney General's Office, just this past week, is now suing the Lynn Community Access Channel.

362
00:30:00,307 --> 00:30:03,689
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're alleging that these defendants abused their positions of power

363
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:09,843
[SPEAKER_05]: and were responsible for the misappropriation of charitable funds from this non-profit, said Attorney General Healy.

364
00:30:10,523 --> 00:30:16,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Actions such as the ones alleged here cause financial harm to the charity and its mission and undermine the public's trust.

365
00:30:17,267 --> 00:30:24,332
[SPEAKER_05]: We hope that through this action we can recover the money rightfully owed back to the charity, which is the non-profit, which happens to be the public access.

366
00:30:24,852 --> 00:30:33,878
[SPEAKER_05]: We have here in the city of Medford, dating back to, I believe, July of last year, a multiple request of the Medford's TV3 public access channel

367
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:39,149
[SPEAKER_05]: who supposedly filed a resolution of dissolution just past September.

368
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:51,219
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was our city solicitor who, at that point in time, sent us a huge packet of information demanding certain documents to be coming forward from the people who were managing the public access channel.

369
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,102
[SPEAKER_05]: And he gave them a time deadline for which they did not respond.

370
00:30:55,662 --> 00:31:01,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe also, too, our city solicitor indicated that, I think it was either July or August of this past year,

371
00:31:01,953 --> 00:31:07,657
[SPEAKER_05]: that, in fact, that if they did not respond, that he would pursue other legal avenues.

372
00:31:08,058 --> 00:31:09,619
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what those avenues have been.

373
00:31:09,699 --> 00:31:12,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if any of those avenues have taken place.

374
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:17,324
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are now here in March of this year.

375
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:31,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just received on my desk here right now tonight, I think we all did, a letter dated December 18, 2014, delivered to the Honorable Michael J. McGlynn from Thomas Kelly, director from Xfinity.

376
00:31:32,555 --> 00:31:35,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Last paragraph, sentence in the last paragraph, please.

377
00:31:35,897 --> 00:31:46,623
[SPEAKER_05]: We believe this renewal proposal substantially meets the community cable related needs while taking into account the cost to individual subscribers in accordance with section 626 B and C of the cable.

378
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:56,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Best part, the city has an obligation under the formal renewal process to either accept or deny Comcast proposal within four months or no later than April 18th.

379
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,612
[SPEAKER_05]: We, this has been in city hall since December 18th.

380
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:07,144
[SPEAKER_05]: This is now March 17th, with less than a month and a day to go.

381
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:10,727
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're just finding this out now.

382
00:32:11,427 --> 00:32:24,678
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor, I believe, has a responsibility, as he did some 10 years ago, to have a public hearing allowing ratepayers, citizens, anybody who are proponents or opponents to the renewal of the contract.

383
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:31,103
[SPEAKER_05]: We have asked, I believe intimately, over the past few months, when is this contract renewal

384
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,021
[SPEAKER_05]: public hearing going to take place.

385
00:32:33,861 --> 00:32:35,441
[SPEAKER_05]: We received no responses on it.

386
00:32:35,461 --> 00:32:54,388
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go to page 26, and this is just a quick perusal to this thing, on the top it says, in the event that the issuing authority or other PEG access user elects not to fully program its channels with original PEG access programming, the licensee may reclaim any unused time on those channels.

387
00:32:55,394 --> 00:33:17,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I don't know where we're going with all of that, but that tells me that if the mayor of this community refuses or so chooses not to engage public access anymore in this community, that in fact, Comcast can take over that Channel 3 and do whatever it wants, and the city would not be able to get monies that they have in the past on public access.

388
00:33:18,462 --> 00:33:21,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking at this real quick, I could be wrong, but I think that's the way it reads.

389
00:33:22,104 --> 00:33:27,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, and more importantly, why would we even want to engage in another 10-year contract?

390
00:33:27,446 --> 00:33:29,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Look what's happened with our rubbish contract.

391
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:31,208
[SPEAKER_05]: We're engaged with them for 10 years.

392
00:33:31,568 --> 00:33:37,932
[SPEAKER_05]: We just got embroiled with a ridiculous 10-year kiosk program here in the city, you know, a meter program.

393
00:33:37,992 --> 00:33:40,453
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we're looking at a renewal to a

394
00:33:41,213 --> 00:33:44,875
[SPEAKER_05]: public acts strike that to a cable contract for 10 years.

395
00:33:45,175 --> 00:33:48,076
[SPEAKER_05]: But the difference on this cable contract from the last one is this.

396
00:33:48,496 --> 00:33:59,000
[SPEAKER_05]: The technology has become so advanced out there right now that we really don't know within the next 10 years if new technology can supersede that for which Comcast is giving to us.

397
00:34:00,401 --> 00:34:05,723
[SPEAKER_05]: My advice would be, and since the mayor is obviously not having his public hearing, I have no idea why.

398
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:08,624
[SPEAKER_05]: He has got one month and one day to pull this off, which is a

399
00:34:09,303 --> 00:34:12,466
[SPEAKER_05]: period of time to get intelligent people down here to talk about this.

400
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:24,937
[SPEAKER_05]: But rather than go forward with a 10-year contract, I would probably make a recommendation that we have a three-year contract, with a two-year contract possible for renewal, at that point in time, just to see where we're going with all of this.

401
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:37,888
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes no sense to say, yes, we're going forward for 10 years, when you're not having a public meeting and a public forum, for which I believe—I'm not—don't hold me to it, but I believe that that was part of the licensing.

402
00:34:38,217 --> 00:34:39,637
[SPEAKER_05]: and the relicensing process.

403
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:45,578
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, unfortunately, just getting this tonight and trying to peruse it, I mean, that's one part of it.

404
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:54,760
[SPEAKER_05]: The other part of it is we haven't still gotten any accounting of monies allegedly not found or misappropriated or what have you.

405
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:03,381
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't gotten a full accounting of the inventory that was down there, if it's been sold, if it's been used or what have you.

406
00:35:04,261 --> 00:35:07,342
[SPEAKER_05]: And here we are engaging ourselves, if this be the case,

407
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:16,542
[SPEAKER_05]: with a potential 10-year contract, and then looking at surrounding cities and towns where not only the attorney general has stepped in, but you also have it with Lynn.

408
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:17,582
[SPEAKER_05]: You have it in Saugus.

409
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:18,983
[SPEAKER_05]: You have it in Bolton.

410
00:35:19,363 --> 00:35:25,385
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have it in Rehoboth, where the guy got eight years, eight years in jail for misappropriating funds.

411
00:35:26,066 --> 00:35:28,467
[SPEAKER_05]: You have problems with Wincambe and Winchester.

412
00:35:29,598 --> 00:35:31,161
[SPEAKER_05]: These are things that are just surrounding us.

413
00:35:31,241 --> 00:35:33,845
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're living right in the middle of all of this right now.

414
00:35:34,306 --> 00:35:38,152
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can't get answers to satisfy what we have, never mind going forward.

415
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:40,716
[SPEAKER_05]: So I look at this as a three-pronged approach.

416
00:35:40,776 --> 00:35:41,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one.

417
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,921
[SPEAKER_05]: We have no public hearing for which I think we should have.

418
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:48,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, we still don't even have anything resolved as TV3 and the city of Medford.

419
00:35:49,762 --> 00:36:00,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Accountability not only from inventory, accountability from records and for tax filings, for bank accounts and who's on them and who's allowed to them.

420
00:36:01,505 --> 00:36:09,287
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, getting involved with a 10-year contract that's right around the corner, I don't think it would serve the rate payers of this community well.

421
00:36:09,387 --> 00:36:10,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would serve them a lot better

422
00:36:11,144 --> 00:36:16,468
[SPEAKER_05]: if they had an opportunity to maybe have a three-year contract with a two-year renewal, if that be the case, to see where we're going.

423
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:22,573
[SPEAKER_05]: The state and the art of technology is so advanced today that who knows where we're going to be able to be at that point in time.

424
00:36:22,653 --> 00:36:34,503
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we get locked into something that we can't get out of, it might cost subscribers more money in the years 7, 8, 9, and 10, or 6, or whatever it might be, than what they could possibly get with a more advanced contract.

425
00:36:35,424 --> 00:36:39,327
[SPEAKER_05]: It shocks me how this city just runs itself with these 10-year contracts.

426
00:36:39,828 --> 00:36:50,033
[SPEAKER_05]: And nobody is looking for a 10-year contract other than Comcast and the mayor of this community who is allowing this to go forward without even having a public hearing to have any kind of a discussion on it.

427
00:36:51,074 --> 00:36:55,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Some two weeks, I think it was two weeks ago this past Monday, going two and a half weeks ago, I spoke with the attorney.

428
00:36:56,056 --> 00:37:04,801
[SPEAKER_05]: He was representing the city of Medford on their public access information and legalese stuff, whatever it was.

429
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:06,962
[SPEAKER_05]: He told me as of two, two and a half weeks ago,

430
00:37:07,315 --> 00:37:11,936
[SPEAKER_05]: He has had absolutely no contact with the City of Medford on its renewal with Comcast.

431
00:37:12,337 --> 00:37:14,057
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know where we're going with this.

432
00:37:14,157 --> 00:37:16,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think anyone behind this reel knows where we're going with this.

433
00:37:16,918 --> 00:37:25,821
[SPEAKER_05]: But I really think that we need to send a message to the mayor and behalf of the subscribers that something needs to stop on the tracks and we don't need another 10-year contract.

434
00:37:26,001 --> 00:37:30,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to have a real look and see, a public hearing, and have some open and public discussion.

435
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:38,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caviello.

436
00:37:38,128 --> 00:37:38,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

437
00:37:39,248 --> 00:37:50,513
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm going on my fourth year on this council here, and out of the four years here, only a couple of months, my first term, there was a little bit of a TV station, and that was it.

438
00:37:51,173 --> 00:37:52,154
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was gone after that.

439
00:37:53,074 --> 00:37:57,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we had a vote for anything for 10 years on another contract, is that correct?

440
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:00,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought 10 years had to be voted on by us.

441
00:38:01,658 --> 00:38:05,060
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, right, am I correct, anything over three years is supposed to be voted on by us, or five years?

442
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Three years, okay, well, 10.

443
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:11,722
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing is, why are we voting for three years?

444
00:38:13,002 --> 00:38:16,463
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't done anything for the last three years and we're gonna vote for another three years to sit around and do nothing?

445
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:23,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, from what I understand is they haven't had any suitors that are looking to take over the station here.

446
00:38:25,646 --> 00:38:31,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, all these little things here, there's nothing happening here.

447
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,628
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't understand why, at $350,000,

448
00:38:35,051 --> 00:38:38,534
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't hire somebody—I mean, why can't we go out and hire a private company?

449
00:38:38,554 --> 00:38:40,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind a volunteer company.

450
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:46,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there has to be a company you can hire that'll go out there and run a station privately.

451
00:38:48,342 --> 00:38:50,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there's companies out there that do this.

452
00:38:50,383 --> 00:38:52,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it doesn't have to be a volunteer thing.

453
00:38:52,265 --> 00:38:54,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, volunteers could come in and do the thing.

454
00:38:54,366 --> 00:39:00,191
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as running an actual station, there must be companies that do this as an actual business.

455
00:39:06,896 --> 00:39:09,498
[SPEAKER_05]: In the second paragraph, it says that the city is getting $350,000.

456
00:39:09,738 --> 00:39:13,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the prior contract, the city got $450,000.

457
00:39:13,741 --> 00:39:14,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Rick?

458
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:14,001
$425,000.

459
00:39:14,522 --> 00:39:20,406
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going down $75,000 on what they're going to give us.

460
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:24,549
[SPEAKER_05]: They're looking for another 10-year contract, and we don't even know what the hell we're getting.

461
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:30,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you vote for 3 years, we're going to vote for 3 years of continuing to do nothing?

462
00:39:31,474 --> 00:39:34,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what happens after April 18th?

463
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:36,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we done?

464
00:39:36,527 --> 00:39:40,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the contract done and it never comes back again if it doesn't get signed?

465
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:44,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need answers before we can vote on anything again.

466
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:52,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Pender's right, 10 more years is ridiculous until we have some type of answers to know where we're going with this thing.

467
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:56,820
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, from what I understand, there's no one out there that's looking to take this over.

468
00:39:57,741 --> 00:40:04,986
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say, I don't understand why we can't go out there and solicit or find someone that wants to run a TV station for a profit.

469
00:40:06,398 --> 00:40:09,420
[SPEAKER_04]: and let the volunteers come in and do their volunteer work after.

470
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:15,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I'd like to have an answer whether we have to vote on a 10-year acceptance.

471
00:40:15,224 --> 00:40:19,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if we had to vote on the meters, why don't we have to vote for it for this?

472
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:22,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Trash contract, everything else.

473
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:35,619
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of Councilor Caviello that the city solicitor report back to the city council rather whether or not we need to

474
00:40:36,189 --> 00:40:41,212
[SPEAKER_10]: ratify or approve the 10-year contract with our friends at Xfinity.

475
00:40:41,592 --> 00:40:51,537
[SPEAKER_04]: And for an update on where we are, then that would go to the the purchasing agent where we are with the process

476
00:41:02,885 --> 00:41:07,348
[SPEAKER_10]: for asking someone to be involved with the process of community cable vision.

477
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of clarification, Councillor Penter.

478
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:17,413
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

479
00:41:18,054 --> 00:41:18,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I got you?

480
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:43,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Rick, I think the question that you're really wanting to ask, by what law are we required to sign to approve a 10-year contract?

481
00:41:43,963 --> 00:41:48,965
[SPEAKER_05]: That, I think, needs to be the question rather than— Let me say, because what happens after April 18th?

482
00:41:49,265 --> 00:41:52,706
[SPEAKER_04]: If the contract's not signed, does the contract go away and never comes back again?

483
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:57,368
[SPEAKER_04]: They say, I hate to spend 10 more years of doing nothing and just taking the people's money.

484
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:01,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councillors.

485
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Councillor Camuso.

486
00:42:03,871 --> 00:42:08,394
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just, as we're looking at this, I think we have to be very realistic.

487
00:42:09,015 --> 00:42:19,161
[SPEAKER_11]: We heard it loud and clear over the past five years, people wanted Verizon, people wanted the opportunity to go out and choose which cable provider that they would like to subscribe to.

488
00:42:19,781 --> 00:42:28,147
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, I actually support the renewal of the contract, just based upon giving people the opportunity to make a

489
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:30,578
[SPEAKER_11]: on what provider they would like.

490
00:42:31,018 --> 00:42:41,260
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see any reason why, though, they can't open this up at this point to other vendors that may be interested and not just exclusively Verizon and Comcast or Xfinity.

491
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:46,601
[SPEAKER_11]: But like I said, this is something this city council called for for years.

492
00:42:47,121 --> 00:42:49,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Competition, competition, competition.

493
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:54,982
[SPEAKER_11]: And if this doesn't get renewed, I would think that competition is now by the wayside in the city of Medford.

494
00:42:57,003 --> 00:42:57,823
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know that to be 100% true,

495
00:42:58,902 --> 00:43:02,804
[SPEAKER_11]: It sort of makes sense just based upon the contract not being renewed.

496
00:43:02,824 --> 00:43:09,408
[SPEAKER_11]: At some point, Comcast would no longer be available to be subscribed to.

497
00:43:09,768 --> 00:43:14,811
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I just think we've got to think about that because we were very adamant.

498
00:43:14,891 --> 00:43:16,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Councillor Marks, do you remember how many years it was?

499
00:43:16,932 --> 00:43:20,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Councillor Carr was on the Council when we were trying to get Verizon in here.

500
00:43:21,074 --> 00:43:21,934
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been that long ago.

501
00:43:23,315 --> 00:43:26,457
[SPEAKER_11]: So, competition is good for the consumer.

502
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

503
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:34,682
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to amend the paper with the B paper, Mr. President.

504
00:43:34,802 --> 00:43:43,946
[SPEAKER_07]: And the B paper would read that the Mayor and the City Council President work together to appoint a member of the City Council to be a member of the negotiating team in the upcoming contract renewals.

505
00:43:48,988 --> 00:43:49,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councillor.

506
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:52,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Vice President.

507
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

508
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:58,012
[SPEAKER_01]: I, too, agree that the contract needs to be renewed,

509
00:43:59,155 --> 00:44:09,602
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what we all probably have an issue with, or, you know, especially those who spoke very adamantly against what TV3 was doing in this community, is certain portions of the contract.

510
00:44:10,423 --> 00:44:21,271
[SPEAKER_01]: We still don't have answers with regards to a new TV3 station, and I know it's already been said, we don't have answers to the filings that were supposed to be done with the Secretary of State from the board.

511
00:44:22,312 --> 00:44:26,955
[SPEAKER_01]: We have issue with how things were run at TV3, you know, Lynn Saugus,

512
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:49,875
[SPEAKER_01]: other communities are getting investigated, possibly prosecuted, certain people within the TV arena, yet a judge came into Medford, listened to two days' worth of testimony, declared that TV3, the board, should be reported to the attorney general's office, yet nothing ever happened.

513
00:44:50,475 --> 00:44:54,238
[SPEAKER_01]: So we seem to never get anywhere with regards to what

514
00:44:55,923 --> 00:45:00,026
[SPEAKER_01]: should have taken place, why it didn't take place, and why it's still not taking place.

515
00:45:00,146 --> 00:45:05,430
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we get the runaround, and nobody's doing what they needed to do at TV3.

516
00:45:07,432 --> 00:45:17,120
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this contract needs to be tweaked, and we need to get some answers before we agree to put any money into peg access.

517
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:24,125
[SPEAKER_01]: We're putting money into—we're taking ratepayers' money, a portion, which is 5 percent,

518
00:45:24,728 --> 00:45:29,130
[SPEAKER_01]: of the licensee's gross annual revenues and put it towards PEG access.

519
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what are we getting for our money?

520
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:36,912
[SPEAKER_01]: We have money that is being tied up for a TV station in this city that is not being used.

521
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:46,236
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, whether we put somebody from the council to help the mayor negotiate or we discuss it further on the floor, we need some answers.

522
00:45:47,316 --> 00:45:49,197
[SPEAKER_01]: When are we going to implement a TV station?

523
00:45:50,193 --> 00:45:56,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we have any answers with regards to what the board of directors were supposed to file with the Secretary of State's office?

524
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:59,857
[SPEAKER_01]: It was supposed to be done months ago, from what I understand.

525
00:45:59,937 --> 00:46:03,558
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, July?

526
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:03,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

527
00:46:04,779 --> 00:46:05,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Months and months ago.

528
00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:07,160
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's unfortunate.

529
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:19,345
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but hopefully this council speaking out, just like we spoke out about competition between providers, just like we spoke out about the elimination of TV3 and what was going on down there.

530
00:46:19,732 --> 00:46:30,596
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to keep speaking out, and hopefully we'll be able to get somewhere, get a new TV3 access station, run smoothly and professionally, as well as negotiate this contract.

531
00:46:30,656 --> 00:46:31,496
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor has a month.

532
00:46:31,536 --> 00:46:32,757
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first I've heard of it.

533
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:48,943
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a month to let the mayor know what we want to see, what information we need, and hopefully, especially if the administration needs our approval, hopefully some things are renegotiated so it's in the best interest of the taxpayer.

534
00:46:49,691 --> 00:46:50,452
[SPEAKER_01]: and the ratepayer.

535
00:46:54,334 --> 00:47:08,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I'd also like Director Burke, if I can make a motion, to provide us with the last four consecutive fiscal years of franchise fees that came into this community as a result of a 1987 vote or 88 vote of the Medford City Council.

536
00:47:08,945 --> 00:47:11,207
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing that says we have to keep that in place.

537
00:47:12,748 --> 00:47:14,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Members of this Medford City Council

538
00:47:14,821 --> 00:47:17,704
[SPEAKER_11]: if we wanted to can do away with the franchise fee on the monthly bill.

539
00:47:18,104 --> 00:47:27,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we have to be obvious, we obviously have to be aware that there are many good programs that are funded through it, teachers in the school system and things of that nature.

540
00:47:27,935 --> 00:47:36,844
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'd like to see four years worth of franchise fees and then we can take a serious look at if it's something that we want to continue as a practice here in the city of Medford.

541
00:47:54,628 --> 00:48:12,317
[SPEAKER_01]: just on that Councilor Camuso's four years of franchise fees, if we could just also get a breakdown of what has been spent out of that account for the last four years, and then we'll know better what is being funded so that if we want to reduce it from 350 to 200 just to

542
00:48:13,627 --> 00:48:17,030
[SPEAKER_01]: fund what we're doing now, then we know what the accurate amount should be.

543
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:19,312
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this is this is playing into the whole picture.

544
00:48:19,352 --> 00:48:20,793
[SPEAKER_11]: We asked for the transfers last week.

545
00:48:21,213 --> 00:48:28,299
[SPEAKER_11]: We're actually holding in on the budget now to see where there could be some savings, where in the past we haven't asked for some of this empirical data.

546
00:48:29,299 --> 00:48:30,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilman.

547
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:30,500
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

548
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:31,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

549
00:48:31,921 --> 00:48:33,242
[SPEAKER_10]: The floor goes to Councilman Marks.

550
00:48:34,063 --> 00:48:35,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

551
00:48:35,184 --> 00:48:38,887
[SPEAKER_03]: And this dialogue is extremely helpful.

552
00:48:39,547 --> 00:48:54,696
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I would say is with the last contract that the mayor signed with Comcast, that contract called for yearly increases to every ratepayer of this community with no relief in sight.

553
00:48:55,857 --> 00:49:01,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't spoken to one person in this community that said that their cable rates are going down.

554
00:49:02,561 --> 00:49:07,244
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's been steady increases in cable rates over the last ten years.

555
00:49:09,352 --> 00:49:12,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you want to give out another 10-year contract?

556
00:49:12,553 --> 00:49:25,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't it be more prudent to have both Verizon and Comcast on a short leash, having them worry about whether or not the city's going to renew the contract?

557
00:49:25,659 --> 00:49:38,245
[SPEAKER_03]: And that way, in my opinion, they'll be more competitive with the rates, and they'll be more willing not to raise rates because they know the contract's going to be up in two or three years.

558
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:42,981
[SPEAKER_03]: This 10-year contract does nothing for the ratepayers of this community.

559
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:55,003
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be easy for the mayor to sign a 10-year contract and take that off his plate so he doesn't have to revisit that for another 10 years, but it does nothing for you or I as a ratepayer, Mr. President.

560
00:49:55,363 --> 00:49:56,763
[SPEAKER_03]: It does nothing to lower rates.

561
00:49:57,203 --> 00:50:05,705
[SPEAKER_03]: It does nothing to improve programming, as we've seen with local access for the last three and a half years in this community, and in my opinion,

562
00:50:07,884 --> 00:50:14,672
[SPEAKER_03]: It would suit every ratepayer in this community if they were part of the negotiations.

563
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:21,159
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realize the mayor is the sole negotiating authority, but why not put together, as Councillor Knight mentioned,

564
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:37,491
[SPEAKER_03]: member of the council, maybe a member of the business community, you know, a senior member of the community, someone, you know, a family member, someone that has a family in the community, a host of different people in the community to sit on this committee and negotiate it, Mr. President.

565
00:50:38,512 --> 00:50:45,617
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it just, to me, you know, it's the quick fix to getting a contract out of the way.

566
00:50:46,398 --> 00:50:49,380
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I mentioned, rates have not gone down.

567
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,201
[SPEAKER_03]: So my past experience in this community,

568
00:50:51,654 --> 00:50:54,296
[SPEAKER_03]: is that rates go up every year, unchecked.

569
00:50:55,297 --> 00:51:00,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thought is, well, if you don't want to go with us, go with Verizon.

570
00:51:01,801 --> 00:51:05,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And you go to Verizon, their rates are no better than Comcast, to be quite honest with you.

571
00:51:06,045 --> 00:51:07,265
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in cahoots with each other.

572
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:10,648
[SPEAKER_03]: So the service may differ a little bit.

573
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:20,415
[SPEAKER_03]: But when it truly comes to the leverage we have as a community, it's bargaining the contract and standing up for the residents of this community

574
00:51:20,774 --> 00:51:28,340
[SPEAKER_03]: and stating right within the contract, for the first four years, we do not want a rate crease, no rate crease at all.

575
00:51:29,181 --> 00:51:33,864
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be part of a contract that I was signed, Mr. President, if I was in charge.

576
00:51:34,485 --> 00:51:38,828
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be on behalf of the beleaguered taxpayer and ratepayer in this community.

577
00:51:39,427 --> 00:51:45,792
[SPEAKER_03]: And to leave it open-ended and give a 10-year contract, you just might as well give them a blank check, because that's what's going to happen.

578
00:51:46,052 --> 00:51:48,974
[SPEAKER_03]: The minute that's signed, the rates are going to continue to go up.

579
00:51:49,354 --> 00:51:52,736
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden, the programming they were offering, that's how they squeeze you.

580
00:51:53,117 --> 00:52:01,963
[SPEAKER_03]: They give you a certain tier you're in, and all of a sudden, the four major channels that you used to watch in that tier are no longer part of that tier.

581
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:04,445
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to move up to the next tier, which is another $39.50 a month.

582
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And they squeeze you and continually squeeze you in that manner.

583
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:17,544
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I would hope that the mayor doesn't consider doing this alone, the contract negotiations.

584
00:52:18,024 --> 00:52:34,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would hope that he looks for a much shorter contract so we can keep this company on a short leash and hold them accountable, Mr. President, for raising rates and doing away with programming and not offering local cable access.

585
00:52:35,261 --> 00:52:37,382
[SPEAKER_03]: because they should be the ones, Mr. President.

586
00:52:37,803 --> 00:52:40,144
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the ones collecting our franchise fee.

587
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:54,711
[SPEAKER_03]: The local cable access should be going to the mayor and saying, Mr. Mayor, with all due respect, we're collecting money from every rate payer in the community saying that we're going to provide access, and we haven't done that for four years, Mr. President.

588
00:52:55,212 --> 00:53:03,116
[SPEAKER_03]: As a business owner, I feel incumbent to raise this to you, Mr. Mayor, and say maybe we should not be collecting these franchise fees.

589
00:53:03,492 --> 00:53:07,553
[SPEAKER_03]: until you get your house in order and provide local cable access.

590
00:53:08,533 --> 00:53:25,576
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are a lot of issues with this, and I look forward to, in particular, Councilor Knight's resolution to see if we could have a seat on this as part of this negotiation, and also to include other residents of this community, Mr. President.

591
00:53:26,016 --> 00:53:27,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

592
00:53:31,257 --> 00:53:33,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

593
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:33,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

594
00:53:34,296 --> 00:53:38,858
[SPEAKER_12]: Joseph Villione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Massachusetts.

595
00:53:38,918 --> 00:53:43,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much, City Council, for discussing this very, very important point.

596
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Caraviello brought up the suitors.

597
00:53:48,202 --> 00:53:56,305
[SPEAKER_12]: The problem there is that the mayor has these stringent rules for the next access station that he didn't enforce with the previous station.

598
00:53:56,965 --> 00:54:02,847
[SPEAKER_12]: So there is a major player that is seriously considering coming in here and making a pitch.

599
00:54:03,398 --> 00:54:05,200
[SPEAKER_12]: I heard Councilor Camuso say Winchester.

600
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:10,267
[SPEAKER_12]: The sad thing about Winchester is a lot of the great board members, really good people, fled.

601
00:54:10,888 --> 00:54:11,829
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been in discussion.

602
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:13,891
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a 30-minute conversation with Richard Howard.

603
00:54:13,911 --> 00:54:15,393
[SPEAKER_12]: He called me in, and I met with him.

604
00:54:16,034 --> 00:54:20,640
[SPEAKER_12]: And there were problems over there now because the good people, the people that were keeping it, public access, are gone.

605
00:54:21,197 --> 00:54:23,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Now they shut the doors to outside people.

606
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,681
[SPEAKER_12]: They had people from other communities.

607
00:54:26,381 --> 00:54:27,682
[SPEAKER_12]: They want to be Winchester only.

608
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:35,348
[SPEAKER_12]: For them to come to Medford would be ludicrous, because I have some inside information, and I know that they want to make it Winchester, Winchester, Winchester.

609
00:54:35,368 --> 00:54:38,591
[SPEAKER_12]: It would only benefit the old board of directors.

610
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:41,993
[SPEAKER_12]: And they've been on the board for 10 years, on two of them, and five years, one.

611
00:54:42,274 --> 00:54:43,234
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just like TV3.

612
00:54:43,775 --> 00:54:45,216
[SPEAKER_12]: So now that has changed.

613
00:54:45,476 --> 00:54:49,359
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, Councilor Penta has made a very good point about the new technology.

614
00:54:50,699 --> 00:54:55,243
[SPEAKER_12]: It might be apples and oranges, but I was talking to one of the major chains, retail chains for DVDs.

615
00:54:55,823 --> 00:55:00,807
[SPEAKER_12]: He said that sales have fallen off the cliff, Redbox and Netflix have taken over.

616
00:55:00,887 --> 00:55:03,910
[SPEAKER_12]: Now they saw it coming, but he said to me, we didn't see it coming this quick.

617
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:07,192
[SPEAKER_12]: And he just discarded 10,000 CDs and DVDs titles.

618
00:55:07,893 --> 00:55:10,855
[SPEAKER_12]: He said, guardians of the galaxy is not going to sell in our store.

619
00:55:11,436 --> 00:55:14,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Very important because the technology has changed now.

620
00:55:14,924 --> 00:55:20,046
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the local businessmen told me that he put that box you can buy, and you can get Hulu and Netflix.

621
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:25,749
[SPEAKER_12]: Instead of having cable, he got so upset with it all, his son installed the box, and now they're using that.

622
00:55:26,689 --> 00:55:29,350
[SPEAKER_12]: Go to Micro Center on Memorial Drive in Cambridge.

623
00:55:29,991 --> 00:55:32,192
[SPEAKER_12]: Google has a $2,000 TV.

624
00:55:33,232 --> 00:55:33,892
[SPEAKER_12]: It is huge.

625
00:55:34,633 --> 00:55:36,253
[SPEAKER_12]: It is for internet television.

626
00:55:36,314 --> 00:55:37,434
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the wave of the future.

627
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:44,097
[SPEAKER_12]: And I sat in on many WinCam board meetings, and one of the great board members that left

628
00:55:44,493 --> 00:55:47,994
[SPEAKER_12]: He kept saying, it's going to be five years, it might be three years, it's coming.

629
00:55:48,334 --> 00:55:50,075
[SPEAKER_12]: This new technology is a wave.

630
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:52,596
[SPEAKER_12]: It isn't, oh, four, five, seven years off.

631
00:55:52,676 --> 00:55:54,216
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's more like two years off.

632
00:55:54,696 --> 00:55:57,257
[SPEAKER_12]: So a 10-year deal is insanity.

633
00:55:57,317 --> 00:55:59,338
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, what do I know?

634
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:01,618
[SPEAKER_12]: I've only been doing this for close to 40 years.

635
00:56:02,419 --> 00:56:03,279
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been studying it.

636
00:56:04,019 --> 00:56:07,620
[SPEAKER_12]: I spent thousands of hours on this issue, as this city council well knows.

637
00:56:09,001 --> 00:56:12,662
[SPEAKER_12]: The mayor is making it very, very difficult for a suitor to come in.

638
00:56:13,262 --> 00:56:17,083
[SPEAKER_12]: be it Wincambe, be it the other suitor that I'm aware of, they very much want to come in here.

639
00:56:17,403 --> 00:56:19,644
[SPEAKER_12]: They're a great, great enterprise.

640
00:56:21,105 --> 00:56:27,547
[SPEAKER_12]: And Mayor McGlynn happens to have a lot of respect for them, so I hope that that suitor does come in because they would get my vote and I would fight for them.

641
00:56:29,087 --> 00:56:30,327
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, Winchester's gone.

642
00:56:30,528 --> 00:56:31,548
[SPEAKER_12]: The good board members are gone.

643
00:56:32,028 --> 00:56:37,170
[SPEAKER_12]: So the old cronies have taken over, much like Frank and the gang at our old station.

644
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:40,311
[SPEAKER_12]: It's now an old crony station over there and it's only for the

645
00:56:42,388 --> 00:56:43,888
[SPEAKER_12]: for the people on the board using it.

646
00:56:43,968 --> 00:56:48,809
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, Mayor McGlynn doesn't want anyone on the staff of the board making their own television shows.

647
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:56,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, that's pure access TV, sure, but every other station has people on the board and on the staff using it.

648
00:56:56,271 --> 00:57:02,192
[SPEAKER_12]: So, he's telling a new provider to come in and play by new rules that he didn't enforce for the old gang.

649
00:57:03,312 --> 00:57:06,653
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, Councilor Caravaggio had another good point, too, about

650
00:57:08,996 --> 00:57:11,698
[SPEAKER_12]: Access TV, and it just slipped my mind, but it was a great point.

651
00:57:12,779 --> 00:57:13,579
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll come back to me.

652
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:27,169
[SPEAKER_12]: And, Brianna, you brought up a really good point about something, and I think a Cable Advisory Commission is what we really need here, because every city and town has a Cable Advisory Commission.

653
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:28,890
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's Medford's?

654
00:57:29,691 --> 00:57:31,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, Bob Skerry is the last standing guy on it.

655
00:57:32,313 --> 00:57:35,615
[SPEAKER_12]: I put a public records request in to that Cable Advisory Commission.

656
00:57:36,651 --> 00:57:37,131
[SPEAKER_12]: No answer.

657
00:57:37,231 --> 00:57:41,914
[SPEAKER_12]: So I went to the Secretary of State's office and they called the guy up and said, are you going to answer this?

658
00:57:41,934 --> 00:57:42,835
[SPEAKER_12]: And he goes, I resign.

659
00:57:43,415 --> 00:57:48,719
[SPEAKER_12]: So he quit from the Cable Advisory Commission in Medford because I asked him if it's active.

660
00:57:48,759 --> 00:57:49,499
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you believe this?

661
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:55,203
[SPEAKER_12]: A deceased resident of Medford was on the Mayor's Cable Advisory Commission for five years.

662
00:57:56,645 --> 00:57:56,905
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay?

663
00:57:57,465 --> 00:58:08,730
[SPEAKER_12]: How disrespectful to that man's family that his name was used for five years on the city website, and I've got it documented in my emails, and I can pull up all the emails in the years that the mayor did this to this family.

664
00:58:09,271 --> 00:58:10,331
[SPEAKER_12]: Unbelievable.

665
00:58:10,831 --> 00:58:13,352
[SPEAKER_12]: So then there were two guys left, Bob Skerry and another fellow.

666
00:58:13,432 --> 00:58:14,353
[SPEAKER_12]: His name escapes me.

667
00:58:14,953 --> 00:58:18,635
[SPEAKER_12]: His brother writes for the Medford Mercury, the sports page, if anyone can remember the name there.

668
00:58:19,175 --> 00:58:22,056
[SPEAKER_12]: But Bob Skerry's a really nice guy.

669
00:58:22,536 --> 00:58:23,357
[SPEAKER_12]: He has a good heart.

670
00:58:23,857 --> 00:58:24,777
[SPEAKER_12]: He wants access.

671
00:58:24,797 --> 00:58:25,338
[SPEAKER_12]: He said, Joe,

672
00:58:26,217 --> 00:58:28,999
[SPEAKER_12]: The cable advisory committee is missing from the city webpage.

673
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:30,580
[SPEAKER_12]: He goes, I think it's gone.

674
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:34,663
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a member of the advisory committee telling me he thinks it's gone.

675
00:58:35,604 --> 00:58:36,164
[SPEAKER_12]: You do the math.

676
00:58:36,264 --> 00:58:40,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, you people probably weren't aware of this Xfinity letter I handed out today.

677
00:58:42,408 --> 00:58:48,413
[SPEAKER_12]: In November, I received a public records request response from the city solicitor who told me they had no correspondence from Comcast.

678
00:58:49,633 --> 00:58:51,415
[SPEAKER_12]: A ten-year deal and there's no correspondence?

679
00:58:51,435 --> 00:58:52,395
[SPEAKER_12]: So I put it in again.

680
00:58:52,836 --> 00:58:54,257
[SPEAKER_12]: Didn't get a response until today.

681
00:58:55,218 --> 00:58:58,721
[SPEAKER_12]: when he said, you can go to the mayor's office or the clerk's office, city solicitor.

682
00:58:58,741 --> 00:59:00,002
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much, city solicitor.

683
00:59:00,062 --> 00:59:01,664
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate the info.

684
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:09,811
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I went down at Finn's office this morning, and I found it, and I said, Clerk Finn, when did this come in?

685
00:59:09,871 --> 00:59:10,452
[SPEAKER_12]: He didn't know.

686
00:59:10,892 --> 00:59:19,300
[SPEAKER_12]: I do see that Comcast CC'd him on December 18th, but there was no timestamp, as Clerk Finn graciously told me, no timestamp on it.

687
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,211
[SPEAKER_12]: So now I put these requests in.

688
00:59:21,231 --> 00:59:22,672
[SPEAKER_12]: There's only four months.

689
00:59:23,413 --> 00:59:24,473
[SPEAKER_12]: City Council didn't know.

690
00:59:25,154 --> 00:59:30,417
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, the public didn't know because the public access proponent didn't know and couldn't get a straight answer out of the mayor.

691
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:34,180
[SPEAKER_12]: The mayor said at a Comcast public hearing he wants transparency.

692
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,261
[SPEAKER_12]: Your Honor, that's not transparency.

693
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:36,942
[SPEAKER_12]: That's ducking.

694
00:59:37,442 --> 00:59:42,787
[SPEAKER_12]: And when you say transparency, you're a good politician, because you're saying one thing out of one end of your mouth, but you're doing another.

695
00:59:43,548 --> 00:59:44,269
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're tired of it.

696
00:59:44,469 --> 00:59:47,332
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm tired of it, because I would rather be doing my productions.

697
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:57,882
[SPEAKER_12]: I would rather be doing my business work, which really needs my help, instead of writing letters every day, because I'm the only one really on the outside of this

698
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:02,151
[SPEAKER_12]: City Council out there fighting every day for this issue.

699
01:00:02,812 --> 01:00:04,054
[SPEAKER_12]: It is vitally important.

700
01:00:04,414 --> 01:00:13,229
[SPEAKER_12]: You cannot have an election and have a mayor thwarting public access and all you councilors are at a disadvantage.

701
01:00:13,683 --> 01:00:23,808
[SPEAKER_12]: because he's got the name, he's got the personal videographer paid for with government access money, 75 grand for the mayor's personal videographer, and 45 grand for his personal publicist.

702
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:28,510
[SPEAKER_12]: So all due respect, Councilor Camuso, I believe, when you said that it's going to a good cause.

703
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:37,774
[SPEAKER_12]: No, the public access money for the government channel is going for people who are the mayor's publicist and the mayor's personal videographer, leaving school time right in this room.

704
01:00:37,814 --> 01:00:42,977
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been there, I've seen them, they're not teaching school, they're videotaping the mayor on our dime.

705
01:00:44,126 --> 01:00:45,027
[SPEAKER_12]: You aren't getting that.

706
01:00:45,747 --> 01:00:54,172
[SPEAKER_12]: Michael Marx isn't on TV when the mayor's on TV getting a glitzy ad from Comcast for Maiden Medford, and he appears with the TV3 people he's supposed to be overseeing.

707
01:00:54,452 --> 01:00:55,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Talk about a conflict.

708
01:00:56,053 --> 01:00:59,655
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, Counselor Knight, Counselor Penty, you don't get these glitzy ads.

709
01:01:00,595 --> 01:01:02,036
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're second-class citizens.

710
01:01:02,096 --> 01:01:08,500
[SPEAKER_12]: The mayor is the king, and he's taking advantage of my access fee, which this month, as you see, I gave you a copy of it, $1.64.

711
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,140
[SPEAKER_12]: 12 months, $13.92.

712
01:01:13,802 --> 01:01:14,102
[SPEAKER_12]: OK?

713
01:01:14,542 --> 01:01:14,902
[SPEAKER_12]: A year?

714
01:01:15,603 --> 01:01:15,923
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like $139.20.

715
01:01:16,203 --> 01:01:18,384
[SPEAKER_12]: 10 years?

716
01:01:19,784 --> 01:01:20,104
[SPEAKER_12]: What is it?

717
01:01:21,865 --> 01:01:22,225
[SPEAKER_12]: You got it.

718
01:01:22,925 --> 01:01:26,806
[SPEAKER_12]: And you multiply that times 1,000 people and 10,000 people and 20,000 people.

719
01:01:26,846 --> 01:01:30,268
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a lot of money, to quote Richard Gere from Primal Fear.

720
01:01:30,428 --> 01:01:31,428
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a lot of money.

721
01:01:32,928 --> 01:01:34,389
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm tired of coming up here at the council.

722
01:01:34,509 --> 01:01:40,831
[SPEAKER_12]: I would rather be on TV interviewing my favorite people, be it Vincent Pugliosi with Consul of Camoso, which was a good show.

723
01:01:41,611 --> 01:01:42,432
[SPEAKER_12]: He was great on it.

724
01:01:44,029 --> 01:01:44,349
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

725
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:48,312
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very, very important for this community to get their act together.

726
01:01:49,493 --> 01:01:52,316
[SPEAKER_12]: 57,000 people here and they're getting mushed.

727
01:01:52,836 --> 01:01:53,697
[SPEAKER_12]: They're getting mushed.

728
01:01:56,499 --> 01:02:03,264
[SPEAKER_12]: The restrictions the mayor imposes on the next access station, it's gonna scare a lot of good people away.

729
01:02:04,565 --> 01:02:06,887
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to have a Cable Advisory Committee.

730
01:02:07,167 --> 01:02:12,872
[SPEAKER_12]: I ask, I request of this city council, all seven of you, to reinstate a Cable Advisory Commission.

731
01:02:13,746 --> 01:02:14,907
[SPEAKER_12]: And you're right, have a councilor on it.

732
01:02:14,967 --> 01:02:16,228
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a school committee person on it.

733
01:02:16,268 --> 01:02:17,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Get Bob Skerry back.

734
01:02:18,069 --> 01:02:19,030
[SPEAKER_12]: He knows the landscape.

735
01:02:19,651 --> 01:02:19,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Do it.

736
01:02:20,331 --> 01:02:20,852
[SPEAKER_12]: Please do it.

737
01:02:21,592 --> 01:02:22,673
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a lot more to say on this.

738
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:25,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much for your time.

739
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:37,144
[SPEAKER_11]: The peg access is what pays for the school committee and the city council as well.

740
01:02:37,185 --> 01:02:39,947
[SPEAKER_11]: And we all know as we traverse this community, how many people watch these meetings.

741
01:02:41,108 --> 01:02:42,789
[SPEAKER_11]: And a portion of it is funded.

742
01:02:43,492 --> 01:02:53,515
[SPEAKER_11]: And so once again, I think Councilor Alango-Kern has a great idea, seeing exactly how much of it is paying for Monday nights and Tuesday nights and how much is getting paid elsewhere.

743
01:02:54,176 --> 01:03:00,238
[SPEAKER_11]: But TV3 or whatever the public access station is one portion of it.

744
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:02,679
[SPEAKER_11]: The PEG stands for public education and government.

745
01:03:03,139 --> 01:03:06,180
[SPEAKER_11]: We still have a government channel and we have an education component.

746
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:12,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, the P for public access is missing, but there still is two other channels that are funded through that.

747
01:03:13,686 --> 01:03:14,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councillor.

748
01:03:14,487 --> 01:03:18,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Councillor Knight, inadvertent button tapping there, Councillor.

749
01:03:18,509 --> 01:03:19,670
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry?

750
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:20,330
[SPEAKER_10]: I have nothing to say.

751
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:20,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Hit the button.

752
01:03:20,851 --> 01:03:21,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councillor.

753
01:03:22,652 --> 01:03:24,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Ma'am, please state your name and address for the record.

754
01:03:24,753 --> 01:03:25,154
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

755
01:03:25,194 --> 01:03:26,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

756
01:03:26,474 --> 01:03:29,276
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank Mr. Penta for bringing this very important issue up.

757
01:03:29,717 --> 01:03:33,379
[SPEAKER_00]: This city, I want to keep it simple, deserves a community access station.

758
01:03:33,419 --> 01:03:34,079
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that simple.

759
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:38,763
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that you brought up the 10-year, Mr. Caraviello, the 10-year contract.

760
01:03:39,563 --> 01:03:39,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

761
01:03:39,923 --> 01:03:41,124
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great idea.

762
01:03:41,465 --> 01:03:44,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 5 years or whatever, but 10 years is a stretch.

763
01:03:44,967 --> 01:03:50,872
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, we should have to approve it as a body because all the other contracts are over 3 years.

764
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:51,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent point.

765
01:03:52,313 --> 01:04:00,000
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank Mr. Knight for his suggestion of putting a person from this council to help the negotiation.

766
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:04,023
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's wonderful, especially given the past history with this station.

767
01:04:04,685 --> 01:04:06,286
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor messed it up the last time.

768
01:04:06,326 --> 01:04:07,087
[SPEAKER_00]: It was his ball.

769
01:04:07,187 --> 01:04:07,828
[SPEAKER_00]: He screwed it up.

770
01:04:08,668 --> 01:04:10,690
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to beat that bloody.

771
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:23,961
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to recall that the mayor did hire a little – he put together a three-person committee, which in my mind was skewed or not necessarily qualified.

772
01:04:24,001 --> 01:04:25,822
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a priest, which was a very nice guy.

773
01:04:25,882 --> 01:04:26,423
[SPEAKER_00]: He's honest.

774
01:04:26,643 --> 01:04:28,084
[SPEAKER_00]: But what does he know about cable access?

775
01:04:29,508 --> 01:04:43,235
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a person with conflict of interest who gets paid by the PEG monies, and we had another person who was a nice guy, but he wasn't anybody that really represented the community at large.

776
01:04:43,335 --> 01:04:47,258
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very narrow focus for that committee that he put together.

777
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:54,201
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, he had those recommendations in his hands, okay, and you know what he did with them?

778
01:04:54,221 --> 01:04:56,683
[SPEAKER_00]: He put them in the desk drawer, and he didn't pay any attention to them.

779
01:04:57,523 --> 01:04:58,104
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he did.

780
01:04:58,845 --> 01:05:09,675
[SPEAKER_00]: But he does say that he's going to use the money through the school system, through the voc system, which I'm happy to see that, first of all, again, the bad behavior's gone.

781
01:05:10,096 --> 01:05:10,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God for that.

782
01:05:11,517 --> 01:05:13,760
[SPEAKER_00]: The negative uses of the TV station are gone.

783
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,143
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that, and thank you, Joe, for all your work on that.

784
01:05:18,725 --> 01:05:23,010
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still don't see a station today, and we need to see one.

785
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:33,561
[SPEAKER_00]: We're paying that money, and I think the reason why Mayim McGlynn is doing his dance again is because he's going to wait until the last day of the contract

786
01:05:34,606 --> 01:05:36,148
[SPEAKER_00]: He got the letter December 18th.

787
01:05:36,528 --> 01:05:39,852
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to wait until April 17th or April 16th.

788
01:05:39,892 --> 01:05:47,121
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to hold his meeting and he's not going to want to publicize it because he knows it's going to be a complaint session.

789
01:05:47,661 --> 01:05:50,605
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really told the people, the parents out there,

790
01:05:51,025 --> 01:05:57,289
[SPEAKER_00]: that their kids weren't having their hockey games on TV and everything else, that they're being denied the history, the arts.

791
01:05:57,909 --> 01:06:05,814
[SPEAKER_00]: If they really heard all of that and they really, it penetrated in their soul that they've been denied this, they'd be at that meeting and they'd be saying, what have you done?

792
01:06:06,694 --> 01:06:13,398
[SPEAKER_00]: But they, I don't know, for whatever, because we don't have a good media system, they don't really hear that.

793
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:16,060
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would show up.

794
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:17,460
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are being denied.

795
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day that we don't have a station, we're being denied.

796
01:06:21,028 --> 01:06:30,259
[SPEAKER_00]: a historical log of everything that happens in the city, all of the events, the plays that could be being recorded at the auditorium, and he showed up there.

797
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:32,482
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, you know, the arts community

798
01:06:33,621 --> 01:06:35,842
[SPEAKER_00]: could get on this and do something with it.

799
01:06:36,002 --> 01:06:47,988
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have an arts community, and as far as I can see from all the other communities, the arts people are the ones that run these stations locally, or at least have a huge plug in the system of these systems.

800
01:06:48,028 --> 01:06:48,849
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an arts community.

801
01:06:49,269 --> 01:06:58,274
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor showed up for the 75th anniversary of the Chevalier, and he gave the Chevalier people a plaque for their 75th anniversary.

802
01:06:58,634 --> 01:07:00,275
[SPEAKER_00]: He showed up for that, so he knows the arts people.

803
01:07:00,945 --> 01:07:01,925
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like he doesn't know them.

804
01:07:02,245 --> 01:07:04,086
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't want to invite them in on the process.

805
01:07:05,306 --> 01:07:05,766
[SPEAKER_00]: He hasn't.

806
01:07:05,906 --> 01:07:07,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if he did, they would love that.

807
01:07:07,587 --> 01:07:08,347
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they do.

808
01:07:08,707 --> 01:07:09,627
[SPEAKER_00]: They live for the arts.

809
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:11,007
[SPEAKER_00]: They're musicians.

810
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:12,408
[SPEAKER_00]: They paint.

811
01:07:13,148 --> 01:07:13,928
[SPEAKER_00]: They're creative.

812
01:07:14,228 --> 01:07:15,128
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they do.

813
01:07:15,248 --> 01:07:15,829
[SPEAKER_00]: They love it.

814
01:07:16,129 --> 01:07:19,009
[SPEAKER_00]: And if he reached out to them, he doesn't want to reach out to them.

815
01:07:19,329 --> 01:07:25,571
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he really wants to keep it in a tight little niche for himself so that he can control the media.

816
01:07:26,231 --> 01:07:29,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I hope that the mayor opens up his mind.

817
01:07:30,152 --> 01:07:34,897
[SPEAKER_00]: and lets this city become a thriving city.

818
01:07:35,377 --> 01:07:35,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

819
01:07:37,999 --> 01:07:38,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

820
01:07:39,861 --> 01:07:40,882
[SPEAKER_11]: I can see where this is going.

821
01:07:40,922 --> 01:07:52,312
[SPEAKER_11]: I would anticipate that the mayor is going to say that where this is a renewal, he doesn't need the Medford City Council, as Councilor Caviello pointed out in his wise wisdom.

822
01:07:52,993 --> 01:07:55,595
[SPEAKER_11]: He doesn't need the City Council to give him the approval.

823
01:07:56,253 --> 01:08:07,360
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I think at this point, we should go and temporarily, for the next 60 days, rescind the original vote that was taken under, I believe it had to be under City Manager Galoni at the time.

824
01:08:09,221 --> 01:08:11,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this is technically a renewal, it's not a new contract.

825
01:08:12,263 --> 01:08:21,408
[SPEAKER_11]: So, if we rescind the original vote where the council gave approval... No, no, but it's been a renewal, a renewal, a renewal.

826
01:08:21,808 --> 01:08:24,690
[SPEAKER_11]: The original vote that gave the city administration

827
01:08:25,182 --> 01:08:29,364
[SPEAKER_11]: the green light to move forward of a plus three year contract.

828
01:08:29,944 --> 01:08:40,028
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this city council should take a vote to temporarily rescind it so that he cannot go and sign this tomorrow morning while we're waiting for the city clerk to do his due diligence and pull the original paper.

829
01:08:41,689 --> 01:08:42,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Does it make sense?

830
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:48,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this is a renewal and the administration is going to come back and say, I don't need your consent.

831
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:50,933
[SPEAKER_11]: You gave it to me on the original contract.

832
01:08:52,786 --> 01:08:53,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you see what I'm saying?

833
01:08:54,387 --> 01:08:58,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Where if that vote's rescinded, he can only negotiate a maximum of three years.

834
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:05,674
[SPEAKER_11]: And it, it sounds to me by listening to the council colleague, my council colleagues, no one's really comfortable with a 10-year deal at this point.

835
01:09:07,515 --> 01:09:07,895
[SPEAKER_11]: So then.

836
01:09:08,535 --> 01:09:09,016
[SPEAKER_10]: So then if we.

837
01:09:09,036 --> 01:09:10,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we authorized to rescind something that old?

838
01:09:11,797 --> 01:09:12,718
[SPEAKER_11]: We can rescind anything.

839
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:20,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause he's, he, whatever vote he's banking on saying that he has the authority to do it, that should be rescinded by this council temporarily for 60 days.

840
01:09:21,733 --> 01:09:22,954
[SPEAKER_11]: until we find out where it's going.

841
01:09:24,515 --> 01:09:26,937
[SPEAKER_11]: So, is that in the form of a motion, Councillor?

842
01:09:27,277 --> 01:09:28,478
[SPEAKER_11]: That is in the form of a motion.

843
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:29,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

844
01:09:29,338 --> 01:09:35,323
[SPEAKER_11]: So, on the motion... Well, at least until... At least rescind it until April 15th, is it?

845
01:09:35,343 --> 01:09:41,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Just rescind the renewal period until such time... No, we can't rescind the renewal.

846
01:09:41,907 --> 01:09:46,931
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing we can rescind is the original vote giving him the authority to go over three-year contract.

847
01:09:50,066 --> 01:09:55,269
[SPEAKER_11]: But I agree with that, but I'm afraid tomorrow morning he'll sign this contract knowing that the council's looking for that.

848
01:10:01,233 --> 01:10:13,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if he thinks he can't get his 10-year deal... Can we rescind it for seven days?

849
01:10:13,982 --> 01:10:14,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Rescind it for seven days?

850
01:10:15,423 --> 01:10:16,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Will you support rescinding it for seven days?

851
01:10:19,277 --> 01:10:22,099
[SPEAKER_11]: the original authority for the mayor to negotiate over three years.

852
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:25,422
[SPEAKER_11]: But Ed Finn just told me it's still in effect.

853
01:10:25,442 --> 01:10:26,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Councillor Pinto.

854
01:10:27,303 --> 01:10:40,493
[SPEAKER_05]: To you, Councillor Camuso, I hear what you want to do, and it sounds like it's a good idea, but this is a renewal, and I don't have anything in front of me that says that a renewal becomes automatic by the mayor, because if that's the case, what are we even discussing anything?

855
01:10:40,513 --> 01:10:41,173
[SPEAKER_05]: That's number one.

856
01:10:41,593 --> 01:10:46,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, in one of the pages that we were received here, you know, there's a whole list of

857
01:10:46,921 --> 01:10:49,083
[SPEAKER_05]: what the peg access provider needs to do.

858
01:10:49,403 --> 01:10:53,406
[SPEAKER_05]: It's different than the original contract, or it's an addendum to the original contract.

859
01:10:53,446 --> 01:10:55,908
[SPEAKER_05]: So that in and of itself talks about being different.

860
01:10:56,628 --> 01:11:03,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, not to put you on the hot seat, but the only thing that disturbs me with this whole thing is it says CC here, City Clerk.

861
01:11:03,894 --> 01:11:06,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you ever remember getting this, December 18th?

862
01:11:06,956 --> 01:11:09,038
[SPEAKER_09]: We get a book from the county.

863
01:11:09,618 --> 01:11:11,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Things get processed in the book.

864
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,982
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not always aware of what gets put in the book.

865
01:11:16,632 --> 01:11:17,453
[SPEAKER_09]: as part of the book.

866
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:21,856
[SPEAKER_09]: So did I see it?

867
01:11:22,477 --> 01:11:22,677
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

868
01:11:23,477 --> 01:11:24,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Could it have been put there?

869
01:11:25,139 --> 01:11:25,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

870
01:11:25,779 --> 01:11:32,264
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, so I'm not aware of the timeframe, as I said, unless I timestamped it, you know what I mean?

871
01:11:32,584 --> 01:11:40,491
[SPEAKER_09]: That it came in, but anybody from my staff could have came in there and updated the proposal book, which is a letter.

872
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:42,928
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's probably what happened.

873
01:11:42,968 --> 01:11:43,689
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know.

874
01:11:43,709 --> 01:11:47,350
[SPEAKER_09]: The chair is in doubt of whether or not we can do this.

875
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:48,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me finish my comment, please.

876
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:50,670
[SPEAKER_10]: You made a point of intervention.

877
01:11:50,690 --> 01:11:51,090
[SPEAKER_05]: So wait a minute.

878
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:52,131
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes to the same point.

879
01:11:52,571 --> 01:11:54,271
[SPEAKER_05]: So we heard the clerk say that.

880
01:11:54,531 --> 01:12:04,174
[SPEAKER_05]: But if this has been sitting there since December 18th, because it definitely went to the mayor, and it did go by UPS, and somebody upstairs in his office, and now we're a month and a day away from the four months.

881
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:07,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Something's going on because there's no public hearing being held or anything.

882
01:12:07,275 --> 01:12:14,241
[SPEAKER_10]: This document has been introduced into the council by means that aren't a usual means of introducing a document.

883
01:12:14,762 --> 01:12:26,432
[SPEAKER_10]: So, uh, I have, I'm not clear of what the document is and I think that documents are introduced into the city council for discussion should follow the normal means of doing so.

884
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:29,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, point of clarification, Mr. President, the city clerk is aware of it.

885
01:12:29,835 --> 01:12:32,357
[SPEAKER_05]: He just got through explaining to you how and why it got there.

886
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:35,071
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a document that CCs the council.

887
01:12:35,331 --> 01:12:36,432
[SPEAKER_05]: It's addressed to the mayor.

888
01:12:36,692 --> 01:12:39,314
[SPEAKER_05]: It's regarding a renewal process for which we're talking about.

889
01:12:39,894 --> 01:12:41,575
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a very important issue.

890
01:12:41,595 --> 01:12:46,157
[SPEAKER_11]: The council council president, mr. Counselor Camuso has the floor.

891
01:12:46,357 --> 01:12:48,559
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to, uh, I'm going to withdraw that original motion.

892
01:12:48,999 --> 01:12:56,563
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to make a motion that the city solicitor advises this council on the original paper and respectfully ask the mayor not to sign the contract.

893
01:12:57,078 --> 01:13:00,179
[SPEAKER_11]: until the city solicitor's opinion is back before the Medford City Council.

894
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:21,248
[SPEAKER_11]: And if he goes forward and signs it, full well knowing that the council at this point, just speaking, and I'm not so sure if I'm far against the 10-year contract, but it sounds like several members are, are not far going out, but at least if he signs it between now and then, where we had since December 18th to now, and we're asking for seven days,

895
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,880
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that would be unfair for him to do that at this point.

896
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:31,284
[SPEAKER_10]: So your motion as a C paper is to ask the city solicitor for an opinion.

897
01:13:32,285 --> 01:13:42,992
[SPEAKER_11]: On, on the, to, um, and the city clerk to furnish this council with the original vote that gave the mayor the authority not to negotiate with Comcast.

898
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:49,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it could be Comcast or the authority to negotiation with a cable service provider for over 10 years.

899
01:13:49,996 --> 01:13:50,657
[SPEAKER_11]: And it has to be,

900
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:58,405
[SPEAKER_11]: broader for all cable companies, because the mayor did not need a vote of the city council to give a 10-year contract to Verizon.

901
01:13:59,485 --> 01:14:00,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, wait a minute.

902
01:14:00,546 --> 01:14:02,427
[SPEAKER_10]: And Verizon is running neck and neck with this.

903
01:14:02,788 --> 01:14:06,670
[SPEAKER_10]: The mayor is the contracting authority of the city.

904
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:08,411
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we could ask for that.

905
01:14:08,471 --> 01:14:11,634
[SPEAKER_11]: With that, on the motion of council, Camuso has a seat paper.

906
01:14:11,874 --> 01:14:19,859
[SPEAKER_11]: And also for him not to sign it, respectfully ask him not to sign it within the next seven days, because he knows there is concerns amongst

907
01:14:21,622 --> 01:14:22,883
[SPEAKER_11]: the members of this city council.

908
01:14:23,243 --> 01:14:28,346
[SPEAKER_10]: With the council respectfully requesting that the mayor not enter into the contract for seven days.

909
01:14:28,727 --> 01:14:30,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, can we amend that for it?

910
01:14:30,108 --> 01:14:33,830
[SPEAKER_10]: So Councilor Camuso, Councilor Carviello has the floor next.

911
01:14:34,190 --> 01:14:36,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I move to Councilor, I want to amend his paper.

912
01:14:37,753 --> 01:14:38,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Camuso.

913
01:14:38,333 --> 01:14:39,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Carviello has the floor.

914
01:14:39,854 --> 01:14:40,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll yield to Councilor Penta.

915
01:14:41,615 --> 01:14:49,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Camuso, on your paper, can we amend that one step further as it relates to, you want the city solicitor,

916
01:14:49,789 --> 01:14:51,009
[SPEAKER_05]: likewise to report back.

917
01:14:51,269 --> 01:14:57,810
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, remember, Comcast used to be Time Warner, and before Time Warner was another one.

918
01:14:57,890 --> 01:15:04,812
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have an interloping of three different cable providers here in the city during that period of time.

919
01:15:05,012 --> 01:15:10,273
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think when you change from A to B, that's going to cut the thing to Time Warner.

920
01:15:10,733 --> 01:15:17,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I'd like to amend it to ask the question, when and if the public hearing is going to take place on this renewal?

921
01:15:19,526 --> 01:15:21,328
[SPEAKER_05]: So amended by Councillor Penta.

922
01:15:21,508 --> 01:15:22,829
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're on a seat paper on this.

923
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:23,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Easy.

924
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:24,151
[SPEAKER_11]: This is your paper.

925
01:15:24,191 --> 01:15:24,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Councillor Knight.

926
01:15:40,273 --> 01:15:46,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I think that Councilor Camuso's revised amendment to the paper is the right course of action.

927
01:15:47,495 --> 01:15:57,818
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't feel too comfortable moving forward without first having an opportunity to review the initial and original vote that authorized the mayor to enter into a contract with a cable service provider for a period of time over three years.

928
01:15:58,489 --> 01:16:08,051
[SPEAKER_07]: And getting the city solicitor's opinion is also something that I would have liked to have in my hand before I actually made a vote as to whether or not we would allow the mayor to move forward.

929
01:16:08,071 --> 01:16:16,512
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly think that after the debate and the deliberation that we've had here at this point in time, we have a paper that we can all support and I'd like to move for approval.

930
01:16:17,013 --> 01:16:17,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

931
01:16:17,493 --> 01:16:24,394
[SPEAKER_10]: So on approval of the C paper offered by Councilor Camuso as amended, all those in favor,

932
01:16:25,582 --> 01:16:28,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call vote has been requested on the C paper.

933
01:16:29,443 --> 01:16:30,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk, please read the C paper back to the body.

934
01:16:31,024 --> 01:16:37,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Are these all part of Council Penter's?

935
01:16:37,946 --> 01:16:39,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Council Penter didn't even have a motion.

936
01:16:40,007 --> 01:16:40,827
[SPEAKER_09]: He had a call for discussion.

937
01:16:40,847 --> 01:16:44,049
[SPEAKER_09]: No amendments to his paper, not necessarily B's, C's, and D's.

938
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:46,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, amendments to his paper.

939
01:16:51,731 --> 01:16:53,412
[SPEAKER_09]: But you have the floor.

940
01:16:55,046 --> 01:16:55,746
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your resolution.

941
01:16:56,126 --> 01:16:57,727
[SPEAKER_09]: The resolution was for discussion.

942
01:16:57,767 --> 01:16:59,847
[SPEAKER_09]: The resolution didn't have a resolution.

943
01:16:59,867 --> 01:17:05,508
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're amending your paper, all these things.

944
01:17:05,908 --> 01:17:19,511
[SPEAKER_10]: The A paper, the only resolution we had come out was first, there was no word resolution made or may be resolved until Vice President Longo Kern spoke.

945
01:17:28,118 --> 01:17:28,619
[SPEAKER_10]: That was it.

946
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,261
[SPEAKER_10]: No, B was my paper.

947
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:33,921
[SPEAKER_10]: B was Councilor Nights.

948
01:17:34,261 --> 01:17:38,343
[SPEAKER_10]: So the A, there was no resolution offered by Councilor Penta.

949
01:17:39,324 --> 01:17:43,486
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all amendments off the main paper.

950
01:17:43,666 --> 01:17:44,426
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm just saying.

951
01:17:44,687 --> 01:17:45,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

952
01:17:46,513 --> 01:17:48,073
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all they are.

953
01:17:48,093 --> 01:17:50,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we do one roll call vote on the whole paper?

954
01:17:50,734 --> 01:17:55,255
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a call to make them separate papers, so we're going to vote on them separately.

955
01:17:55,675 --> 01:18:05,918
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the C paper, Mr. Councilor, Mr. On the motion of Councilor Penta that all three papers be reunited as one, seconded by Councilor Garaviello.

956
01:18:06,338 --> 01:18:07,278
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

957
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:11,319
[SPEAKER_10]: For the uniting of the three papers.

958
01:18:12,252 --> 01:18:20,375
[SPEAKER_10]: For the uniting of the three resolutions, the three separate papers, please call the roll, Councilor Mr. Finn.

959
01:18:21,455 --> 01:18:22,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso?

960
01:18:22,296 --> 01:18:22,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

961
01:18:23,016 --> 01:18:23,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caviello?

962
01:18:23,796 --> 01:18:23,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

963
01:18:24,557 --> 01:18:25,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

964
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:25,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

965
01:18:25,957 --> 01:18:26,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Long and Kern?

966
01:18:26,958 --> 01:18:27,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

967
01:18:27,918 --> 01:18:28,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks?

968
01:18:28,498 --> 01:18:28,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

969
01:18:29,418 --> 01:18:29,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Penta?

970
01:18:29,959 --> 01:18:30,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

971
01:18:30,879 --> 01:18:31,579
[SPEAKER_09]: President De La Russa?

972
01:18:31,619 --> 01:18:31,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

973
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:35,821
[SPEAKER_10]: On the vote of seven in the affirmative, none negative, that motion passes.

974
01:18:36,881 --> 01:18:41,083
[SPEAKER_10]: On the main motion, then, as united, roll call vote has been requested.

975
01:18:43,669 --> 01:18:45,090
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion, Councilor Penta.

976
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:46,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't have voted to put the papers together.

977
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:49,031
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to continue to debate on the topic, Mr. President.

978
01:18:50,072 --> 01:18:50,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm sorry.

979
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,153
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to debate the topic.

980
01:18:52,213 --> 01:18:53,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Move to rescind, Mr. President.

981
01:18:53,353 --> 01:18:53,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Last vote.

982
01:18:53,793 --> 01:18:55,974
[SPEAKER_05]: He can move to rescind all he wants.

983
01:18:55,994 --> 01:18:56,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Rescind the last vote.

984
01:18:57,435 --> 01:18:58,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor, we've called for a vote on this.

985
01:18:59,596 --> 01:18:59,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Pardon me?

986
01:18:59,916 --> 01:19:00,996
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've called for a vote.

987
01:19:01,016 --> 01:19:03,357
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to tell me I can't speak on the motion now?

988
01:19:04,258 --> 01:19:05,158
[SPEAKER_10]: You've never done that before.

989
01:19:05,498 --> 01:19:06,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this one of your new rules?

990
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:07,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Move to rescind, Mr. President.

991
01:19:07,839 --> 01:19:09,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to rescind by Councilor Knight.

992
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,701
[SPEAKER_10]: I move for reconsideration.

993
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,408
[SPEAKER_10]: We're open for reconsideration, Councilor Knight.

994
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:18,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Reconsideration of what?

995
01:19:19,109 --> 01:19:21,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Of the vote to put all the papers, to unite the papers, Mr. President.

996
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:27,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I voted to unite the papers because I felt as though we had an agreement here amongst the members of this council that this is something that we can all support.

997
01:19:28,232 --> 01:19:32,634
[SPEAKER_07]: As such, if we're all going to support it, we can stop debate and we can support the measure and we can move forward on it.

998
01:19:32,914 --> 01:19:38,756
[SPEAKER_07]: If in fact, we're going to merge all the papers together and then continue debate on it and then start adding to it again, I have concerns about that.

999
01:19:38,776 --> 01:19:39,936
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to keep my paper separate.

1000
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:44,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you didn't even let me finish the reason why I just said before that.

1001
01:19:47,072 --> 01:19:47,552
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

1002
01:19:47,652 --> 01:19:48,172
[SPEAKER_05]: He's so quick.

1003
01:19:48,192 --> 01:19:49,313
[SPEAKER_05]: He thinks he can read my mind.

1004
01:19:49,393 --> 01:19:50,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Let him take his vote.

1005
01:19:53,074 --> 01:19:54,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not out after you at all.

1006
01:19:55,314 --> 01:19:56,234
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not out after you at all.

1007
01:19:56,975 --> 01:19:59,835
[SPEAKER_07]: What I want to do is I want to preserve my paper, and I don't know what's going to come up.

1008
01:19:59,855 --> 01:20:01,936
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what's going to come up.

1009
01:20:01,956 --> 01:20:03,697
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a motion to rescind on the floor.

1010
01:20:04,397 --> 01:20:05,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1011
01:20:07,318 --> 01:20:07,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Rescinding?

1012
01:20:08,078 --> 01:20:08,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Rescinding.

1013
01:20:17,955 --> 01:20:18,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso?

1014
01:20:18,835 --> 01:20:19,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1015
01:20:19,956 --> 01:20:20,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caviello?

1016
01:20:20,837 --> 01:20:20,937
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1017
01:20:22,198 --> 01:20:22,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

1018
01:20:22,778 --> 01:20:23,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1019
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:24,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Long and Kern?

1020
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:25,060
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1021
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:26,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks?

1022
01:20:26,941 --> 01:20:29,143
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1023
01:20:29,163 --> 01:20:29,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Penta?

1024
01:20:29,963 --> 01:20:31,164
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1025
01:20:31,184 --> 01:20:32,025
[SPEAKER_09]: President DelaRusso?

1026
01:20:32,145 --> 01:20:32,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1027
01:20:32,886 --> 01:20:37,229
[SPEAKER_10]: The vote of three in the affirmative, four negative.

1028
01:20:37,729 --> 01:20:38,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion fails.

1029
01:20:40,471 --> 01:20:44,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Penta on the motion for approval.

1030
01:20:46,281 --> 01:20:46,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Move approval.

1031
01:20:47,662 --> 01:20:48,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to.

1032
01:20:48,922 --> 01:20:51,363
[SPEAKER_05]: No, listen, no, because he thought he was so smart.

1033
01:20:51,383 --> 01:20:52,223
[SPEAKER_05]: He knew what he was going to do.

1034
01:20:52,243 --> 01:20:53,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing about being smart.

1035
01:20:53,464 --> 01:20:56,425
[SPEAKER_10]: It had more to do about me preserving my interests and less about me being smart.

1036
01:20:56,485 --> 01:20:57,446
[SPEAKER_10]: United Peace.

1037
01:21:04,088 --> 01:21:04,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso.

1038
01:21:04,769 --> 01:21:04,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1039
01:21:06,149 --> 01:21:06,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caviello.

1040
01:21:06,909 --> 01:21:07,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1041
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:08,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

1042
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:08,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1043
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:10,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Long and Kern.

1044
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:10,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1045
01:21:11,091 --> 01:21:11,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Mox.

1046
01:21:11,911 --> 01:21:12,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1047
01:21:12,612 --> 01:21:13,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Penta.

1048
01:21:13,132 --> 01:21:13,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1049
01:21:14,307 --> 01:21:15,027
[SPEAKER_09]: President Del Rosso.

1050
01:21:15,107 --> 01:21:19,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, with the vote of seven, the affirmative, none negative, the measure passes.

1051
01:21:19,049 --> 01:21:29,673
[SPEAKER_10]: 15-098 offered by Councilor Penta, be it resolved that an update to last week's proposed citizen street recovery program be discussed.

1052
01:21:29,793 --> 01:21:30,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Penta.

1053
01:21:32,174 --> 01:21:37,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Since last week, I received, I think it was 14 phone calls from folks who thought this was a good idea.

1054
01:21:37,176 --> 01:21:43,158
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that they have spoken to some folks in the highway department who also thought it was a good idea, which would be helpful to them.

1055
01:21:44,282 --> 01:22:13,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Subsequent to last week, and I want to thank our city clerk, Mr. Finn, he sent me in a direction that brought me to a town in Florida, Jacksonville, Florida, that engaged in something quite similar, not exactly the same, but quite similar as it relates to groups of citizens getting together within the community, finding storefronts, vacant spots, spots that need to be rehabilitated, going to the landowners and to the city and working out deals as it relates to, once again,

1056
01:22:13,972 --> 01:22:15,674
[SPEAKER_05]: bringing their streets back to life.

1057
01:22:16,835 --> 01:22:31,687
[SPEAKER_05]: This whole idea of the street recovery program includes curbing, the lights, paneled sidewalks, and parts of the city and parts of the sections of the business districts that are just not getting any life at all.

1058
01:22:32,628 --> 01:22:40,334
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a master plan that I believe should work hand in hand with the new Department of Public Works building that we're having built for $15 million.

1059
01:22:41,634 --> 01:23:01,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, at the same time, it's, I won't call it an adjunct, but it runs itself similar to the Mass Department of Public Transportation on their new Mass Highway Street Identifying Program, where I think they're up to over 300 folks who either sent in pitches or sent in locations where there are potholes on the major highways here of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1060
01:23:02,191 --> 01:23:05,854
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's a catch that we can take advantage of.

1061
01:23:06,534 --> 01:23:10,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, it's something that seems to be getting good response.

1062
01:23:13,474 --> 01:23:28,320
[SPEAKER_05]: On another issue, liking to this, in downtown Medford Square, in the heart of your business district, you have five lights out within, five street lights out, in the major part of your downtown area, and they've been out for almost three to four weeks.

1063
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:39,524
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you're not gonna have people come in, I don't know what the mayor can't see on a daily basis, but when you let your street lights out, you're losing visibility, number one, but you're presenting a public safety matter.

1064
01:23:40,304 --> 01:23:43,025
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is something that it's inherent in this whole idea

1065
01:23:43,441 --> 01:23:44,802
[SPEAKER_05]: of the Street Recovery Program.

1066
01:23:45,423 --> 01:23:49,886
[SPEAKER_05]: And bringing it up for the 14th time, I will bring it up, and that's the parking lot behind St.

1067
01:23:49,926 --> 01:23:51,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Joseph's Church on Route 16.

1068
01:23:51,968 --> 01:23:59,494
[SPEAKER_05]: No lights, a definite public safety problem, and it doesn't offer anything for the people of this community after five o'clock at night when it gets dark.

1069
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:12,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's a little bit lighter, but all winter long, and as I explained before, we had a couple of incidences over the year where there was a drug deal that went on in one situation, another lady got afraid to go to her car because there were people in the parking lot, and still nothing has taken place.

1070
01:24:13,084 --> 01:24:17,387
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been told by the city that they're responsible for it for the five years that they have the contract.

1071
01:24:17,747 --> 01:24:18,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the contract is up.

1072
01:24:19,288 --> 01:24:22,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what's going on after that, but again, it's a public safety issue.

1073
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:27,293
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just want to bring attention to the fact that again, I want to thank Mr. Finn.

1074
01:24:27,533 --> 01:24:31,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you sent me in a direction that sent me in a further direction, uh, which has been very helpful.

1075
01:24:31,636 --> 01:24:33,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just continue to bring on more and more information.

1076
01:24:34,098 --> 01:24:40,862
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would hope that the mayor takes advantage of this and jumps on board with this because the citizen road recovery program, you can go down any street in the city.

1077
01:24:41,511 --> 01:24:44,352
[SPEAKER_05]: every major pothole that's taking place.

1078
01:24:44,912 --> 01:24:49,553
[SPEAKER_05]: And Department of Public Works folks, I mean, they can't see every pothole because it's obvious, there's a lot of them.

1079
01:24:49,993 --> 01:24:59,295
[SPEAKER_05]: But the people of this community, there's 57, 58,000 of you, you could be the eyes and ears of every street, every corner, every sidewalk, every light, every manhole cover, whatever it might be out there.

1080
01:24:59,755 --> 01:25:09,538
[SPEAKER_05]: It would make a great inventory to start with for the Department of Public Works to go forward and take back and rejuvenate these city streets and sidewalks that are just in desperate need of repair.

1081
01:25:10,138 --> 01:25:11,098
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to,

1082
01:25:11,488 --> 01:25:12,969
[SPEAKER_05]: bring that to the attention of the council.

1083
01:25:16,051 --> 01:25:16,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's part of it.

1084
01:25:16,991 --> 01:25:23,255
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing is the mayor going to respond back on this, because if he's not going to do it, I think it's another issue that the council needs to address.

1085
01:25:27,237 --> 01:25:28,238
[SPEAKER_10]: For the mayor to report back.

1086
01:25:28,258 --> 01:25:31,560
[SPEAKER_10]: The mayor to report back on the street recovery program.

1087
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:32,300
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1088
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:32,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1089
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:33,601
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1090
01:25:33,721 --> 01:25:36,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

1091
01:25:36,042 --> 01:25:37,423
[SPEAKER_10]: 15-099 offered by Councillor Penta.

1092
01:25:37,863 --> 01:25:40,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Craddock Bridge be discussed.

1093
01:25:40,145 --> 01:25:40,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Councillor?

1094
01:25:40,817 --> 01:25:45,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, not since I believe, I think it was, I see somebody from the audience sitting over there.

1095
01:25:45,881 --> 01:25:53,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was in either January or February last year when we met, is the last time we had any discussion on this issue of the Craddock Bridge.

1096
01:25:53,727 --> 01:25:58,050
[SPEAKER_05]: We've received no updates from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1097
01:25:59,511 --> 01:26:10,339
[SPEAKER_05]: And now from what the reference, and I have a whole folder here, and from what I understand, and this is just scuttlebutt because I haven't gotten it from anybody, what was supposed to have been started last fall is not happening.

1098
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:13,747
[SPEAKER_05]: was supposed to be starting this spring, and it's right here.

1099
01:26:13,908 --> 01:26:14,708
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not happening.

1100
01:26:15,108 --> 01:26:20,051
[SPEAKER_05]: And nobody has any idea when this Kratik Bridge is going to see any kind of resurrection or what have you.

1101
01:26:20,871 --> 01:26:35,418
[SPEAKER_05]: But taking that also into consideration, this idea that it would take over a year to remove or to move all the underground conduits that represent telephone lines, electricity, and everything, that's kind of hard to believe.

1102
01:26:35,458 --> 01:26:39,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when you speak to other engineers in other cities and towns, and you explain this to them,

1103
01:26:39,930 --> 01:26:41,210
[SPEAKER_05]: They just can't understand.

1104
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:44,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, with the technology that's out there today, why does it have to take a year?

1105
01:26:45,332 --> 01:26:48,173
[SPEAKER_05]: But not only that, this bridge has been there for well over 100 years.

1106
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:49,394
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not sinking.

1107
01:26:50,174 --> 01:26:53,995
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess the better question is, why do we have to get ourselves even involved?

1108
01:26:54,035 --> 01:26:57,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's now up to over a $13 million bridge as of last year.

1109
01:26:58,737 --> 01:27:06,460
[SPEAKER_05]: For maybe the bridge just needs a pavement, a reconstruction on the top portion of it, rather than going through this multi-million dollar extravaganza.

1110
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:13,264
[SPEAKER_05]: The businesses in Medford Square cannot handle another setback and an opportunity to go forward.

1111
01:27:13,644 --> 01:27:20,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Bad enough, there's no reason for anyone to want to come to Medford Square at nighttime, other than two restaurants.

1112
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:21,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Name it.

1113
01:27:22,012 --> 01:27:23,333
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no bookstore, that's gone.

1114
01:27:23,353 --> 01:27:24,194
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no movie theater.

1115
01:27:24,374 --> 01:27:25,535
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing there for the kids.

1116
01:27:26,336 --> 01:27:28,538
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no arts and crafts that are taking place.

1117
01:27:29,279 --> 01:27:32,962
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a professional office community in downtown Medford.

1118
01:27:33,805 --> 01:27:35,667
[SPEAKER_05]: And banks, and banks, excuse me.

1119
01:27:35,787 --> 01:27:37,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Banks, pizza parlors, and hairdressers.

1120
01:27:37,509 --> 01:27:38,751
[SPEAKER_05]: But they all close at nighttime.

1121
01:27:39,893 --> 01:27:42,475
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we talk about rejuvenating Medford Square.

1122
01:27:42,835 --> 01:27:47,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Under this administration, he's talked about it three times, and three times, this is what you have.

1123
01:27:48,058 --> 01:27:56,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Stores that are continuously being empty, nothing that fosters good growth and good development, and there's absolutely no diversity in the type of businesses that are in Medford Square.

1124
01:27:57,103 --> 01:28:08,449
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we're still dealing with the bridge that have people still concerned that if the bridge goes in, what happens to their business, or how is it going to affect traffic, the public safety, and the bridge that's on the Route 9.

1125
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:09,470
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, here's another thing.

1126
01:28:09,939 --> 01:28:14,381
[SPEAKER_05]: When you go to Meffitt Square on Main Street, the overpass there, the lights are all out.

1127
01:28:14,401 --> 01:28:16,122
[SPEAKER_05]: They're down to one light.

1128
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:18,202
[SPEAKER_05]: There used to be six lights, and they're all out.

1129
01:28:18,883 --> 01:28:19,423
[SPEAKER_05]: You call up.

1130
01:28:19,783 --> 01:28:20,323
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not us.

1131
01:28:20,463 --> 01:28:21,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Call the city.

1132
01:28:21,044 --> 01:28:22,144
[SPEAKER_05]: The city says it's the state.

1133
01:28:22,424 --> 01:28:23,625
[SPEAKER_05]: The state says it's DCR.

1134
01:28:24,085 --> 01:28:27,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know whose responsibility it is, but it's a public safety issue.

1135
01:28:27,326 --> 01:28:35,790
[SPEAKER_05]: And as this continues to go on, the Craddock Bridge seems to be the culprit, so to speak, because everything revolves around what's going to come out of the Craddock Bridge.

1136
01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:38,931
[SPEAKER_05]: All kinds of monies are supposedly tied into the Craddock Bridge.

1137
01:28:39,658 --> 01:28:48,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I think we need a response back from the Commonwealth of Mass, not from the mayor, not from any other politician, from the Commonwealth of Mass.

1138
01:28:48,505 --> 01:28:50,346
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on their agenda to do.

1139
01:28:50,486 --> 01:28:56,671
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to know, and I think all the businesses need to know, when they're coming into the city and they're going to begin business.

1140
01:28:56,871 --> 01:29:09,320
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councillor Pentland, the Department of Transportation informed the Medford City Council by way of update on the progress, start date, and status of the Pratt

1141
01:29:09,868 --> 01:29:12,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Bridge Replacement Program.

1142
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:14,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call has been requested.

1143
01:29:17,332 --> 01:29:18,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

1144
01:29:26,237 --> 01:29:27,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso?

1145
01:29:27,318 --> 01:29:27,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1146
01:29:27,978 --> 01:29:28,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caviello?

1147
01:29:29,079 --> 01:29:29,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1148
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:30,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

1149
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:30,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1150
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Lowell-Kern?

1151
01:29:32,021 --> 01:29:32,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1152
01:29:32,881 --> 01:29:33,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks?

1153
01:29:33,902 --> 01:29:34,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1154
01:29:34,542 --> 01:29:35,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Penta?

1155
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:35,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1156
01:29:36,143 --> 01:29:36,944
[SPEAKER_09]: President DelaRusso?

1157
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:37,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1158
01:29:38,150 --> 01:29:40,431
[SPEAKER_10]: 7 in the affirmative, none negative, the motion carries.

1159
01:29:43,253 --> 01:29:48,936
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a couple of items of sympathy and a couple of items of congratulations.

1160
01:29:48,996 --> 01:29:58,481
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of Councilor Penta to go under suspension to take 15-296.

1161
01:29:59,022 --> 01:29:59,842
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1162
01:30:00,302 --> 01:30:01,143
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1163
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:03,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

1164
01:30:04,004 --> 01:30:05,405
[SPEAKER_10]: 15-296 offered by Councilor Penta.

1165
01:30:05,822 --> 01:30:13,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the continuing citizen problems regarding the mayor's pay to park kiosks be shared, Councilor Penta.

1166
01:30:13,509 --> 01:30:23,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I guess it's now starting to escalate to the point that people are willing to acknowledge what's going on.

1167
01:30:24,059 --> 01:30:28,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Today, having an at length conversation with Medford Pediatrics and Medford Square.

1168
01:30:29,057 --> 01:30:33,299
[SPEAKER_05]: and with a three and a half page memo that was sent to me by the employees.

1169
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:37,980
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have the names that they are acknowledged and are willing to have made public.

1170
01:30:38,541 --> 01:30:40,601
[SPEAKER_05]: These are people who come there with their children.

1171
01:30:40,941 --> 01:30:42,042
[SPEAKER_05]: These are senior citizens.

1172
01:30:42,062 --> 01:30:44,923
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the doctor that runs the place that's in charge.

1173
01:30:44,983 --> 01:30:47,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me, this is the nurse who's in charge.

1174
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:55,607
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just an ongoing saga that just took place over the past couple of days, starting off with a senior citizen,

1175
01:30:56,400 --> 01:31:07,963
[SPEAKER_05]: A husband and a wife went there and they were just so upset as to how to handle the kiosk that they had to come into the office of Medford Pediatrics to get some help as it relates to that.

1176
01:31:08,683 --> 01:31:17,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I believe somebody from Medford Pediatrics made a request to the mayor concerning some of the concerns that they had and they never got a response back from the mayor.

1177
01:31:18,569 --> 01:31:20,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, parents having to go back.

1178
01:31:20,530 --> 01:31:26,554
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a situation here where a lady came in with a stroller and with her kids, not realizing that the kiosks were there.

1179
01:31:26,754 --> 01:31:29,056
[SPEAKER_05]: We have pictures here that the kiosks were there.

1180
01:31:29,756 --> 01:31:34,119
[SPEAKER_05]: And recognizing that the kiosks were there, she had to go back out and she had to leave her kid.

1181
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:40,223
[SPEAKER_05]: And while the kid was in the, as everybody knows, if you have a little child, especially at a young age, the kid was screaming and yelling.

1182
01:31:40,243 --> 01:31:41,784
[SPEAKER_05]: The kid didn't want the mother to leave.

1183
01:31:42,445 --> 01:31:47,208
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately she winds up getting a ticket, not knowing that she had to go back out there and put the money into the kiosk.

1184
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:55,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we have another situation where the people who put the change in didn't have an exchange, and they had no credit card.

1185
01:31:56,706 --> 01:32:00,928
[SPEAKER_05]: They always came paid by a check, not knowing that the kiosks were there.

1186
01:32:01,569 --> 01:32:15,197
[SPEAKER_05]: So having no money to put either change or whatever, they had to go, once again, ask the people in the method pediatrics if we could have some change to go out there for which they were

1187
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:19,951
[SPEAKER_05]: gracious enough to do, but at the same time, unfortunately, once again, they got a ticket.

1188
01:32:20,152 --> 01:32:29,474
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, the gentleman in the little white car that goes into that pocket, and by all of these people, have been represented as being very rude to the people and their concerns.

1189
01:32:30,255 --> 01:32:38,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, today, I believe, mother's name is Kim Ruane, not accepting coins, and that was giving out the wrong receipts.

1190
01:32:38,878 --> 01:32:42,959
[SPEAKER_05]: So as she went in and put her money in, another lady came in,

1191
01:32:43,886 --> 01:32:52,270
[SPEAKER_05]: not realizing that she had to put the money in, and then she did put the money in, but the receipt was not the right receipt with the right registration for the right person.

1192
01:32:53,811 --> 01:32:57,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just hoping that the counselor can share with us the address and the location of Medford Pediatrics.

1193
01:32:57,873 --> 01:33:02,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford Pediatrics in Medford Square on the corner of Riverside Avenue where the city-owned parking lot is.

1194
01:33:02,595 --> 01:33:05,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's Mystic Valley Pediatrics.

1195
01:33:05,076 --> 01:33:06,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Mystic Valley, I'm sorry, Mystic Valley Pediatrics.

1196
01:33:07,297 --> 01:33:07,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

1197
01:33:07,637 --> 01:33:07,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

1198
01:33:10,263 --> 01:33:12,883
[SPEAKER_05]: They were given the wrong receipts after they put in the right number.

1199
01:33:13,564 --> 01:33:18,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there was a lady who parked her car on, where is this one here?

1200
01:33:18,565 --> 01:33:26,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, here was a car, she pulled up to the spot, and once she pulled up to the spot, she was going to get out of the car and to go to the kiosk.

1201
01:33:27,186 --> 01:33:29,066
[SPEAKER_05]: And the guy was giving her a ticket.

1202
01:33:30,367 --> 01:33:35,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and she said, I'm going to the kiosk to put the money in, and she got the ticket.

1203
01:33:36,288 --> 01:33:37,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And not only did she get the ticket,

1204
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:43,012
[SPEAKER_05]: She put the money in the ticket, and she came back, and she says, look it here.

1205
01:33:43,473 --> 01:33:48,016
[SPEAKER_05]: He grabbed the receipt from her and gave her another ticket because there was no money.

1206
01:33:48,056 --> 01:33:50,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Because look it, that's the wrong registration on there.

1207
01:33:50,618 --> 01:33:54,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he probably thought, for whatever it might be, she was lying, or whatever it could be.

1208
01:33:55,262 --> 01:33:56,763
[SPEAKER_05]: So she winds up getting two tickets.

1209
01:33:57,103 --> 01:33:59,445
[SPEAKER_05]: And this seems to be symptomatic for three people.

1210
01:33:59,525 --> 01:34:06,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Then another lady in Mystic Valley Pediatrics went in after her, showed her receipt, and the receipt had her registration number on it.

1211
01:34:08,152 --> 01:34:09,633
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not making any sense at all.

1212
01:34:10,068 --> 01:34:14,211
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a dentist in Medford Square where a person went in to have some work done in the dentist shop.

1213
01:34:14,271 --> 01:34:18,475
[SPEAKER_05]: And while they're in the dentist shop, one of the ladies that were in there said, I have to leave.

1214
01:34:18,535 --> 01:34:19,015
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean?

1215
01:34:19,135 --> 01:34:20,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I was an employee.

1216
01:34:20,356 --> 01:34:21,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to leave.

1217
01:34:21,157 --> 01:34:22,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to go put money in the meter.

1218
01:34:22,718 --> 01:34:23,839
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just around lunchtime.

1219
01:34:23,859 --> 01:34:25,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to go put money in the meter.

1220
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:35,088
[SPEAKER_05]: She goes out putting money in the meter, and she left the poor dentist in the shop with a lady sitting on the chair that she had to get another secretary to come in and help her out.

1221
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:36,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

1222
01:34:38,222 --> 01:34:40,143
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not making any sense at all.

1223
01:34:40,163 --> 01:34:43,406
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a whole bunch of things.

1224
01:34:43,446 --> 01:34:55,676
[SPEAKER_05]: No, these people are coming forward, and what they're upset about is that they addressed this to the mayor's office with absolutely no response, and that's just plain rudeness, whether you agree to disagree to the whole nine yards.

1225
01:34:56,857 --> 01:34:58,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't know.

1226
01:34:59,219 --> 01:35:03,442
[SPEAKER_05]: As we continue to go, and here's the pictures of the parking lot.

1227
01:35:04,634 --> 01:35:16,797
[SPEAKER_05]: against the wall where Mystic Valley Pediatric Center, you have these two kiosks, and you have people parked almost 250 feet away who are basically coming here maybe for the first time, not even knowing what's going on.

1228
01:35:17,517 --> 01:35:18,858
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a sighting section.

1229
01:35:19,258 --> 01:35:22,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, another violation of the contract on page 11.

1230
01:35:23,790 --> 01:35:31,115
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, operators' vehicles, the rear of all vehicles shall have a sign warning of frequent vehicle stops.

1231
01:35:32,016 --> 01:35:43,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we are again this week with the location, same truck, same vehicle, in the square, and no sign on the back making stops.

1232
01:35:43,304 --> 01:35:44,965
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a clear violation of the contract.

1233
01:35:45,405 --> 01:35:47,747
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got it now three weeks in a row with pitches.

1234
01:35:48,627 --> 01:35:49,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what the mayor thinks that

1235
01:35:50,089 --> 01:35:54,571
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great that he thinks this Republic company from Tennessee is doing a wonderful job, but I don't think so.

1236
01:35:55,452 --> 01:36:11,019
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're starting to get people like this from Mystic Valley Pediatrics willing to come forward and use their names and they're not afraid of it because they're upset and they're really PO'd that the mayor would be disrespectful not even to respond, that's starting to tell the story and it's starting to escalate throughout this entire community.

1237
01:36:11,839 --> 01:36:17,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would hope that anyone who has a concern about this keeps on bringing them in, keeps on expressing them.

1238
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:21,790
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, how do you put your money into the machine, and how do you get the wrong number to come out?

1239
01:36:22,530 --> 01:36:27,972
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it was a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, somebody put money in the machine, and they got more money back than what they put in.

1240
01:36:30,392 --> 01:36:34,933
[SPEAKER_05]: So where's that meter at, you know?

1241
01:36:40,435 --> 01:36:41,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know something?

1242
01:36:43,257 --> 01:36:59,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether you're for it or against it, it's that one lady who wanted to do what she thought was the right thing to do—it's probably going on three weeks now—went to Medford Square, went to go put the money in the meter, fell on the bank, and got rushed to the emergency room in the Lawrence Memorial by ambulance because she didn't want to get the ticket.

1243
01:36:59,850 --> 01:37:02,172
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, that, to me, is the whole story.

1244
01:37:02,432 --> 01:37:06,535
[SPEAKER_05]: This is more than the whole story, but this is just symptomatic as to what's going on.

1245
01:37:07,135 --> 01:37:08,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caviello, you said 60 days.

1246
01:37:08,977 --> 01:37:10,298
[SPEAKER_05]: The 60 days, I believe, is up.

1247
01:37:10,963 --> 01:37:11,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

1248
01:37:11,823 --> 01:37:14,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know where the report is, but I can tell you this.

1249
01:37:14,684 --> 01:37:16,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what I'm going to do once that 60 days comes in.

1250
01:37:17,504 --> 01:37:21,425
[SPEAKER_05]: So, apparently, they have no respect for the resolution of the Council ER request.

1251
01:37:21,945 --> 01:37:27,047
[SPEAKER_05]: This is now the 17th, and, you know, this isn't me talking.

1252
01:37:27,407 --> 01:37:29,207
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all information that can be backed up.

1253
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:32,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's there.

1254
01:37:33,068 --> 01:37:33,688
[SPEAKER_05]: What can I tell you?

1255
01:37:35,515 --> 01:37:45,058
[SPEAKER_05]: It's anti-business, and if this is what Mayor McGlynn wants, to tax the people to death with another bogus tax the people, beside everything else, that's a damn shame.

1256
01:37:49,259 --> 01:38:03,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, my resolution is that, number one, I would like to have Councilor Caviello's resolution of the first 60 days reported back as to revenues, and I think also, I think they need to come back and reappear before us, Republic,

1257
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:08,825
[SPEAKER_05]: As to what all these inconsistencies and these happenings, I mean, how are they going to address them?

1258
01:38:09,085 --> 01:38:18,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we also add your litany that you gave us tonight to be forwarded to the Traffic Commission for action or answers?

1259
01:38:18,614 --> 01:38:19,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I got no problem with that.

1260
01:38:20,196 --> 01:38:22,478
[SPEAKER_05]: And also the fact that you have a violation of the contract.

1261
01:38:22,825 --> 01:38:26,868
[SPEAKER_05]: The cars are still not properly identified, as the contract says it is.

1262
01:38:27,549 --> 01:38:39,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I believe you have people that will call up and tell you that they're getting tickets for parking on permit streets that still haven't even been identified by Republic as being updated and corrected.

1263
01:38:43,561 --> 01:38:46,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I think bringing Republic here is all well and good.

1264
01:38:46,704 --> 01:38:50,467
[SPEAKER_07]: However, Republic's job in the function that they're tasked with

1265
01:38:50,945 --> 01:38:53,066
[SPEAKER_07]: is to enforce the existing city ordinance.

1266
01:38:53,846 --> 01:38:59,148
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that the scope and purview and directive that they're receiving is coming from the Traffic Commission.

1267
01:38:59,168 --> 01:39:00,889
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can bring Republic here all we want.

1268
01:39:01,829 --> 01:39:03,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Republic's still gonna do what they're gonna do.

1269
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:08,252
[SPEAKER_07]: The Traffic Commission is the body that has the oversight and the control and the ability to direct them to do certain things.

1270
01:39:08,612 --> 01:39:14,695
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that if we're gonna do anything, we should bring the Traffic Commission here because the Traffic Commission is the policymaking arm that's in charge of this parking program.

1271
01:39:14,715 --> 01:39:16,675
[SPEAKER_07]: They're the policymaking arm that makes these decisions.

1272
01:39:16,695 --> 01:39:19,817
[SPEAKER_07]: They're the policymaking arm that's reduced the parking hours from seven to seven

1273
01:39:21,457 --> 01:39:24,260
[SPEAKER_07]: 8 to 6, so they're the ones that can effectuate change.

1274
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:27,302
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that those are the people that really need to be here, Mr. President, would be the Traffic Commission.

1275
01:39:27,762 --> 01:39:29,624
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Traffic Commission is invited.

1276
01:39:30,184 --> 01:39:31,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Councillor Camuso.

1277
01:39:31,545 --> 01:39:31,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1278
01:39:32,826 --> 01:39:43,635
[SPEAKER_11]: I would ask Councillor Pente's resolutions, if we could send his papers to the Mayor too, because a few weeks ago at the Mayor's press conference, he publicly stated he hasn't got any phone calls on this.

1279
01:39:44,656 --> 01:39:48,659
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that some of the businesses that he mentioned on TV,

1280
01:39:50,915 --> 01:39:53,556
[SPEAKER_11]: that were in favor of this, the best thing that's ever happened to Medford.

1281
01:39:54,937 --> 01:39:59,039
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got some people upset with those particular businesses for thinking that.

1282
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:07,424
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could ask the mayor to take a look at these complaints, because as of that press conference, his office has not received one complaint about it.

1283
01:40:07,704 --> 01:40:10,245
[SPEAKER_11]: The only things he heard was that this is great.

1284
01:40:10,345 --> 01:40:14,147
[SPEAKER_11]: And this, as the mayor said at his press conference, the record doesn't lie.

1285
01:40:15,168 --> 01:40:17,489
[SPEAKER_11]: That's exactly what he said at the press conference.

1286
01:40:17,649 --> 01:40:18,790
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was posted on medford.org.

1287
01:40:19,552 --> 01:40:20,513
[SPEAKER_11]: and several other things.

1288
01:40:20,653 --> 01:40:27,958
[SPEAKER_11]: This is when he, um, it was the same press conference that he talked about his new, um, ad hoc, um, substance abuse program.

1289
01:40:28,739 --> 01:40:38,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, as well as council Lungo Kern had a, had a request on the council resolution for the update on DPW equipment, uh, as sand and salt.

1290
01:40:38,506 --> 01:40:47,293
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's the press conference basically, basically talk to may have basically talked about everything that was on the council agenda.

1291
01:40:48,341 --> 01:40:49,302
[SPEAKER_11]: was the whole press conference.

1292
01:40:49,342 --> 01:40:59,710
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I mean, if he isn't getting any of these complaints, then I would ask people to call his office rather than Councilor Penter and the rest of the council, because we need to let him know what people are saying.

1293
01:40:59,730 --> 01:41:05,274
[SPEAKER_11]: There's obviously, his number must not be published or something, because all the calls seem to be coming to us.

1294
01:41:06,195 --> 01:41:06,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1295
01:41:06,955 --> 01:41:08,917
[SPEAKER_10]: So, as amended by Councilor Camuso,

1296
01:41:09,648 --> 01:41:13,411
[SPEAKER_10]: For the motion of approval, all those in favor, oh, sir, you wanna speak, I apologize.

1297
01:41:13,731 --> 01:41:15,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1298
01:41:15,292 --> 01:41:15,572
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

1299
01:41:15,793 --> 01:41:18,735
[SPEAKER_06]: My name's Nick Tomazook, I live at 29 Garfield Ave.

1300
01:41:19,636 --> 01:41:30,624
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, with all these inconsistencies with this company and all these problems, isn't there any way we can get the city solicitor to look over that contract to see if we can rescind it?

1301
01:41:32,185 --> 01:41:33,466
[SPEAKER_06]: There must be something in there.

1302
01:41:34,747 --> 01:41:36,789
[SPEAKER_06]: There is something in there to get rid of these guys.

1303
01:41:39,077 --> 01:41:42,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Initially, this wasn't what people were looking for in the city.

1304
01:41:42,779 --> 01:41:48,241
[SPEAKER_06]: All they were looking for was parking enforcement, not this monster that he brought in here.

1305
01:41:50,222 --> 01:41:50,962
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it is.

1306
01:41:51,022 --> 01:41:51,923
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a monster.

1307
01:41:52,163 --> 01:41:57,525
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a cancer, a disease that's preying on good and old people.

1308
01:41:59,446 --> 01:42:02,188
[SPEAKER_06]: And now they want to change these screens that we have to pay for?

1309
01:42:03,048 --> 01:42:05,009
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to change the signs we have to pay for?

1310
01:42:06,422 --> 01:42:09,423
[SPEAKER_06]: The kiosks, they have to be dug out by our people?

1311
01:42:11,443 --> 01:42:13,784
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they don't make enough money, they're going to punish the city?

1312
01:42:14,824 --> 01:42:15,544
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to pay them?

1313
01:42:17,005 --> 01:42:18,325
[SPEAKER_06]: What the heck's going on here?

1314
01:42:21,166 --> 01:42:22,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I was living in Medford, Mass.

1315
01:42:22,986 --> 01:42:26,467
[SPEAKER_06]: USA, not in, you know, Nazi-ville somewhere.

1316
01:42:28,589 --> 01:42:37,233
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I fought for this country, and now I'm getting punished for it by these maggots that want to build a better house down in Atlanta, Georgia, wherever the Christ they come from.

1317
01:42:37,253 --> 01:42:37,293
[SPEAKER_06]: EC?

1318
01:42:37,493 --> 01:42:38,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Tennessee or whatever.

1319
01:42:38,913 --> 01:42:44,476
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, why are we taking the money out of the city and we're sending it down there?

1320
01:42:46,136 --> 01:42:53,980
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing before about the parking was to keep the money in the city, not give them 95% and keep 5%.

1321
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:57,061
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they don't make enough money, we've got to pay it.

1322
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:04,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Just not, let's just get the city solicitor to look at this problem and get rid of this monster.

1323
01:43:05,884 --> 01:43:08,205
[SPEAKER_06]: And get rid of that guy across the hall with him.

1324
01:43:09,586 --> 01:43:14,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Send the boat down to Tennessee where the hell the water be live down there with the alligators and everybody else down there.

1325
01:43:18,031 --> 01:43:20,472
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, another problem about safety.

1326
01:43:21,713 --> 01:43:22,894
[SPEAKER_06]: We having a big problem.

1327
01:43:23,054 --> 01:43:26,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I took a dive the other day walking around a car that was blocking the sidewalk.

1328
01:43:26,969 --> 01:43:31,373
[SPEAKER_10]: With all due respects, we are on the subject of the parking.

1329
01:43:31,513 --> 01:43:31,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1330
01:43:32,094 --> 01:43:32,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1331
01:43:32,574 --> 01:43:34,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll come back to that later on if I may.

1332
01:43:34,436 --> 01:43:38,539
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of approval by Councilor Penta, all those in favor.

1333
01:43:46,526 --> 01:43:48,108
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Penta.

1334
01:44:10,083 --> 01:44:17,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you forward those litany of complaints to the clerk so that he can attach them to the report to the mayor?

1335
01:44:17,687 --> 01:44:19,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, Counselor Camuso.

1336
01:44:19,648 --> 01:44:23,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we also ask that the city administration to provide with this data

1337
01:44:23,767 --> 01:44:29,890
[SPEAKER_11]: the amount of snow emergency days that were called since this program started?

1338
01:44:30,431 --> 01:44:30,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1339
01:44:30,531 --> 01:44:36,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Because those particular days, there was no parking on the main streets, legally.

1340
01:44:36,754 --> 01:44:42,977
[SPEAKER_11]: But we have a snow emergency like no other community that I've ever seen where you just keep it on and on and on with no enforcement.

1341
01:44:43,157 --> 01:44:45,078
[SPEAKER_11]: But if we could just ask that question.

1342
01:44:45,839 --> 01:44:46,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councillor.

1343
01:44:46,479 --> 01:44:47,460
[SPEAKER_10]: He wants a roll call.

1344
01:44:49,381 --> 01:44:51,742
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1345
01:44:52,482 --> 01:44:53,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Councillor Camuso.

1346
01:44:53,423 --> 01:44:53,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1347
01:44:54,237 --> 01:44:55,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caviello?

1348
01:44:55,238 --> 01:44:55,438
Yes.

1349
01:44:56,079 --> 01:44:56,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

1350
01:44:56,739 --> 01:44:56,939
