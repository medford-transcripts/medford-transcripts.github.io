On the agenda today, we have a review of the English language arts curriculum in the Medford public schools, humanities director, Dr. Nicole Piazza.

17
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:29,072
Superintendent, do you want to say anything before we begin?

18
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:32,660
Yes, good afternoon.

19
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:47,672
I am really pleased to have this opportunity with Dr. Chiesa to present all of the wonderful programming that is happening under ELA and the proposed plans for things, next steps

20
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,675
that we're thinking about for next school year.

21
00:02:51,555 --> 00:03:02,403
There's a lot of information in today's presentation, but I hope that it will be able to answer a lot of questions and concerns that members of the community might have.

22
00:03:02,543 --> 00:03:10,148
So I would like to pass it on to Dr. Chiesa for her to present to the committee this afternoon.

23
00:03:10,288 --> 00:03:10,628
Thank you.

24
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:11,389
Great.

25
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:14,191
Thanks, Maurice and Dr. Chiesa.

26
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:16,452
Thank you.

27
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:17,073
So I

28
00:03:17,852 --> 00:03:19,073
believe you may have the presentation.

29
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:21,033
I'm going to share my screen if that's okay.

30
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:21,894
Great.

31
00:03:21,914 --> 00:03:22,914
Can everybody hear me?

32
00:03:23,014 --> 00:03:23,314
Okay.

33
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:25,475
Awesome.

34
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:25,896
Thank you.

35
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:26,876
Okay.

36
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:29,797
Okay.

37
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:31,358
So let me just do.

38
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:37,220
All right.

39
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:38,001
Wrong slide.

40
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:38,321
Sorry.

41
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:40,082
Got to go to the beginning.

42
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:40,602
Excuse me.

43
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:43,982
I didn't think you were hitting us with the price points first, Nicole.

44
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:45,123
No, I know, right?

45
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,044
I was saving that for the last.

46
00:03:47,064 --> 00:03:47,864
So sorry.

47
00:03:48,484 --> 00:03:50,165
I have a nice presentation slide.

48
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:53,747
Thank you so much for the opportunity to be here today.

49
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,908
I really appreciate the time.

50
00:03:55,928 --> 00:04:01,910
I know there's a lot going on, and I appreciate the dedication to English language arts.

51
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,691
I'm hoping you can see my screen now.

52
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:06,793
And does the view look OK for you?

53
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:07,473
Yes.

54
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:16,056
So I'm going to go quickly through the presentation because I want to make sure that you all have time to have the questions answered.

55
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:20,260
And I don't know, of course, interject as you see fit.

56
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,302
However, you want to move forward with it is fine with me.

57
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:26,305
I'm going to briefly look at the state expectations.

58
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:32,431
I'm going to then go into all of the hard work that we've been doing in English language arts from the curriculum, the PD.

59
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:36,834
and the resources that we use and a lot that we have added this year.

60
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:42,496
I'm going to touch upon equity and ELA because that's been a very important goal for us this school year.

61
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,997
And then we will look at goals and next steps.

62
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:48,078
And part of that will be those price points that popped up.

63
00:04:49,078 --> 00:05:02,182
So very, very briefly, I include this slide only because I want the committee to understand that not only are we following the English language arts framework, but we also have

64
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:09,257
three other important resources that the state expects us to align towards.

65
00:05:10,317 --> 00:05:13,480
The first is the mass literacy guidelines.

66
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,743
This is a new set of guidelines that was established this school year.

67
00:05:18,043 --> 00:05:21,626
It had been in the works for a few years and it came out this school year.

68
00:05:21,746 --> 00:05:23,368
And I will talk about it in just a moment.

69
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:29,712
In addition to that, we also have the early literacy screener guidelines, which you are familiar with.

70
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,332
that is something that we are working with for our K through two learners.

71
00:05:34,552 --> 00:05:44,136
And in addition to that, there are numerous literacy grants, including MTSS grants, product grants that are ongoing.

72
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:55,881
So I include this diagram to show you that there are other influences to the ELA frameworks that my department looks very closely at and works with very closely.

73
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:59,743
I can't switch to the next slide.

74
00:06:01,003 --> 00:06:16,133
So when we think about just the English language arts framework itself, it's very important to recognize that we have not just reading standards, but we have writing standards, speaking and listening standards, and language standards.

75
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:23,618
They're nearly the same type of standards, K through five and six through 12, except that K through five

76
00:06:24,065 --> 00:06:28,087
we do have something called reading standards for foundational skills.

77
00:06:28,147 --> 00:06:35,911
So that is an extra anchor standard that we do utilize, that we must follow for elementary education.

78
00:06:37,892 --> 00:06:39,993
This is a little bit more about mass literacy.

79
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:43,495
It's a comprehensive guide.

80
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:50,478
It's devoted to high quality core instruction and evidence-based early literacy.

81
00:06:50,838 --> 00:06:52,279
It takes the science of reading

82
00:06:53,150 --> 00:07:03,252
and provides educators with a lot of different resources to support those evidence-based instruction for early literacy following the science of reading.

83
00:07:03,772 --> 00:07:08,513
And there's numerous schools that are included in this guide.

84
00:07:08,673 --> 00:07:10,833
This guide is very comprehensive.

85
00:07:11,793 --> 00:07:17,894
It takes up multiple, has different multiple pages within the DESE website itself.

86
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:22,495
But in essence, it's looking at providing information and guidance

87
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:25,566
on literacy acquisition and instruction.

88
00:07:26,086 --> 00:07:44,219
It's looking at those evidence-based literacy practices and it's compiling quality instructional resources, which is really helpful to us as we navigate as a school on the science of reading because more and more over the next several years, more and more resources will become available.

89
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:48,482
And the third piece,

90
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:53,423
when we think about just state expectations is that early literacy screener.

91
00:07:53,923 --> 00:07:56,924
This slide was presented just last week as well.

92
00:07:57,445 --> 00:08:00,346
This is where we took that early literacy screener.

93
00:08:00,366 --> 00:08:12,151
It walks you through the history, which was, as you know, we had back in 2018, Governor Baker signing a law into practice to develop screening procedures for dyslexia.

94
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:18,414
And then in 2019, 89 people were selected to represent states districts.

95
00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:26,077
And presently, we are still awaiting those final guidelines for an early literacy screener.

96
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:30,999
So we know that the department has issued a draft.

97
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:40,022
It is being reviewed by stakeholders, but we are still in a little bit of a holding pattern because we don't have the specific guidelines that the state has set.

98
00:08:40,713 --> 00:08:48,723
That will essentially tell us this is exactly what you need to look at when you before you finalize an early literacy screener.

99
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:51,967
Before I move on.

100
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:57,162
to the meat of the presentation, the district's resources.

101
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:58,963
Are there any questions I can answer?

102
00:08:58,983 --> 00:08:59,043
Yes.

103
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:00,603
Yeah, thanks.

104
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:00,884
Sorry.

105
00:09:02,364 --> 00:09:19,310
I was just curious whether the district had a reaction to the draft guidelines and whether the district has submitted a public comment about the guidelines or sort of what your thinking is about what the guidelines are saying versus what you,

106
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,256
would have expected them to say or would desire them to say?

107
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:28,897
I have not seen the specific guidelines.

108
00:09:28,977 --> 00:09:33,618
It went out to specific stakeholders and I was not, Medford was not one of them.

109
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:36,199
We're just getting bits of information.

110
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:38,080
So we haven't seen the final ones.

111
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:47,102
We have had some people involved in the process of development, but we haven't seen the draft yet.

112
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:48,083
Okay, awesome.

113
00:09:48,403 --> 00:09:52,104
I think we have a good sense of what it's gonna be like, but we don't have the draft yet.

114
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:59,910
Are there any other questions on this visual of the state expectations before I move on?

115
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:06,414
Okay.

116
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:20,503
So in response to all of the issues, not issues, sorry, in response to all of the state expectations, we have, the district has been working extremely hard

117
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:27,275
to partner, to make solid partnerships and provide some solid professional development to our teachers.

118
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:38,605
The goal of this PD is really to build capacity for our teachers in these shifts to evidence-based reading, science of reading and beyond.

119
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:44,530
At the secondary level, we've had a lot of shifts where we're looking at culturally responsive teaching,

120
00:10:45,202 --> 00:10:46,803
creating inclusive classrooms.

121
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:54,349
So this list gives you examples of some of the professional development that we have done this school year.

122
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:02,515
This school year, we've actually done all of this, this school year, and we had done it last school year as well.

123
00:11:02,935 --> 00:11:07,058
Some examples are we've worked very closely with the Hill for Literacy.

124
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:17,388
We've worked with them to bring in our enhanced core reading instruction, which is that new phonics or foundational skills program that we're offering to the K-2 students.

125
00:11:18,408 --> 00:11:25,809
They've also done professional development for us last year, specific to the science of reading for K-5 educators.

126
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:34,891
This year, we had Crafting Minds, which is Dr. Melissa Orkin and Dr. Elian come to Medford to present to our staff

127
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:59,585
more about the science of reading, specifically looking at when students hit those stumbling blocks, what are some ways that we can push through and better understanding those developmental stages of reading so that as we provide instruction and assessment, we are more educated in the path that we take.

128
00:12:00,746 --> 00:12:02,387
We've had training in Lexia Learning,

129
00:12:02,945 --> 00:12:05,427
We've had training in our early literacy screeners.

130
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:08,370
We've done a lot of work with Newsella.

131
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:17,979
Newsella started off as a social studies resource, and as it has grown, it has really grown to be a very solid literacy resource for us as well.

132
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:28,228
So as the secondary staff just the other day took a PD, they looked at looking at Newsella through culturally responsive teaching.

133
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:36,159
looking at different resources like A Mile in Our Shoes and Black Students Matter.

134
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:46,462
And we looked at what Moosella has to offer because we have that product and we want to make sure we're using it for all of these important topics.

135
00:12:46,902 --> 00:12:53,884
We've also done a lot of PD at the secondary level on creating an inclusive classroom, making sure that multiple voices are heard.

136
00:12:55,593 --> 00:13:07,136
And at the middle school level, we've also, in just a week, we're going to be doing training on Lexia Power Up, which we were recently able to purchase, which is very similar to Lexia Core 5.

137
00:13:07,256 --> 00:13:11,317
It's used as an intervention tool to support our readers.

138
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:20,059
And then we are hopeful before the end of the year to provide a mass literacy resource overview for our teachers.

139
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,860
You already know this information.

140
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,722
Very briefly, we have Alexia Rapid we're piloting at three of the schools, sorry.

141
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:37,443
And we have the MAP Growth we're piloting at the Columbus.

142
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:41,065
Both pilots continue to go well.

143
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:48,848
And again, we can't make an official determination of where we will end on an early literacy screener until we have those guidelines available.

144
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:56,734
Today, as I talk, I'm going to be looking at tier one and some of tier two for ELA.

145
00:13:56,834 --> 00:14:01,155
So I just wanted to include this visual as a guide some of my presentation.

146
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:09,877
I'm gonna delve more deeply into the elementary curriculum now, unless anybody has any questions before I continue on PD.

147
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:20,340
Okay, so I give you this visual to,

148
00:14:21,296 --> 00:14:29,258
show you that within the ELA framework, we have many different anchor standards that comprise it.

149
00:14:29,638 --> 00:14:30,699
We have speaking and listening.

150
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:32,639
We have language, which is grammar.

151
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:34,100
We have reading for literature.

152
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,120
We have writing.

153
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,901
We have reading for informational text.

154
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:40,362
And at the elementary level, we have reading for foundational skills.

155
00:14:42,202 --> 00:14:48,424
The elementary tier one instruction, so the instruction given to all students, is where we're following units for instruction

156
00:14:48,874 --> 00:14:51,015
based on a number of literacy resources.

157
00:14:51,776 --> 00:14:57,259
Each educator operates with a specific pacing guide that details each of these units.

158
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,405
And each unit is taking into account all of those different anchors within the curriculum.

159
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:14,490
Now, we use a lot of different resources to deliver the elementary curriculum.

160
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,672
And I think this is a point that I really wanna emphasize is

161
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:26,487
As you know, we've had journeys for a number of years, but we have also added in new resources.

162
00:15:26,607 --> 00:15:33,050
So we did see a deficit last year when we spoke with journeys specifically in the foundational skills area.

163
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:40,973
We were able to add in, thanks to the generosity of school committee and through some grants, working with Ms.

164
00:15:40,993 --> 00:15:46,175
Caldwell, we were able to add in the enhanced core reading instruction, which is called ECRATE.

165
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:47,556
This is an evidence-based

166
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:51,270
systematic reading instruction for teaching phonics.

167
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,313
That was new towards the end of last year, and it continues this year.

168
00:15:58,134 --> 00:16:04,659
We have had some intervention offered through MAP Growth that was new in 2019.

169
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,323
Lexia Learning was also introduced last school year.

170
00:16:12,464 --> 00:16:15,826
And Lexia Learning is more than just Lexia Rapid.

171
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:18,853
It is more than just Lexia Core 5.

172
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:23,181
Lexia Learning is constantly growing and we're growing with it.

173
00:16:23,702 --> 00:16:28,531
On March 2nd, we had a PD for our elementary teachers on Lexia Core 5.

174
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:35,087
and Lexia learning and what we're seeing with Lexia learning is it's taking other programs.

175
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:46,981
Some of you may be familiar with letters, and it's taking the letters program another intervention program and making it available on their digital platform so as they grow and expand.

176
00:16:47,742 --> 00:16:54,945
we're taking the time to understand that growth and find the best way to communicate these new tools with the teachers.

177
00:16:55,425 --> 00:17:03,908
So we've been very pleased with Lexia Learning beyond just Lexia Core 5, beyond just Lexia Rapid, to see what other interventions it has for our students.

178
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:09,050
Another thing that we have for our elementary students is Newzella.

179
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,691
Newzella is going to take articles

180
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:14,832
informational, some fictional.

181
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:29,121
Text has specific text sets and it takes those text sets and it changes the reading level so that the student can access the information, but at varying reading levels for the child.

182
00:17:30,222 --> 00:17:38,267
Students in the social studies classroom have been using that at the middle school for a number of years, but we found that our ELA teachers have been using it quite a bit

183
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:45,376
So we brought it down to our elementary for three, four, and five, and they have trained on that and are adjusting to that now.

184
00:17:45,997 --> 00:17:51,902
So it's another addition when I think of my tier one ELA curriculum resources, that is another addition to it.

185
00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:55,226
We also added this year Moby Read.

186
00:17:55,626 --> 00:18:02,933
Moby Read is an assessment tool, but also offers a digital library with decodable readers for students.

187
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:11,100
I also forgot to mention that Lexia Learning, just one of the new things they came out with was decodable readers for our K through three students.

188
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,481
So teachers are using that quite a bit as well.

189
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:21,967
We have reading A to Z, which if some of you have elementary students, you might be familiar with that as being called Raz Kids.

190
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:31,433
So we've been offering that for a number of years to our grade K through two, as well as to students that are in need

191
00:18:32,051 --> 00:18:34,512
of some additional reading support beyond grade two.

192
00:18:35,652 --> 00:18:37,433
And Moby Read appeared twice for some reason.

193
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:50,376
So that gives you a snapshot of just an understanding that we're constantly adding new programs, particularly now with this shift for the science of reading and evidence-based instruction.

194
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:53,657
We're trying to pull more in to better support our students.

195
00:18:56,862 --> 00:19:00,144
Other curriculum resources is something called ReadWorks.

196
00:19:00,904 --> 00:19:02,845
Zaner Blauser is used for writing.

197
00:19:04,285 --> 00:19:08,147
We do use classroom novels when we get to third, fourth, fifth grade.

198
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:20,513
We have audio books available for students, and we also have additional informational texts with a multicultural emphasis, as well as just an assortment of different excerpts from a variety of different resources.

199
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:32,769
When we think about tier two at the elementary, this is some of the classroom teachers.

200
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:35,831
The ones I have listed are a little bit more specific to the classroom teachers.

201
00:19:36,912 --> 00:19:39,994
So we have Houghton Mifflin for resources.

202
00:19:40,014 --> 00:19:42,275
We have Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Decoding Power.

203
00:19:42,775 --> 00:19:46,638
We have Lexia Core 5, which has an intervention and an enrichment component.

204
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:50,851
We have reading A to Z, which also has an intervention component.

205
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:56,655
So it's really, it moves back and forth as a tier one, but also a tier two intervention.

206
00:19:58,116 --> 00:20:02,499
ECRI has a tier one, but it also has a tier two.

207
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:08,123
So as we continue with our professional development, we're working hard to make sure our literacy specialists working with Ms.

208
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:15,708
Galussi on that to make sure that they are trained in the tier two offerings for ECRI as well as the classroom teachers.

209
00:20:16,404 --> 00:20:20,825
We have write-in readers and we have something called Houghton Mifflin Harcourt toolkits.

210
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:23,386
So these are all used at the tier two level.

211
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,807
The tier two is done during reading groups.

212
00:20:26,947 --> 00:20:28,547
It's done during wind blocks.

213
00:20:29,467 --> 00:20:35,829
And then of course we have our literacy specialists and our title one specialists that infuse other resources as well.

214
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:40,650
When we think about elementary accountability,

215
00:20:41,712 --> 00:20:45,435
I've just listed a variety of different assessments that students would look at.

216
00:20:45,595 --> 00:20:53,139
We have the early literacy screeners, running records, and mock assessments for MCAS as we get to the grades three through five level.

217
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:00,984
Before I move to secondary, I was wondering what questions I can answer for elementary.

218
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:06,688
Unless you prefer me to keep going and ask at the end, however you want to do it.

219
00:21:14,035 --> 00:21:24,534
I think I remember when we were looking at the budget last year, there was an ask from the elementary school principals around Zaner Blosser and an expansion of

220
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,665
material that my recall is did not get funded.

221
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:32,388
Is that true?

222
00:21:32,828 --> 00:21:41,537
Or I can't I'm trying to like recall off the top of my head the context, but I thought it was like an expansion to grade four, perhaps or something like that.

223
00:21:41,597 --> 00:21:43,880
So can you shed any light on that?

224
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,602
Yes, that's an excellent question.

225
00:21:45,662 --> 00:21:47,424
So I think Miss Glusi, my

226
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:55,685
she might need to chime in just a little bit as well, since she knows the details, but Zaner Blauser, they were trying to expand it into the upper grade levels.

227
00:21:55,805 --> 00:22:02,986
And also I believe that each principal asked for some additional consumables for all of the grade levels.

228
00:22:03,286 --> 00:22:10,548
And I don't think that was something that could, that the committee was able to provide last year.

229
00:22:10,668 --> 00:22:14,568
So, but I do, that request was in, you are correct.

230
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:14,849
Ms.

231
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:17,149
Galluzzi, did I misspeak or is that accurate?

232
00:22:21,442 --> 00:22:22,183
think she's muted.

233
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:29,688
Suzanne.

234
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:30,508
There we go.

235
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:31,549
Thank you.

236
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:32,330
I couldn't unmute.

237
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:36,292
No, that's I think in this COVID time, you're exactly right.

238
00:22:37,393 --> 00:22:43,257
It was something that the principals were working on in collaboration with Jan Hollenbeck, who's the director of

239
00:22:45,453 --> 00:22:51,397
Oh, she has a very long title, but she works, she also works with the OTs, so the occupational therapists.

240
00:22:51,557 --> 00:22:53,939
So part of that work was done in collaboration with her.

241
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:55,400
And yes, you are correct.

242
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,824
It would include a K to four focus with the printing, as well as the cursive writing.

243
00:23:01,204 --> 00:23:05,647
It was definitely put on hold due to COVID and the fact that a lot of it did involve consumables.

244
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:10,990
And with this year where some of us are in person and some of us are not, we just put it on hold for a little bit.

245
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:14,653
It's some conversation that we are going to be having.

246
00:23:15,752 --> 00:23:17,154
Yes, we have a, Ms.

247
00:23:17,174 --> 00:23:18,596
Hollenbeck has worked very hard on that.

248
00:23:18,656 --> 00:23:23,202
She formed a committee that I was part of with the principals to put these requests in.

249
00:23:23,563 --> 00:23:30,973
And also looking at some online resources as well, which sounds kind of funny when you think about handwriting, but they were actually pretty accessible too.

250
00:23:32,675 --> 00:23:32,936
Thank you.

251
00:23:35,867 --> 00:23:39,008
Should I continue to secondary and await questions?

252
00:23:39,428 --> 00:23:39,908
Paulette?

253
00:23:40,268 --> 00:23:40,468
Yes.

254
00:23:40,508 --> 00:23:42,869
I think there's a hand up.

255
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:43,669
Ms.

256
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:44,149
Hayes?

257
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,550
Yes, please.

258
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,850
Go ahead, Sharon.

259
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:51,091
Hi.

260
00:23:51,111 --> 00:23:58,234
I was wondering, could you explain what the ECRI is as an elementary school parent?

261
00:24:00,268 --> 00:24:11,293
I'm getting to see, of course, all the different materials and things that my first grader and third grader are using, and I'm not sure I know or would be able to recognize what kinds of materials might be related to that.

262
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,054
Could you describe that just a little bit?

263
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:14,655
Absolutely.

264
00:24:14,735 --> 00:24:24,320
So a lot of what ECRI, so Enhanced Core Reading Instruction, or ECRI, is targeting those foundational skills like the phonics, phonemic awareness,

265
00:24:25,405 --> 00:24:30,829
that we did see somewhat of a deficit in when we were looking at our data.

266
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:33,070
And so the way you might see it, Ms.

267
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:38,253
Hayes, is it's a lot of it is in how the teacher presents it.

268
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:53,282
So they are taking the foundational skills piece of journeys, the top layer, and they're delving more deeply into it through whole group instruction.

269
00:24:54,574 --> 00:24:59,740
And so you won't see like a handout, like a piece of paper that the child will fill out.

270
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,803
The teacher is doing it more of a whole group.

271
00:25:03,204 --> 00:25:13,576
If there wasn't COVID, it would be on the screen and then they would be, you know, going over the different sounds, for example, in a very explicit fashion.

272
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:26,712
One thing we do know is bringing this program in during a COVID year has been difficult, so we may not be seeing it quite as much as we would like to see it this school year.

273
00:25:27,212 --> 00:25:35,279
But we did train in the fall on this, and we do have training planned more for the teachers as they execute it.

274
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:36,520
But you're going to see it more as whole group.

275
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,362
Now, if the child is struggling in, let's say, phonemic awareness,

276
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:50,846
then during a wind block or a reading, like a small group reading, the teacher will pull tier two materials once as they acclimate to it to do a little more direct instruction.

277
00:25:53,109 --> 00:25:54,210
Does that answer your question?

278
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,752
Sharon, go ahead.

279
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:01,603
Thanks.

280
00:26:02,043 --> 00:26:07,426
So, um, maybe you're going to get into this later so feel free to say that if that's the case.

281
00:26:08,607 --> 00:26:18,471
One of the things that that particularly strikes me as I look at both of both of my sons learning to read and they are both, you know, fine readers they certainly don't have any issues.

282
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:33,712
But I look at the, the sequence that journeys and I believe that I've been a part of some of these meetings before I brought this up the sequence in which the phonics is taught, and you know that the various.

283
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:40,234
I mean, all different part, syllables, I don't really get into the syllable types.

284
00:26:40,254 --> 00:26:42,355
It doesn't really get much into syllable division.

285
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:46,077
I mean, all of these things that even my first grader could be using right now.

286
00:26:46,877 --> 00:26:49,739
And my third grader really isn't even being taught those.

287
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:53,981
And that's a huge, huge gap in our reading.

288
00:26:55,202 --> 00:26:59,704
And so I'm wondering what's kind of what the plan is for that.

289
00:26:59,764 --> 00:27:05,107
I know at some point there had been discussion of some of the teachers were going to go do an Orton Gillingham

290
00:27:06,605 --> 00:27:08,187
course, I think it was a free course.

291
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:11,350
I don't know what happened with that or if I'm remembering that wrong.

292
00:27:12,071 --> 00:27:17,657
But even I was thinking to myself, even if they got that, it does not match at all with what's being taught through the journeys.

293
00:27:18,217 --> 00:27:20,480
The journeys program really is not at all good.

294
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:21,930
with that piece.

295
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:29,855
And I know we were trying to, it feels like we're building in all these other little chunks here and there, but it doesn't feel like a cohesive whole to me.

296
00:27:29,895 --> 00:27:32,236
And I'm wondering how that's going to be addressed.

297
00:27:32,296 --> 00:27:35,778
I mean, the Lexia is great, but the kids go on it and play.

298
00:27:35,878 --> 00:27:42,021
And I have yet to see that kind of brought back into the classroom in terms of being followed through with in the classroom.

299
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:44,943
So that's, that is.

300
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,652
But that's my main concern.

301
00:27:47,752 --> 00:27:54,098
I see a real lack of word attack skills on my kids' part when they come to any kind of a multi-syllable word in a book.

302
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:00,224
Unless I've taught them myself with my own Wilson materials at home, they don't know.

303
00:28:03,067 --> 00:28:07,632
Right, so I can answer a little bit of that and I think I will probably

304
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:10,589
Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off, did I?

305
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,431
Nope, nope, go ahead.

306
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:18,636
Okay, I can answer a little bit of that right now and then I will probably go into, I think I go into more depth a little bit later on it.

307
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:26,001
So journeys is definitely not going to follow the OG or the Wilson reading because that's more of the targeted intervention.

308
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,403
If we think about just ECRI for a moment though,

309
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:37,012
ECRI is taking the breadth of Journey's foundational skills, like the overarching pieces, and pulling out the depth.

310
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:46,081
So you're going to see the child engage more systematically in those lessons, in those multi-syllabic words, for example.

311
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:50,245
They're gonna delve more deeply into those pieces.

312
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:53,088
The good thing with ECRI, though, is that

313
00:28:53,585 --> 00:29:04,557
It isn't just specific to journeys it's it's specific to multiple programs and a big piece of it is that explicit instruction that we did feel was missing.

314
00:29:05,998 --> 00:29:08,862
In the journeys program with that with that.

315
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,906
content you're speaking up, so I do agree, we needed.

316
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:18,504
more with it, it systematically follows it, but as we adjust, we'll see it more.

317
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,827
So I am going to, I think I do touch upon that a little bit later.

318
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:22,607
Okay.

319
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:26,731
But just, can I just quickly say, I understand of delving deeper.

320
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:30,954
The problem though, is that the journeys isn't getting to that.

321
00:29:31,054 --> 00:29:35,798
So the teachers can't delve in deeper into something that's not being taught in journeys.

322
00:29:36,138 --> 00:29:40,642
If the point of the ECRI is to delve deeper into what they're already teaching,

323
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:49,295
I looked through the scope and sequence of the journeys program, and they don't even begin to touch on syllables and things until third grade.

324
00:29:49,335 --> 00:29:52,978
And I mean, I know this is an off year, so I'll third grade until they do it.

325
00:29:53,838 --> 00:29:57,180
But they haven't touched on it with my son yet in third grade either.

326
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:02,023
So teachers can't delve into something that's deeper and something that's not being taught at all.

327
00:30:03,984 --> 00:30:04,804
You're absolutely right.

328
00:30:04,824 --> 00:30:11,068
And Akari is going to push some of those examples you just mentioned forward in earlier grades.

329
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:37,280
Okay, and is there going to be material, I guess, so I'm sorry, I won't keep going because you may be getting into this, but I mean, I look at the journeys program, how can they use the journeys program and delve deeper into things that aren't even touched in the journeys program, they would need additional materials, additional books, a lot of additional stuff to supplement if they're going to be teaching things that the journeys program doesn't even touch on.

330
00:30:42,827 --> 00:30:50,112
Yes, and ECRI will do some of that, but we definitely, the use of the decodable readers is a piece of it as well.

331
00:30:51,273 --> 00:30:56,537
But I think I may hit that a little bit later, but if I don't, I'm happy to circle back to that question.

332
00:30:56,557 --> 00:30:57,798
Okay, thank you.

333
00:30:58,718 --> 00:31:00,019
Thank you so much for your feedback.

334
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:00,760
I appreciate it.

335
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:04,489
Dr. Chiesa, I see that we have one more hand raised.

336
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:12,035
I'm gonna ask Maureen if you could keep it pretty short, because we need to get to the end of the presentation and then reflect back.

337
00:31:12,135 --> 00:31:13,456
So Maureen, go ahead.

338
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,922
Maureen, can you unmute yourself?

339
00:31:21,002 --> 00:31:22,883
It wouldn't let me unmute, but I've now unmuted.

340
00:31:23,143 --> 00:31:23,564
Okay, thank you.

341
00:31:24,297 --> 00:31:24,957
I'll make it quick.

342
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:36,465
We are using Journeys, like a reading program, Journeys and Fountas and Pinnell that are not evidence-based, and they're banned in several states, most recently Colorado.

343
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:39,347
A patch like ECRI isn't going to fix it.

344
00:31:39,787 --> 00:31:49,274
So is there like a movement to actually get an evidence-based core program so our kids will be taught to read in general ed?

345
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:55,043
Yes, I'm gonna go to that slide a little bit further in the presentation.

346
00:31:55,183 --> 00:32:00,251
Is it okay if I talk about secondary and jump back to that or would you guys prefer I go to that first?

347
00:32:01,313 --> 00:32:02,555
Yeah.

348
00:32:05,913 --> 00:32:14,738
Yeah, I would like to just request that Dr. Chiesa be allowed just to present the content of secondary as well.

349
00:32:15,338 --> 00:32:21,362
And then when she gets to what the next steps, I believe Ms.

350
00:32:21,382 --> 00:32:23,103
Ronayne, some of your questions and Ms.

351
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:26,525
Hayes will be answered at that point in time.

352
00:32:29,286 --> 00:32:31,608
Okay, so Dr. Chiesa, if you could continue please.

353
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,139
Okay, thank you so much.

354
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:41,422
So as we move from K through five to six through 12, we come to the ELA secondary curriculum resources.

355
00:32:42,342 --> 00:32:44,663
And next slide.

356
00:32:45,123 --> 00:32:54,646
So once again, we have this visual and the only thing that's different is that in six through 12, we do not have the reading for foundational skills anchor standard.

357
00:32:56,587 --> 00:32:58,128
In Medford six through 12,

358
00:33:00,101 --> 00:33:03,763
we approach the instruction through thematic units.

359
00:33:04,424 --> 00:33:08,806
So we do have all of those different standards in that visual I just shared.

360
00:33:11,988 --> 00:33:12,969
Sorry, I just heard an echo.

361
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:20,353
And in the visual, you will see that we have these different units for ELA instruction six through 12.

362
00:33:20,773 --> 00:33:29,298
So if you have a seventh grader, they have a social commentary unit, literary analysis, literary heritage, cultural perspectives, art of voice, language of literature,

363
00:33:29,768 --> 00:33:30,769
and literary movement.

364
00:33:31,149 --> 00:33:43,575
Essentially, as you may have heard me say before, English instruction is no longer, my unit is no longer, you know, Esperanza Rising, right?

365
00:33:43,595 --> 00:33:44,535
They read that in sixth grade.

366
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,316
The unit is not Esperanza Rising.

367
00:33:46,576 --> 00:33:56,301
The unit might be social commentary and we're going to infuse different books, both fictional and informational within that social commentary unit.

368
00:33:57,062 --> 00:33:59,423
So each unit is extremely comprehensive

369
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,091
and it includes all of the standards.

370
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:09,155
It includes the reading for informational, reading for fictional, language, writing, speaking, and listening.

371
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:17,339
When we think about writing, for each unit, the student is engaging in several genres of writing.

372
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:26,483
So if I'm in my Esperanza Rising, if I'm working with Esperanza Rising, and I'm within my social commentary unit,

373
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:28,606
I'm going to be doing narrative writing.

374
00:34:28,846 --> 00:34:30,607
I'm going to be doing expository writing.

375
00:34:30,787 --> 00:34:36,129
I'm going to be doing analytical writing on more, you know, a smaller scale.

376
00:34:36,729 --> 00:34:42,972
And then we do have one specific focus, one writing genre, main one for each unit.

377
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:50,595
So the six through 12 teachers follow a writing sequence where they know each unit they are using multiple genres of writing.

378
00:34:51,396 --> 00:34:57,559
but they will zone in on one particular genre to really emphasize as they move from unit to unit.

379
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:06,084
These units are consistently changed, altered, updated as we grow as a department.

380
00:35:06,664 --> 00:35:10,986
Similarly for each unit, variety of reading genres will appear.

381
00:35:11,187 --> 00:35:17,490
You will have a novel, you will have excerpts, you will have fictional stories, informational texts,

382
00:35:18,055 --> 00:35:23,076
And we have really worked as a department very closely to make sure that we're infusing diverse voices.

383
00:35:23,136 --> 00:35:27,337
That's been a primary goal of the department over the last several years.

384
00:35:28,197 --> 00:35:34,859
Each educator operates with a specific pacing guide that includes each of these units and has a specific writing sequence.

385
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:41,740
When we look at tier two for ELA, we have some options.

386
00:35:42,483 --> 00:35:44,244
when we look at intervention.

387
00:35:44,344 --> 00:35:49,766
And I know that this question arose at last week's meeting as well at the middle school level.

388
00:35:49,926 --> 00:35:55,348
So at the middle school level, they do have a wind block where they do a variety of different things.

389
00:35:55,688 --> 00:36:04,832
I know that the schools are cultivating school culture and community, and then the wind block will sometimes allow for intervention.

390
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:09,594
So the wind block can be used for what I need at times within the middle school.

391
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:15,870
At times, teachers can use the double block to do some of that tier two needs.

392
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:24,254
And we do have Lexia power up very recently for our sixth and seventh grade students.

393
00:36:24,494 --> 00:36:26,195
So we're rolling that out.

394
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:34,640
If you have a sixth or seventh grade child, they will have access very shortly to that if they're not already on.

395
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,682
At the high school level, we also really value

396
00:36:39,379 --> 00:36:42,421
intervention for our English learners.

397
00:36:43,622 --> 00:36:48,244
And so we have literacy challenge classes, and we also have MCAS challenge classes.

398
00:36:48,605 --> 00:36:52,827
Those are minis, those are electives that meet two out of the six day cycle.

399
00:36:56,509 --> 00:37:00,852
There is a variety of different assessments and accountability pieces for grades six through 12.

400
00:37:00,892 --> 00:37:09,057
These include beginning of the year assessments, the Lexia Power Up assessment is going to be very similar to Lexia Core 5, where it takes

401
00:37:09,495 --> 00:37:15,841
gives a quick assessment and then allows you to place the student where their intervention needs are.

402
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,562
We have unit assessments.

403
00:37:17,682 --> 00:37:23,227
We have mock MCAS assessments geared more at reducing test anxiety than anything else.

404
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:28,492
And then of course, students take the ELA MCAS grades six through eight and grade 10.

405
00:37:29,152 --> 00:37:30,814
And we have advanced placement exams.

406
00:37:31,234 --> 00:37:36,419
We offer AP courses for English in grades 11 and 12 at the high school level.

407
00:37:40,193 --> 00:37:48,036
When we look at a very, very important goal for the English language arts department, it's equity and ELA.

408
00:37:48,136 --> 00:37:57,599
I wanted this to be its own slide to share with you that over the past several years, we've been adding in numerous novels, numerous excerpts, numerous texts by diverse authors.

409
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:01,721
We've done a lot of PD on creating an inclusive classroom and we need to do more.

410
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:07,983
So we're gonna continue to do more as we have time with our teachers and within our pacing guides that we all follow,

411
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:17,373
We have made a concerted effort to make sure that it is visible, that the inclusivity is visible within our pacing guides.

412
00:38:17,973 --> 00:38:20,794
The addition of Newsella has been very helpful with that.

413
00:38:20,894 --> 00:38:23,755
Teachers just last week were trained with the identity wheel.

414
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:32,178
They explored a variety of different resources in Newsella, including A Mile in Our Shoes collection, Black Students Matter collection.

415
00:38:32,937 --> 00:38:35,219
and the mirrors and windows collection.

416
00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:39,441
So we're constantly looking for resources to best support our students.

417
00:38:42,023 --> 00:38:47,867
When we look at goals and next steps, there's a lot of goals for English language arts, and these are a few of them.

418
00:38:48,347 --> 00:38:59,034
But if I really narrow it down, because we can't, obviously we have to have focus, building capacity in that science of reading and evidence-based instruction for our teachers is extremely important.

419
00:38:59,134 --> 00:38:59,995
I'm very grateful.

420
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:01,430
to Ms.

421
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:05,512
Galussi for all of her support with this, as well as Ms.

422
00:39:05,532 --> 00:39:06,112
Campbell and Ms.

423
00:39:06,132 --> 00:39:17,419
Champoli and Mrs. Bowen as well, for allowing me on March 2nd to have that time to work with Crafting Minds and beyond.

424
00:39:17,459 --> 00:39:20,301
We've done a lot of PG with that, and we certainly have more to do.

425
00:39:20,881 --> 00:39:23,583
Another goal is early literacy screener.

426
00:39:23,963 --> 00:39:29,987
Once we have the guidelines, we need to really zone in on what we want to select as the best choice for our students.

427
00:39:31,062 --> 00:39:33,043
Intervention is a huge piece.

428
00:39:34,063 --> 00:39:48,647
Beyond just our tier one journeys program or ECRI, we really need to look at what are we using for programs for the students where they need something else, something more personalized to support their reading goals.

429
00:39:49,608 --> 00:40:00,291
And we will continue to look for new resources to support ELA instruction, as well as focusing in on that equity and inclusivity for our K through five students.

430
00:40:02,507 --> 00:40:09,089
So when we look at our goals, we do know that some of the next steps need to be to educate the staff on the mass literacy guidelines.

431
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:19,272
The Department of Education has provided us with a presentation to accomplish this, and we're hoping to also bring in somebody from DESE to present if they can.

432
00:40:19,892 --> 00:40:27,815
We are going to continue, of course, our literacy partnerships, which are just so valuable as we share in this endeavor.

433
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:36,070
And we are going to continue and increase our PD on evidence-based instruction, something we have done in the past few years, but we'll continue to do more of.

434
00:40:36,891 --> 00:40:39,412
We need to review those early literacy guidelines once available.

435
00:40:39,572 --> 00:40:53,800
And as I already said, we need to recommend an early literacy screener to the school committee once we have those guidelines available and we've done a solid review of the different tools that are available to us.

436
00:40:56,042 --> 00:41:15,515
We also need to cultivate additional programs to support the science of reading, such as ECRI, such as Lexia Learning, which, as I mentioned, has that letters program now, which can be very valuable to students that are struggling in reading, such as NewZella and other programs and different trainings, which Ms.

437
00:41:15,555 --> 00:41:20,859
Hayes mentioned, and a variety of different resources that are available.

438
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:23,621
So we need to continue to cultivate that and work together.

439
00:41:24,546 --> 00:41:42,260
to provide those additional programs so that we can personalize instruction to our students and continuing to incorporate equity and learn it in reading and continuing as a district to work on our literacy plan now that the math literacy guidelines have been outlined.

440
00:41:44,081 --> 00:41:51,027
This is a busy slide, but essentially this answers, this speaks to Ms.

441
00:41:52,087 --> 00:41:54,227
Ronayne's question a little bit more.

442
00:41:54,427 --> 00:42:13,551
So we do know that we want to update our literacy program, our core program, but I do think it's really important for us to realize that our core program needs to, as we update our core program, we're looking at, we need to continue to enhance the yellow cubes below.

443
00:42:14,151 --> 00:42:20,132
Our plan is to continue to build educator capacity on the science of reading and evidence-based instruction.

444
00:42:20,774 --> 00:42:31,181
Without that capacity, a pilot of a reading program is not going to be a solid because we need the teachers to continue to work.

445
00:42:31,221 --> 00:42:32,062
They've worked very hard.

446
00:42:32,102 --> 00:42:36,945
They're very knowledgeable, but we need them to better understand the mass literacy guidelines, which were just released.

447
00:42:37,065 --> 00:42:43,690
And we need them to foster more work with ECRI, given that this just rolled out during the COVID year.

448
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:57,706
This spring, I am going to form and foster a reading program committee where we will begin to look at the different programs, reading tier one programs that are available as a whole.

449
00:42:58,247 --> 00:43:07,592
I certainly am knowledgeable of them, but I want to form and foster that committee so that we can begin to look at the different programs that best meet the needs of our Medford students.

450
00:43:08,353 --> 00:43:11,675
Working with the reading committee, we will review a variety of new programs

451
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:15,091
We will then narrow it down to pilot two programs.

452
00:43:15,992 --> 00:43:32,379
And with school committee support, we will, once we do a proper pilot and we, you know, go through the sequencing for choice, we would then come to the school committee with a recommendation of a new reading program.

453
00:43:32,939 --> 00:43:42,083
So these arrows are the process, keeping in mind that as we work with that process, we are continuing to enhance and utilize

454
00:43:42,635 --> 00:43:51,157
all the different tools below, the Alexia Learning, the Early Literacy Screener, the ECRI, the Enhanced Core Reading Instruction, as well as NewZella.

455
00:43:51,177 --> 00:44:06,782
And the two orange bubbles on the top just are also very important because we need to make sure we're updating our district literacy plan, and also that we have a really clear understanding of the Early Literacy Screening Guidelines.

456
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:09,819
Dr. Kayes, can I interrupt for just one second?

457
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,681
Could you be clear?

458
00:44:14,883 --> 00:44:22,388
You said that you would be recommending, at which point would you be recommending a new reading program date-wise?

459
00:44:23,628 --> 00:44:25,470
Is that in next spring?

460
00:44:27,091 --> 00:44:36,837
So we have to keep in mind, so spring 2021, form and fostering a reading program committee, working with the reading committee, we're gonna review new programs and

461
00:44:37,357 --> 00:44:41,999
The pilot is gonna be a little bit tricky with the year of COVID.

462
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:43,580
We've been pushed out a little bit.

463
00:44:44,541 --> 00:45:02,510
So including taking into account the fact that the teacher's capacity and the amount of PDs, it would be spring, by the end of, sorry, by the end of next spring, we would be selecting the two programs.

464
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,131
We would be piloting 22 to 23 coming to the committee

465
00:45:06,907 --> 00:45:09,848
in 23 for the recommendation for the following school year.

466
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:20,752
Our concern is that we know that we have other curriculum programs that are also in need and are in the midst of piloting.

467
00:45:20,932 --> 00:45:23,013
So we needed to take that into account.

468
00:45:23,673 --> 00:45:24,433
Dr. Vincent or Ms.

469
00:45:24,453 --> 00:45:28,655
Galluzzi, if I didn't explain that correctly, please feel free to let me know.

470
00:45:29,055 --> 00:45:32,556
Would every school have a pilot program?

471
00:45:34,877 --> 00:45:35,077
Yes.

472
00:45:35,636 --> 00:45:41,421
So when I piloted before, every school had the option to pilot a program.

473
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:47,026
We didn't turn anybody away and we included all four schools.

474
00:45:47,186 --> 00:45:58,996
And what we were left with was a majority of teachers were implementing that new programs earlier than the official adoption because we made sure to include multiple teachers.

475
00:45:59,036 --> 00:46:00,157
It wasn't a small pilot.

476
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:03,220
It was a big pilot that included K through five teachers.

477
00:46:04,978 --> 00:46:05,718
at all four schools.

478
00:46:06,538 --> 00:46:10,939
Right, and the goal would be to adopt the program K to five.

479
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:12,839
Yes.

480
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:24,482
Okay, I mean, I certainly understand that as a parent who might have a, you know, second grader, they're counting and saying, oh, that's not gonna be made it, you know, for two years.

481
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:25,782
Yes.

482
00:46:26,622 --> 00:46:31,983
I'm walking back a little bit and say, well, there'll be something tried in your school, but that's always the very hard part as our,

483
00:46:33,299 --> 00:46:36,341
as we look at rollouts for new curriculum.

484
00:46:37,121 --> 00:46:42,423
Dr. Edward-Vinson?

485
00:46:42,724 --> 00:46:55,429
In terms of the timetable, I just want to present the parallel timetable because Dr. Chiesa alluded to it, but just to give some greater specificity,

486
00:46:58,806 --> 00:47:16,578
At the elementary level, the math screening team is reconvening in the late spring, and so the top two of the five programs that were being screened

487
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:22,816
are going to be piloted in September of 21.

488
00:47:23,456 --> 00:47:27,981
So when we're thinking about a capacity and learning issue in September of this year, to

489
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:35,784
different math curriculum, they're going to be piloted throughout the district.

490
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:39,967
Teachers are going to need to receive that professional development.

491
00:47:40,988 --> 00:47:57,120
And once the piloting of the two programs is done, we're going to make a recommendation to the school committee, same time next year, so that in March of 22, the recommendation to the school committee would be to pick

492
00:47:58,801 --> 00:48:04,847
one of the two programs based on what was piloted district-wide.

493
00:48:05,447 --> 00:48:13,715
And so we would be essentially replicating that same exact process for ELA, but at least giving the

494
00:48:15,315 --> 00:48:28,953
the teachers an opportunity to be able to focus on piloting a curriculum at a time so that when they're implementing the new math curriculum, they'll be piloting the new literacy curriculum.

495
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,292
if that helps with the timetable.

496
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:54,844
Because to try to launch two totally different contents at the same exact time, you really need to give the educators an opportunity to be able to have that professional development, finish that process, and then restart it again with the next content area.

497
00:48:59,367 --> 00:48:59,647
OK.

498
00:49:00,648 --> 00:49:02,449
Dr. Chiesa, do you want to continue on?

499
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:05,150
Yes, thank you.

500
00:49:08,511 --> 00:49:11,172
At the secondary level, we have quite a few goals as well.

501
00:49:11,413 --> 00:49:17,675
We need to continue to look at providing equity and inclusivity within our curriculum.

502
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:21,656
We need to really continue to look at the digital resources.

503
00:49:22,357 --> 00:49:30,920
We have added some digital, of course, during COVID, we've added digital resources, but we found that a lot of the students are really able to access

504
00:49:31,546 --> 00:49:34,188
different texts a little bit more easily with our Sora OneDrive.

505
00:49:34,228 --> 00:49:35,869
So we wanna continue to develop that.

506
00:49:36,669 --> 00:49:41,112
Accessibility intervention is a huge one at the grade six through 12 level.

507
00:49:42,153 --> 00:49:54,440
We know that due to some funding, we weren't able to offer all of the interventions that we would obviously like to do at the middle school, but that doesn't mean that we stop.

508
00:49:54,841 --> 00:49:58,503
And we have certainly tried to be very creative

509
00:49:59,055 --> 00:50:03,276
in making sure that our tier two readers are supported.

510
00:50:03,816 --> 00:50:06,897
I'm thrilled that we were able to get Lexia Power Up.

511
00:50:07,977 --> 00:50:12,078
It was through some CARES Act funding and it was pretty recent.

512
00:50:12,938 --> 00:50:20,099
And I think it's gonna make a, I know it's gonna make a big difference for some of our struggling readers at the middle school level.

513
00:50:20,959 --> 00:50:23,020
And we need to continue to look at consistency.

514
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:28,501
Consistency has been very, very important for our teachers because

515
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:37,473
It then allows our special education and our EL teachers to follow our pacing in a different, in the way that works best for them.

516
00:50:37,553 --> 00:50:40,516
So we have really made sure that we're extremely consistent.

517
00:50:41,036 --> 00:50:47,202
In the past, when we've looked at our different units for six through 12, we've had to split them up.

518
00:50:47,743 --> 00:50:52,287
So because ELA is cyclical at six through 12, and you can hit different

519
00:50:53,038 --> 00:51:03,425
types of reading standards or writing standards, we were able to, maybe I would offer a social commentary unit and the other teacher was doing literary heritage.

520
00:51:04,046 --> 00:51:08,429
With the pandemic, we decided, and the reason for that was because then we could share texts.

521
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:16,294
So I could take the texts I needed for social commentary, and then I could give them to the other teacher when that teacher was on social commentary.

522
00:51:16,334 --> 00:51:18,896
It's not as chronological, obviously, like history.

523
00:51:19,717 --> 00:51:34,226
But what we did find this year with the pandemic is being consistent and having everybody on that same unit at the same time has been really helpful to our students and to our EL and special education population as well.

524
00:51:34,606 --> 00:51:37,968
We've also been able to add in some different texts for our readers.

525
00:51:38,288 --> 00:51:45,673
We may be reading one book and there may be a graphic novel option for the student that maybe would prefer that medium.

526
00:51:45,753 --> 00:51:49,235
So we've been really focusing on that accessibility piece as well.

527
00:51:49,796 --> 00:51:51,157
coupled with the consistency.

528
00:51:56,041 --> 00:52:04,908
For secondary next steps and goals, that mass literacy guidelines, those are still important to our teachers, even at the secondary level.

529
00:52:05,028 --> 00:52:10,653
The focus is a little bit more obviously early literacy, but it's still really important for our secondary teachers to know that.

530
00:52:11,113 --> 00:52:12,494
So we're continuing with that.

531
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:14,476
We're continuing with our literacy partnerships.

532
00:52:14,576 --> 00:52:17,358
I want to see those pushed more into secondary

533
00:52:18,313 --> 00:52:26,757
And certainly I want to continue with them at the elementary, but they're still very, very important for our readers, for our 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 readers.

534
00:52:26,797 --> 00:52:33,460
So I want to continue those partnerships and do more PD on literacy with our ELA teachers at the secondary level.

535
00:52:34,681 --> 00:52:42,464
Just very quickly, in the interest of time, I want to continue to cultivate those additional programs that support the students and also bring in that culturally responsive

536
00:52:42,972 --> 00:52:52,460
piece with Lexia learning to support the students and Nuzella as well as other resources as we continue on with our work.

537
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,242
Continue to add in additional supports as needed.

538
00:52:55,843 --> 00:53:00,126
And again, the literacy plan is something that's not just K through five, it's K through 12.

539
00:53:00,546 --> 00:53:04,369
So continuing to work on a literacy plan that integrates these guidelines.

540
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,532
This was the slide that popped up when we first began.

541
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:12,216
So these are just some examples of the investment thanks to the committee's generosity

542
00:53:13,173 --> 00:53:20,654
as well as a lot of funding through the CARES Act as well, where we've been able to invest a lot of money in literacy.

543
00:53:20,694 --> 00:53:22,975
So I appreciate the support.

544
00:53:23,115 --> 00:53:24,835
I really appreciate the questions too.

545
00:53:25,715 --> 00:53:30,536
I really am gonna be looking for your support as we continue through budget season.

546
00:53:31,056 --> 00:53:34,417
This just gives you an example of some of the price points.

547
00:53:34,517 --> 00:53:42,118
So if we look at SORA OneDrive, it's about a $3,000 investment for informational texts and literacy.

548
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:45,892
We do have replacement books that we often need.

549
00:53:46,012 --> 00:53:51,394
So those first three items are ones you pretty much see each year.

550
00:53:52,235 --> 00:54:05,261
These don't all come from the English Language Arts budget, but the Early Literacy Screener, for example, will definitely be a cost that will be appearing for this coming school year, 21-22.

551
00:54:05,422 --> 00:54:08,823
We think that will be around 5,000.

552
00:54:08,903 --> 00:54:12,145
We're using numbers based on this year to get there.

553
00:54:13,065 --> 00:54:15,767
The MobyDot Read is our digital library.

554
00:54:15,887 --> 00:54:18,428
That's about, that's $4 per student.

555
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:27,294
Musela at the elementary level is approximately $10,000, at the middle school, 15, and at the high school, 10.

556
00:54:27,854 --> 00:54:33,077
It's based on the number of students, so it does vary, but those are the ballpark figures.

557
00:54:34,018 --> 00:54:42,783
Lexia Core 5 was very generously funded through the CARES Act this year for our elementary students, and most recently for our middle school students.

558
00:54:43,271 --> 00:54:45,733
You can see that that is a hefty expense.

559
00:54:46,153 --> 00:54:55,801
That's something I'm going to ask for, because I just met with teachers today for two and three, and it really is something that's being utilized and allows for a little bit more of that personalization.

560
00:54:56,601 --> 00:55:03,086
We have reading A to Z, which we're offering right now for our K through two students, and that is around 9,300.

561
00:55:04,407 --> 00:55:07,950
We've put a lot of money in PD for literacy.

562
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:09,571
I want to do more next year.

563
00:55:09,651 --> 00:55:11,553
I want to continue the hill for

564
00:55:12,235 --> 00:55:18,218
literacy partnerships, Dr. Orkin, Dr. Illion, and that's just a few examples.

565
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:22,601
So time is always an issue, but certainly budget is.

566
00:55:22,881 --> 00:55:29,665
So I'm asking for an investment in that because I think it's an investment in our teachers' capacity and of course in our students.

567
00:55:30,205 --> 00:55:40,871
And then we also have our ThinkCentral learning platform as well that we will need to continue until we settle on a very big ticket item with a new reading program.

568
00:55:45,334 --> 00:55:47,335
I hope I allowed enough time for questions.

569
00:55:49,035 --> 00:55:51,796
Dr. Chiesa, thank you for your presentation.

570
00:55:52,516 --> 00:56:03,679
The first thing I'm going to ask you is for clarification, just so is the LexiaCorp V at 39,000, is that then would be a recurring yearly cost?

571
00:56:06,259 --> 00:56:08,660
And last year- Correct, that is correct.

572
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,961
Last year it came out of the CARES money and-

573
00:56:14,885 --> 00:56:15,245
Yeah, go ahead.

574
00:56:15,265 --> 00:56:16,826
This year, it came out of the CARES money.

575
00:56:17,386 --> 00:56:23,749
Last year, it was, yes, it was free through the company giving free resources.

576
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:25,190
This school year, it came out of the CARES Act.

577
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:33,094
So they give it to you once for free because, and then they hope you get 40,000 plus.

578
00:56:33,174 --> 00:56:42,138
We were using it for certain students K through two before COVID, and then they expanded it to include all students.

579
00:56:43,172 --> 00:56:49,638
We heard a lot of really good feedback, and so we did invest in it with the CARES Act funding.

580
00:56:50,378 --> 00:56:51,399
Okay.

581
00:56:51,859 --> 00:56:57,104
You know, I'm not saying we don't need it, and we certainly want the best for our students.

582
00:56:58,044 --> 00:57:03,048
It's just in terms of planning and knowing that that's a cost, it's significant.

583
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:04,349
It is.

584
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,051
It absolutely is.

585
00:57:06,351 --> 00:57:06,551
Yes.

586
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,453
I'd like to, first if, Suzanne?

587
00:57:10,616 --> 00:57:28,326
I just wanted to clarify one thing because I noticed we're like a little short on time and I just wanted to say, based on some of the questions that came up earlier, when Dr keys was mentioning equity and how we have that as part of the K to to supplement to the journeys program, I just wanted to say.

588
00:57:30,206 --> 00:57:37,348
In terms of the ECRI, just so people are clear, because I was part of that training as well.

589
00:57:37,728 --> 00:57:51,630
So, Hill for Literacy, when they do the training for us with ECRI, they provide the materials that the teachers need in order to help develop the phonological skills that we want to see in our students.

590
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:55,391
Yes, you use the Journeys Reading Program, but

591
00:57:56,231 --> 00:57:58,793
the materials are also supplied to the teachers.

592
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:05,139
They have exactly what they need in order to make sure that the program is being utilized.

593
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:21,813
And I hope that makes sense, but it just seemed like by one of the questions that parents were a little unclear thinking that the materials weren't there for the teachers in order to teach the skills to the students and they are provided.

594
00:58:23,158 --> 00:58:25,981
Okay, I see Jenny has her hand raised.

595
00:58:27,222 --> 00:58:28,263
Jenny, unmute, please.

596
00:58:30,565 --> 00:58:31,005
Thank you.

597
00:58:31,025 --> 00:58:33,827
I actually have several questions.

598
00:58:35,108 --> 00:58:45,357
When you were talking about the secondary level, you said something to the effect of not having enough

599
00:58:48,268 --> 00:58:58,390
resources and I use that term broadly to do what we would have needed to do at the middle school level.

600
00:58:59,311 --> 00:59:16,735
And I don't, I would like to encourage you to be unapologetically clear about what you need from the committee and the city

601
00:59:18,238 --> 00:59:24,341
in this upcoming budget, don't be unclear.

602
00:59:25,282 --> 00:59:30,004
If you need three teachers, please tell us that you need three teachers.

603
00:59:30,585 --> 00:59:39,650
If you need resources, like I remember distinctly that we hacked away a lot of online resources when we were making budget cuts last year.

604
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,632
And I remember feeling like,

605
00:59:44,935 --> 00:59:49,118
the people telling us they didn't need those things felt pretty uncomfortable because they know they did.

606
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:52,461
So I say all of this to say,

607
00:59:54,161 --> 01:00:01,804
We need you to tell us what you need to make sure that we don't have generations full of children who struggle to read.

608
01:00:02,464 --> 01:00:22,032
So whatever it is that you need, I wanna encourage you to be completely clear and like unabashedly transparent about what those things are so that we can never come back to you and say, you didn't tell us that you needed something.

609
01:00:23,313 --> 01:00:33,683
I want the city to and the school committee to make those prioritization decisions so that it's clear who is who is

610
01:00:37,622 --> 01:00:41,747
outlining what is needed and who is and isn't able to provide those things.

611
01:00:42,027 --> 01:00:54,081
So if that's resources at the middle school, if that's an assessment tool, if that's $40,000 for 2,000 kids, that is just not a lot of money in my mind in terms of what

612
01:00:55,217 --> 01:00:58,039
those tools can do if they are valuable and effective.

613
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:03,161
I'm not afraid to tell the city that we need more money.

614
01:01:03,181 --> 01:01:07,483
And I would think that my colleagues would generally feel the same way.

615
01:01:07,603 --> 01:01:17,468
So please be clear and transparent about that with us so that we can advocate for the students because that's why we all do this job.

616
01:01:17,488 --> 01:01:21,590
So definitely tell us what you need.

617
01:01:23,681 --> 01:01:24,862
Yep, I really appreciate that.

618
01:01:25,863 --> 01:01:47,259
And then I guess the other question that I had, I definitely sort of understand and appreciate the the stacking and the like the transition that has to happen to roll out new curricula and that you at the elementary school level in particular can't do that across multiple subject matters in the same year.

619
01:01:48,734 --> 01:01:56,180
But I would ask and challenge you all to think about whether there's a way to accelerate the process.

620
01:01:58,282 --> 01:02:05,407
Perhaps the math committee has a front runner, and if they're being honest, they know who they're going to pick.

621
01:02:06,392 --> 01:02:10,013
And maybe we just have to roll with that to expedite the whole process.

622
01:02:11,774 --> 01:02:22,997
If it means we need to find a way to negotiate more professional development time, please tell us that too, so that if there is any way possible

623
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:38,623
We can be in a position where we are rolling out a new literacy program before 2023 that we can do that like the kids who are going to be missed in the right now are also the kids.

624
01:02:39,364 --> 01:02:44,467
most dramatically impacted by the pandemic at that very young reader level.

625
01:02:45,148 --> 01:02:56,876
So between now and 2023 is like recovery time for all the things that they have missed and we've not been able to accomplish with them because of the pandemic.

626
01:02:57,456 --> 01:03:07,463
If we wait till 2023 to start using a curriculum that is suitable to our needs, like it's just gonna exacerbate that problem

627
01:03:08,677 --> 01:03:09,458
even more so.

628
01:03:09,798 --> 01:03:37,515
So if there's any creative out-of-the-box way for us to do all of this just a little bit faster, I think the kids, the littles in particular who are gonna be passed by while we wait for Medford to, and through no fault of really anybody on this phone call, to put in place curricula that are sound and evidence-based

629
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:43,718
and competitive, I guess I'll say, across all subject matters.

630
01:03:44,298 --> 01:03:55,465
It is a huge lift what you all are doing at the elementary school level to really write the curriculum across lots of different topics.

631
01:03:55,485 --> 01:04:04,870
In regular times, this probably couldn't be moving fast enough for some, but the literacy piece of this is so important.

632
01:04:06,612 --> 01:04:11,653
that I am really concerned about the impacts of the kids who we are going to leave behind.

633
01:04:12,093 --> 01:04:13,853
So just think about that.

634
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:21,155
And if there are ways the committee needs to prioritize and support those activities, I am all ears.

635
01:04:22,695 --> 01:04:23,415
I appreciate that.

636
01:04:23,715 --> 01:04:31,157
I will say, you know, at the middle school level, I don't think anybody was happy to see the literacy specialists, you know, not

637
01:04:31,641 --> 01:04:33,522
those positions no longer be available.

638
01:04:33,722 --> 01:04:44,628
And I do think it is very, very important that we do our best to bring the literacy specialists back to the middle school for next year.

639
01:04:44,969 --> 01:04:47,090
And when I say the specialists, just the tier two.

640
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:52,293
And I know that everybody fought really hard to try to keep that and it just couldn't happen this year.

641
01:04:52,433 --> 01:04:59,797
So I definitely think that's something we need to reconsider for the middle school as we move into a new budget year.

642
01:05:01,652 --> 01:05:06,937
And I think I just heard that there was some good news from Washington on the relief bill today.

643
01:05:07,077 --> 01:05:10,941
So get out your wish lists.

644
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:16,205
I see Susie your hand is raised.

645
01:05:19,308 --> 01:05:19,909
You're muted.

646
01:05:25,803 --> 01:05:37,430
Well, I just wanted to shed a little more light on ECRI, because before coming to Medford, I used to be a literacy interventionist, and I actually have taught ECRI.

647
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:41,633
And it is, it's really a great program.

648
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:43,494
It is evidence based, and

649
01:05:44,177 --> 01:05:48,459
Well, I taught it in an interventionist role.

650
01:05:49,099 --> 01:05:51,240
The teachers do get everything they need.

651
01:05:51,501 --> 01:06:03,286
And it is the University of Oregon who worked with ECRI with the Hill, they have built these materials to go with a bunch of different publishers.

652
01:06:03,927 --> 01:06:12,591
So even if you were to look at a different publisher for a text, it's very well, you could be also using ECRI with that.

653
01:06:13,248 --> 01:06:19,772
because they introduce the different phonics elements and they build on it day to day.

654
01:06:19,932 --> 01:06:25,656
And it's like, it's just an add-on that goes with the text and it's very systematic.

655
01:06:26,476 --> 01:06:32,240
The teachers really, they continue to use it even after the research study was over.

656
01:06:33,061 --> 01:06:34,722
And it's a really great program.

657
01:06:34,942 --> 01:06:42,827
So I just wanted to say the skills that you, that are taught in ECRI are also taught with other programs.

658
01:06:46,716 --> 01:06:47,217
Let's see.

659
01:06:47,677 --> 01:06:48,417
Thank you, Susie.

660
01:06:50,619 --> 01:06:52,100
Are there any other questions?

661
01:06:56,963 --> 01:06:57,463
Comments?

662
01:06:59,384 --> 01:07:00,885
Anybody want to add anything?

663
01:07:02,606 --> 01:07:05,348
Sharon Hayes, I see that you've got your hand raised.

664
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,264
Sharon, can you unmute?

665
01:07:09,064 --> 01:07:09,545
Hi, yes.

666
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:12,687
I'm curious, and I'll try to be quicker this time.

667
01:07:13,227 --> 01:07:20,072
So, I mean, I know that Telfer Literacy and Crafting Minds are both fantastic, fantastic resources.

668
01:07:20,851 --> 01:07:28,136
I also know they're very strong in systematic, explicit phonics instruction in terms of their belief in that and promotion of that.

669
01:07:28,617 --> 01:07:43,567
I'm curious as we talk about looking for new programs, are we talking once again about a program similar to journeys in terms of a full box set, supposedly having everything included, or are we looking at a more, you know,

670
01:07:45,518 --> 01:07:50,221
an additional, something like a foundation, some kind of additional explicit phonics?

671
01:07:50,321 --> 01:07:58,227
And are we getting recommendations from KILL and Crafting Minds, since they would definitely be good resources in that direction?

672
01:07:58,247 --> 01:08:00,569
Sorry, my video's off.

673
01:08:03,971 --> 01:08:08,474
Yes, so those are all thoughts that I've definitely been

674
01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:16,056
sorry, let me just put my earpiece back on, that I've definitely been thinking about, you know, will there be one, will it be one holistic program?

675
01:08:16,136 --> 01:08:20,240
Will it be something for our K through two, three through five that has a crossover?

676
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,582
Will it be something different?

677
01:08:22,602 --> 01:08:26,505
I think that that's something where the committee is really going to become important.

678
01:08:27,046 --> 01:08:32,611
We have been working very closely with Hill, developed really solid foundations with Hill and Dr. Orkin,

679
01:08:32,995 --> 01:08:36,977
and I hope very much, I'm already getting recommendations with them.

680
01:08:37,737 --> 01:08:41,598
Hill was actually the one that brought up ACRI last year to us.

681
01:08:41,778 --> 01:08:48,661
So it was through them that we really got to that systematic program.

682
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,842
So we absolutely will be working with Hill.

683
01:08:50,862 --> 01:08:52,322
I'm hopeful that we will pull them in.

684
01:08:52,723 --> 01:08:57,024
I'm gonna try to see if they can come and work with our committee.

685
01:08:57,044 --> 01:08:58,825
I haven't asked them yet, but it's certainly,

686
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:03,003
something that, you know, they are experts, they are leaders in the field.

687
01:09:03,163 --> 01:09:05,365
We've also worked really closely with Desi.

688
01:09:05,845 --> 01:09:06,045
Ms.

689
01:09:06,065 --> 01:09:12,850
Tarka has been wonderful in the humanities office to keep us moving along.

690
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:16,353
So certainly, I think beyond just

691
01:09:17,936 --> 01:09:20,679
This school, we have to build those partnerships.

692
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:23,041
We've seen so much come out of it already.

693
01:09:23,221 --> 01:09:35,254
So yes, we will be trying to engage them and to see if it's going to be a K through five holistic approach or something else is definitely something that's a big part of our conversations within the committee.

694
01:09:35,354 --> 01:09:36,655
Nothing has been decided on that.

695
01:09:37,491 --> 01:09:38,312
Okay, thank you.

696
01:09:39,873 --> 01:09:42,234
Dr. Chiesa, I'd like to just ask you one question.

697
01:09:42,254 --> 01:09:51,701
I know earlier this week, was it this week or last week, you had a meeting with the mayor.

698
01:09:52,201 --> 01:09:58,906
Yes, it was last week with the mayor and a group of parents who are very concerned about dyslexia in our system.

699
01:09:59,687 --> 01:10:06,011
Could you just tell us, just kind of sum up

700
01:10:06,662 --> 01:10:13,865
the sense of what we're doing and what their concerns are going forth.

701
01:10:14,305 --> 01:10:20,107
Do you think that the proposal is meeting the issues?

702
01:10:20,667 --> 01:10:27,070
Will our new pick be comprehensive for this dyslexic issue?

703
01:10:28,388 --> 01:10:30,829
Our new pick will be comprehensive for sure.

704
01:10:31,069 --> 01:10:34,670
Don't think it will be taking tier three at it.

705
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:38,831
You know, it won't have a Wilson component to it, right?

706
01:10:38,851 --> 01:10:41,811
That's its own program for some of our learners that need that.

707
01:10:42,311 --> 01:10:54,534
But certainly the special education and EL population are big voices when we select a program, 100%, excuse me.

708
01:10:54,675 --> 01:10:56,395
So all of our students,

709
01:10:57,690 --> 01:11:04,635
will be really important in picking the correct program for our children's needs, absolutely.

710
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:14,442
I need to make sure it has a solid intervention program, a solid tier one, the best defense to tier two is a good tier one.

711
01:11:14,643 --> 01:11:22,088
So we wanna make sure that we're there and we wanna make sure that all of our students' voices and needs are heard, including EL and special ed.

712
01:11:23,949 --> 01:11:24,790
And I, yeah.

713
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:25,891
Any other questions, Jenny?

714
01:11:29,192 --> 01:11:35,315
Um, that actually sorry, I forgot to ask this earlier because I was that was on my mind as well.

715
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:49,122
But when we talk about the work that you're doing, it's certainly as you mentioned, like doing a doing a focused job in tier one should help us avoid, um,

716
01:11:50,958 --> 01:11:59,322
kids having to move through to tier two or even on to tier three, because we didn't do the right things for them sort of at those foundational like levels.

717
01:12:00,503 --> 01:12:04,065
So I guess there's sort of two thoughts that I have as it relates to that one is.

718
01:12:05,526 --> 01:12:09,668
We did put on the list of standing reports for the school committee.

719
01:12:11,549 --> 01:12:20,734
a request that when assessments are given, we receive the aggregated results in some fashion.

720
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:33,080
And I know we didn't get that at all this year, but I think it is important for the committee to have a pulse of like, where are those assessments coming in on any given assessment?

721
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:34,621
I think you do three assessments a year.

722
01:12:36,221 --> 01:12:45,885
So I would want to be able to, I just wanted to bring that to your attention so that it's clear that that is on the list of approved reports, like under the reporting policy that we just passed.

723
01:12:47,585 --> 01:12:55,208
And if there's an opportunity, I don't know when the right time is to catch the committee up on those reports for this year, that would be great.

724
01:12:55,228 --> 01:12:59,110
But then- Okay, and I worked really closely with, sorry.

725
01:12:59,190 --> 01:12:59,750
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

726
01:13:00,618 --> 01:13:02,839
No, I was just going to say, I want to make sure that Ms.

727
01:13:02,859 --> 01:13:03,379
Glucy, Ms.

728
01:13:03,399 --> 01:13:03,900
Campbell, and Ms.

729
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:09,843
Ciampoli get a lot of credit for that as well, because we do work as a team to do that.

730
01:13:09,903 --> 01:13:13,244
So we will definitely look at the best way to report that to you.

731
01:13:13,345 --> 01:13:15,105
Thank you for bringing it.

732
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:15,266
Yeah.

733
01:13:15,446 --> 01:13:29,713
And then I guess, Superintendent, the other thing that comes to mind is if we fixed our tier one opportunity tomorrow, there's still a pipeline of kids that

734
01:13:30,962 --> 01:13:31,903
that doesn't help.

735
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:47,929
So, you know, Joan, I know you're on the phone, but I think the other question that lots of parents have, particularly those who are very vocal about the struggles their kids have had is like, they're still advocating and fighting for those things to happen because they're the right things to do.

736
01:13:48,009 --> 01:13:54,752
But by and large, like those opportunities have, are not gonna impact or affect their children, right?

737
01:13:54,772 --> 01:13:57,273
So where their children are sort of squarely onto

738
01:13:57,813 --> 01:14:13,280
meeting additional intervention and I know that's sort of part of not that's not like a tier one curriculum item but I would like to know sort of what we need to be planning for

739
01:14:14,014 --> 01:14:29,176
As we think about tier two and tier three intervention around literacy in the upcoming years, you know, just as a sort of a general rule, but also sort of at the hands of the pandemic what what do we need to be thinking and planning for.

740
01:14:29,716 --> 01:14:35,401
to address any sort of you know learning loss that's really happening in real time.

741
01:14:35,521 --> 01:14:57,339
So I don't know if that's like another curriculum subcommittee meeting or if that is something you all can address during the budget but I feel like the answer is probably like if there's both sides of that coin but I just want to make sure that we are planning for those kids who these these changes at the at the early elementary level that it's not going to

742
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:04,239
to impact them so that we can get them on a path that is more stable for them as well.

743
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:08,593
I can just say yes to what you said.

744
01:15:08,613 --> 01:15:23,205
The children right now, we know that teaching under these conditions, a lot has happened from social emotional learning concerns to gaps that have taken place.

745
01:15:23,245 --> 01:15:28,970
So we're already thinking about what are the modifications that need to be made?

746
01:15:29,351 --> 01:15:33,074
How can we find ways to creatively close the gaps

747
01:15:33,959 --> 01:15:39,704
What are the power standards that are going to be expected of us either being announced this year or for next year?

748
01:15:40,145 --> 01:15:46,610
So we are definitely in the beginning phases of trying to map out what that's going to look like.

749
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:48,172
It's definitely on our radar.

750
01:15:48,812 --> 01:15:55,619
And just as we receive more information and think about where we are, where Medford is at, we will definitely be able to present

751
01:15:57,380 --> 01:16:02,883
to the committee, you know, what our proposals would be, but it definitely is on our radar.

752
01:16:02,983 --> 01:16:08,505
I want you to know that and, you know, the listening audience to know that we're very aware of that.

753
01:16:08,965 --> 01:16:13,127
And we know that we're not alone, but we're going to get through it.

754
01:16:13,287 --> 01:16:21,191
We will come up with a plan and we will, you know, stick to that plan and work it to meet the needs of our students here in Medford.

755
01:16:21,211 --> 01:16:23,172
All right.

756
01:16:23,212 --> 01:16:23,492
Thank you.

757
01:16:24,975 --> 01:16:25,275
Okay.

758
01:16:26,275 --> 01:16:27,776
Any other questions or comments?

759
01:16:29,517 --> 01:16:35,158
If not, I would entertain a motion to adjourn.

760
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:37,599
Motion to adjourn?

761
01:16:38,319 --> 01:16:38,700
Second.

762
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:40,880
Okay.

763
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,641
Jenny, could you call the roll, please?

764
01:16:43,141 --> 01:16:43,521
Sure.

765
01:16:43,621 --> 01:16:44,221
Member Graham?

766
01:16:44,341 --> 01:16:44,681
Yes.

767
01:16:44,882 --> 01:16:45,542
Member McStone?

768
01:16:45,742 --> 01:16:46,002
Yes.

769
01:16:46,747 --> 01:16:47,547
member of Vandercliff?

770
01:16:47,868 --> 01:16:48,128
Yes.

771
01:16:48,688 --> 01:16:48,988
Okay.

772
01:16:49,048 --> 01:16:50,309
Thank you all so very much.

773
01:16:51,209 --> 01:16:52,070
Dr. Chiesa.

774
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:54,211
Thank you very much for your time.

775
01:16:54,271 --> 01:16:55,071
I appreciate it.

776
01:16:55,311 --> 01:16:55,491
Yep.

777
01:16:55,751 --> 01:16:57,772
I think we're on at 545 again.

778
01:16:57,832 --> 01:16:58,473
Is that correct?

779
01:16:59,133 --> 01:16:59,993
That is correct.

780
01:17:00,334 --> 01:17:02,495
And Peter, is Peter still on?

781
01:17:02,815 --> 01:17:03,315
Yes, he is.

782
01:17:03,755 --> 01:17:04,416
Okay.

783
01:17:04,496 --> 01:17:06,216
Peter, I need to talk to you for a second.

784
01:17:07,617 --> 01:17:08,738
So everybody else goodbye.

785
01:17:08,758 --> 01:17:10,439
Thank you.

786
01:17:10,879 --> 01:17:11,359
Bye bye.

787
01:17:17,722 --> 01:17:20,651
Hold on one second, because we are still recording.

788
01:17:21,735 --> 01:17:22,818
So just give me one minute.

789
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,045
And we are still recording.
