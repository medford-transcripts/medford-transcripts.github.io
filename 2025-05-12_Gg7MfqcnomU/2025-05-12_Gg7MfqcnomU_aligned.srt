Here.

46
00:04:42,517 --> 00:04:43,337
Chad Fallon.

47
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:46,359
Here.

48
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,560
Lori Hodgson.

49
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,000
Here.

50
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:50,181
John McLaughlin.

51
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:50,781
Here.

52
00:04:52,322 --> 00:04:53,963
Paul Russo is here.

53
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:54,203
Here.

54
00:04:55,604 --> 00:04:56,484
Philip Santos.

55
00:04:56,684 --> 00:04:56,944
Here.

56
00:04:57,345 --> 00:04:57,465
Hi.

57
00:04:58,983 --> 00:05:00,064
And Lisa Miller.

58
00:05:01,286 --> 00:05:09,916
Okay, so we have 12 present, three absent, so we have a quorum.

59
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:14,822
I wanted to start by welcoming Lisa Miller to the committee.

60
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:18,006
Lisa is one of our vocational teachers here at the high school.

61
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:29,098
As you all may remember from the last time we met, Larry Brown resigned from the committee, had sort of done his year, which is what he committed to do.

62
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:44,227
And we asked, the school committee asked that Marta identify another teacher who could adequately represent the vocational side of the house, which is sort of the role that Larry was playing in that interim space.

63
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:45,668
And she identified Lisa.

64
00:05:45,688 --> 00:05:46,549
So Lisa, welcome.

65
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:47,189
Thank you.

66
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:48,210
We're excited to have you.

67
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,458
Thanks.

68
00:05:50,578 --> 00:06:06,467
OK, the next item on the agenda is our consent agenda, which includes approval of meeting minutes from January 23, which was a communications and community engagement subcommittee, and February 24, which was a full committee meeting.

69
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:09,588
Is there a motion to approve the minutes?

70
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:11,730
Sorry, a motion to approve the consent agenda?

71
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:12,630
So moved.

72
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,912
By Tracy Keene, seconded by Lindy Brown.

73
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:17,429
Okay, I'll call the roll.

74
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:18,570
Jenny Graham, yes.

75
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,751
Mayor Lungo Kern.

76
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:21,432
Yes.

77
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:23,614
Dr. Palusi.

78
00:06:23,734 --> 00:06:23,994
Yes.

79
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:25,296
Dr. Cushing.

80
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:25,676
Yes.

81
00:06:26,076 --> 00:06:26,817
Marta Cabral.

82
00:06:26,977 --> 00:06:27,117
Yes.

83
00:06:27,197 --> 00:06:27,898
Libby Brown.

84
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:28,178
Yes.

85
00:06:28,558 --> 00:06:29,279
Marissa Desmond.

86
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:29,659
Yes.

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,820
Maria Dorsey.

88
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,221
Yes.

89
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:32,362
Brian Hilliard.

90
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:32,442
Yes.

91
00:06:32,902 --> 00:06:33,703
Tracy Keene.

92
00:06:33,883 --> 00:06:34,143
Yes.

93
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,065
Emily Lazaro, absent.

94
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:37,786
Nicole Morrell, absent.

95
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,749
And Aaron Lopate, absent.

96
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:41,830
Luke Preissner.

97
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,430
Yes.

98
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:44,032
And Joan Bowen.

99
00:06:44,212 --> 00:06:44,412
Yes.

100
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:50,113
So 13 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, three absent, the motion is approved.

101
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:55,916
Okay, on to the good stuff.

102
00:06:56,297 --> 00:07:06,422
As you remember, when we met in February, we did a bunch of things, including expanding our OPM selection subcommittee, and

103
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:18,221
That committee subsequently got approval from MSBA to publish our request for services, which you all reviewed in that last meeting and approved.

104
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:21,983
And we published that RFS in March.

105
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:30,167
We held a walkthrough in mid-March with 15 or 20 people in attendance to the walkthrough.

106
00:07:31,748 --> 00:07:33,668
And then we received 10 bids.

107
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:39,887
So the OPM Selection Subcommittee went through the process that was outlined in the RFS.

108
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:49,451
So we all independently scored the 10 proposals and created a shortlist.

109
00:07:49,831 --> 00:07:56,114
And then we held interviews with the folks on the shortlist, checked references, and made a selection.

110
00:07:58,155 --> 00:08:00,856
So we're really excited to introduce

111
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:03,862
you all to left field this evening.

112
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:06,002
They are the apparent successful bidder.

113
00:08:06,642 --> 00:08:08,523
The contract is not finalized.

114
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:12,444
So what that means is we have to send a whole bunch of paperwork to MSBA.

115
00:08:12,904 --> 00:08:15,544
They have to sort of go through, provide feedback.

116
00:08:16,465 --> 00:08:23,126
And then we will have to go to what they call the OPM selection panel in early June, which we are scheduled to do.

117
00:08:23,987 --> 00:08:25,487
Not until that happens.

118
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,301
Can we sign the actual contract with left field?

119
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:33,743
So they graciously agreed to be here on their own dime at this point.

120
00:08:33,803 --> 00:08:35,744
So thank you left field team for that.

121
00:08:36,544 --> 00:08:43,387
And then once the MSBA approves, the city can execute the contract.

122
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:45,347
So what does that mean?

123
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:55,051
It means that between now and then, we have already gotten record requests from bidders who wanna know how could I improve

124
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,222
You know, how could I improve the competitiveness of my proposal and all those things?

125
00:08:59,642 --> 00:09:04,265
All of that has to wait until the contract is signed, which will happen in mid-June.

126
00:09:05,906 --> 00:09:09,789
I've had a couple of UL requests, some of those documents as well.

127
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:16,713
And we have to sort of apply the same logic in terms of responding to those requests, is my understanding.

128
00:09:17,594 --> 00:09:21,296
But the elected team does have a presentation to share with us tonight.

129
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,201
that you'll get a copy of that to take home with you.

130
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:29,802
Hello, hello, hello.

131
00:09:32,342 --> 00:09:36,643
So I just want to stop right there before I introduce the left field team.

132
00:09:36,763 --> 00:09:39,504
Are there any questions about where we are in the process?

133
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:41,124
No?

134
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:43,705
OK.

135
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:48,346
I still feel like we're in the paperwork phase of the process.

136
00:09:48,426 --> 00:09:51,787
But I'm super excited that left field is here, because they're going to help with the paperwork.

137
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:04,872
Yeah, no, that's OK.

138
00:10:05,592 --> 00:10:11,856
So we had to, by last week, submit a full package of information to MSBA.

139
00:10:12,557 --> 00:10:15,839
And then from there, the MSBA reviews the package.

140
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,840
They'll respond to us with questions.

141
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:25,565
I actually got a document, and there was a sentence that was like two choppy half sentences, and they asked me to consolidate them, so I did that.

142
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,888
So there's some back and forth that we'll do as they're vetting the paperwork.

143
00:10:30,561 --> 00:10:37,042
And then once they- It's at the Museum of Science.

144
00:10:37,142 --> 00:10:41,583
Once everything is in order, it goes to the OPM selection panel.

145
00:10:42,484 --> 00:10:56,007
That panel reviews the submission and takes a vote to either agree with our recommendation or to, I guess they could send us back to the drawing board if for some reason they felt like something was out of order.

146
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:57,427
And then we exit.

147
00:10:58,255 --> 00:11:09,400
So specific to that, is it one of the regular scheduled monthly meetings or is it a board meeting?

148
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:18,804
It's not a board meeting, but it is a scheduled, I believe, public meeting that happens once a month, if I remember correctly.

149
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,385
So we're in the queue for this upcoming month?

150
00:11:22,685 --> 00:11:23,566
June 2nd.

151
00:11:24,426 --> 00:11:26,787
Yeah, June 2nd, we are on the list.

152
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:32,770
They take a limited number of communities each month.

153
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:38,711
This is where their process is easy to understand, but kind of rigid at the same time.

154
00:11:39,972 --> 00:11:49,075
But we got into the queue because what we did in February was approve the RFS even ahead of the invitation to the next phase.

155
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,455
That meant we were right there.

156
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:57,097
I submitted all of the paperwork the next day, and we were able to get into the queue for June.

157
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:03,775
So that sort of speed and turnaround talk, we'll come back to that when we get to the end of the meeting.

158
00:12:04,896 --> 00:12:11,180
But until we can get our team on board, it's just all of us in a room with some paperwork.

159
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:17,705
And the real exciting stuff happens when you can get the actual experts in the room to start thinking about what does this look like.

160
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:23,029
So I'm going to stop talking and invite the left field team to join us.

161
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,852
So Jim Rogers is the principal.

162
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,500
of left field.

163
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:32,782
And then Matt and Linda will be our day to day people on the project.

164
00:12:33,242 --> 00:12:35,483
They come with a much bigger team.

165
00:12:35,843 --> 00:12:40,964
Some folks had vacations and different things to to deal with, but I'm going to turn it over to them.

166
00:12:41,465 --> 00:12:47,806
I just want you all to know it was absolutely unanimous that left field was the right partner for us.

167
00:13:07,115 --> 00:13:15,120
There are educational advisors also, really, really good practices, and good people.

168
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:25,868
All the people that I met, the people that helped make it look amazing.

169
00:13:26,648 --> 00:13:30,391
Everybody involved was just, you know, absolutely amazing.

170
00:13:31,632 --> 00:13:32,072
Thank you again.

171
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:36,090
I just want to thank the committee.

172
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:47,575
So that was Dr. Cushing, Dr. Gluzman, Dr. Brown, myself, Paul, Fiona, and John.

173
00:13:47,656 --> 00:13:51,257
So we spent a lot of time together in the last class.

174
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:55,039
So I'll turn it over to you all.

175
00:13:57,313 --> 00:14:03,074
And if you want to come stand roughly in this space, Peter can point the camera at you.

176
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:03,815
Perfect.

177
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:04,335
OK.

178
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:08,196
Do you have a microphone that we could follow along with?

179
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:09,456
Yes.

180
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:12,517
We haven't been paid for coffee yet, but I see perfect.

181
00:14:12,737 --> 00:14:14,777
Do you want to email it to me?

182
00:14:14,817 --> 00:14:15,257
Yeah.

183
00:14:15,277 --> 00:14:20,979
I guess I can do that.

184
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:25,960
So there's electronic coffee that's coming, so you guys can see it online.

185
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:40,402
But I want to start where, uh, uh, we put off of this group to provide some momentum really get this project going.

186
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,422
So we're excited to be here.

187
00:14:41,442 --> 00:14:52,905
Uh, Jim Rogers in the principal of left field, um, our experience and talk to you about two key aspects of the project.

188
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:53,525
That makes sense.

189
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,516
Thank you.

190
00:14:57,636 --> 00:14:59,797
Thank you.

191
00:15:25,996 --> 00:15:26,536
to our.

192
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:27,237
I'm.

193
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:27,757
I'm.

194
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,950
Good.

195
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:02,436
So let's see.

196
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:07,541
Test one, test two.

197
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:08,062
Okay.

198
00:16:25,737 --> 00:16:27,238
both public K-12

199
00:16:57,673 --> 00:16:58,053
So.

200
00:16:58,293 --> 00:17:01,294
Projects.

201
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:01,454
Or.

202
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:32,968
That's it.

203
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:34,729
I took experience.

204
00:18:12,562 --> 00:18:13,902
So, these are some of my tools.

205
00:18:14,763 --> 00:18:15,103
Okay.

206
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:38,203
that's in our programs, and we have a true case in technical, and that's the way that we're working.

207
00:18:38,223 --> 00:18:39,543
It's not technical, but it's self-examined.

208
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:42,825
We're working on it, and we're trying to figure out how to solve the technical problems.

209
00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:47,849
It's not technical, but it's self-examined, and we're working on it, and we're trying to figure out how to solve the technical problems.

210
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:55,613
It's not technical, but it's self-examined, and we're working on it, and we're trying to figure out how to solve the technical problems.

211
00:18:56,254 --> 00:19:01,357
It's not technical, but it's self-examined, and we're working on it, and we're trying to figure out how to solve the technical problems.

212
00:19:03,783 --> 00:19:12,627
So this is just a template that might be helpful.

213
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,140
The Commonwealth.

214
00:19:50,882 --> 00:19:54,264
The next slide, we're looking at the team.

215
00:19:55,546 --> 00:20:03,853
And with me tonight, and I'm gonna let them talk about themselves in a moment, is Macklin, Orlando, and Porto, Matt, Linda.

216
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:06,995
But I'll hit some of the people that aren't here and talk a little bit about the team.

217
00:20:08,385 --> 00:20:18,632
If you can go a little up, I think it's between the right now.

218
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:23,055
So I'll be here tonight.

219
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:29,319
I was traveling or playing this morning and very late and couldn't make it.

220
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:31,741
But like Jen very much, she's very experienced.

221
00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:33,122
She used to work for the MSC,

222
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:37,874
K-12 sector.

223
00:20:38,595 --> 00:20:45,021
And next, I'm going to let Linda and Matt talk about themselves.

224
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,063
Hello everyone, my name is Matt.

225
00:20:47,523 --> 00:20:51,667
I will be your main contact, your main senior PM that you'll be working with.

226
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:54,430
You'll be working closely with us along the chat.

227
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:58,333
We have a team of experts which we can touch base on a little bit.

228
00:20:59,074 --> 00:21:00,776
A little bit about myself and then the

229
00:21:05,053 --> 00:21:05,374
years.

230
00:21:05,914 --> 00:21:09,075
I started out as a general contractor.

231
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:14,298
I've worked for Constable Construction for about six years, so I'm very familiar with how the building goes together.

232
00:21:15,378 --> 00:21:23,482
And then in the last seven or eight years, I've been on the outside of the industry, working on school building projects.

233
00:21:35,614 --> 00:21:36,355
Oh geez.

234
00:22:21,728 --> 00:22:21,793
you

235
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,188
Can you hear me now?

236
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,729
Yes, Paul, I just heard you.

237
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:19,133
Okay, well, I'm going to leave that all on, but all the fun things that are going to pop up.

238
00:23:25,355 --> 00:23:26,835
It's got an excellent mic.

239
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:27,416
Give me a second.

240
00:23:33,915 --> 00:23:34,195
And then.

241
00:23:35,297 --> 00:23:37,859
Do you want to move it over that way so that.

242
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,643
Yeah, I don't know this is an exceptional microphones.

243
00:23:42,324 --> 00:23:44,466
Can you just say something that hello.

244
00:23:44,987 --> 00:23:45,788
Can you hear me.

245
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,433
Yes, and I'm getting more that YouTube can hear now.

246
00:23:51,574 --> 00:23:52,435
Okay, great.

247
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:58,870
Now that you can hear me, I'll do a quick recap.

248
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:00,930
My name is Matt Galino.

249
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,852
I'll be your day-to-day contact in your main senior PM.

250
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:16,335
Been in construction industry for about 14 years, started out as a general contractor, and I've been in the OPM industry for the last eight years or so, largely working on school building projects.

251
00:24:18,396 --> 00:24:19,536
I live in Boston now.

252
00:24:20,016 --> 00:24:21,737
I actually lived in Medford for about six years.

253
00:24:22,637 --> 00:24:27,221
I know it well, and it definitely has a little special place in my heart.

254
00:24:27,261 --> 00:24:28,302
I live near Wellington.

255
00:24:30,484 --> 00:24:32,686
And yeah, I'm excited to be here.

256
00:24:34,387 --> 00:24:36,869
Really looking forward to working with everyone.

257
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:40,412
Definitely is going to be a challenging project, but that's part of what we like.

258
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:49,099
And we're excited to help you get a designer on board in the coming months and work with you every step of the way as we

259
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:50,675
get going.

260
00:24:50,695 --> 00:24:55,797
So I'll let Linda introduce herself and then we'll move on to the next part of our presentation.

261
00:24:55,817 --> 00:24:57,477
Great.

262
00:24:58,558 --> 00:24:59,218
I will jump up.

263
00:24:59,278 --> 00:24:59,978
Hi, everyone.

264
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,039
Hopefully you guys can still hear me on the computer.

265
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:04,780
I am Linda Laporto.

266
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:11,002
I am one of the senior project managers assigned to this wonderful, very exciting project.

267
00:25:12,222 --> 00:25:15,063
My background is also in the construction industry.

268
00:25:15,123 --> 00:25:17,224
I spent the better part of the past

269
00:25:19,148 --> 00:25:23,871
25 years in construction management and then OPM world.

270
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:33,618
I have been working solely on school projects since I started working with Jim and ironically there are

271
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,571
99% of them are high school projects.

272
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:53,663
So I've gotten very familiar with what goes into these projects and I've actually worked on some very, very comprehensive and very tricky projects that for all intents and purposes were thought

273
00:25:54,008 --> 00:26:03,312
would not get passed, but through our relationships working with the districts and coming up with great strategies, we were able to go through all these projects.

274
00:26:03,472 --> 00:26:05,073
So very excited to be here.

275
00:26:06,354 --> 00:26:16,698
I was at the tour of the school and I've seen firsthand how well everyone has been doing with working with what they have.

276
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:19,860
And so I can definitely see that there's a

277
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:22,816
huge need for the students and the faculty.

278
00:26:22,836 --> 00:26:24,377
They've done a fantastic job.

279
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:30,303
But I don't ever want to hear that somebody feels like they've been attacked by their building.

280
00:26:30,343 --> 00:26:35,909
So I'm hoping we can get started on this project very quickly.

281
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,232
It's going to be a very

282
00:26:38,983 --> 00:27:01,335
prescriptive process with the MSBA, but we've got some great team members and we have a lot of experience working with the MSBA and we'll be here to help guide you guys through that process and then also figure out the best way on how to get the rest of the city of Medford on board to get this building actually built.

283
00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:02,756
So that's what we're here for.

284
00:27:02,816 --> 00:27:04,397
We're super excited to do so.

285
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:12,098
And probably for my last piece, I just, I just want to stay there for 1 more minute.

286
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:20,446
So, the way the team is set up, if, you know, this is the top row and the bottom row, and you just met the top row, which is really the core participants.

287
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:25,751
And if you notice this little star flag over over Matt's name, you probably can't read it, but it says day to day.

288
00:27:26,372 --> 00:27:29,295
So, Matt's going to be the day to day contact for the project.

289
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:35,044
He's going to be supported by Jen and Linda as the core participants.

290
00:27:35,064 --> 00:27:36,585
So that is kind of the core team.

291
00:27:37,285 --> 00:27:41,346
On the bottom row, what we have is we bring in the rest of the folks to support them.

292
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,667
And we call it the team of experts.

293
00:27:43,227 --> 00:27:46,088
And they flex in and flex out as we need them as part of the project.

294
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:50,390
The first one is someone that Jenny mentioned, and that's Adele Sands.

295
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,230
She's our educational liaison.

296
00:27:52,491 --> 00:27:55,772
She is a former superintendent, a former teacher, a former administrator.

297
00:27:56,472 --> 00:28:09,575
She went through her own very complicated construction project, and the hope is she can come here, help with educational planning, help with programming, help kind of translate the process to the teacher's administration.

298
00:28:09,715 --> 00:28:10,355
She's been through it.

299
00:28:10,975 --> 00:28:13,176
She can kind of let you know what she's been through, what to expect.

300
00:28:13,236 --> 00:28:15,376
So we think she's going to be a key member of the team.

301
00:28:15,997 --> 00:28:17,757
Lynn Stapleton is our project advisor.

302
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:19,917
She is our key MSBA advisor.

303
00:28:19,977 --> 00:28:21,898
She has worked like Jen

304
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:26,607
And like some of our other people have worked with the since their inception.

305
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:30,829
So, when we need lens help on issues, we're going to drag her in.

306
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:34,490
We're bringing her now Jenny and some of the concerns we've had about procurement.

307
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:38,232
Kevin Sullivan is going to be our public outreach guy.

308
00:28:38,772 --> 00:28:43,234
So, Kevin just went through a very rigorous vote in.

309
00:28:45,107 --> 00:28:46,468
or South Shore Tech High School.

310
00:28:46,989 --> 00:28:55,977
It was a technical vocational high school, which is a very difficult vote to achieve because it's not really owned by one community, right?

311
00:28:55,997 --> 00:29:01,582
There's four or five or 10 or 15 communities that really share in the vocational school.

312
00:29:02,122 --> 00:29:08,728
And because of that, these towns all have their own priorities, whether it's a police station, a fire station, another school.

313
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:13,211
So it's really hard to obtain a positive vote for a vocational school.

314
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:18,314
We did so with a huge effort and we were able to win.

315
00:29:19,735 --> 00:29:23,697
Celsior Tech was able to carry the vote rather successfully.

316
00:29:23,717 --> 00:29:34,704
And we're gonna use that same vigor and approach here to help with what seems to be a very organized group already in terms of trying to achieve a successful project.

317
00:29:35,787 --> 00:29:36,807
Next is Jay Faxon.

318
00:29:36,847 --> 00:29:37,908
He's our MVP expert.

319
00:29:38,088 --> 00:29:39,528
That's mechanical electrical plumbing.

320
00:29:40,249 --> 00:29:44,330
So he will come in at various times to review drawings.

321
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,931
He will come in during construction to audit the construction process.

322
00:29:48,451 --> 00:29:50,052
He will oversee the commissioning process.

323
00:29:50,992 --> 00:29:53,073
And you will find Jay to be a valued member.

324
00:29:53,773 --> 00:30:05,139
We also have a move manager in Josh Brewster, a quality and design review person in Terrence T. Connolly, and finally, a clerk of the works that will be out there for construction.

325
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,140
So it takes a village.

326
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,080
We have a village.

327
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,260
We have a very talented village.

328
00:30:09,921 --> 00:30:12,122
And we're, again, excited to get going on this project.

329
00:30:13,763 --> 00:30:14,123
I'll say it.

330
00:30:14,263 --> 00:30:14,783
I'll do it.

331
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:16,824
You want to do it?

332
00:30:16,844 --> 00:30:17,264
Yeah, I'll say it.

333
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:27,978
So one of the key questions, especially the MSBA has, and you will all have is, you know, what is our capacity to work on this project?

334
00:30:28,812 --> 00:30:32,093
Matt has 100% of his time, for example, as a day to day guy.

335
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:35,775
Dedicated to this project what we've shown here as part of this chart.

336
00:30:36,675 --> 00:30:40,976
Is, um, you know, Matt showing 40% of his time because that's what we think it's going to take.

337
00:30:42,097 --> 00:30:48,919
Jens at 30% and Linda's at 30%, but the key notion there, or the key identifier, it says 30 plus 40 plus and 30 plus.

338
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:57,044
Which means, although we've identified percentages as around 3040%, whatever the project needs are.

339
00:30:57,645 --> 00:30:59,886
These folks dedicated to to seeing it through.

340
00:30:59,986 --> 00:31:06,431
So the hours are just a representation of where we're going to be, but we're all in on whatever the project needs are.

341
00:31:07,872 --> 00:31:10,473
And with that said.

342
00:31:11,574 --> 00:31:13,415
Yeah, I'll touch on this quickly.

343
00:31:13,776 --> 00:31:14,216
Oh, please.

344
00:31:14,236 --> 00:31:14,336
So.

345
00:31:20,084 --> 00:31:32,732
There's a kind of a crunch period.

346
00:31:32,852 --> 00:31:36,314
Maybe you start out with a small team to get an idea of what's ahead.

347
00:31:36,334 --> 00:31:38,175
You begin to wrap your hands around it.

348
00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:39,416
You bring in additional staff.

349
00:31:39,736 --> 00:31:41,397
Your staffing profile grows.

350
00:31:41,637 --> 00:31:43,458
It peaks at a point.

351
00:31:43,518 --> 00:31:45,319
You would achieve some threshold that's

352
00:31:46,547 --> 00:31:48,988
a construction threshold, maybe, I'm not sure, just guessing.

353
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:49,669
Key milestones.

354
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:50,569
Key milestones.

355
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,890
And then you begin rolling people off.

356
00:31:53,991 --> 00:31:55,351
So that's kind of what I have in mind.

357
00:31:56,732 --> 00:32:05,477
In terms of other projects that you have, I know you're involved with the Revere High School, which is a very large project, almost 2,500 kids.

358
00:32:06,397 --> 00:32:08,738
And it began not that long ago.

359
00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:13,100
I'm not aware of other ongoing projects you have.

360
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:14,321
But my question.

361
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:15,762
I can put that slide back up.

362
00:32:15,822 --> 00:32:16,182
That's all.

363
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:18,746
Not necessarily, just talk to it.

364
00:32:20,507 --> 00:32:29,450
What I want to ask is for Revere specifically, where are you in terms of that ramp up?

365
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:44,537
And if we pitch a perfect game and things begin in serious measure in the new year, what does your staffing capacity look like

366
00:32:46,156 --> 00:32:48,919
in the context of ongoing projects.

367
00:32:49,459 --> 00:32:55,724
So first, the top line, which is the core group, they're dedicated to this project and maybe one other.

368
00:32:56,385 --> 00:33:02,490
So there really isn't a worry about the core group, because I have to sleep at night, and I can't have those people all over the place.

369
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:05,233
So the core group is the one that's dedicated to this project.

370
00:33:05,593 --> 00:33:08,436
So there's no interaction with Revere of the core group, for example.

371
00:33:09,777 --> 00:33:10,537
They have their team.

372
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,238
We have our team.

373
00:33:11,898 --> 00:33:16,900
It's the lower group, to your point, that kind of ebbs and flows depending on the needs of the project.

374
00:33:17,601 --> 00:33:22,983
And in Revere, specifically, we are in the permitting process, closing in on the start of construction.

375
00:33:23,724 --> 00:33:34,809
And so, for example, Adele, our educational liaison, she has kind of dropped off quite a bit because we've gone through the programming stages and got through a large part of the design.

376
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:37,230
So she's been able, to your point, the milestones have passed.

377
00:33:37,811 --> 00:33:38,871
She's been able to drop off.

378
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:42,430
We didn't have a Lynn on that job.

379
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,011
We didn't have a Kevin, a Jay.

380
00:33:44,051 --> 00:33:45,812
We have a Jay on that job, an MVP expert.

381
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:51,476
He has helped in the design of the project, going through the design milestones where we haven't gotten to construction yet.

382
00:33:51,516 --> 00:33:53,177
In fact, he doesn't come to the end of construction.

383
00:33:53,758 --> 00:33:59,942
He comes in just before the ceiling goes in to look at all the mechanical equipment and make sure it's all installed correctly.

384
00:34:00,682 --> 00:34:07,267
So he won't come in until much later in the Revere project, which will be even later here because we're a couple of years

385
00:34:07,647 --> 00:34:09,908
further down the road in Medford.

386
00:34:11,128 --> 00:34:18,570
We have three MEP experts in left field.

387
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:33,635
I think some of these folks do overlap, but the way the project, to your point, is staggered, I don't think it's going to be an issue, and I think we have the right staffing to control.

388
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:38,614
But anything other, any concerns about Revere versus here that I can specifically talk about?

389
00:34:39,415 --> 00:34:45,901
I'm just trying to get a sense of what other projects do you have that are kind of just ahead of us?

390
00:34:46,281 --> 00:34:49,304
Is it only Revere, or is it Revere plus one, plus two?

391
00:34:49,484 --> 00:34:51,166
Yeah, I just want to know.

392
00:34:51,226 --> 00:34:52,927
Yeah, we can go through them one by one.

393
00:34:52,947 --> 00:34:54,689
A lot of them are in this planning stage.

394
00:34:55,713 --> 00:35:01,560
Uh, you know, um, uh, 1 of the ones that I don't think we show tonight as I'm thinking here is Brockton.

395
00:35:02,281 --> 00:35:07,588
So, Brockton is the largest 1 of the largest high schools, if not the largest high school east of the Mississippi.

396
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:09,130
It's a concern, right?

397
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,633
And that's why we talk about capacity, right?

398
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:13,014
The, we have 10 or 12 high schools managing.

399
00:35:15,653 --> 00:35:17,533
How do we manage those all together?

400
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:21,895
And that's how we do it with, like I said, Matt has 100% capacity.

401
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:26,456
I've always gonna have the staff on board to be able to manage Medford.

402
00:35:26,856 --> 00:35:30,677
So it's not impacted by Brockton, Revere or what have you.

403
00:35:30,717 --> 00:35:33,017
So it's a valid concern.

404
00:35:33,997 --> 00:35:37,718
We can talk about it further and I can show you the staffing model and how that works.

405
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:44,200
But I'm confident that we have the team here and the resources to take on that.

406
00:35:45,336 --> 00:35:46,076
You're welcome.

407
00:35:46,236 --> 00:35:57,940
Yeah, and I will say just by way of some color commentary, that was true of every player that made it to the finalist list.

408
00:35:58,941 --> 00:36:08,764
The folks that didn't make it to the finalist list often were much smaller or didn't have as much high school experience, which was what weighted them out.

409
00:36:08,964 --> 00:36:14,706
But everyone who came and presented had a pretty comparable story in terms of staffing approaches.

410
00:36:15,868 --> 00:36:17,209
timing and all of that good stuff.

411
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:22,211
We mentioned the OPM panel, um, you know, that we have to go through, was it June 2nd?

412
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:22,611
Yep.

413
00:36:22,992 --> 00:36:23,652
On June 2nd.

414
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:26,573
And one of the things they look at very closely is our staffing.

415
00:36:27,534 --> 00:36:32,996
Um, and so we understand that, uh, and we address, we address those issues, you know, directly.

416
00:36:36,978 --> 00:36:37,579
Capacity.

417
00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:38,699
Any other questions?

418
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,019
Nope.

419
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:50,653
No, like Jim said, with the OPM panel, it might be one of the only reasons where the MSBA would say, no, you can't use left field.

420
00:36:50,853 --> 00:36:51,573
They have too much work.

421
00:36:51,953 --> 00:36:52,834
That's not gonna be the case.

422
00:36:52,874 --> 00:36:57,756
Like Jim said, I am 100% available for this job, so I'm not on any other MSBA jobs.

423
00:36:58,537 --> 00:37:00,878
I'm actually not in any non-MSBA jobs either.

424
00:37:01,718 --> 00:37:08,282
So that won't be an issue for us when we get to the OPM panel, but it is something that they look at closely.

425
00:37:09,002 --> 00:37:16,767
I'm not going to spend a ton of time on the educational program, but we did want to put it up here only because it's the cornerstone of how this building will get built.

426
00:37:18,248 --> 00:37:20,770
Everything comes from the educational program.

427
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,872
So we're going to spend a lot of time working with the educators.

428
00:37:24,772 --> 00:37:37,421
Once we get a designer on board, they will have an educational planner who is going to take the bulk of that responsibility, meeting with educators, understanding what you need, what works now, what doesn't work now, how do we make it better.

429
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:43,403
So it's it's really kind of the again the cornerstone of the project.

430
00:37:43,604 --> 00:37:47,725
It's what the MSBA requires you to follow.

431
00:37:48,846 --> 00:37:51,827
It tells you how big the building will be based on how many students.

432
00:37:53,388 --> 00:37:56,249
So it's a very prescribed process and it's something that

433
00:37:58,581 --> 00:38:13,988
we'll spend a lot of time on in the early design phases through feasibility, really until we get to schematic design, through the first few phases of feasibility, which is the preferred, sorry, preliminary design program, and then the preferred schematic report.

434
00:38:14,448 --> 00:38:23,872
During those two phases is when we'll really focus on the ed plan, which again, will really kind of dictate the design of the building.

435
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:26,293
Let me go ahead down.

436
00:38:28,799 --> 00:38:32,525
Timeline, just to touch quickly on some of the key dates.

437
00:38:33,727 --> 00:38:36,731
Like we said, June 2nd is your OPM panel.

438
00:38:36,872 --> 00:38:41,619
Once that takes place, you'll officially be able to contract with left field.

439
00:38:43,018 --> 00:38:47,981
We are already working on the next phase, the designer selection process.

440
00:38:49,302 --> 00:38:55,665
So we have pulled together a request for services for designers, very similar to what you did for the OPM selection.

441
00:38:56,305 --> 00:38:59,527
You advertise it, it's got to go into the central register, combines.

442
00:39:01,728 --> 00:39:10,493
and it will be advertised for a few weeks, we'll get designer proposals in, and we'll start to review them as quickly as we can.

443
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:18,958
We are trying to expedite this phase of the project a little bit, knowing that we're a little bit delayed with the OPM selection.

444
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:26,783
So we are aiming to get on the July designer selection panel, similar to the OPM panel, once you

445
00:39:27,683 --> 00:39:32,329
go through all of the designer selection interviews and view all the proposals.

446
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:33,991
You'll make a selection.

447
00:39:37,736 --> 00:39:44,765
We'll make a selection, but there is a designer selection panel that you also need to go to, which we'll get into a little bit more

448
00:39:47,107 --> 00:39:49,649
as we get into the design RFS towards the end of the meeting.

449
00:39:50,950 --> 00:40:10,725
But that's kind of the next big key date after the OPM panel is trying to get on the July designer selection panel so that we can select a designer and hopefully in August start looking at different options, different sites, and really kind of get a sense of what this project could be.

450
00:40:11,265 --> 00:40:12,186
Well, did you have a question?

451
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:16,780
So we got a copy of a draft schedule right with documents.

452
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,341
Yep.

453
00:40:17,961 --> 00:40:32,966
And just listening to the stuff that just here is I know he's just like we're going to try to expedite things, but the panels on June 2 but we're planning on submitting in our best MSBA on June 3 is that is this is this reflect that timeline in there as well.

454
00:40:32,986 --> 00:40:35,507
I mean, that seems very aggressive.

455
00:40:35,527 --> 00:40:35,587
So,

456
00:40:38,168 --> 00:40:41,649
Can you just hold your question till we get to the RFS review?

457
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:46,852
It is like, there's not a lot of like wiggle room in this process.

458
00:40:46,892 --> 00:40:47,952
Like it's a template.

459
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:48,933
You cannot change it.

460
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:52,714
If you change it, they will ask you to change it back.

461
00:40:53,054 --> 00:40:57,056
So it's not as complex as it sounds to get it out the door.

462
00:40:57,616 --> 00:40:59,517
It's really about like, can we get

463
00:41:00,115 --> 00:41:03,198
in the queue with MSBA for the right time.

464
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,561
But we can talk about that as soon as left field is done with this part of the presentation.

465
00:41:06,602 --> 00:41:09,484
But we have teed it up, so we can do something similar to that, yes.

466
00:41:10,786 --> 00:41:12,728
All right, you want to go to the next one?

467
00:41:12,768 --> 00:41:12,868
Yep.

468
00:41:12,908 --> 00:41:15,831
You want to?

469
00:41:19,572 --> 00:41:22,436
Yeah, I think it's, it's a little redundant based on that.

470
00:41:22,737 --> 00:41:32,592
Yeah, yeah, Jim Jim kind of touched on on the schools that we had chapter 74 experience and that's obviously going to be a part of this project, something we're very familiar with.

471
00:41:34,775 --> 00:41:35,736
Jim talked about Adele.

472
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:40,500
She had Chapter 74 programs when she was the superintendent of schools.

473
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:47,825
So again, a really good source of knowledge that we'll have through Adele since she went through it.

474
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:57,753
And again, it really will help the educators and people that haven't been through the process before kind of understand, like, how do I get what I want into a building?

475
00:41:57,773 --> 00:42:03,678
And Adele will be able to kind of translate that language a little bit between education and building.

476
00:42:08,995 --> 00:42:22,379
CM at risk, this was something that came up on the questions and we wanted to touch base on the difference between deliverables, CM at risk and design bid build are the two kind of different contracts that you can do.

477
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:37,104
The kind of easiest way to think about the differences between the two, like we have here for CM, you're hiring a construction manager service to manage a project, whereas with design bid build, you're purchasing

478
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:40,266
the building based off of a series of documents.

479
00:42:40,746 --> 00:42:57,319
So construction manager at risk, you bring on a builder much earlier in the process, they get involved, they'll do an early estimate in schematic design, they'll work on schedule, they'll get involved in the logistics plan, it just gets the builder much more involved early on in the process.

480
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:03,584
Whereas design bid build, the designer will complete the drawings, the specifications, all of the documents,

481
00:43:04,304 --> 00:43:08,409
and then it goes out to bid, and then a low bid wins, and then you move on from there.

482
00:43:10,011 --> 00:43:18,881
We'll spend significant time talking about this dual aspect of which contract methodology makes sense in future meetings, so we just want to touch base on here.

483
00:43:19,461 --> 00:43:23,064
It's too early, but we will talk about this at length.

484
00:43:23,524 --> 00:43:29,468
Yeah, it will be definitely a big point of discussion for us as we get a designer on board and start to look at the options.

485
00:43:29,488 --> 00:43:32,330
It's definitely a little early to start talking about it.

486
00:43:33,771 --> 00:43:38,354
We do have some examples of some preliminary site ideas of this site.

487
00:43:40,563 --> 00:43:43,624
that we'll show at the end of the presentation, and we can kind of talk about it.

488
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:49,646
These are all our K to 12 projects that are being delivered under CM at risk.

489
00:43:49,706 --> 00:43:53,248
About 90% of what we do is constructive manager at risk.

490
00:43:54,728 --> 00:44:03,431
So it's something we're very familiar with, and it's something that we'll weigh as we get further into the process.

491
00:44:07,013 --> 00:44:07,193
Yes.

492
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,351
I'll kick it into the next one.

493
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:22,660
So part of what we were asked to talk about during our initial meeting, which was a great, more of a longer conversation, which we love.

494
00:44:23,621 --> 00:44:26,223
We don't want to stand here and just talk at you.

495
00:44:26,243 --> 00:44:30,727
So I want to go through this very, very briefly, but what we

496
00:44:31,525 --> 00:44:46,715
internally talked about as a team are figuring out what are some of the challenges that we're going to be facing with this project and that's also guiding us through how we set up our team and how we can best help the project and move along.

497
00:44:47,895 --> 00:45:01,725
And so I know there's a lot of pieces to this project, but where we usually start with one of the biggest pieces to be helpful is understanding all the stakeholders.

498
00:45:01,945 --> 00:45:15,334
All the different stakeholders are all gonna have different priorities, and it's up to us to come up with a plan to make sure that everybody has the right information at the right time to really make this the most successful project that we can.

499
00:45:16,634 --> 00:45:20,696
If you want to move to the next slide, please.

500
00:45:20,936 --> 00:45:31,582
I'm not going to talk in great detail about this, but community outreach is one of the biggest pieces that make our projects successful.

501
00:45:33,183 --> 00:45:38,485
Part of that is utilizing a multitude of different types of tools.

502
00:45:39,506 --> 00:45:45,549
Obviously, in today's day and age, everything is much more geared towards technology.

503
00:45:46,799 --> 00:45:59,850
But we do like the meetings where we're just face-to-face talking to the community, inviting them into the conversations early on, making sure that everybody always has the right information.

504
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:11,119
It's one of the key components to a successful campaign and project and getting a successful project through the whole process.

505
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:23,494
And it's a great way for us to sort of be the outlet of we're fact-based, we're here to support anybody, we're here to answer any questions.

506
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:27,199
And that's what we continue to do throughout the process.

507
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,142
There's also

508
00:46:29,822 --> 00:46:39,386
a great way to involve the students in this particular process, especially when you have vocational classes and media programs.

509
00:46:40,226 --> 00:46:50,731
It's a great way for and it has been very successful on some of our other projects is to have the students get very involved with media outlets, recordings, videos,

510
00:46:51,971 --> 00:46:53,832
being at the meetings, helping us.

511
00:46:54,373 --> 00:47:01,856
They are absolutely wonderful key components of getting the information out there.

512
00:47:02,957 --> 00:47:12,482
So these are just some of the newsletters, media, local media, Facebook, whatever you need us to patrol, we will.

513
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:27,570
The other item, which is the next slide in your presentation here is the project website and we do many different versions of it, whether it's an existing project website that we help.

514
00:47:29,431 --> 00:47:38,198
To update and make it more project oriented or if we start from scratch, it all depends on the district and what they're.

515
00:47:39,171 --> 00:47:40,152
what their wishes are.

516
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:52,877
But they are a great resource for the, especially for the group in this room, to have just a QR code to send folks to this website.

517
00:47:52,997 --> 00:47:54,438
It's always fact-based.

518
00:47:54,678 --> 00:48:00,961
It's our, what I refer to as a virtual file cabinet where all the information lands, but it's all fact-based.

519
00:48:01,061 --> 00:48:01,421
So when

520
00:48:01,882 --> 00:48:11,321
When rumors are flying and people are asking you questions, you can just say, here's the QR code for this, go to this website, we'll have FAQs, we'll have all the information.

521
00:48:11,886 --> 00:48:13,347
Where are we in the process?

522
00:48:13,527 --> 00:48:14,447
Go to the website.

523
00:48:15,427 --> 00:48:27,552
So it's become a really, really helpful tool, especially for the school building committee to answer questions versus trying to remember what you were talking about at the last meeting and forwarding that information.

524
00:48:27,652 --> 00:48:32,594
So as we hear about this information or disinformation, you know, in the public,

525
00:48:33,323 --> 00:48:37,524
We try to create FAQs around those issues.

526
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:41,965
And as Linda said, trying to make it a lot more fact-based.

527
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:45,565
So when we hear things that are trying to drift, we create an FAQ around that.

528
00:48:46,066 --> 00:48:47,206
We give the real information.

529
00:48:47,226 --> 00:48:48,646
We direct people to the website.

530
00:48:49,066 --> 00:48:52,427
We try to control the flow of information, at least the control of facts as best we can.

531
00:48:53,567 --> 00:48:56,928
And the website, I should mention also, is controlled by our team.

532
00:48:57,488 --> 00:48:59,828
So it's quick, easy to update.

533
00:49:00,268 --> 00:49:02,289
That's why they're not always super flashy.

534
00:49:03,429 --> 00:49:08,892
high tech, but they do get the information out there very easily.

535
00:49:09,032 --> 00:49:11,633
And then we also have the opportunity to update things.

536
00:49:11,773 --> 00:49:19,578
So if something is out there, we can act on it quickly and hopefully spread more facts about the project.

537
00:49:22,179 --> 00:49:31,524
We did look at during the initial, when we received the request for services, we understand that there's

538
00:49:32,163 --> 00:49:44,052
Currently, three different sites that have been talked about part of this big process, which is why we're pushing so hard to get the designer on board because they're really the key player in getting this started.

539
00:49:44,893 --> 00:49:55,361
Throughout the MSBA's process, they have a series of deadlines that we have to maintain to stay within that feasibility study guideline that you have of about 26 months right now.

540
00:49:58,043 --> 00:50:07,031
So part of what the design team and with our help, we'll start deciphering all the different options.

541
00:50:07,732 --> 00:50:11,916
We are actually required by the MSBA to look at several different options.

542
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:18,242
If you go to the next slide, what we did was sort of look at

543
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:35,720
we sort of did our own version of looking at your site, looking at the challenges, looking at the options, and we just started diving into a little bit your existing site because it's yours, you own it, it kind of makes the most sense to start looking in that direction.

544
00:50:36,961 --> 00:50:46,345
The MSBA requires us to look at both a new building, an ad reno, and just strictly a code upgrade to the building, to the existing building.

545
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,722
The code upgrade requires you to not move any walls.

546
00:50:51,043 --> 00:50:53,105
So it very quickly.

547
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:55,147
I have it on good authority that so far.

548
00:50:55,187 --> 00:51:01,292
I don't think anybody is actually chosen that option because if you're in this program, you most likely have inefficience.

549
00:51:02,357 --> 00:51:06,559
classroom sizes and hallways and inefficient buildings.

550
00:51:07,259 --> 00:51:15,203
But they do require us and the design team to do very, very detailed studies of each one of the options.

551
00:51:15,483 --> 00:51:19,064
So what we did was just sort of look at your sites.

552
00:51:19,584 --> 00:51:22,766
Is there even room to do a renovation?

553
00:51:22,826 --> 00:51:25,207
And the short answer is yes, this is

554
00:51:25,867 --> 00:51:33,490
This is our experience of what we've done on previous projects and just having the experience of being builders in our background.

555
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:40,612
There's definitely an option of being able to do a renovation if you go to the next one.

556
00:51:42,313 --> 00:51:53,237
There's the addition and even the addition and renovation, there's still enough room and then everything else that anything else that could be added to that, whether it's

557
00:51:54,150 --> 00:52:13,415
trying to acquire more land or anything like that are obviously going to be helpful and be very, very great to study in more details to possibly maybe alleviate some of the traffic problems, for instance, if you're having more leeway with a little more space.

558
00:52:13,855 --> 00:52:17,256
But those are all part of what's going to be studied.

559
00:52:17,556 --> 00:52:20,477
And we've had projects where we started out with

560
00:52:21,886 --> 00:52:25,388
23 different options that have been whittled down to 11, down to three.

561
00:52:25,428 --> 00:52:35,136
And then once you get about halfway through the feasibility study, you ultimately have to make a decision as a committee, what you think is the preferred site.

562
00:52:35,256 --> 00:52:36,918
And that could be anything at this point.

563
00:52:37,939 --> 00:52:38,699
We don't know.

564
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,142
And you're going to be hearing that from us a lot.

565
00:52:42,202 --> 00:52:43,283
We don't know yet.

566
00:52:44,944 --> 00:52:49,228
But that's part of what the next 24 to 26 months are going to take you through.

567
00:52:50,611 --> 00:53:05,743
So this may fall into the legal category, but when I got into this property, Google Maps, it strikes me that it's surrounded by a lot of state-managed forest.

568
00:53:05,883 --> 00:53:10,786
Is that completely off the table to require some of the adjacent land?

569
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:17,992
I don't know what the rules are for an organization like the DCR that manages acres and acres of forest

570
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,182
It is absolutely in the realm of possibility.

571
00:53:26,322 --> 00:53:28,443
It has been done before.

572
00:53:28,463 --> 00:53:29,924
I haven't done it personally.

573
00:53:30,024 --> 00:53:34,627
Lynn Stapleton, our project advisor, has done that process before.

574
00:53:34,647 --> 00:53:38,850
It's lengthy, it's complicated, but it's not unobtainable.

575
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:48,896
And these are all parts and pieces that come into play when the design team is on board and we start running options and also, of course,

576
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:55,171
there's the never ending budget and with budget comes time, right?

577
00:53:55,231 --> 00:54:06,960
So there are certain things that might just not make sense because they're just going to be too time consuming and you're going to end up losing your MSBA participation because it would take too long, et cetera.

578
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:11,444
The list is long, but the short answer is it has been done before.

579
00:54:11,524 --> 00:54:16,848
It's not an impossibility at all, but we as a team will look at all possibilities.

580
00:54:18,934 --> 00:54:20,315
But yes, it is too early to tell.

581
00:54:23,857 --> 00:54:33,144
If you wouldn't mind going to the last slide, we just kind of wanted to highlight that, yes, you could also build a new building on this site.

582
00:54:33,384 --> 00:54:36,486
It's not out of the realm of possibilities either.

583
00:54:37,467 --> 00:54:48,155
It's actually quite common for us, especially high schools, unless you're talking about Revere, who just happened to have 18 acres sitting around that nobody wanted.

584
00:54:49,302 --> 00:55:10,126
sure, but if you don't have that luxury, a lot of our projects, in particular the high school projects, we do the sort of flip-flop is you build a new building in the fields, you contend with not having great opportunities for the athletics team for a while, but you build a new building and then

585
00:55:10,898 --> 00:55:16,161
tear down the old building and build the fields or replace the fields in that location.

586
00:55:16,261 --> 00:55:21,664
So there's definitely, and that's also going to be considered an option.

587
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:26,427
And again, that is staying within the confines of your site.

588
00:55:26,647 --> 00:55:28,709
But all this is gonna get studied.

589
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:32,030
The size of the building is going to get studied.

590
00:55:32,551 --> 00:55:36,533
The size of the building is gonna come down to what your student enrollment is.

591
00:55:36,953 --> 00:55:39,235
Each student has a required space.

592
00:55:40,248 --> 00:55:43,229
What are the additional programs that you're trying to put in here?

593
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:49,970
You've got your pre-K and your, all the other programs, district programs that are going to be in this building.

594
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:57,171
So it's going to be a fine line of trying to come up with that space and really trying to figure out how big is this building?

595
00:55:57,211 --> 00:55:58,731
How many stories do you go up?

596
00:56:00,352 --> 00:56:01,612
Do you build the parking garages?

597
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:02,492
I don't know.

598
00:56:02,712 --> 00:56:08,733
There's lots of different, the sky is essentially the limit, but it's going to be coming down to

599
00:56:09,246 --> 00:56:20,629
the team to work with the school building committee to find an option that is, as I like to refer to, educationally appropriate, but also fiscally possible.

600
00:56:20,649 --> 00:56:26,470
So that's going to be a lot of fine lines to walk in between, but that's what we're here for.

601
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:29,351
That's what we're here to help guide you guys through.

602
00:56:31,292 --> 00:56:36,873
So I think that was the end of sort of, this is a sadly much shorter version of what the board

603
00:56:37,635 --> 00:56:39,576
selection committee had to sit through but.

604
00:56:42,457 --> 00:56:43,998
Are there any other questions?

605
00:56:44,058 --> 00:56:44,418
Absolutely.

606
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,400
Absolutely.

607
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:08,724
This is why the designer selection and getting the designer on board is so important, because they will have some consultants for just about everything.

608
00:57:10,965 --> 00:57:16,947
Actually, if you want to, Jenny, we could move into the designer selection process.

609
00:57:16,987 --> 00:57:21,409
That's actually one of the items as a segue, if you wanted to.

610
00:57:21,449 --> 00:57:21,669
Yeah.

611
00:57:24,127 --> 00:57:30,749
If there are no more questions, the other thing that we did want to talk a little bit about tonight was the next step.

612
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:41,892
So assuming all goes well on June 2nd and we execute the contract, the next step is to bring the architects into the mix, right?

613
00:57:41,952 --> 00:57:44,452
So that we can really begin the study work.

614
00:57:45,233 --> 00:57:53,575
And if you recall, what we did with the RFS for the OPM back in February is we looked at the redlined copy

615
00:57:54,522 --> 00:57:56,923
There were some suggestions made by this group.

616
00:57:57,384 --> 00:58:05,468
There was a vote to approve as amended, and then that went over to the MSBA.

617
00:58:05,668 --> 00:58:10,010
They weighed in, we finalized it, and it went out the door, and here we are.

618
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:21,496
So the idea that the selection team was pushing as we were having conversations with potential partners,

619
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:27,905
was how can we accelerate to the point where we actually get to do the work, right?

620
00:58:27,965 --> 00:58:30,868
How do we get to the point where we get to do the feasibility study?

621
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:39,055
And so I joked with actually all of the finalists that it's like my fleeting wish that my

622
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:45,515
Sandra graduates in 2029 sees the inside of something new before he leaves.

623
00:58:45,615 --> 00:58:50,461
So, and everyone laughed, but I think they also knew I was serious.

624
00:58:51,422 --> 00:58:56,188
And I think for all of us, particularly those people who have kids in this building now.

625
00:58:57,349 --> 00:59:15,477
Every day is like one day that we shouldn't have to wait, you know, we don't want to have to wait anymore right so the question in my mind is how do we accelerate this process as best we can, so that we can spend time in the part of the process where time needs to be spent, which is going to be this design, this design phase.

626
00:59:16,117 --> 00:59:25,741
So I did ask left field to give us a like most aggressive path scenario to getting the designer on board.

627
00:59:26,402 --> 00:59:31,564
So I'm going to let them talk a little bit about the process, because it's quite different than what we just did.

628
00:59:32,304 --> 00:59:35,766
There's some similarities, but the selection process is quite different.

629
00:59:35,786 --> 00:59:40,768
So do you want to take it away, and then we can talk about questions about the draft at RFS that we sent out.

630
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:41,208
Marissa?

631
00:59:41,288 --> 00:59:42,069
I just want to clarify.

632
00:59:43,189 --> 00:59:46,272
purely the designer for the feasibility study, correct?

633
00:59:47,393 --> 00:59:48,674
Correct.

634
00:59:48,694 --> 00:59:51,197
Yes, so, right, there's an option.

635
00:59:51,237 --> 00:59:52,498
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

636
00:59:52,558 --> 00:59:54,119
Yeah, guaranteed that they will.

637
00:59:54,339 --> 00:59:55,520
Okay, exactly.

638
00:59:55,721 --> 01:00:04,969
Yeah, so everything that we're doing right now, it's all for the first stage, which is the feasibility study that we currently have running for about 26 months.

639
01:00:07,044 --> 01:00:13,325
Part of that is the first part, as Jenny mentioned, is the designer selection process.

640
01:00:13,385 --> 01:00:19,947
It's part of MSBA's module of how you form the team that are going to be looking at this building.

641
01:00:21,067 --> 01:00:30,289
And so the DSP is the designer selection panel, which is an actual 13-member panel that the MSBA actually has.

642
01:00:30,869 --> 01:00:31,789
already assigned.

643
01:00:31,849 --> 01:00:41,591
It's a series of folks that have architectural engineering background, school background, all sort of all related to this.

644
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:45,452
They have a very rigid process as you mentioned.

645
01:00:45,932 --> 01:00:56,914
The designer RFS is basically it's a 12-page document where you can change the name of the school and the number of enrollment and the square footage that you currently have and that's about it.

646
01:00:57,938 --> 01:01:09,267
Um, MSBA is, is, is then in charge of reviewing that provided that you haven't made any changes to the document, uh, which is why we already started working on that in the background.

647
01:01:09,287 --> 01:01:19,476
And then they have monthly, they have two meetings every month where the first one is sort of a, a review process, uh, with that designer selection panel.

648
01:01:19,516 --> 01:01:23,219
And then you have three panel members from the district.

649
01:01:23,419 --> 01:01:27,302
So you have three from here and then 13 from the MSBA.

650
01:01:28,429 --> 01:01:35,593
So you then have the whole designer RFS process, which you have asked some questions about earlier.

651
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:41,355
So the key is that we want to try and get that out for advertisement as quickly as possible.

652
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:44,837
The MSBA has a certain review time that they require.

653
01:01:44,857 --> 01:01:50,360
I think it's 10 business days just to review that Word document that you can't really change.

654
01:01:51,035 --> 01:01:58,080
So there, that's when the clock starts taking right and then we we advertise central register only advertises on Wednesdays.

655
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:02,303
So now your, your timeline is is crunched a little bit further.

656
01:02:02,904 --> 01:02:08,788
But the way we've laid the schedule out is to literally the day after we're

657
01:02:09,561 --> 01:02:17,671
We've been blessed as the OPM for by the MSBA on that OPM panel, which we've done on every single project.

658
01:02:17,711 --> 01:02:18,693
Never had any issues.

659
01:02:18,853 --> 01:02:20,475
We're not anticipating any issues.

660
01:02:20,915 --> 01:02:21,756
I was just like today.

661
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:24,280
I was in the Bay's version today.

662
01:02:24,977 --> 01:02:25,597
Exactly.

663
01:02:26,397 --> 01:02:34,779
And so once we get through that, we'll be able to start helping with the designer selection process right away.

664
01:02:34,899 --> 01:02:43,580
So the RFS, we've already created the draft and sent it to Jenny to send it over to the MSBA so they can start their review time.

665
01:02:44,061 --> 01:02:44,941
We advertise.

666
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:48,021
It has to be out for advertisement for three weeks.

667
01:02:48,241 --> 01:02:51,402
We have to have a walkthrough for the design firms.

668
01:02:52,182 --> 01:03:05,785
they then submit their proposals and then left field has a series of reviews that we have to do for all the design firms that have submitted designer proposals.

669
01:03:07,065 --> 01:03:12,426
Most of those documents you'll see some examples in the little package that we gave here.

670
01:03:13,767 --> 01:03:20,108
Most of them are references and they do also ask us to fill out a long list of

671
01:03:20,959 --> 01:03:35,429
who the sub consultants are, which is where there'll be one for traffic, there'll be one for educational programming, there'll be one for hazmat material, one for geotech and all the different categories.

672
01:03:35,649 --> 01:03:44,776
And so what we will do is we will go through all these proposals and fill out all the required documents that then goes to the MSBA.

673
01:03:45,336 --> 01:03:46,177
The reason why

674
01:03:47,475 --> 01:03:51,466
The timeline is so tight because once we get all those proposals submitted.

675
01:03:52,178 --> 01:03:56,062
We then have to turn this around and send it to the MSBA very, very quickly.

676
01:03:56,142 --> 01:04:09,654
So I think we've allotted actually a week to just get all that information over to the MSBA, because they will not put you in the district on the list of those upcoming meetings unless they have all this documentation in hand.

677
01:04:09,674 --> 01:04:15,880
And I think one of the things that wasn't immediately clear to me about how different this is, is this panel of 13,

678
01:04:17,861 --> 01:04:23,142
will pick our designer and we have three seats at that table.

679
01:04:23,582 --> 01:04:27,743
The other 10 seats are MSBA seats.

680
01:04:27,923 --> 01:04:41,366
So people who don't live in Medford have no connection to us, but obviously have connections in the industry and are representatives of MSBA because they will play a significant financial role in all of this.

681
01:04:42,836 --> 01:04:48,978
they will have more votes than Medford does and who the designer ultimately is.

682
01:04:49,098 --> 01:04:59,342
So, and I think the other thing that wasn't clear to me necessarily like at the beginning because it is like a complete departure from what we just did, is that those three seats

683
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:05,284
for Medford are the mayor, the superintendent, and one designee from the school committee.

684
01:05:05,364 --> 01:05:09,826
So that is how the team gets formed from Medford's perspective.

685
01:05:10,847 --> 01:05:14,188
And then they are participants in this broader panel of 13.

686
01:05:16,629 --> 01:05:22,772
And the panel makes the decision about who our designer will ultimately be.

687
01:05:24,271 --> 01:05:26,432
and it's all numbers-based, right?

688
01:05:26,492 --> 01:05:35,555
So there's, at the end of each one of those two panel meetings, there'll be an actual vote where they just rank the proposals.

689
01:05:35,775 --> 01:05:53,141
So it's important for our team to review these documents and these proposals as they come in from the design firms to make sure that we give you guidance of who's done this before, who's got the right consultants, who's got the right team,

690
01:05:53,887 --> 01:05:59,771
What other projects are they working on or spending time on?

691
01:05:59,811 --> 01:06:02,352
Do they have the time and efforts?

692
01:06:03,373 --> 01:06:07,375
What is the experience level of their senior team?

693
01:06:07,555 --> 01:06:11,498
Or do they have a lot of people or fewer people on their team, et cetera?

694
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:21,904
All those things are up to us to give the guidance to the three members so that the members can go into this with a clear view of

695
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:27,103
who you like and who you'd like to be the finalists.

696
01:06:28,044 --> 01:06:29,124
That's the interview process.

697
01:06:29,505 --> 01:06:32,887
How does that RFPs get narrowed down to the shortlist for interviews?

698
01:06:32,907 --> 01:06:33,727
Is that the same 13?

699
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:34,388
Yeah.

700
01:06:34,808 --> 01:06:35,289
Yeah.

701
01:06:35,729 --> 01:06:36,950
So that's the first meeting.

702
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:39,852
So we have two meetings in July that we're aiming for.

703
01:06:39,892 --> 01:06:44,195
So at the first one, they will just start ranking for interviews.

704
01:06:44,335 --> 01:06:49,898
And then the second meeting at the end of that month is when they actually have the actual interviews.

705
01:06:50,779 --> 01:06:52,000
Everything is done virtual.

706
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:55,553
with the MSBA, there's no in-person meetings anymore.

707
01:06:57,074 --> 01:06:58,936
But they will rank them.

708
01:06:59,756 --> 01:07:08,424
And if you don't have enough folks that actually submit proposals, which I don't see that as being an issue at all.

709
01:07:08,984 --> 01:07:11,807
We've already heard people that are showing interest.

710
01:07:13,148 --> 01:07:18,833
So I don't see that as being an issue, but definitely, as Jenny mentioned,

711
01:07:19,609 --> 01:07:21,350
you're three out of the 13.

712
01:07:22,111 --> 01:07:30,116
So there's a lot of opinions, but it's important to get the right design firm selected.

713
01:07:30,136 --> 01:07:34,519
Again, this is also at this point, just qualification based.

714
01:07:34,699 --> 01:07:41,964
So once they've designated the top ranked firm, you then go into contract negotiations.

715
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:48,909
And if they can't agree on a contract amount that fits the budget for the Medford High School project,

716
01:07:49,491 --> 01:07:55,975
you're allowed to go to the next, the second rank, but you have to go in the order of the firms that have been ranked.

717
01:07:56,175 --> 01:08:02,499
And yes, we just went through that on a different project where the top ranked firm just wouldn't budge.

718
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:08,583
And the district kind of felt like, this is not the team player that we wanna really work with.

719
01:08:09,183 --> 01:08:13,266
But again, it just, the process, the time, right?

720
01:08:14,287 --> 01:08:14,847
Philip?

721
01:08:15,187 --> 01:08:17,829
Are the meetings, the MSBA meetings, the committee meetings,

722
01:08:18,865 --> 01:08:20,846
public at all or only those 13 people in that?

723
01:08:20,926 --> 01:08:21,406
They're public.

724
01:08:21,426 --> 01:08:21,946
They're public.

725
01:08:22,006 --> 01:08:22,266
Yep.

726
01:08:23,386 --> 01:08:27,267
They're actually published on the MSBA project website.

727
01:08:27,767 --> 01:08:31,068
So you're welcome to attend even if Medford is not there.

728
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:32,788
There's no input though.

729
01:08:32,848 --> 01:08:33,649
No, yeah.

730
01:08:33,829 --> 01:08:35,349
Yeah, absolutely.

731
01:08:35,829 --> 01:08:36,069
Yep.

732
01:08:36,809 --> 01:08:37,149
Tracy?

733
01:08:37,529 --> 01:08:40,070
So Linda or Jim, thanks.

734
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:47,832
Is this part, what I'm trying to think about, what's wrong with it is that we only have three people from Medford.

735
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:55,680
In your experience other dealing with this, how have you related that to the community?

736
01:08:55,881 --> 01:09:09,327
Because it seems like it's going to be, you know, only three people from every get to decide who the designer is going to be seems kind of a huge, one of those FAQs that you've been talking about in terms of communicating with the community.

737
01:09:09,547 --> 01:09:09,767
Yeah.

738
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:22,109
One of the keys from that perspective where it's three versus the larger MSBA panel is they do ask your opinion first.

739
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:32,278
So you can kind of set the tone as to what you saw, what you thought about, and that kind of sets the tone in the room for what you're thinking.

740
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:35,922
And for the most part, they try to go along with that and they try to support that.

741
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:37,690
There are times they don't.

742
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:42,673
For example, if the architect we all love just won a job, guess what?

743
01:09:43,533 --> 01:09:51,397
The MSBA is probably not going to be as supportive because they try to make sure everyone's well balanced in terms of the design community.

744
01:09:52,678 --> 01:09:53,218
And we know that.

745
01:09:53,378 --> 01:10:00,121
We'll know the architects we're talking about in our deliberations may have just won a job.

746
01:10:00,141 --> 01:10:00,642
So we'll help.

747
01:10:01,733 --> 01:10:10,104
Inform the public and this committee specifically about what we know about the specific architects we're talking about who are proposed.

748
01:10:10,725 --> 01:10:18,215
You know, Libby, you'll know that, you know, also, are we looking for someone that is kind of more meat and potatoes architect that is going to

749
01:10:19,027 --> 01:10:27,591
just kind of give a design to budget, or are we looking for someone that's going to push the design edge, right, and give us something really exciting?

750
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:30,813
That sometimes reflects the personality of the committee we're dealing with.

751
01:10:31,554 --> 01:10:34,295
Sometimes people want to see, you know, a design push.

752
01:10:34,315 --> 01:10:38,417
Sometimes people want to see, you know, a very basic design that fits their budget needs.

753
01:10:38,457 --> 01:10:39,938
So we're going to learn a lot about you.

754
01:10:41,056 --> 01:10:50,861
We're going to help you talk, we're going to let you know what the personalities of the architects are, have they won a job, all the things that go into what the MSBA might be thinking.

755
01:10:50,881 --> 01:10:59,565
But I repeat myself, we at least have the chance to leave that meeting off and talk about what we saw, what we find, what we want, meaning Medford.

756
01:11:00,165 --> 01:11:03,187
And that does set the tone of the room.

757
01:11:04,242 --> 01:11:14,695
And I think just to also in sort of retrospect, the flip side of that conversation when you're talking to the public right, why didn't you have more of a, why doesn't Medford have more of a voice.

758
01:11:15,536 --> 01:11:22,444
I think the key point to highlight is MSBA is an organization, they are your funding partner.

759
01:11:23,351 --> 01:11:31,320
They have very strict guidelines that unfortunately if you've applied for this program, you're going to get some significant dollars from them.

760
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:36,566
And unfortunately, one of the drawbacks are that they have a very prescriptive process, right?

761
01:11:36,606 --> 01:11:40,951
So people are going to question timeframes, timelines, reimbursement.

762
01:11:41,667 --> 01:11:42,888
all those parts and pieces.

763
01:11:42,968 --> 01:11:55,196
And that's what we're here to help, to make sure that you get as much as possible of what Medford needs and wants, but still getting the maximum reimbursement from the MSBA.

764
01:11:55,616 --> 01:11:57,777
And that sort of goes throughout the whole process.

765
01:11:57,838 --> 01:12:07,144
But yes, there are some guidelines that they are very prescriptive with, because they do participate in a lot of money on these projects.

766
01:12:07,324 --> 01:12:10,626
So it's kind of a little bit of a give and take, I would say, in that aspect.

767
01:12:11,478 --> 01:12:29,522
The key point for us is always to make sure that the three members of the district that goes into this have a clear what they want, what the district wants, and have that information to be able to give that to the panel as you go into these meetings.

768
01:12:30,023 --> 01:12:31,363
That's going to be the key.

769
01:12:31,383 --> 01:12:37,284
And it's up to us to educate those members and the school building committee on those.

770
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:46,033
when we are going into our second meeting where the actual selection will happen.

771
01:12:46,922 --> 01:12:55,669
is it just us or are there gonna be people queued up just before us and they could literally choose the person that was our favorite like 10 minutes before we come on?

772
01:12:55,909 --> 01:12:56,650
Yeah, it's happening.

773
01:12:57,210 --> 01:13:04,896
Okay, so y'all gotta be prepared to change your minds in a second.

774
01:13:05,176 --> 01:13:12,122
Yeah, I think one thing to just keep in mind about this process is that like by the time we get to the point where we're selecting

775
01:13:12,962 --> 01:13:14,403
who's going to be the designer.

776
01:13:15,024 --> 01:13:16,705
Everybody is extremely qualified.

777
01:13:16,865 --> 01:13:19,788
Everybody, like all those firms are going to be very qualified.

778
01:13:20,148 --> 01:13:30,317
They all have passed like the rigorous requirements to even get to that point so that like you know it's kind of sticks of one half dozen of the other at the end of the day.

779
01:13:31,117 --> 01:13:37,483
Obviously we're all going to have our preference of who we wanted to be but like we as a community might not even all agree on that one

780
01:13:38,143 --> 01:13:39,404
awesome one is going to be.

781
01:13:39,944 --> 01:13:52,250
And then just separately another talking point that I think can help bring people along in the process about us not having or Medford as a community not having as big a say in the whole thing is that we have never done this before.

782
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:56,472
Like we don't have the expertise, the MSBA has the expertise.

783
01:13:56,933 --> 01:14:07,418
They're the ones who we're like bringing along as our partner to help us guide us through this process to make sure that we get the best design and the best building, the best project that we can get out of it at the end of the day.

784
01:14:10,224 --> 01:14:10,384
Okay.

785
01:14:11,286 --> 01:14:22,044
Well, you know, it's very interesting examples where the FDA offered to readjust their reimbursement rate based on the cost of the project.

786
01:14:22,064 --> 01:14:22,765
In the worst case,

787
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:26,742
They offer a reimbursement rate, say, of 50%.

788
01:14:26,782 --> 01:14:39,048
When the project is finalized, the cost of 50% will exceed their MSBA's appetite for reimbursement, so they're going to adjust that.

789
01:14:39,488 --> 01:14:41,809
And you can encounter examples of that.

790
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:46,354
The short answer is yes, and that is going to happen.

791
01:14:47,634 --> 01:14:54,975
And stay tuned for the 10-page presentation on MSBA reimbursements, how it works, what's to come.

792
01:14:56,536 --> 01:15:05,778
It's a series of, in short terms, they give you a reimbursement rate on day one, which is only applicable to the feasibility study.

793
01:15:06,658 --> 01:15:12,519
After that, when it comes to your actual project reimbursement, there's an entirely

794
01:15:12,952 --> 01:15:14,132
different scenario.

795
01:15:14,172 --> 01:15:28,657
They start with that same percentage, yes, but then there's a series of caps for construction, for site work, for ineligible items such as pools and other items that they deem ineligible.

796
01:15:28,837 --> 01:15:36,599
So it's our job and the designer's job to make sure that from the beginning when you start the design of that building

797
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:41,622
figuring out weighing those options, right?

798
01:15:42,183 --> 01:15:47,326
What's going to be the most beneficial to Medford and the students and the faculty?

799
01:15:47,907 --> 01:15:52,890
And yes, that might mean that MSBA's reimbursement rate is going to go down.

800
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:56,493
There will be items that they're not going to reimburse you on.

801
01:15:57,554 --> 01:16:02,097
And that is a very long, very complex process.

802
01:16:03,037 --> 01:16:06,240
But in short, by the time you finish the feasibility study,

803
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:18,224
You then sign the project funding agreement with the MSBA, which is what leads the project to move forward into actual design, final design and construction.

804
01:16:19,004 --> 01:16:26,087
And at that point, you will have their, what they refer to as their final offer and you will know going into that next step.

805
01:16:26,716 --> 01:16:36,862
what their reimbursement is going to be, provided that, of course, you don't make changes during construction and start shifting things, because then, again, that reimbursement is going to start shifting.

806
01:16:37,782 --> 01:16:38,943
But more to come on that.

807
01:16:39,263 --> 01:16:47,447
Lots of lengthy, very complex calculations, and you will love to see the spreadsheet that we refer to as the 3011.

808
01:16:49,761 --> 01:16:51,882
Yeah, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves here, right?

809
01:16:51,902 --> 01:16:56,203
This is an introduction, but we're going to have meetings on the designer selection process.

810
01:16:56,223 --> 01:16:59,664
We're going to have meetings on eligibility and funding.

811
01:16:59,724 --> 01:17:04,826
We're going to have meetings on, you know, CM at risk versus lump sum, the design, the build.

812
01:17:05,486 --> 01:17:08,828
So, you know, that's where the community engagement comes in.

813
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:11,491
there'll be lots of meetings.

814
01:17:12,652 --> 01:17:15,334
And this is, again, this is just the beginning.

815
01:17:15,394 --> 01:17:17,236
This is just the feasibility study.

816
01:17:18,357 --> 01:17:32,350
And so I think it's important to know also going back to the designer selection and that whole process is that the contract that you're signing, that you're negotiating with that design firm is only for the feasibility study.

817
01:17:32,923 --> 01:17:48,997
At the end of that, once you have schematic design is finished and the project is sort of finalized to a certain extent, then the OPM and the design firm will give you proposals as well as the CM if you have one on board.

818
01:17:49,017 --> 01:17:54,322
And that'll be part of the project budget moving forward.

819
01:17:54,722 --> 01:17:59,046
But everything that we're doing right now is only through feasibility study.

820
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:02,270
Erica, did I see your hand in the back?

821
01:18:02,571 --> 01:18:19,667
Yeah, I was wondering if you could speak to how unique this process is for schools in particular, because I think to Tracy's point about community questions about why did it happen this way, and people's reference point is likely other construction projects that they've been involved in.

822
01:18:20,567 --> 01:18:25,112
And so is this typical across building projects, or is this really

823
01:18:26,059 --> 01:18:28,561
a singular experience for the MSBA process.

824
01:18:28,581 --> 01:18:33,564
Maybe Marissa can answer that.

825
01:18:34,344 --> 01:18:36,405
When my work was rebuilt, this happened.

826
01:18:36,465 --> 01:18:39,847
And this is what is going to be inundated.

827
01:18:39,907 --> 01:18:43,670
And so I'm curious if you can, in a nutshell,

828
01:18:44,973 --> 01:18:47,715
This is MSBA.

829
01:18:47,815 --> 01:18:50,436
The specialty part has four letters in it.

830
01:18:50,616 --> 01:18:51,557
It's MSBA.

831
01:18:52,817 --> 01:18:59,881
MSBA's process is a series of modules with very prescriptive forms that have to be filled out.

832
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:02,582
They have scheduled dates for their meetings.

833
01:19:02,722 --> 01:19:12,708
You'll have to go through different steps of meetings, all that are very prescriptive, all public meetings, but they've already published the dates for the entire year of 2025.

834
01:19:14,302 --> 01:19:17,445
So we already know that the good part is we already know.

835
01:19:17,985 --> 01:19:19,447
So we can start planning ahead.

836
01:19:19,467 --> 01:19:28,375
The bad part is that we don't know what's going to happen in 2026 but fortunately for us, the MSBA is very rigorous and very restrictive.

837
01:19:28,856 --> 01:19:36,603
We already know, we can sort of guess what the dates are going to be in 2026 because we know that they take a break in February and there are no board meetings.

838
01:19:38,622 --> 01:19:38,982
in March.

839
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:49,826
So you have a series of different panels and committees that you deal with throughout the umbrella of the MSVA.

840
01:19:50,267 --> 01:19:54,789
And this, I believe, is very unique for any public work.

841
01:19:54,809 --> 01:20:03,352
We do a lot of municipal projects with libraries and town hall and fire departments and public safeties.

842
01:20:03,432 --> 01:20:04,413
And we work on public

843
01:20:05,602 --> 01:20:10,924
colleges with some of the authorities we talked about, but it's very different.

844
01:20:10,944 --> 01:20:11,244
You're right.

845
01:20:11,284 --> 01:20:12,905
This process is unique to all of us.

846
01:20:13,725 --> 01:20:15,546
As Linda keeps using it, it's true.

847
01:20:15,606 --> 01:20:16,467
It's like a black box.

848
01:20:16,527 --> 01:20:18,588
It's very prescriptive on how we move forward.

849
01:20:19,208 --> 01:20:23,810
And we're going to follow along with those rules with you and educate this team as we go.

850
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:25,390
Thank you.

851
01:20:25,611 --> 01:20:25,951
You're welcome.

852
01:20:27,651 --> 01:20:31,013
Any other questions about anything you've heard so far?

853
01:20:33,481 --> 01:20:37,307
So you all should have received the marked up copy of

854
01:20:38,575 --> 01:20:48,297
the RFS that we ultimately need to prepare to send to MSBA to get that designer selection out on the street.

855
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:52,578
A couple of notes about it.

856
01:20:52,998 --> 01:20:57,119
As Linda said, there's very little opportunity to change anything.

857
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:01,260
And if you change something, they will tell you to change it back.

858
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,661
But any place that

859
01:21:05,571 --> 01:21:09,253
was for us to infuse information about Medford.

860
01:21:09,753 --> 01:21:21,119
All of that information is practically identical to what was published in our RFS to hire the OPM, which has already been vetted and approved by the MSBA.

861
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:33,566
So this came together so quickly because Matt is dedicated to our project, but also because he had lots of good material to work with to actually sort of infuse

862
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:36,547
the Medford specifics into this document.

863
01:21:36,627 --> 01:21:46,130
So having said all of that, changes are welcome, as long as you're not asking me to change something that MSBA doesn't allow us to change.

864
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:54,613
But I did want to ask this group, as you review this, do you have questions or things you would like to see us tweak in here?

865
01:21:56,313 --> 01:22:01,435
And or are you ready to take a vote to approve?

866
01:22:01,455 --> 01:22:02,355
So first questions.

867
01:22:04,538 --> 01:22:09,359
So the only question I have is that it seems like everything's prescriptive, and I've read the most of it.

868
01:22:09,439 --> 01:22:10,180
It's mostly fine.

869
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:17,762
It's really on the timeline of the issuing out the RFS and then the selection, right, in three weeks.

870
01:22:18,242 --> 01:22:23,383
So we talked about the importance of hiring the right designer, and there's really not much else to control.

871
01:22:23,623 --> 01:22:26,044
But that is something to control, to make the timeline.

872
01:22:26,404 --> 01:22:28,905
Is that enough time for designers to

873
01:22:29,745 --> 01:22:38,335
Evaluate all the information, the uniqueness of the site, the constraints that we have to pull together a strong proposal so that we can.

874
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:41,298
That they understand what the project is, right?

875
01:22:41,318 --> 01:22:42,039
3 weeks teams.

876
01:22:42,579 --> 01:22:46,744
These designers are also going to be doing the full time job designing buildings or whatever they're doing.

877
01:22:46,824 --> 01:22:48,526
So they're going to be getting these proposals in.

878
01:22:50,957 --> 01:22:52,158
and as an extra, right?

879
01:22:52,178 --> 01:22:54,619
So the three weeks just seem to compress things.

880
01:22:54,719 --> 01:23:06,387
I know that we're trying to meet a deadline, but I also think that if we make the wrong selection, it hurts the company even more, because you want to find the right designer to get through the schematic, and then hopefully they're good enough where they're going to go through the entire thing.

881
01:23:06,407 --> 01:23:09,268
You don't want to change designers after that, right?

882
01:23:09,368 --> 01:23:12,790
So we allowed the OPMs three weeks.

883
01:23:13,111 --> 01:23:16,373
So we provided the same quick timeline.

884
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:19,796
and we had 10 respondents.

885
01:23:20,457 --> 01:23:27,045
I believe there were probably some architects in the like ether during our

886
01:23:27,555 --> 01:23:28,436
during our tour.

887
01:23:28,456 --> 01:23:32,919
I don't know who they were, but they're already here.

888
01:23:32,959 --> 01:23:34,981
They're watching our meetings and all of that good stuff.

889
01:23:36,242 --> 01:23:41,526
And when I told the MSBA that we had 10 respondents, they were like, wow.

890
01:23:41,626 --> 01:23:46,710
So that even seemed like a lot of interest to what they typically see.

891
01:23:47,351 --> 01:23:49,032
So I think the three weeks

892
01:23:49,695 --> 01:23:53,216
didn't harm us in the OPM selection process.

893
01:23:53,256 --> 01:23:55,537
So that's like the data point I can share.

894
01:23:56,438 --> 01:23:59,479
But you all might have some other data to share.

895
01:23:59,599 --> 01:23:59,839
Yeah.

896
01:24:00,199 --> 01:24:00,579
May I?

897
01:24:00,919 --> 01:24:01,840
Yeah.

898
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:08,222
Sitting on the other side of that table, the good part is that the RFS is very prescriptive.

899
01:24:09,537 --> 01:24:12,018
The good news is that's very prescriptive.

900
01:24:12,078 --> 01:24:28,765
So if they've applied, if they work on MSBA projects, which most likely all these designers have, and you will want somebody that has been working on previous MSBA projects, they've got all that data already pulled together, because the RFS asks for points in specific.

901
01:24:28,845 --> 01:24:31,486
But I'm working on specific, so I would like to see a proposal that

902
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:40,645
designers look and come up with some, you know, some good ideas on the site and stuff like that.

903
01:24:40,705 --> 01:24:43,808
I'm just wondering if that's enough time to allow that to happen, you know.

904
01:24:44,848 --> 01:24:47,110
So it's an excellent question.

905
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:47,871
Yeah.

906
01:24:48,051 --> 01:24:49,793
And there is.

907
01:24:49,873 --> 01:24:55,497
There's also the other part of the RFS is that they're limited to the number of things that they can submit.

908
01:24:56,218 --> 01:24:59,501
And they have to submit certain things that are part of that RFS.

909
01:24:59,541 --> 01:25:01,763
And it keeps, I know it sounds like a broken record, but

910
01:25:02,902 --> 01:25:10,807
That's really the only piece that they're really going to focus on is the network specific, how they stand out to the other firms.

911
01:25:10,887 --> 01:25:15,510
Because the rest of it, 98% of that response is so prescriptive.

912
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:18,071
They already have everything out.

913
01:25:18,111 --> 01:25:22,774
They already know what they're going to be focusing on.

914
01:25:23,074 --> 01:25:27,997
And most of them have already started focusing on that.

915
01:25:28,037 --> 01:25:30,498
That's why they attend the OPM walks and meetings.

916
01:25:33,488 --> 01:25:40,454
They scour the MSBA news just to learn more about each project, each district.

917
01:25:41,535 --> 01:25:50,203
And three weeks is actually, in response to some of the processes that we have to go through, three weeks is actually generous.

918
01:25:51,404 --> 01:25:52,825
I think it's great for a question.

919
01:25:53,346 --> 01:25:53,666
Yeah.

920
01:25:54,227 --> 01:25:57,490
I thought that they might want to respond.

921
01:26:01,867 --> 01:26:11,073
I agree with Thomas, but I also agree with Linda that I think a lot of people working on it now, a lot of them know the responses they need to do, so it's how do they, to your point, deal with the specific side issues.

922
01:26:11,714 --> 01:26:15,596
And I think three weeks might be enough for them to deal with that.

923
01:26:15,617 --> 01:26:18,218
But again, it's a very, very good question.

924
01:26:18,939 --> 01:26:24,503
Also, one of the things I was surprised when we were doing the finalists was, and I forget which group,

925
01:26:25,562 --> 01:26:30,515
Maybe it was two of the three groups, but they're like, oh, we've been planning for this project for a year now, watching all your meetings.

926
01:26:30,976 --> 01:26:33,562
So that was a surprise to me.

927
01:26:35,738 --> 01:26:44,221
I guess it shouldn't have been a surprise, but it was a surprise that when we issue the RFS or the RFP or whatever, that's not when people find out about this.

928
01:26:44,321 --> 01:26:50,264
If that's when they found out, they probably weren't who we wanted anyways because they were not paying enough attention.

929
01:26:50,884 --> 01:27:00,248
If we were putting this on a square piece of land like in Revere, you could probably get away with a lot, but this is not.

930
01:27:03,574 --> 01:27:06,416
So the first thing is the shortlist.

931
01:27:06,976 --> 01:27:17,984
The second thing is that when that shortlist takes what they know and they have to create an interview, right, and they have a lot of specifics around the site, kind of a presentation, and they spent a lot of money, and they have been spending a lot of time thinking about this.

932
01:27:18,044 --> 01:27:24,428
But it's really the time on that second interview piece that is the right time for them to do that correctly.

933
01:27:26,969 --> 01:27:27,910
Other questions, Luke?

934
01:27:30,972 --> 01:27:32,033
So I can't.

935
01:27:33,167 --> 01:27:34,748
I'm going to save it at least for the last minute.

936
01:27:35,508 --> 01:27:44,591
So if any one of us went to a real estate broker and said, our range is from half a million dollars to $2 million.

937
01:27:45,351 --> 01:27:47,252
I'm looking for a house.

938
01:27:47,452 --> 01:27:51,273
Common Sense tells us that we should be able to see a lot of $2 million houses.

939
01:27:52,854 --> 01:27:58,036
Our RFS, both for OPM and designer,

940
01:27:59,952 --> 01:28:02,894
in states of range from 200 to 600 million.

941
01:28:02,994 --> 01:28:11,621
On the low end of the range, Stoneman built a school for around $200 million, gave it half the student population.

942
01:28:11,941 --> 01:28:15,184
For us, there would be a low frills fund.

943
01:28:16,325 --> 01:28:23,550
On the high end, at $600 million, he would be signing up for the most expensive high school in the country.

944
01:28:26,307 --> 01:28:38,393
And I think that our reimbursement rate would be effective for something that much higher than what I see it being.

945
01:28:38,913 --> 01:28:43,735
Walk-in school costs around $400 million.

946
01:28:43,755 --> 01:28:44,476
That was our school.

947
01:28:45,276 --> 01:28:46,177
That was your school.

948
01:28:46,377 --> 01:28:52,700
And in fact, I'll also say that Madison Park is probably going to come up with a $600 or $700 million range.

949
01:28:54,019 --> 01:28:57,760
Another project we're doing, Brockton, is going to be probably north of 6.

950
01:28:58,021 --> 01:29:04,623
So there are other projects out there in the Commonwealth that are going to be in that range.

951
01:29:05,103 --> 01:29:05,803
But I agree with you.

952
01:29:05,863 --> 01:29:14,246
I think it's all going to be based on enrollment, because enrollment's going to set the size of the school, and then it's going to be about the Chapter 74 programs we choose.

953
01:29:14,966 --> 01:29:17,447
So those will all kind of set the square footage, and from there,

954
01:29:18,235 --> 01:29:21,257
we can determine what the, you know, what the cost might be based on this information.

955
01:29:21,277 --> 01:29:24,699
Because we have a lot of data with that, and the MSBA has a lot of data with that.

956
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:46,133
And Luke, based on your same question from the last RFS, I had a conversation with MSBA about that range, and we talked about the intention being that we don't know what this project exactly is, whether we're staying here, whether we're renovating, whether we're building something completely new, and so the range,

957
01:29:46,757 --> 01:29:54,323
was intended to reflect sort of our willingness and openness to hear what the options are.

958
01:29:54,963 --> 01:29:59,847
And the MSBA was completely satisfied with that answer and we moved right along.

959
01:30:00,167 --> 01:30:05,351
So I don't think that designers and, like you all saw that same number.

960
01:30:06,051 --> 01:30:13,177
I hope that's what it said to you, but that certainly was the impression of everybody who came through the tour was like,

961
01:30:13,877 --> 01:30:16,399
Yeah, there's a lot of things that could happen here.

962
01:30:16,699 --> 01:30:24,385
That's partly why it's so desirable, based on what people are telling us in these in the walkthroughs, like people are

963
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:33,225
salivating over this project because there's like something for literally everybody like, oh, if you like a tight site, we've got that.

964
01:30:33,305 --> 01:30:37,027
If you like a site that's surrounded by wetlands, we've got that.

965
01:30:37,107 --> 01:30:42,610
Like if you are like a logistics moving expert, this is the place for you.

966
01:30:42,690 --> 01:30:46,392
Like there's just something really, and you know, we have one egress.

967
01:30:46,412 --> 01:30:48,794
We have all these things that are like really appealing.

968
01:30:48,974 --> 01:30:53,777
So I think that that didn't, you know, we didn't get a single question about that.

969
01:30:54,577 --> 01:31:03,860
And so my question is, do we have the opportunity to adjust the upper bound of our zoning for this upcoming bar test?

970
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,301
I think the question is, why would we do that?

971
01:31:07,741 --> 01:31:10,062
Well, the response would be for the sticker shock test.

972
01:31:11,523 --> 01:31:12,463
Sticker shock to who?

973
01:31:13,483 --> 01:31:17,445
To the people who are going to be seeing tax increases.

974
01:31:19,125 --> 01:31:21,106
We aren't asking for tax increases right now.

975
01:31:22,931 --> 01:31:24,892
I think that's a matter of opinion.

976
01:31:25,373 --> 01:31:29,635
So if you would like to make a motion, we can vote on it.

977
01:31:29,655 --> 01:31:30,556
But that's up to you.

978
01:31:53,142 --> 01:32:02,108
Okay, so there's a motion on the floor by Luke to adjust the upper bound to $400 million.

979
01:32:17,193 --> 01:32:23,678
So if you adjust it to $400 million, and you do this betting or whatever, and an estimate is common, there's different alternatives.

980
01:32:23,718 --> 01:32:25,539
But one of the alternatives is over $400 million.

981
01:32:25,559 --> 01:32:28,461
Does that take the alternative out if you can't even because it's out of your range?

982
01:32:29,182 --> 01:32:29,422
No.

983
01:32:30,122 --> 01:32:36,747
I think there are guidelines in the NFS, the weather could go higher or lower than those guidelines.

984
01:32:36,947 --> 01:32:39,589
What it's really made for, I believe, what the range does is it

985
01:32:44,039 --> 01:32:45,500
So there is a motion on the floor.

986
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,340
Is there a second?

987
01:33:14,918 --> 01:33:15,459
through the chair.

988
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:17,000
Mayor?

989
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:19,262
I couldn't hear Luke.

990
01:33:19,322 --> 01:33:22,485
I couldn't hear Luke.

991
01:33:22,505 --> 01:33:26,088
So what is the motion to not exceed $400 million?

992
01:33:26,748 --> 01:33:35,896
The motion is to change the language in the RFS so that the upper number in the RFS is $400 million instead of $600 million.

993
01:33:36,997 --> 01:33:39,219
It's just about what is being published in the RFS.

994
01:33:45,130 --> 01:33:45,830
What was that, Mayor?

995
01:33:48,271 --> 01:34:01,234
To left field, just so I can, I mean, I've been paying attention, but when you said Brockton was more along the lines of 600 million, how many students is that comparable to the number we have certified?

996
01:34:01,254 --> 01:34:04,295
Quite a bit more, probably could be even double.

997
01:34:06,235 --> 01:34:06,455
Yeah.

998
01:34:08,015 --> 01:34:09,876
Over here is 500, close to 500 million.

999
01:34:09,896 --> 01:34:10,036
Yeah.

1000
01:34:18,376 --> 01:34:21,057
I think it's 1450.

1001
01:34:21,117 --> 01:34:25,199
So that's about the same as our design enrollment.

1002
01:34:25,399 --> 01:34:25,579
Yep.

1003
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:27,620
And that's in 497.

1004
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:28,761
Yeah.

1005
01:34:31,422 --> 01:34:32,922
What's going to happen with the site, right?

1006
01:34:32,962 --> 01:34:34,843
There's a lot that's going to go into this that we don't know yet.

1007
01:34:35,263 --> 01:34:37,104
I think there's a number of limits on us.

1008
01:34:37,244 --> 01:34:37,584
What's that?

1009
01:34:37,605 --> 01:34:39,505
I don't think this is the time to put limits on us.

1010
01:34:39,725 --> 01:34:40,726
It's like, keep it open.

1011
01:34:41,482 --> 01:34:46,624
And certainly, I'm sure costs will be carefully scrutinized.

1012
01:34:51,627 --> 01:35:02,552
MSBA will definitely, we have a $600 million project, the MSBA says that doesn't match your enrollment, or it might include things they're not even reimbursing us for, like a new pool or administrative offices.

1013
01:35:02,692 --> 01:35:04,693
I'm sure we'll be looking at that carefully.

1014
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:18,683
as Jim says, it guides you to the capacity and experience of the architectural firm, right?

1015
01:35:19,304 --> 01:35:30,572
If you put it too low, you run the risk of getting firms that are smaller, that are used to designing elementary schools, that are in the 50 to 150 range, right?

1016
01:35:30,672 --> 01:35:33,795
So the numbers in the RFS

1017
01:35:34,328 --> 01:35:40,490
for us, and we take it the same way, is just a guidance of the size of the project.

1018
01:35:40,530 --> 01:35:42,670
Because like you said, it comes down to the enrollment.

1019
01:35:42,711 --> 01:35:44,851
It comes down to so many different parts and pieces.

1020
01:35:46,072 --> 01:35:50,373
I'm going to agree that probably 600 is too high based on where I think we might come in.

1021
01:35:50,973 --> 01:35:53,074
But would I change anything yet?

1022
01:35:53,094 --> 01:35:53,574
Probably not.

1023
01:35:53,834 --> 01:35:55,054
That's probably where I could balance.

1024
01:35:57,155 --> 01:35:57,935
Can I ask a question?

1025
01:35:58,255 --> 01:35:58,375
Sure.

1026
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:10,253
I've only paid enough attention to know that sometimes the MSBA, because inflation will be generous and make adjustments.

1027
01:36:13,754 --> 01:36:16,695
But that's assuming the economy is doing okay.

1028
01:36:18,196 --> 01:36:24,418
So, if inflation, we saw a chart, I don't know whose chart it was.

1029
01:36:24,438 --> 01:36:25,979
13, 14, 15%, a year increase.

1030
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:38,284
you know, if we do see them at risk, we're gonna call the number and that's gonna be the number.

1031
01:36:39,404 --> 01:36:41,706
And that's great.

1032
01:36:41,966 --> 01:36:48,291
But until we've gotten to that point, we have no idea what that inflation, that's not in a year.

1033
01:36:49,331 --> 01:36:50,452
We're not doing that in a year.

1034
01:36:51,033 --> 01:36:56,817
So if we look at another 15 or more percent increase between now and then,

1035
01:36:58,243 --> 01:37:01,027
That's a lot of money.

1036
01:37:01,668 --> 01:37:05,292
And so I'm concerned that if we set a number too low,

1037
01:37:06,634 --> 01:37:12,297
things go up 25%, which by the way, is not unimaginable in this weird world we live in right now.

1038
01:37:12,757 --> 01:37:16,420
We will not, we will instead just be deciding which programs we're cutting.

1039
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:17,240
That's what we'll do.

1040
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:22,663
That is the only path that will go forward is we will just decide we're gonna skip this vocational program.

1041
01:37:23,083 --> 01:37:27,446
We're gonna stop having before and after preschool in the building or whatever.

1042
01:37:27,466 --> 01:37:31,568
Theater, it's tiny or theater.

1043
01:37:33,749 --> 01:37:34,830
Where are towers gonna take us?

1044
01:37:35,257 --> 01:37:36,437
Well, yeah, I have no idea.

1045
01:37:36,457 --> 01:37:38,558
I would love to know.

1046
01:37:39,118 --> 01:37:56,185
So that's my concern is that I don't, a $600 million project today, like if it was just built right this second, is not an appropriate project for Medford's size or its, you know, financial demographics.

1047
01:37:58,134 --> 01:38:00,276
But what does it look like in five years?

1048
01:38:00,976 --> 01:38:03,118
Or four years, three years?

1049
01:38:03,899 --> 01:38:05,800
Whatever number makes baby happy.

1050
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:15,828
It's just unimaginable because I think that it's like, if you had told me we were paying $10 for a carton of eggs two or three years ago, I would have been like, you're a lunatic.

1051
01:38:18,596 --> 01:38:19,277
And here we are.

1052
01:38:19,457 --> 01:38:26,843
So I don't want us to like, get all the way through and stumble because we decided something what would have been two or three years ago.

1053
01:38:26,863 --> 01:38:33,989
And maybe we will get to that point, and it'll be $600 million and the voters will be like, we just can't do it.

1054
01:38:34,389 --> 01:38:35,610
And that's always an option.

1055
01:38:36,030 --> 01:38:39,353
But I'd rather they have the option to do that rather than to sell a project

1056
01:38:40,475 --> 01:38:42,435
This is exactly the process we go through, right?

1057
01:38:42,456 --> 01:38:49,297
They don't want options and making sure the numbers that marry those options and scope marries marriage budget.

1058
01:38:49,317 --> 01:38:50,798
So these are all things.

1059
01:38:51,158 --> 01:38:53,718
These are all the things we're going to contemplate over the next two years together.

1060
01:38:53,978 --> 01:39:05,521
Yeah, and every I will also say with 100% certainty that any number that we give to anyone for from a budget standpoint.

1061
01:39:06,401 --> 01:39:08,742
Is always calculated for the future,

1062
01:39:10,655 --> 01:39:16,182
In terms of your starting feasibility study right now, we have roughly 26 months for that.

1063
01:39:16,202 --> 01:39:19,446
So that's two years and then you're going to have another year of design.

1064
01:39:19,466 --> 01:39:26,595
And so most likely your project would not actually bid out for construction until late 27, 28, right?

1065
01:39:30,452 --> 01:39:47,482
And so every number that any of the design firms or any of us ever project or tell you is always going to have the dreaded word escalation in it, because we have to tell you, we're going to tell you what it's going to potentially cost to build this in 2028.

1066
01:39:49,088 --> 01:40:01,154
Not today, but on the flip side of that, what makes it very dangerous is when people go on the MSBA website and they look and they say, oh, this project was built for $150 million.

1067
01:40:01,575 --> 01:40:05,136
Well, that was in 2007 that it was bid out.

1068
01:40:05,276 --> 01:40:07,758
But because construction takes two, three, four years,

1069
01:40:08,884 --> 01:40:24,051
Things shift so it's very important, especially in a time like this with historical data as you saw in our chart in our proposal that there's huge drastic changes right now that have been happening in the last two to three years.

1070
01:40:25,092 --> 01:40:25,532
We are

1071
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,501
most likely never going to see them come down.

1072
01:40:29,101 --> 01:40:33,583
What we can see is hopefully some leveling out for various different reasons.

1073
01:40:33,643 --> 01:40:35,224
There's going to be some gives and takes.

1074
01:40:35,264 --> 01:40:37,105
Right now, everybody's all about the tariffs.

1075
01:40:37,205 --> 01:40:39,306
We don't know where the tariffs are going to be in three months.

1076
01:40:39,346 --> 01:40:40,187
They might go away.

1077
01:40:40,927 --> 01:40:43,948
But then on the flip side, the market right now is great for bidders.

1078
01:40:44,028 --> 01:40:45,489
And we've seen lower numbers come in.

1079
01:40:45,529 --> 01:40:49,491
So there's a lot of different things that are going to play into this.

1080
01:40:49,631 --> 01:40:53,733
But again, this is not something that's going to be determined

1081
01:40:54,503 --> 01:41:02,107
Today, or when you ask for proposals from the design firms, they're not in charge of that direction.

1082
01:41:02,247 --> 01:41:07,110
It is strictly just to give guidelines for what the project size could be.

1083
01:41:08,111 --> 01:41:10,112
Not that it should be or won't be.

1084
01:41:11,533 --> 01:41:12,633
Aaron, did you have your hand up?

1085
01:41:12,693 --> 01:41:15,255
Yeah, so when it comes to like

1086
01:41:26,202 --> 01:41:28,583
it's tough to navigate because of all the questions about tariffs.

1087
01:41:28,643 --> 01:41:41,005
And I think that even when you think about the political landscape and how there's such a flux and how things are going up and things are down, a lot of organizations at the federal level and state level are all holding onto their money because of the question marks that they're having.

1088
01:41:41,185 --> 01:41:45,386
I'm seeing this with the work that I do, where state funding and grant proposals and things like that.

1089
01:41:45,426 --> 01:41:48,487
But I've been doing some work on this.

1090
01:41:48,727 --> 01:41:52,948
Madison Technical Voc in the Roxbury neighborhood, there are about 1,200 kids or so by designation.

1091
01:41:57,706 --> 01:41:58,746
That's the current proposal.

1092
01:41:58,806 --> 01:42:00,928
So same thing with that.

1093
01:42:00,968 --> 01:42:02,529
That's a much bigger population.

1094
01:42:02,629 --> 01:42:07,012
It's like 23 2400 students, but they're looking at a 660 million bill.

1095
01:42:07,873 --> 01:42:09,954
So I think that like the cost of just randomly going up.

1096
01:42:10,034 --> 01:42:15,898
I do think that like obviously there are bills that are much cheaper for a higher student population, but they are going higher.

1097
01:42:15,918 --> 01:42:16,419
So I think to put a

1098
01:42:27,161 --> 01:42:33,366
amount of students are projected, but that limit feels like a bit of a quick decision this early on, personally.

1099
01:42:35,247 --> 01:42:35,507
Luke.

1100
01:42:35,788 --> 01:42:37,569
So Waltham is a great example.

1101
01:42:37,649 --> 01:42:39,911
I looked at Waltham's RFS's

1102
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:49,832
And they actually started lower bound when they initially sought out both VM and designers.

1103
01:42:50,372 --> 01:42:53,293
And then in the course of their project, things changed.

1104
01:42:53,373 --> 01:42:54,593
I think they changed the site.

1105
01:42:54,633 --> 01:42:57,034
They had some zoning issues.

1106
01:42:57,394 --> 01:42:59,754
And there was more blasting.

1107
01:42:59,774 --> 01:43:01,475
And so the price escalated.

1108
01:43:01,935 --> 01:43:05,376
And I think it ultimately topped out at like $380 million.

1109
01:43:05,576 --> 01:43:06,196
But their RFS range,

1110
01:43:10,217 --> 01:43:12,038
was much smaller than that.

1111
01:43:12,478 --> 01:43:17,760
They weren't talking about $1,200 in high school when they worked for designers and architects.

1112
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:24,362
I have it somewhere here in my computer, but it was like, what was it?

1113
01:43:24,422 --> 01:43:26,563
I think it was around a cap.

1114
01:43:26,643 --> 01:43:27,664
I'd have to look it up.

1115
01:43:27,724 --> 01:43:28,004
Right.

1116
01:43:28,344 --> 01:43:30,685
I think that's what the- So it can go the other way.

1117
01:43:30,805 --> 01:43:31,085
Right.

1118
01:43:31,245 --> 01:43:32,745
I think that's what some of the folks are saying here.

1119
01:43:32,885 --> 01:43:33,226
Oh, yeah.

1120
01:43:33,266 --> 01:43:33,486
Yeah.

1121
01:43:33,566 --> 01:43:34,126
And I hear them.

1122
01:43:34,826 --> 01:43:37,907
So there is a motion on the floor, but there is not a second.

1123
01:43:38,848 --> 01:43:39,568
Is there a second?

1124
01:43:43,197 --> 01:43:43,397
I'm sorry.

1125
01:43:43,417 --> 01:43:43,637
I'm sorry.

1126
01:43:43,918 --> 01:43:44,158
I'm sorry.

1127
01:43:44,178 --> 01:43:44,358
I'm sorry.

1128
01:43:44,378 --> 01:43:44,658
I'm sorry.

1129
01:43:45,158 --> 01:43:45,379
I'm sorry.

1130
01:43:45,399 --> 01:43:45,679
I'm sorry.

1131
01:43:45,699 --> 01:43:45,899
I'm sorry.

1132
01:43:45,919 --> 01:43:46,099
I'm sorry.

1133
01:43:46,119 --> 01:43:46,319
I'm sorry.

1134
01:43:46,339 --> 01:43:46,600
I'm sorry.

1135
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:46,820
I'm sorry.

1136
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:47,020
I'm sorry.

1137
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:47,860
I'm sorry.

1138
01:43:47,901 --> 01:43:48,141
I'm sorry.

1139
01:43:48,161 --> 01:43:48,441
I'm sorry.

1140
01:43:48,481 --> 01:43:48,761
I'm sorry.

1141
01:43:48,781 --> 01:43:49,001
I'm sorry.

1142
01:43:49,021 --> 01:43:49,201
I'm sorry.

1143
01:43:49,222 --> 01:43:49,442
I'm sorry.

1144
01:43:49,502 --> 01:43:49,962
I'm sorry.

1145
01:43:50,042 --> 01:43:50,903
I'm sorry.

1146
01:43:50,923 --> 01:43:51,203
I'm sorry.

1147
01:43:51,283 --> 01:43:51,463
I'm sorry.

1148
01:43:51,483 --> 01:43:51,723
I'm sorry.

1149
01:43:51,743 --> 01:43:51,964
I'm sorry.

1150
01:43:51,984 --> 01:43:53,084
I'm sorry.

1151
01:43:53,104 --> 01:43:54,025
I'm sorry.

1152
01:43:54,045 --> 01:43:54,606
I'm sorry.

1153
01:43:54,626 --> 01:43:54,866
I'm sorry.

1154
01:43:54,886 --> 01:43:55,346
I'm sorry.

1155
01:43:55,486 --> 01:43:56,087
I'm sorry.

1156
01:43:56,247 --> 01:43:57,107
I'm sorry.

1157
01:43:57,207 --> 01:43:57,468
I'm sorry.

1158
01:43:57,568 --> 01:43:57,808
I'm sorry.

1159
01:43:57,888 --> 01:43:58,188
I'm sorry.

1160
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:58,428
I'm sorry.

1161
01:43:58,488 --> 01:43:58,749
I'm sorry.

1162
01:43:58,769 --> 01:43:59,129
I'm sorry.

1163
01:43:59,149 --> 01:44:00,550
I'm sorry.

1164
01:44:00,850 --> 01:44:01,150
I'm sorry.

1165
01:44:01,170 --> 01:44:01,351
I'm sorry.

1166
01:44:01,371 --> 01:44:01,551
I'm sorry.

1167
01:44:01,571 --> 01:44:02,732
I'm sorry.

1168
01:44:02,752 --> 01:44:02,972
I'm sorry.

1169
01:44:02,992 --> 01:44:03,572
I'm sorry.

1170
01:44:03,592 --> 01:44:04,213
I'm sorry.

1171
01:44:04,233 --> 01:44:04,473
I'm sorry.

1172
01:44:04,493 --> 01:44:04,813
I'm sorry.

1173
01:44:04,833 --> 01:44:08,956
I'm sorry.

1174
01:44:09,977 --> 01:44:10,157
I'm sorry.

1175
01:44:10,177 --> 01:44:10,357
I'm sorry.

1176
01:44:10,377 --> 01:44:10,577
I'm sorry.

1177
01:44:10,597 --> 01:44:10,778
I'm sorry.

1178
01:44:10,798 --> 01:44:11,058
I'm sorry.

1179
01:44:11,098 --> 01:44:11,338
I'm sorry.

1180
01:44:15,181 --> 01:44:15,421
No.

1181
01:44:16,001 --> 01:44:16,161
No.

1182
01:44:17,722 --> 01:44:17,802
OK.

1183
01:44:17,842 --> 01:44:18,402
Dr. Galussi.

1184
01:44:18,642 --> 01:44:18,903
No.

1185
01:44:20,003 --> 01:44:20,723
Dr. Cushing.

1186
01:44:21,023 --> 01:44:21,264
No.

1187
01:44:22,104 --> 01:44:22,764
Marta Cabral.

1188
01:44:22,984 --> 01:44:23,184
No.

1189
01:44:23,985 --> 01:44:24,545
Libby Brown.

1190
01:44:25,025 --> 01:44:25,225
No.

1191
01:44:26,166 --> 01:44:27,006
Marissa Desmond.

1192
01:44:27,346 --> 01:44:27,566
No.

1193
01:44:28,106 --> 01:44:28,947
Maria Dorsey.

1194
01:44:29,287 --> 01:44:29,547
Yes.

1195
01:44:30,507 --> 01:44:31,328
Brian Hilliard.

1196
01:44:31,348 --> 01:44:31,868
No.

1197
01:44:32,548 --> 01:44:33,288
Tracy Keene.

1198
01:44:33,649 --> 01:44:33,829
No.

1199
01:44:34,809 --> 01:44:35,629
Emily Lozaro.

1200
01:44:35,910 --> 01:44:36,130
No.

1201
01:44:37,030 --> 01:44:37,730
Nicole Morrell.

1202
01:44:38,090 --> 01:44:38,291
No.

1203
01:44:39,031 --> 01:44:39,791
Erin Olopade.

1204
01:44:40,011 --> 01:44:40,191
No.

1205
01:44:40,852 --> 01:44:41,532
Luke Prisner.

1206
01:44:41,852 --> 01:44:42,052
Yes.

1207
01:44:42,672 --> 01:44:43,613
Joan Bowen.

1208
01:44:43,873 --> 01:44:43,953
No.

1209
01:44:45,295 --> 01:44:49,916
So that is two in the affirmative, 13 in the negative, motion fails.

1210
01:44:51,716 --> 01:44:52,016
OK.

1211
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:55,777
Are there other questions or comments about the RFS?

1212
01:44:56,577 --> 01:44:56,897
Maria?

1213
01:44:57,017 --> 01:45:00,578
I would just like to make a comment about that range, too.

1214
01:45:01,858 --> 01:45:08,319
I think when we go out into the community and try to sell this, that $600 million number is going to hurt.

1215
01:45:08,939 --> 01:45:12,320
I know when I first heard that we might bust $300 million, I gasped.

1216
01:45:14,943 --> 01:45:21,566
But I'm getting used to the numbers now after being here, talking about it, finding out what other communities have spent.

1217
01:45:22,827 --> 01:45:37,273
If there is the opportunity to have a number that won't scare people, because that's part of our job is going out there and selling the project to the community, then I like the idea of being able to give.

1218
01:45:37,313 --> 01:45:40,375
I think no matter what we do, those numbers are enormous.

1219
01:45:41,348 --> 01:45:47,195
I just think that it would be a little bit easier than 600 million to the people in Memphis.

1220
01:45:48,196 --> 01:45:52,361
So this is just about the RFS to get the designer on board.

1221
01:45:52,781 --> 01:45:59,228
Our communications team will help us with that, but we should not be saying this project will cost $600 million.

1222
01:45:59,509 --> 01:46:01,992
That's not the intention of that number at this time.

1223
01:46:03,294 --> 01:46:06,496
And so we can certainly, you know, people have questions about that.

1224
01:46:06,536 --> 01:46:08,197
We can certainly publish some FAQs.

1225
01:46:08,717 --> 01:46:13,479
This is, this is just part of the process, and it's a very, very early part of that process.

1226
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:19,982
Are there any other questions, comments, thoughts about the RFS, Bill?

1227
01:46:20,402 --> 01:46:21,643
Just one correction.

1228
01:46:21,803 --> 01:46:23,764
Sure.

1229
01:46:23,804 --> 01:46:26,245
The page 11, it says, July 31st.

1230
01:46:26,345 --> 01:46:28,886
The other schedule, I think that is the 13th.

1231
01:46:30,587 --> 01:46:31,528
So we'll align that.

1232
01:46:31,708 --> 01:46:32,248
Okay.

1233
01:46:38,203 --> 01:46:50,592
And these represent like the fastest possible scenario, which will be contingent on whether MSBA has space for us in those timelines and all of that.

1234
01:46:50,632 --> 01:46:54,155
So that timeline could change based on their feedback as well.

1235
01:46:55,756 --> 01:46:57,718
Are there other changes to the RFS?

1236
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:03,442
Is there a motion to approve the RFS as amended?

1237
01:47:05,352 --> 01:47:05,832
So moved.

1238
01:47:06,493 --> 01:47:07,593
By Dr. Galluzzi.

1239
01:47:07,613 --> 01:47:08,474
Is there a second?

1240
01:47:09,014 --> 01:47:09,154
Second.

1241
01:47:09,635 --> 01:47:10,855
By Marissa Desmond.

1242
01:47:11,556 --> 01:47:12,576
I will call the roll.

1243
01:47:13,737 --> 01:47:14,478
Jenny Graham.

1244
01:47:14,538 --> 01:47:14,898
Yes.

1245
01:47:15,238 --> 01:47:16,379
Mayor Lungo Kern.

1246
01:47:17,099 --> 01:47:17,419
Yes.

1247
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:18,940
Dr. Galluzzi.

1248
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:19,340
Yes.

1249
01:47:19,981 --> 01:47:20,721
Dr. Cushing.

1250
01:47:20,921 --> 01:47:21,222
Yes.

1251
01:47:21,622 --> 01:47:22,362
Marta Cabral.

1252
01:47:22,462 --> 01:47:22,702
Yes.

1253
01:47:22,863 --> 01:47:23,443
Libby Brown.

1254
01:47:23,603 --> 01:47:23,823
Yes.

1255
01:47:24,243 --> 01:47:25,024
Marissa Desmond.

1256
01:47:25,084 --> 01:47:25,304
Yes.

1257
01:47:25,564 --> 01:47:26,265
Maria Dorsey.

1258
01:47:26,465 --> 01:47:26,685
Yes.

1259
01:47:27,145 --> 01:47:27,886
Brian Hilliard.

1260
01:47:28,086 --> 01:47:28,286
Yes.

1261
01:47:28,906 --> 01:47:29,527
Tracy Keene.

1262
01:47:29,727 --> 01:47:29,967
Yes.

1263
01:47:30,527 --> 01:47:31,348
Emily Lazaro.

1264
01:47:31,448 --> 01:47:31,648
Yes.

1265
01:47:32,368 --> 01:47:33,049
Nicole Morrell.

1266
01:47:33,289 --> 01:47:33,469
Yes.

1267
01:47:34,163 --> 01:47:34,924
Aaron Olopade.

1268
01:47:34,964 --> 01:47:35,164
Yes.

1269
01:47:35,904 --> 01:47:36,565
Luke Preissner.

1270
01:47:36,585 --> 01:47:37,746
Abstain.

1271
01:47:39,968 --> 01:47:40,688
And Joan Bowen.

1272
01:47:40,949 --> 01:47:41,189
Yes.

1273
01:47:42,370 --> 01:47:45,892
So 14 in the affirmative, one abstention.

1274
01:47:46,113 --> 01:47:47,814
RFS is approved as amended.

1275
01:47:47,834 --> 01:47:49,555
Thank you.

1276
01:47:49,635 --> 01:47:55,660
So we will get that to MSBA and start working with them to try to get on the calendar as quickly as they will let us.

1277
01:47:57,982 --> 01:47:59,764
Because then the real exciting stuff happens.

1278
01:48:01,353 --> 01:48:02,834
Just doing a time check.

1279
01:48:03,074 --> 01:48:04,814
We're a few minutes before the end of the meeting.

1280
01:48:04,874 --> 01:48:07,875
Are there any other questions for our friends at left field here?

1281
01:48:08,655 --> 01:48:10,475
And if not, is there a motion to adjourn?

1282
01:48:11,796 --> 01:48:12,196
Questions?

1283
01:48:12,216 --> 01:48:16,157
I have one.

1284
01:48:16,537 --> 01:48:17,137
Sure.

1285
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:18,797
What is our timeline as a committee?

1286
01:48:19,658 --> 01:48:20,958
That is a great question.

1287
01:48:22,822 --> 01:48:24,323
I don't know the answer to that.

1288
01:48:24,383 --> 01:48:26,665
Maybe our left field friends can help us with that.

1289
01:48:27,086 --> 01:48:32,911
Can you give us a sense of what we should expect as a team in terms of meeting going forward?

1290
01:48:33,471 --> 01:48:33,692
Yes.

1291
01:48:34,592 --> 01:48:41,218
Typically, the school building committee meetings we generalize at once a month.

1292
01:48:41,458 --> 01:48:48,645
But going back to your question about capacity and flow, there will be times where

1293
01:48:49,422 --> 01:48:56,275
Uh, we might be able to go to twice a month or there might be times where we're waiting on something and we'll skip them.

1294
01:48:57,359 --> 01:49:19,022
um that is sort of generally speaking it's but there will be very specific dates that the msba has in their deadlines such as the designer selection panel so you will have to have those members assigned and to be adhering to that schedule that we have in our presentation and then there'll be

1295
01:49:19,663 --> 01:49:31,272
other dates where we have to match up approvals, because as a team, we won't ever submit anything to the MSBA unless it's been a formal vote by the school building committee.

1296
01:49:32,433 --> 01:49:36,796
Because we actually have to give the MSBA the meeting notes and the agendas and all those dates.

1297
01:49:37,436 --> 01:49:38,237
So there could be

1298
01:49:39,042 --> 01:49:51,852
dates where or months where if we have a big submission coming up we need the SPC's approval a couple of days prior to that to give the design team enough time to get it into the MSBA.

1299
01:49:51,892 --> 01:50:05,143
So those could fluctuate a little bit but generally speaking it's once a month and the beginning stages of once the designer is on board is that educational programming and that is very detailed

1300
01:50:06,368 --> 01:50:12,431
It's encouraged that as many people show up as possible, especially from the SBC group.

1301
01:50:13,391 --> 01:50:20,335
But that's going to be involving the faculty, the students, the community, parents, teachers, everyone.

1302
01:50:20,355 --> 01:50:25,677
And those, so those will sort of get interspersed in between that.

1303
01:50:26,498 --> 01:50:31,560
Once the designers on board, they come up with what they call a work plan.

1304
01:50:32,247 --> 01:50:40,893
which basically sort of lays out the next 20 to 24 months of what the deliverables are and what the meetings are going to be.

1305
01:50:40,933 --> 01:50:50,840
So that'll give you a really good idea of timeframes and frequency of all the different meetings, but we're going to be hanging out a lot.

1306
01:50:54,993 --> 01:51:00,776
If this selection goes as planned, do we need to vote on the third member?

1307
01:51:01,057 --> 01:51:03,578
And if so, is that going to be you?

1308
01:51:03,598 --> 01:51:05,899
Or should we go ahead and preempt it?

1309
01:51:06,199 --> 01:51:08,461
The school committee votes on that, is my understanding.

1310
01:51:08,501 --> 01:51:11,082
That's correct, the school committee, not the school building committee.

1311
01:51:11,242 --> 01:51:11,903
Is that correct?

1312
01:51:12,963 --> 01:51:16,325
I think it's been done by this body, but we'll check on that.

1313
01:51:16,385 --> 01:51:19,947
I think it's been done by this body, but we can get to that.

1314
01:51:19,967 --> 01:51:23,950
So my thought is, right after we hopefully get approved at the OPM panel,

1315
01:51:24,998 --> 01:51:34,580
we can then set up a meeting to get a little bit more into the designer selection process, talk about the voting of the three members, and then moving on.

1316
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:41,982
So that could be, we'll get a meeting set up, an agenda set out, all around the DSP process, and possibly vote for three members.

1317
01:51:42,302 --> 01:51:42,882
Okay, great.

1318
01:51:42,962 --> 01:51:46,563
And if the school committee needs to take action, I can give you- We will follow up on that.

1319
01:51:46,583 --> 01:51:49,824
We'll be okay in June, so we'll be good there.

1320
01:51:49,844 --> 01:51:54,045
Yeah, the key is we wanna make sure that it gives you enough time to have the DSP

1321
01:51:55,027 --> 01:52:03,477
members assigned and have them know exactly what their deliverables are to match those MSBA meetings.

1322
01:52:04,959 --> 01:52:12,047
But yeah, I don't believe that the school committee votes on anything for the MSBA other than enrollment questions.

1323
01:52:12,448 --> 01:52:13,289
We'll verify that.

1324
01:52:16,527 --> 01:52:17,388
is the DSP.

1325
01:52:17,728 --> 01:52:20,510
I know the DSP is the three folks that go and have their votes.

1326
01:52:20,830 --> 01:52:24,673
Are they the only ones who actually participate in doing this election?

1327
01:52:25,854 --> 01:52:26,075
Yes.

1328
01:52:26,175 --> 01:52:30,758
So if you get 30 respondents, only those three people are allowed to sit and do that work.

1329
01:52:30,778 --> 01:52:32,680
We'll talk about what happened

1330
01:52:33,834 --> 01:52:37,977
We can talk about what comes in as a group, what people saw, we can talk about that.

1331
01:52:38,678 --> 01:52:47,104
But the three people that are the ones that talk at the DSP, but we can talk as a group what the general committee liked and disliked about the respondents.

1332
01:52:47,665 --> 01:52:48,125
Oh, great.

1333
01:52:50,987 --> 01:52:52,508
We get 30 responses, we'll meet back.

1334
01:52:53,049 --> 01:52:54,830
Well, that's nice.

1335
01:52:55,050 --> 01:53:01,235
I mean, even the 10 responses, it's like if it's just, I mean, we added people because there's so much.

1336
01:53:01,535 --> 01:53:01,676
Yeah.

1337
01:53:03,531 --> 01:53:06,072
Are there any other questions from the group?

1338
01:53:09,214 --> 01:53:10,814
I assume this is confidential.

1339
01:53:11,115 --> 01:53:11,515
What's that?

1340
01:53:11,735 --> 01:53:13,676
I assume this is confidential.

1341
01:53:14,096 --> 01:53:24,761
It is a matter of public record, but if somebody would like a copy of that, you can ask them to send a records request, and we will share it that way until the contract is signed.

1342
01:53:27,113 --> 01:53:38,760
Okay, I'll call the roll.

1343
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:39,800

01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:40,861
