21
00:10:56,646 --> 00:11:04,310
[SPEAKER_28]: Be it resolved that we offer our deepest and sincerest condolences to the family of Brian Deeb Hilliard, a fixture in our community for almost 30 years.

22
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:12,054
[SPEAKER_28]: Brian was a uniquely talented trumpet player who turned his musical skills into a successful music booking agency, occasional brass and strings.

23
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:18,177
[SPEAKER_28]: We offer our sympathies to Brian's wife, Stacey, his children, Duncan and Owen, his extended family, and his many friends.

24
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:19,378
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Scarpelli.

25
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,126
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Mr. President.

26
00:11:23,326 --> 00:11:31,791
[SPEAKER_32]: I thank a fellow clerk that also was instrumental in getting this, putting this resolution forward.

27
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:45,040
[SPEAKER_32]: When you hear passing of members of our community and when they get to a certain age, you realize that you wish they lived a good life and they're moving on.

28
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:51,224
[SPEAKER_32]: But when you heard that Mr. Hilliard passed, it hit you right in the gut.

29
00:11:52,756 --> 00:12:06,039
[SPEAKER_32]: I've known him as a dad and as a resident, and everybody knew him as a giving musician, and everybody talks about his trumpet playing and the impact he's left in the music community.

30
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,820
[SPEAKER_32]: But more importantly, it's what he left back as a husband and a dad.

31
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:18,982
[SPEAKER_32]: Very close to my children's age, and Owen and Duncan, and it's something that

32
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:30,403
[SPEAKER_32]: We want to thank Brian for his commitment and love of Medford and his commitment to his family, his wife, Stacey.

33
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:44,547
[SPEAKER_32]: This is something that we've said it often when we lose some community members, but Brian Hillard's passing will definitely be forever missed.

34
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:49,269
[SPEAKER_32]: So I send the deepest condolences to Owen, Duncan, and Stacey.

35
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:57,158
[SPEAKER_32]: We, if we ever, if they ever need anything, we should be there for them.

36
00:12:57,198 --> 00:12:57,738
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you.

37
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,900
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Councilor Scarapelli.

38
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,580
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Tseng.

39
00:13:03,922 --> 00:13:08,846
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Councilor Scarapelli for putting this on the agenda and for your kind words.

40
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:16,291
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a difficult moment for the Hilliard family and I want to send my deepest condolences as well.

41
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:18,152
[SPEAKER_27]: I went to school at Duncan and

42
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:32,144
[SPEAKER_27]: It's tough to say anything because I think it hits particularly hard when it's a family of someone you know.

43
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:51,648
[SPEAKER_27]: I think I just want to send my best thoughts and recognize Mr. Hilliard's really wonderful life and legacy, his wonderful family.

44
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:55,629
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it's hard for me to gather my thoughts, too.

45
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:13,151
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, it does come as, you know, a shock to the community, especially, I think, I know a lot of us were at the Memorial Day event recently, and Mr. Hilliard played some really beautiful, moving music there.

46
00:14:13,472 --> 00:14:23,259
[SPEAKER_27]: And I just wanna, you know, say on the behalf of Benford City Council that we send our deepest condolences to the family.

47
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:26,361
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

48
00:14:26,401 --> 00:14:27,102
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Lazzaro.

49
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:39,718
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, I wanted to share that I heard about Mr. Hilliard's passing from the Medford Boat Club, sent out an email.

50
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:41,600
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a member of the boat club.

51
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:53,731
[SPEAKER_22]: He was a very active member and he organized the Hawaiian night and just his family was very active and continue to be very active.

52
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:54,791
[SPEAKER_22]: So on behalf of the,

53
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,381
[SPEAKER_22]: book club community, he'll be hugely missed.

54
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:03,524
[SPEAKER_22]: It's really a huge tragedy and I'm so sorry for his family and for the whole city.

55
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:09,628
[SPEAKER_22]: It's never easy and our hearts go up.

56
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:12,990
[SPEAKER_22]: So best wishes to his family.

57
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,752
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope they can get through this difficult time.

58
00:15:17,914 --> 00:15:18,274
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

59
00:15:18,294 --> 00:15:19,094
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Leming.

60
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:22,056
[SPEAKER_33]: I remember Mr. Hilliard,

61
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,919
[SPEAKER_33]: played at the Memorial Day Ceremony, the Patriots Day Ceremony.

62
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:35,521
[SPEAKER_33]: And this one, it kind of closed home for me because my dad, he's a professional trumpet player.

63
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:44,804
[SPEAKER_33]: And so anytime I see a trumpet player there representing the community, the musicians, I take note of them.

64
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:48,525
[SPEAKER_33]: Went up to Mr. Hilliard, had a conversation.

65
00:15:48,565 --> 00:15:50,966
[SPEAKER_33]: I wanted to get to know him better.

66
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:58,854
[SPEAKER_33]: So when I saw that, when I saw he passed away, it was a shock.

67
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:00,914
[SPEAKER_33]: Every community needs its musicians.

68
00:16:01,654 --> 00:16:06,116
[SPEAKER_33]: Every community needs people there to play taps.

69
00:16:06,276 --> 00:16:13,058
[SPEAKER_33]: Every community needs music and without Mr. Hilliard, Medford's lost that.

70
00:16:14,638 --> 00:16:21,440
[SPEAKER_33]: So my condolences to his family and thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this resolution.

71
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:24,594
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

72
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:28,157
[SPEAKER_28]: It looks like we do have one comment from a member of the public.

73
00:16:29,798 --> 00:16:33,041
[SPEAKER_28]: I recognize Bill Giglio, you have three minutes.

74
00:16:33,341 --> 00:16:37,845
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

75
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:39,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank George also for putting this on.

76
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:42,349
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very deeply saddening.

77
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:51,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I met Ryan when my, when our oldest boy started kindergarten and our youngest boys went to kindergarten together and they played sports.

78
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:55,212
[SPEAKER_02]: everything and I knew them throughout the years and they're just a great film.

79
00:16:55,252 --> 00:17:02,857
[SPEAKER_02]: And I loved, like everybody else, I liked seeing Brian down at the, um, the cemetery, the Memorial Day and the Patriots days and everything like that.

80
00:17:02,877 --> 00:17:13,222
[SPEAKER_02]: And just running into him every now and then that, uh, like I seen Stacey the other day and I'm told I was very glad I could at least say hi to him one last time, but it's very, this is very heartbreaking.

81
00:17:13,262 --> 00:17:15,604
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you George for putting this on and thank you for everybody else.

82
00:17:17,665 --> 00:17:19,386
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, could we have your name and address for the record please?

83
00:17:19,486 --> 00:17:19,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

87
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:41,366
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll call the roll and then we'll take a moment of silence.

88
00:17:41,446 --> 00:17:42,506
[SPEAKER_28]: Please call the roll, Mr. Clerk.

89
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:47,329

90
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,190
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Collins.

00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:52,063

95
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:55,907

101
00:18:00,493 --> 00:18:02,595
[SPEAKER_28]: Having the affirmative and none in the negative, the motion passes.

103
00:18:26,342 --> 00:18:49,021

104
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:49,982
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Scarpelli.

105
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,359
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Mr. President.

106
00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:01,422
[SPEAKER_32]: Tufts University seems to be a lightning rod, and it was funny, for one resident that called and said, George, they're building a monstrosity.

107
00:19:02,322 --> 00:19:12,226
[SPEAKER_32]: I tend to agree with them, but this is for recognition for a team of professionals that, as for one Councilor and one school kid member for many, many years,

108
00:19:12,893 --> 00:19:27,623
[SPEAKER_32]: whether it be Barbara or Rocco and his team that have always been there, whether they were going to get their butts kicked for an issue that Tufts didn't follow through with or something we think that they should have done more.

109
00:19:27,844 --> 00:19:33,468
[SPEAKER_32]: And I just wanted to send congratulations for their hard work.

110
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:38,111
[SPEAKER_32]: And again, thank them for always picking up the phone and

111
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:44,327
[SPEAKER_32]: at least giving us the information we need so we can serve our constituents better.

112
00:19:44,408 --> 00:19:45,568
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you, Mr. President.

113
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:48,489
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

134

[SPEAKER_39]: Good evening, President Villescaz, Vice President Collins, City Council members.

268
00:29:03,397 --> 00:29:04,357
[SPEAKER_39]: service and collision.

269
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:13,940
[SPEAKER_39]: Before you tonight, you have a request for a class two dealer's license to sell what is a limited number of vehicles, not to exceed nine on the premises.

270
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,961
[SPEAKER_39]: We went before the Board of Appeals in June of 2024.

271
00:29:18,141 --> 00:29:27,384
[SPEAKER_39]: The property is located in a C1 district that allows for new sales, but not for used vehicle sales.

272
00:29:27,804 --> 00:29:31,905
[SPEAKER_39]: We obtained a used variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals

273
00:29:32,865 --> 00:29:41,950
[SPEAKER_39]: On the basis that the property is a 31,000-square-foot parcel of land, there's an 8,300-square-foot building that houses the repair and auto body shop.

274
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:52,575
[SPEAKER_39]: The remaining portion of the premises is a substantial yard area where there would be the ability to park up to nine used vehicles.

275
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:53,695
[SPEAKER_39]: for sale.

276
00:29:54,015 --> 00:29:58,056
[SPEAKER_39]: The petitioner proposes to provide a limited number for sale on site.

277
00:29:59,336 --> 00:30:01,997
[SPEAKER_39]: Presently there's 25 exterior parking spaces.

278
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:10,639
[SPEAKER_39]: It's anticipated that the average number of vehicles that he would have at any one time on the property would be six vehicles.

279
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:16,440
[SPEAKER_39]: He is engaged in the auto body repair shop, which is a requirement for a class two dealership that you have

280
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,562
[SPEAKER_39]: somewhere where the vehicles can be brought for warranty work.

281
00:30:20,363 --> 00:30:29,209
[SPEAKER_39]: As part of his auto body business, he frequently has customers that, for one reason or another, don't want to spend the money to have their car fixed.

282
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:39,336
[SPEAKER_39]: And he would have the opportunity, if those cars were still viable, to purchase those and put them on sale, probably less expensive used cars for the public.

283
00:30:39,516 --> 00:30:42,198
[SPEAKER_39]: In addition, he deals with people whose cars have been totaled.

284
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:52,885
[SPEAKER_39]: and don't have a vehicle and this would provide him again with an opportunity to provide those people with a used vehicle for them to purchase.

285
00:30:55,858 --> 00:31:00,261
[SPEAKER_39]: As indicated, we were able to get a use variance for that purpose.

286
00:31:00,862 --> 00:31:08,428
[SPEAKER_39]: At the time, we had a number of neighbors to the property which were in favor of the variance.

287
00:31:08,648 --> 00:31:09,509
[SPEAKER_39]: Neighbors very close.

288
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:11,330
[SPEAKER_39]: They have their cars repaired there.

289
00:31:12,391 --> 00:31:16,214
[SPEAKER_39]: Obie's Auto Collision has a five-star review for

290
00:31:18,536 --> 00:31:22,279
[SPEAKER_39]: He's been in business in the city for five years previous to that.

291
00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:24,160
[SPEAKER_39]: He worked for Fantasia.

292
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:31,707
[SPEAKER_39]: Part of the restrictions that we discussed with the Board of Appeals is that he is not going to change the hours of operations.

293
00:31:31,727 --> 00:31:34,209
[SPEAKER_39]: So there will be no weekend and night operations.

294
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:35,390
[SPEAKER_39]: It's going to be a 9 to 5.

295
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,591
[SPEAKER_39]: I believe it's 9 to 5.

296
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:37,212
[SPEAKER_39]: It might be 8 to 5.

297
00:31:38,513 --> 00:31:39,973
[SPEAKER_39]: operation Monday through Friday.

298
00:31:39,994 --> 00:31:43,856
[SPEAKER_39]: There's no additional salesperson that are being introduced.

299
00:31:44,456 --> 00:31:49,820
[SPEAKER_39]: There's going to be no advertising on site or vehicles in the front of the property.

300
00:31:49,880 --> 00:32:02,028
[SPEAKER_39]: It's only basically internet sales and then sales to existing customers who are looking for a modest second-hand car in instances where they might be desperate because their car's been totaled.

301
00:32:02,728 --> 00:32:09,791
[SPEAKER_39]: And he has, you know, in order to do this type of thing, if we weren't granted the use variance, then he would have to move to another location.

302
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:11,331
[SPEAKER_39]: And it just doesn't make sense.

303
00:32:11,351 --> 00:32:16,053
[SPEAKER_39]: He's got his auto business there with the repair station right on site to deal with this.

304
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:20,875
[SPEAKER_39]: And again, we're only looking for a limited number of vehicles, not to exceed nine.

305
00:32:22,715 --> 00:32:23,095
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

306
00:32:23,155 --> 00:32:24,056
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Scarpelli.

307
00:32:24,456 --> 00:32:25,416
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Mr. President.

308
00:32:25,436 --> 00:32:27,957
[SPEAKER_32]: So I see everything in order.

309
00:32:27,977 --> 00:32:30,058
[SPEAKER_32]: I think one of the biggest questions that

310
00:32:31,884 --> 00:32:43,694
[SPEAKER_32]: was brought up maybe by one neighbor is that with the cars there, as you're doing the body work, that the overflow would then go on the streets and the side streets and affect neighborhood parking.

311
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:49,499
[SPEAKER_32]: So, I mean, I would, this business has never had an issue, Mr. President.

312
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:57,085
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know if we can add just a 30 day, 60 day, 90 day review, just to make sure that there's not overflow.

313
00:32:57,806 --> 00:32:59,467
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't see any other issue here, so.

314
00:33:01,716 --> 00:33:03,517
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you have any other questions from members of the council?

315
00:33:03,597 --> 00:33:03,697
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

316
00:33:06,457 --> 00:33:14,680
[SPEAKER_28]: Seeing none, we have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to approve with a 30, 60, and 90 day review, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

317
00:33:17,521 --> 00:33:23,343
[SPEAKER_28]: Seeing no further discussion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll to approve as amended.

318
00:33:24,383 --> 00:33:25,063
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Callahan.

[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Scarpelli.

[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

326
00:33:36,024 --> 00:33:36,584
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Tseng.

327
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:37,444
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

328
00:33:38,324 --> 00:33:38,925
[SPEAKER_37]: President Bears.

329
00:33:39,265 --> 00:33:39,545
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

330
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:41,746
[SPEAKER_28]: Having the affirmative and then the negative, the motion passes.

331
00:33:41,806 --> 00:33:42,146
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

332
00:33:43,186 --> 00:33:52,150
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. President, we move to suspend the rules to take a public participation.

333
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:57,032
[SPEAKER_28]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli to suspend the rules to take public participation.

334
00:33:57,172 --> 00:33:57,712
[SPEAKER_28]: Seconded by?

335
00:33:59,127 --> 00:34:00,348
[SPEAKER_28]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

336
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:02,469

[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Lazzaro.

341
00:34:25,286 --> 00:34:25,526
[SPEAKER_38]: No.

342

[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Leming.

343
00:34:32,346 --> 00:34:33,649
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm sorry to hear.

344
00:34:33,789 --> 00:34:34,049
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

345
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:35,672
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Scarpelli.

346
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:36,053

[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Tseng.

348
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:38,156
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

349
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:44,221
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, 60 affirmative one of the negative the motion passes public participation.

350
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:52,603
[SPEAKER_28]: Greg Collins, July 10 2025 to the Honorable City Council, the undersigned respectfully request for tree removal.

351
00:34:52,844 --> 00:34:54,924
[SPEAKER_28]: I am a homeowner in Medford since 2016.

352
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:58,365
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm currently in the process of building a new home on Walcott Street.

353
00:34:58,505 --> 00:35:03,127
[SPEAKER_28]: Unfortunately, I need to remove a tree located on a public sidewalk in order to have a functioning driveway.

354
00:35:03,785 --> 00:35:14,096
[SPEAKER_28]: I follow the protocols with the tree warden DPW, and they have ignored my rightful due process to have a public hearing in order to remove the tree petitioner's name Greg Collins residents 41 Fulton Street 77 Walcott Street, Greg.

355
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:19,770
[SPEAKER_28]: You have the floor, you have three minutes.

356
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,651
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, City Council.

357
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:23,093
[SPEAKER_29]: So let me just introduce myself.

358
00:35:23,113 --> 00:35:24,154
[SPEAKER_29]: My name is Greg Collins.

359
00:35:24,734 --> 00:35:27,697
[SPEAKER_29]: I purchased my first house in Medford in 2016.

360
00:35:28,537 --> 00:35:37,004
[SPEAKER_29]: My grandfather grew up on Forest Street during World War II, and so Medford's always kind of been a theme in my family.

361
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:38,205
[SPEAKER_29]: Love the city.

362
00:35:40,247 --> 00:35:42,709
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm building a house on Walcott Street.

363
00:35:44,718 --> 00:35:51,384
[SPEAKER_29]: Part of the construction, we bumped out part of the front where the existing driveway was.

364
00:35:52,164 --> 00:36:01,932
[SPEAKER_29]: And so essentially, in the plans, we have to have the driveway go up along the left side of the house where there's 10 feet of clearance.

365
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:12,741
[SPEAKER_29]: And so there is a tree currently on that side of the house.

366
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:35,034
[SPEAKER_29]: And so I would like to go through the process through the DPPW to remove the tree, go through the public hearing process, see if the public has any, you know, objection to moving the tree so that we can put in a driveway so that the family can functionally live in this house.

367
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:40,495
[SPEAKER_29]: And so my understanding and what's on the website is that

368
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:53,632
[SPEAKER_29]: Trees cannot be removed unless the tree warden or the deputy deems the tree unhealthy or dead or approved through a public hearing.

369
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:57,792
[SPEAKER_29]: Public hearings are requested in writing to the tree warden.

370
00:36:59,813 --> 00:37:04,093
[SPEAKER_29]: So I requested this hearing back in early May.

371
00:37:04,113 --> 00:37:11,795
[SPEAKER_29]: Excuse me, I have a whole list of dates, but I'll just try to summarize it for you guys.

372
00:37:13,376 --> 00:37:16,338
[SPEAKER_29]: I talked to Aggie about having the hearing.

373
00:37:16,418 --> 00:37:17,278
[SPEAKER_29]: She said it was okay.

374
00:37:17,298 --> 00:37:31,505
[SPEAKER_29]: She explained, okay, well, we're gonna take the circumference of the tree if the public doesn't have any objection to it, and we'll have to plant four to six more trees in the neighborhood if we take the tree down.

375
00:37:31,985 --> 00:37:33,926
[SPEAKER_29]: And that sounds fine.

376
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:37,768
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm fine with paying for the new trees and going through the public hearing process.

377
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:40,590
[SPEAKER_29]: That seems like a fair trade-off.

378
00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:59,091
[SPEAKER_29]: So this all started back in May and really there's just this long period of silence from the DPW and Aggie and you know I'm trying to be very patient because I understand that you know there's reasons for some of the delays.

379
00:37:59,992 --> 00:38:04,016
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm trying to be very cordial but I was really basically ignored up until

380
00:38:05,237 --> 00:38:10,440
[SPEAKER_29]: July 10th, I finally got an attorney to reach out to the mayor's office to say, what's going on?

381
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,221
[SPEAKER_29]: Like, they're not responding to my emails.

382
00:38:12,321 --> 00:38:17,924
[SPEAKER_29]: I go to the office, they tell me that, oh, I'm gonna get a call back, nothing, just silence.

383
00:38:19,845 --> 00:38:31,951
[SPEAKER_29]: And so, all I'm asking for is what's on the Medford City website to have a public hearing to see if anyone has any objection to removing the tree.

384
00:38:33,508 --> 00:38:36,028
[SPEAKER_29]: If there's objection from a public, then that's fine.

385
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:39,529
[SPEAKER_29]: But that's how the democratic process works.

386
00:38:40,229 --> 00:38:41,349
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'd be fine with that.

387
00:38:41,529 --> 00:38:44,850
[SPEAKER_29]: But all I'm asking for is to go through that process.

388
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:52,331
[SPEAKER_29]: And it appears that the tree warden and the DPW is just not worth their time to do that.

389
00:38:53,392 --> 00:39:00,233
[SPEAKER_29]: And so I'm just here to bring that to the council and just let you guys know that

390
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,049
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, I'm a member of the community.

391
00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:08,411
[SPEAKER_29]: I demand, you know, I should have the same respect as anyone else.

392
00:39:08,831 --> 00:39:15,493
[SPEAKER_29]: And I would just like to have some guidance on this.

393
00:39:15,693 --> 00:39:16,253
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

394
00:39:16,513 --> 00:39:17,713
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll recognize Councilor Scarpelli.

395
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:21,334
[SPEAKER_28]: And then I did receive an email from the DPW commissioner on this matter that I can read.

396
00:39:21,354 --> 00:39:23,235
[SPEAKER_32]: I yield to you, Mr. President.

397
00:39:23,705 --> 00:39:24,225
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

398
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:26,566
[SPEAKER_28]: So thanks for being here tonight.

399
00:39:26,626 --> 00:39:27,766
[SPEAKER_28]: Appreciate your petition.

400
00:39:28,726 --> 00:39:36,248
[SPEAKER_28]: As you probably know, considering you've been going through this for a few months, the public shade tree and the public hearings are governed by mass general law.

401
00:39:37,268 --> 00:39:38,629
[SPEAKER_28]: And the council doesn't have a role in them.

402
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:44,910
[SPEAKER_28]: But of course, you know, we do hear from folks in this space about many things that are going on in the city.

403
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,891
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to read this response.

404
00:39:46,911 --> 00:39:47,291
[SPEAKER_28]: It is not

405
00:39:48,295 --> 00:39:50,537
[SPEAKER_28]: My, uh, it's not coming from me.

406
00:39:50,577 --> 00:39:52,259
[SPEAKER_28]: It's coming from the DPW commissioner.

407
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,882
[SPEAKER_28]: He wrote me after the agenda went out.

408
00:39:55,002 --> 00:39:56,203
[SPEAKER_28]: Good morning, President Bears.

409
00:39:56,383 --> 00:40:03,190
[SPEAKER_28]: I wanted to bring to your attention information regarding the issue with Mr. Greg Collins and the public tree that is on your agenda for next week.

410
00:40:03,812 --> 00:40:07,516
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Collins has not granted a permit from the tree warden to remove a public shade tree.

411
00:40:08,016 --> 00:40:08,837
[SPEAKER_28]: He would like a hearing.

412
00:40:08,997 --> 00:40:13,241
[SPEAKER_28]: However, hearings are required when a permit is issued to remove or take down a public shade tree.

413
00:40:13,742 --> 00:40:16,564
[SPEAKER_28]: Despite his claims, the tree warden has been responsive to him.

414
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:25,213
[SPEAKER_28]: It is also worth noting that the building project began prior to the proponent receiving plan approval at the engineering division for elements such as the ROW curb cut.

415
00:40:25,834 --> 00:40:28,796
[SPEAKER_28]: Unfortunately, the desired driveway for the project would eliminate a tree.

416
00:40:29,317 --> 00:40:33,199
[SPEAKER_28]: The proponent asked to remove the tree, and the tree warden said no, denying the permission.

417
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:40,144
[SPEAKER_28]: Typically, site plans are approved at the engineering division prior to building, and especially if there are new curb cut locations.

418
00:40:40,265 --> 00:40:45,468
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Collins is now represented by an attorney, and the communication has moved from the DPW to the city solicitor.

419
00:40:45,488 --> 00:40:46,669
[SPEAKER_28]: I hope this helps.

420
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:47,950
[SPEAKER_28]: Regards, Tim.

421
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:50,452
[SPEAKER_28]: I can recognize Councilor Scarpelli.

422
00:40:57,003 --> 00:41:06,331
[SPEAKER_32]: you know, if that answer isn't efficient or it doesn't, then I'll gladly reach out to you tomorrow.

423
00:41:06,371 --> 00:41:09,514
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll call the city solicitor myself and see if there's a way we can help, so.

424
00:41:12,897 --> 00:41:21,120
[SPEAKER_29]: Like, you know, weeks or months ago, all I was looking for was for some kind of response from the DPW commissioner from Aggie.

425
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,481
[SPEAKER_29]: But like I said, it was just silence for months.

426
00:41:24,161 --> 00:41:26,982
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm trying to, you know, I was trying to be very patient with everyone.

427
00:41:27,831 --> 00:41:29,813
[SPEAKER_29]: But I haven't even heard that from the commissioner.

428
00:41:29,873 --> 00:41:31,554
[SPEAKER_29]: So now I'm hearing it for the first time.

429
00:41:32,755 --> 00:41:35,317
[SPEAKER_29]: So again, I'll talk to my attorney and see what I can do.

430
00:41:35,377 --> 00:41:41,682
[SPEAKER_29]: And first and foremost, I want to be continuing to be having a good relationship with the city.

431
00:41:41,702 --> 00:41:46,966
[SPEAKER_29]: I plan on having my house here for many years to come.

432
00:41:47,066 --> 00:41:53,030
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's important to me that I have a good relationship with everyone and hope we can get this sorted out.

433
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:54,792
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's it.

434
00:41:57,244 --> 00:41:57,584
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

435
00:41:57,604 --> 00:42:03,370
[SPEAKER_28]: I appreciate your time coming down and Councilor Scarpelli as well for your offer.

436
00:42:06,334 --> 00:42:08,256
[SPEAKER_28]: Continuing in public participation.

437
00:42:10,038 --> 00:42:13,121
[SPEAKER_28]: If you'd like to speak in public participation, you'll have three minutes.

438
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:16,685
[SPEAKER_28]: You can raise your hand on Zoom or come to the podium in person.

439
00:42:16,725 --> 00:42:19,708
[SPEAKER_28]: We will alternate between the podium and Zoom.

440
00:42:28,733 --> 00:42:29,114
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi there.

441
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:30,876
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

442
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:31,898
[SPEAKER_28]: And you'll have three minutes.

443
00:42:32,098 --> 00:42:32,659
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

444
00:42:32,779 --> 00:42:41,131
[SPEAKER_31]: My name is Rahma, but I'm here on behalf of SEIU 32BJ and our member Maria is going to read a short statement and then I'll translate it in English.

445
00:42:44,757 --> 00:43:07,871
[SPEAKER_00]: mi nombre es maria coto limpia la escuela secundaria medford intermedia durante 10 años disfruté mi trabajo y estaba orgullosa de proporcionar un ambiente de aprendizaje limpio y sanitario para los estudiantes de medford mis compañeras de trabajo y yo teníamos salarios justos beneficios y condiciones laborales bajo un contrato sindical con

446
00:43:09,552 --> 00:43:11,854
[SPEAKER_00]: S-E-I-U-32-B-J.

447
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:20,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Sin embargo, el distrito ahora ha concedido su contrato de limpieza a una nueva empresa llamada Partners Facility Solutions.

448
00:43:21,702 --> 00:43:32,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Es una empresa no sindical que se negó a contratarme a mí y a mis compañeras de trabajo a pesar de varios intentos de postular el sindicato.

449
00:43:33,352 --> 00:43:36,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Ha presentado una denuncia

450
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:37,855
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll read quickly.

451
00:44:00,658 --> 00:44:05,439
[SPEAKER_31]: My name is Maria Cotto and I cleaned Medford High School and McGlynn Middle School for 10 years.

452
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:11,101
[SPEAKER_31]: I enjoyed my work and was proud to provide a clear and sanitary learning environment for Medford students.

453
00:44:11,701 --> 00:44:17,783
[SPEAKER_31]: My co-workers and I had fair wages, benefits, and working conditions under a union contract with SEIU 32BJ.

454
00:44:19,163 --> 00:44:31,405
[SPEAKER_31]: However the district has now awarded its janitorial contract to a new company called Partners Facility Solutions, which is a non-union company that refused to hire me and my co-workers despite several attempts to apply.

455
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:39,687
[SPEAKER_31]: The union has filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board alleging the partners refusing to hire us because we are part of a union.

456
00:44:40,327 --> 00:44:47,468
[SPEAKER_31]: The City of Medford should do the right thing and choose a responsible contractor for the next school year that will respect our union and our work.

457
00:44:47,848 --> 00:44:48,128
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

458
00:44:50,682 --> 00:44:51,142
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

459
00:44:51,342 --> 00:44:54,243
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there anything else you'd like to add with your additional time?

460
00:44:55,464 --> 00:44:57,465
[SPEAKER_31]: I think, I don't think so.

461
00:44:57,565 --> 00:44:59,145
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

462
00:44:59,205 --> 00:45:00,106
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for speaking.

463
00:45:00,126 --> 00:45:03,687
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there any councilors who'd like to say anything at this time?

464
00:45:07,308 --> 00:45:09,009
[SPEAKER_28]: Go to Councilor Callahan.

465
00:45:11,815 --> 00:45:16,077
[SPEAKER_17]: I am very sorry to hear about this.

466
00:45:16,097 --> 00:45:18,578
[SPEAKER_17]: I want my city to be a pro-union city.

467
00:45:18,598 --> 00:45:21,979
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the janitorial staff should be union members.

468
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:28,522
[SPEAKER_17]: So I will certainly do what I can to look into it.

469
00:45:29,786 --> 00:45:30,147
[SPEAKER_17]: clearly.

470
00:45:31,447 --> 00:45:37,772
[SPEAKER_17]: City is not the purview of the City Council exactly, but I really appreciate you coming here and bringing your stories.

471
00:45:39,553 --> 00:45:42,635
[SPEAKER_17]: And it definitely is something that we can have an impact on.

472
00:45:42,695 --> 00:45:44,396
[SPEAKER_17]: So let's see what we can do.

473
00:45:44,496 --> 00:45:45,156
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

474
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:46,737
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that this is alarming because

475
00:45:59,204 --> 00:46:05,529
[SPEAKER_32]: If not, most of all of our employees that work for the city and our active custodians are all members of the union.

476
00:46:05,549 --> 00:46:20,079
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think having organized labor, you can see what's happening across the country right now and making sure that our community is supported through labor and making sure that initiatives that come up, it's for the benefit of our community.

477
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:23,002
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's why we support our union.

478
00:46:23,102 --> 00:46:25,864
[SPEAKER_32]: So I find this very disturbing.

479
00:46:26,044 --> 00:46:27,045
[SPEAKER_32]: So I think that this is,

480
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:39,267
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, everything talks about cost cutting, but having union employees and having our employees represented and protected, I think, speaks volumes.

481
00:46:39,347 --> 00:46:48,133
[SPEAKER_32]: So, for one, Councilor, if there's something I can do, I will definitely reach out and, you know, see what we can do to support

482
00:46:49,461 --> 00:46:51,422
[SPEAKER_32]: your organization in moving forward.

483
00:46:52,363 --> 00:46:59,428
[SPEAKER_32]: If I gather, I know that we've been reaching out to see even with to this non-union company to be hired, they're not even coming, getting back to you.

484
00:46:59,568 --> 00:46:59,968
[SPEAKER_31]: That's right.

485
00:47:00,249 --> 00:47:01,910
[SPEAKER_31]: Our members have replied numerous times.

486
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:09,556
[SPEAKER_31]: In fact, it has occurred there's a charge with the National Labor Relations Board because of their refusal to hire our members, and we believe that's purely because they're union members.

487
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,783
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, and again, that's what happens now.

488
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:22,044
[SPEAKER_32]: There's a greedy person at the top.

489
00:47:22,184 --> 00:47:27,268
[SPEAKER_32]: He's benefiting from the people that are getting their butts kicked every day doing the work.

490
00:47:27,468 --> 00:47:31,670
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that's why unions balance that situation.

491
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:36,193
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you, Mr. President, but I look forward to working with you to make sure that it's rectified.

492
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:36,494
[SPEAKER_32]: Thanks.

493
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:37,474
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

494
00:47:37,594 --> 00:47:38,235
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Leming.

495
00:47:40,144 --> 00:47:45,329
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, I'd like to echo the sentiments that my colleagues just offered.

496
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:58,601
[SPEAKER_33]: I'd also just like to encourage you to follow up later so that we can do what we can do behind the scenes and at a council meeting to help out with the situation.

497
00:47:58,621 --> 00:48:02,925
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm not pleased to hear about this, and thank you for coming out here and speaking.

498
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:12,207
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, yeah, and I will communicate to the superintendent that we heard from you tonight and ask for a response.

499
00:48:12,808 --> 00:48:13,390
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you so much.

500
00:48:24,377 --> 00:48:26,578
[SPEAKER_28]: We're still in public participation.

501
00:48:26,919 --> 00:48:32,782
[SPEAKER_28]: If you'd like to speak in public participation, you can come to the podium or make a line behind the podium and raise your hand on Zoom.

502
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:35,224
[SPEAKER_28]: Seeing no hands on Zoom, we'll go to the podium.

503
00:48:35,444 --> 00:48:36,505
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record.

504
00:48:36,525 --> 00:48:37,125
[SPEAKER_28]: You have three minutes.

505
00:48:37,145 --> 00:48:40,647
[SPEAKER_20]: Sharon Diesso, corner of Circuit Road and Mass Ave in Medford.

506
00:48:43,223 --> 00:48:44,143
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, everyone.

507
00:48:45,024 --> 00:48:46,245
[SPEAKER_20]: It's nice to see everyone.

508
00:48:46,305 --> 00:48:48,806
[SPEAKER_20]: What's concerned matters, even in this dire heat.

509
00:48:49,386 --> 00:48:53,528
[SPEAKER_20]: I just have a quick question for those who may have come in a little late, and I'm a little confused.

510
00:48:54,029 --> 00:49:04,934
[SPEAKER_20]: Many of us have been following the zoning news, but the public hearing on zoning news at the beginning of tonight's meeting, President Beas, was postponed to September 9th.

511
00:49:05,495 --> 00:49:09,677
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, the board is meeting, I think, one more time in August and then September 3rd.

512
00:49:10,437 --> 00:49:23,312
[SPEAKER_20]: So do we have to wait until you like rebuttal with them and then we can participate on comments, wait until September 9, because you have another motion on the agenda this evening regarding zoning.

513
00:49:23,792 --> 00:49:29,499
[SPEAKER_20]: So when we'll be able to comment ourselves on items that we have reviewed.

514
00:49:30,627 --> 00:49:36,470
[SPEAKER_28]: Sure, so there are three active zoning amendment proposals currently under consideration.

515
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:39,991
[SPEAKER_28]: One is the residential districts and ADUs.

516
00:49:40,531 --> 00:49:47,734
[SPEAKER_28]: That was referred to the Community Development Board in, I want to say March, and they've had several public hearings on it.

517
00:49:48,315 --> 00:49:53,197
[SPEAKER_28]: Their last public hearing was last week, and they're having another one in early August.

518
00:49:53,917 --> 00:49:56,418
[SPEAKER_28]: for the residential and ADU proposals.

519
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:02,262
[SPEAKER_28]: And I believe the comment deadline for the written comment is July 23rd.

520
00:50:02,322 --> 00:50:05,203
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the deadline that they have set for written comments.

521
00:50:06,344 --> 00:50:11,466
[SPEAKER_28]: And I believe they have said that on August 5th, they will be deliberating, but they won't be hearing public comment.

522
00:50:11,907 --> 00:50:17,590
[SPEAKER_28]: And they will be directing the planning consultant to draft a new set of recommendations.

523
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:26,592
[SPEAKER_28]: Once that's done, they're going to hold further public hearings in September and October before referring recommendations back to the Council.

524
00:50:27,092 --> 00:50:30,593
[SPEAKER_28]: That's on the residential and the accessory dwelling units proposal.

525
00:50:31,234 --> 00:50:39,136
[SPEAKER_28]: The proposal that was on our agenda tonight that was delayed till September is a public hearing on Medford Square and West Medford Square zoning.

526
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:54,044
[SPEAKER_28]: the CD board had a meeting on that proposal, I think the last week of June and maybe discussed it further last week and they have to continue to hold public hearings before making recommendations to the council.

527
00:50:54,524 --> 00:51:02,368
[SPEAKER_28]: We can't take action until we receive recommendations from the community development board or the community development board chooses not to make a recommendation.

528
00:51:02,868 --> 00:51:04,789
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's why we had to delay the public hearing.

529
00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:07,391
[SPEAKER_28]: We don't have recommendations, so we can't take action.

530
00:51:08,011 --> 00:51:23,744
[SPEAKER_28]: The third proposal is the proposal for what's called other corridors that consists of Broadway, Boston Avenue, High Street, Harvard Street, and Main Street, various kind of mixed-use lots on those streets.

531
00:51:24,885 --> 00:51:31,570
[SPEAKER_28]: And the CD board has requested that we hold off on referring that to them until at least our August 5th meeting, so that was tabled.

532
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:54,462
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay so when would the residential be reviewed again because we had the meeting before the last one had one way of thinking and the last one there were many more people who have been informed so I really really urge anyone if they can think of another way besides internet communication for many people who will be affected especially older people

533
00:51:55,002 --> 00:52:07,174
[SPEAKER_20]: that we need to get some sort of a flyer, besides stuffing it in a tax bill, because that precludes renters, and it also precludes business lessees, you know who don't know that this is going on.

534
00:52:07,275 --> 00:52:07,855
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks a lot.

535
00:52:08,296 --> 00:52:08,656
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

536
00:52:10,658 --> 00:52:16,504
[SPEAKER_28]: I see a Maria on zoom Maria I'll go to you name and address for the record and you have three minutes.

537
00:52:17,643 --> 00:52:19,643
[SPEAKER_42]: I just wanted to double check.

538
00:52:19,663 --> 00:52:25,605
[SPEAKER_42]: Did you say the values aligned local investments ordinance is deferred to September the 9th?

539
00:52:27,285 --> 00:52:31,146
[SPEAKER_28]: The investments ordinance is tabled to the next regular meeting on August 5th.

540
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:32,486
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

541
00:52:33,726 --> 00:52:34,166
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

542
00:52:38,407 --> 00:52:39,608
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll go back to the podium.

543
00:52:39,648 --> 00:52:40,748
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

544
00:52:40,768 --> 00:52:41,468
[SPEAKER_28]: You have three minutes.

545
00:52:42,601 --> 00:52:50,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Roy Belson, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, a longtime member of the Jewish community, and a former employee of the Medford Public Schools for 50 years.

546
00:52:51,707 --> 00:52:58,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here to speak tonight on the proposed ordinance that you did lay on the table, but I believe I have some words to say that I would like to have heard.

547
00:53:00,373 --> 00:53:02,975
[SPEAKER_03]: So good evening, Mr. President, members of the council.

548
00:53:04,456 --> 00:53:09,600
[SPEAKER_03]: The role of city government is to focus on the welfare and betterment of the community.

549
00:53:10,525 --> 00:53:15,408
[SPEAKER_03]: As individuals, you always have the right to advocate for issues in the international arena.

550
00:53:16,468 --> 00:53:30,536
[SPEAKER_03]: As a local governmental body representing a diverse community, you need to promote harmony, not create friction and fragmentation over an issue that is not your mandate and well beyond your capacity to significantly influence.

551
00:53:31,556 --> 00:53:33,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Words carry meaning.

552
00:53:34,198 --> 00:53:40,161
[SPEAKER_03]: The old saw that sticks and stones may break bones, but words will never harm me is very misleading.

553
00:53:41,042 --> 00:53:43,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes words are sharper than a sword.

554
00:53:45,064 --> 00:53:54,689
[SPEAKER_03]: All you have to do is study social media or be bombarded with campaigns of disinformation to realize that words can lead to severe negative outcomes.

555
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:02,534
[SPEAKER_03]: To paraphrase, the road to disaster is often paved with good intentions.

556
00:54:03,634 --> 00:54:10,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not let your zeal to advance your ideals blind you to adverse impacts your actions can and will create.

557
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,742
[SPEAKER_03]: The issues in the Middle East are not just contemporary, but are hundreds of years old.

558
00:54:17,702 --> 00:54:29,325
[SPEAKER_03]: The causes and circumstances are complex, and the resolution has been defying even the most honorable peace brokers amidst the actions of multiple terrorist groups and partisan fanatics.

559
00:54:30,326 --> 00:54:40,929
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to agree with all of Israeli policies and practices to recognize the Israelis' right to exist, but to recognize the urgent need to eliminate any possibility

560
00:54:41,697 --> 00:54:43,458
[SPEAKER_03]: of anti-Semitism in our community.

561
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:55,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently, think about the young couple in Washington, Yaron and Sarah, who were gunned down leaving the Israeli embassy by a man screaming, free Palestine.

562
00:54:55,903 --> 00:55:06,667
[SPEAKER_03]: And 11 days later, think about what happened in Boulder, Colorado, when a man yelling, free Palestine, threw a Molotov cocktail at peaceful marchers calling for the release of hostages.

563
00:55:07,557 --> 00:55:16,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who barely escaped with his family a fire in his home started by another man calling to free Palestine.

564
00:55:17,301 --> 00:55:18,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I could go on.

565
00:55:19,062 --> 00:55:22,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't think for a moment it couldn't happen here in Medford.

566
00:55:23,584 --> 00:55:27,366
[SPEAKER_03]: We are as vulnerable as any other Jewish American community.

567
00:55:28,387 --> 00:55:31,708
[SPEAKER_03]: The proposed ordinances are performative at best.

568
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:35,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Passage will not alter the international reality.

569
00:55:36,983 --> 00:55:39,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Any study of BDS has not proven effective.

570
00:55:40,386 --> 00:55:50,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Massachusetts law and practice makes implementation of such a proposal impractical and not in the best financial interests of the community.

571
00:55:53,618 --> 00:55:56,461
[SPEAKER_03]: You already passed a resolution in February of this year.

572
00:55:57,502 --> 00:56:03,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you accept accountability if anti-Semitic violence happens in our community?

573
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't delude the Palestinian supporters in our community that such an ordinance can even be enforced.

574
00:56:11,085 --> 00:56:15,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't subject the Jewish citizens in our community to a greater threat of hate and violence.

575
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,552
[SPEAKER_03]: It can happen here.

576
00:56:19,412 --> 00:56:24,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, demonstrate real leadership by rejecting performative votes.

577
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:32,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can preserve and advance your values and concerns much better by promoting community dialogue,

578
00:56:32,863 --> 00:56:36,568
[SPEAKER_03]: by bringing citizens together, by promoting understanding.

579
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:40,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Council business has many challenges and you know it.

580
00:56:40,894 --> 00:56:44,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Focus on what you can do to better unify the community.

581
00:56:45,241 --> 00:56:46,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for listening.

582
00:56:46,863 --> 00:56:47,183
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

583
00:56:52,104 --> 00:56:55,967
[SPEAKER_28]: Seeing no hands on zoom will stay at the podium name and address for the record please give three minutes.

584
00:56:56,908 --> 00:56:58,088
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, sir.

585
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:02,031
[SPEAKER_25]: My name is Mike Cohen, I am you guys hear me okay, we can hear you.

586
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:04,113
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I live at 200 Brooke Street.

587
00:57:04,914 --> 00:57:10,338
[SPEAKER_25]: And so I'm here tonight, not as a foreign policy expert because, well, frankly, that's not

588
00:57:11,038 --> 00:57:12,458
[SPEAKER_25]: what we should be talking about here.

589
00:57:12,478 --> 00:57:19,600
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm here as a concerned resident, and I'm here because something doesn't sit right and that so called values alignment investment ordinance.

590
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,581
[SPEAKER_25]: Now it sounds righteous, I get it but it really crosses a lot of moral and civic lines.

591
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:35,703
[SPEAKER_25]: And let's be honest, you know you guys do a lot and I respect what the city council does, but certainly foreign policy that's not in the city charter, right.

592
00:57:38,585 --> 00:57:43,810
[SPEAKER_25]: This ordinance, it goes out of its way not to mention Israel, but we know what it really does.

593
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:45,791
[SPEAKER_25]: It unmistakably targets it.

594
00:57:46,372 --> 00:57:47,693
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a dramatic overreach.

595
00:57:48,093 --> 00:57:49,294
[SPEAKER_25]: Worse, it's a distraction.

596
00:57:49,735 --> 00:57:53,878
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like parks and recreation issuing a position on nuclear disarmament.

597
00:57:54,619 --> 00:57:55,340
[SPEAKER_25]: What's gonna happen there?

598
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:55,780
[SPEAKER_25]: Not much.

599
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:56,881
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not in your lane.

600
00:57:58,903 --> 00:57:59,984
[SPEAKER_25]: And I don't wanna kid ourselves.

601
00:58:00,124 --> 00:58:03,147
[SPEAKER_25]: The omission of Israel doesn't make this ordinance more neutral.

602
00:58:03,827 --> 00:58:05,128
[SPEAKER_25]: It makes it more insidious.

603
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:12,828
[SPEAKER_25]: It pretends to be about human rights, but it holds one country, that little country that so they do everything wrong.

604
00:58:13,488 --> 00:58:18,452
[SPEAKER_25]: The only Jewish state, the singular, they hold them to a singular and impossible standard.

605
00:58:18,853 --> 00:58:21,155
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's not a principled stance, it's a targeted one.

606
00:58:22,656 --> 00:58:24,658
[SPEAKER_25]: Now we know how antisemitism morphs.

607
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:27,000
[SPEAKER_25]: If you look at history, it's slippery.

608
00:58:28,164 --> 00:58:30,407
[SPEAKER_25]: First it was about religion, then race.

609
00:58:31,228 --> 00:58:33,110
[SPEAKER_25]: Now it's politics and policy.

610
00:58:33,631 --> 00:58:36,835
[SPEAKER_25]: The justifications change, the target don't.

611
00:58:37,896 --> 00:58:39,939
[SPEAKER_25]: We see it, we know it, we won't ignore it.

612
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:43,723
[SPEAKER_25]: And let's not kid ourselves, do not alienate or scapegoat Jewish people.

613
00:58:43,824 --> 00:58:44,785
[SPEAKER_25]: We won't stand for it.

614
00:58:45,984 --> 00:58:47,425
[SPEAKER_25]: The ordinance doesn't help anyone.

615
00:58:48,105 --> 00:58:50,386
[SPEAKER_25]: It doesn't advance peace, it doesn't save lives.

616
00:58:51,206 --> 00:58:55,828
[SPEAKER_25]: What it does do is single out Israel and by extension Jewish people under the guise of justice.

617
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:59,210
[SPEAKER_25]: But justice that only applies to one group, that's not justice.

618
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,411
[SPEAKER_25]: That's biased with the press release.

619
00:59:03,352 --> 00:59:07,854
[SPEAKER_25]: I know in a lot of circles it's fashionable to be anti-Israel, but it doesn't make it right.

620
00:59:08,741 --> 00:59:21,691
[SPEAKER_25]: So I urge you all, ladies and gentlemen, please stay focused on your mission, fix what's local, fund what matters, and please don't turn the city into a billboard for a one-sided device foreign policy statement.

621
00:59:22,131 --> 00:59:22,992
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you for your time, folks.

622
00:59:23,673 --> 00:59:24,473
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

623
00:59:24,513 --> 00:59:31,479
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to go to Zoom.

624
00:59:32,499 --> 00:59:34,081
[SPEAKER_28]: We have Micah Kesselman on Zoom.

625
00:59:34,361 --> 00:59:36,022
[SPEAKER_28]: Micah, name and address for the record, please.

626
00:59:36,042 --> 00:59:36,863
[SPEAKER_28]: You'll have three minutes.

627
00:59:39,113 --> 00:59:39,333
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

628
00:59:39,353 --> 00:59:39,733
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you hear me?

629
00:59:40,753 --> 00:59:40,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

630
00:59:41,974 --> 00:59:42,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

631
00:59:42,334 --> 00:59:42,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

632
00:59:42,514 --> 00:59:43,454
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Micah Kesselman.

633
00:59:43,474 --> 00:59:44,734
[SPEAKER_09]: I live at 499 Main Street.

634
00:59:46,535 --> 00:59:53,436
[SPEAKER_09]: I was not going to make any comments tonight, but I just want to respond to some of the things that have already been said.

635
00:59:53,616 --> 01:00:02,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's understand for everyone here that that is making comments against the ethical investment ordinance or values aligned investment ordinance.

636
01:00:03,439 --> 01:00:04,159
[SPEAKER_09]: This was brought

637
01:00:05,307 --> 01:00:18,169
[SPEAKER_09]: to the city council by a cross-section of people who live in Medford from various parts of the community that are concerned about the way that we invest our money and finances.

638
01:00:19,022 --> 01:00:30,965
[SPEAKER_09]: It is fundamentally about how a city invests the money and how it exercises the controls that it is allowed to under mass general laws.

639
01:00:31,705 --> 01:00:34,085
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a fundamentally local issue.

640
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:38,486
[SPEAKER_09]: And not only is it a local issue, it's a local issue that was brought forward by residents of the community.

641
01:00:39,466 --> 01:00:42,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Nowhere does it say Israel in specific.

642
01:00:43,167 --> 01:00:46,268
[SPEAKER_09]: It refers to human rights violations,

643
01:00:47,555 --> 01:00:53,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Myanmar, Saudi Arabia, various other countries which might be found to be under it.

644
01:00:53,859 --> 01:01:03,304
[SPEAKER_09]: No one is out there saying that it's against Asians or against Saudis or anything like that.

645
01:01:04,364 --> 01:01:10,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Moreover, I want people to really think about what they're saying when they're implying, imputing

646
01:01:11,537 --> 01:01:18,282
[SPEAKER_09]: anti-semitism in an ordinance that doesn't even directly attack like go after Israel.

647
01:01:19,482 --> 01:01:28,248
[SPEAKER_09]: You are equivocating issues with a state to be issues with a people with an ethnicity.

648
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:29,989
[SPEAKER_09]: That is dangerous.

649
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:33,392
[SPEAKER_09]: We just saw in the last few days

650
01:01:35,013 --> 01:01:43,339
[SPEAKER_09]: The Elmo incident on social media where someone hacked the account and was spewing horrible anti-Semitic things.

651
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Notice what they were doing, though.

652
01:01:45,741 --> 01:01:54,248
[SPEAKER_09]: They were basing that call on that equivocation between Judaism and Israel.

653
01:01:55,857 --> 01:02:16,052
[SPEAKER_09]: It is dangerous to equivocate the two, and by doing what a lot of you guys are doing, you are feeding into that equivocation narrative, which is dangerous for me and my fellow Jews in the community, and more so that makes me really angry and hard for me to keep it down, is that it makes it dangerous for my son.

654
01:02:16,773 --> 01:02:18,814
[SPEAKER_09]: for my children and my family.

655
01:02:19,274 --> 01:02:27,978
[SPEAKER_09]: So stop equivocating anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism or a-Zionism or diasporism.

656
01:02:28,758 --> 01:02:31,579
[SPEAKER_09]: It's dangerous to all of us.

657
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:34,781
[SPEAKER_28]: That's it.

658
01:02:36,261 --> 01:02:37,382
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

659
01:02:39,443 --> 01:02:40,603
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll go back to the podium.

660
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:41,884
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

661
01:02:41,904 --> 01:02:42,624
[SPEAKER_28]: You have three minutes.

662
01:02:43,503 --> 01:02:43,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, everyone.

663
01:02:44,164 --> 01:02:45,485
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Max embarrassing.

664
01:02:45,505 --> 01:02:47,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I live at 30 review Beach Parkway from Medford.

665
01:02:48,587 --> 01:02:52,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to start just by making some personal comments that I like to read out a letter.

666
01:02:54,391 --> 01:02:58,474
[SPEAKER_05]: For one thing I want to address some of the points that were also recently just made.

667
01:03:00,215 --> 01:03:08,582
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the language that is used within paragraph D of the values ordinance is particularly politically charged.

668
01:03:09,323 --> 01:03:21,553
[SPEAKER_05]: It's quite provocative, and it is undoubtedly taking advantage of a lot of the things that people might come to mind due to the discourse that is kind of self propagated throughout

669
01:03:22,734 --> 01:03:23,855
[SPEAKER_05]: online culture nowadays.

670
01:03:24,595 --> 01:03:37,108
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of that language that's quite provocative and debatable and often contested includes the words of apartheid genocide ethnic cleansing and everyone gets very riled up when they, when they see these things.

671
01:03:39,288 --> 01:03:41,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to make some personal comments.

672
01:03:41,748 --> 01:03:45,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a homeowner and a taxpaying Medford resident of five years.

673
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:53,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to voice my opposition to the inclusion of paragraph D in the Medford values aligned local investment ordinance.

674
01:03:54,431 --> 01:04:06,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually support paragraphs A, B, C, and E, and I think that the majority of people here do, but we cannot beat around the bush of the fact that the language in paragraph D is lifted

675
01:04:06,933 --> 01:04:18,695
[SPEAKER_05]: quite directly from a lot of the guidelines and narratives pushed by the Boycott, Divest and Sanction movement, and that is undoubtedly targeted at Israel in the use of this language.

676
01:04:19,215 --> 01:04:27,096
[SPEAKER_05]: And it often hides behind this cloud of ambiguity of, you know, we could apply this to many different nations.

677
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:35,098
[SPEAKER_05]: And while we can have all of those discussions, it's obviously going to be targeted at Israel at the point of this discussion.

678
01:04:38,002 --> 01:04:47,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I also don't believe that the language in the particular paragraph that we're discussing particularly to the city of Medford is in the budgetary interests of the city.

679
01:04:48,191 --> 01:04:57,139
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of them would involve divesting from companies that are incredibly useful to invest in incredibly profitable some of the most successful companies in America.

680
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,663
[SPEAKER_05]: being speaking with about some of them.

681
01:05:00,684 --> 01:05:04,930
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also don't think it agrees with the city's narratives of fairness.

682
01:05:05,531 --> 01:05:13,802
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we have these values as Americans that we all want to, you know, support equal justice, equal rights, but a lot of what

683
01:05:14,463 --> 01:05:25,845
[SPEAKER_05]: people are going to feel as a result is a tangible result of passing this ordinance is going to cause real harm to the Jewish community of Medford and it would create a domino effect to the greater rest of the Commonwealth and to the country.

684
01:05:26,285 --> 01:05:32,826
[SPEAKER_05]: It is going to make Jewish residents, Israeli residents of Medford and around Massachusetts feel unsafe.

685
01:05:33,566 --> 01:05:41,548
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that, I'd like to read out loud a letter that was sent to the city council by the American Jewish committee.

686
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:45,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I urge the city council, unless I don't have the time.

687
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:55,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, ultimately, some of the companies that are listed here are, you know, Apple Nvidia Hewitt Packard Intel, these companies, they

688
01:05:56,407 --> 01:05:57,307
[SPEAKER_05]: are incredibly useful.

689
01:05:57,727 --> 01:06:09,011
[SPEAKER_05]: At the same time, if you're going to abstract the language to other countries, there are countries that we also would probably have a lot of trouble divesting from, namely China.

690
01:06:09,291 --> 01:06:13,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of our most successful companies are investing in China.

691
01:06:13,853 --> 01:06:21,796
[SPEAKER_05]: And those things are simply just not going to be feasible at the city level for us to really divest from.

692
01:06:22,576 --> 01:06:25,457
[SPEAKER_05]: And it wouldn't be budgetarily effective for the city.

693
01:06:26,097 --> 01:06:31,341
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll skip on the letter, but I have been aware that it's been delivered to your inboxes.

694
01:06:31,381 --> 01:06:32,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I do encourage you to read this.

695
01:06:33,103 --> 01:06:33,984
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for your time.

696
01:06:34,784 --> 01:06:35,765
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

697
01:06:40,269 --> 01:06:43,371
[SPEAKER_28]: Thought I saw a hand on Zoom, but it's gone down, so I'll go back to the podium.

698
01:06:43,411 --> 01:06:44,672
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

699
01:06:44,712 --> 01:06:45,333
[SPEAKER_28]: You have three minutes.

700
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Nick Julio 40 Robinson Road.

701
01:06:48,623 --> 01:06:53,629
[SPEAKER_06]: So, while I'm glad that we're not going to be taking a vote tonight on the value aligned ordinance.

702
01:06:54,430 --> 01:07:03,342
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think that decision to table discussion on it was pretty cowardly given there's an obvious presence, people here who are going to speak against it.

703
01:07:04,423 --> 01:07:13,768
[SPEAKER_06]: applaud the Councilor who voted against the motion table as well as moved to take public comment out of order.

704
01:07:13,828 --> 01:07:16,449
[SPEAKER_06]: So people do have that opportunity to voice their thoughts.

705
01:07:16,969 --> 01:07:22,532
[SPEAKER_06]: My comments, which I'm going to be discussing, we're assuming that we would be having that discussion tonight.

706
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:25,814
[SPEAKER_06]: So forgive me if they're a little off and some to some extent, but

707
01:07:26,914 --> 01:07:45,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very disappointed that, looking at the draft of the ordinance between the last public meeting and this one, that exactly zero changes were made, zero edits, despite extensive public comment at the last meeting from many people, including myself, who were critical of the language.

708
01:07:46,682 --> 01:07:55,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking just for me, I pointed out that subsection D of section 2-697, that's the part on divesting from human rights abusers,

709
01:07:56,062 --> 01:08:14,734
[SPEAKER_06]: is very disturbingly vague, and I've yet to receive an answer to the question I asked for the record at the last meeting on this, you know who makes a determination that a company or entity has severely violated, quoting from the ordinances drafted human rights and international humanitarian law as determined by international legal

710
01:08:15,816 --> 01:08:30,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Humanities bodies, including the United Nations, unquote, maybe it's implied that this would be the treasurer, based on the next section of the draft, but is the treasurer at all qualified to make this determination does she have a degree in international relations does she have a degree.

711
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:34,438
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, in or is she an international law attorney?

712
01:08:34,578 --> 01:08:45,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I call on all of you to ask the treasurer the next discussion to come here and actually provide some information as to will they be qualified at all to make these determinations.

713
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:48,474
[SPEAKER_06]: The ordinance calls for if the ordinance

714
01:08:49,075 --> 01:08:50,076
[SPEAKER_06]: or were to be approved.

715
01:08:50,796 --> 01:08:55,960
[SPEAKER_06]: So since it remains completely unchanged between the last meeting and this one, I have to oppose it in its entirety.

716
01:08:55,980 --> 01:09:00,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the vagueness and the overbreath is just going to open the door to political abuses.

717
01:09:00,824 --> 01:09:05,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And I definitely agree, this will include targeting based on religious affiliation.

718
01:09:05,548 --> 01:09:11,753
[SPEAKER_06]: So an absolute minimum, I'd hope the council, when this comes up again, would strike subsection D entirely.

719
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:18,564
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're not willing to do that, you definitely should not approve this ordinance until that language is made more specific.

720
01:09:19,285 --> 01:09:22,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I would ask, which companies and entities do you wanna sanction?

721
01:09:22,568 --> 01:09:23,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Name them explicitly.

722
01:09:24,249 --> 01:09:27,132
[SPEAKER_06]: If that includes the entire country of Israel, don't hide the ball.

723
01:09:27,792 --> 01:09:35,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of you have made it very clear your legislative intent is to target Israel, but at least own up to that and hear what the public has to say in response.

724
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:36,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

725
01:09:39,162 --> 01:09:39,562
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

726
01:09:41,817 --> 01:09:45,160
[SPEAKER_28]: We will go to Zachary Chertok on Zoom.

727
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,922
[SPEAKER_28]: Zachary, name and address for the record.

728
01:09:46,962 --> 01:09:47,622
[SPEAKER_28]: You have three minutes.

729
01:09:48,824 --> 01:09:50,625
[SPEAKER_44]: Zachary Chertok, 5 Almont Street.

730
01:09:52,067 --> 01:10:03,597
[SPEAKER_44]: I want to echo some of the financial and community concerns as well as the BDS concerns in Section D. I've talked to a lot of folks in the investor VC and PE communities.

731
01:10:05,385 --> 01:10:08,868
[SPEAKER_44]: that I know professionally and I've worked with both inside and outside the Jewish community.

732
01:10:08,908 --> 01:10:28,224
[SPEAKER_44]: They have both, they've all emphatically stated that the broad language used in this ordinance, not just in section D, but across the rest of it, will deter them from advising their portfolio companies to come anywhere near Medford in favor of more surrounding communities that don't target very severe restrictive financial measures in this case.

733
01:10:28,985 --> 01:10:33,649
[SPEAKER_44]: Similarly, I have put in comments and memoranda to the city council as well as the mayor's office

734
01:10:34,392 --> 01:10:43,077
[SPEAKER_44]: asking for if any financial or legal evaluation has been done as to the risks that this exposes the city to as well as the constraints and have not heard anything definitive back.

735
01:10:45,078 --> 01:11:00,788
[SPEAKER_44]: External analysis with colleagues out of Columbia SIPA have definitively noted that the broad language in here will basically severely restrict the city's ability to use investments as a non-tax source of revenue, basically rendering one of the only assets available as CDs.

736
01:11:01,581 --> 01:11:08,465
[SPEAKER_44]: Um, which according to section 55 in the mass general laws is not in the best financial interest of the city, um, towards maximum achievable returns.

737
01:11:09,385 --> 01:11:20,512
[SPEAKER_44]: Furthermore, I will echo the sentiments, uh, by Mr. Jaleo before me that, um, it's not really definitively clear as to whether the person who is tasked as being responsible with executing this.

738
01:11:21,132 --> 01:11:30,137
[SPEAKER_44]: Being the treasurer collector that they have the necessary FINRA financial or CPA certifications to be able to execute or provide this kind of financial advisory service.

739
01:11:31,549 --> 01:11:41,494
[SPEAKER_44]: And I would ask that the language be tightened up significantly and that we see a better updated draft that reflects several of the concerns here tonight, including my own sent to you and now spoken.

740
01:11:41,614 --> 01:11:41,994
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

741
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:44,636
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

742
01:11:44,656 --> 01:11:50,058
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll go back to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

743
01:11:50,118 --> 01:11:50,959
[SPEAKER_28]: And you'll have three minutes.

744
01:11:51,419 --> 01:11:54,941
[SPEAKER_19]: Barbara Rutstein, 16 Interrail Avenue, Medford.

745
01:11:58,242 --> 01:11:59,023
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm scared.

746
01:12:00,527 --> 01:12:02,848
[SPEAKER_19]: You have made me scared.

747
01:12:05,229 --> 01:12:07,469
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not speaking on the resolution.

748
01:12:07,629 --> 01:12:12,331
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm talking to you as a Jewish person who has been in Medford for over 50 years.

749
01:12:13,071 --> 01:12:17,153
[SPEAKER_19]: I've served on the Conservation Commission, the Recycling Commission.

750
01:12:17,613 --> 01:12:21,374
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a supporter of the library, Chevalier, M-Belt.

751
01:12:22,395 --> 01:12:29,417
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't, I have just been here for a while and never really been scared

752
01:12:30,702 --> 01:12:31,482
[SPEAKER_19]: to be Jewish.

753
01:12:33,743 --> 01:12:46,247
[SPEAKER_19]: But at the Embell picnic this past Saturday, I saw some bumper stickers on one car that was quite upsetting.

754
01:12:47,407 --> 01:12:49,268
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of them was a trope.

755
01:12:51,152 --> 01:13:04,522
[SPEAKER_19]: that was used in Germany about Jews ruling the world, but in this case it didn't say Jews ruled the world, it said America is ruled by Zionists.

756
01:13:05,662 --> 01:13:08,865
[SPEAKER_19]: Now you ask many, many people

757
01:13:09,714 --> 01:13:22,898
[SPEAKER_19]: and they are probably going to tell you that to them, there's no splitting of hairs or threading the needle, that there's no difference between Zionism and Judaism, Israelis, whatever.

758
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:25,279
[SPEAKER_19]: So I am scared.

759
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:39,524
[SPEAKER_19]: Two years ago, through the Jingle Bell Festival, my house was on the house tour because they had never had a house decorated for Hanukkah.

760
01:13:41,128 --> 01:13:49,414
[SPEAKER_19]: in the years that the Jingle Bell Festival has been in existence and has definitely raised good amounts of money.

761
01:13:49,434 --> 01:14:07,687
[SPEAKER_19]: But I can tell you today that if I were approached today and asked, do I want to open my house to the general public and support the Jingle Bell Festival by opening up my house to everyone, I would have to say, no, I'm too scared to do that.

762
01:14:09,775 --> 01:14:33,262
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't think that those of you who feel that this resolution is something that should be passed in its entirety, the way that it is written, I don't think that you recognize the repercussions because there are not many people who thread that needle about what Zionism is, what Judaism is, who threads that needle.

763
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,281
[SPEAKER_19]: I am scared.

764
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:40,783
[SPEAKER_19]: And all politics is local.

765
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:42,744
[SPEAKER_19]: Tip O'Neill.

766
01:14:45,186 --> 01:14:46,807
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is what's local to me.

767
01:14:48,788 --> 01:14:49,748
[SPEAKER_19]: It scares me.

768
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:55,572
[SPEAKER_19]: The resolution is not going to have an effect on what happens in Gaza.

769
01:14:57,773 --> 01:15:00,315
[SPEAKER_19]: In some sense, I think it's a lot of grandstanding.

770
01:15:03,845 --> 01:15:10,367
[SPEAKER_19]: And there have been many of us who have felt, well, you know, people own businesses.

771
01:15:11,327 --> 01:15:18,689
[SPEAKER_19]: They've held positions of responsibility in the community, just like 1933 in Germany.

772
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:21,230
[SPEAKER_19]: People own businesses.

773
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:24,351
[SPEAKER_19]: They have thousands of employees.

774
01:15:26,512 --> 01:15:32,017
[SPEAKER_19]: but the Jewish component stirs up anti-Semitism.

775
01:15:32,977 --> 01:15:37,521
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think that you mean to do that, but it happens.

776
01:15:38,702 --> 01:15:50,332
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was, again, I'll reference that bumper sticker, on my way to a picnic with my grandchildren at the Brooks Estates last Saturday.

777
01:15:51,656 --> 01:15:53,297
[SPEAKER_19]: My grandchildren were upset.

778
01:15:54,177 --> 01:15:55,037
[SPEAKER_19]: I was upset.

779
01:15:55,557 --> 01:16:01,859
[SPEAKER_19]: There was obviously nothing we could do, but it definitely stirred up that pot.

780
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,401
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want to continue to be scared.

781
01:16:08,161 --> 01:16:13,103
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't know what your resolution is going to be.

782
01:16:16,183 --> 01:16:24,965
[SPEAKER_19]: But I am scared, and I think that the proponents of this resolution don't understand the fear that some of us feel.

783
01:16:24,985 --> 01:16:31,707
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

784
01:16:32,467 --> 01:16:37,729
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm gonna go to Maria on Zoom, and then I'll come back to the podium, and then we can go to people who've already spoken once.

785
01:16:39,269 --> 01:16:41,210
[SPEAKER_28]: Maria, name and address for the record, please.

786
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:41,950
[SPEAKER_28]: You have three minutes.

787
01:16:47,992 --> 01:16:49,533
[SPEAKER_28]: Maria, I'm asking you to unmute.

788
01:16:49,993 --> 01:16:50,613
[SPEAKER_28]: There you go.

789
01:16:52,534 --> 01:16:52,834
[SPEAKER_42]: OK.

790
01:16:53,514 --> 01:16:56,595
[SPEAKER_42]: Maria Sullivan, 27 Dudley Street, Medford.

791
01:16:57,355 --> 01:16:57,916
[SPEAKER_42]: Good evening.

792
01:16:58,796 --> 01:17:02,317
[SPEAKER_42]: And again, I am also going to talk about the values aligned ordinance.

793
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:04,218
[SPEAKER_42]: Consider this.

794
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:10,961
[SPEAKER_42]: If someone in Massachusetts mines granite and uses it to make a countertop for their home, that's fine.

795
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:14,742
[SPEAKER_42]: If they sell granite to feed their family, good.

796
01:17:15,522 --> 01:17:19,485
[SPEAKER_42]: If a local person sets up a company and hires workers, that's fine.

797
01:17:20,226 --> 01:17:35,617
[SPEAKER_42]: If an international company buys land in Massachusetts and hires Massachusetts miners and sells the granite, is it investing in our infrastructure and creating US jobs or is it exploiting our natural resources?

798
01:17:37,239 --> 01:17:40,221
[SPEAKER_42]: You and the treasurer were not elected to make this decision.

799
01:17:41,371 --> 01:18:04,048
[SPEAKER_42]: If it were not Massachusetts, but it were a company making widgets, or extracting oil in Ukraine, or Sudan, or Nigeria, or maybe even Hong Kong, or any disputed area which might be deemed illegal occupation, or an apartheid country such as South Africa, there's so much risk and uncertainty.

800
01:18:04,989 --> 01:18:09,132
[SPEAKER_42]: Don't we want to reward the companies who have the courage to create employment

801
01:18:09,515 --> 01:18:12,998
[SPEAKER_42]: with decent jobs for the regular people who live there?

802
01:18:14,799 --> 01:18:17,622
[SPEAKER_42]: You and the treasurer were not elected to make that decision.

803
01:18:19,884 --> 01:18:29,432
[SPEAKER_42]: If the Medford treasurer simply invests our funds in the S&P 500, that is arguably the 500 most popular stocks in the United States.

804
01:18:30,412 --> 01:18:35,917
[SPEAKER_42]: Under this proposal, it would be illegal because of Apple, Intel, Samsung, and Caterpillar, plus many others.

805
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:44,019
[SPEAKER_42]: Those companies have sourced or supplied materials in areas of conflict which have contributed to the named violations.

806
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:57,282
[SPEAKER_42]: Under the spirit of this proposal, Medford would need to throw away its phones, computers, refrigerators, and lawnmowers, plus track the sources of the fuel used in our trucks and buses.

807
01:18:58,382 --> 01:19:01,223
[SPEAKER_42]: You and the treasurer were not elected to make these decisions.

808
01:19:02,663 --> 01:19:03,683
[SPEAKER_42]: How about simply

809
01:19:04,335 --> 01:19:07,757
[SPEAKER_42]: investing in United States treasury bills or treasury notes.

810
01:19:08,657 --> 01:19:19,002
[SPEAKER_42]: I can imagine that there are city council members who believe our federal government in the United States commits crimes against humanity and illegal occupation.

811
01:19:20,382 --> 01:19:23,464
[SPEAKER_42]: You and our treasurer were not elected to make this decision.

812
01:19:24,488 --> 01:19:26,209
[SPEAKER_42]: Please focus on Medford.

813
01:19:26,549 --> 01:19:28,670
[SPEAKER_42]: We need fiscal responsibility.

814
01:19:29,571 --> 01:19:31,292
[SPEAKER_42]: Our world is so complicated.

815
01:19:32,012 --> 01:19:43,078
[SPEAKER_42]: Medford employees don't have the time or the expertise to decide how to implement section D as in dog of the proposal in accordance with the wishes of the voters.

816
01:19:44,458 --> 01:19:52,763
[SPEAKER_42]: I heard earlier today that there are 7,000 emails to you on this controversial no-win situation topic.

817
01:19:53,806 --> 01:19:58,008
[SPEAKER_42]: Please don't handicap our treasurer or burden our treasurer with this.

818
01:19:58,909 --> 01:20:04,552
[SPEAKER_42]: I move that paragraph D, as in dog, be deleted from this proposal.

819
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:06,013
[SPEAKER_42]: Do I hear a second?

820
01:20:12,117 --> 01:20:14,558
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your time and your comment.

821
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:16,399
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll go back to the podium.

822
01:20:16,899 --> 01:20:18,280
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

823
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,081
[SPEAKER_28]: You have three minutes.

824
01:20:19,861 --> 01:20:22,643
[SPEAKER_46]: Rabbi Jessica Dallara, One Hammond Place, Medford.

825
01:20:23,924 --> 01:20:31,226
[SPEAKER_46]: I am also disappointed that I see no effort has been made to amend the problems with Section D that I and many others pointed out last time.

826
01:20:31,266 --> 01:20:33,266
[SPEAKER_46]: There's no criteria for determining it.

827
01:20:33,946 --> 01:20:36,567
[SPEAKER_46]: There's no list of permissible and impermissible companies.

828
01:20:36,607 --> 01:20:40,628
[SPEAKER_46]: There's no process defined for appeal or review of such designations.

829
01:20:41,028 --> 01:20:49,190
[SPEAKER_46]: No attempt to allay the concerns that I and my community have brought up about that this will be unevenly applied, primarily or exclusively targeting Israel.

830
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:57,132
[SPEAKER_46]: I didn't want to be this pedantic, but you didn't even fix the typo that it would be determined by international humanities organizations instead of humanitarian.

831
01:20:57,632 --> 01:21:03,034
[SPEAKER_46]: What are we going to ask the Modern Language Association, the International Baccalaureate, to decide what we should be investing in?

832
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:15,957
[SPEAKER_46]: Last time I felt obligated to speak on behalf of those members of my Temple Shalom community who were and continue to be alarmed that enshrining even a vague backdoor BDS into the law of our city has the potential to endanger Jewish residents.

833
01:21:16,517 --> 01:21:33,305
[SPEAKER_46]: Tonight I speak on behalf of the moderate middle the majority of my congregants who hold tight, the increasingly counter cultural values of nuance and compassion, the thoughtful liberal to progressive politically active congregants who otherwise cheer on much of the work of the city council.

834
01:21:33,965 --> 01:21:40,226
[SPEAKER_46]: but who will not be goaded into trying to prove we're one of the good Jews by turning our backs on Israel.

835
01:21:40,847 --> 01:21:51,349
[SPEAKER_46]: I personally, as the rabbi of the only synagogue here in Medford, cannot stand silent to allow a bad ordinance to enshrine disguised anti-Israel posturing into the law of our city.

836
01:21:51,889 --> 01:22:03,292
[SPEAKER_46]: That obligation as a Jewish leader is independent from my own personal opinions, either about Israel or about the other provisions of this ordinance, many of which I and a majority of my congregants would actually support.

837
01:22:04,172 --> 01:22:25,562
[SPEAKER_46]: It is not only possible but common in my Temple Shalom community to hold on to the humanity on both sides of the terrible conflict between Israel and Gaza, to weep not only for the remaining 48 hostages still held captive by Hamas, but for all of the suffering and displacement and loss that has plagued Israel and Gaza and the wider region since October 7, 2023.

838
01:22:27,563 --> 01:22:37,165
[SPEAKER_46]: Those wearing keffiyehs with their kippahs have never had a monopoly on the Jewish value of rachamim, compassion, nor on shalom, a desire for morally acceptable peace.

839
01:22:38,445 --> 01:22:54,568
[SPEAKER_46]: But this ordinance seeks to shoehorn me and my congregants into a false binary where we either must prove our progressive bona fides by allowing Israel to be targeted here in all but name, or we are officially putting ourselves outside the boundaries of Medford values.

840
01:22:55,228 --> 01:23:05,097
[SPEAKER_46]: I reject that premise fundamentally, I am pushing back against this ordinance because of my Jewish values and because of my civic values as an American and a Medford homeowner.

841
01:23:05,538 --> 01:23:14,967
[SPEAKER_46]: This ordinance is badly worded liable to endless and expensive legal challenge, ensure to change nothing on the ground overseas, its main impact will be symbolic.

842
01:23:15,367 --> 01:23:22,173
[SPEAKER_46]: telling all of us Jews whose opinion of Israel goes anything beyond a reactive and un-nuanced antipathy that we do not belong here.

843
01:23:22,534 --> 01:23:29,059
[SPEAKER_46]: It erases us from the narrative of our city, just as surely as the name Yisrael has been erased from the text of this measure.

844
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:41,150
[SPEAKER_46]: Until and unless Section D is removed or substantially amended to allay the concerns that I and my congregants have now repeatedly raised, I must continue to oppose this measure, which does not align with my values.

845
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:41,711
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

846
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:46,271
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you for your comments.

847
01:23:48,094 --> 01:23:50,797
[SPEAKER_35]: We will go to Zoom.

848
01:23:50,897 --> 01:23:52,279
[SPEAKER_28]: We have David Lifter.

849
01:23:52,379 --> 01:23:55,063
[SPEAKER_28]: David, name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

850
01:23:59,584 --> 01:23:59,984
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

851
01:24:00,004 --> 01:24:01,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, my name is David Lichter.

852
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:05,029
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a Somerville resident, 9 Belmont Place.

853
01:24:05,789 --> 01:24:11,274
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm here, I wasn't planning on speaking, but I just wanted to, so I don't have prepared remarks.

854
01:24:11,514 --> 01:24:13,356
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to give you a flavor.

855
01:24:13,376 --> 01:24:20,682
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to speak in favor of my fellow supporters there in the room who are brave enough to speak out against this resolution.

856
01:24:20,702 --> 01:24:22,123
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to give you a flavor of what

857
01:24:22,884 --> 01:24:26,227
[SPEAKER_14]: The practicality of doing this has done in Somerville.

858
01:24:26,767 --> 01:24:33,893
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to relay back earlier comments to Mr. Kesselman about speaking about his his child.

859
01:24:34,554 --> 01:24:37,236
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a daughter in the school system, a young nine year old.

860
01:24:37,496 --> 01:24:44,803
[SPEAKER_14]: And what we see around Somerville every single day, because we have a BDS measure on our ballot in November.

861
01:24:45,463 --> 01:24:57,486
[SPEAKER_14]: is harassment, intimidation of community members with chants, public slogans, kathiyas everywhere, storming city hall, trying to intimidate our mayor, our city councillors.

862
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:04,648
[SPEAKER_14]: And what this often comes from in a very uncivilized and disrespectful way is anti-Israel rhetoric,

863
01:25:05,268 --> 01:25:07,069
[SPEAKER_14]: which is anti-American.

864
01:25:07,609 --> 01:25:08,829
[SPEAKER_14]: It's disrespectful.

865
01:25:09,389 --> 01:25:10,650
[SPEAKER_14]: It's discriminatory.

866
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:16,312
[SPEAKER_14]: And BDS, by that nature, is promoting narratives of terrorist organizations.

867
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:18,293
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't belong in our community.

868
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:21,354
[SPEAKER_14]: There are better ways to unite the community than this.

869
01:25:21,754 --> 01:25:28,416
[SPEAKER_14]: I speak very strongly against this, and I urge the committee to learn from the example going on in Somerville.

870
01:25:28,436 --> 01:25:31,437
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just down the road, and we see this hate every single day.

871
01:25:31,537 --> 01:25:32,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your time.

872
01:25:32,398 --> 01:25:33,118
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it.

873
01:25:39,116 --> 01:25:39,876
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

874
01:25:39,916 --> 01:25:41,056
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll go back to the podium.

875
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:42,417
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

876
01:25:42,457 --> 01:25:43,217
[SPEAKER_28]: You have three minutes.

877
01:25:45,217 --> 01:25:46,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

878
01:25:46,538 --> 01:25:48,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Gaston Fiore 61, Stigney Road.

879
01:25:48,438 --> 01:25:52,039
[SPEAKER_07]: So I oppose this so-called values-aligned investment audience.

880
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:54,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I spoke against it last time, so I'm not going to repeat myself.

881
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,080
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to ask a few questions about what happened.

882
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,941
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first one is that

883
01:26:01,141 --> 01:26:02,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Paragraph D was mentioned.

884
01:26:02,802 --> 01:26:08,826
[SPEAKER_07]: I also mentioned Paragraph C because it says any companies that derive any of its revenue, that's even $1.

885
01:26:09,046 --> 01:26:12,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we like weather satellites or we don't want any more weather satellites?

886
01:26:12,428 --> 01:26:16,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we're not going to be able to invest in any companies that, for example, manufacture weather satellites.

887
01:26:16,651 --> 01:26:18,292
[SPEAKER_07]: And as some other people have mentioned,

888
01:26:19,092 --> 01:26:32,565
[SPEAKER_07]: even companies that produce applications or the electronics that we use on a daily basis would fall under this category as well because it's even $1 that they get out of weapons of any kind, including defense contractors, then we can invest.

889
01:26:33,065 --> 01:26:39,411
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is against our national security, the US national security.

890
01:26:41,633 --> 01:26:46,216
[SPEAKER_07]: it's also against our finances, which after all is taxpayers money.

891
01:26:46,716 --> 01:26:52,520
[SPEAKER_07]: So I also would like to point out that there have been no change in this audience since last time to this time.

892
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,521
[SPEAKER_07]: So it goes postpone again.

893
01:26:54,621 --> 01:26:59,104
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm sure you know, everyone here, we make an effort, we love coming here, we do.

894
01:26:59,544 --> 01:27:04,407
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's also like, you know, it's a little bit taxing, like tomorrow, we have to come again, because we have to discuss zoning.

895
01:27:04,808 --> 01:27:06,189
[SPEAKER_07]: So um, you know, I

896
01:27:06,949 --> 01:27:14,074
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just a little bit frustrated that things get put in the agenda and then they get postponed to September or to some future meeting that we have no idea about.

897
01:27:14,735 --> 01:27:16,036
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would like that to end.

898
01:27:17,917 --> 01:27:22,521
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would also like to mention that, you know, so

899
01:27:23,994 --> 01:27:30,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a little bit, I'm not sure about this resident support of this, as was mentioned earlier.

900
01:27:31,044 --> 01:27:35,510
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would like to remind everyone that we live in a democratic system, at least up to now.

901
01:27:35,570 --> 01:27:39,956
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, so people get elected, and they need to work for all of the city.

902
01:27:40,116 --> 01:27:47,921
[SPEAKER_07]: not a special interest group, not a very small proportion, and in the best case scenario for all of us, and in the worst case scenario for the people that have voted for some of you.

903
01:27:48,001 --> 01:27:58,649
[SPEAKER_07]: And I remind that participation in local elections covers around 30%, and then no one gets 100% or 30%, which means that overall, the people that have voted for you, it's like probably around a quarter.

904
01:27:59,229 --> 01:28:04,533
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can't imagine that a quarter of those, if all of those people actually support this kind of voting.

905
01:28:04,553 --> 01:28:07,335
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, I just feel that,

906
01:28:08,196 --> 01:28:12,057
[SPEAKER_07]: we need to do a little bit of a better job at sort of listening to the whole city.

907
01:28:12,077 --> 01:28:16,279
[SPEAKER_07]: What has happened to all the comments that were heard last time, my comment included, and everyone else's.

908
01:28:16,539 --> 01:28:18,600
[SPEAKER_07]: The comments today, the comments that are going to happen next week.

909
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the audience still going to look the same, or is it going to change?

910
01:28:21,161 --> 01:28:24,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Is someone going to address what we're saying, or nothing is going to change?

911
01:28:24,262 --> 01:28:29,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Because otherwise, you should just tell us, like, you know, high-quality participation, and then just pass whatever you want to pass.

912
01:28:30,264 --> 01:28:31,644
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it would have the same effect.

913
01:28:31,904 --> 01:28:35,386
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you so much for listening.

914
01:28:35,406 --> 01:28:36,226
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

915
01:28:37,032 --> 01:28:38,353
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll go to Zoom.

916
01:28:38,533 --> 01:28:40,253
[SPEAKER_28]: I see PBB on Zoom.

917
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:42,855
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll unmute you and you'll have three minutes.

918
01:28:43,135 --> 01:28:44,855
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

919
01:28:47,637 --> 01:28:48,997
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, we can't hear you.

920
01:28:49,538 --> 01:28:50,918
[SPEAKER_28]: Let me request an unmute again.

921
01:28:50,938 --> 01:28:52,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, got it.

922
01:28:52,139 --> 01:28:53,279
[SPEAKER_28]: There you go.

923
01:28:53,479 --> 01:28:54,260
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address the record.

924
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:54,980
[SPEAKER_28]: You have three minutes.

925
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Patricia Brady, Dougherty, 190 High Street, Medford.

926
01:28:58,201 --> 01:29:01,083
[SPEAKER_11]: I turned this on to watch what was going to happen to the rezoning.

927
01:29:02,043 --> 01:29:03,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead, I'm watching this.

928
01:29:04,324 --> 01:29:05,244
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so horrible.

929
01:29:05,264 --> 01:29:06,185
[SPEAKER_11]: This is horrifying.

930
01:29:07,202 --> 01:29:18,568
[SPEAKER_11]: To think that you have put longtime senior citizen residents, actually of all ages, at risk, and to think they feel the need to come up and say to you, I'm afraid.

931
01:29:18,808 --> 01:29:23,591
[SPEAKER_11]: For Barbara Rutstein to have to come up here and tell you that is horrifying.

932
01:29:23,851 --> 01:29:26,673
[SPEAKER_11]: This is so embarrassing for the city of Medford.

933
01:29:28,094 --> 01:29:30,415
[SPEAKER_11]: You shouldn't be laying this on the table.

934
01:29:30,455 --> 01:29:31,956
[SPEAKER_11]: You shouldn't be continuing this.

935
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:38,143
[SPEAKER_11]: You should be having a motion tonight to end it tonight.

936
01:29:39,484 --> 01:29:41,025
[SPEAKER_11]: You people ought to be embarrassed.

937
01:29:42,226 --> 01:29:42,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

938
01:29:49,691 --> 01:29:50,131
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

939
01:29:50,191 --> 01:29:54,274
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll return to the podium, but I want to get folks who haven't had a chance to speak yet, Sharon.

940
01:29:54,394 --> 01:29:58,717
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm going to go, sorry, did you speak during public participation?

941
01:30:00,651 --> 01:30:01,232
[SPEAKER_28]: on the zoning?

942
01:30:01,752 --> 01:30:02,432
[SPEAKER_28]: No, you didn't Melanie.

943
01:30:02,452 --> 01:30:03,253
[SPEAKER_28]: So we'll take you first.

944
01:30:03,513 --> 01:30:03,934
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

945
01:30:05,695 --> 01:30:07,416
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, no, I know you hadn't spoken yet.

946
01:30:07,637 --> 01:30:09,618
[SPEAKER_28]: Give me one second to reset the timer.

947
01:30:10,379 --> 01:30:14,982
[SPEAKER_28]: And then for anyone who's already had a chance to speak, we'll come back around to you for one more minute if you'd like.

948
01:30:17,204 --> 01:30:18,285
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

949
01:30:18,575 --> 01:30:20,757
[SPEAKER_23]: Melanie Tringali, 116 Forest Street.

950
01:30:21,938 --> 01:30:23,739
[SPEAKER_23]: I wasn't going to comment tonight on this at all.

951
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:30,424
[SPEAKER_23]: My original comment was about this ordinance and the council's fiduciary responsibility to the city of Medford.

952
01:30:30,965 --> 01:30:39,171
[SPEAKER_23]: It's your fiduciary responsibility who oversees the budget to make sure that we have right investments and bring us a good return on our money.

953
01:30:39,271 --> 01:30:43,694
[SPEAKER_23]: But then listening to these stories and these people who are afraid and upset

954
01:30:44,974 --> 01:30:56,122
[SPEAKER_23]: The gentleman from Somerville who called in talking about the hate that he's witnessing in Somerville and what's happening over there should be enough for you people to make these changes to these ordinances.

955
01:30:56,843 --> 01:31:06,169
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, other than the fiduciary responsibility to the city of Medford and its residents, but also for all these other residents who don't support this at all and are afraid.

956
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:10,352
[SPEAKER_23]: I really would recommend that you reconsider it altogether.

957
01:31:10,512 --> 01:31:10,873
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

958
01:31:11,993 --> 01:31:12,354
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

959
01:31:15,432 --> 01:31:21,857
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, seeing no new hands on Zoom, we'll stay at the podium for folks who haven't had a chance to speak yet.

960
01:31:23,017 --> 01:31:24,979
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record and you'll have three minutes.

961
01:31:27,713 --> 01:31:28,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, council.

962
01:31:28,454 --> 01:31:29,695
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Judy Beatrice.

963
01:31:30,175 --> 01:31:32,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm chairman of the Commissioners Trust Funds.

964
01:31:32,957 --> 01:31:36,500
[SPEAKER_01]: We manage and I do share responsibility to invest such funds.

965
01:31:37,141 --> 01:31:42,124
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to say that this particular document, I have looked hard.

966
01:31:42,645 --> 01:31:46,448
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks to me like it was rewritten from one of the Boston documents on divestment.

967
01:31:46,888 --> 01:31:50,951
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did notice when I was going through the Boston, I said it does not apply to Boston.

968
01:31:51,752 --> 01:31:53,694
[SPEAKER_01]: My mate, there's enough people talking here about it.

969
01:31:53,754 --> 01:32:04,584
[SPEAKER_01]: My concern and from my point of view of manager and we have the fiduciary responsibility for all the trust funds is the fact it says no public funds, no public funds, no public funds and no public funds.

970
01:32:05,545 --> 01:32:09,749
[SPEAKER_01]: The only public funds that I know currently that exist in the city are tax receipts,

971
01:32:10,555 --> 01:32:13,456
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got the Inflation Reduction Act, you have money from me, that's a grant.

972
01:32:13,636 --> 01:32:14,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are public funds.

973
01:32:15,497 --> 01:32:23,661
[SPEAKER_01]: The funds that we manage or that your pension fund manage, they are not public funds by statute, by Massachusetts statute and by ours.

974
01:32:24,242 --> 01:32:32,846
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there really needs to be some serious consideration about the verbiage of this particular bill that it really doesn't really match, I think, what you're trying to accomplish.

975
01:32:33,206 --> 01:32:39,809
[SPEAKER_01]: It will cause, well, I can tell you very frankly, the commissioners, we will disagree with the fact that our funds are public, they are not.

976
01:32:40,249 --> 01:32:43,591
[SPEAKER_01]: we operate under fiduciary rules and therefore, and the Prudent Investment Act.

977
01:32:43,911 --> 01:33:02,842
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have managed the fund appropriately to make sure that there are funds available as given by the various trusts that we operate for the benefit of whom they wanted to be beneficiaries of those funds, including and not unlimited to the perpetual care of the cemetery, which goes into your budget to the tune of 200,000 plus every single year by our management.

978
01:33:03,222 --> 01:33:06,804
[SPEAKER_01]: And by having taken over that fund years ago and straightening it out,

979
01:33:07,364 --> 01:33:10,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Formerly, when I first was on this committee, it was all invested in bonds.

980
01:33:11,745 --> 01:33:16,387
[SPEAKER_01]: And in bonds, it was great because if you bought a bond in 1986, they were paying 10, 12, 13%.

981
01:33:16,787 --> 01:33:20,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess what happened when they all came through 30 years later?

982
01:33:21,488 --> 01:33:22,348
[SPEAKER_01]: They were worth nothing.

983
01:33:22,768 --> 01:33:32,491
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, that fund, which was supposed to take care of perpetual care and your budget, was down to nothing when we took it over because there were no 15, 20% bonds out there.

984
01:33:32,931 --> 01:33:34,632
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a process of investing.

985
01:33:35,310 --> 01:33:43,184
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you really need to have some serious, I'm very happy to be available to you and go through this as to what is needed, but you need to have a serious consideration.

986
01:33:43,545 --> 01:33:47,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I did recall the other night that somebody mentioned the main divestment.

987
01:33:47,892 --> 01:33:48,653
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and looked it up.

988
01:33:49,642 --> 01:33:55,805
[SPEAKER_01]: The main divestment ordinance, and I read it very carefully, it doesn't sound like this at all.

989
01:33:56,225 --> 01:34:02,567
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it makes a very specific, and they mean it, they're talking specifically in this case about the retirement pension funds.

990
01:34:03,048 --> 01:34:13,312
[SPEAKER_01]: And they make the point very clearly that in the process of doing it, that they measure time, benefit, risk, in terms of the process of how they unwind and what they do.

991
01:34:14,092 --> 01:34:21,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you may not realize that most of the time these ESG funds have been invested by private equity, because your average fund can't do that.

992
01:34:21,594 --> 01:34:23,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Private equity funds are very risky.

993
01:34:24,055 --> 01:34:27,676
[SPEAKER_01]: They have what we call a J curve, which means, oh, think of the steward hospitals.

994
01:34:27,696 --> 01:34:29,436
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another example of a private equity.

995
01:34:29,816 --> 01:34:35,498
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you first invest, they collect money from other people, and they invest it in, hopefully, in things that will return an investment.

996
01:34:35,918 --> 01:34:43,106
[SPEAKER_01]: The J curb goes down which means it's not making any money and you have to wait for the tail to come back up to make it and then they throw all the money out.

997
01:34:43,527 --> 01:34:53,878
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really clear from reading the main the main divestment that they were waiting because they had to wait because they did equity investments they were still waiting till 28 to unwind that.

998
01:34:54,579 --> 01:34:55,580
[SPEAKER_01]: We as commissioners

999
01:34:56,487 --> 01:35:10,922
[SPEAKER_01]: And with our investment managers, we make decisions every single quarter, sometimes more often, particularly in 220 and 221 and 222, because of the needs to adjust what you need for your budget, what our trusts need for their trust, what they're going to distribute money for.

1000
01:35:11,423 --> 01:35:12,504
[SPEAKER_01]: We make those decisions.

1001
01:35:13,004 --> 01:35:14,066
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not a public fund.

1002
01:35:15,368 --> 01:35:20,376
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe you need to reconsider the verbiage of this and not have any, there is problems with the verbiage in this.

1003
01:35:20,436 --> 01:35:25,163
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need to have a table so we have, and I'm very happy to talk with any of you at any time, as are my members.

1004
01:35:25,423 --> 01:35:26,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

1005
01:35:26,385 --> 01:35:28,488
[SPEAKER_28]: Thanks Judy, just if I could for one second.

1006
01:35:30,436 --> 01:35:35,180
[SPEAKER_28]: I've been trying to meet with you through the administration for several months, and I didn't get connected.

1007
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:35,921
[SPEAKER_01]: I work for the city.

1008
01:35:35,961 --> 01:35:36,321
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

1009
01:35:36,501 --> 01:35:36,722
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

1010
01:35:36,962 --> 01:35:37,763
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why I sent it.

1011
01:35:37,783 --> 01:35:38,683
[SPEAKER_01]: But feel free to call me.

1012
01:35:38,723 --> 01:35:39,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I don't.

1013
01:35:39,544 --> 01:35:40,425
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get the message.

1014
01:35:40,525 --> 01:35:45,309
[SPEAKER_28]: I spoke with Judy today, Judy Johnston, and we're going to set up a meeting with you to talk about something.

1015
01:35:45,329 --> 01:35:45,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

1016
01:35:46,030 --> 01:35:46,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.

1017
01:35:46,671 --> 01:35:46,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1018
01:35:47,031 --> 01:35:54,798
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there anyone who hasn't had a chance to speak yet who would like to speak in public participation?

1019
01:35:59,083 --> 01:36:02,047
[SPEAKER_28]: going to go to Zoom and then I'll come back to the podium.

1020
01:36:02,688 --> 01:36:06,013
[SPEAKER_28]: You've raised your hands at the same well, period at the same time.

1021
01:36:06,754 --> 01:36:09,217
[SPEAKER_28]: Going to go to Meryl Pearlson, name and address for the record, please.

1022
01:36:09,237 --> 01:36:09,999
[SPEAKER_28]: You have three minutes.

1023
01:36:12,738 --> 01:36:16,783
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi, I'm Morell Carlson I live at 97 be Boston Avenue.

1024
01:36:17,443 --> 01:36:33,162
[SPEAKER_34]: I actually did not prepare to speak on this tonight I too was coming to just hear what was going on with the zoning amendments and, but I feel compelled to speak about the values aligned ordinance.

1025
01:36:34,222 --> 01:36:37,623
[SPEAKER_34]: and which I just hurriedly referenced and read through.

1026
01:36:37,783 --> 01:36:51,948
[SPEAKER_34]: And let's not kid ourselves about paragraph D. The language in there is clearly intended as dog whistle words copied directly from BDS organizations that have been at least honestly more explicit about their anti-Israel agenda.

1027
01:36:53,428 --> 01:36:58,210
[SPEAKER_34]: Hearing that there's been no change since the last public discussion on this is disheartening.

1028
01:36:59,850 --> 01:37:09,212
[SPEAKER_34]: Mr. Kesselman expressed that those arguments, those arguing against the ordinance are perpetuating a false equivalency between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism.

1029
01:37:09,292 --> 01:37:17,233
[SPEAKER_34]: But this equivalency is something that every Jewish person, including myself, lives with every day, regardless of our political stances.

1030
01:37:17,734 --> 01:37:18,894
[SPEAKER_34]: It's been thrust on us.

1031
01:37:19,934 --> 01:37:24,855
[SPEAKER_34]: And please know also that as a parent, I greatly sympathize with your fears, with your concerns.

1032
01:37:24,895 --> 01:37:25,295
[SPEAKER_34]: In fact,

1033
01:37:26,436 --> 01:37:39,054
[SPEAKER_34]: When my son went through Medford public schools with several members on this council, he experienced anti semitism, and I don't want us to kid ourselves that it can't happen here.

1034
01:37:39,074 --> 01:37:39,154
[SPEAKER_34]: So I.

1035
01:37:42,198 --> 01:37:45,780
[SPEAKER_34]: and I also am aware of many recent incidents in other communities.

1036
01:37:46,681 --> 01:37:56,968
[SPEAKER_34]: Aside from the disguised agenda, the vagary of the language is clearly problematic as we're hearing from people who have expertise in finance and investment.

1037
01:37:57,688 --> 01:38:08,195
[SPEAKER_34]: And mostly I just want to say that I think there's so much great going on in Medford and I think there's also a lot of needs that Medford has to have addressed and this

1038
01:38:09,294 --> 01:38:18,216
[SPEAKER_34]: just seems like it is coming from an external agenda that maybe we need to take care of more business at home first.

1039
01:38:18,376 --> 01:38:21,316
[SPEAKER_34]: So thank you for allowing my impromptu remarks.

1040
01:38:23,737 --> 01:38:24,677
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

1041
01:38:24,697 --> 01:38:31,258
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to go back to the podium for anyone who hasn't had a chance to speak yet.

1042
01:38:31,779 --> 01:38:33,059
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

1043
01:38:33,099 --> 01:38:33,819
[SPEAKER_28]: You have three minutes.

1044
01:38:35,234 --> 01:38:36,976
[SPEAKER_30]: Name Aaron, 373 Riverside Ave.

1045
01:38:37,816 --> 01:38:42,460
[SPEAKER_30]: I too am disappointed that you're actually not taking like actual comments for this tonight.

1046
01:38:43,161 --> 01:38:46,043
[SPEAKER_30]: I know this is public comment period, but it is kind of cowardly.

1047
01:38:46,063 --> 01:38:46,924
[SPEAKER_30]: So I'm gonna second that.

1048
01:38:47,465 --> 01:38:52,249
[SPEAKER_30]: This ordinance does not align to my values as a citizen for a number of reasons.

1049
01:38:52,829 --> 01:39:00,676
[SPEAKER_30]: So I'm sorry if that bores you all and you've heard it all before, but it's more than just subsection D. This is a trash ordinance.

1050
01:39:01,317 --> 01:39:02,638
[SPEAKER_30]: And again, you've divided the city.

1051
01:39:03,730 --> 01:39:05,391
[SPEAKER_30]: This whole thing should just be tossed out.

1052
01:39:06,171 --> 01:39:15,514
[SPEAKER_30]: You have a Councilor here who's in the Navy, and I don't understand why defense contractors that make defensive weapons are bad.

1053
01:39:16,074 --> 01:39:18,195
[SPEAKER_30]: Is it because the military who uses them?

1054
01:39:18,795 --> 01:39:21,356
[SPEAKER_30]: Is it the fact that we don't defend ourselves with bubbles?

1055
01:39:22,676 --> 01:39:23,417
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't understand.

1056
01:39:24,077 --> 01:39:29,559
[SPEAKER_30]: Do you not invest in DJI, which is a drone company, because those can be used as offensive weapons?

1057
01:39:30,139 --> 01:39:32,720
[SPEAKER_30]: There's a company called Raytheon that some of you may have heard of.

1058
01:39:33,635 --> 01:39:38,576
[SPEAKER_30]: They have offshoots in Cambridge, so that's kind of a local company, as well as North Andover.

1059
01:39:38,616 --> 01:39:40,257
[SPEAKER_30]: In fact, they pay for the schools there.

1060
01:39:41,217 --> 01:39:43,658
[SPEAKER_30]: Does everyone who works at Raytheon, are they a baby killer?

1061
01:39:44,858 --> 01:39:49,959
[SPEAKER_30]: Most of you weren't alive in the 70s when folks like my dad were coming home from Vietnam.

1062
01:39:50,599 --> 01:39:54,680
[SPEAKER_30]: He didn't want to go to that war, but he was spit on and called a baby killer.

1063
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:55,381
[SPEAKER_30]: He was a medic.

1064
01:39:56,261 --> 01:39:57,121
[SPEAKER_30]: He saved lives.

1065
01:39:58,281 --> 01:40:00,742
[SPEAKER_30]: You don't know the consequences of what you're writing in here.

1066
01:40:01,583 --> 01:40:11,726
[SPEAKER_30]: And if your values are so hard up on that and it's because this government for whatever reason does anything offensive and not strictly defensive, I don't know.

1067
01:40:12,027 --> 01:40:13,507
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, put your money where your mouth is.

1068
01:40:13,627 --> 01:40:19,429
[SPEAKER_30]: Maybe one of the councilors should resign his commission then if he really feels that strongly about this and that's his values.

1069
01:40:20,649 --> 01:40:29,132
[SPEAKER_30]: This whole thing is not the values of the city, just a subset, a select few of you that decided to take this up and divide the city.

1070
01:40:29,672 --> 01:40:30,953
[SPEAKER_30]: Congrats, it's still working.

1071
01:40:34,183 --> 01:40:35,183
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

1072
01:40:36,124 --> 01:40:37,485
[SPEAKER_28]: We're gonna go back to Zoom.

1073
01:40:37,545 --> 01:40:38,665
[SPEAKER_28]: We have been near Germanus.

1074
01:40:39,125 --> 01:40:40,486
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

1075
01:40:40,526 --> 01:40:41,266
[SPEAKER_28]: You have three minutes.

1076
01:40:44,208 --> 01:40:46,289
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, excuse me, it's taking me a bit to unmute.

1077
01:40:46,309 --> 01:40:51,011
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm not sure I agree with some of the comments that I'm hearing.

1078
01:41:00,693 --> 01:41:03,974
[SPEAKER_40]: This ordinance does indeed reflect our values.

1079
01:41:05,175 --> 01:41:21,181
[SPEAKER_40]: And if somebody is nitpicking about one part of the ordinance that happens to, in their mind, apply to a specific state, that is something else.

1080
01:41:22,001 --> 01:41:23,542
[SPEAKER_40]: This applies to any state.

1081
01:41:25,138 --> 01:41:34,324
[SPEAKER_40]: And the values that are reflected in all the parts of this ordinance are indeed values to be commended.

1082
01:41:35,665 --> 01:41:53,098
[SPEAKER_40]: And we should not necessarily just follow the leads of a government that just happens to make decisions that are based on how much money they're gonna make out of the weapon manufacturers.

1083
01:41:53,858 --> 01:41:54,258
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay?

1084
01:41:55,579 --> 01:42:15,164
[SPEAKER_40]: It's a fact, and you've heard it in the news, that even some of our elected officials are making money investing in these weapon-producing companies, okay, based on the playing around of the stock market that's happening.

1085
01:42:15,945 --> 01:42:20,206
[SPEAKER_40]: I mean, come on, see the light and act upon it.

1086
01:42:20,626 --> 01:42:20,946
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

1087
01:42:23,527 --> 01:42:24,427
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

1088
01:42:25,748 --> 01:42:30,111
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there anyone who hasn't had a chance to speak yet who would like to speak either in person or on Zoom?

1089
01:42:31,131 --> 01:42:33,613
[SPEAKER_28]: I see Mr. Castagnetti.

1090
01:42:33,673 --> 01:42:35,013
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

1091
01:42:35,033 --> 01:42:39,516
[SPEAKER_28]: You'll have three minutes, and then we'll go back to... One second, Andy.

1092
01:42:39,536 --> 01:42:40,536
[SPEAKER_28]: I gotta turn on your microphone.

1093
01:42:41,077 --> 01:42:41,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, sir.

1094
01:42:42,377 --> 01:42:42,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.

1095
01:42:44,058 --> 01:42:44,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, sir.

1096
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:50,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Being of Castagnetti, Andrew, Ace, Medford.

1097
01:42:51,877 --> 01:42:57,240
[SPEAKER_10]: being of Ginju blood since 1492, yeah, and Columbus too, by the way.

1098
01:42:59,522 --> 01:43:03,744
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanna quote the Bible, Genesis chapter 12, verse three.

1099
01:43:03,944 --> 01:43:09,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether you believe in God and the Bible or not, I must quote these verses.

1100
01:43:12,869 --> 01:43:14,831
[SPEAKER_10]: I will bless thee who blesses thee.

1101
01:43:16,231 --> 01:43:18,753
[SPEAKER_10]: I will curse he, her, or it.

1102
01:43:19,687 --> 01:43:20,607
[SPEAKER_10]: who curses thee."

1103
01:43:21,027 --> 01:43:25,348
[SPEAKER_10]: The translation is, if you go against the Jews, you will perish.

1104
01:43:28,309 --> 01:43:32,789
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, I'm afraid history is repeating itself.

1105
01:43:35,450 --> 01:43:47,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Bloomberg, Sr., believed in the 40s, bought a house in West Medford, but he was not allowed, as a Jew,

1106
01:43:48,698 --> 01:43:50,338
[SPEAKER_10]: and how to use a strong name.

1107
01:43:52,339 --> 01:43:53,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we repeating history?

1108
01:43:54,279 --> 01:43:55,279
[SPEAKER_10]: This is insanity.

1109
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:56,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Be nice.

1110
01:43:58,180 --> 01:43:59,220
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

1111
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:04,061
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to go to Eileen Lerner on Zoom.

1112
01:44:04,081 --> 01:44:05,922
[SPEAKER_28]: Eileen, name and address for the record.

1113
01:44:05,962 --> 01:44:06,862
[SPEAKER_28]: You have three minutes.

1114
01:44:11,743 --> 01:44:16,184
[SPEAKER_18]: I am a Jew.

1115
01:44:20,047 --> 01:44:21,230
[SPEAKER_18]: I love my people.

1116
01:44:22,553 --> 01:44:23,856
[SPEAKER_18]: I love Judaism.

1117
01:44:23,876 --> 01:44:25,560
[SPEAKER_18]: I love the culture.

1118
01:44:27,490 --> 01:44:29,111
[SPEAKER_18]: but I am for this ordinance.

1119
01:44:29,792 --> 01:44:33,155
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel it reflects the Jewish values that I was taught.

1120
01:44:33,975 --> 01:44:35,337
[SPEAKER_18]: I want a peaceful world.

1121
01:44:36,277 --> 01:44:42,122
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want a world where children are being torn apart by bombs every day.

1122
01:44:42,242 --> 01:44:47,607
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want a world where people are starved to death and we have to stand by and watch it.

1123
01:44:47,847 --> 01:44:48,588
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.

1124
01:44:48,708 --> 01:44:55,133
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want a world where crazy people can get guns and come into schools and kill.

1125
01:44:56,034 --> 01:45:02,236
[SPEAKER_18]: kids and go into supermarkets and go to music performances and kill people.

1126
01:45:02,436 --> 01:45:03,937
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, we have a death culture.

1127
01:45:03,977 --> 01:45:08,838
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we keep going on the way we're going, we're just going to blow up the world inevitably.

1128
01:45:08,858 --> 01:45:14,420
[SPEAKER_18]: To me, this this is a reflection of the desire for peace in the world.

1129
01:45:15,472 --> 01:45:16,813
[SPEAKER_18]: for peace everywhere.

1130
01:45:16,833 --> 01:45:22,375
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, look what's happening in the Sudan and in Congo and in other places around the world.

1131
01:45:22,435 --> 01:45:30,159
[SPEAKER_18]: And we have our hand in it because it's our tax money that's paying for a lot of these weapons.

1132
01:45:31,019 --> 01:45:32,680
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just want to congratulate

1133
01:45:35,128 --> 01:45:41,534
[SPEAKER_18]: Jason, who brought this forth, and Zach, and the city council for even considering it.

1134
01:45:42,214 --> 01:45:45,177
[SPEAKER_18]: And it definitely is not anti-Semitic.

1135
01:45:45,838 --> 01:45:47,179
[SPEAKER_18]: It's anti-war.

1136
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:50,322
[SPEAKER_18]: It's anti-killing people.

1137
01:45:50,502 --> 01:45:52,243
[SPEAKER_18]: It's anti-starvation.

1138
01:45:53,444 --> 01:45:54,665
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what it's about.

1139
01:45:56,287 --> 01:45:56,767
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1140
01:45:58,689 --> 01:45:59,590
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

1141
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:06,302
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there anyone who has not spoken yet in the chamber who would like to speak?

1142
01:46:08,603 --> 01:46:12,884
[SPEAKER_28]: Seeing none, I'm going to go to Josh Eckart Lee on Zoom.

1143
01:46:12,945 --> 01:46:16,386
[SPEAKER_28]: Josh, name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

1144
01:46:17,940 --> 01:46:19,861
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, President Bears.

1145
01:46:20,241 --> 01:46:24,243
[SPEAKER_26]: I urge you all to vote favorably on this.

1146
01:46:24,824 --> 01:46:30,527
[SPEAKER_26]: As I said at the last hearing, I drastically live on Main Street.

1147
01:46:31,207 --> 01:46:34,489
[SPEAKER_26]: I also serve on the city's Energy Environment Committee.

1148
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:44,435
[SPEAKER_26]: The committee sent a letter to this body strongly urging you to be in favor of fossil fuel divestment.

1149
01:46:45,175 --> 01:46:52,361
[SPEAKER_26]: And I also as a resident urge you to be in favor of this ordinance that does divest us from the fossil fuel industry.

1150
01:46:52,941 --> 01:47:04,490
[SPEAKER_26]: As the previous speaker said, the fossil fuel industry and these investments in destructive industries are not in line with our values, and we really commend the City Council for

1151
01:47:05,611 --> 01:47:14,522
[SPEAKER_26]: Bringing what power they can to the finances that we have in destructive industries, like some of our portfolio in Chevron.

1152
01:47:14,582 --> 01:47:21,851
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm really grateful that this is being considered and want to recognize the interrelations between

1153
01:47:22,512 --> 01:47:31,242
[SPEAKER_26]: the climate crisis that we face and the way that it exacerbates conflict around the world, that it drives people into prisons and other detention centers.

1154
01:47:31,542 --> 01:47:37,749
[SPEAKER_26]: And of course, all of that gets multiplied as impunity for human rights violations goes.

1155
01:47:38,890 --> 01:47:39,450
[SPEAKER_26]: unpunished.

1156
01:47:39,570 --> 01:47:45,853
[SPEAKER_26]: And so we really commend City Council for recognizing the interrelation between these various social harms.

1157
01:47:45,973 --> 01:47:52,695
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm grateful to see you all acting and investing in our futures and investing in alignment with our values.

1158
01:47:52,935 --> 01:47:53,295
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1159
01:47:55,076 --> 01:47:56,016
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comments.

1160
01:47:56,036 --> 01:48:01,298
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to stay on Zoom unless there's anyone who hasn't spoken yet who'd like to speak in person.

1161
01:48:03,037 --> 01:48:06,080
[SPEAKER_28]: Seeing none, I'm going to go to Dina on Zoom.

1162
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:07,901
[SPEAKER_28]: Dina, name and address for the record, please.

1163
01:48:07,941 --> 01:48:08,762
[SPEAKER_28]: You'll have three minutes.

1164
01:48:10,864 --> 01:48:14,867
[SPEAKER_45]: Hi, I'm Dina at 3780 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford.

1165
01:48:16,467 --> 01:48:24,813
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you, President Bears and for the city councilor for giving us this opportunity to speak on this and bringing this ordinance forward.

1166
01:48:25,093 --> 01:48:26,834
[SPEAKER_45]: I encourage you all to support this.

1167
01:48:27,935 --> 01:48:31,397
[SPEAKER_45]: I've spoken multiple times, but for me, this is very personal.

1168
01:48:33,159 --> 01:48:40,744
[SPEAKER_45]: We've heard from many other people in terms of divesting from fossil fuels and prisons and weapons manufacturers.

1169
01:48:40,784 --> 01:48:43,786
[SPEAKER_45]: But for me personally, as a Palestinian who has family in Gaza,

1170
01:48:45,427 --> 01:48:53,293
[SPEAKER_45]: it's really important that we invest our city money in not killing my family members.

1171
01:48:55,455 --> 01:49:02,180
[SPEAKER_45]: And it shouldn't be controversial to say that we don't want our tax dollars to harm human life.

1172
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:10,426
[SPEAKER_45]: So I just, again, I encourage you all to think about how this impacts human life.

1173
01:49:12,107 --> 01:49:12,728
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you so much.

1174
01:49:14,672 --> 01:49:15,652
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

1175
01:49:18,614 --> 01:49:22,815
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there anyone in person who'd like to speak for a second time for a minute?

1176
01:49:23,415 --> 01:49:25,716
[SPEAKER_28]: And I see two hands of people who've already spoken as well.

1177
01:49:26,217 --> 01:49:27,277
[SPEAKER_28]: So we'll go to the podium.

1178
01:49:27,497 --> 01:49:28,457
[SPEAKER_28]: You'll have one more minute.

1179
01:49:29,138 --> 01:49:30,418
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

1180
01:49:30,758 --> 01:49:33,780
[SPEAKER_20]: Sharon Diesso, corner of Mass Ave and Circuit Road.

1181
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:35,500
[SPEAKER_20]: Long time resident.

1182
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:36,441
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1183
01:49:36,481 --> 01:49:37,341
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll make this brief.

1184
01:49:38,621 --> 01:49:42,363
[SPEAKER_20]: Does anyone here want to present a strong definition of BDS?

1185
01:49:44,081 --> 01:49:46,482
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't know about this until early this morning.

1186
01:49:46,923 --> 01:50:01,050
[SPEAKER_20]: Somebody who's my long, long time friend and learned about Catholicism in Catholic food, in Italian food at my house, made sure from Israel that she had someone get in touch with me to let me know this was going on tonight.

1187
01:50:01,591 --> 01:50:06,814
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's kind of sad that Medford is an international known for things like this.

1188
01:50:09,295 --> 01:50:12,377
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, boycott, divestment, and sanctions.

1189
01:50:12,878 --> 01:50:20,003
[SPEAKER_20]: And this message, too, is for those who said earlier this evening that you're implying that Israel is part of this.

1190
01:50:20,504 --> 01:50:22,065
[SPEAKER_20]: This is how they define themselves.

1191
01:50:22,585 --> 01:50:35,095
[SPEAKER_20]: Boycott, divestment, and sanctions, BDS, is a Palestinian-led movement promoting boycotts, divestments, and economic sanctions against Israel.

1192
01:50:35,735 --> 01:50:37,877
[SPEAKER_20]: Its objective is to pressure Israel to

1193
01:50:39,238 --> 01:50:46,866
[SPEAKER_20]: excuse me, meet what the BDS movement describes as Israel's obligations under international law.

1194
01:50:48,655 --> 01:50:52,897
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a lot of paradoxes that are created in this definition.

1195
01:50:52,917 --> 01:50:54,979
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't have to begin to tell you what they are.

1196
01:50:55,559 --> 01:50:59,301
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm going to go to the end because I don't have time for the middle because I have a minute.

1197
01:51:00,101 --> 01:51:15,230
[SPEAKER_20]: From what I understand during the last few weeks, especially with the distinguished Netanyahu meeting at the White House, I don't care what you think of the White House administration, there has been a stability now brought for at least a decade because of what we had to do.

1198
01:51:16,150 --> 01:51:26,018
[SPEAKER_20]: So I do not see in these peace talks that this coalition has anything to do with anything that you could move forward and spend our money on.

1199
01:51:26,558 --> 01:51:31,602
[SPEAKER_20]: This is an international issue at the present time, and you're rekindling the fire again.

1200
01:51:32,183 --> 01:51:34,644
[SPEAKER_20]: Let the real experts work on the peace.

1201
01:51:34,905 --> 01:51:35,305
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1202
01:51:35,365 --> 01:51:35,705
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1203
01:51:35,825 --> 01:51:36,766
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

1204
01:51:38,768 --> 01:51:41,670
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to go back to Zoom, then I'll come back to the podium.

1205
01:51:41,730 --> 01:51:44,092
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to go to Micah on Zoom.

1206
01:51:44,292 --> 01:51:45,333
[SPEAKER_28]: Micah, you'll have one minute.

1207
01:51:47,508 --> 01:51:49,349
[SPEAKER_28]: One second, I just have to reset the timer.

1208
01:51:55,791 --> 01:51:58,032
[SPEAKER_28]: Requesting you to unmute, name and address for the record.

1209
01:51:58,052 --> 01:51:58,813
[SPEAKER_28]: You'll have one minute.

1210
01:51:59,293 --> 01:51:59,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, yeah.

1211
01:51:59,793 --> 01:52:01,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Micah Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

1212
01:52:01,394 --> 01:52:04,215
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a minute, so.

1213
01:52:04,655 --> 01:52:16,360
[SPEAKER_09]: But look, I will say that for those of you who have understandable financial concerns, do understand that similar ordinances in other cities in Michigan and elsewhere in the country

1214
01:52:17,170 --> 01:52:25,442
[SPEAKER_09]: have gone into effect and their portfolios have just done fine, if not outperformed their non curated counterparts.

1215
01:52:25,963 --> 01:52:31,090
[SPEAKER_09]: So financially, this isn't that big of a deal for the city's municipal funds.

1216
01:52:31,831 --> 01:52:32,793
[SPEAKER_09]: So don't like so.

1217
01:52:34,307 --> 01:52:35,407
[SPEAKER_09]: You look at the data, it just isn't.

1218
01:52:36,267 --> 01:52:38,028
[SPEAKER_09]: But the concern is understood.

1219
01:52:39,248 --> 01:52:45,369
[SPEAKER_09]: For those of you who are concerned about this dividing the community, again, this is coming from a substantial portion of the community.

1220
01:52:46,029 --> 01:53:02,793
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you guys who are definitely not just hungry, hopeful politicians are concerned about dividing the community, then perhaps you should be looking at trying to bridge that gap that you perceive in the community and talking to maybe that portion of the community that you, I guess, don't talk to for some reason.

1221
01:53:02,813 --> 01:53:03,573
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why that is.

1222
01:53:04,714 --> 01:53:05,595
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, weird.

1223
01:53:07,899 --> 01:53:15,290
[SPEAKER_09]: But for everyone else, like, you know, what pains me right now is that, you know, my grandparents used to say,

1224
01:53:20,183 --> 01:53:31,594
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so much fear right now about this being anti-Semitic and this being somehow against Jews and attacking the interests of Jews, even though it nowhere refers to Jews or Judaism.

1225
01:53:32,135 --> 01:53:35,258
[SPEAKER_09]: At most, it is targeted towards Israel at most.

1226
01:53:39,001 --> 01:53:44,945
[SPEAKER_09]: you are feeding into this narrative that to be Jewish is to be loyal to Israel first and foremost.

1227
01:53:45,625 --> 01:54:03,117
[SPEAKER_09]: And I cannot say how, I cannot understate how incredibly dangerous it is to facilitate, enable, and actually espouse a narrative that Jews are Israeli and Jews are to Israel before they are to the U.S.

1228
01:54:03,157 --> 01:54:04,418
[SPEAKER_09]: or to their local communities.

1229
01:54:04,958 --> 01:54:06,559
[SPEAKER_09]: That's crazy and dangerous.

1230
01:54:07,020 --> 01:54:09,301
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to think about that.

1231
01:54:09,341 --> 01:54:16,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Religious leaders, I urge you to maybe try and talk to the different parts of the Jewish community and have a conversation to address that fear.

1232
01:54:16,585 --> 01:54:18,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Because right now, you're just fostering it.

1233
01:54:18,907 --> 01:54:26,712
[SPEAKER_09]: You're mongering in that fear rather than actually trying to alleviate it, which as a leader is important to do for the Jewish community.

1234
01:54:26,952 --> 01:54:27,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Micah, thank you.

1235
01:54:28,113 --> 01:54:28,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1236
01:54:33,050 --> 01:54:35,771
[SPEAKER_28]: going to go back to the podium and name and address for the record.

1237
01:54:35,951 --> 01:54:36,772
[SPEAKER_28]: You'll have one minute.

1238
01:54:37,132 --> 01:54:39,233
[SPEAKER_03]: William Ellison, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1239
01:54:40,093 --> 01:54:41,254
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a great opportunity.

1240
01:54:41,774 --> 01:54:49,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring people together, bring people together in small groups, bring people together to talk to each other and talk with each other and understand the history of the Middle East.

1241
01:54:50,418 --> 01:54:55,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Understand the tensions, understand all the peace treaties that were broken and not gone forward.

1242
01:54:55,641 --> 01:54:59,843
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can basically have a really good understanding of how to go forward.

1243
01:55:00,383 --> 01:55:02,304
[SPEAKER_03]: A performative ordinance

1244
01:55:02,787 --> 01:55:09,910
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going to get knocked down by legal issues, financial issues, and other things like that, doesn't really bring people together.

1245
01:55:10,550 --> 01:55:12,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to find ways so people can sit together and talk.

1246
01:55:13,471 --> 01:55:20,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you that last year or the year before, we had a book club at the temple, and we invited the imam from the cultural center.

1247
01:55:20,974 --> 01:55:23,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Great discussion, great discussion.

1248
01:55:24,035 --> 01:55:26,456
[SPEAKER_03]: We're as concerned about Muslims as we are about Jews.

1249
01:55:27,237 --> 01:55:30,198
[SPEAKER_03]: We understand that any number of people can be discriminated against.

1250
01:55:31,011 --> 01:55:47,163
[SPEAKER_03]: the way to bring things together, the way to build community, is not to put something out there that fragments, but to put in place processes that enable us to talk with each other, share viewpoints, and come to new understandings that allow us to move forward as a community.

1251
01:55:47,183 --> 01:55:51,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate your understanding, and I hope that you'll take that advice.

1252
01:55:51,066 --> 01:55:51,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1253
01:55:51,687 --> 01:55:52,167
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1254
01:55:56,770 --> 01:55:59,793
[SPEAKER_28]: You haven't spoken yet, so you will have three minutes.

1255
01:56:01,633 --> 01:56:02,697
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

1256
01:56:03,219 --> 01:56:04,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Patrick Clerkin, 50 Princeton Street.

1257
01:56:05,870 --> 01:56:18,716
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to address two particular sub-issues on this, and the first is related to the wholesale divestment from particularly the fossil fuel industries.

1258
01:56:19,997 --> 01:56:24,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that people don't realize the ripple effects of the fossil fuel divestment.

1259
01:56:24,199 --> 01:56:27,821
[SPEAKER_04]: There are other industries, the chemical industry, the plastics industry.

1260
01:56:28,361 --> 01:56:32,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I have critiques of all of these industries, and I think that there's

1261
01:56:33,343 --> 01:56:37,025
[SPEAKER_04]: substantial negatives to them, but there's also substantial positives to them.

1262
01:56:37,405 --> 01:56:53,392
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of what we have that we take for granted are clothes, eyeglasses, equipment around us, medical equipment, vehicle equipment that reduce vehicle weight and that reduce vehicle emissions.

1263
01:56:53,452 --> 01:56:58,555
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of good things come from the fossil fuel industry and its byproducts.

1264
01:56:59,455 --> 01:57:02,518
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm concerned with the wholesale divestment, first of all.

1265
01:57:02,958 --> 01:57:09,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second thing is, I think there are other industries that equally have downsides to them.

1266
01:57:10,546 --> 01:57:17,152
[SPEAKER_04]: So looking at defense, we're focusing on how the defense industries have more of an emphasis on

1267
01:57:17,552 --> 01:57:19,413
[SPEAKER_04]: war rather than defense and peace.

1268
01:57:19,633 --> 01:57:20,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that criticism.

1269
01:57:21,814 --> 01:57:30,617
[SPEAKER_04]: You could add to the list media, which tends to emphasize getting people profiting off of getting people to hate each other.

1270
01:57:31,057 --> 01:57:38,800
[SPEAKER_04]: You could focus on the pharmaceutical industry, which often focuses more on sickness rather than on health.

1271
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:55,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's easier to focus on defense industries and fossil fuel industries when they're located geographically in say Texas or the or the south of the United States and not focus on the pharmaceutical industry which is in our own backyard which has

1272
01:57:55,684 --> 01:58:00,827
[SPEAKER_04]: jobs and money flowing through the veins of Massachusetts more so than these things that we're trying to divest.

1273
01:58:01,448 --> 01:58:10,273
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's very specific and odd to focus on just several of these things and wholesale divest from them.

1274
01:58:10,693 --> 01:58:18,558
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think if you look at the broad systems level perspective, there's tradeoffs everywhere, and I think it should be looked at more piecemeal.

1275
01:58:18,958 --> 01:58:19,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1276
01:58:20,820 --> 01:58:21,100
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1277
01:58:22,866 --> 01:58:28,304
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there anyone in the chamber who would like to speak on public participation who hasn't spoken yet?

1278
01:58:34,857 --> 01:58:37,499
[SPEAKER_43]: Hi, Angela Murphy, 16 Carding Street.

1279
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:40,781
[SPEAKER_43]: And I didn't come here to speak on this issue.

1280
01:58:41,862 --> 01:58:47,066
[SPEAKER_43]: And I can't speak on zoning, but I will relay that comment another time.

1281
01:58:47,986 --> 01:58:57,453
[SPEAKER_43]: I just want to put in a comment that what I'm hearing that this concerns and this fear is actually real for this community.

1282
01:58:58,433 --> 01:58:58,974
[SPEAKER_43]: I don't think

1283
01:58:59,934 --> 01:59:07,357
[SPEAKER_43]: that you can deny that what they're telling you is something that they've lived through their ancestors in the past.

1284
01:59:07,997 --> 01:59:18,921
[SPEAKER_43]: If this is gonna make them not feel comfortable and method, we could lose a whole community of residents who are beneficial to our diversity.

1285
01:59:19,801 --> 01:59:24,664
[SPEAKER_43]: and I'm afraid for them, and I'm sorry this is happening, and they have to go through this again.

1286
01:59:25,204 --> 01:59:28,085
[SPEAKER_43]: They want to deny what history has happened to certain people.

1287
01:59:28,746 --> 01:59:38,851
[SPEAKER_43]: They're trying to erase it, but they can't erase it because it's too prominent in a lot of people's minds and told over centuries and through families.

1288
01:59:39,611 --> 01:59:40,372
[SPEAKER_43]: Listen to them.

1289
01:59:40,932 --> 01:59:42,313
[SPEAKER_43]: Rethink certain parts.

1290
01:59:42,873 --> 01:59:43,974
[SPEAKER_43]: Talk about it again.

1291
01:59:44,414 --> 01:59:47,075
[SPEAKER_43]: Go over it and hear their true concerns.

1292
01:59:48,556 --> 01:59:49,237
[SPEAKER_43]: I feel for them.

1293
01:59:49,297 --> 01:59:49,958
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm Catholic.

1294
01:59:50,838 --> 01:59:56,864
[SPEAKER_43]: I was told if a Catholic person goes into a temple, they're going to go to hell.

1295
01:59:57,805 --> 01:59:59,507
[SPEAKER_43]: My kids went to a Jewish temple.

1296
02:00:00,408 --> 02:00:05,172
[SPEAKER_43]: I did not hold anything against any culture, any religion, anything.

1297
02:00:06,173 --> 02:00:26,331
[SPEAKER_43]: And I feel for these people I didn't come up here to talk about this but I wanted to say that I'm sorry that they were going through in this, that you have this right here, and that I hope everybody listens to them, read things whatever is going on because I have no idea but I just hearing a concern for them, and as a fellow resident I've been here 69 years.

1298
02:00:28,706 --> 02:00:34,110
[SPEAKER_43]: I want them to stay in the community and feel safe and walk around and not be concerned.

1299
02:00:34,170 --> 02:00:38,814
[SPEAKER_43]: And maybe their concerns are valid to some degree, and I'm sure they are.

1300
02:00:39,294 --> 02:00:39,955
[SPEAKER_43]: Listen to them.

1301
02:00:40,075 --> 02:00:40,455
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

1302
02:00:41,116 --> 02:00:41,916
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

1303
02:00:41,936 --> 02:00:49,302
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there anyone else who has not spoken yet who would like to speak?

1304
02:00:53,013 --> 02:00:55,214
[SPEAKER_28]: Seeing none, I'm going to go back to Zoom to Maria.

1305
02:00:55,274 --> 02:00:56,714
[SPEAKER_28]: Maria, you'll have one minute.

1306
02:00:57,054 --> 02:00:58,594
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to request you unmute.

1307
02:00:59,314 --> 02:01:01,055
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

1308
02:01:14,058 --> 02:01:15,018
[SPEAKER_28]: Maria, are you there?

1309
02:01:16,218 --> 02:01:17,019
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, hello.

1310
02:01:17,539 --> 02:01:22,500
[SPEAKER_42]: I just wanted to say that a couple of people have asked you, President Bears,

1311
02:01:23,347 --> 02:01:29,729
[SPEAKER_42]: what you're gonna do and would you delete that paragraph and would you withdraw this?

1312
02:01:30,369 --> 02:01:34,991
[SPEAKER_42]: And you haven't responded, which is disappointing.

1313
02:01:36,051 --> 02:01:37,672
[SPEAKER_28]: After everyone's had a chance to speak.

1314
02:01:40,253 --> 02:01:41,353
[SPEAKER_42]: That's all, thank you.

1315
02:01:42,173 --> 02:01:42,633
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1316
02:01:48,355 --> 02:01:49,716
[SPEAKER_28]: Going to go to Munir Germanis.

1317
02:01:51,010 --> 02:01:54,867
[SPEAKER_28]: For one minute, Muneer, name and address for the record, and I'm asking you to unmute.

1318
02:02:00,642 --> 02:02:04,524
[SPEAKER_40]: Hi, Munir Jamanis, 3 Summit Road in Medford.

1319
02:02:06,524 --> 02:02:18,729
[SPEAKER_40]: Again, I guess I'm a little surprised that somebody is bringing up superfluous issues that have nothing to do with this proposed ordinance.

1320
02:02:20,049 --> 02:02:21,790
[SPEAKER_40]: An example is BDS.

1321
02:02:23,030 --> 02:02:26,211
[SPEAKER_40]: What they failed to say is that BDS

1322
02:02:29,020 --> 02:02:55,861
[SPEAKER_40]: is a non-violent, peaceful approach to simply ask the government of Israel to stop the occupation, to end the apartheid system in which citizens in Israel that are of Palestinian origin don't have the same rights as citizens who are Jewish in Israel.

1323
02:02:57,884 --> 02:03:04,586
[SPEAKER_40]: simply to end the occupation, then the BDS will go away, just like we did in South Africa.

1324
02:03:05,746 --> 02:03:06,086
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1325
02:03:07,467 --> 02:03:08,407
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

1326
02:03:08,427 --> 02:03:15,389
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to go to Eileen Lerner.

1327
02:03:15,649 --> 02:03:17,070
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

1328
02:03:17,090 --> 02:03:17,770
[SPEAKER_28]: You have one minute.

1329
02:03:20,453 --> 02:03:21,794
[SPEAKER_18]: My name is Eileen Lerner.

1330
02:03:21,834 --> 02:03:24,735
[SPEAKER_18]: I live at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1331
02:03:25,516 --> 02:03:31,879
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just want to say that the Jewish community is more than the Jews that go to the synagogue in Medford.

1332
02:03:32,439 --> 02:03:42,285
[SPEAKER_18]: There are many, many Jews in the Jewish community in Medford who support this resolution, whose values it expresses.

1333
02:03:43,105 --> 02:03:50,768
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think it's very narrow minded to only think that the people that go to synagogue are Jews.

1334
02:03:51,008 --> 02:03:53,429
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like, oh, are they the real Jews?

1335
02:03:53,709 --> 02:03:54,929
[SPEAKER_18]: What about the rest of us?

1336
02:03:55,649 --> 02:03:56,930
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we're Jews, too.

1337
02:03:57,090 --> 02:03:57,970
[SPEAKER_18]: What about us?

1338
02:03:58,090 --> 02:03:59,351
[SPEAKER_18]: What about what we think?

1339
02:03:59,431 --> 02:04:00,951
[SPEAKER_18]: What about what we value?

1340
02:04:01,671 --> 02:04:03,332
[SPEAKER_18]: Which goes back to the Bible.

1341
02:04:04,474 --> 02:04:16,922
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, if you read the Bible, I don't think, and even if you read the New Testament, I don't think you can have the values that we see operating in the world today.

1342
02:04:16,982 --> 02:04:18,503
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to change things.

1343
02:04:18,623 --> 02:04:25,767
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't keep going down the same path for the climate, for the children, for everybody.

1344
02:04:26,548 --> 02:04:28,429
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to do something positive.

1345
02:04:28,489 --> 02:04:31,971
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is a positive thing that is being proposed.

1346
02:04:32,932 --> 02:04:33,292
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1347
02:04:34,785 --> 02:04:35,885
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

1348
02:04:37,966 --> 02:04:45,650
[SPEAKER_28]: RM, I'm gonna need to ask you to either message me on the chat with your name or change your initials to a name on Zoom.

1349
02:04:46,210 --> 02:04:52,473
[SPEAKER_28]: We've had Zoom bombing incidents and I'm not gonna unmute anyone unless they share their name on Zoom.

1350
02:04:56,914 --> 02:04:57,915
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, thank you.

1351
02:04:58,355 --> 02:04:59,336
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for doing that.

1352
02:04:59,896 --> 02:05:02,377
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm gonna go to Patricia Brady-Doherty for one minute.

1353
02:05:03,408 --> 02:05:05,409
[SPEAKER_28]: Patricia, name and address for the record.

1354
02:05:05,489 --> 02:05:07,210
[SPEAKER_28]: You have one minute.

1355
02:05:09,272 --> 02:05:09,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1356
02:05:10,172 --> 02:05:13,154
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to address this through the chair to the prior speaker.

1357
02:05:14,915 --> 02:05:22,620
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to be Jewish to care and hear the sadness and how frightened these people are.

1358
02:05:23,020 --> 02:05:26,662
[SPEAKER_11]: This resolution cannot affect what happens in the Middle East.

1359
02:05:27,042 --> 02:05:29,764
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, it really doesn't even have a place on the council agenda.

1360
02:05:31,428 --> 02:05:33,729
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm Catholic, but tonight I'm Jewish.

1361
02:05:34,369 --> 02:05:35,569
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel for these people.

1362
02:05:35,910 --> 02:05:37,250
[SPEAKER_11]: This is such a disgrace.

1363
02:05:37,610 --> 02:05:37,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1364
02:05:40,131 --> 02:05:41,251
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

1365
02:05:53,496 --> 02:05:54,896
[SPEAKER_28]: Rich, I'm gonna come to you.

1366
02:05:54,916 --> 02:05:56,677
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record.

1367
02:05:56,697 --> 02:05:57,477
[SPEAKER_28]: You'll have three minutes.

1368
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:03,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Rich Maidman, 18 Sterling Street.

1369
02:06:04,561 --> 02:06:07,741
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm here speaking in solidarity with the Medford Jewish community.

1370
02:06:08,802 --> 02:06:15,203
[SPEAKER_15]: This thinly veiled targeting of the single Jewish state is despicable and offensive to members of the Jewish community.

1371
02:06:15,903 --> 02:06:23,325
[SPEAKER_15]: And I urge the council to reject it and ignore all the anti-Semitic tropes that we just heard espoused in conjunction with it.

1372
02:06:24,057 --> 02:06:26,638
[SPEAKER_15]: We also just heard a little bit about BDS.

1373
02:06:26,838 --> 02:06:32,619
[SPEAKER_15]: What wasn't said is that the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist groups are instrumental in the BDS movement.

1374
02:06:33,359 --> 02:06:38,961
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, moving on, significant portions of the bill are patently illegal and administratively impossible.

1375
02:06:39,421 --> 02:06:41,902
[SPEAKER_15]: It's unbelievable that it has gotten to this point.

1376
02:06:42,942 --> 02:06:47,283
[SPEAKER_15]: It almost feels like certain members of the council are trying to induce lawsuits against the city.

1377
02:06:48,637 --> 02:06:53,899
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who vote for this bill also demonstrate their commitment to virtue signaling over the community they serve.

1378
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:56,561
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't even hold index funds under it.

1379
02:06:57,281 --> 02:07:06,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Whoever votes for this is responsible for any budget shortfalls that result in public parks not being kept up, school infrastructure crumbling, and public safety shortcomings.

1380
02:07:07,386 --> 02:07:12,148
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a good thing you are not working for a public entity because your breach of fiduciary duties is colossal.

1381
02:07:13,382 --> 02:07:22,004
[SPEAKER_15]: I call on all Councilors considering voting for this bill to disclose all of their investments personally to ensure that they are not saying one thing and doing another.

1382
02:07:23,264 --> 02:07:32,286
[SPEAKER_15]: And to many of those considering voting for this ordinance, remember that you were elected to serve your community, not adhere to the purity tests of national organizations.

1383
02:07:37,408 --> 02:07:38,308
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

1384
02:07:43,174 --> 02:07:45,295
[SPEAKER_28]: going to go to Anna on Zoom.

1385
02:07:45,435 --> 02:07:47,076
[SPEAKER_28]: Anna, name and address for the record, please.

1386
02:07:47,096 --> 02:07:47,937
[SPEAKER_28]: You have three minutes.

1387
02:07:50,718 --> 02:07:52,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, my name is Anna Meyer.

1388
02:07:52,299 --> 02:07:55,201
[SPEAKER_08]: I live at 6 Douglas Road, Medford, Massachusetts.

1389
02:07:56,101 --> 02:08:01,104
[SPEAKER_08]: And I am speaking tonight in support of the divestment ordinance.

1390
02:08:02,164 --> 02:08:06,307
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that this is an incredibly important moment for

1391
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:22,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford to take responsibility for the work that our money does out in the world, and to commit our money to doing the things that we know are aligned with Medford's values, including not investing in detention.

1392
02:08:24,572 --> 02:08:38,403
[SPEAKER_08]: of immigrant children and families that are being separated, divesting from fossil fuels, from weapons of mass destruction, as well as divesting from any companies that are profiting from

1393
02:08:40,173 --> 02:08:42,534
[SPEAKER_08]: any crimes against humanity.

1394
02:08:42,594 --> 02:08:56,317
[SPEAKER_08]: And while that certainly would include the crimes that are being committed every day against people in Gaza, the news headlines today just said that 59 children were shot while waiting in line for water.

1395
02:08:56,337 --> 02:09:02,958
[SPEAKER_08]: This is absolutely an ordinance that will go far and beyond that to really make sure that we are investing

1396
02:09:03,919 --> 02:09:05,540
[SPEAKER_08]: in line with Medford values.

1397
02:09:06,921 --> 02:09:32,018
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to iterate that this is a resolution that was brought forward by Medford residents, and we have been working on it carefully to make sure that it reflects our interests, as well as thoughtfulness in working with the specific definitions that are included in this ordinance to make sure that it is in line with international law that is working to make sure

1398
02:09:32,838 --> 02:09:43,444
[SPEAKER_08]: that our money is gonna be invested in ways that support the wellbeing of children and families and the environment everywhere and not investing in systems of harm.

1399
02:09:43,504 --> 02:09:49,027
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm grateful for your support of the resolution and hearing comments tonight.

1400
02:09:49,147 --> 02:09:49,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1401
02:09:51,629 --> 02:09:52,750
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

1402
02:09:52,770 --> 02:09:58,793
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there anyone either in person or on Zoom who has or has not spoken who would like to speak?

1403
02:10:01,609 --> 02:10:03,130
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, you have one minute.

1404
02:10:03,170 --> 02:10:04,871
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

1405
02:10:05,071 --> 02:10:06,952
[SPEAKER_30]: State Mayor 373 Riverside Ave.

1406
02:10:07,832 --> 02:10:12,235
[SPEAKER_30]: Drop this whole resolution and instead maybe focus on something that brings everyone together.

1407
02:10:12,915 --> 02:10:19,819
[SPEAKER_30]: I guarantee you could get for all the time and energy spent on this and all the negative energy, you could have had one heck of a blood drive.

1408
02:10:20,639 --> 02:10:22,220
[SPEAKER_30]: And that would benefit people in your city.

1409
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:24,802
[SPEAKER_30]: That would benefit people in your local area.

1410
02:10:25,982 --> 02:10:29,024
[SPEAKER_30]: Pretty sure the Red Cross would take people's blood and use it all over the world.

1411
02:10:30,928 --> 02:10:33,489
[SPEAKER_30]: Drop this, do something positive, maybe something like that.

1412
02:10:34,289 --> 02:10:35,830
[SPEAKER_30]: How many people here would donate blood?

1413
02:10:35,850 --> 02:10:43,332
[SPEAKER_30]: You know what, that's at least 10 pints more than you had.

1414
02:10:43,372 --> 02:10:47,113
[SPEAKER_30]: If you're gonna spend taxpayer dollars on something, do something positive for the world.

1415
02:10:47,353 --> 02:10:47,734
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1416
02:10:48,774 --> 02:10:49,894
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your comment.

1417
02:10:53,075 --> 02:10:55,036
[SPEAKER_28]: Seeing no further, would you like to speak, Andy?

1418
02:10:55,216 --> 02:10:55,456
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1419
02:10:57,357 --> 02:10:58,157
[SPEAKER_28]: You have one minute.

1420
02:11:00,263 --> 02:11:01,263
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take a few seconds.

1421
02:11:01,924 --> 02:11:03,344
[SPEAKER_10]: What was I gonna say?

1422
02:11:05,865 --> 02:11:15,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody's right if everybody is wrong, as the song says, but let's us not forget what happened October 7th, 2023.

1423
02:11:15,648 --> 02:11:18,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Innocent people in a concert.

1424
02:11:19,589 --> 02:11:21,970
[SPEAKER_10]: That's equivalent to three, two and a half.

1425
02:11:25,291 --> 02:11:28,952
[SPEAKER_10]: What happened in New York City, you know, the World Trade Center.

1426
02:11:30,058 --> 02:11:30,979
[SPEAKER_10]: That was horrendous.

1427
02:11:31,179 --> 02:11:37,507
[SPEAKER_10]: After thousands of years, wrong, two wrongs don't make a right, but that was horrendous.

1428
02:11:37,687 --> 02:11:39,449
[SPEAKER_10]: And I cannot watch that video.

1429
02:11:40,170 --> 02:11:41,492
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a stomach for it.

1430
02:11:42,813 --> 02:11:43,194
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1431
02:11:48,958 --> 02:11:49,458
[SPEAKER_28]: Thanks, everyone.

1432
02:11:49,478 --> 02:11:52,220
[SPEAKER_28]: I appreciate the comments that we heard tonight.

1433
02:11:52,580 --> 02:11:59,725
[SPEAKER_28]: I have had a number of conversations over the last couple of weeks with people who have questions and concerns about the ordinance.

1434
02:12:00,065 --> 02:12:08,011
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm still working to reach out to everybody who has emailed me or otherwise tried to contact me about it.

1435
02:12:08,651 --> 02:12:14,235
[SPEAKER_28]: The reason there are no edits in the version that was on the agenda tonight is that I did not have control over the process.

1436
02:12:14,815 --> 02:12:34,831
[SPEAKER_28]: This was tabled from last meeting, using a council procedural rule that required it to come up again at this meeting, I am planning to propose amendments to the ordinance and I am planning to communicate with many of the people who have spoken tonight about the content of the ordinance, I don't think that we will all completely agree on everything

1437
02:12:35,571 --> 02:12:58,221
[SPEAKER_28]: that ever happens in this chamber, but I am working to have conversations to address the concerns that have been raised tonight, concerns that have been raised to me outside of this meeting, so that we can create a product that reflects what I think are shared values in this community, and also respects and listens to, I think, the very real fears that people have shared with me in person, in this meeting, and in other places.

1438
02:12:59,421 --> 02:13:03,124
[SPEAKER_28]: I would ask folks to look at what I said at our last meeting.

1439
02:13:03,144 --> 02:13:05,166
[SPEAKER_28]: I gave two what I think

1440
02:13:08,978 --> 02:13:16,282
[SPEAKER_28]: We're very honest and direct remarks about why I propose this ordinance and my feelings about the comments that were shared at the last meeting.

1441
02:13:16,962 --> 02:13:25,206
[SPEAKER_28]: And I do want to apologize to folks that we haven't had the chance to meet or talk yet or that the edits weren't made yet, but there will be changes.

1442
02:13:25,586 --> 02:13:32,630
[SPEAKER_28]: And we're going to work through this to create a product that, and an ordinance that addresses as many concerns as we can.

1443
02:13:33,210 --> 02:13:37,012
[SPEAKER_28]: So I just wanted to say that, but I wanted to give everyone a chance to speak before I did.

1444
02:13:38,238 --> 02:13:39,939
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to recognize Councilor Collins.

1445
02:13:45,604 --> 02:13:48,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Bears for allowing me the opportunity to speak.

1446
02:13:48,747 --> 02:13:51,489
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll keep this brief because the paper has been tabled.

1447
02:13:51,509 --> 02:13:53,931
[SPEAKER_13]: We have other items on the agenda still to get to.

1448
02:13:53,951 --> 02:14:04,860
[SPEAKER_13]: I shared a lot three weeks ago about my reasons for supporting this ordinance, and I will not repeat all of that tonight, especially because this will be coming up before the council again.

1449
02:14:05,947 --> 02:14:11,251
[SPEAKER_13]: for both councillors and members of the public to comment on in a future meeting.

1450
02:14:12,752 --> 02:14:27,543
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to share before I make a motion to revert back to our regular order of business, that as Medford's first and only Jewish city councillor, I hope that our future conversations on this ordinance

1451
02:14:28,493 --> 02:14:31,216
[SPEAKER_13]: contain less anti-Semitic language than what I heard tonight.

1452
02:14:31,296 --> 02:14:43,067
[SPEAKER_13]: And by that, I mean, I will say every time it happens, how offensive I find it as a Jew, when anybody purports to speak for the Jewish community as a monolith.

1453
02:14:44,448 --> 02:14:48,132
[SPEAKER_13]: We do not all support this ordinance or ordinances like it.

1454
02:14:48,172 --> 02:14:49,373
[SPEAKER_13]: We do not all condemn it.

1455
02:14:50,074 --> 02:14:51,755
[SPEAKER_13]: We do not all feel scared by it.

1456
02:14:52,316 --> 02:14:53,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of us do, apparently.

1457
02:14:54,780 --> 02:14:59,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Not all Jews feel an inherent link between the nation-state of Israel and the Jewish people.

1458
02:14:59,963 --> 02:15:10,008
[SPEAKER_13]: The Jewish community is an incredibly religiously, culturally, ethnically, ideologically, and politically plural community.

1459
02:15:11,369 --> 02:15:23,436
[SPEAKER_13]: To say that the Jewish community is a monolith, to purport to speak for the entire Jewish community, and I'm speaking to people who do not identify as Jews, as well as people who are, on this ordinance, on anything else, I find is anti-Semitic.

1460
02:15:24,431 --> 02:15:31,075
[SPEAKER_13]: And I sincerely hope that when we continue our productive conversations about this ordinance in future meetings, people can speak for themselves.

1461
02:15:31,855 --> 02:15:33,876
[SPEAKER_13]: They can speak for people that they have personally talked to.

1462
02:15:33,916 --> 02:15:35,417
[SPEAKER_13]: They can speak for groups that they represent.

1463
02:15:36,378 --> 02:15:46,784
[SPEAKER_13]: And I fervently wish that people will not be so offensive to the Jewish community to report that we are a flat monolith with one opinion on any issue.

1464
02:15:47,604 --> 02:15:48,745
[SPEAKER_13]: It is extremely offensive.

1465
02:15:50,346 --> 02:15:50,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the time.

1466
02:15:53,804 --> 02:16:03,109
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you on the motion of the vice president to revert to the regular order of business seconded by seconded by Councilor Leming, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1467
02:16:07,931 --> 02:16:08,512
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Callahan?

1468
02:16:10,072 --> 02:16:10,853
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Collins?

1469
02:16:11,373 --> 02:16:11,593
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

1470
02:16:12,994 --> 02:16:13,834
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1471
02:16:14,415 --> 02:16:14,715
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

1472
02:16:15,935 --> 02:16:16,376
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Leming?

1473
02:16:16,396 --> 02:16:16,456
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

1474
02:16:17,156 --> 02:16:17,776
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1475
02:16:17,796 --> 02:16:17,876
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

1476
02:16:19,317 --> 02:16:19,837
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Tseng?

1477
02:16:20,658 --> 02:16:20,818
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1478
02:16:22,782 --> 02:16:38,338
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, 70 affirmative, none of the negative the motion passes and we revert to the regular order of business to 5113 offered by Councilor Scarpelli resolve the city council get an update from the health department for rodent issues in the Wellington Glenwood neighborhoods, Middlesex Avenue area Councilor Scarpelli.

1479
02:16:38,838 --> 02:16:39,759
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1480
02:16:39,879 --> 02:17:03,931
[SPEAKER_32]: I think we've exhausted so many avenues, and I know that our health department has worked on this, but I think we need to hold a community meeting because it wasn't just the neighborhood from Walter Glenwood reached out because they feel like they haven't been supported, but as that happened, I received phone calls from every other corner of the city of Medford, and I think that we owe it to our residents that we hold a community meeting

1481
02:17:05,352 --> 02:17:13,379
[SPEAKER_32]: to really share the concerns and issues that is now turned in to a pretty substantial crisis in the city.

1482
02:17:13,779 --> 02:17:15,261
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's the rat infestation.

1483
02:17:15,321 --> 02:17:29,674
[SPEAKER_32]: So I would appreciate the council to allow me to make the motion that we call for a community meeting with the health department and the pest company and the city administration to really get a hold of these concerns and issues.

1484
02:17:29,714 --> 02:17:29,994
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

1485
02:17:31,421 --> 02:17:39,469
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Scarpelli, is that a motion to refer this paper to Committee of the Whole and invite the Health Department and Pest Control and the administration?

1486
02:17:40,910 --> 02:17:42,772
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Clerk, when you have the motion, please let me know.

1487
02:17:46,295 --> 02:17:51,340
[SPEAKER_28]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to refer the paper to the Committee of the Whole, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1488
02:17:51,481 --> 02:17:52,682
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1489
02:17:56,172 --> 02:17:57,393
[SPEAKER_22]: President Bears, I have a question.

1490
02:17:57,473 --> 02:17:58,193
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, sorry.

1491
02:17:58,313 --> 02:17:59,835
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Lazzaro, before we call the roll.

1492
02:17:59,895 --> 02:18:00,635
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1493
02:18:02,917 --> 02:18:12,263
[SPEAKER_22]: Through the chair, I was wondering if Councilor Scarpelli has spoken to the health department or to what degree has there been conversations?

1494
02:18:14,384 --> 02:18:18,127
[SPEAKER_28]: The councilor just has a question through the chair to Councilor Scarpelli about your conversations with the health department.

1495
02:18:27,551 --> 02:18:29,872
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry, I got to turn on your microphone.

1496
02:18:29,892 --> 02:18:30,192
[SPEAKER_28]: Go ahead.

1497
02:18:30,212 --> 02:18:30,412
[SPEAKER_32]: Sorry.

1498
02:18:31,032 --> 02:18:34,093
[SPEAKER_32]: I know that Councils brought up the same issues over and over again.

1499
02:18:34,533 --> 02:18:43,095
[SPEAKER_32]: So I haven't done this recently since this, the messages I've received the residents, but I would call for a meeting with all parties involved.

1500
02:18:43,175 --> 02:18:47,116
[SPEAKER_32]: I think we have to now try to move to the next level if we can, Council President.

1501
02:18:49,277 --> 02:18:52,998
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

1502
02:18:53,118 --> 02:18:53,858
[SPEAKER_22]: That's fine.

1503
02:18:54,038 --> 02:18:54,518
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, thank you.

1504
02:18:56,082 --> 02:18:56,562
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1505
02:18:56,582 --> 02:18:59,885
[SPEAKER_28]: On the motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1506
02:19:02,267 --> 02:19:03,148
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Collins.

1507
02:19:04,729 --> 02:19:04,929
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

1508
02:19:06,631 --> 02:19:06,811
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

1509
02:19:06,831 --> 02:19:06,891
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

1510
02:19:06,911 --> 02:19:07,151
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

1511
02:19:07,211 --> 02:19:07,451
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

1512
02:19:08,933 --> 02:19:10,894
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, I'm the affirmative.

1513
02:19:12,075 --> 02:19:13,917
[SPEAKER_37]: None of the negative emotion passes.

1514
02:19:21,597 --> 02:19:39,510
[SPEAKER_28]: Paper 25114 offered by Councilor Callahan and President Bears whereas as part of its 2024 2025 governing agenda and previous resolutions the council has stated its intention to implement the good landlord tax credit in order to help keep rents affordable and support landlords who offer below market rental rates and

1515
02:19:40,110 --> 02:19:52,159
[SPEAKER_28]: whereas the state law enabling the good landlord tax credit s 1795 specifically limits the quote qualified residential rental property to any unsubsidized two to four unit residential rental property

1516
02:19:52,978 --> 02:20:10,180
[SPEAKER_28]: And whereas the reason the council has not yet adopted this provision of state law is because of an analysis by the assessing department that stated that the tax credit would not be limited to small two to four unit rental properties, and this would provide a significant unintended benefit to corporate owners of large properties and impact the city's property tax levy.

1517
02:20:10,780 --> 02:20:37,368
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we request that the city solicitor provide a written legal opinion on whether the local adoption of the Good Landlord Tax Credit could be limited to two to four unit properties and provide both the City Council and the Chief Assessor with said opinion and be it further resolved that we request that the Chief Assessor provide the City Council with the potential impact of a Medford Good Landlord Tax Credit on the city's property tax levy based on the opinion provided by the city solicitor.

1518
02:20:37,868 --> 02:20:38,668
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Callahan.

1519
02:20:40,923 --> 02:20:41,203
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1520
02:20:43,303 --> 02:20:46,764
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that I am in favor of the good landlord tax credit.

1521
02:20:47,524 --> 02:21:00,426
[SPEAKER_17]: I know there has been some investigation sort of behind the scenes about asking the assessor about whether it would in fact be limited to two to four unit properties.

1522
02:21:01,887 --> 02:21:09,068
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that it's just, it would be best for us to have this discussion in a committee where we can all hear the assessor's opinion.

1523
02:21:10,169 --> 02:21:10,689
[SPEAKER_17]: It would be great.

1524
02:21:10,910 --> 02:21:27,047
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a new solicitor or bigger to have the solicitor, you know, provide legal opinion because really it is a legal opinion on what this state law, whether the state law will actually do what it is written that it will do, or if it will not be upheld to that writing that passed in the past session.

1525
02:21:28,947 --> 02:21:42,531
[SPEAKER_17]: And I really want to get to the bottom of whether we can pass this here in Medford because I would like to, and I just want to understand and have the full council be able to understand if there are reasons why we're not able to get this thing passed.

1526
02:21:44,671 --> 02:21:45,812
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

1527
02:21:45,892 --> 02:21:46,572
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Leming.

1528
02:21:47,987 --> 02:21:48,387
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1529
02:21:48,567 --> 02:21:49,929
[SPEAKER_33]: I fully agree.

1530
02:21:50,049 --> 02:21:57,534
[SPEAKER_33]: I had conversations with the assessor about a year ago about potentially passing the new good landlord tax credit.

1531
02:21:57,574 --> 02:22:11,905
[SPEAKER_33]: And he basically said that it was a, well, he hinted that it wouldn't quite have the effect that we wanted because it would apply equally to landlords, like small local landlords who willingly kept their,

1532
02:22:12,926 --> 02:22:23,953
[SPEAKER_33]: kept their rents low, as well as larger properties that are usually owned by companies who are, in many cases, required to keep affordable housing rates.

1533
02:22:24,133 --> 02:22:27,335
[SPEAKER_33]: There's no sort of legal way to distinguish between the two under state law.

1534
02:22:27,736 --> 02:22:36,041
[SPEAKER_33]: But I think it would be worthwhile to have those discussions in public and have a bit more of a formal analysis.

1535
02:22:36,201 --> 02:22:39,203
[SPEAKER_33]: So I'd like to thank my colleagues for bringing this forward.

1536
02:22:41,970 --> 02:22:43,094
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Councilor Lameing.

1537
02:22:43,194 --> 02:22:43,857
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Tseng.

1538
02:22:45,028 --> 02:22:45,708
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1539
02:22:45,929 --> 02:22:52,833
[SPEAKER_27]: I just wanted to thank my fellow Councilors for introducing this resolution, for getting the ball started again.

1540
02:22:52,853 --> 02:22:55,155
[SPEAKER_27]: I wanted to refer my support for this.

1541
02:22:56,236 --> 02:23:02,920
[SPEAKER_27]: Policy in general, of course, we'll have to look at the details of whether this does exactly what we want it to do.

1542
02:23:03,801 --> 02:23:09,305
[SPEAKER_27]: And I know Councilor Leming just brought up a point that I'd like to delve deeper into in the committee meeting.

1543
02:23:10,305 --> 02:23:12,607
[SPEAKER_27]: But in general, I just wanted to voice my support.

1544
02:23:16,176 --> 02:23:17,057
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Councilor Saing.

1545
02:23:17,077 --> 02:23:19,718
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there any further discussion by members of the Council?

1546
02:23:22,460 --> 02:23:25,422
[SPEAKER_28]: Seeing none, is there any discussion by members of the public on this resolution?

1547
02:23:28,004 --> 02:23:36,669
[SPEAKER_28]: Seeing no one in the chambers and no hands on Zoom, on the motion of Councilor Callaghan, seconded by Councilor Leming.

1548
02:23:36,749 --> 02:23:37,990
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1549
02:23:42,153 --> 02:23:45,195
[SPEAKER_28]: This is to approve and send to the administration.

1550
02:23:46,143 --> 02:23:47,624
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a good letter of tax credit.

1551
02:23:48,305 --> 02:23:50,767
[SPEAKER_17]: Asking the city for their opinion and then the assessor for the motion.

1586
02:25:45,708 --> 02:25:58,516

1608

[SPEAKER_28]: The CPC recommendation letter is attached and incorporated.

1614
02:27:26,905 --> 02:27:27,806
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening, everybody.

1615
02:27:27,846 --> 02:27:29,187
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you so much for making the time.

1616
02:27:29,267 --> 02:27:31,248
[SPEAKER_24]: Happy to be the caboose on this evening tonight.

1617
02:27:31,749 --> 02:27:39,735
[SPEAKER_24]: We're here today to seek CPA appropriation for historic preservation of the Medford Armory that's right here in Medford Square.

1618
02:27:40,596 --> 02:27:45,660
[SPEAKER_24]: Unfortunately, members from the trust could not join me tonight, but I'm happy to answer any questions.

1619
02:27:45,700 --> 02:27:47,261
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a quick brief overview.

1620
02:27:47,841 --> 02:27:51,344
[SPEAKER_24]: They have done their due diligence as stewards of this historic building.

1621
02:27:51,464 --> 02:27:53,206
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a prominent building to Medford.

1622
02:27:53,266 --> 02:27:54,006
[SPEAKER_24]: It is our armory.

1623
02:27:55,367 --> 02:28:01,790
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, interestingly, I did a little bit more research into this and it was financed by Samuel Crocker Lawrence.

1624
02:28:02,450 --> 02:28:11,854
[SPEAKER_24]: So our very first mayor had his fingers very much into that building here, but it was used as military facility up until it was sold and I believe in the 70s.

1625
02:28:13,155 --> 02:28:21,221
[SPEAKER_24]: What they're looking to do right now is they've again done their due diligence conducted conditions assessment of the building once they started noticing some failures of the exterior.

1626
02:28:22,301 --> 02:28:26,704
[SPEAKER_24]: And have started putting together financial packages for what that looks like.

1627
02:28:26,744 --> 02:28:29,406
[SPEAKER_24]: They're looking down the barrel of an $800,000 project.

1628
02:28:30,007 --> 02:28:41,995
[SPEAKER_24]: But what we are here before you tonight is to ask for emergency funding to fix one particular corner of the facade that is experiencing some water inundation that is

1629
02:28:43,617 --> 02:28:47,138
[SPEAKER_24]: exacerbating the issues, the known issues with the building exterior.

1630
02:28:48,398 --> 02:28:59,341
[SPEAKER_24]: So they have come to us asking for a 50% match on that funding, and the Council has, our committee has recommended that funding.

1631
02:28:59,361 --> 02:29:03,022
[SPEAKER_24]: So again, happy to answer any questions.

1632
02:29:04,883 --> 02:29:06,343
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Manager Dupont.

1633
02:29:06,363 --> 02:29:11,665
[SPEAKER_28]: Do we have any questions from members of the Council?

1634
02:29:15,218 --> 02:29:16,199
[SPEAKER_28]: Seeing none, is there a motion?

1635
02:29:17,420 --> 02:29:23,364
[SPEAKER_28]: On the motion to approve by Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Callahan, I'm going to go to Mr. Castagnetti.

1636
02:29:23,464 --> 02:29:24,345
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record.

1637
02:29:24,365 --> 02:29:25,025
[SPEAKER_28]: You have three minutes.

1638
02:29:25,946 --> 02:29:28,928
[SPEAKER_10]: I just have one question.

1639
02:29:29,228 --> 02:29:32,891
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought the armory was under private ownership.

1640
02:29:33,391 --> 02:29:37,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we allowed to use our public money on a private building?

1641
02:29:41,604 --> 02:29:42,184
[SPEAKER_35]: I can address that.

1642
02:29:42,325 --> 02:29:42,605
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

1643
02:29:42,865 --> 02:29:44,006
[SPEAKER_24]: It is privately owned.

1644
02:29:44,306 --> 02:29:47,689
[SPEAKER_24]: However, this building is on the National Registry of Historic Places.

1645
02:29:47,709 --> 02:29:48,690
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry.

1646
02:29:48,930 --> 02:29:53,033
[SPEAKER_24]: It's National Registry of Historic Places, so that is a historical asset.

1647
02:29:53,694 --> 02:29:57,777
[SPEAKER_24]: I will say that it is very much eligible under Department of Revenue

1648
02:29:58,297 --> 02:29:59,637
[SPEAKER_24]: we're looking at.

1649
02:29:59,657 --> 02:29:59,838
[SPEAKER_24]: Guidance.

1650
02:29:59,858 --> 02:30:03,999
[SPEAKER_24]: Um whether or not it's necessarily a priority of the Community Preservation Committee.

1651
02:30:04,019 --> 02:30:10,601
[SPEAKER_24]: That is one thing we will be looking at our guidelines for future applications as it pertains to private entities.

1652
02:30:11,621 --> 02:30:15,402
[SPEAKER_24]: We felt the committee felt very strongly that this is an asset for the city of

1653
02:30:21,084 --> 02:30:26,809
[SPEAKER_24]: So we felt that this was a good partnership for the immediate move of fixing this emergency funding.

1654
02:30:27,330 --> 02:30:28,391
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the total cost?

1655
02:30:28,951 --> 02:30:32,114
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe the total cost for the project is somewhere around $800,000.

1656
02:30:32,214 --> 02:30:38,420
[SPEAKER_24]: They're intending to phase that in over the next few years so that it's not a huge financial burden to the organization.

1657
02:30:41,402 --> 02:30:41,883
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1658
02:30:41,903 --> 02:30:44,325
[SPEAKER_28]: Do we have any other comment from members of the public on this?

1659
02:30:45,106 --> 02:30:47,127
[SPEAKER_28]: Seeing Mr. Fiori, name and address for the record.

1660
02:30:47,147 --> 02:30:47,628
[SPEAKER_28]: You have three minutes.

1661
02:30:48,564 --> 02:31:02,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President Gaston fear 61 stinger actually Andy basically asked my question so what is exactly what makes this private building, able to receive these funds that is what.

1662
02:31:05,415 --> 02:31:11,939
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, as it does have special designation as a, yes, it's a protected building under the National Registry of Historic Places.

1663
02:31:12,179 --> 02:31:27,148
[SPEAKER_24]: And again, the committee doesn't wanna set any sort of precedence for private ownership, but under historic preservation, under the Department of Revenue guidance, if it meets these certain parameters, which it does, we are able to fund private entities.

1664
02:31:27,488 --> 02:31:34,273
[SPEAKER_24]: And again, it's not something we wanna set precedence for, and we will be reevaluating our guidelines going forwards just so that we can

1665
02:31:35,013 --> 02:31:35,853
[SPEAKER_24]: kind of head these off.

1666
02:31:37,274 --> 02:31:38,534
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was my concern.

1667
02:31:38,574 --> 02:31:40,115
[SPEAKER_07]: So setting precedent.

1668
02:31:40,175 --> 02:31:49,419
[SPEAKER_07]: So how many buildings are under the same condition that then because we funded this particular project could come and say, well, we're in the same condition.

1669
02:31:49,459 --> 02:31:50,119
[SPEAKER_07]: And don't get me wrong.

1670
02:31:50,159 --> 02:31:52,000
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if it's an emergency, something needs to be done.

1671
02:31:53,981 --> 02:31:58,222
[SPEAKER_07]: But we could be setting precedent here that then some of the buildings are in the same condition.

1672
02:31:58,242 --> 02:31:59,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know whether any.

1673
02:31:59,783 --> 02:32:02,364
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's something worthwhile to take a look.

1674
02:32:02,404 --> 02:32:03,705
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, if there's an emergency,

1675
02:32:04,781 --> 02:32:13,330
[SPEAKER_07]: I will approve this tonight, but I think it requires further consideration, given that it's taxpayers' money, right?

1676
02:32:13,370 --> 02:32:17,354
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and then the second part is that what are we getting in return after this?

1677
02:32:17,474 --> 02:32:24,461
[SPEAKER_07]: So, because it says here, after this gets solved and the emergency gets addressed, which is the priority, I want to re-emphasize that.

1678
02:32:25,683 --> 02:32:37,216
[SPEAKER_07]: It says the applicant will work with the Community Preservation Act manager to coordinate one to two public events annually for a 10-year period in which the project building at 92 High School will be open to the public.

1679
02:32:37,236 --> 02:32:43,503
[SPEAKER_07]: So if it's a private building, what does it mean that the building will be open to the public?

1680
02:32:45,292 --> 02:32:46,793
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I'm not familiar with the building.

1681
02:32:46,833 --> 02:32:56,536
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just asking questions as someone that as a resident that is concerned about how our taxpayers money is being used, and knows nothing about this building.

1682
02:32:56,696 --> 02:32:58,857
[SPEAKER_07]: And obviously, I want to prioritize the emergency.

1683
02:32:58,877 --> 02:32:59,957
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to repeat that.

1684
02:33:00,557 --> 02:33:02,178
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm worried about present.

1685
02:33:02,818 --> 02:33:06,119
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm also worried about is just giving the money and then that's it?

1686
02:33:06,519 --> 02:33:08,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is this a loan at zero interest?

1687
02:33:09,136 --> 02:33:10,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this something else?

1688
02:33:13,561 --> 02:33:15,122
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are my questions.

1689
02:33:15,262 --> 02:33:15,463
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1690
02:33:15,483 --> 02:33:15,843
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1691
02:33:15,903 --> 02:33:19,647
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, my understanding is this an appropriation, so the money would go directly to them.

1692
02:33:20,067 --> 02:33:22,650
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know if you want to add some information.

1693
02:33:22,950 --> 02:33:28,897
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to clarify the condition of the funding to open up the doors for public events.

1694
02:33:29,017 --> 02:33:29,898
[SPEAKER_24]: They will be working

1695
02:33:30,398 --> 02:33:38,803
[SPEAKER_24]: through me through the mayor's office on organizing, you know, the coffee and cookies visits with veterans office to open up their doors so that that is being posted there.

1696
02:33:38,823 --> 02:33:49,009
[SPEAKER_24]: So effectively, just kind of making the building a little bit, having more of a direct public benefit beyond just having it be an asset of the city.

1697
02:33:51,170 --> 02:33:52,031
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1698
02:33:53,780 --> 02:33:54,240
[SPEAKER_28]: One second.

1699
02:33:55,121 --> 02:33:55,521
[SPEAKER_28]: Go ahead.

1700
02:33:55,781 --> 02:33:56,061
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm sorry.

1701
02:33:56,102 --> 02:33:57,342
[SPEAKER_32]: I know you do so much work.

1702
02:33:57,362 --> 02:34:10,310
[SPEAKER_32]: I know I brought this up in the past and your comment was that community preservation, the, I won't bring up what that location was, but you said it was part of the community and it was historical.

1703
02:34:10,350 --> 02:34:13,072
[SPEAKER_32]: So, but again, I think that Ms.

1704
02:34:13,112 --> 02:34:14,213
[SPEAKER_32]: Fiora brings up a good point.

1705
02:34:14,833 --> 02:34:35,237
[SPEAKER_32]: that as we move forward, I think that, meaning that it's an emergency, and I feel that this is, as a person who supported the Community Preservation Act and understanding that saving these locations are very important, especially in the city of Medford, which is the key, I think that legally

1706
02:34:36,467 --> 02:34:45,849
[SPEAKER_32]: If it starts getting into a slippery slope, I think that as we move forward, I just let you know that I'll be reaching out more in depth because I think that

1707
02:34:47,787 --> 02:34:48,948
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. Fiora brings up a good point.

1708
02:34:49,528 --> 02:35:04,297
[SPEAKER_32]: If today is one thing, it could be another location with another home and a person can buy a historical home and say, well, I can't afford the windows, let me apply to the CPA and just assume you're gonna pay for the windows.

1709
02:35:04,978 --> 02:35:06,739
[SPEAKER_32]: And I know that that's not the intent.

1710
02:35:06,779 --> 02:35:12,682
[SPEAKER_32]: So again, I think that that's something that you've been working, you have your due diligence and you're doing your due diligence with that.

1711
02:35:13,183 --> 02:35:14,664
[SPEAKER_32]: And I appreciate that.

1712
02:35:15,834 --> 02:35:16,515
[SPEAKER_32]: share that with you.

1713
02:35:16,555 --> 02:35:19,719
[SPEAKER_32]: So I think the component was the community piece.

1714
02:35:19,819 --> 02:35:20,880
[SPEAKER_32]: So yes, thank you.

1715
02:35:21,301 --> 02:35:22,242
[SPEAKER_24]: And thank you for your comments.

1716
02:35:22,262 --> 02:35:28,048
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, but the community is not interested in funding private entities going forward.

1717
02:35:28,068 --> 02:35:33,415
[SPEAKER_24]: This was just a very unique situation with a unique building for a relatively small ask.

1718
02:35:33,535 --> 02:35:35,437
[SPEAKER_24]: So and again, within our

1719
02:35:36,137 --> 02:35:37,077
[SPEAKER_24]: eligibility here.

1720
02:35:37,097 --> 02:35:38,278
[SPEAKER_24]: We were very diligent on that.

1721
02:35:38,318 --> 02:35:43,700
[SPEAKER_24]: We actually coursed this application over the two meetings just to really discuss it and have some.

1722
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:44,820
[SPEAKER_32]: So it's not some thorough.

1723
02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:47,822
[SPEAKER_32]: It wasn't so the public knows not taken out of thin air.

1724
02:35:47,862 --> 02:35:49,662
[SPEAKER_32]: You didn't just make something arbitrarily.

1725
02:35:50,062 --> 02:35:52,983
[SPEAKER_32]: It's in the bylaws and discussion aligns with that.

1726
02:35:53,004 --> 02:35:54,044
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you.

1727
02:35:54,284 --> 02:35:55,905
[SPEAKER_24]: And I appreciate the commentary.

1728
02:35:56,485 --> 02:35:56,765
[SPEAKER_24]: Truly.

1729
02:35:59,006 --> 02:35:59,266
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1730
02:35:59,286 --> 02:36:04,588
[SPEAKER_28]: We have any other questions for Councilor Tala and for Manager Dupont?

1731
02:36:07,009 --> 02:36:07,750
[SPEAKER_24]: Did I just get promoted?

1732
02:36:07,810 --> 02:36:08,530
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, I'm a councilor.

1733
02:36:09,050 --> 02:36:10,932
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, I just got you two confused.

1734
02:36:10,952 --> 02:36:12,453
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know how.

1735
02:36:15,255 --> 02:36:21,159
[SPEAKER_28]: On the motion to approve by Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Callahan.
