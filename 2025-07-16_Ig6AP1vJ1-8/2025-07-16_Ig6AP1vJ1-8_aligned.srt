Seven present, none absent, please rise to salute the flag.

20
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:56,126
Announcements, accolades, remembrances, reports, and records, 25119 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

21
00:10:56,646 --> 00:11:04,310
Be it resolved that we offer our deepest and sincerest condolences to the family of Brian Deeb Hilliard, a fixture in our community for almost 30 years.

22
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:12,054
Brian was a uniquely talented trumpet player who turned his musical skills into a successful music booking agency, occasional brass and strings.

23
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:18,177
We offer our sympathies to Brian's wife, Stacey, his children, Duncan and Owen, his extended family, and his many friends.

24
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:19,378
Councilor Scarpelli.

25
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,126
Thank you, Mr. President.

26
00:11:23,326 --> 00:11:31,791
I thank a fellow clerk that also was instrumental in getting this, putting this resolution forward.

27
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:45,040
When you hear passing of members of our community and when they get to a certain age, you realize that you wish they lived a good life and they're moving on.

28
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:51,224
But when you heard that Mr. Hilliard passed, it hit you right in the gut.

29
00:11:52,756 --> 00:12:06,039
I've known him as a dad and as a resident, and everybody knew him as a giving musician, and everybody talks about his trumpet playing and the impact he's left in the music community.

30
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,820
But more importantly, it's what he left back as a husband and a dad.

31
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:18,982
Very close to my children's age, and Owen and Duncan, and it's something that

32
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:30,403
We want to thank Brian for his commitment and love of Medford and his commitment to his family, his wife, Stacey.

33
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:44,547
This is something that we've said it often when we lose some community members, but Brian Hillard's passing will definitely be forever missed.

34
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:49,269
So I send the deepest condolences to Owen, Duncan, and Stacey.

35
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:57,158
We, if we ever, if they ever need anything, we should be there for them.

36
00:12:57,198 --> 00:12:57,738
So thank you.

37
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,900
Thank you, Councilor Scarapelli.

38
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,580
Councilor Sang.

39
00:13:03,922 --> 00:13:08,846
Thank you, Councilor Scarapelli for putting this on the agenda and for your kind words.

40
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:16,291
It's a difficult moment for the Hilliard family and I want to send my deepest condolences as well.

41
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:18,152
I went to school at Duncan and

42
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:32,144
It's tough to say anything because I think it hits particularly hard when it's a family of someone you know.

43
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:51,648
I think I just want to send my best thoughts and recognize Mr. Hilliard's really wonderful life and legacy, his wonderful family.

44
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:55,629
I think it's hard for me to gather my thoughts, too.

45
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:13,151
You know, it does come as, you know, a shock to the community, especially, I think, I know a lot of us were at the Memorial Day event recently, and Mr. Hilliard played some really beautiful, moving music there.

46
00:14:13,472 --> 00:14:23,259
And I just wanna, you know, say on the behalf of Benford City Council that we send our deepest condolences to the family.

47
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:26,361
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

48
00:14:26,401 --> 00:14:27,102
Councilor Zaro.

49
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:39,718
Thank you, I wanted to share that I heard about Mr. Hilliard's passing from the Medford Boat Club, sent out an email.

50
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:41,600
I'm a member of the boat club.

51
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:53,731
He was a very active member and he organized the Hawaiian night and just his family was very active and continue to be very active.

52
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:54,791
So on behalf of the,

53
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,381
book club community, he'll be hugely missed.

54
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:03,524
It's really a huge tragedy and I'm so sorry for his family and for the whole city.

55
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:09,628
It's never easy and our hearts go up.

56
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:12,990
So best wishes to his family.

57
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,752
I hope they can get through this difficult time.

58
00:15:17,914 --> 00:15:18,274
Thank you.

59
00:15:18,294 --> 00:15:19,094
Councilor Lemming.

60
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:22,056
I remember Mr. Hilliard,

61
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,919
played at the Memorial Day Ceremony, the Patriots Day Ceremony.

62
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:35,521
And this one, it kind of closed home for me because my dad, he's a professional trumpet player.

63
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:44,804
And so anytime I see a trumpet player there representing the community, the musicians, I take note of them.

64
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:48,525
Went up to Mr. Hilliard, had a conversation.

65
00:15:48,565 --> 00:15:50,966
I wanted to get to know him better.

66
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:58,854
So when I saw that, when I saw he passed away, it was a shock.

67
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:00,914
Every community needs its musicians.

68
00:16:01,654 --> 00:16:06,116
Every community needs people there to play taps.

69
00:16:06,276 --> 00:16:13,058
Every community needs music and without Mr. Hilliard, Medford's lost that.

70
00:16:14,638 --> 00:16:21,440
So my condolences to his family and thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this resolution.

71
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:24,594
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

72
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:28,157
It looks like we do have one comment from a member of the public.

73
00:16:29,798 --> 00:16:33,041
I recognize Bill Giglio, you have three minutes.

74
00:16:33,341 --> 00:16:37,845
Name and address for the record, please.

75
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:39,867
I want to thank George also for putting this on.

76
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:42,349
This is very deeply saddening.

77
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:51,617
I met Ryan when my, when our oldest boy started kindergarten and our youngest boys went to kindergarten together and they played sports.

78
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:55,212
everything and I knew them throughout the years and they're just a great film.

79
00:16:55,252 --> 00:17:02,857
And I loved, like everybody else, I liked seeing Brian down at the, um, the cemetery, the Memorial Day and the Patriots days and everything like that.

80
00:17:02,877 --> 00:17:13,222
And just running into him every now and then that, uh, like I seen Stacey the other day and I'm told I was very glad I could at least say hi to him one last time, but it's very, this is very heartbreaking.

81
00:17:13,262 --> 00:17:15,604
So thank you George for putting this on and thank you for everybody else.

82
00:17:17,665 --> 00:17:19,386
Hey, could we have your name and address for the record please?

83
00:17:19,486 --> 00:17:19,706
Yeah.

84
00:17:19,946 --> 00:17:21,807
Uh, bill Giglio, uh, winter street method.

85
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,235
Thank you.

86
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:39,004
Seeing no further comments either in person or on Zoom on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

87
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:41,366
We'll call the roll and then we'll take a moment of silence.

88
00:17:41,446 --> 00:17:42,506
Please call the roll, Mr. Clerk.

89
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:47,329
Councilor Callahan.

90
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,190
Vice President Collins.

91
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:52,063
Councilor Lazzaro?

92
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:52,784
Yes.

93
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:54,386
Councilor Lemming?

94
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,247
Yes.

95
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:55,907
Councilor Scarpelli?

96
00:17:55,927 --> 00:17:55,988
Yes.

97
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:57,529
Councilor Singh?

98
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:58,510
Yes.

99
00:17:59,452 --> 00:18:00,012
President Behrs?

100
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:00,373
Yes.

101
00:18:00,493 --> 00:18:02,595
Having the affirmative and none in the negative, the motion passes.

102
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,558
Please rise if you're able for a moment of silence.

103
00:18:26,342 --> 00:18:49,021
Paper 25112 offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council recognize the Tufts University Government and Community Relations Team comprised of Medford's own Rocco DiRico, Liza Perry, Leah Boudreau, Maggie Carroll, and Aaron Braddock for being honored with receipt of the Tufts University Distinction Award recognizing their exceptional accomplishments.

104
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:49,982
Councilor Scarpelli.

105
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,359
Thank you, Mr. President.

106
00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:01,422
Tufts University seems to be a lightning rod, and it was funny, for one resident that called and said, George, they're building a monstrosity.

107
00:19:02,322 --> 00:19:12,226
I tend to agree with them, but this is for recognition for a team of professionals that, as for one counselor and one school kid member for many, many years,

108
00:19:12,893 --> 00:19:27,623
whether it be Barbara or Rocco and his team that have always been there, whether they were going to get their butts kicked for an issue that Tufts didn't follow through with or something we think that they should have done more.

109
00:19:27,844 --> 00:19:33,468
And I just wanted to send congratulations for their hard work.

110
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:38,111
And again, thank them for always picking up the phone and

111
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:44,327
at least giving us the information we need so we can serve our constituents better.

112
00:19:44,408 --> 00:19:45,568
So thank you, Mr. President.

113
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:48,489
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

114
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:51,070

115
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:54,692

25105, that's the local investments ordinance proposal.

180
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:53,362
And to take paper 25118 out of order, that's the amendment to the personnel ordinance civil project manager.

00:22:53,382 --> 00:22:54,703

186

Looks like we have the City Engineer.

207
00:24:34,217 --> 00:24:36,539
Do we have the Chief of Staff?

208
00:24:42,623 --> 00:24:44,805
I don't see the Chief of Staff, so you're on, Owen.

209
00:24:49,017 --> 00:24:51,858
Thank you for allowing me to speak on this.

210
00:24:51,898 --> 00:25:05,365
We're looking for some help in the engineering division, and this job position will open up some opportunity for us to distribute, you know, the workload.

211
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,468
Do we have questions for the city engineer from members of the council?

212
00:25:15,491 --> 00:25:16,231
Councilor Callahan.

213
00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:25,469
Yeah, if you could just let me know a little bit about the make up union, non union of the engineering staff.

214
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:31,273
Um, our whole staff is non union, except for the clerk who is union.

215
00:25:31,653 --> 00:25:31,873
Okay.

216
00:25:32,473 --> 00:25:32,714
Okay.

217
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:33,274
Thank you.

218
00:25:33,854 --> 00:25:40,318
Do you have any other questions for the city engineer from members of the council?

219
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:43,960
Seeing none.

220
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,981
Is there a motion?

221
00:25:48,707 --> 00:25:50,788

222
00:25:50,808 --> 00:25:51,208

When you're ready, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

226
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:11,697

227

Yes.

228
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:13,598
Vice President Collins?

229
00:26:13,998 --> 00:26:14,218
Yes.

230
00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:16,219
Councilor Lozaro?

231
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:17,540
Yes.

232
00:26:19,092 --> 00:26:23,937
Councilor Lemming, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Sang.

233
00:26:24,537 --> 00:26:24,878
Yes.

234
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:32,705
Yes, I'm in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes and the ordinance is moved for first reading.

235
00:26:33,686 --> 00:26:42,575
Hearings, public hearing, proposed amendments to the Medford zoning ordinance, chapter 94, Medford Square and West Medford Square districts to be continued to a date certain.

236
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:53,933
Whereas we haven't received any recommendations from the Community Development Board on these proposed ordinances, we need to continue the hearing to a date certain.

237
00:26:53,953 --> 00:26:57,253
So I'm going to open the hearing and then we can hear a motion.

238
00:26:59,214 --> 00:27:00,134
The hearing is open.

239
00:27:01,655 --> 00:27:02,735
Vice President Collins.

240
00:27:04,275 --> 00:27:05,116
Thank you, President Behrs.

241
00:27:05,216 --> 00:27:09,757
I would motion to continue this public hearing to the September 9th regular meeting.

242
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:18,226
On the motion of Vice President Collins to continue the public hearing to the September 9th regular meeting, seconded by seconded by Councilor Lemming.

243
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:20,086
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

244
00:27:27,989 --> 00:27:28,630
Councilor Callahan?

245
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:30,590
Vice President Collins?

246
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:31,291
Yes.

247
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:33,191
Councilor Lozaro?

248
00:27:34,072 --> 00:27:34,372
Yes.

249
00:27:35,592 --> 00:27:36,032
Councilor Lemming?

250
00:27:36,052 --> 00:27:36,112
Yes.

251
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,193
Councilor Scarpelli?

252
00:27:38,213 --> 00:27:38,293
Yes.

253
00:27:39,894 --> 00:27:40,434
Councilor Singh?

254
00:27:41,108 --> 00:27:42,869
Yes.

255
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,591
Yes, so many affirmative, none the negative.

256
00:27:46,112 --> 00:28:00,382
The public hearing is continued to September 9 2025 petitions presentations and similar papers to 5120 petition for a class to auto license obese auto service and collision LLC.

257
00:28:02,657 --> 00:28:11,822
Dear Clark Herbies, in close for filing, please find petitioner's application for a new class two auto dealer used car license, used car sales license, including the application in the city council.

259
00:28:24,975 --> 00:28:29,518
signed Kathleen Desmond representing OBE's Auto Service Inclusion LLC.

260
00:28:29,738 --> 00:28:34,321
I will recognize Councilor Scarpelli, Chair of the Subcommittee on Licensing, Permitting, and Science.

261
00:28:38,043 --> 00:28:46,148
For our professional at the, to give us a brief synopsis, I know that we've been working on this.

262
00:28:46,328 --> 00:28:49,110
If the petitioner could provide a brief synopsis of the proposal.

263
00:28:50,171 --> 00:28:50,991
One second, Kathy.

264
00:28:51,472 --> 00:28:51,752
There you go.

265
00:28:52,655 --> 00:28:53,116
Can I move it?

266
00:28:53,656 --> 00:28:54,938
Thank you.

267
00:28:55,118 --> 00:28:58,582
Good evening, President Villescaz, Vice President Collins, City Council members.

268
00:29:03,397 --> 00:29:04,357
service and collision.

269
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:13,940
Before you tonight, you have a request for a class two dealer's license to sell what is a limited number of vehicles, not to exceed nine on the premises.

270
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,961
We went before the Board of Appeals in June of 2024.

271
00:29:18,141 --> 00:29:27,384
The property is located in a C1 district that allows for new sales, but not for used vehicle sales.

272
00:29:27,804 --> 00:29:31,905
We obtained a used variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals

273
00:29:32,865 --> 00:29:41,950
On the basis that the property is a 31,000-square-foot parcel of land, there's an 8,300-square-foot building that houses the repair and auto body shop.

274
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:52,575
The remaining portion of the premises is a substantial yard area where there would be the ability to park up to nine used vehicles.

275
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:53,695
for sale.

276
00:29:54,015 --> 00:29:58,056
The petitioner proposes to provide a limited number for sale on site.

277
00:29:59,336 --> 00:30:01,997
Presently there's 25 exterior parking spaces.

278
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:10,639
It's anticipated that the average number of vehicles that he would have at any one time on the property would be six vehicles.

279
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:16,440
He is engaged in the auto body repair shop, which is a requirement for a class two dealership that you have

280
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,562
somewhere where the vehicles can be brought for warranty work.

281
00:30:20,363 --> 00:30:29,209
As part of his auto body business, he frequently has customers that, for one reason or another, don't want to spend the money to have their car fixed.

282
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:39,336
And he would have the opportunity, if those cars were still viable, to purchase those and put them on sale, probably less expensive used cars for the public.

283
00:30:39,516 --> 00:30:42,198
In addition, he deals with people whose cars have been totaled.

284
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:52,885
and don't have a vehicle and this would provide him again with an opportunity to provide those people with a used vehicle for them to purchase.

285
00:30:55,858 --> 00:31:00,261
As indicated, we were able to get a use variance for that purpose.

286
00:31:00,862 --> 00:31:08,428
At the time, we had a number of neighbors to the property which were in favor of the variance.

287
00:31:08,648 --> 00:31:09,509
Neighbors very close.

288
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:11,330
They have their cars repaired there.

289
00:31:12,391 --> 00:31:16,214
Obie's Auto Collision has a five-star review for

290
00:31:18,536 --> 00:31:22,279
He's been in business in the city for five years previous to that.

291
00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:24,160
He worked for Fantasia.

292
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:31,707
Part of the restrictions that we discussed with the Board of Appeals is that he is not going to change the hours of operations.

293
00:31:31,727 --> 00:31:34,209
So there will be no weekend and night operations.

294
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:35,390
It's going to be a 9 to 5.

295
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,591
I believe it's 9 to 5.

296
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:37,212
It might be 8 to 5.

297
00:31:38,513 --> 00:31:39,973
operation Monday through Friday.

298
00:31:39,994 --> 00:31:43,856
There's no additional salesperson that are being introduced.

299
00:31:44,456 --> 00:31:49,820
There's going to be no advertising on site or vehicles in the front of the property.

300
00:31:49,880 --> 00:32:02,028
It's only basically internet sales and then sales to existing customers who are looking for a modest second-hand car in instances where they might be desperate because their car's been totaled.

301
00:32:02,728 --> 00:32:09,791
And he has, you know, in order to do this type of thing, if we weren't granted the use variance, then he would have to move to another location.

302
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:11,331
And it just doesn't make sense.

303
00:32:11,351 --> 00:32:16,053
He's got his auto business there with the repair station right on site to deal with this.

304
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:20,875
And again, we're only looking for a limited number of vehicles, not to exceed nine.

305
00:32:22,715 --> 00:32:23,095
Thank you.

306
00:32:23,155 --> 00:32:24,056
Councilor Scarpelli.

307
00:32:24,456 --> 00:32:25,416
Thank you, Mr. President.

308
00:32:25,436 --> 00:32:27,957
So I see everything in order.

309
00:32:27,977 --> 00:32:30,058
I think one of the biggest questions that

310
00:32:31,884 --> 00:32:43,694
was brought up maybe by one neighbor is that with the cars there, as you're doing the body work, that the overflow would then go on the streets and the side streets and affect neighborhood parking.

311
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:49,499
So, I mean, I would, this business has never had an issue, Mr. President.

312
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:57,085
I don't know if we can add just a 30 day, 60 day, 90 day review, just to make sure that there's not overflow.

313
00:32:57,806 --> 00:32:59,467
I don't see any other issue here, so.

314
00:33:01,716 --> 00:33:03,517
Do you have any other questions from members of the council?

315
00:33:03,597 --> 00:33:03,697
No.

316
00:33:06,457 --> 00:33:14,680
Seeing none, we have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to approve with a 30, 60, and 90 day review, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

317
00:33:17,521 --> 00:33:23,343
Seeing no further discussion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll to approve as amended.

318
00:33:24,383 --> 00:33:25,063
Councilor Callahan.

319
00:33:25,983 --> 00:33:26,804
Vice President Collins.

320
00:33:28,644 --> 00:33:28,884
Yes.

321
00:33:30,305 --> 00:33:31,085
Councilor Lozaro.

322
00:33:32,142 --> 00:33:32,422
Yes.

323
00:33:33,322 --> 00:33:33,863
Councilor Lemming.

324
00:33:34,543 --> 00:33:35,263
Councilor Scarpelli.

325
00:33:35,483 --> 00:33:35,743
Yes.

326
00:33:36,024 --> 00:33:36,584
Councilor Singh.

327
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:37,444
Yes.

328
00:33:38,324 --> 00:33:38,925
President Behrs.

329
00:33:39,265 --> 00:33:39,545
Yes.

330
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:41,746
Having the affirmative and then the negative, the motion passes.

331
00:33:41,806 --> 00:33:42,146
Thank you.

332
00:33:43,186 --> 00:33:52,150
Mr. President, we move to suspend the rules to take a public participation.

333
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:57,032
On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli to suspend the rules to take public participation.

334
00:33:57,172 --> 00:33:57,712
Seconded by?

335
00:33:59,127 --> 00:34:00,348
Seconded by Councilor Lemming.

336
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:02,469
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

337
00:34:18,961 --> 00:34:19,562
Councilor Callahan.

338
00:34:20,762 --> 00:34:21,563
Vice President Collins.

339
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:22,163
Yes.

340
00:34:23,624 --> 00:34:24,385
Councilor Lozaro.

341
00:34:25,286 --> 00:34:25,526
No.

342
00:34:27,627 --> 00:34:28,108
Councilor Lemming.

343
00:34:32,346 --> 00:34:33,649
I'm sorry to hear.

344
00:34:33,789 --> 00:34:34,049
Yeah.

345
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:35,672
Councilor Scarpelli.

346
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:36,053
Yes.

347
00:34:36,734 --> 00:34:37,235
Councilor Sang.

348
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:38,156
Yes.

349
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:44,221
Yes, 60 affirmative one of the negative the motion passes public participation.

350
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:52,603
Greg Collins, July 10 2025 to the Honorable City Council, the undersigned respectfully request for tree removal.

351
00:34:52,844 --> 00:34:54,924
I am a homeowner in Medford since 2016.

352
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:58,365
I'm currently in the process of building a new home on Walcott Street.

353
00:34:58,505 --> 00:35:03,127
Unfortunately, I need to remove a tree located on a public sidewalk in order to have a functioning driveway.

354
00:35:03,785 --> 00:35:14,096
I follow the protocols with the tree warden DPW, and they have ignored my rightful due process to have a public hearing in order to remove the tree petitioner's name Greg Collins residents 41 Fulton Street 77 Walcott Street, Greg.

355
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:19,770
You have the floor, you have three minutes.

356
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,651
Thank you, City Council.

357
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:23,093
So let me just introduce myself.

358
00:35:23,113 --> 00:35:24,154
My name is Greg Collins.

359
00:35:24,734 --> 00:35:27,697
I purchased my first house in Medford in 2016.

360
00:35:28,537 --> 00:35:37,004
My grandfather grew up on Forest Street during World War II, and so Medford's always kind of been a theme in my family.

361
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:38,205
Love the city.

362
00:35:40,247 --> 00:35:42,709
So I'm building a house on Walcott Street.

363
00:35:44,718 --> 00:35:51,384
Part of the construction, we bumped out part of the front where the existing driveway was.

364
00:35:52,164 --> 00:36:01,932
And so essentially, in the plans, we have to have the driveway go up along the left side of the house where there's 10 feet of clearance.

365
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:12,741
And so there is a tree currently on that side of the house.

366
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:35,034
And so I would like to go through the process through the DPPW to remove the tree, go through the public hearing process, see if the public has any, you know, objection to moving the tree so that we can put in a driveway so that the family can functionally live in this house.

367
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:40,495
And so my understanding and what's on the website is that

368
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:53,632
Trees cannot be removed unless the tree warden or the deputy deems the tree unhealthy or dead or approved through a public hearing.

369
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:57,792
Public hearings are requested in writing to the tree warden.

370
00:36:59,813 --> 00:37:04,093
So I requested this hearing back in early May.

371
00:37:04,113 --> 00:37:11,795
Excuse me, I have a whole list of dates, but I'll just try to summarize it for you guys.

372
00:37:13,376 --> 00:37:16,338
I talked to Aggie about having the hearing.

373
00:37:16,418 --> 00:37:17,278
She said it was okay.

374
00:37:17,298 --> 00:37:31,505
She explained, okay, well, we're gonna take the circumference of the tree if the public doesn't have any objection to it, and we'll have to plant four to six more trees in the neighborhood if we take the tree down.

375
00:37:31,985 --> 00:37:33,926
And that sounds fine.

376
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:37,768
I'm fine with paying for the new trees and going through the public hearing process.

377
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:40,590
That seems like a fair trade-off.

378
00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:59,091
So this all started back in May and really there's just this long period of silence from the DPW and Aggie and you know I'm trying to be very patient because I understand that you know there's reasons for some of the delays.

379
00:37:59,992 --> 00:38:04,016
I'm trying to be very cordial but I was really basically ignored up until

380
00:38:05,237 --> 00:38:10,440
July 10th, I finally got an attorney to reach out to the mayor's office to say, what's going on?

381
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,221
Like, they're not responding to my emails.

382
00:38:12,321 --> 00:38:17,924
I go to the office, they tell me that, oh, I'm gonna get a call back, nothing, just silence.

383
00:38:19,845 --> 00:38:31,951
And so, all I'm asking for is what's on the Medford City website to have a public hearing to see if anyone has any objection to removing the tree.

384
00:38:33,508 --> 00:38:36,028
If there's objection from a public, then that's fine.

385
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:39,529
But that's how the democratic process works.

386
00:38:40,229 --> 00:38:41,349
And I'd be fine with that.

387
00:38:41,529 --> 00:38:44,850
But all I'm asking for is to go through that process.

388
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:52,331
And it appears that the tree warden and the DPW is just not worth their time to do that.

389
00:38:53,392 --> 00:39:00,233
And so I'm just here to bring that to the council and just let you guys know that

390
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,049
You know, I'm a member of the community.

391
00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:08,411
I demand, you know, I should have the same respect as anyone else.

392
00:39:08,831 --> 00:39:15,493
And I would just like to have some guidance on this.

393
00:39:15,693 --> 00:39:16,253
Thank you.

394
00:39:16,513 --> 00:39:17,713
I'll recognize Councilor Scarpelli.

395
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:21,334
And then I did receive an email from the DPW commissioner on this matter that I can read.

396
00:39:21,354 --> 00:39:23,235
I yield to you, Mr. President.

397
00:39:23,705 --> 00:39:24,225
Thank you.

398
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:26,566
So thanks for being here tonight.

399
00:39:26,626 --> 00:39:27,766
Appreciate your petition.

400
00:39:28,726 --> 00:39:36,248
As you probably know, considering you've been going through this for a few months, the public shade tree and the public hearings are governed by mass general law.

401
00:39:37,268 --> 00:39:38,629
And the council doesn't have a role in them.

402
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:44,910
But of course, you know, we do hear from folks in this space about many things that are going on in the city.

403
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,891
I'm going to read this response.

404
00:39:46,911 --> 00:39:47,291
It is not

405
00:39:48,295 --> 00:39:50,537
My, uh, it's not coming from me.

406
00:39:50,577 --> 00:39:52,259
It's coming from the DPW commissioner.

407
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,882
He wrote me after the agenda went out.

408
00:39:55,002 --> 00:39:56,203
Good morning, President Behrs.

409
00:39:56,383 --> 00:40:03,190
I wanted to bring to your attention information regarding the issue with Mr. Greg Collins and the public tree that is on your agenda for next week.

410
00:40:03,812 --> 00:40:07,516
Mr. Collins has not granted a permit from the tree warden to remove a public shade tree.

411
00:40:08,016 --> 00:40:08,837
He would like a hearing.

412
00:40:08,997 --> 00:40:13,241
However, hearings are required when a permit is issued to remove or take down a public shade tree.

413
00:40:13,742 --> 00:40:16,564
Despite his claims, the tree warden has been responsive to him.

414
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:25,213
It is also worth noting that the building project began prior to the proponent receiving plan approval at the engineering division for elements such as the ROW curb cut.

415
00:40:25,834 --> 00:40:28,796
Unfortunately, the desired driveway for the project would eliminate a tree.

416
00:40:29,317 --> 00:40:33,199
The proponent asked to remove the tree, and the tree warden said no, denying the permission.

417
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:40,144
Typically, site plans are approved at the engineering division prior to building, and especially if there are new curb cut locations.

418
00:40:40,265 --> 00:40:45,468
Mr. Collins is now represented by an attorney, and the communication has moved from the DPW to the city solicitor.

419
00:40:45,488 --> 00:40:46,669
I hope this helps.

420
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:47,950
Regards, Tim.

421
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:50,452
I can recognize Councilor Scarpelli.

422
00:40:57,003 --> 00:41:06,331
you know, if that answer isn't efficient or it doesn't, then I'll gladly reach out to you tomorrow.

423
00:41:06,371 --> 00:41:09,514
I'll call the city solicitor myself and see if there's a way we can help, so.

424
00:41:12,897 --> 00:41:21,120
Like, you know, weeks or months ago, all I was looking for was for some kind of response from the DPW commissioner from Aggie.

425
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,481
But like I said, it was just silence for months.

426
00:41:24,161 --> 00:41:26,982
And I'm trying to, you know, I was trying to be very patient with everyone.

427
00:41:27,831 --> 00:41:29,813
But I haven't even heard that from the commissioner.

428
00:41:29,873 --> 00:41:31,554
So now I'm hearing it for the first time.

429
00:41:32,755 --> 00:41:35,317
So again, I'll talk to my attorney and see what I can do.

430
00:41:35,377 --> 00:41:41,682
And first and foremost, I want to be continuing to be having a good relationship with the city.

431
00:41:41,702 --> 00:41:46,966
I plan on having my house here for many years to come.

432
00:41:47,066 --> 00:41:53,030
So it's important to me that I have a good relationship with everyone and hope we can get this sorted out.

433
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:54,792
And that's it.

434
00:41:57,244 --> 00:41:57,584
Thank you.

435
00:41:57,604 --> 00:42:03,370
I appreciate your time coming down and Councillor Scarpelli as well for your offer.

436
00:42:06,334 --> 00:42:08,256
Continuing in public participation.

437
00:42:10,038 --> 00:42:13,121
If you'd like to speak in public participation, you'll have three minutes.

438
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:16,685
You can raise your hand on Zoom or come to the podium in person.

439
00:42:16,725 --> 00:42:19,708
We will alternate between the podium and Zoom.

440
00:42:28,733 --> 00:42:29,114
Hi there.

441
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:30,876
Name and address for the record, please.

442
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:31,898
And you'll have three minutes.

443
00:42:32,098 --> 00:42:32,659
Yes.

444
00:42:32,779 --> 00:42:41,131
My name is Rahma, but I'm here on behalf of SEIU 32BJ and our member Maria is going to read a short statement and then I'll translate it in English.

445
00:42:44,757 --> 00:43:07,871
mi nombre es maria coto limpia la escuela secundaria medford intermedia durante 10 años disfruté mi trabajo y estaba orgullosa de proporcionar un ambiente de aprendizaje limpio y sanitario para los estudiantes de medford mis compañeras de trabajo y yo teníamos salarios justos beneficios y condiciones laborales bajo un contrato sindical con

446
00:43:09,552 --> 00:43:11,854
S-E-I-U-32-B-J.

447
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:20,441
Sin embargo, el distrito ahora ha concedido su contrato de limpieza a una nueva empresa llamada Partners Facility Solutions.

448
00:43:21,702 --> 00:43:32,171
Es una empresa no sindical que se negó a contratarme a mí y a mis compañeras de trabajo a pesar de varios intentos de postular el sindicato.

449
00:43:33,352 --> 00:43:36,255
Ha presentado una denuncia

450
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:37,855
I'll read quickly.

451
00:44:00,658 --> 00:44:05,439
My name is Maria Cotto and I cleaned Medford High School and McGlynn Middle School for 10 years.

452
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:11,101
I enjoyed my work and was proud to provide a clear and sanitary learning environment for Medford students.

453
00:44:11,701 --> 00:44:17,783
My co-workers and I had fair wages, benefits, and working conditions under a union contract with SEIU 32BJ.

454
00:44:19,163 --> 00:44:31,405
However the district has now awarded its janitorial contract to a new company called Partners Facility Solutions, which is a non-union company that refused to hire me and my co-workers despite several attempts to apply.

455
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:39,687
The union has filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board alleging the partners refusing to hire us because we are part of a union.

456
00:44:40,327 --> 00:44:47,468
The City of Medford should do the right thing and choose a responsible contractor for the next school year that will respect our union and our work.

457
00:44:47,848 --> 00:44:48,128
Thank you.

458
00:44:50,682 --> 00:44:51,142
Thank you.

459
00:44:51,342 --> 00:44:54,243
Is there anything else you'd like to add with your additional time?

460
00:44:55,464 --> 00:44:57,465
I think, I don't think so.

461
00:44:57,565 --> 00:44:59,145
Okay.

462
00:44:59,205 --> 00:45:00,106
Thank you for speaking.

463
00:45:00,126 --> 00:45:03,687
Is there any councilors who'd like to say anything at this time?

464
00:45:07,308 --> 00:45:09,009
Go to Councilor Callahan.

465
00:45:11,815 --> 00:45:16,077
I am very sorry to hear about this.

466
00:45:16,097 --> 00:45:18,578
I want my city to be a pro-union city.

467
00:45:18,598 --> 00:45:21,979
I think the janitorial staff should be union members.

468
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:28,522
So I will certainly do what I can to look into it.

469
00:45:29,786 --> 00:45:30,147
clearly.

470
00:45:31,447 --> 00:45:37,772
City is not the purview of the City Council exactly, but I really appreciate you coming here and bringing your stories.

471
00:45:39,553 --> 00:45:42,635
And it definitely is something that we can have an impact on.

472
00:45:42,695 --> 00:45:44,396
So let's see what we can do.

473
00:45:44,496 --> 00:45:45,156
Thank you, Mr. President.

474
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:46,737
I think that this is alarming because

475
00:45:59,204 --> 00:46:05,529
If not, most of all of our employees that work for the city and our active custodians are all members of the union.

476
00:46:05,549 --> 00:46:20,079
And I think having organized labor, you can see what's happening across the country right now and making sure that our community is supported through labor and making sure that initiatives that come up, it's for the benefit of our community.

477
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:23,002
And that's why we support our union.

478
00:46:23,102 --> 00:46:25,864
So I find this very disturbing.

479
00:46:26,044 --> 00:46:27,045
So I think that this is,

480
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:39,267
You know, everything talks about cost cutting, but having union employees and having our employees represented and protected, I think, speaks volumes.

481
00:46:39,347 --> 00:46:48,133
So, for one, Councilor, if there's something I can do, I will definitely reach out and, you know, see what we can do to support

482
00:46:49,461 --> 00:46:51,422
your organization in moving forward.

483
00:46:52,363 --> 00:46:59,428
If I gather, I know that we've been reaching out to see even with to this non-union company to be hired, they're not even coming, getting back to you.

484
00:46:59,568 --> 00:46:59,968
That's right.

485
00:47:00,249 --> 00:47:01,910
Our members have replied numerous times.

486
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:09,556
In fact, it has occurred there's a charge with the National Labor Relations Board because of their refusal to hire our members, and we believe that's purely because they're union members.

487
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,783
Well, and again, that's what happens now.

488
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:22,044
There's a greedy person at the top.

489
00:47:22,184 --> 00:47:27,268
He's benefiting from the people that are getting their butts kicked every day doing the work.

490
00:47:27,468 --> 00:47:31,670
And I think that's why unions balance that situation.

491
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:36,193
So thank you, Mr. President, but I look forward to working with you to make sure that it's rectified.

492
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:36,494
Thanks.

493
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:37,474
Thank you.

494
00:47:37,594 --> 00:47:38,235
Councilor Lemming.

495
00:47:40,144 --> 00:47:45,329
Yeah, I'd like to echo the sentiments that my colleagues just offered.

496
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:58,601
I'd also just like to encourage you to follow up later so that we can do what we can do behind the scenes and at a council meeting to help out with the situation.

497
00:47:58,621 --> 00:48:02,925
I'm not pleased to hear about this, and thank you for coming out here and speaking.

498
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:12,207
Thank you, yeah, and I will communicate to the superintendent that we heard from you tonight and ask for a response.

499
00:48:12,808 --> 00:48:13,390
Thank you so much.

500
00:48:24,377 --> 00:48:26,578
We're still in public participation.

501
00:48:26,919 --> 00:48:32,782
If you'd like to speak in public participation, you can come to the podium or make a line behind the podium and raise your hand on Zoom.

502
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:35,224
Seeing no hands on Zoom, we'll go to the podium.

503
00:48:35,444 --> 00:48:36,505
Name and address for the record.

504
00:48:36,525 --> 00:48:37,125
You have three minutes.

505
00:48:37,145 --> 00:48:40,647
Sharon Diesso, corner of Circuit Road and Mass Ave in Medford.

506
00:48:43,223 --> 00:48:44,143
Good evening, everyone.

507
00:48:45,024 --> 00:48:46,245
It's nice to see everyone.

508
00:48:46,305 --> 00:48:48,806
What's concerned matters, even in this dire heat.

509
00:48:49,386 --> 00:48:53,528
I just have a quick question for those who may have come in a little late, and I'm a little confused.

510
00:48:54,029 --> 00:49:04,934
Many of us have been following the zoning news, but the public hearing on zoning news at the beginning of tonight's meeting, President Beas, was postponed to September 9th.

511
00:49:05,495 --> 00:49:09,677
Now, the board is meeting, I think, one more time in August and then September 3rd.

512
00:49:10,437 --> 00:49:23,312
So do we have to wait until you like rebuttal with them and then we can participate on comments, wait until September 9, because you have another motion on the agenda this evening regarding zoning.

513
00:49:23,792 --> 00:49:29,499
So when we'll be able to comment ourselves on items that we have reviewed.

514
00:49:30,627 --> 00:49:36,470
Sure, so there are three active zoning amendment proposals currently under consideration.

515
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:39,991
One is the residential districts and ADUs.

516
00:49:40,531 --> 00:49:47,734
That was referred to the Community Development Board in, I want to say March, and they've had several public hearings on it.

517
00:49:48,315 --> 00:49:53,197
Their last public hearing was last week, and they're having another one in early August.

518
00:49:53,917 --> 00:49:56,418
for the residential and ADU proposals.

519
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:02,262
And I believe the comment deadline for the written comment is July 23rd.

520
00:50:02,322 --> 00:50:05,203
That's the deadline that they have set for written comments.

521
00:50:06,344 --> 00:50:11,466
And I believe they have said that on August 5th, they will be deliberating, but they won't be hearing public comment.

522
00:50:11,907 --> 00:50:17,590
And they will be directing the planning consultant to draft a new set of recommendations.

523
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:26,592
Once that's done, they're going to hold further public hearings in September and October before referring recommendations back to the Council.

524
00:50:27,092 --> 00:50:30,593
That's on the residential and the accessory dwelling units proposal.

525
00:50:31,234 --> 00:50:39,136
The proposal that was on our agenda tonight that was delayed till September is a public hearing on Medford Square and West Medford Square zoning.

526
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:54,044
the CD board had a meeting on that proposal, I think the last week of June and maybe discussed it further last week and they have to continue to hold public hearings before making recommendations to the council.

527
00:50:54,524 --> 00:51:02,368
We can't take action until we receive recommendations from the community development board or the community development board chooses not to make a recommendation.

528
00:51:02,868 --> 00:51:04,789
So that's why we had to delay the public hearing.

529
00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:07,391
We don't have recommendations, so we can't take action.

530
00:51:08,011 --> 00:51:23,744
The third proposal is the proposal for what's called other corridors that consists of Broadway, Boston Avenue, High Street, Harvard Street, and Main Street, various kind of mixed-use lots on those streets.

531
00:51:24,885 --> 00:51:31,570
And the CD board has requested that we hold off on referring that to them until at least our August 5th meeting, so that was tabled.

532
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:54,462
Okay so when would the residential be reviewed again because we had the meeting before the last one had one way of thinking and the last one there were many more people who have been informed so I really really urge anyone if they can think of another way besides internet communication for many people who will be affected especially older people

533
00:51:55,002 --> 00:52:07,174
that we need to get some sort of a flyer, besides stuffing it in a tax bill, because that precludes renters, and it also precludes business lessees, you know who don't know that this is going on.

534
00:52:07,275 --> 00:52:07,855
Thanks a lot.

535
00:52:08,296 --> 00:52:08,656
Thank you.

536
00:52:10,658 --> 00:52:16,504
I see a Maria on zoom Maria I'll go to you name and address for the record and you have three minutes.

537
00:52:17,643 --> 00:52:19,643
I just wanted to double check.

538
00:52:19,663 --> 00:52:25,605
Did you say the values aligned local investments ordinance is deferred to September the 9th?

539
00:52:27,285 --> 00:52:31,146
The investments ordinance is tabled to the next regular meeting on August 5th.

540
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:32,486
Thank you.

541
00:52:33,726 --> 00:52:34,166
Thank you.

542
00:52:38,407 --> 00:52:39,608
We'll go back to the podium.

543
00:52:39,648 --> 00:52:40,748
Name and address for the record, please.

544
00:52:40,768 --> 00:52:41,468
You have three minutes.

545
00:52:42,601 --> 00:52:50,847
Roy Belson, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, a longtime member of the Jewish community, and a former employee of the Medford Public Schools for 50 years.

546
00:52:51,707 --> 00:52:58,332
I'm here to speak tonight on the proposed ordinance that you did lay on the table, but I believe I have some words to say that I would like to have heard.

547
00:53:00,373 --> 00:53:02,975
So good evening, Mr. President, members of the council.

548
00:53:04,456 --> 00:53:09,600
The role of city government is to focus on the welfare and betterment of the community.

549
00:53:10,525 --> 00:53:15,408
As individuals, you always have the right to advocate for issues in the international arena.

550
00:53:16,468 --> 00:53:30,536
As a local governmental body representing a diverse community, you need to promote harmony, not create friction and fragmentation over an issue that is not your mandate and well beyond your capacity to significantly influence.

551
00:53:31,556 --> 00:53:33,497
Words carry meaning.

552
00:53:34,198 --> 00:53:40,161
The old saw that sticks and stones may break bones, but words will never harm me is very misleading.

553
00:53:41,042 --> 00:53:43,924
Sometimes words are sharper than a sword.

554
00:53:45,064 --> 00:53:54,689
All you have to do is study social media or be bombarded with campaigns of disinformation to realize that words can lead to severe negative outcomes.

555
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:02,534
To paraphrase, the road to disaster is often paved with good intentions.

556
00:54:03,634 --> 00:54:10,338
Do not let your zeal to advance your ideals blind you to adverse impacts your actions can and will create.

557
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,742
The issues in the Middle East are not just contemporary, but are hundreds of years old.

558
00:54:17,702 --> 00:54:29,325
The causes and circumstances are complex, and the resolution has been defying even the most honorable peace brokers amidst the actions of multiple terrorist groups and partisan fanatics.

559
00:54:30,326 --> 00:54:40,929
You don't have to agree with all of Israeli policies and practices to recognize the Israelis' right to exist, but to recognize the urgent need to eliminate any possibility

560
00:54:41,697 --> 00:54:43,458
of anti-Semitism in our community.

561
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:55,242
Recently, think about the young couple in Washington, Yaron and Sarah, who were gunned down leaving the Israeli embassy by a man screaming, free Palestine.

562
00:54:55,903 --> 00:55:06,667
And 11 days later, think about what happened in Boulder, Colorado, when a man yelling, free Palestine, threw a Molotov cocktail at peaceful marchers calling for the release of hostages.

563
00:55:07,557 --> 00:55:16,541
Think about Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who barely escaped with his family a fire in his home started by another man calling to free Palestine.

564
00:55:17,301 --> 00:55:18,062
I could go on.

565
00:55:19,062 --> 00:55:22,844
Don't think for a moment it couldn't happen here in Medford.

566
00:55:23,584 --> 00:55:27,366
We are as vulnerable as any other Jewish American community.

567
00:55:28,387 --> 00:55:31,708
The proposed ordinances are performative at best.

568
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:35,810
Passage will not alter the international reality.

569
00:55:36,983 --> 00:55:39,425
Any study of BDS has not proven effective.

570
00:55:40,386 --> 00:55:50,575
Massachusetts law and practice makes implementation of such a proposal impractical and not in the best financial interests of the community.

571
00:55:53,618 --> 00:55:56,461
You already passed a resolution in February of this year.

572
00:55:57,502 --> 00:56:03,407
Will you accept accountability if anti-Semitic violence happens in our community?

573
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,105
Don't delude the Palestinian supporters in our community that such an ordinance can even be enforced.

574
00:56:11,085 --> 00:56:15,849
Don't subject the Jewish citizens in our community to a greater threat of hate and violence.

575
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,552
It can happen here.

576
00:56:19,412 --> 00:56:24,356
Instead, demonstrate real leadership by rejecting performative votes.

577
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:32,343
Yes, you can preserve and advance your values and concerns much better by promoting community dialogue,

578
00:56:32,863 --> 00:56:36,568
by bringing citizens together, by promoting understanding.

579
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:40,193
Council business has many challenges and you know it.

580
00:56:40,894 --> 00:56:44,500
Focus on what you can do to better unify the community.

581
00:56:45,241 --> 00:56:46,102
Thank you for listening.

582
00:56:46,863 --> 00:56:47,183
Thank you.

583
00:56:52,104 --> 00:56:55,967
Seeing no hands on zoom will stay at the podium name and address for the record please give three minutes.

584
00:56:56,908 --> 00:56:58,088
Thank you, sir.

585
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:02,031
My name is Mike Cohen, I am you guys hear me okay, we can hear you.

586
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:04,113
Yeah, I live at 200 Brooke Street.

587
00:57:04,914 --> 00:57:10,338
And so I'm here tonight, not as a foreign policy expert because, well, frankly, that's not

588
00:57:11,038 --> 00:57:12,458
what we should be talking about here.

589
00:57:12,478 --> 00:57:19,600
I'm here as a concerned resident, and I'm here because something doesn't sit right and that so called values alignment investment ordinance.

590
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,581
Now it sounds righteous, I get it but it really crosses a lot of moral and civic lines.

591
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:35,703
And let's be honest, you know you guys do a lot and I respect what the city council does, but certainly foreign policy that's not in the city charter, right.

592
00:57:38,585 --> 00:57:43,810
This ordinance, it goes out of its way not to mention Israel, but we know what it really does.

593
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:45,791
It unmistakably targets it.

594
00:57:46,372 --> 00:57:47,693
It's a dramatic overreach.

595
00:57:48,093 --> 00:57:49,294
Worse, it's a distraction.

596
00:57:49,735 --> 00:57:53,878
It's like parks and recreation issuing a position on nuclear disarmament.

597
00:57:54,619 --> 00:57:55,340
What's gonna happen there?

598
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:55,780
Not much.

599
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:56,881
It's not in your lane.

600
00:57:58,903 --> 00:57:59,984
And I don't wanna kid ourselves.

601
00:58:00,124 --> 00:58:03,147
The omission of Israel doesn't make this ordinance more neutral.

602
00:58:03,827 --> 00:58:05,128
It makes it more insidious.

603
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:12,828
It pretends to be about human rights, but it holds one country, that little country that so they do everything wrong.

604
00:58:13,488 --> 00:58:18,452
The only Jewish state, the singular, they hold them to a singular and impossible standard.

605
00:58:18,853 --> 00:58:21,155
And that's not a principled stance, it's a targeted one.

606
00:58:22,656 --> 00:58:24,658
Now we know how antisemitism morphs.

607
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:27,000
If you look at history, it's slippery.

608
00:58:28,164 --> 00:58:30,407
First it was about religion, then race.

609
00:58:31,228 --> 00:58:33,110
Now it's politics and policy.

610
00:58:33,631 --> 00:58:36,835
The justifications change, the target don't.

611
00:58:37,896 --> 00:58:39,939
We see it, we know it, we won't ignore it.

612
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:43,723
And let's not kid ourselves, do not alienate or scapegoat Jewish people.

613
00:58:43,824 --> 00:58:44,785
We won't stand for it.

614
00:58:45,984 --> 00:58:47,425
The ordinance doesn't help anyone.

615
00:58:48,105 --> 00:58:50,386
It doesn't advance peace, it doesn't save lives.

616
00:58:51,206 --> 00:58:55,828
What it does do is single out Israel and by extension Jewish people under the guise of justice.

617
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:59,210
But justice that only applies to one group, that's not justice.

618
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,411
That's biased with the press release.

619
00:59:03,352 --> 00:59:07,854
I know in a lot of circles it's fashionable to be anti-Israel, but it doesn't make it right.

620
00:59:08,741 --> 00:59:21,691
So I urge you all, ladies and gentlemen, please stay focused on your mission, fix what's local, fund what matters, and please don't turn the city into a billboard for a one-sided device foreign policy statement.

621
00:59:22,131 --> 00:59:22,992
Thank you for your time, folks.

622
00:59:23,673 --> 00:59:24,473
Thank you for your comment.

623
00:59:24,513 --> 00:59:31,479
I'm going to go to Zoom.

624
00:59:32,499 --> 00:59:34,081
We have Micah Kesselman on Zoom.

625
00:59:34,361 --> 00:59:36,022
Micah, name and address for the record, please.

626
00:59:36,042 --> 00:59:36,863
You'll have three minutes.

627
00:59:39,113 --> 00:59:39,333
Yeah.

628
00:59:39,353 --> 00:59:39,733
Can you hear me?

629
00:59:40,753 --> 00:59:40,973
Yes.

630
00:59:41,974 --> 00:59:42,274
Great.

631
00:59:42,334 --> 00:59:42,494
Yeah.

632
00:59:42,514 --> 00:59:43,454
My name is Micah Kesselman.

633
00:59:43,474 --> 00:59:44,734
I live at 499 Main Street.

634
00:59:46,535 --> 00:59:53,436
I was not going to make any comments tonight, but I just want to respond to some of the things that have already been said.

635
00:59:53,616 --> 01:00:02,579
Let's understand for everyone here that that is making comments against the ethical investment ordinance or values aligned investment ordinance.

636
01:00:03,439 --> 01:00:04,159
This was brought

637
01:00:05,307 --> 01:00:18,169
to the city council by a cross-section of people who live in Medford from various parts of the community that are concerned about the way that we invest our money and finances.

638
01:00:19,022 --> 01:00:30,965
It is fundamentally about how a city invests the money and how it exercises the controls that it is allowed to under mass general laws.

639
01:00:31,705 --> 01:00:34,085
That is a fundamentally local issue.

640
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:38,486
And not only is it a local issue, it's a local issue that was brought forward by residents of the community.

641
01:00:39,466 --> 01:00:42,687
Nowhere does it say Israel in specific.

642
01:00:43,167 --> 01:00:46,268
It refers to human rights violations,

643
01:00:47,555 --> 01:00:53,158
Myanmar, Saudi Arabia, various other countries which might be found to be under it.

644
01:00:53,859 --> 01:01:03,304
No one is out there saying that it's against Asians or against Saudis or anything like that.

645
01:01:04,364 --> 01:01:10,388
Moreover, I want people to really think about what they're saying when they're implying, imputing

646
01:01:11,537 --> 01:01:18,282
anti-semitism in an ordinance that doesn't even directly attack like go after Israel.

647
01:01:19,482 --> 01:01:28,248
You are equivocating issues with a state to be issues with a people with an ethnicity.

648
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:29,989
That is dangerous.

649
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:33,392
We just saw in the last few days

650
01:01:35,013 --> 01:01:43,339
The Elmo incident on social media where someone hacked the account and was spewing horrible anti-Semitic things.

651
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,181
Notice what they were doing, though.

652
01:01:45,741 --> 01:01:54,248
They were basing that call on that equivocation between Judaism and Israel.

653
01:01:55,857 --> 01:02:16,052
It is dangerous to equivocate the two, and by doing what a lot of you guys are doing, you are feeding into that equivocation narrative, which is dangerous for me and my fellow Jews in the community, and more so that makes me really angry and hard for me to keep it down, is that it makes it dangerous for my son.

654
01:02:16,773 --> 01:02:18,814
for my children and my family.

655
01:02:19,274 --> 01:02:27,978
So stop equivocating anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism or a-Zionism or diasporism.

656
01:02:28,758 --> 01:02:31,579
It's dangerous to all of us.

657
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:34,781
That's it.

658
01:02:36,261 --> 01:02:37,382
Thank you for your comment.

659
01:02:39,443 --> 01:02:40,603
We'll go back to the podium.

660
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:41,884
Name and address for the record, please.

661
01:02:41,904 --> 01:02:42,624
You have three minutes.

662
01:02:43,503 --> 01:02:43,964
Hello, everyone.

663
01:02:44,164 --> 01:02:45,485
My name is Max embarrassing.

664
01:02:45,505 --> 01:02:47,946
I live at 30 review Beach Parkway from Medford.

665
01:02:48,587 --> 01:02:52,630
I'd like to start just by making some personal comments that I like to read out a letter.

666
01:02:54,391 --> 01:02:58,474
For one thing I want to address some of the points that were also recently just made.

667
01:03:00,215 --> 01:03:08,582
A lot of the language that is used within paragraph D of the values ordinance is particularly politically charged.

668
01:03:09,323 --> 01:03:21,553
It's quite provocative, and it is undoubtedly taking advantage of a lot of the things that people might come to mind due to the discourse that is kind of self propagated throughout

669
01:03:22,734 --> 01:03:23,855
online culture nowadays.

670
01:03:24,595 --> 01:03:37,108
A lot of that language that's quite provocative and debatable and often contested includes the words of apartheid genocide ethnic cleansing and everyone gets very riled up when they, when they see these things.

671
01:03:39,288 --> 01:03:41,068
I'd like to make some personal comments.

672
01:03:41,748 --> 01:03:45,449
I'm a homeowner and a taxpaying Medford resident of five years.

673
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:53,871
I'd like to voice my opposition to the inclusion of paragraph D in the Medford values aligned local investment ordinance.

674
01:03:54,431 --> 01:04:06,313
I actually support paragraphs A, B, C, and E, and I think that the majority of people here do, but we cannot beat around the bush of the fact that the language in paragraph D is lifted

675
01:04:06,933 --> 01:04:18,695
quite directly from a lot of the guidelines and narratives pushed by the Boycott, Divest and Sanction movement, and that is undoubtedly targeted at Israel in the use of this language.

676
01:04:19,215 --> 01:04:27,096
And it often hides behind this cloud of ambiguity of, you know, we could apply this to many different nations.

677
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:35,098
And while we can have all of those discussions, it's obviously going to be targeted at Israel at the point of this discussion.

678
01:04:38,002 --> 01:04:47,751
I also don't believe that the language in the particular paragraph that we're discussing particularly to the city of Medford is in the budgetary interests of the city.

679
01:04:48,191 --> 01:04:57,139
A lot of them would involve divesting from companies that are incredibly useful to invest in incredibly profitable some of the most successful companies in America.

680
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,663
being speaking with about some of them.

681
01:05:00,684 --> 01:05:04,930
But I also don't think it agrees with the city's narratives of fairness.

682
01:05:05,531 --> 01:05:13,802
You know, we have these values as Americans that we all want to, you know, support equal justice, equal rights, but a lot of what

683
01:05:14,463 --> 01:05:25,845
people are going to feel as a result is a tangible result of passing this ordinance is going to cause real harm to the Jewish community of Medford and it would create a domino effect to the greater rest of the Commonwealth and to the country.

684
01:05:26,285 --> 01:05:32,826
It is going to make Jewish residents, Israeli residents of Medford and around Massachusetts feel unsafe.

685
01:05:33,566 --> 01:05:41,548
And with that, I'd like to read out loud a letter that was sent to the city council by the American Jewish committee.

686
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:45,890
I urge the city council, unless I don't have the time.

687
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:55,295
Well, ultimately, some of the companies that are listed here are, you know, Apple Nvidia Hewitt Packard Intel, these companies, they

688
01:05:56,407 --> 01:05:57,307
are incredibly useful.

689
01:05:57,727 --> 01:06:09,011
At the same time, if you're going to abstract the language to other countries, there are countries that we also would probably have a lot of trouble divesting from, namely China.

690
01:06:09,291 --> 01:06:13,433
Some of our most successful companies are investing in China.

691
01:06:13,853 --> 01:06:21,796
And those things are simply just not going to be feasible at the city level for us to really divest from.

692
01:06:22,576 --> 01:06:25,457
And it wouldn't be budgetarily effective for the city.

693
01:06:26,097 --> 01:06:31,341
I'll skip on the letter, but I have been aware that it's been delivered to your inboxes.

694
01:06:31,381 --> 01:06:32,462
I do encourage you to read this.

695
01:06:33,103 --> 01:06:33,984
So thank you for your time.

696
01:06:34,784 --> 01:06:35,765
Thank you for your comment.

697
01:06:40,269 --> 01:06:43,371
Thought I saw a hand on Zoom, but it's gone down, so I'll go back to the podium.

698
01:06:43,411 --> 01:06:44,672
Name and address for the record, please.

699
01:06:44,712 --> 01:06:45,333
You have three minutes.

700
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,102
Nick Julio 40 Robinson Road.

701
01:06:48,623 --> 01:06:53,629
So, while I'm glad that we're not going to be taking a vote tonight on the value aligned ordinance.

702
01:06:54,430 --> 01:07:03,342
I do think that decision to table discussion on it was pretty cowardly given there's an obvious presence, people here who are going to speak against it.

703
01:07:04,423 --> 01:07:13,768
applaud the counselor who voted against the motion table as well as moved to take public comment out of order.

704
01:07:13,828 --> 01:07:16,449
So people do have that opportunity to voice their thoughts.

705
01:07:16,969 --> 01:07:22,532
My comments, which I'm going to be discussing, we're assuming that we would be having that discussion tonight.

706
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:25,814
So forgive me if they're a little off and some to some extent, but

707
01:07:26,914 --> 01:07:45,942
I'm very disappointed that, looking at the draft of the ordinance between the last public meeting and this one, that exactly zero changes were made, zero edits, despite extensive public comment at the last meeting from many people, including myself, who were critical of the language.

708
01:07:46,682 --> 01:07:55,446
Speaking just for me, I pointed out that subsection D of section 2-697, that's the part on divesting from human rights abusers,

709
01:07:56,062 --> 01:08:14,734
is very disturbingly vague, and I've yet to receive an answer to the question I asked for the record at the last meeting on this, you know who makes a determination that a company or entity has severely violated, quoting from the ordinances drafted human rights and international humanitarian law as determined by international legal

710
01:08:15,816 --> 01:08:30,849
Humanities bodies, including the United Nations, unquote, maybe it's implied that this would be the treasurer, based on the next section of the draft, but is the treasurer at all qualified to make this determination does she have a degree in international relations does she have a degree.

711
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:34,438
uh, in or is she an international law attorney?

712
01:08:34,578 --> 01:08:45,831
I mean, I call on all of you to ask the treasurer the next discussion to come here and actually provide some information as to will they be qualified at all to make these determinations.

713
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:48,474
The ordinance calls for if the ordinance

714
01:08:49,075 --> 01:08:50,076
or were to be approved.

715
01:08:50,796 --> 01:08:55,960
So since it remains completely unchanged between the last meeting and this one, I have to oppose it in its entirety.

716
01:08:55,980 --> 01:09:00,524
I think the vagueness and the overbreath is just going to open the door to political abuses.

717
01:09:00,824 --> 01:09:05,107
And I definitely agree, this will include targeting based on religious affiliation.

718
01:09:05,548 --> 01:09:11,753
So an absolute minimum, I'd hope the council, when this comes up again, would strike subsection D entirely.

719
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:18,564
If they're not willing to do that, you definitely should not approve this ordinance until that language is made more specific.

720
01:09:19,285 --> 01:09:22,448
I would ask, which companies and entities do you wanna sanction?

721
01:09:22,568 --> 01:09:23,629
Name them explicitly.

722
01:09:24,249 --> 01:09:27,132
If that includes the entire country of Israel, don't hide the ball.

723
01:09:27,792 --> 01:09:35,919
Some of you have made it very clear your legislative intent is to target Israel, but at least own up to that and hear what the public has to say in response.

724
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:36,520
Thank you.

725
01:09:39,162 --> 01:09:39,562
Thank you.

726
01:09:41,817 --> 01:09:45,160
We will go to Zachary Chertok on Zoom.

727
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,922
Zachary, name and address for the record.

728
01:09:46,962 --> 01:09:47,622
You have three minutes.

729
01:09:48,824 --> 01:09:50,625
Zachary Chertok, 5 Almont Street.

730
01:09:52,067 --> 01:10:03,597
I want to echo some of the financial and community concerns as well as the BDS concerns in Section D. I've talked to a lot of folks in the investor VC and PE communities.

731
01:10:05,385 --> 01:10:08,868
that I know professionally and I've worked with both inside and outside the Jewish community.

732
01:10:08,908 --> 01:10:28,224
They have both, they've all emphatically stated that the broad language used in this ordinance, not just in section D, but across the rest of it, will deter them from advising their portfolio companies to come anywhere near Medford in favor of more surrounding communities that don't target very severe restrictive financial measures in this case.

733
01:10:28,985 --> 01:10:33,649
Similarly, I have put in comments and memoranda to the city council as well as the mayor's office

734
01:10:34,392 --> 01:10:43,077
asking for if any financial or legal evaluation has been done as to the risks that this exposes the city to as well as the constraints and have not heard anything definitive back.

735
01:10:45,078 --> 01:11:00,788
External analysis with colleagues out of Columbia SIPA have definitively noted that the broad language in here will basically severely restrict the city's ability to use investments as a non-tax source of revenue, basically rendering one of the only assets available as CDs.

736
01:11:01,581 --> 01:11:08,465
Um, which according to section 55 in the mass general laws is not in the best financial interest of the city, um, towards maximum achievable returns.

737
01:11:09,385 --> 01:11:20,512
Furthermore, I will echo the sentiments, uh, by Mr. Jaleo before me that, um, it's not really definitively clear as to whether the person who is tasked as being responsible with executing this.

738
01:11:21,132 --> 01:11:30,137
Being the treasurer collector that they have the necessary FINRA financial or CPA certifications to be able to execute or provide this kind of financial advisory service.

739
01:11:31,549 --> 01:11:41,494
And I would ask that the language be tightened up significantly and that we see a better updated draft that reflects several of the concerns here tonight, including my own sent to you and now spoken.

740
01:11:41,614 --> 01:11:41,994
Thank you.

741
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:44,636
Thank you.

742
01:11:44,656 --> 01:11:50,058
We'll go back to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

743
01:11:50,118 --> 01:11:50,959
And you'll have three minutes.

744
01:11:51,419 --> 01:11:54,941
Barbara Rutstein, 16 Interrail Avenue, Medford.

745
01:11:58,242 --> 01:11:59,023
I'm scared.

746
01:12:00,527 --> 01:12:02,848
You have made me scared.

747
01:12:05,229 --> 01:12:07,469
I'm not speaking on the resolution.

748
01:12:07,629 --> 01:12:12,331
I'm talking to you as a Jewish person who has been in Medford for over 50 years.

749
01:12:13,071 --> 01:12:17,153
I've served on the Conservation Commission, the Recycling Commission.

750
01:12:17,613 --> 01:12:21,374
I'm a supporter of the library, Chevalier, M-Belt.

751
01:12:22,395 --> 01:12:29,417
I don't, I have just been here for a while and never really been scared

752
01:12:30,702 --> 01:12:31,482
to be Jewish.

753
01:12:33,743 --> 01:12:46,247
But at the Embell picnic this past Saturday, I saw some bumper stickers on one car that was quite upsetting.

754
01:12:47,407 --> 01:12:49,268
And one of them was a trope.

755
01:12:51,152 --> 01:13:04,522
that was used in Germany about Jews ruling the world, but in this case it didn't say Jews ruled the world, it said America is ruled by Zionists.

756
01:13:05,662 --> 01:13:08,865
Now you ask many, many people

757
01:13:09,714 --> 01:13:22,898
and they are probably going to tell you that to them, there's no splitting of hairs or threading the needle, that there's no difference between Zionism and Judaism, Israelis, whatever.

758
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:25,279
So I am scared.

759
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:39,524
Two years ago, through the Jingle Bell Festival, my house was on the house tour because they had never had a house decorated for Hanukkah.

760
01:13:41,128 --> 01:13:49,414
in the years that the Jingle Bell Festival has been in existence and has definitely raised good amounts of money.

761
01:13:49,434 --> 01:14:07,687
But I can tell you today that if I were approached today and asked, do I want to open my house to the general public and support the Jingle Bell Festival by opening up my house to everyone, I would have to say, no, I'm too scared to do that.

762
01:14:09,775 --> 01:14:33,262
So I don't think that those of you who feel that this resolution is something that should be passed in its entirety, the way that it is written, I don't think that you recognize the repercussions because there are not many people who thread that needle about what Zionism is, what Judaism is, who threads that needle.

763
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,281
I am scared.

764
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:40,783
And all politics is local.

765
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:42,744
Tip O'Neill.

766
01:14:45,186 --> 01:14:46,807
And this is what's local to me.

767
01:14:48,788 --> 01:14:49,748
It scares me.

768
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:55,572
The resolution is not going to have an effect on what happens in Gaza.

769
01:14:57,773 --> 01:15:00,315
In some sense, I think it's a lot of grandstanding.

770
01:15:03,845 --> 01:15:10,367
And there have been many of us who have felt, well, you know, people own businesses.

771
01:15:11,327 --> 01:15:18,689
They've held positions of responsibility in the community, just like 1933 in Germany.

772
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:21,230
People own businesses.

773
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:24,351
They have thousands of employees.

774
01:15:26,512 --> 01:15:32,017
but the Jewish component stirs up anti-Semitism.

775
01:15:32,977 --> 01:15:37,521
I don't think that you mean to do that, but it happens.

776
01:15:38,702 --> 01:15:50,332
And it was, again, I'll reference that bumper sticker, on my way to a picnic with my grandchildren at the Brooks Estates last Saturday.

777
01:15:51,656 --> 01:15:53,297
My grandchildren were upset.

778
01:15:54,177 --> 01:15:55,037
I was upset.

779
01:15:55,557 --> 01:16:01,859
There was obviously nothing we could do, but it definitely stirred up that pot.

780
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,401
I don't want to continue to be scared.

781
01:16:08,161 --> 01:16:13,103
So I don't know what your resolution is going to be.

782
01:16:16,183 --> 01:16:24,965
But I am scared, and I think that the proponents of this resolution don't understand the fear that some of us feel.

783
01:16:24,985 --> 01:16:31,707
Thank you for your comment.

784
01:16:32,467 --> 01:16:37,729
I'm gonna go to Maria on Zoom, and then I'll come back to the podium, and then we can go to people who've already spoken once.

785
01:16:39,269 --> 01:16:41,210
Maria, name and address for the record, please.

786
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:41,950
You have three minutes.

787
01:16:47,992 --> 01:16:49,533
Maria, I'm asking you to unmute.

788
01:16:49,993 --> 01:16:50,613
There you go.

789
01:16:52,534 --> 01:16:52,834
OK.

790
01:16:53,514 --> 01:16:56,595
Maria Sullivan, 27 Dudley Street, Medford.

791
01:16:57,355 --> 01:16:57,916
Good evening.

792
01:16:58,796 --> 01:17:02,317
And again, I am also going to talk about the values aligned ordinance.

793
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:04,218
Consider this.

794
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:10,961
If someone in Massachusetts mines granite and uses it to make a countertop for their home, that's fine.

795
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:14,742
If they sell granite to feed their family, good.

796
01:17:15,522 --> 01:17:19,485
If a local person sets up a company and hires workers, that's fine.

797
01:17:20,226 --> 01:17:35,617
If an international company buys land in Massachusetts and hires Massachusetts miners and sells the granite, is it investing in our infrastructure and creating US jobs or is it exploiting our natural resources?

798
01:17:37,239 --> 01:17:40,221
You and the treasurer were not elected to make this decision.

799
01:17:41,371 --> 01:18:04,048
If it were not Massachusetts, but it were a company making widgets, or extracting oil in Ukraine, or Sudan, or Nigeria, or maybe even Hong Kong, or any disputed area which might be deemed illegal occupation, or an apartheid country such as South Africa, there's so much risk and uncertainty.

800
01:18:04,989 --> 01:18:09,132
Don't we want to reward the companies who have the courage to create employment

801
01:18:09,515 --> 01:18:12,998
with decent jobs for the regular people who live there?

802
01:18:14,799 --> 01:18:17,622
You and the treasurer were not elected to make that decision.

803
01:18:19,884 --> 01:18:29,432
If the Medford treasurer simply invests our funds in the S&P 500, that is arguably the 500 most popular stocks in the United States.

804
01:18:30,412 --> 01:18:35,917
Under this proposal, it would be illegal because of Apple, Intel, Samsung, and Caterpillar, plus many others.

805
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:44,019
Those companies have sourced or supplied materials in areas of conflict which have contributed to the named violations.

806
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:57,282
Under the spirit of this proposal, Medford would need to throw away its phones, computers, refrigerators, and lawnmowers, plus track the sources of the fuel used in our trucks and buses.

807
01:18:58,382 --> 01:19:01,223
You and the treasurer were not elected to make these decisions.

808
01:19:02,663 --> 01:19:03,683
How about simply

809
01:19:04,335 --> 01:19:07,757
investing in United States treasury bills or treasury notes.

810
01:19:08,657 --> 01:19:19,002
I can imagine that there are city council members who believe our federal government in the United States commits crimes against humanity and illegal occupation.

811
01:19:20,382 --> 01:19:23,464
You and our treasurer were not elected to make this decision.

812
01:19:24,488 --> 01:19:26,209
Please focus on Medford.

813
01:19:26,549 --> 01:19:28,670
We need fiscal responsibility.

814
01:19:29,571 --> 01:19:31,292
Our world is so complicated.

815
01:19:32,012 --> 01:19:43,078
Medford employees don't have the time or the expertise to decide how to implement section D as in dog of the proposal in accordance with the wishes of the voters.

816
01:19:44,458 --> 01:19:52,763
I heard earlier today that there are 7,000 emails to you on this controversial no-win situation topic.

817
01:19:53,806 --> 01:19:58,008
Please don't handicap our treasurer or burden our treasurer with this.

818
01:19:58,909 --> 01:20:04,552
I move that paragraph D, as in dog, be deleted from this proposal.

819
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:06,013
Do I hear a second?

820
01:20:12,117 --> 01:20:14,558
Thank you for your time and your comment.

821
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:16,399
We'll go back to the podium.

822
01:20:16,899 --> 01:20:18,280
Name and address for the record, please.

823
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,081
You have three minutes.

824
01:20:19,861 --> 01:20:22,643
Rabbi Jessica Dallara, One Hammond Place, Medford.

825
01:20:23,924 --> 01:20:31,226
I am also disappointed that I see no effort has been made to amend the problems with Section D that I and many others pointed out last time.

826
01:20:31,266 --> 01:20:33,266
There's no criteria for determining it.

827
01:20:33,946 --> 01:20:36,567
There's no list of permissible and impermissible companies.

828
01:20:36,607 --> 01:20:40,628
There's no process defined for appeal or review of such designations.

829
01:20:41,028 --> 01:20:49,190
No attempt to allay the concerns that I and my community have brought up about that this will be unevenly applied, primarily or exclusively targeting Israel.

830
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:57,132
I didn't want to be this pedantic, but you didn't even fix the typo that it would be determined by international humanities organizations instead of humanitarian.

831
01:20:57,632 --> 01:21:03,034
What are we going to ask the Modern Language Association, the International Baccalaureate, to decide what we should be investing in?

832
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:15,957
Last time I felt obligated to speak on behalf of those members of my Temple Shalom community who were and continue to be alarmed that enshrining even a vague backdoor BDS into the law of our city has the potential to endanger Jewish residents.

833
01:21:16,517 --> 01:21:33,305
Tonight I speak on behalf of the moderate middle the majority of my congregants who hold tight, the increasingly counter cultural values of nuance and compassion, the thoughtful liberal to progressive politically active congregants who otherwise cheer on much of the work of the city council.

834
01:21:33,965 --> 01:21:40,226
but who will not be goaded into trying to prove we're one of the good Jews by turning our backs on Israel.

835
01:21:40,847 --> 01:21:51,349
I personally, as the rabbi of the only synagogue here in Medford, cannot stand silent to allow a bad ordinance to enshrine disguised anti-Israel posturing into the law of our city.

836
01:21:51,889 --> 01:22:03,292
That obligation as a Jewish leader is independent from my own personal opinions, either about Israel or about the other provisions of this ordinance, many of which I and a majority of my congregants would actually support.

837
01:22:04,172 --> 01:22:25,562
It is not only possible but common in my Temple Shalom community to hold on to the humanity on both sides of the terrible conflict between Israel and Gaza, to weep not only for the remaining 48 hostages still held captive by Hamas, but for all of the suffering and displacement and loss that has plagued Israel and Gaza and the wider region since October 7, 2023.

838
01:22:27,563 --> 01:22:37,165
Those wearing keffiyehs with their kippahs have never had a monopoly on the Jewish value of rachamim, compassion, nor on shalom, a desire for morally acceptable peace.

839
01:22:38,445 --> 01:22:54,568
But this ordinance seeks to shoehorn me and my congregants into a false binary where we either must prove our progressive bona fides by allowing Israel to be targeted here in all but name, or we are officially putting ourselves outside the boundaries of Medford values.

840
01:22:55,228 --> 01:23:05,097
I reject that premise fundamentally, I am pushing back against this ordinance because of my Jewish values and because of my civic values as an American and a Medford homeowner.

841
01:23:05,538 --> 01:23:14,967
This ordinance is badly worded liable to endless and expensive legal challenge, ensure to change nothing on the ground overseas, its main impact will be symbolic.

842
01:23:15,367 --> 01:23:22,173
telling all of us Jews whose opinion of Israel goes anything beyond a reactive and un-nuanced antipathy that we do not belong here.

843
01:23:22,534 --> 01:23:29,059
It erases us from the narrative of our city, just as surely as the name Yisrael has been erased from the text of this measure.

844
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:41,150
Until and unless Section D is removed or substantially amended to allay the concerns that I and my congregants have now repeatedly raised, I must continue to oppose this measure, which does not align with my values.

845
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:41,711
Thank you.

846
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:46,271
Thank you for your comments.

847
01:23:48,094 --> 01:23:50,797
We will go to Zoom.

848
01:23:50,897 --> 01:23:52,279
We have David Lifter.

849
01:23:52,379 --> 01:23:55,063
David, name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

850
01:23:59,584 --> 01:23:59,984
Thank you.

851
01:24:00,004 --> 01:24:01,826
Hi, my name is David Lichter.

852
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:05,029
I'm a Somerville resident, 9 Belmont Place.

853
01:24:05,789 --> 01:24:11,274
I'm here, I wasn't planning on speaking, but I just wanted to, so I don't have prepared remarks.

854
01:24:11,514 --> 01:24:13,356
I just want to give you a flavor.

855
01:24:13,376 --> 01:24:20,682
I'd like to speak in favor of my fellow supporters there in the room who are brave enough to speak out against this resolution.

856
01:24:20,702 --> 01:24:22,123
I want to give you a flavor of what

857
01:24:22,884 --> 01:24:26,227
The practicality of doing this has done in Somerville.

858
01:24:26,767 --> 01:24:33,893
And I want to relay back earlier comments to Mr. Kesselman about speaking about his his child.

859
01:24:34,554 --> 01:24:37,236
I have a daughter in the school system, a young nine year old.

860
01:24:37,496 --> 01:24:44,803
And what we see around Somerville every single day, because we have a BDS measure on our ballot in November.

861
01:24:45,463 --> 01:24:57,486
is harassment, intimidation of community members with chants, public slogans, kathiyas everywhere, storming city hall, trying to intimidate our mayor, our city councillors.

862
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:04,648
And what this often comes from in a very uncivilized and disrespectful way is anti-Israel rhetoric,

863
01:25:05,268 --> 01:25:07,069
which is anti-American.

864
01:25:07,609 --> 01:25:08,829
It's disrespectful.

865
01:25:09,389 --> 01:25:10,650
It's discriminatory.

866
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:16,312
And BDS, by that nature, is promoting narratives of terrorist organizations.

867
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:18,293
It doesn't belong in our community.

868
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:21,354
There are better ways to unite the community than this.

869
01:25:21,754 --> 01:25:28,416
I speak very strongly against this, and I urge the committee to learn from the example going on in Somerville.

870
01:25:28,436 --> 01:25:31,437
We're just down the road, and we see this hate every single day.

871
01:25:31,537 --> 01:25:32,358
Thank you for your time.

872
01:25:32,398 --> 01:25:33,118
I appreciate it.

873
01:25:39,116 --> 01:25:39,876
Thank you for your comment.

874
01:25:39,916 --> 01:25:41,056
We'll go back to the podium.

875
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:42,417
Name and address for the record, please.

876
01:25:42,457 --> 01:25:43,217
You have three minutes.

877
01:25:45,217 --> 01:25:46,518
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

878
01:25:46,538 --> 01:25:48,378
Gaston Fury 61, Stigney Road.

879
01:25:48,438 --> 01:25:52,039
So I oppose this so-called values-aligned investment audience.

880
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:54,940
I spoke against it last time, so I'm not going to repeat myself.

881
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,080
I'm just going to ask a few questions about what happened.

882
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,941
So the first one is that

883
01:26:01,141 --> 01:26:02,442
Paragraph D was mentioned.

884
01:26:02,802 --> 01:26:08,826
I also mentioned Paragraph C because it says any companies that derive any of its revenue, that's even $1.

885
01:26:09,046 --> 01:26:12,348
Do we like weather satellites or we don't want any more weather satellites?

886
01:26:12,428 --> 01:26:16,210
Because we're not going to be able to invest in any companies that, for example, manufacture weather satellites.

887
01:26:16,651 --> 01:26:18,292
And as some other people have mentioned,

888
01:26:19,092 --> 01:26:32,565
even companies that produce applications or the electronics that we use on a daily basis would fall under this category as well because it's even $1 that they get out of weapons of any kind, including defense contractors, then we can invest.

889
01:26:33,065 --> 01:26:39,411
So this is against our national security, the US national security.

890
01:26:41,633 --> 01:26:46,216
it's also against our finances, which after all is taxpayers money.

891
01:26:46,716 --> 01:26:52,520
So I also would like to point out that there have been no change in this audience since last time to this time.

892
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,521
So it goes postpone again.

893
01:26:54,621 --> 01:26:59,104
So I'm sure you know, everyone here, we make an effort, we love coming here, we do.

894
01:26:59,544 --> 01:27:04,407
But it's also like, you know, it's a little bit taxing, like tomorrow, we have to come again, because we have to discuss zoning.

895
01:27:04,808 --> 01:27:06,189
So um, you know, I

896
01:27:06,949 --> 01:27:14,074
I'm just a little bit frustrated that things get put in the agenda and then they get postponed to September or to some future meeting that we have no idea about.

897
01:27:14,735 --> 01:27:16,036
So I would like that to end.

898
01:27:17,917 --> 01:27:22,521
And I would also like to mention that, you know, so

899
01:27:23,994 --> 01:27:30,162
I'm a little bit, I'm not sure about this resident support of this, as was mentioned earlier.

900
01:27:31,044 --> 01:27:35,510
So I would like to remind everyone that we live in a democratic system, at least up to now.

901
01:27:35,570 --> 01:27:39,956
And then, you know, so people get elected, and they need to work for all of the city.

902
01:27:40,116 --> 01:27:47,921
not a special interest group, not a very small proportion, and in the best case scenario for all of us, and in the worst case scenario for the people that have voted for some of you.

903
01:27:48,001 --> 01:27:58,649
And I remind that participation in local elections covers around 30%, and then no one gets 100% or 30%, which means that overall, the people that have voted for you, it's like probably around a quarter.

904
01:27:59,229 --> 01:28:04,533
And I can't imagine that a quarter of those, if all of those people actually support this kind of voting.

905
01:28:04,553 --> 01:28:07,335
And so, I just feel that,

906
01:28:08,196 --> 01:28:12,057
we need to do a little bit of a better job at sort of listening to the whole city.

907
01:28:12,077 --> 01:28:16,279
What has happened to all the comments that were heard last time, my comment included, and everyone else's.

908
01:28:16,539 --> 01:28:18,600
The comments today, the comments that are going to happen next week.

909
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,061
Is the audience still going to look the same, or is it going to change?

910
01:28:21,161 --> 01:28:24,002
Is someone going to address what we're saying, or nothing is going to change?

911
01:28:24,262 --> 01:28:29,003
Because otherwise, you should just tell us, like, you know, high-quality participation, and then just pass whatever you want to pass.

912
01:28:30,264 --> 01:28:31,644
And then it would have the same effect.

913
01:28:31,904 --> 01:28:35,386
So thank you so much for listening.

914
01:28:35,406 --> 01:28:36,226
Thank you for your comment.

915
01:28:37,032 --> 01:28:38,353
We'll go to Zoom.

916
01:28:38,533 --> 01:28:40,253
I see PBB on Zoom.

917
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:42,855
I'll unmute you and you'll have three minutes.

918
01:28:43,135 --> 01:28:44,855
Name and address for the record, please.

919
01:28:47,637 --> 01:28:48,997
Oh, we can't hear you.

920
01:28:49,538 --> 01:28:50,918
Let me request an unmute again.

921
01:28:50,938 --> 01:28:52,119
Okay, got it.

922
01:28:52,139 --> 01:28:53,279
There you go.

923
01:28:53,479 --> 01:28:54,260
Name and address the record.

924
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:54,980
You have three minutes.

925
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,901
Patricia Brady, Dougherty, 190 High Street, Medford.

926
01:28:58,201 --> 01:29:01,083
I turned this on to watch what was going to happen to the rezoning.

927
01:29:02,043 --> 01:29:03,244
Instead, I'm watching this.

928
01:29:04,324 --> 01:29:05,244
It's so horrible.

929
01:29:05,264 --> 01:29:06,185
This is horrifying.

930
01:29:07,202 --> 01:29:18,568
To think that you have put longtime senior citizen residents, actually of all ages, at risk, and to think they feel the need to come up and say to you, I'm afraid.

931
01:29:18,808 --> 01:29:23,591
For Barbara Rutstein to have to come up here and tell you that is horrifying.

932
01:29:23,851 --> 01:29:26,673
This is so embarrassing for the city of Medford.

933
01:29:28,094 --> 01:29:30,415
You shouldn't be laying this on the table.

934
01:29:30,455 --> 01:29:31,956
You shouldn't be continuing this.

935
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:38,143
You should be having a motion tonight to end it tonight.

936
01:29:39,484 --> 01:29:41,025
You people ought to be embarrassed.

937
01:29:42,226 --> 01:29:42,626
Thank you.

938
01:29:49,691 --> 01:29:50,131
Thank you.

939
01:29:50,191 --> 01:29:54,274
We'll return to the podium, but I want to get folks who haven't had a chance to speak yet, Sharon.

940
01:29:54,394 --> 01:29:58,717
So I'm going to go, sorry, did you speak during public participation?

941
01:30:00,651 --> 01:30:01,232
on the zoning?

942
01:30:01,752 --> 01:30:02,432
No, you didn't Melanie.

943
01:30:02,452 --> 01:30:03,253
So we'll take you first.

944
01:30:03,513 --> 01:30:03,934
Thank you.

945
01:30:05,695 --> 01:30:07,416
Yeah, no, I know you hadn't spoken yet.

946
01:30:07,637 --> 01:30:09,618
Give me one second to reset the timer.

947
01:30:10,379 --> 01:30:14,982
And then for anyone who's already had a chance to speak, we'll come back around to you for one more minute if you'd like.

948
01:30:17,204 --> 01:30:18,285
Name and address for the record, please.

949
01:30:18,575 --> 01:30:20,757
Melanie Tringali, 116 Forest Street.

950
01:30:21,938 --> 01:30:23,739
I wasn't going to comment tonight on this at all.

951
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:30,424
My original comment was about this ordinance and the council's fiduciary responsibility to the city of Medford.

952
01:30:30,965 --> 01:30:39,171
It's your fiduciary responsibility who oversees the budget to make sure that we have right investments and bring us a good return on our money.

953
01:30:39,271 --> 01:30:43,694
But then listening to these stories and these people who are afraid and upset

954
01:30:44,974 --> 01:30:56,122
The gentleman from Somerville who called in talking about the hate that he's witnessing in Somerville and what's happening over there should be enough for you people to make these changes to these ordinances.

955
01:30:56,843 --> 01:31:06,169
I mean, other than the fiduciary responsibility to the city of Medford and its residents, but also for all these other residents who don't support this at all and are afraid.

956
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:10,352
I really would recommend that you reconsider it altogether.

957
01:31:10,512 --> 01:31:10,873
Thank you.

958
01:31:11,993 --> 01:31:12,354
Thank you.

959
01:31:15,432 --> 01:31:21,857
All right, seeing no new hands on Zoom, we'll stay at the podium for folks who haven't had a chance to speak yet.

960
01:31:23,017 --> 01:31:24,979
Name and address for the record and you'll have three minutes.

961
01:31:27,713 --> 01:31:28,414
Good evening, council.

962
01:31:28,454 --> 01:31:29,695
My name is Judy Beatrice.

963
01:31:30,175 --> 01:31:32,397
I'm chairman of the Commissioners Trust Funds.

964
01:31:32,957 --> 01:31:36,500
We manage and I do share responsibility to invest such funds.

965
01:31:37,141 --> 01:31:42,124
I'm here to say that this particular document, I have looked hard.

966
01:31:42,645 --> 01:31:46,448
It looks to me like it was rewritten from one of the Boston documents on divestment.

967
01:31:46,888 --> 01:31:50,951
And I did notice when I was going through the Boston, I said it does not apply to Boston.

968
01:31:51,752 --> 01:31:53,694
My mate, there's enough people talking here about it.

969
01:31:53,754 --> 01:32:04,584
My concern and from my point of view of manager and we have the fiduciary responsibility for all the trust funds is the fact it says no public funds, no public funds, no public funds and no public funds.

970
01:32:05,545 --> 01:32:09,749
The only public funds that I know currently that exist in the city are tax receipts,

971
01:32:10,555 --> 01:32:13,456
If you've got the Inflation Reduction Act, you have money from me, that's a grant.

972
01:32:13,636 --> 01:32:14,817
Those are public funds.

973
01:32:15,497 --> 01:32:23,661
The funds that we manage or that your pension fund manage, they are not public funds by statute, by Massachusetts statute and by ours.

974
01:32:24,242 --> 01:32:32,846
So I think there really needs to be some serious consideration about the verbiage of this particular bill that it really doesn't really match, I think, what you're trying to accomplish.

975
01:32:33,206 --> 01:32:39,809
It will cause, well, I can tell you very frankly, the commissioners, we will disagree with the fact that our funds are public, they are not.

976
01:32:40,249 --> 01:32:43,591
we operate under fiduciary rules and therefore, and the Prudent Investment Act.

977
01:32:43,911 --> 01:33:02,842
And we have managed the fund appropriately to make sure that there are funds available as given by the various trusts that we operate for the benefit of whom they wanted to be beneficiaries of those funds, including and not unlimited to the perpetual care of the cemetery, which goes into your budget to the tune of 200,000 plus every single year by our management.

978
01:33:03,222 --> 01:33:06,804
And by having taken over that fund years ago and straightening it out,

979
01:33:07,364 --> 01:33:10,945
Formerly, when I first was on this committee, it was all invested in bonds.

980
01:33:11,745 --> 01:33:16,387
And in bonds, it was great because if you bought a bond in 1986, they were paying 10, 12, 13%.

981
01:33:16,787 --> 01:33:20,808
Well, guess what happened when they all came through 30 years later?

982
01:33:21,488 --> 01:33:22,348
They were worth nothing.

983
01:33:22,768 --> 01:33:32,491
And unfortunately, that fund, which was supposed to take care of perpetual care and your budget, was down to nothing when we took it over because there were no 15, 20% bonds out there.

984
01:33:32,931 --> 01:33:34,632
So it was a process of investing.

985
01:33:35,310 --> 01:33:43,184
So I think you really need to have some serious, I'm very happy to be available to you and go through this as to what is needed, but you need to have a serious consideration.

986
01:33:43,545 --> 01:33:47,552
Now I did recall the other night that somebody mentioned the main divestment.

987
01:33:47,892 --> 01:33:48,653
I went and looked it up.

988
01:33:49,642 --> 01:33:55,805
The main divestment ordinance, and I read it very carefully, it doesn't sound like this at all.

989
01:33:56,225 --> 01:34:02,567
In fact, it makes a very specific, and they mean it, they're talking specifically in this case about the retirement pension funds.

990
01:34:03,048 --> 01:34:13,312
And they make the point very clearly that in the process of doing it, that they measure time, benefit, risk, in terms of the process of how they unwind and what they do.

991
01:34:14,092 --> 01:34:21,154
Now, you may not realize that most of the time these ESG funds have been invested by private equity, because your average fund can't do that.

992
01:34:21,594 --> 01:34:23,875
Private equity funds are very risky.

993
01:34:24,055 --> 01:34:27,676
They have what we call a J curve, which means, oh, think of the steward hospitals.

994
01:34:27,696 --> 01:34:29,436
That's another example of a private equity.

995
01:34:29,816 --> 01:34:35,498
So when you first invest, they collect money from other people, and they invest it in, hopefully, in things that will return an investment.

996
01:34:35,918 --> 01:34:43,106
The J curb goes down which means it's not making any money and you have to wait for the tail to come back up to make it and then they throw all the money out.

997
01:34:43,527 --> 01:34:53,878
So it was really clear from reading the main the main divestment that they were waiting because they had to wait because they did equity investments they were still waiting till 28 to unwind that.

998
01:34:54,579 --> 01:34:55,580
We as commissioners

999
01:34:56,487 --> 01:35:10,922
And with our investment managers, we make decisions every single quarter, sometimes more often, particularly in 220 and 221 and 222, because of the needs to adjust what you need for your budget, what our trusts need for their trust, what they're going to distribute money for.

1000
01:35:11,423 --> 01:35:12,504
We make those decisions.

1001
01:35:13,004 --> 01:35:14,066
We are not a public fund.

1002
01:35:15,368 --> 01:35:20,376
I do believe you need to reconsider the verbiage of this and not have any, there is problems with the verbiage in this.

1003
01:35:20,436 --> 01:35:25,163
I think we need to have a table so we have, and I'm very happy to talk with any of you at any time, as are my members.

1004
01:35:25,423 --> 01:35:26,105
Thank you very much.

1005
01:35:26,385 --> 01:35:28,488
Thanks Judy, just if I could for one second.

1006
01:35:30,436 --> 01:35:35,180
I've been trying to meet with you through the administration for several months, and I didn't get connected.

1007
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:35,921
I work for the city.

1008
01:35:35,961 --> 01:35:36,321
I'm sorry.

1009
01:35:36,501 --> 01:35:36,722
I know.

1010
01:35:36,962 --> 01:35:37,763
But that's why I sent it.

1011
01:35:37,783 --> 01:35:38,683
But feel free to call me.

1012
01:35:38,723 --> 01:35:39,384
Yes, I don't.

1013
01:35:39,544 --> 01:35:40,425
I didn't get the message.

1014
01:35:40,525 --> 01:35:45,309
I spoke with Judy today, Judy Johnston, and we're going to set up a meeting with you to talk about something.

1015
01:35:45,329 --> 01:35:45,970
Thank you very much.

1016
01:35:46,030 --> 01:35:46,650
I appreciate that.

1017
01:35:46,671 --> 01:35:46,951
Thank you.

1018
01:35:47,031 --> 01:35:54,798
Is there anyone who hasn't had a chance to speak yet who would like to speak in public participation?

1019
01:35:59,083 --> 01:36:02,047
going to go to Zoom and then I'll come back to the podium.

1020
01:36:02,688 --> 01:36:06,013
You've raised your hands at the same well, period at the same time.

1021
01:36:06,754 --> 01:36:09,217
Going to go to Meryl Pearlson, name and address for the record, please.

1022
01:36:09,237 --> 01:36:09,999
You have three minutes.

1023
01:36:12,738 --> 01:36:16,783
Hi, I'm Merrill Carlson I live at 97 be Boston Avenue.

1024
01:36:17,443 --> 01:36:33,162
I actually did not prepare to speak on this tonight I too was coming to just hear what was going on with the zoning amendments and, but I feel compelled to speak about the values aligned ordinance.

1025
01:36:34,222 --> 01:36:37,623
and which I just hurriedly referenced and read through.

1026
01:36:37,783 --> 01:36:51,948
And let's not kid ourselves about paragraph D. The language in there is clearly intended as dog whistle words copied directly from BDS organizations that have been at least honestly more explicit about their anti-Israel agenda.

1027
01:36:53,428 --> 01:36:58,210
Hearing that there's been no change since the last public discussion on this is disheartening.

1028
01:36:59,850 --> 01:37:09,212
Mr. Kesselman expressed that those arguments, those arguing against the ordinance are perpetuating a false equivalency between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism.

1029
01:37:09,292 --> 01:37:17,233
But this equivalency is something that every Jewish person, including myself, lives with every day, regardless of our political stances.

1030
01:37:17,734 --> 01:37:18,894
It's been thrust on us.

1031
01:37:19,934 --> 01:37:24,855
And please know also that as a parent, I greatly sympathize with your fears, with your concerns.

1032
01:37:24,895 --> 01:37:25,295
In fact,

1033
01:37:26,436 --> 01:37:39,054
When my son went through Medford public schools with several members on this council, he experienced anti semitism, and I don't want us to kid ourselves that it can't happen here.

1034
01:37:39,074 --> 01:37:39,154
So I.

1035
01:37:42,198 --> 01:37:45,780
and I also am aware of many recent incidents in other communities.

1036
01:37:46,681 --> 01:37:56,968
Aside from the disguised agenda, the vagary of the language is clearly problematic as we're hearing from people who have expertise in finance and investment.

1037
01:37:57,688 --> 01:38:08,195
And mostly I just want to say that I think there's so much great going on in Medford and I think there's also a lot of needs that Medford has to have addressed and this

1038
01:38:09,294 --> 01:38:18,216
just seems like it is coming from an external agenda that maybe we need to take care of more business at home first.

1039
01:38:18,376 --> 01:38:21,316
So thank you for allowing my impromptu remarks.

1040
01:38:23,737 --> 01:38:24,677
Thank you for your comment.

1041
01:38:24,697 --> 01:38:31,258
I'm going to go back to the podium for anyone who hasn't had a chance to speak yet.

1042
01:38:31,779 --> 01:38:33,059
Name and address for the record, please.

1043
01:38:33,099 --> 01:38:33,819
You have three minutes.

1044
01:38:35,234 --> 01:38:36,976
Name Aaron, 373 Riverside Ave.

1045
01:38:37,816 --> 01:38:42,460
I too am disappointed that you're actually not taking like actual comments for this tonight.

1046
01:38:43,161 --> 01:38:46,043
I know this is public comment period, but it is kind of cowardly.

1047
01:38:46,063 --> 01:38:46,924
So I'm gonna second that.

1048
01:38:47,465 --> 01:38:52,249
This ordinance does not align to my values as a citizen for a number of reasons.

1049
01:38:52,829 --> 01:39:00,676
So I'm sorry if that bores you all and you've heard it all before, but it's more than just subsection D. This is a trash ordinance.

1050
01:39:01,317 --> 01:39:02,638
And again, you've divided the city.

1051
01:39:03,730 --> 01:39:05,391
This whole thing should just be tossed out.

1052
01:39:06,171 --> 01:39:15,514
You have a counselor here who's in the Navy, and I don't understand why defense contractors that make defensive weapons are bad.

1053
01:39:16,074 --> 01:39:18,195
Is it because the military who uses them?

1054
01:39:18,795 --> 01:39:21,356
Is it the fact that we don't defend ourselves with bubbles?

1055
01:39:22,676 --> 01:39:23,417
I don't understand.

1056
01:39:24,077 --> 01:39:29,559
Do you not invest in DJI, which is a drone company, because those can be used as offensive weapons?

1057
01:39:30,139 --> 01:39:32,720
There's a company called Raytheon that some of you may have heard of.

1058
01:39:33,635 --> 01:39:38,576
They have offshoots in Cambridge, so that's kind of a local company, as well as North Andover.

1059
01:39:38,616 --> 01:39:40,257
In fact, they pay for the schools there.

1060
01:39:41,217 --> 01:39:43,658
Does everyone who works at Raytheon, are they a baby killer?

1061
01:39:44,858 --> 01:39:49,959
Most of you weren't alive in the 70s when folks like my dad were coming home from Vietnam.

1062
01:39:50,599 --> 01:39:54,680
He didn't want to go to that war, but he was spit on and called a baby killer.

1063
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:55,381
He was a medic.

1064
01:39:56,261 --> 01:39:57,121
He saved lives.

1065
01:39:58,281 --> 01:40:00,742
You don't know the consequences of what you're writing in here.

1066
01:40:01,583 --> 01:40:11,726
And if your values are so hard up on that and it's because this government for whatever reason does anything offensive and not strictly defensive, I don't know.

1067
01:40:12,027 --> 01:40:13,507
I mean, put your money where your mouth is.

1068
01:40:13,627 --> 01:40:19,429
Maybe one of the councilors should resign his commission then if he really feels that strongly about this and that's his values.

1069
01:40:20,649 --> 01:40:29,132
This whole thing is not the values of the city, just a subset, a select few of you that decided to take this up and divide the city.

1070
01:40:29,672 --> 01:40:30,953
Congrats, it's still working.

1071
01:40:34,183 --> 01:40:35,183
Thank you for your comment.

1072
01:40:36,124 --> 01:40:37,485
We're gonna go back to Zoom.

1073
01:40:37,545 --> 01:40:38,665
We have been near Germanus.

1074
01:40:39,125 --> 01:40:40,486
Name and address for the record, please.

1075
01:40:40,526 --> 01:40:41,266
You have three minutes.

1076
01:40:44,208 --> 01:40:46,289
Hi, excuse me, it's taking me a bit to unmute.

1077
01:40:46,309 --> 01:40:51,011
I'm not sure I agree with some of the comments that I'm hearing.

1078
01:41:00,693 --> 01:41:03,974
This ordinance does indeed reflect our values.

1079
01:41:05,175 --> 01:41:21,181
And if somebody is nitpicking about one part of the ordinance that happens to, in their mind, apply to a specific state, that is something else.

1080
01:41:22,001 --> 01:41:23,542
This applies to any state.

1081
01:41:25,138 --> 01:41:34,324
And the values that are reflected in all the parts of this ordinance are indeed values to be commended.

1082
01:41:35,665 --> 01:41:53,098
And we should not necessarily just follow the leads of a government that just happens to make decisions that are based on how much money they're gonna make out of the weapon manufacturers.

1083
01:41:53,858 --> 01:41:54,258
Okay?

1084
01:41:55,579 --> 01:42:15,164
It's a fact, and you've heard it in the news, that even some of our elected officials are making money investing in these weapon-producing companies, okay, based on the playing around of the stock market that's happening.

1085
01:42:15,945 --> 01:42:20,206
I mean, come on, see the light and act upon it.

1086
01:42:20,626 --> 01:42:20,946
Thank you.

1087
01:42:23,527 --> 01:42:24,427
Thank you for your comment.

1088
01:42:25,748 --> 01:42:30,111
Is there anyone who hasn't had a chance to speak yet who would like to speak either in person or on Zoom?

1089
01:42:31,131 --> 01:42:33,613
I see Mr. Castanetti.

1090
01:42:33,673 --> 01:42:35,013
Name and address for the record, please.

1091
01:42:35,033 --> 01:42:39,516
You'll have three minutes, and then we'll go back to... One second, Andy.

1092
01:42:39,536 --> 01:42:40,536
I gotta turn on your microphone.

1093
01:42:41,077 --> 01:42:41,597
Yes, sir.

1094
01:42:42,377 --> 01:42:42,658
Go ahead.

1095
01:42:44,058 --> 01:42:44,539
Yes, sir.

1096
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:50,622
Being of Castanetti, Andrew, Ace, Medford.

1097
01:42:51,877 --> 01:42:57,240
being of Ginju blood since 1492, yeah, and Columbus too, by the way.

1098
01:42:59,522 --> 01:43:03,744
I wanna quote the Bible, Genesis chapter 12, verse three.

1099
01:43:03,944 --> 01:43:09,507
Whether you believe in God and the Bible or not, I must quote these verses.

1100
01:43:12,869 --> 01:43:14,831
I will bless thee who blesses thee.

1101
01:43:16,231 --> 01:43:18,753
I will curse he, her, or it.

1102
01:43:19,687 --> 01:43:20,607
who curses thee."

1103
01:43:21,027 --> 01:43:25,348
The translation is, if you go against the Jews, you will perish.

1104
01:43:28,309 --> 01:43:32,789
By the way, I'm afraid history is repeating itself.

1105
01:43:35,450 --> 01:43:47,752
Mr. Bloomberg, Sr., believed in the 40s, bought a house in West Medford, but he was not allowed, as a Jew,

1106
01:43:48,698 --> 01:43:50,338
and how to use a strong name.

1107
01:43:52,339 --> 01:43:53,739
Are we repeating history?

1108
01:43:54,279 --> 01:43:55,279
This is insanity.

1109
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:56,400
Be nice.

1110
01:43:58,180 --> 01:43:59,220
Thank you for your comment.

1111
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:04,061
I'm going to go to Eileen Lerner on Zoom.

1112
01:44:04,081 --> 01:44:05,922
Eileen, name and address for the record.

1113
01:44:05,962 --> 01:44:06,862
You have three minutes.

1114
01:44:11,743 --> 01:44:16,184
I am a Jew.

1115
01:44:20,047 --> 01:44:21,230
I love my people.

1116
01:44:22,553 --> 01:44:23,856
I love Judaism.

1117
01:44:23,876 --> 01:44:25,560
I love the culture.

1118
01:44:27,490 --> 01:44:29,111
but I am for this ordinance.

1119
01:44:29,792 --> 01:44:33,155
I feel it reflects the Jewish values that I was taught.

1120
01:44:33,975 --> 01:44:35,337
I want a peaceful world.

1121
01:44:36,277 --> 01:44:42,122
I don't want a world where children are being torn apart by bombs every day.

1122
01:44:42,242 --> 01:44:47,607
I don't want a world where people are starved to death and we have to stand by and watch it.

1123
01:44:47,847 --> 01:44:48,588
I'm sorry.

1124
01:44:48,708 --> 01:44:55,133
I don't want a world where crazy people can get guns and come into schools and kill.

1125
01:44:56,034 --> 01:45:02,236
kids and go into supermarkets and go to music performances and kill people.

1126
01:45:02,436 --> 01:45:03,937
I mean, we have a death culture.

1127
01:45:03,977 --> 01:45:08,838
And if we keep going on the way we're going, we're just going to blow up the world inevitably.

1128
01:45:08,858 --> 01:45:14,420
To me, this this is a reflection of the desire for peace in the world.

1129
01:45:15,472 --> 01:45:16,813
for peace everywhere.

1130
01:45:16,833 --> 01:45:22,375
I mean, look what's happening in the Sudan and in Congo and in other places around the world.

1131
01:45:22,435 --> 01:45:30,159
And we have our hand in it because it's our tax money that's paying for a lot of these weapons.

1132
01:45:31,019 --> 01:45:32,680
And I just want to congratulate

1133
01:45:35,128 --> 01:45:41,534
Jason, who brought this forth, and Zach, and the city council for even considering it.

1134
01:45:42,214 --> 01:45:45,177
And it definitely is not anti-Semitic.

1135
01:45:45,838 --> 01:45:47,179
It's anti-war.

1136
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:50,322
It's anti-killing people.

1137
01:45:50,502 --> 01:45:52,243
It's anti-starvation.

1138
01:45:53,444 --> 01:45:54,665
That's what it's about.

1139
01:45:56,287 --> 01:45:56,767
Thank you.

1140
01:45:58,689 --> 01:45:59,590
Thank you for your comment.

1141
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:06,302
Is there anyone who has not spoken yet in the chamber who would like to speak?

1142
01:46:08,603 --> 01:46:12,884
Seeing none, I'm going to go to Josh Eckart Lee on Zoom.

1143
01:46:12,945 --> 01:46:16,386
Josh, name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

1144
01:46:17,940 --> 01:46:19,861
Thank you, President Behrs.

1145
01:46:20,241 --> 01:46:24,243
I urge you all to vote favorably on this.

1146
01:46:24,824 --> 01:46:30,527
As I said at the last hearing, I drastically live on Main Street.

1147
01:46:31,207 --> 01:46:34,489
I also serve on the city's Energy Environment Committee.

1148
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:44,435
The committee sent a letter to this body strongly urging you to be in favor of fossil fuel divestment.

1149
01:46:45,175 --> 01:46:52,361
And I also as a resident urge you to be in favor of this ordinance that does divest us from the fossil fuel industry.

1150
01:46:52,941 --> 01:47:04,490
As the previous speaker said, the fossil fuel industry and these investments in destructive industries are not in line with our values, and we really commend the City Council for

1151
01:47:05,611 --> 01:47:14,522
Bringing what power they can to the finances that we have in destructive industries, like some of our portfolio in Chevron.

1152
01:47:14,582 --> 01:47:21,851
And I'm really grateful that this is being considered and want to recognize the interrelations between

1153
01:47:22,512 --> 01:47:31,242
the climate crisis that we face and the way that it exacerbates conflict around the world, that it drives people into prisons and other detention centers.

1154
01:47:31,542 --> 01:47:37,749
And of course, all of that gets multiplied as impunity for human rights violations goes.

1155
01:47:38,890 --> 01:47:39,450
unpunished.

1156
01:47:39,570 --> 01:47:45,853
And so we really commend City Council for recognizing the interrelation between these various social harms.

1157
01:47:45,973 --> 01:47:52,695
And I'm grateful to see you all acting and investing in our futures and investing in alignment with our values.

1158
01:47:52,935 --> 01:47:53,295
Thank you.

1159
01:47:55,076 --> 01:47:56,016
Thank you for your comments.

1160
01:47:56,036 --> 01:48:01,298
I'm going to stay on Zoom unless there's anyone who hasn't spoken yet who'd like to speak in person.

1161
01:48:03,037 --> 01:48:06,080
Seeing none, I'm going to go to Dina on Zoom.

1162
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:07,901
Dina, name and address for the record, please.

1163
01:48:07,941 --> 01:48:08,762
You'll have three minutes.

1164
01:48:10,864 --> 01:48:14,867
Hi, I'm Dina at 3780 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford.

1165
01:48:16,467 --> 01:48:24,813
Thank you, President Behrs and for the city councilor for giving us this opportunity to speak on this and bringing this ordinance forward.

1166
01:48:25,093 --> 01:48:26,834
I encourage you all to support this.

1167
01:48:27,935 --> 01:48:31,397
I've spoken multiple times, but for me, this is very personal.

1168
01:48:33,159 --> 01:48:40,744
We've heard from many other people in terms of divesting from fossil fuels and prisons and weapons manufacturers.

1169
01:48:40,784 --> 01:48:43,786
But for me personally, as a Palestinian who has family in Gaza,

1170
01:48:45,427 --> 01:48:53,293
it's really important that we invest our city money in not killing my family members.

1171
01:48:55,455 --> 01:49:02,180
And it shouldn't be controversial to say that we don't want our tax dollars to harm human life.

1172
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:10,426
So I just, again, I encourage you all to think about how this impacts human life.

1173
01:49:12,107 --> 01:49:12,728
Thank you so much.

1174
01:49:14,672 --> 01:49:15,652
Thank you for your comment.

1175
01:49:18,614 --> 01:49:22,815
Is there anyone in person who'd like to speak for a second time for a minute?

1176
01:49:23,415 --> 01:49:25,716
And I see two hands of people who've already spoken as well.

1177
01:49:26,217 --> 01:49:27,277
So we'll go to the podium.

1178
01:49:27,497 --> 01:49:28,457
You'll have one more minute.

1179
01:49:29,138 --> 01:49:30,418
Name and address for the record, please.

1180
01:49:30,758 --> 01:49:33,780
Sharon Diesso, corner of Mass Ave and Circuit Road.

1181
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:35,500
Long time resident.

1182
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:36,441
Thank you.

1183
01:49:36,481 --> 01:49:37,341
I'll make this brief.

1184
01:49:38,621 --> 01:49:42,363
Does anyone here want to present a strong definition of BDS?

1185
01:49:44,081 --> 01:49:46,482
I didn't know about this until early this morning.

1186
01:49:46,923 --> 01:50:01,050
Somebody who's my long, long time friend and learned about Catholicism in Catholic food, in Italian food at my house, made sure from Israel that she had someone get in touch with me to let me know this was going on tonight.

1187
01:50:01,591 --> 01:50:06,814
I think it's kind of sad that Medford is an international known for things like this.

1188
01:50:09,295 --> 01:50:12,377
Anyway, boycott, divestment, and sanctions.

1189
01:50:12,878 --> 01:50:20,003
And this message, too, is for those who said earlier this evening that you're implying that Israel is part of this.

1190
01:50:20,504 --> 01:50:22,065
This is how they define themselves.

1191
01:50:22,585 --> 01:50:35,095
Boycott, divestment, and sanctions, BDS, is a Palestinian-led movement promoting boycotts, divestments, and economic sanctions against Israel.

1192
01:50:35,735 --> 01:50:37,877
Its objective is to pressure Israel to

1193
01:50:39,238 --> 01:50:46,866
excuse me, meet what the BDS movement describes as Israel's obligations under international law.

1194
01:50:48,655 --> 01:50:52,897
There's a lot of paradoxes that are created in this definition.

1195
01:50:52,917 --> 01:50:54,979
I don't have to begin to tell you what they are.

1196
01:50:55,559 --> 01:50:59,301
And I'm going to go to the end because I don't have time for the middle because I have a minute.

1197
01:51:00,101 --> 01:51:15,230
From what I understand during the last few weeks, especially with the distinguished Netanyahu meeting at the White House, I don't care what you think of the White House administration, there has been a stability now brought for at least a decade because of what we had to do.

1198
01:51:16,150 --> 01:51:26,018
So I do not see in these peace talks that this coalition has anything to do with anything that you could move forward and spend our money on.

1199
01:51:26,558 --> 01:51:31,602
This is an international issue at the present time, and you're rekindling the fire again.

1200
01:51:32,183 --> 01:51:34,644
Let the real experts work on the peace.

1201
01:51:34,905 --> 01:51:35,305
Thank you.

1202
01:51:35,365 --> 01:51:35,705
Thank you.

1203
01:51:35,825 --> 01:51:36,766
Thank you for your comment.

1204
01:51:38,768 --> 01:51:41,670
I'm going to go back to Zoom, then I'll come back to the podium.

1205
01:51:41,730 --> 01:51:44,092
I'm going to go to Micah on Zoom.

1206
01:51:44,292 --> 01:51:45,333
Micah, you'll have one minute.

1207
01:51:47,508 --> 01:51:49,349
One second, I just have to reset the timer.

1208
01:51:55,791 --> 01:51:58,032
Requesting you to unmute, name and address for the record.

1209
01:51:58,052 --> 01:51:58,813
You'll have one minute.

1210
01:51:59,293 --> 01:51:59,633
Sure, yeah.

1211
01:51:59,793 --> 01:52:01,374
Micah Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

1212
01:52:01,394 --> 01:52:04,215
We have a minute, so.

1213
01:52:04,655 --> 01:52:16,360
But look, I will say that for those of you who have understandable financial concerns, do understand that similar ordinances in other cities in Michigan and elsewhere in the country

1214
01:52:17,170 --> 01:52:25,442
have gone into effect and their portfolios have just done fine, if not outperformed their non curated counterparts.

1215
01:52:25,963 --> 01:52:31,090
So financially, this isn't that big of a deal for the city's municipal funds.

1216
01:52:31,831 --> 01:52:32,793
So don't like so.

1217
01:52:34,307 --> 01:52:35,407
You look at the data, it just isn't.

1218
01:52:36,267 --> 01:52:38,028
But the concern is understood.

1219
01:52:39,248 --> 01:52:45,369
For those of you who are concerned about this dividing the community, again, this is coming from a substantial portion of the community.

1220
01:52:46,029 --> 01:53:02,793
So if you guys who are definitely not just hungry, hopeful politicians are concerned about dividing the community, then perhaps you should be looking at trying to bridge that gap that you perceive in the community and talking to maybe that portion of the community that you, I guess, don't talk to for some reason.

1221
01:53:02,813 --> 01:53:03,573
I don't know why that is.

1222
01:53:04,714 --> 01:53:05,595
You know, weird.

1223
01:53:07,899 --> 01:53:15,290
But for everyone else, like, you know, what pains me right now is that, you know, my grandparents used to say,

1224
01:53:20,183 --> 01:53:31,594
There's so much fear right now about this being anti-Semitic and this being somehow against Jews and attacking the interests of Jews, even though it nowhere refers to Jews or Judaism.

1225
01:53:32,135 --> 01:53:35,258
At most, it is targeted towards Israel at most.

1226
01:53:39,001 --> 01:53:44,945
you are feeding into this narrative that to be Jewish is to be loyal to Israel first and foremost.

1227
01:53:45,625 --> 01:54:03,117
And I cannot say how, I cannot understate how incredibly dangerous it is to facilitate, enable, and actually espouse a narrative that Jews are Israeli and Jews are to Israel before they are to the U.S.

1228
01:54:03,157 --> 01:54:04,418
or to their local communities.

1229
01:54:04,958 --> 01:54:06,559
That's crazy and dangerous.

1230
01:54:07,020 --> 01:54:09,301
You need to think about that.

1231
01:54:09,341 --> 01:54:16,005
Religious leaders, I urge you to maybe try and talk to the different parts of the Jewish community and have a conversation to address that fear.

1232
01:54:16,585 --> 01:54:18,867
Because right now, you're just fostering it.

1233
01:54:18,907 --> 01:54:26,712
You're mongering in that fear rather than actually trying to alleviate it, which as a leader is important to do for the Jewish community.

1234
01:54:26,952 --> 01:54:27,812
Micah, thank you.

1235
01:54:28,113 --> 01:54:28,473
Thank you.

1236
01:54:33,050 --> 01:54:35,771
going to go back to the podium and name and address for the record.

1237
01:54:35,951 --> 01:54:36,772
You'll have one minute.

1238
01:54:37,132 --> 01:54:39,233
William Ellison, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1239
01:54:40,093 --> 01:54:41,254
You have a great opportunity.

1240
01:54:41,774 --> 01:54:49,898
Bring people together, bring people together in small groups, bring people together to talk to each other and talk with each other and understand the history of the Middle East.

1241
01:54:50,418 --> 01:54:55,040
Understand the tensions, understand all the peace treaties that were broken and not gone forward.

1242
01:54:55,641 --> 01:54:59,843
So we can basically have a really good understanding of how to go forward.

1243
01:55:00,383 --> 01:55:02,304
A performative ordinance

1244
01:55:02,787 --> 01:55:09,910
that's going to get knocked down by legal issues, financial issues, and other things like that, doesn't really bring people together.

1245
01:55:10,550 --> 01:55:12,911
Try to find ways so people can sit together and talk.

1246
01:55:13,471 --> 01:55:20,754
I can tell you that last year or the year before, we had a book club at the temple, and we invited the imam from the cultural center.

1247
01:55:20,974 --> 01:55:23,355
Great discussion, great discussion.

1248
01:55:24,035 --> 01:55:26,456
We're as concerned about Muslims as we are about Jews.

1249
01:55:27,237 --> 01:55:30,198
We understand that any number of people can be discriminated against.

1250
01:55:31,011 --> 01:55:47,163
the way to bring things together, the way to build community, is not to put something out there that fragments, but to put in place processes that enable us to talk with each other, share viewpoints, and come to new understandings that allow us to move forward as a community.

1251
01:55:47,183 --> 01:55:51,046
I appreciate your understanding, and I hope that you'll take that advice.

1252
01:55:51,066 --> 01:55:51,667
Thank you.

1253
01:55:51,687 --> 01:55:52,167
Thank you.

1254
01:55:56,770 --> 01:55:59,793
You haven't spoken yet, so you will have three minutes.

1255
01:56:01,633 --> 01:56:02,697
Name and address for the record, please.

1256
01:56:03,219 --> 01:56:04,946
Patrick Clerkin, 50 Princeton Street.

1257
01:56:05,870 --> 01:56:18,716
So I wanted to address two particular sub-issues on this, and the first is related to the wholesale divestment from particularly the fossil fuel industries.

1258
01:56:19,997 --> 01:56:24,139
I think that people don't realize the ripple effects of the fossil fuel divestment.

1259
01:56:24,199 --> 01:56:27,821
There are other industries, the chemical industry, the plastics industry.

1260
01:56:28,361 --> 01:56:32,063
I have critiques of all of these industries, and I think that there's

1261
01:56:33,343 --> 01:56:37,025
substantial negatives to them, but there's also substantial positives to them.

1262
01:56:37,405 --> 01:56:53,392
A lot of what we have that we take for granted are clothes, eyeglasses, equipment around us, medical equipment, vehicle equipment that reduce vehicle weight and that reduce vehicle emissions.

1263
01:56:53,452 --> 01:56:58,555
A lot of good things come from the fossil fuel industry and its byproducts.

1264
01:56:59,455 --> 01:57:02,518
And so I'm concerned with the wholesale divestment, first of all.

1265
01:57:02,958 --> 01:57:09,925
And the second thing is, I think there are other industries that equally have downsides to them.

1266
01:57:10,546 --> 01:57:17,152
So looking at defense, we're focusing on how the defense industries have more of an emphasis on

1267
01:57:17,552 --> 01:57:19,413
war rather than defense and peace.

1268
01:57:19,633 --> 01:57:20,953
I understand that criticism.

1269
01:57:21,814 --> 01:57:30,617
You could add to the list media, which tends to emphasize getting people profiting off of getting people to hate each other.

1270
01:57:31,057 --> 01:57:38,800
You could focus on the pharmaceutical industry, which often focuses more on sickness rather than on health.

1271
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:55,184
I think it's easier to focus on defense industries and fossil fuel industries when they're located geographically in say Texas or the or the south of the United States and not focus on the pharmaceutical industry which is in our own backyard which has

1272
01:57:55,684 --> 01:58:00,827
jobs and money flowing through the veins of Massachusetts more so than these things that we're trying to divest.

1273
01:58:01,448 --> 01:58:10,273
And I think it's very specific and odd to focus on just several of these things and wholesale divest from them.

1274
01:58:10,693 --> 01:58:18,558
So I think if you look at the broad systems level perspective, there's tradeoffs everywhere, and I think it should be looked at more piecemeal.

1275
01:58:18,958 --> 01:58:19,279
Thank you.

1276
01:58:20,820 --> 01:58:21,100
Thank you.

1277
01:58:22,866 --> 01:58:28,304
Is there anyone in the chamber who would like to speak on public participation who hasn't spoken yet?

1278
01:58:34,857 --> 01:58:37,499
Hi, Angela Murphy, 16 Carding Street.

1279
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:40,781
And I didn't come here to speak on this issue.

1280
01:58:41,862 --> 01:58:47,066
And I can't speak on zoning, but I will relay that comment another time.

1281
01:58:47,986 --> 01:58:57,453
I just want to put in a comment that what I'm hearing that this concerns and this fear is actually real for this community.

1282
01:58:58,433 --> 01:58:58,974
I don't think

1283
01:58:59,934 --> 01:59:07,357
that you can deny that what they're telling you is something that they've lived through their ancestors in the past.

1284
01:59:07,997 --> 01:59:18,921
If this is gonna make them not feel comfortable and method, we could lose a whole community of residents who are beneficial to our diversity.

1285
01:59:19,801 --> 01:59:24,664
and I'm afraid for them, and I'm sorry this is happening, and they have to go through this again.

1286
01:59:25,204 --> 01:59:28,085
They want to deny what history has happened to certain people.

1287
01:59:28,746 --> 01:59:38,851
They're trying to erase it, but they can't erase it because it's too prominent in a lot of people's minds and told over centuries and through families.

1288
01:59:39,611 --> 01:59:40,372
Listen to them.

1289
01:59:40,932 --> 01:59:42,313
Rethink certain parts.

1290
01:59:42,873 --> 01:59:43,974
Talk about it again.

1291
01:59:44,414 --> 01:59:47,075
Go over it and hear their true concerns.

1292
01:59:48,556 --> 01:59:49,237
I feel for them.

1293
01:59:49,297 --> 01:59:49,958
I'm Catholic.

1294
01:59:50,838 --> 01:59:56,864
I was told if a Catholic person goes into a temple, they're going to go to hell.

1295
01:59:57,805 --> 01:59:59,507
My kids went to a Jewish temple.

1296
02:00:00,408 --> 02:00:05,172
I did not hold anything against any culture, any religion, anything.

1297
02:00:06,173 --> 02:00:26,331
And I feel for these people I didn't come up here to talk about this but I wanted to say that I'm sorry that they were going through in this, that you have this right here, and that I hope everybody listens to them, read things whatever is going on because I have no idea but I just hearing a concern for them, and as a fellow resident I've been here 69 years.

1298
02:00:28,706 --> 02:00:34,110
I want them to stay in the community and feel safe and walk around and not be concerned.

1299
02:00:34,170 --> 02:00:38,814
And maybe their concerns are valid to some degree, and I'm sure they are.

1300
02:00:39,294 --> 02:00:39,955
Listen to them.

1301
02:00:40,075 --> 02:00:40,455
Thank you.

1302
02:00:41,116 --> 02:00:41,916
Thank you for your comment.

1303
02:00:41,936 --> 02:00:49,302
Is there anyone else who has not spoken yet who would like to speak?

1304
02:00:53,013 --> 02:00:55,214
Seeing none, I'm going to go back to Zoom to Maria.

1305
02:00:55,274 --> 02:00:56,714
Maria, you'll have one minute.

1306
02:00:57,054 --> 02:00:58,594
I'm going to request you unmute.

1307
02:00:59,314 --> 02:01:01,055
Name and address for the record, please.

1308
02:01:14,058 --> 02:01:15,018
Maria, are you there?

1309
02:01:16,218 --> 02:01:17,019
Oh, hello.

1310
02:01:17,539 --> 02:01:22,500
I just wanted to say that a couple of people have asked you, President Behrs,

1311
02:01:23,347 --> 02:01:29,729
what you're gonna do and would you delete that paragraph and would you withdraw this?

1312
02:01:30,369 --> 02:01:34,991
And you haven't responded, which is disappointing.

1313
02:01:36,051 --> 02:01:37,672
After everyone's had a chance to speak.

1314
02:01:40,253 --> 02:01:41,353
That's all, thank you.

1315
02:01:42,173 --> 02:01:42,633
Thank you.

1316
02:01:48,355 --> 02:01:49,716
Going to go to Munir Germanis.

1317
02:01:51,010 --> 02:01:54,867
For one minute, Muneer, name and address for the record, and I'm asking you to unmute.

1318
02:02:00,642 --> 02:02:04,524
Hi, Munir Jamanis, 3 Summit Road in Medford.

1319
02:02:06,524 --> 02:02:18,729
Again, I guess I'm a little surprised that somebody is bringing up superfluous issues that have nothing to do with this proposed ordinance.

1320
02:02:20,049 --> 02:02:21,790
An example is BDS.

1321
02:02:23,030 --> 02:02:26,211
What they failed to say is that BDS

1322
02:02:29,020 --> 02:02:55,861
is a non-violent, peaceful approach to simply ask the government of Israel to stop the occupation, to end the apartheid system in which citizens in Israel that are of Palestinian origin don't have the same rights as citizens who are Jewish in Israel.

1323
02:02:57,884 --> 02:03:04,586
simply to end the occupation, then the BDS will go away, just like we did in South Africa.

1324
02:03:05,746 --> 02:03:06,086
Thank you.

1325
02:03:07,467 --> 02:03:08,407
Thank you for your comment.

1326
02:03:08,427 --> 02:03:15,389
I'm going to go to Eileen Lerner.

1327
02:03:15,649 --> 02:03:17,070
Name and address for the record, please.

1328
02:03:17,090 --> 02:03:17,770
You have one minute.

1329
02:03:20,453 --> 02:03:21,794
My name is Eileen Lerner.

1330
02:03:21,834 --> 02:03:24,735
I live at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1331
02:03:25,516 --> 02:03:31,879
And I just want to say that the Jewish community is more than the Jews that go to the synagogue in Medford.

1332
02:03:32,439 --> 02:03:42,285
There are many, many Jews in the Jewish community in Medford who support this resolution, whose values it expresses.

1333
02:03:43,105 --> 02:03:50,768
And I think it's very narrow minded to only think that the people that go to synagogue are Jews.

1334
02:03:51,008 --> 02:03:53,429
It's like, oh, are they the real Jews?

1335
02:03:53,709 --> 02:03:54,929
What about the rest of us?

1336
02:03:55,649 --> 02:03:56,930
You know, we're Jews, too.

1337
02:03:57,090 --> 02:03:57,970
What about us?

1338
02:03:58,090 --> 02:03:59,351
What about what we think?

1339
02:03:59,431 --> 02:04:00,951
What about what we value?

1340
02:04:01,671 --> 02:04:03,332
Which goes back to the Bible.

1341
02:04:04,474 --> 02:04:16,922
You know, if you read the Bible, I don't think, and even if you read the New Testament, I don't think you can have the values that we see operating in the world today.

1342
02:04:16,982 --> 02:04:18,503
We need to change things.

1343
02:04:18,623 --> 02:04:25,767
We can't keep going down the same path for the climate, for the children, for everybody.

1344
02:04:26,548 --> 02:04:28,429
We need to do something positive.

1345
02:04:28,489 --> 02:04:31,971
And this is a positive thing that is being proposed.

1346
02:04:32,932 --> 02:04:33,292
Thank you.

1347
02:04:34,785 --> 02:04:35,885
Thank you for your comment.

1348
02:04:37,966 --> 02:04:45,650
RM, I'm gonna need to ask you to either message me on the chat with your name or change your initials to a name on Zoom.

1349
02:04:46,210 --> 02:04:52,473
We've had Zoom bombing incidents and I'm not gonna unmute anyone unless they share their name on Zoom.

1350
02:04:56,914 --> 02:04:57,915
All right, thank you.

1351
02:04:58,355 --> 02:04:59,336
Thank you for doing that.

1352
02:04:59,896 --> 02:05:02,377
I'm gonna go to Patricia Brady-Doherty for one minute.

1353
02:05:03,408 --> 02:05:05,409
Patricia, name and address for the record.

1354
02:05:05,489 --> 02:05:07,210
You have one minute.

1355
02:05:09,272 --> 02:05:09,672
Thank you.

1356
02:05:10,172 --> 02:05:13,154
I'd like to address this through the chair to the prior speaker.

1357
02:05:14,915 --> 02:05:22,620
You don't have to be Jewish to care and hear the sadness and how frightened these people are.

1358
02:05:23,020 --> 02:05:26,662
This resolution cannot affect what happens in the Middle East.

1359
02:05:27,042 --> 02:05:29,764
In fact, it really doesn't even have a place on the council agenda.

1360
02:05:31,428 --> 02:05:33,729
I'm Catholic, but tonight I'm Jewish.

1361
02:05:34,369 --> 02:05:35,569
I feel for these people.

1362
02:05:35,910 --> 02:05:37,250
This is such a disgrace.

1363
02:05:37,610 --> 02:05:37,990
Thank you.

1364
02:05:40,131 --> 02:05:41,251
Thank you for your comment.

1365
02:05:53,496 --> 02:05:54,896
Rich, I'm gonna come to you.

1366
02:05:54,916 --> 02:05:56,677
Name and address for the record.

1367
02:05:56,697 --> 02:05:57,477
You'll have three minutes.

1368
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:03,620
Rich Maidman, 18 Sterling Street.

1369
02:06:04,561 --> 02:06:07,741
I'm here speaking in solidarity with the Medford Jewish community.

1370
02:06:08,802 --> 02:06:15,203
This thinly veiled targeting of the single Jewish state is despicable and offensive to members of the Jewish community.

1371
02:06:15,903 --> 02:06:23,325
And I urge the council to reject it and ignore all the anti-Semitic tropes that we just heard espoused in conjunction with it.

1372
02:06:24,057 --> 02:06:26,638
We also just heard a little bit about BDS.

1373
02:06:26,838 --> 02:06:32,619
What wasn't said is that the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist groups are instrumental in the BDS movement.

1374
02:06:33,359 --> 02:06:38,961
Now, moving on, significant portions of the bill are patently illegal and administratively impossible.

1375
02:06:39,421 --> 02:06:41,902
It's unbelievable that it has gotten to this point.

1376
02:06:42,942 --> 02:06:47,283
It almost feels like certain members of the council are trying to induce lawsuits against the city.

1377
02:06:48,637 --> 02:06:53,899
Those who vote for this bill also demonstrate their commitment to virtue signaling over the community they serve.

1378
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:56,561
You can't even hold index funds under it.

1379
02:06:57,281 --> 02:07:06,585
Whoever votes for this is responsible for any budget shortfalls that result in public parks not being kept up, school infrastructure crumbling, and public safety shortcomings.

1380
02:07:07,386 --> 02:07:12,148
It's a good thing you are not working for a public entity because your breach of fiduciary duties is colossal.

1381
02:07:13,382 --> 02:07:22,004
I call on all counselors considering voting for this bill to disclose all of their investments personally to ensure that they are not saying one thing and doing another.

1382
02:07:23,264 --> 02:07:32,286
And to many of those considering voting for this ordinance, remember that you were elected to serve your community, not adhere to the purity tests of national organizations.

1383
02:07:37,408 --> 02:07:38,308
Thank you for your comment.

1384
02:07:43,174 --> 02:07:45,295
going to go to Anna on Zoom.

1385
02:07:45,435 --> 02:07:47,076
Anna, name and address for the record, please.

1386
02:07:47,096 --> 02:07:47,937
You have three minutes.

1387
02:07:50,718 --> 02:07:52,219
Hi, my name is Anna Meyer.

1388
02:07:52,299 --> 02:07:55,201
I live at 6 Douglas Road, Medford, Massachusetts.

1389
02:07:56,101 --> 02:08:01,104
And I am speaking tonight in support of the divestment ordinance.

1390
02:08:02,164 --> 02:08:06,307
I think that this is an incredibly important moment for

1391
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:22,270
Medford to take responsibility for the work that our money does out in the world, and to commit our money to doing the things that we know are aligned with Medford's values, including not investing in detention.

1392
02:08:24,572 --> 02:08:38,403
of immigrant children and families that are being separated, divesting from fossil fuels, from weapons of mass destruction, as well as divesting from any companies that are profiting from

1393
02:08:40,173 --> 02:08:42,534
any crimes against humanity.

1394
02:08:42,594 --> 02:08:56,317
And while that certainly would include the crimes that are being committed every day against people in Gaza, the news headlines today just said that 59 children were shot while waiting in line for water.

1395
02:08:56,337 --> 02:09:02,958
This is absolutely an ordinance that will go far and beyond that to really make sure that we are investing

1396
02:09:03,919 --> 02:09:05,540
in line with Medford values.

1397
02:09:06,921 --> 02:09:32,018
I also want to iterate that this is a resolution that was brought forward by Medford residents, and we have been working on it carefully to make sure that it reflects our interests, as well as thoughtfulness in working with the specific definitions that are included in this ordinance to make sure that it is in line with international law that is working to make sure

1398
02:09:32,838 --> 02:09:43,444
that our money is gonna be invested in ways that support the wellbeing of children and families and the environment everywhere and not investing in systems of harm.

1399
02:09:43,504 --> 02:09:49,027
So I'm grateful for your support of the resolution and hearing comments tonight.

1400
02:09:49,147 --> 02:09:49,548
Thank you.

1401
02:09:51,629 --> 02:09:52,750
Thank you for your comment.

1402
02:09:52,770 --> 02:09:58,793
Is there anyone either in person or on Zoom who has or has not spoken who would like to speak?

1403
02:10:01,609 --> 02:10:03,130
Yes, you have one minute.

1404
02:10:03,170 --> 02:10:04,871
Name and address for the record, please.

1405
02:10:05,071 --> 02:10:06,952
State Mayor 373 Riverside Ave.

1406
02:10:07,832 --> 02:10:12,235
Drop this whole resolution and instead maybe focus on something that brings everyone together.

1407
02:10:12,915 --> 02:10:19,819
I guarantee you could get for all the time and energy spent on this and all the negative energy, you could have had one heck of a blood drive.

1408
02:10:20,639 --> 02:10:22,220
And that would benefit people in your city.

1409
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:24,802
That would benefit people in your local area.

1410
02:10:25,982 --> 02:10:29,024
Pretty sure the Red Cross would take people's blood and use it all over the world.

1411
02:10:30,928 --> 02:10:33,489
Drop this, do something positive, maybe something like that.

1412
02:10:34,289 --> 02:10:35,830
How many people here would donate blood?

1413
02:10:35,850 --> 02:10:43,332
You know what, that's at least 10 pints more than you had.

1414
02:10:43,372 --> 02:10:47,113
If you're gonna spend taxpayer dollars on something, do something positive for the world.

1415
02:10:47,353 --> 02:10:47,734
Thank you.

1416
02:10:48,774 --> 02:10:49,894
Thank you for your comment.

1417
02:10:53,075 --> 02:10:55,036
Seeing no further, would you like to speak, Andy?

1418
02:10:55,216 --> 02:10:55,456
Yes.

1419
02:10:57,357 --> 02:10:58,157
You have one minute.

1420
02:11:00,263 --> 02:11:01,263
I'll take a few seconds.

1421
02:11:01,924 --> 02:11:03,344
What was I gonna say?

1422
02:11:05,865 --> 02:11:15,468
Nobody's right if everybody is wrong, as the song says, but let's us not forget what happened October 7th, 2023.

1423
02:11:15,648 --> 02:11:18,809
Innocent people in a concert.

1424
02:11:19,589 --> 02:11:21,970
That's equivalent to three, two and a half.

1425
02:11:25,291 --> 02:11:28,952
What happened in New York City, you know, the World Trade Center.

1426
02:11:30,058 --> 02:11:30,979
That was horrendous.

1427
02:11:31,179 --> 02:11:37,507
After thousands of years, wrong, two wrongs don't make a right, but that was horrendous.

1428
02:11:37,687 --> 02:11:39,449
And I cannot watch that video.

1429
02:11:40,170 --> 02:11:41,492
I don't have a stomach for it.

1430
02:11:42,813 --> 02:11:43,194
Thank you.

1431
02:11:48,958 --> 02:11:49,458
Thanks, everyone.

1432
02:11:49,478 --> 02:11:52,220
I appreciate the comments that we heard tonight.

1433
02:11:52,580 --> 02:11:59,725
I have had a number of conversations over the last couple of weeks with people who have questions and concerns about the ordinance.

1434
02:12:00,065 --> 02:12:08,011
I'm still working to reach out to everybody who has emailed me or otherwise tried to contact me about it.

1435
02:12:08,651 --> 02:12:14,235
The reason there are no edits in the version that was on the agenda tonight is that I did not have control over the process.

1436
02:12:14,815 --> 02:12:34,831
This was tabled from last meeting, using a council procedural rule that required it to come up again at this meeting, I am planning to propose amendments to the ordinance and I am planning to communicate with many of the people who have spoken tonight about the content of the ordinance, I don't think that we will all completely agree on everything

1437
02:12:35,571 --> 02:12:58,221
that ever happens in this chamber, but I am working to have conversations to address the concerns that have been raised tonight, concerns that have been raised to me outside of this meeting, so that we can create a product that reflects what I think are shared values in this community, and also respects and listens to, I think, the very real fears that people have shared with me in person, in this meeting, and in other places.

1438
02:12:59,421 --> 02:13:03,124
I would ask folks to look at what I said at our last meeting.

1439
02:13:03,144 --> 02:13:05,166
I gave two what I think

1440
02:13:08,978 --> 02:13:16,282
We're very honest and direct remarks about why I propose this ordinance and my feelings about the comments that were shared at the last meeting.

1441
02:13:16,962 --> 02:13:25,206
And I do want to apologize to folks that we haven't had the chance to meet or talk yet or that the edits weren't made yet, but there will be changes.

1442
02:13:25,586 --> 02:13:32,630
And we're going to work through this to create a product that, and an ordinance that addresses as many concerns as we can.

1443
02:13:33,210 --> 02:13:37,012
So I just wanted to say that, but I wanted to give everyone a chance to speak before I did.

1444
02:13:38,238 --> 02:13:39,939
I'm going to recognize Councillor Collins.

1445
02:13:45,604 --> 02:13:48,206
Thank you, President Behrs for allowing me the opportunity to speak.

1446
02:13:48,747 --> 02:13:51,489
I'll keep this brief because the paper has been tabled.

1447
02:13:51,509 --> 02:13:53,931
We have other items on the agenda still to get to.

1448
02:13:53,951 --> 02:14:04,860
I shared a lot three weeks ago about my reasons for supporting this ordinance, and I will not repeat all of that tonight, especially because this will be coming up before the council again.

1449
02:14:05,947 --> 02:14:11,251
for both councillors and members of the public to comment on in a future meeting.

1450
02:14:12,752 --> 02:14:27,543
I just wanted to share before I make a motion to revert back to our regular order of business, that as Medford's first and only Jewish city councillor, I hope that our future conversations on this ordinance

1451
02:14:28,493 --> 02:14:31,216
contain less anti-Semitic language than what I heard tonight.

1452
02:14:31,296 --> 02:14:43,067
And by that, I mean, I will say every time it happens, how offensive I find it as a Jew, when anybody purports to speak for the Jewish community as a monolith.

1453
02:14:44,448 --> 02:14:48,132
We do not all support this ordinance or ordinances like it.

1454
02:14:48,172 --> 02:14:49,373
We do not all condemn it.

1455
02:14:50,074 --> 02:14:51,755
We do not all feel scared by it.

1456
02:14:52,316 --> 02:14:53,537
Some of us do, apparently.

1457
02:14:54,780 --> 02:14:59,102
Not all Jews feel an inherent link between the nation-state of Israel and the Jewish people.

1458
02:14:59,963 --> 02:15:10,008
The Jewish community is an incredibly religiously, culturally, ethnically, ideologically, and politically plural community.

1459
02:15:11,369 --> 02:15:23,436
To say that the Jewish community is a monolith, to purport to speak for the entire Jewish community, and I'm speaking to people who do not identify as Jews, as well as people who are, on this ordinance, on anything else, I find is anti-Semitic.

1460
02:15:24,431 --> 02:15:31,075
And I sincerely hope that when we continue our productive conversations about this ordinance in future meetings, people can speak for themselves.

1461
02:15:31,855 --> 02:15:33,876
They can speak for people that they have personally talked to.

1462
02:15:33,916 --> 02:15:35,417
They can speak for groups that they represent.

1463
02:15:36,378 --> 02:15:46,784
And I fervently wish that people will not be so offensive to the Jewish community to report that we are a flat monolith with one opinion on any issue.

1464
02:15:47,604 --> 02:15:48,745
It is extremely offensive.

1465
02:15:50,346 --> 02:15:50,846
Thank you for the time.

1466
02:15:53,804 --> 02:16:03,109
Thank you on the motion of the vice president to revert to the regular order of business seconded by seconded by Councilor Lemming, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1467
02:16:07,931 --> 02:16:08,512
Councilor Kellyanne?

1468
02:16:10,072 --> 02:16:10,853
Vice President Collins?

1469
02:16:11,373 --> 02:16:11,593
Yes.

1470
02:16:12,994 --> 02:16:13,834
Councilor Lozaro?

1471
02:16:14,415 --> 02:16:14,715
Yes.

1472
02:16:15,935 --> 02:16:16,376
Councilor Lemming?

1473
02:16:16,396 --> 02:16:16,456
Yes.

1474
02:16:17,156 --> 02:16:17,776
Councilor Scarpelli?

1475
02:16:17,796 --> 02:16:17,876
Yes.

1476
02:16:19,317 --> 02:16:19,837
Councilor Sang?

1477
02:16:20,658 --> 02:16:20,818
Yes.

1478
02:16:22,782 --> 02:16:38,338
Yes, 70 affirmative, none of the negative the motion passes and we revert to the regular order of business to 5113 offered by counselor Scarpelli resolve the city council get an update from the health department for rodent issues in the Wellington Glenwood neighborhoods, Middlesex Avenue area counselor Scarpelli.

1479
02:16:38,838 --> 02:16:39,759
Thank you, Mr. President.

1480
02:16:39,879 --> 02:17:03,931
I think we've exhausted so many avenues, and I know that our health department has worked on this, but I think we need to hold a community meeting because it wasn't just the neighborhood from Walter Glenwood reached out because they feel like they haven't been supported, but as that happened, I received phone calls from every other corner of the city of Medford, and I think that we owe it to our residents that we hold a community meeting

1481
02:17:05,352 --> 02:17:13,379
to really share the concerns and issues that is now turned in to a pretty substantial crisis in the city.

1482
02:17:13,779 --> 02:17:15,261
And that's the rat infestation.

1483
02:17:15,321 --> 02:17:29,674
So I would appreciate the council to allow me to make the motion that we call for a community meeting with the health department and the pest company and the city administration to really get a hold of these concerns and issues.

1484
02:17:29,714 --> 02:17:29,994
Thank you.

1485
02:17:31,421 --> 02:17:39,469
Mr. Scarpelli, is that a motion to refer this paper to Committee of the Whole and invite the Health Department and Pest Control and the administration?

1486
02:17:40,910 --> 02:17:42,772
Mr. Clerk, when you have the motion, please let me know.

1487
02:17:46,295 --> 02:17:51,340
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to refer the paper to the Committee of the Whole, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1488
02:17:51,481 --> 02:17:52,682
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1489
02:17:56,172 --> 02:17:57,393
President Behrs, I have a question.

1490
02:17:57,473 --> 02:17:58,193
Oh, sorry.

1491
02:17:58,313 --> 02:17:59,835
Councilor Lazaro, before we call the roll.

1492
02:17:59,895 --> 02:18:00,635
Councilor Lazaro?

1493
02:18:02,917 --> 02:18:12,263
Through the chair, I was wondering if Councilor Scarpelli has spoken to the health department or to what degree has there been conversations?

1494
02:18:14,384 --> 02:18:18,127
The councilor just has a question through the chair to Councilor Scarpelli about your conversations with the health department.

1495
02:18:27,551 --> 02:18:29,872
Sorry, I got to turn on your microphone.

1496
02:18:29,892 --> 02:18:30,192
Go ahead.

1497
02:18:30,212 --> 02:18:30,412
Sorry.

1498
02:18:31,032 --> 02:18:34,093
I know that Councils brought up the same issues over and over again.

1499
02:18:34,533 --> 02:18:43,095
So I haven't done this recently since this, the messages I've received the residents, but I would call for a meeting with all parties involved.

1500
02:18:43,175 --> 02:18:47,116
I think we have to now try to move to the next level if we can, Council President.

1501
02:18:49,277 --> 02:18:52,998
Thank you, Councilor Lazaro.

1502
02:18:53,118 --> 02:18:53,858
That's fine.

1503
02:18:54,038 --> 02:18:54,518
Also, thank you.

1504
02:18:56,082 --> 02:18:56,562
Thank you.

1505
02:18:56,582 --> 02:18:59,885
On the motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1506
02:19:02,267 --> 02:19:03,148
Vice President Collins.

1507
02:19:04,729 --> 02:19:04,929
Yes.

1508
02:19:06,631 --> 02:19:06,811
Yes.

1509
02:19:06,831 --> 02:19:06,891
Yes.

1510
02:19:06,911 --> 02:19:07,151
Yes.

1511
02:19:07,211 --> 02:19:07,451
Yes.

1512
02:19:08,933 --> 02:19:10,894
Yes, I'm the affirmative.

1513
02:19:12,075 --> 02:19:13,917
None of the negative emotion passes.

1514
02:19:21,597 --> 02:19:39,510
Paper 25114 offered by Councillor Callahan and President Behrs whereas as part of its 2024 2025 governing agenda and previous resolutions the council has stated its intention to implement the good landlord tax credit in order to help keep rents affordable and support landlords who offer below market rental rates and

1515
02:19:40,110 --> 02:19:52,159
whereas the state law enabling the good landlord tax credit s 1795 specifically limits the quote qualified residential rental property to any unsubsidized two to four unit residential rental property

1516
02:19:52,978 --> 02:20:10,180
And whereas the reason the council has not yet adopted this provision of state law is because of an analysis by the assessing department that stated that the tax credit would not be limited to small two to four unit rental properties, and this would provide a significant unintended benefit to corporate owners of large properties and impact the city's property tax levy.

1517
02:20:10,780 --> 02:20:37,368
Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we request that the city solicitor provide a written legal opinion on whether the local adoption of the Good Landlord Tax Credit could be limited to two to four unit properties and provide both the City Council and the Chief Assessor with said opinion and be it further resolved that we request that the Chief Assessor provide the City Council with the potential impact of a Medford Good Landlord Tax Credit on the city's property tax levy based on the opinion provided by the city solicitor.

1518
02:20:37,868 --> 02:20:38,668
Councillor Callahan.

1519
02:20:40,923 --> 02:20:41,203
Thank you.

1520
02:20:43,303 --> 02:20:46,764
I know that I am in favor of the good landlord tax credit.

1521
02:20:47,524 --> 02:21:00,426
I know there has been some investigation sort of behind the scenes about asking the assessor about whether it would in fact be limited to two to four unit properties.

1522
02:21:01,887 --> 02:21:09,068
And I think that it's just, it would be best for us to have this discussion in a committee where we can all hear the assessor's opinion.

1523
02:21:10,169 --> 02:21:10,689
It would be great.

1524
02:21:10,910 --> 02:21:27,047
We have a new solicitor or bigger to have the solicitor, you know, provide legal opinion because really it is a legal opinion on what this state law, whether the state law will actually do what it is written that it will do, or if it will not be upheld to that writing that passed in the past session.

1525
02:21:28,947 --> 02:21:42,531
And I really want to get to the bottom of whether we can pass this here in Medford because I would like to, and I just want to understand and have the full council be able to understand if there are reasons why we're not able to get this thing passed.

1526
02:21:44,671 --> 02:21:45,812
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

1527
02:21:45,892 --> 02:21:46,572
Councilor Lemming.

1528
02:21:47,987 --> 02:21:48,387
Thank you.

1529
02:21:48,567 --> 02:21:49,929
I fully agree.

1530
02:21:50,049 --> 02:21:57,534
I had conversations with the assessor about a year ago about potentially passing the new good landlord tax credit.

1531
02:21:57,574 --> 02:22:11,905
And he basically said that it was a, well, he hinted that it wouldn't quite have the effect that we wanted because it would apply equally to landlords, like small local landlords who willingly kept their,

1532
02:22:12,926 --> 02:22:23,953
kept their rents low, as well as larger properties that are usually owned by companies who are, in many cases, required to keep affordable housing rates.

1533
02:22:24,133 --> 02:22:27,335
There's no sort of legal way to distinguish between the two under state law.

1534
02:22:27,736 --> 02:22:36,041
But I think it would be worthwhile to have those discussions in public and have a bit more of a formal analysis.

1535
02:22:36,201 --> 02:22:39,203
So I'd like to thank my colleagues for bringing this forward.

1536
02:22:41,970 --> 02:22:43,094
Thank you, Councillor Lameing.

1537
02:22:43,194 --> 02:22:43,857
Councillor Seng.

1538
02:22:45,028 --> 02:22:45,708
Thank you.

1539
02:22:45,929 --> 02:22:52,833
I just wanted to thank my fellow Councillors for introducing this resolution, for getting the ball started again.

1540
02:22:52,853 --> 02:22:55,155
I wanted to refer my support for this.

1541
02:22:56,236 --> 02:23:02,920
Policy in general, of course, we'll have to look at the details of whether this does exactly what we want it to do.

1542
02:23:03,801 --> 02:23:09,305
And I know Councillor Lemming just brought up a point that I'd like to delve deeper into in the committee meeting.

1543
02:23:10,305 --> 02:23:12,607
But in general, I just wanted to voice my support.

1544
02:23:16,176 --> 02:23:17,057
Thank you, Councillor Saing.

1545
02:23:17,077 --> 02:23:19,718
Is there any further discussion by members of the Council?

1546
02:23:22,460 --> 02:23:25,422
Seeing none, is there any discussion by members of the public on this resolution?

1547
02:23:28,004 --> 02:23:36,669
Seeing no one in the chambers and no hands on Zoom, on the motion of Councillor Callaghan, seconded by Councillor Lemming.

1548
02:23:36,749 --> 02:23:37,990
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1549
02:23:42,153 --> 02:23:45,195
This is to approve and send to the administration.

1550
02:23:46,143 --> 02:23:47,624
This is a good letter of tax credit.

1551
02:23:48,305 --> 02:23:50,767
Asking the city for their opinion and then the assessor for the motion.

1552
02:23:54,130 --> 02:23:54,750

1560
02:24:04,979 --> 02:24:05,700

02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:06,280

1565
02:24:10,724 --> 02:24:11,004

Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

1579
02:25:17,236 --> 02:25:19,257
Sincerely, Brianna Longo Kern, Mayor.

1580
02:25:20,065 --> 02:25:22,648
We have, I think, Nick Belytheau here to talk about it.

1581
02:25:22,728 --> 02:25:26,233
Nick, I'm going to recognize you if you want to talk about the event.

1582
02:25:27,394 --> 02:25:28,095
Certainly, thank you.

1583
02:25:28,996 --> 02:25:38,047
Yes, basically we just want to put on events for Saturdays in August to a bit of an experimental to put something back for the community, Medford Square's a bit

1584
02:25:39,184 --> 02:25:40,545
it's a little bit quiet these days.

1585
02:25:41,465 --> 02:25:45,228
And we've seen Arlington and other cities where they have very similar things.

1586
02:25:45,708 --> 02:25:58,516
So I thought as part of Medford Brewing, what we could try and do is put together something, say we'll offer some music, some fun times, very family friendly, so people can mingle, get to know each other, hang out and have a good time.

1587
02:26:01,858 --> 02:26:02,278
Thank you, Nick.

1588
02:26:02,318 --> 02:26:03,119
I appreciate that.

1589
02:26:06,461 --> 02:26:08,362
Any comments or questions by members of the council?

1590
02:26:11,365 --> 02:26:14,327

Seconded by Councillor Callahan.

1592
02:26:16,328 --> 02:26:17,548
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1593
02:26:20,550 --> 02:26:21,130

Vice President Collins.

1596
02:26:24,151 --> 02:26:24,392

02:26:27,073 --> 02:26:27,393

Councillor Lemming.

1600
02:26:28,954 --> 02:26:29,394
Yes.

1601
02:26:29,834 --> 02:26:30,435
Councillor Scarpelli.

1602
02:26:30,455 --> 02:26:30,535

Councillor Hussain.

1604
02:26:32,476 --> 02:26:32,736
Yes.

1605
02:26:34,577 --> 02:26:37,158
Yes, I have the affirmative, none the negative, the motion passes.

1606
02:26:40,245 --> 02:26:46,489
25116 submitted by Mayor Briena Lingo-Kern, CPA appropriation request, Medford Armory Emergency Facade Restoration.

1607
02:26:46,609 --> 02:27:06,180
Dear President Behrs and City Councilors, on behalf of the Community Preservation Committee, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following recommendation of the Community Preservation Committee, requesting the appropriation of $37,280 from the CPA Historic Preservation Reserve to the Fonzie Condominium Trust to provide funding for emergency facade restoration repairs.

1608
02:27:06,640 --> 02:27:08,922
The project will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund.

1609
02:27:08,942 --> 02:27:11,704
The CPC recommendation letter is attached and incorporated.

1610
02:27:11,724 --> 02:27:17,708
Community Preservation Act Manager Teresa Dupont and representatives from the Fonzie County Minimum Trust will be in attendance to address the Council.

1611
02:27:18,088 --> 02:27:19,129
Thank you for your consideration.

1612
02:27:19,169 --> 02:27:21,070
Respectfully submitted, Brianna Lugo-Kern, Mayor.

1613
02:27:22,871 --> 02:27:25,253
I will recognize Teresa Dupont, CPA Manager.

1614
02:27:26,905 --> 02:27:27,806
Good evening, everybody.

1615
02:27:27,846 --> 02:27:29,187
Thank you so much for making the time.

1616
02:27:29,267 --> 02:27:31,248
Happy to be the caboose on this evening tonight.

1617
02:27:31,749 --> 02:27:39,735
We're here today to seek CPA appropriation for historic preservation of the Medford Armory that's right here in Medford Square.

1618
02:27:40,596 --> 02:27:45,660
Unfortunately, members from the trust could not join me tonight, but I'm happy to answer any questions.

1619
02:27:45,700 --> 02:27:47,261
This is a quick brief overview.

1620
02:27:47,841 --> 02:27:51,344
They have done their due diligence as stewards of this historic building.

1621
02:27:51,464 --> 02:27:53,206
This is a prominent building to Medford.

1622
02:27:53,266 --> 02:27:54,006
It is our armory.

1623
02:27:55,367 --> 02:28:01,790
Actually, interestingly, I did a little bit more research into this and it was financed by Samuel Crocker Lawrence.

1624
02:28:02,450 --> 02:28:11,854
So our very first mayor had his fingers very much into that building here, but it was used as military facility up until it was sold and I believe in the 70s.

1625
02:28:13,155 --> 02:28:21,221
What they're looking to do right now is they've again done their due diligence conducted conditions assessment of the building once they started noticing some failures of the exterior.

1626
02:28:22,301 --> 02:28:26,704
And have started putting together financial packages for what that looks like.

1627
02:28:26,744 --> 02:28:29,406
They're looking down the barrel of an $800,000 project.

1628
02:28:30,007 --> 02:28:41,995
But what we are here before you tonight is to ask for emergency funding to fix one particular corner of the facade that is experiencing some water inundation that is

1629
02:28:43,617 --> 02:28:47,138
exacerbating the issues, the known issues with the building exterior.

1630
02:28:48,398 --> 02:28:59,341
So they have come to us asking for a 50% match on that funding, and the Council has, our committee has recommended that funding.

1631
02:28:59,361 --> 02:29:03,022
So again, happy to answer any questions.

1632
02:29:04,883 --> 02:29:06,343
Thank you, Manager Dupont.

1633
02:29:06,363 --> 02:29:11,665
Do we have any questions from members of the Council?

1634
02:29:15,218 --> 02:29:16,199
Seeing none, is there a motion?

1635
02:29:17,420 --> 02:29:23,364
On the motion to approve by Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Callahan, I'm going to go to Mr. Castagnetti.

1636
02:29:23,464 --> 02:29:24,345
Name and address for the record.

1637
02:29:24,365 --> 02:29:25,025
You have three minutes.

1638
02:29:25,946 --> 02:29:28,928
I just have one question.

1639
02:29:29,228 --> 02:29:32,891
I thought the armory was under private ownership.

1640
02:29:33,391 --> 02:29:37,274
Are we allowed to use our public money on a private building?

1641
02:29:41,604 --> 02:29:42,184
I can address that.

1642
02:29:42,325 --> 02:29:42,605
Yes.

1643
02:29:42,865 --> 02:29:44,006
It is privately owned.

1644
02:29:44,306 --> 02:29:47,689
However, this building is on the National Registry of Historic Places.

1645
02:29:47,709 --> 02:29:48,690
Sorry.

1646
02:29:48,930 --> 02:29:53,033
It's National Registry of Historic Places, so that is a historical asset.

1647
02:29:53,694 --> 02:29:57,777
I will say that it is very much eligible under Department of Revenue

1648
02:29:58,297 --> 02:29:59,637
we're looking at.

1649
02:29:59,657 --> 02:29:59,838
Guidance.

1650
02:29:59,858 --> 02:30:03,999
Um whether or not it's necessarily a priority of the Community Preservation Committee.

1651
02:30:04,019 --> 02:30:10,601
That is one thing we will be looking at our guidelines for future applications as it pertains to private entities.

1652
02:30:11,621 --> 02:30:15,402
We felt the committee felt very strongly that this is an asset for the city of

1653
02:30:21,084 --> 02:30:26,809
So we felt that this was a good partnership for the immediate move of fixing this emergency funding.

1654
02:30:27,330 --> 02:30:28,391
What's the total cost?

1655
02:30:28,951 --> 02:30:32,114
I believe the total cost for the project is somewhere around $800,000.

1656
02:30:32,214 --> 02:30:38,420
They're intending to phase that in over the next few years so that it's not a huge financial burden to the organization.

1657
02:30:41,402 --> 02:30:41,883
Thank you.

1658
02:30:41,903 --> 02:30:44,325
Do we have any other comment from members of the public on this?

1659
02:30:45,106 --> 02:30:47,127
Seeing Mr. Fiori, name and address for the record.

1660
02:30:47,147 --> 02:30:47,628
You have three minutes.

1661
02:30:48,564 --> 02:31:02,952
Thank you, Mr. President Gaston fear 61 stinger actually Andy basically asked my question so what is exactly what makes this private building, able to receive these funds that is what.

1662
02:31:05,415 --> 02:31:11,939
Again, as it does have special designation as a, yes, it's a protected building under the National Registry of Historic Places.

1663
02:31:12,179 --> 02:31:27,148
And again, the committee doesn't wanna set any sort of precedence for private ownership, but under historic preservation, under the Department of Revenue guidance, if it meets these certain parameters, which it does, we are able to fund private entities.

1664
02:31:27,488 --> 02:31:34,273
And again, it's not something we wanna set precedence for, and we will be reevaluating our guidelines going forwards just so that we can

1665
02:31:35,013 --> 02:31:35,853
kind of head these off.

1666
02:31:37,274 --> 02:31:38,534
So that was my concern.

1667
02:31:38,574 --> 02:31:40,115
So setting precedent.

1668
02:31:40,175 --> 02:31:49,419
So how many buildings are under the same condition that then because we funded this particular project could come and say, well, we're in the same condition.

1669
02:31:49,459 --> 02:31:50,119
And don't get me wrong.

1670
02:31:50,159 --> 02:31:52,000
I mean, if it's an emergency, something needs to be done.

1671
02:31:53,981 --> 02:31:58,222
But we could be setting precedent here that then some of the buildings are in the same condition.

1672
02:31:58,242 --> 02:31:59,143
I don't know whether any.

1673
02:31:59,783 --> 02:32:02,364
But I think it's something worthwhile to take a look.

1674
02:32:02,404 --> 02:32:03,705
And again, if there's an emergency,

1675
02:32:04,781 --> 02:32:13,330
I will approve this tonight, but I think it requires further consideration, given that it's taxpayers' money, right?

1676
02:32:13,370 --> 02:32:17,354
So, and then the second part is that what are we getting in return after this?

1677
02:32:17,474 --> 02:32:24,461
So, because it says here, after this gets solved and the emergency gets addressed, which is the priority, I want to re-emphasize that.

1678
02:32:25,683 --> 02:32:37,216
It says the applicant will work with the Community Preservation Act manager to coordinate one to two public events annually for a 10-year period in which the project building at 92 High School will be open to the public.

1679
02:32:37,236 --> 02:32:43,503
So if it's a private building, what does it mean that the building will be open to the public?

1680
02:32:45,292 --> 02:32:46,793
And again, I'm not familiar with the building.

1681
02:32:46,833 --> 02:32:56,536
So I'm just asking questions as someone that as a resident that is concerned about how our taxpayers money is being used, and knows nothing about this building.

1682
02:32:56,696 --> 02:32:58,857
And obviously, I want to prioritize the emergency.

1683
02:32:58,877 --> 02:32:59,957
I'm going to repeat that.

1684
02:33:00,557 --> 02:33:02,178
But I'm worried about present.

1685
02:33:02,818 --> 02:33:06,119
And then I'm also worried about is just giving the money and then that's it?

1686
02:33:06,519 --> 02:33:08,100
Or is this a loan at zero interest?

1687
02:33:09,136 --> 02:33:10,558
Is this something else?

1688
02:33:13,561 --> 02:33:15,122
So those are my questions.

1689
02:33:15,262 --> 02:33:15,463
Thank you.

1690
02:33:15,483 --> 02:33:15,843
Thank you.

1691
02:33:15,903 --> 02:33:19,647
I mean, my understanding is this an appropriation, so the money would go directly to them.

1692
02:33:20,067 --> 02:33:22,650
I don't know if you want to add some information.

1693
02:33:22,950 --> 02:33:28,897
I just want to clarify the condition of the funding to open up the doors for public events.

1694
02:33:29,017 --> 02:33:29,898
They will be working

1695
02:33:30,398 --> 02:33:38,803
through me through the mayor's office on organizing, you know, the coffee and cookies visits with veterans office to open up their doors so that that is being posted there.

1696
02:33:38,823 --> 02:33:49,009
So effectively, just kind of making the building a little bit, having more of a direct public benefit beyond just having it be an asset of the city.

1697
02:33:51,170 --> 02:33:52,031
Councilor Scarpelli.

1698
02:33:53,780 --> 02:33:54,240
One second.

1699
02:33:55,121 --> 02:33:55,521
Go ahead.

1700
02:33:55,781 --> 02:33:56,061
I'm sorry.

1701
02:33:56,102 --> 02:33:57,342
I know you do so much work.

1702
02:33:57,362 --> 02:34:10,310
I know I brought this up in the past and your comment was that community preservation, the, I won't bring up what that location was, but you said it was part of the community and it was historical.

1703
02:34:10,350 --> 02:34:13,072
So, but again, I think that Ms.

1704
02:34:13,112 --> 02:34:14,213
Fiora brings up a good point.

1705
02:34:14,833 --> 02:34:35,237
that as we move forward, I think that, meaning that it's an emergency, and I feel that this is, as a person who supported the Community Preservation Act and understanding that saving these locations are very important, especially in the city of Medford, which is the key, I think that legally

1706
02:34:36,467 --> 02:34:45,849
If it starts getting into a slippery slope, I think that as we move forward, I just let you know that I'll be reaching out more in depth because I think that

1707
02:34:47,787 --> 02:34:48,948
Mr. Fiora brings up a good point.

1708
02:34:49,528 --> 02:35:04,297
If today is one thing, it could be another location with another home and a person can buy a historical home and say, well, I can't afford the windows, let me apply to the CPA and just assume you're gonna pay for the windows.

1709
02:35:04,978 --> 02:35:06,739
And I know that that's not the intent.

1710
02:35:06,779 --> 02:35:12,682
So again, I think that that's something that you've been working, you have your due diligence and you're doing your due diligence with that.

1711
02:35:13,183 --> 02:35:14,664
And I appreciate that.

1712
02:35:15,834 --> 02:35:16,515
share that with you.

1713
02:35:16,555 --> 02:35:19,719
So I think the component was the community piece.

1714
02:35:19,819 --> 02:35:20,880
So yes, thank you.

1715
02:35:21,301 --> 02:35:22,242
And thank you for your comments.

1716
02:35:22,262 --> 02:35:28,048
Yeah, but the community is not interested in funding private entities going forward.

1717
02:35:28,068 --> 02:35:33,415
This was just a very unique situation with a unique building for a relatively small ask.

1718
02:35:33,535 --> 02:35:35,437
So and again, within our

1719
02:35:36,137 --> 02:35:37,077
eligibility here.

1720
02:35:37,097 --> 02:35:38,278
We were very diligent on that.

1721
02:35:38,318 --> 02:35:43,700
We actually coursed this application over the two meetings just to really discuss it and have some.

1722
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:44,820
So it's not some thorough.

1723
02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:47,822
It wasn't so the public knows not taken out of thin air.

1724
02:35:47,862 --> 02:35:49,662
You didn't just make something arbitrarily.

1725
02:35:50,062 --> 02:35:52,983
It's in the bylaws and discussion aligns with that.

1726
02:35:53,004 --> 02:35:54,044
So thank you.

1727
02:35:54,284 --> 02:35:55,905
And I appreciate the commentary.

1728
02:35:56,485 --> 02:35:56,765
Truly.

1729
02:35:59,006 --> 02:35:59,266
Thank you.

1730
02:35:59,286 --> 02:36:04,588
We have any other questions for Councilor Tala and for Manager Dupont?

1731
02:36:07,009 --> 02:36:07,750
Did I just get promoted?

1732
02:36:07,810 --> 02:36:08,530
Oh, I'm a councilor.

1733
02:36:09,050 --> 02:36:10,932
Well, I just got you two confused.

1734
02:36:10,952 --> 02:36:12,453
I don't know how.

1735
02:36:15,255 --> 02:36:21,159

Vice President Callahan.

1740
02:36:28,765 --> 02:36:29,746
You've got no respect.

1741
02:36:30,206 --> 02:36:30,506
Yes.

1742
02:36:30,526 --> 02:36:33,869

1743
02:36:33,909 --> 02:36:33,989
Yes.

1744
02:36:36,293 --> 02:36:37,414
I just do what the clerk tells me.

1745
02:36:38,575 --> 02:36:39,135
Yes.
