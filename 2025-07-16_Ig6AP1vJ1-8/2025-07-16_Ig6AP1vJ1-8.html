    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=634.812s">Seven</a>  present, none absent, please rise to salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=650.443s">Announcements,</a>  accolades, remembrances, reports, and records, 25119 offered by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=656.646s">Be</a>  it resolved that we offer our deepest and sincerest condolences to the family of Brian Deeb Hilliard, a fixture in our community for almost 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=664.95s">Brian</a>  was a uniquely talented trumpet player who turned his musical skills into a successful music booking agency, occasional brass and strings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=672.714s">We</a>  offer our sympathies to Brian's wife, Stacey, his children, Duncan and Owen, his extended family, and his many friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=678.497s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=682.125s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=683.326s">I</a>  thank a fellow clerk that also was instrumental in getting this, putting this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=694.653s">When</a>  you hear passing of members of our community and when they get to a certain age, you realize that you wish they lived a good life and they're moving on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=705.1s">But</a>  when you heard that Mr. Hilliard passed, it hit you right in the gut. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=712.756s">I've</a>  known him as a dad and as a resident, and everybody knew him as a giving musician, and everybody talks about his trumpet playing and the impact he's left in the music community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=727.079s">But</a>  more importantly, it's what he left back as a husband and a dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=733.181s">Very</a>  close to my children's age, and Owen and Duncan, and it's something that <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=740.34s">We</a>  want to thank Brian for his commitment and love of Medford and his commitment to his family, his wife, Stacey. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=751.243s">This</a>  is something that we've said it often when we lose some community members, but Brian Hillard's passing will definitely be forever missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=764.647s">So</a>  I send the deepest condolences to Owen, Duncan, and Stacey. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=771.174s">We,</a>  if we ever, if they ever need anything, we should be there for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=777.198s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=778.879s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarapelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=779.92s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=783.922s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarapelli for putting this on the agenda and for your kind words. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=790.747s">It's</a>  a difficult moment for the Hilliard family and I want to send my deepest condolences as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=796.811s">I</a>  went to school at Duncan and <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=802.335s">It's</a>  tough to say anything because I think it hits particularly hard when it's a family of someone you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=816.58s">I</a>  think I just want to send my best thoughts and recognize Mr. Hilliard's really wonderful life and legacy, his wonderful family. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=831.668s">I</a>  think it's hard for me to gather my thoughts, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=838.1s">You</a>  know, it does come as, you know, a shock to the community, especially, I think, I know a lot of us were at the Memorial Day event recently, and Mr. Hilliard played some really beautiful, moving music there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=853.472s">And</a>  I just wanna, you know, say on the behalf of Benford City Council that we send our deepest condolences to the family.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=865.621s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=866.401s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=869.029s">Thank</a>  you, I wanted to share that I heard about Mr. Hilliard's passing from the Medford Boat Club, sent out an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=880.499s">I'm</a>  a member of the boat club. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=881.66s">He</a>  was a very active member and he organized the Hawaiian night and just his family was very active and continue to be very active. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=893.771s">So</a>  on behalf of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=895.759s">book</a>  club community, he'll be hugely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=898.441s">It's</a>  really a huge tragedy and I'm so sorry for his family and for the whole city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=905.005s">It's</a>  never easy and our hearts go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=910.929s">So</a>  best wishes to his family. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=913.01s">I</a>  hope they can get through this difficult time.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=917.914s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=918.294s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=919.114s">I</a>  remember Mr. Hilliard, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=925.198s">played</a>  at the Memorial Day Ceremony, the Patriots Day Ceremony. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=928.959s">And</a>  this one, it kind of closed home for me because my dad, he's a professional trumpet player. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=935.561s">And</a>  so anytime I see a trumpet player there representing the community, the musicians, I take note of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=945.584s">Went</a>  up to Mr. Hilliard, had a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=948.565s">I</a>  wanted to get to know him better. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=953.292s">So</a>  when I saw that, when I saw he passed away, it was a shock. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=959.254s">Every</a>  community needs its musicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=961.654s">Every</a>  community needs people there to play taps. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=966.276s">Every</a>  community needs music and without Mr. Hilliard, Medford's lost that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=974.638s">So</a>  my condolences to his family and thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this resolution.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=983.593s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=985.755s">It</a>  looks like we do have one comment from a member of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=989.798s">I</a>  recognize Bill Giglio, you have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=993.341s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1037.665s">Hey,</a>  could we have your name and address for the record please?</p>

exceed nine on the premises. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1754.6s">We</a>  went before the Board of Appeals in June of 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1758.141s">The</a>  property is located in a C1 district that allows for new sales, but not for used vehicle sales. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1767.804s">We</a>  obtained a used variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1772.865s">On</a>  the basis that the property is a 31,000-square-foot parcel of land, there's an 8,300-square-foot building that houses the repair and auto body shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1782.37s">The</a>  remaining portion of the premises is a substantial yard area where there would be the ability to park up to nine used vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1793.175s">for</a>  sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1794.015s">The</a>  petitioner proposes to provide a limited number for sale on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1799.336s">Presently</a>  there's 25 exterior parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1802.817s">It's</a>  anticipated that the average number of vehicles that he would have at any one time on the property would be six vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1810.659s">He</a>  is engaged in the auto body repair shop, which is a requirement for a class two dealership that you have <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1816.86s">somewhere</a>  where the vehicles can be brought for warranty work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1820.363s">As</a>  part of his auto body business, he frequently has customers that, for one reason or another, don't want to spend the money to have their car fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1829.269s">And</a>  he would have the opportunity, if those cars were still viable, to purchase those and put them on sale, probably less expensive used cars for the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1839.516s">In</a>  addition, he deals with people whose cars have been totaled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1843.218s">and</a>  don't have a vehicle and this would provide him again with an opportunity to provide those people with a used vehicle for them to purchase. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1855.858s">As</a>  indicated, we were able to get a use variance for that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1860.862s">At</a>  the time, we had a number of neighbors to the property which were in favor of the variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1868.648s">Neighbors</a>  very close. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1869.929s">They</a>  have their cars repaired there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1872.391s">Obie's</a>  Auto Collision has a five-star review for <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1878.536s">He's</a>  been in business in the city for five years previous to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1882.699s">He</a>  worked for Fantasia. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1884.881s">Part</a>  of the restrictions that we discussed with the Board of Appeals is that he is not going to change the hours of operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1891.727s">So</a>  there will be no weekend and night operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1894.329s">It's</a>  going to be a 9 to 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1895.59s">I</a>  believe it's 9 to 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1896.631s">It</a>  might be 8 to 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1898.513s">operation</a>  Monday through Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1899.994s">There's</a>  no additional salesperson that are being introduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1904.456s">There's</a>  going to be no advertising on site or vehicles in the front of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1909.88s">It's</a>  only basically internet sales and then sales to existing customers who are looking for a modest second-hand car in instances where they might be desperate because their car's been totaled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1922.728s">And</a>  he has, you know, in order to do this type of thing, if we weren't granted the use variance, then he would have to move to another location. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1929.831s">And</a>  it just doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1931.351s">He's</a>  got his auto business there with the repair station right on site to deal with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=1936.433s">And</a>  again, we're only looking for a limited number of vehicles, not to exceed nine.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2119.79s">Thank</a>  you, City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2120.671s">So</a>  let me just introduce myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2123.113s">My</a>  name is Greg Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2124.734s">I</a>  purchased my first house in Medford in 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2128.537s">My</a>  grandfather grew up on Forest Street during World War II, and so Medford's always kind of been a theme in my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2137.625s">Love</a>  the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2140.247s">So</a>  I'm building a house on Walcott Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2144.718s">Part</a>  of the construction, we bumped out part of the front where the existing driveway was. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2152.164s">And</a>  so essentially, in the plans, we have to have the driveway go up along the left side of the house where there's 10 feet of clearance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2162.633s">And</a>  so there is a tree currently on that side of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2175.17s">And</a>  so I would like to go through the process through the DPPW to remove the tree, go through the public hearing process, see if the public has any, you know, objection to moving the tree so that we can put in a driveway so that the family can functionally live in this house. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2197.154s">And</a>  so my understanding and what's on the website is that <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2205.09s">Trees</a>  cannot be removed unless the tree warden or the deputy deems the tree unhealthy or dead or approved through a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2214.792s">Public</a>  hearings are requested in writing to the tree warden. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2219.813s">So</a>  I requested this hearing back in early May. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2224.113s">Excuse</a>  me, I have a whole list of dates, but I'll just try to summarize it for you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2233.376s">I</a>  talked to Aggie about having the hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2236.418s">She</a>  said it was okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2237.298s">She</a>  explained, okay, well, we're gonna take the circumference of the tree if the public doesn't have any objection to it, and we'll have to plant four to six more trees in the neighborhood if we take the tree down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2251.985s">And</a>  that sounds fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2254.087s">I'm</a>  fine with paying for the new trees and going through the public hearing process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2257.808s">That</a>  seems like a fair trade-off. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2262.735s">So</a>  this all started back in May and really there's just this long period of silence from the DPW and Aggie and you know I'm trying to be very patient because I understand that you know there's reasons for some of the delays. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2279.992s">I'm</a>  trying to be very cordial but I was really basically ignored up until <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2285.237s">July</a>  10th, I finally got an attorney to reach out to the mayor's office to say, what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2290.48s">Like,</a>  they're not responding to my emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2292.321s">I</a>  go to the office, they tell me that, oh, I'm gonna get a call back, nothing, just silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2299.845s">And</a>  so, all I'm asking for is what's on the Medford City website to have a public hearing to see if anyone has any objection to removing the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2313.508s">If</a>  there's objection from a public, then that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2316.609s">But</a>  that's how the democratic process works. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2320.229s">And</a>  I'd be fine with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2321.529s">But</a>  all I'm asking for is to go through that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2325.69s">And</a>  it appears that the tree warden and the DPW is just not worth their time to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2333.392s">And</a>  so I'm just here to bring that to the council and just let you guys know that <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2341.589s">You</a>  know, I'm a member of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2343.089s">I</a>  demand, you know, I should have the same respect as anyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2348.831s">And</a>  I would just like to have some guidance on this.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2355.693s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2356.513s">I'll</a>  recognize Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2357.733s">And</a>  then I did receive an email from the DPW commissioner on this matter that I can read.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2361.354s">I</a>  yield to you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2363.705s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2365.385s">So</a>  thanks for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2366.626s">Appreciate</a>  your petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2368.726s">As</a>  you probably know, considering you've been going through this for a few months, the public shade tree and the public hearings are governed by mass general law. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2377.268s">And</a>  the council doesn't have a role in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2378.849s">But</a>  of course, you know, we do hear from folks in this space about many things that are going on in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2384.93s">I'm</a>  going to read this response. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2386.911s">It</a>  is not <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2388.295s">My,</a>  uh, it's not coming from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2390.577s">It's</a>  coming from the DPW commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2392.96s">He</a>  wrote me after the agenda went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2395.002s">Good</a>  morning, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2396.383s">I</a>  wanted to bring to your attention information regarding the issue with Mr. Greg Collins and the public tree that is on your agenda for next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2403.812s">Mr.</a>  Collins has not granted a permit from the tree warden to remove a public shade tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2408.016s">He</a>  would like a hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2408.997s">However,</a>  hearings are required when a permit is issued to remove or take down a public shade tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2413.742s">Despite</a>  his claims, the tree warden has been responsive to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2416.584s">It</a>  is also worth noting that the building project began prior to the proponent receiving plan approval at the engineering division for elements such as the ROW curb cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2425.834s">Unfortunately,</a>  the desired driveway for the project would eliminate a tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2429.317s">The</a>  proponent asked to remove the tree, and the tree warden said no, denying the permission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2433.42s">Typically,</a>  site plans are approved at the engineering division prior to building, and especially if there are new curb cut locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2440.265s">Mr.</a>  Collins is now represented by an attorney, and the communication has moved from the DPW to the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2445.488s">I</a>  hope this helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2446.789s">Regards,</a>  Tim. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2448.951s">I</a>  can recognize Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2457.003s">you</a>  know, if that answer isn't efficient or it doesn't, then I'll gladly reach out to you tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2466.371s">I'll</a>  call the city solicitor myself and see if there's a way we can help, so.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2472.897s">Like,</a>  you know, weeks or months ago, all I was looking for was for some kind of response from the DPW commissioner from Aggie. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2481.18s">But</a>  like I said, it was just silence for months. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2484.161s">And</a>  I'm trying to, you know, I was trying to be very patient with everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2487.831s">But</a>  I haven't even heard that from the commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2489.873s">So</a>  now I'm hearing it for the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2492.755s">So</a>  again, I'll talk to my attorney and see what I can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2495.377s">And</a>  first and foremost, I want to be continuing to be having a good relationship with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2501.702s">I</a>  plan on having my house here for many years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2507.066s">So</a>  it's important to me that I have a good relationship with everyone and hope we can get this sorted out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2514.051s">And</a>  that's it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2517.244s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2517.604s">I</a>  appreciate your time coming down and Councilor Scarpelli as well for your offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2526.334s">Continuing</a>  in public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2530.038s">If</a>  you'd like to speak in public participation, you'll have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2533.401s">You</a>  can raise your hand on Zoom or come to the podium in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2536.725s">We</a>  will alternate between the podium and Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2548.733s">Hi</a>  there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2549.414s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2550.896s">And</a>  you'll have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2552.098s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2552.779s">My</a>  name is Rahma, but I'm here on behalf of SEIU 32BJ and our member Maria is going to read a short statement and then I'll translate it in English.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2564.757s">mi</a>  nombre es maria coto limpia la escuela secundaria medford intermedia durante 10 años disfruté mi trabajo y estaba orgullosa de proporcionar un ambiente de aprendizaje limpio y sanitario para los estudiantes de medford mis compañeras de trabajo y yo teníamos salarios justos beneficios y condiciones laborales bajo un contrato sindical con <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2589.552s">S-E-I-U-32-B-J.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2592.134s">Sin</a>  embargo, el distrito ahora ha concedido su contrato de limpieza a una nueva empresa llamada Partners Facility Solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2601.702s">Es</a>  una empresa no sindical que se negó a contratarme a mí y a mis compañeras de trabajo a pesar de varios intentos de postular el sindicato. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2613.352s">Ha</a>  presentado una denuncia <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2617.015s">I'll</a>  read quickly.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2640.658s">My</a>  name is Maria Cotto and I cleaned Medford High School and McGlynn Middle School for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2646.08s">I</a>  enjoyed my work and was proud to provide a clear and sanitary learning environment for Medford students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2651.701s">My</a>  co-workers and I had fair wages, benefits, and working conditions under a union contract with SEIU 32BJ. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2659.163s">However</a>  the district has now awarded its janitorial contract to a new company called Partners Facility Solutions, which is a non-union company that refused to hire me and my co-workers despite several attempts to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2672.005s">The</a>  union has filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board alleging the partners refusing to hire us because we are part of a union. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2680.327s">The</a>  City of Medford should do the right thing and choose a responsible contractor for the next school year that will respect our union and our work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2687.848s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2690.682s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2691.342s">Is</a>  there anything else you'd like to add with your additional time?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2695.464s">I</a>  think, I don't think so.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2697.565s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2699.205s">Thank</a>  you for speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2700.126s">Is</a>  there any councilors who'd like to say anything at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2707.308s">Go</a>  to Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2711.815s">I</a>  am very sorry to hear about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2716.097s">I</a>  want my city to be a pro-union city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2718.598s">I</a>  think the janitorial staff should be union members. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2723.9s">So</a>  I will certainly do what I can to look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2729.786s">clearly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2731.447s">City</a>  is not the purview of the City Council exactly, but I really appreciate you coming here and bringing your stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2739.553s">And</a>  it definitely is something that we can have an impact on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2742.695s">So</a>  let's see what we can do.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2744.496s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2745.176s">I</a>  think that this is alarming because</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2759.204s">If</a>  not, most of all of our employees that work for the city and our active custodians are all members of the union. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2765.549s">And</a>  I think having organized labor, you can see what's happening across the country right now and making sure that our community is supported through labor and making sure that initiatives that come up, it's for the benefit of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2780.099s">And</a>  that's why we support our union. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2783.102s">So</a>  I find this very disturbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2786.044s">So</a>  I think that this is, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2787.919s">You</a>  know, everything talks about cost cutting, but having union employees and having our employees represented and protected, I think, speaks volumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2799.347s">So,</a>  for one, Councilor, if there's something I can do, I will definitely reach out and, you know, see what we can do to support <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2809.461s">your</a>  organization in moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2812.363s">If</a>  I gather, I know that we've been reaching out to see even with to this non-union company to be hired, they're not even coming, getting back to you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2819.568s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2820.249s">Our</a>  members have replied numerous times. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2822.23s">In</a>  fact, it has occurred there's a charge with the National Labor Relations Board because of their refusal to hire our members, and we believe that's purely because they're union members.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2837.501s">Well,</a>  and again, that's what happens now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2839.803s">There's</a>  a greedy person at the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2842.184s">He's</a>  benefiting from the people that are getting their butts kicked every day doing the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2847.468s">And</a>  I think that's why unions balance that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2851.73s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President, but I look forward to working with you to make sure that it's rectified. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2856.253s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2857.054s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2857.594s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2860.144s">Yeah,</a>  I'd like to echo the sentiments that my colleagues just offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2865.349s">I'd</a>  also just like to encourage you to follow up later so that we can do what we can do behind the scenes and at a council meeting to help out with the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2878.621s">I'm</a>  not pleased to hear about this, and thank you for coming out here and speaking.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2885.71s">Thank</a>  you, yeah, and I will communicate to the superintendent that we heard from you tonight and ask for a response.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2892.808s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2904.377s">We're</a>  still in public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2906.919s">If</a>  you'd like to speak in public participation, you can come to the podium or make a line behind the podium and raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2913.343s">Seeing</a>  no hands on Zoom, we'll go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2915.444s">Name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2916.525s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2917.145s">Sharon</a>  Diesso, corner of Circuit Road and Mass Ave in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2923.223s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2925.024s">It's</a>  nice to see everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2926.305s">What's</a>  concerned matters, even in this dire heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2929.386s">I</a>  just have a quick question for those who may have come in a little late, and I'm a little confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2934.029s">Many</a>  of us have been following the zoning news, but the public hearing on zoning news at the beginning of tonight's meeting, President Beas, was postponed to September 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2945.495s">Now,</a>  the board is meeting, I think, one more time in August and then September 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2950.437s">So</a>  do we have to wait until you like rebuttal with them and then we can participate on comments, wait until September 9, because you have another motion on the agenda this evening regarding zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2963.792s">So</a>  when we'll be able to comment ourselves on items that we have reviewed.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2970.627s">Sure,</a>  so there are three active zoning amendment proposals currently under consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2977.15s">One</a>  is the residential districts and ADUs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2980.531s">That</a>  was referred to the Community Development Board in, I want to say March, and they've had several public hearings on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2988.315s">Their</a>  last public hearing was last week, and they're having another one in early August. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2993.917s">for</a>  the residential and ADU proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2997.719s">And</a>  I believe the comment deadline for the written comment is July 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3002.322s">That's</a>  the deadline that they have set for written comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3006.344s">And</a>  I believe they have said that on August 5th, they will be deliberating, but they won't be hearing public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3011.907s">And</a>  they will be directing the planning consultant to draft a new set of recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3018.49s">Once</a>  that's done, they're going to hold further public hearings in September and October before referring recommendations back to the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3027.092s">That's</a>  on the residential and the accessory dwelling units proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3031.234s">The</a>  proposal that was on our agenda tonight that was delayed till September is a public hearing on Medford Square and West Medford Square zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3039.936s">the</a>  CD board had a meeting on that proposal, I think the last week of June and maybe discussed it further last week and they have to continue to hold public hearings before making recommendations to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3054.524s">We</a>  can't take action until we receive recommendations from the community development board or the community development board chooses not to make a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3062.868s">So</a>  that's why we had to delay the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3064.809s">We</a>  don't have recommendations, so we can't take action. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3068.011s">The</a>  third proposal is the proposal for what's called other corridors that consists of Broadway, Boston Avenue, High Street, Harvard Street, and Main Street, various kind of mixed-use lots on those streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3084.885s">And</a>  the CD board has requested that we hold off on referring that to them until at least our August 5th meeting, so that was tabled.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3092.083s">Okay</a>  so when would the residential be reviewed again because we had the meeting before the last one had one way of thinking and the last one there were many more people who have been informed so I really really urge anyone if they can think of another way besides internet communication for many people who will be affected especially older people <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3115.002s">that</a>  we need to get some sort of a flyer, besides stuffing it in a tax bill, because that precludes renters, and it also precludes business lessees, you know who don't know that this is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3127.275s">Thanks</a>  a lot.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3128.296s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3130.658s">I</a>  see a Maria on zoom Maria I'll go to you name and address for the record and you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_42]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3137.643s">I</a>  just wanted to double check. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3139.663s">Did</a>  you say the values aligned local investments ordinance is deferred to September the 9th?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3147.285s">The</a>  investments ordinance is tabled to the next regular meeting on August 5th.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3162.601s">Roy</a>  Belson, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, a longtime member of the Jewish community, and a former employee of the Medford Public Schools for 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3171.707s">I'm</a>  here to speak tonight on the proposed ordinance that you did lay on the table, but I believe I have some words to say that I would like to have heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3180.373s">So</a>  good evening, Mr. President, members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3184.456s">The</a>  role of city government is to focus on the welfare and betterment of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3190.525s">As</a>  individuals, you always have the right to advocate for issues in the international arena. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3196.468s">As</a>  a local governmental body representing a diverse community, you need to promote harmony, not create friction and fragmentation over an issue that is not your mandate and well beyond your capacity to significantly influence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3211.556s">Words</a>  carry meaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3214.198s">The</a>  old saw that sticks and stones may break bones, but words will never harm me is very misleading. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3221.042s">Sometimes</a>  words are sharper than a sword. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3225.064s">All</a>  you have to do is study social media or be bombarded with campaigns of disinformation to realize that words can lead to severe negative outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3236.65s">To</a>  paraphrase, the road to disaster is often paved with good intentions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3243.634s">Do</a>  not let your zeal to advance your ideals blind you to adverse impacts your actions can and will create. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3251.4s">The</a>  issues in the Middle East are not just contemporary, but are hundreds of years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3257.702s">The</a>  causes and circumstances are complex, and the resolution has been defying even the most honorable peace brokers amidst the actions of multiple terrorist groups and partisan fanatics. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3270.326s">You</a>  don't have to agree with all of Israeli policies and practices to recognize the Israelis' right to exist, but to recognize the urgent need to eliminate any possibility <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3281.697s">of</a>  anti-Semitism in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3284.698s">Recently,</a>  think about the young couple in Washington, Yaron and Sarah, who were gunned down leaving the Israeli embassy by a man screaming, free Palestine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3295.903s">And</a>  11 days later, think about what happened in Boulder, Colorado, when a man yelling, free Palestine, threw a Molotov cocktail at peaceful marchers calling for the release of hostages. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3307.557s">Think</a>  about Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who barely escaped with his family a fire in his home started by another man calling to free Palestine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3317.301s">I</a>  could go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3319.062s">Don't</a>  think for a moment it couldn't happen here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3323.584s">We</a>  are as vulnerable as any other Jewish American community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3328.387s">The</a>  proposed ordinances are performative at best. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3333.229s">Passage</a>  will not alter the international reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3336.983s">Any</a>  study of BDS has not proven effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3340.386s">Massachusetts</a>  law and practice makes implementation of such a proposal impractical and not in the best financial interests of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3353.618s">You</a>  already passed a resolution in February of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3357.502s">Will</a>  you accept accountability if anti-Semitic violence happens in our community? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3364.48s">Don't</a>  delude the Palestinian supporters in our community that such an ordinance can even be enforced. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3371.085s">Don't</a>  subject the Jewish citizens in our community to a greater threat of hate and violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3376.59s">It</a>  can happen here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3379.412s">Instead,</a>  demonstrate real leadership by rejecting performative votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3385.177s">Yes,</a>  you can preserve and advance your values and concerns much better by promoting community dialogue, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3392.863s">by</a>  bringing citizens together, by promoting understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3397.49s">Council</a>  business has many challenges and you know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3400.894s">Focus</a>  on what you can do to better unify the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3405.241s">Thank</a>  you for listening.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3406.863s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3412.104s">Seeing</a>  no hands on zoom will stay at the podium name and address for the record please give three minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3416.908s">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3418.549s">My</a>  name is Mike Cohen, I am you guys hear me okay, we can hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3422.152s">Yeah,</a>  I live at 200 Brooke Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3424.914s">And</a>  so I'm here tonight, not as a foreign policy expert because, well, frankly, that's not <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3431.038s">what</a>  we should be talking about here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3432.478s">I'm</a>  here as a concerned resident, and I'm here because something doesn't sit right and that so called values alignment investment ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3440.16s">Now</a>  it sounds righteous, I get it but it really crosses a lot of moral and civic lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3446.821s">And</a>  let's be honest, you know you guys do a lot and I respect what the city council does, but certainly foreign policy that's not in the city charter, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3458.585s">This</a>  ordinance, it goes out of its way not to mention Israel, but we know what it really does. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3464.33s">It</a>  unmistakably targets it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3466.372s">It's</a>  a dramatic overreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3468.093s">Worse,</a>  it's a distraction. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3469.735s">It's</a>  like parks and recreation issuing a position on nuclear disarmament. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3474.619s">What's</a>  gonna happen there? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3475.38s">Not</a>  much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3475.96s">It's</a>  not in your lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3478.903s">And</a>  I don't wanna kid ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3480.124s">The</a>  omission of Israel doesn't make this ordinance more neutral. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3483.827s">It</a>  makes it more insidious. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3486.182s">It</a>  pretends to be about human rights, but it holds one country, that little country that so they do everything wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3493.488s">The</a>  only Jewish state, the singular, they hold them to a singular and impossible standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3498.853s">And</a>  that's not a principled stance, it's a targeted one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3502.656s">Now</a>  we know how antisemitism morphs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3504.798s">If</a>  you look at history, it's slippery. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3508.164s">First</a>  it was about religion, then race. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3511.228s">Now</a>  it's politics and policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3513.631s">The</a>  justifications change, the target don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3517.896s">We</a>  see it, we know it, we won't ignore it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3520.62s">And</a>  let's not kid ourselves, do not alienate or scapegoat Jewish people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3523.824s">We</a>  won't stand for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3525.984s">The</a>  ordinance doesn't help anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3528.105s">It</a>  doesn't advance peace, it doesn't save lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3531.206s">What</a>  it does do is single out Israel and by extension Jewish people under the guise of justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3536.429s">But</a>  justice that only applies to one group, that's not justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3539.77s">That's</a>  biased with the press release. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3543.352s">I</a>  know in a lot of circles it's fashionable to be anti-Israel, but it doesn't make it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3548.741s">So</a>  I urge you all, ladies and gentlemen, please stay focused on your mission, fix what's local, fund what matters, and please don't turn the city into a billboard for a one-sided device foreign policy statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3562.131s">Thank</a>  you for your time, folks.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3563.673s">Thank</a>  you for your comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3564.513s">I'm</a>  going to go to Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3572.499s">We</a>  have Micah Kesselman on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3574.361s">Micah,</a>  name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3576.042s">You'll</a>  have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3579.113s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3579.353s">Can</a>  you hear me?</p>

    <p>[Micah Kesselman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3580.753s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3581.974s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3582.334s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3582.514s">My</a>  name is Micah Kesselman. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3583.474s">I</a>  live at 499 Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3586.535s">I</a>  was not going to make any comments tonight, but I just want to respond to some of the things that have already been said. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3593.616s">Let's</a>  understand for everyone here that that is making comments against the ethical investment ordinance or values aligned investment ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3603.439s">This</a>  was brought <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3605.307s">to</a>  the city council by a cross-section of people who live in Medford from various parts of the community that are concerned about the way that we invest our money and finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3619.022s">It</a>  is fundamentally about how a city invests the money and how it exercises the controls that it is allowed to under mass general laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3631.705s">That</a>  is a fundamentally local issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3634.965s">And</a>  not only is it a local issue, it's a local issue that was brought forward by residents of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3639.466s">Nowhere</a>  does it say Israel in specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3643.167s">It</a>  refers to human rights violations, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3647.555s">Myanmar,</a>  Saudi Arabia, various other countries which might be found to be under it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3653.859s">No</a>  one is out there saying that it's against Asians or against Saudis or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3664.364s">Moreover,</a>  I want people to really think about what they're saying when they're implying, imputing <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3671.537s">anti-semitism</a>  in an ordinance that doesn't even directly attack like go after Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3679.482s">You</a>  are equivocating issues with a state to be issues with a people with an ethnicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3688.989s">That</a>  is dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3690.59s">We</a>  just saw in the last few days <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3695.013s">The</a>  Elmo incident on social media where someone hacked the account and was spewing horrible anti-Semitic things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3703.94s">Notice</a>  what they were doing, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3705.741s">They</a>  were basing that call on that equivocation between Judaism and Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3715.857s">It</a>  is dangerous to equivocate the two, and by doing what a lot of you guys are doing, you are feeding into that equivocation narrative, which is dangerous for me and my fellow Jews in the community, and more so that makes me really angry and hard for me to keep it down, is that it makes it dangerous for my son. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3736.773s">for</a>  my children and my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3739.274s">So</a>  stop equivocating anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism or a-Zionism or diasporism. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3748.758s">It's</a>  dangerous to all of us.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3754.48s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3756.261s">Thank</a>  you for your comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3759.443s">We'll</a>  go back to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3760.623s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3761.904s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3763.503s">Hello,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3764.164s">My</a>  name is Max embarrassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3765.505s">I</a>  live at 30 review Beach Parkway from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3768.587s">I'd</a>  like to start just by making some personal comments that I like to read out a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3774.391s">For</a>  one thing I want to address some of the points that were also recently just made. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3780.215s">A</a>  lot of the language that is used within paragraph D of the values ordinance is particularly politically charged. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3789.323s">It's</a>  quite provocative, and it is undoubtedly taking advantage of a lot of the things that people might come to mind due to the discourse that is kind of self propagated throughout <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3802.734s">online</a>  culture nowadays. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3804.595s">A</a>  lot of that language that's quite provocative and debatable and often contested includes the words of apartheid genocide ethnic cleansing and everyone gets very riled up when they, when they see these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3819.288s">I'd</a>  like to make some personal comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3821.748s">I'm</a>  a homeowner and a taxpaying Medford resident of five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3826.589s">I'd</a>  like to voice my opposition to the inclusion of paragraph D in the Medford values aligned local investment ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3834.431s">I</a>  actually support paragraphs A, B, C, and E, and I think that the majority of people here do, but we cannot beat around the bush of the fact that the language in paragraph D is lifted <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3846.933s">quite</a>  directly from a lot of the guidelines and narratives pushed by the Boycott, Divest and Sanction movement, and that is undoubtedly targeted at Israel in the use of this language. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3859.215s">And</a>  it often hides behind this cloud of ambiguity of, you know, we could apply this to many different nations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3867.497s">And</a>  while we can have all of those discussions, it's obviously going to be targeted at Israel at the point of this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3878.002s">I</a>  also don't believe that the language in the particular paragraph that we're discussing particularly to the city of Medford is in the budgetary interests of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3888.191s">A</a>  lot of them would involve divesting from companies that are incredibly useful to invest in incredibly profitable some of the most successful companies in America. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3897.76s">being</a>  speaking with about some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3900.684s">But</a>  I also don't think it agrees with the city's narratives of fairness. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3905.531s">You</a>  know, we have these values as Americans that we all want to, you know, support equal justice, equal rights, but a lot of what <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3914.463s">people</a>  are going to feel as a result is a tangible result of passing this ordinance is going to cause real harm to the Jewish community of Medford and it would create a domino effect to the greater rest of the Commonwealth and to the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3926.285s">It</a>  is going to make Jewish residents, Israeli residents of Medford and around Massachusetts feel unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3933.566s">And</a>  with that, I'd like to read out loud a letter that was sent to the city council by the American Jewish committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3943.069s">I</a>  urge the city council, unless I don't have the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3946.37s">Well,</a>  ultimately, some of the companies that are listed here are, you know, Apple Nvidia Hewitt Packard Intel, these companies, they <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3956.407s">are</a>  incredibly useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3957.727s">At</a>  the same time, if you're going to abstract the language to other countries, there are countries that we also would probably have a lot of trouble divesting from, namely China. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3969.291s">Some</a>  of our most successful companies are investing in China. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3973.853s">And</a>  those things are simply just not going to be feasible at the city level for us to really divest from. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3982.576s">And</a>  it wouldn't be budgetarily effective for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3986.097s">I'll</a>  skip on the letter, but I have been aware that it's been delivered to your inboxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3991.381s">I</a>  do encourage you to read this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3993.103s">So</a>

    <p>[Nick Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4006.56s">Nick</a>  Julio 40 Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4008.623s">So,</a>  while I'm glad that we're not going to be taking a vote tonight on the value aligned ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4014.43s">I</a>  do think that decision to table discussion on it was pretty cowardly given there's an obvious presence, people here who are going to speak against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4024.423s">applaud</a>  the Councilor who voted against the motion table as well as moved to take public comment out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4033.828s">So</a>  people do have that opportunity to voice their thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4036.969s">My</a>  comments, which I'm going to be discussing, we're assuming that we would be having that discussion tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4042.572s">So</a>  forgive me if they're a little off and some to some extent, but <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4046.914s">I'm</a>  very disappointed that, looking at the draft of the ordinance between the last public meeting and this one, that exactly zero changes were made, zero edits, despite extensive public comment at the last meeting from many people, including myself, who were critical of the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4066.682s">Speaking</a>  just for me, I pointed out that subsection D of section 2-697, that's the part on divesting from human rights abusers, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4076.062s">is</a>  very disturbingly vague, and I've yet to receive an answer to the question I asked for the record at the last meeting on this, you know who makes a determination that a company or entity has severely violated, quoting from the ordinances drafted human rights and international humanitarian law as determined by international legal <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4095.816s">Humanities</a>  bodies, including the United Nations, unquote, maybe it's implied that this would be the treasurer, based on the next section of the draft, but is the treasurer at all qualified to make this determination does she have a degree in international relations does she have a degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4111.875s">uh,</a>  in or is she an international law attorney? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4114.578s">I</a>  mean, I call on all of you to ask the treasurer the next discussion to come here and actually provide some information as to will they be qualified at all to make these determinations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4125.871s">The</a>  ordinance calls for if the ordinance <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4129.075s">or</a>  were to be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4130.796s">So</a>  since it remains completely unchanged between the last meeting and this one, I have to oppose it in its entirety. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4135.98s">I</a>  think the vagueness and the overbreath is just going to open the door to political abuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4140.824s">And</a>  I definitely agree, this will include targeting based on religious affiliation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4145.548s">So</a>  an absolute minimum, I'd hope the council, when this comes up again, would strike subsection D entirely. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4152.539s">If</a>  they're not willing to do that, you definitely should not approve this ordinance until that language is made more specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4159.285s">I</a>  would ask, which companies and entities do you wanna sanction? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4162.568s">Name</a>  them explicitly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4164.249s">If</a>  that includes the entire country of Israel, don't hide the ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4167.792s">Some</a>  of you have made it very clear your legislative intent is to target Israel, but at least own up to that and hear what the public has to say in response. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4176.119s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4179.162s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4181.817s">We</a>  will go to Zachary Chertok on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4185.28s">Zachary,</a>  name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4186.962s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Zachary Chertok]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4188.824s">Zachary</a>  Chertok, 5 Almont Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4192.067s">I</a>  want to echo some of the financial and community concerns as well as the BDS concerns in Section D. I've talked to a lot of folks in the investor VC and PE communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4205.385s">that</a>  I know professionally and I've worked with both inside and outside the Jewish community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4208.908s">They</a>  have both, they've all emphatically stated that the broad language used in this ordinance, not just in section D, but across the rest of it, will deter them from advising their portfolio companies to come anywhere near Medford in favor of more surrounding communities that don't target very severe restrictive financial measures in this case. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4228.985s">Similarly,</a>  I have put in comments and memoranda to the city council as well as the mayor's office <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4234.392s">asking</a>  for if any financial or legal evaluation has been done as to the risks that this exposes the city to as well as the constraints and have not heard anything definitive back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4245.078s">External</a>  analysis with colleagues out of Columbia SIPA have definitively noted that the broad language in here will basically severely restrict the city's ability to use investments as a non-tax source of revenue, basically rendering one of the only assets available as CDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4261.581s">Um,</a>  which according to section 55 in the mass general laws is not in the best financial interest of the city, um, towards maximum achievable returns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4269.385s">Furthermore,</a>  I will echo the sentiments, uh, by Mr. Jaleo before me that, um, it's not really definitively clear as to whether the person who is tasked as being responsible with executing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4281.132s">Being</a>  the treasurer collector that they have the necessary FINRA financial or CPA certifications to be able to execute or provide this kind of financial advisory service. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4291.549s">And</a>  I would ask that the language be tightened up significantly and that we see a better updated draft that reflects several of the concerns here tonight, including my own sent to you and now spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4301.614s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4311.419s">Barbara</a>  Rutstein, 16 Interrail Avenue, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4318.242s">I'm</a>  scared. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4320.527s">You</a>  have made me scared. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4325.229s">I'm</a>  not speaking on the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4327.629s">I'm</a>  talking to you as a Jewish person who has been in Medford for over 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4333.071s">I've</a>  served on the Conservation Commission, the Recycling Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4337.613s">I'm</a>  a supporter of the library, Chevalier, M-Belt. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4342.395s">I</a>  don't, I have just been here for a while and never really been scared <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4350.702s">to</a>  be Jewish. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4353.743s">But</a>  at the Embell picnic this past Saturday, I saw some bumper stickers on one car that was quite upsetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4367.407s">And</a>  one of them was a trope. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4371.152s">that</a>  was used in Germany about Jews ruling the world, but in this case it didn't say Jews ruled the world, it said America is ruled by Zionists. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4385.662s">Now</a>  you ask many, many people <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4389.714s">and</a>  they are probably going to tell you that to them, there's no splitting of hairs or threading the needle, that there's no difference between Zionism and Judaism, Israelis, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4404.159s">So</a>  I am scared. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4407.66s">Two</a>  years ago, through the Jingle Bell Festival, my house was on the house tour because they had never had a house decorated for Hanukkah. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4421.128s">in</a>  the years that the Jingle Bell Festival has been in existence and has definitely raised good amounts of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4429.434s">But</a>  I can tell you today that if I were approached today and asked, do I want to open my house to the general public and support the Jingle Bell Festival by opening up my house to everyone, I would have to say, no, I'm too scared to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4449.775s">So</a>  I don't think that those of you who feel that this resolution is something that should be passed in its entirety, the way that it is written, I don't think that you recognize the repercussions because there are not many people who thread that needle about what Zionism is, what Judaism is, who threads that needle. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4476.36s">I</a>  am scared. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4478.641s">And</a>  all politics is local. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4482.044s">Tip</a>  O'Neill. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4485.186s">And</a>  this is what's local to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4488.788s">It</a>  scares me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4492.03s">The</a>  resolution is not going to have an effect on what happens in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4497.773s">In</a>  some sense, I think it's a lot of grandstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4503.845s">And</a>  there have been many of us who have felt, well, you know, people own businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4511.327s">They've</a>  held positions of responsibility in the community, just like 1933 in Germany. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4519.87s">People</a>  own businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4522.19s">They</a>  have thousands of employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4526.512s">but</a>  the Jewish component stirs up anti-Semitism. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4532.977s">I</a>  don't think that you mean to do that, but it happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4538.702s">And</a>  it was, again, I'll reference that bumper sticker, on my way to a picnic with my grandchildren at the Brooks Estates last Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4551.656s">My</a>  grandchildren were upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4554.177s">I</a>  was upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4555.557s">There</a>  was obviously nothing we could do, but it definitely stirred up that pot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4564.28s">I</a>  don't want to continue to be scared. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4568.161s">So</a>  I don't know what your resolution is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4576.183s">But</a>  I am scared, and I think that the proponents of this resolution don't understand the fear that some of us feel.</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4819.861s">Rabbi</a>  Jessica Dallara, One Hammond Place, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4823.924s">I</a>  am also disappointed that I see no effort has been made to amend the problems with Section D that I and many others pointed out last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4831.266s">There's</a>  no criteria for determining it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4833.946s">There's</a>  no list of permissible and impermissible companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4836.607s">There's</a>  no process defined for appeal or review of such designations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4841.028s">No</a>  attempt to allay the concerns that I and my community have brought up about that this will be unevenly applied, primarily or exclusively targeting Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4849.65s">I</a>  didn't want to be this pedantic, but you didn't even fix the typo that it would be determined by international humanities organizations instead of humanitarian. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4857.632s">What</a>  are we going to ask the Modern Language Association, the International Baccalaureate, to decide what we should be investing in? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4863.734s">Last</a>  time I felt obligated to speak on behalf of those members of my Temple Shalom community who were and continue to be alarmed that enshrining even a vague backdoor BDS into the law of our city has the potential to endanger Jewish residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4876.517s">Tonight</a>  I speak on behalf of the moderate middle the majority of my congregants who hold tight, the increasingly counter cultural values of nuance and compassion, the thoughtful liberal to progressive politically active congregants who otherwise cheer on much of the work of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4893.965s">but</a>  who will not be goaded into trying to prove we're one of the good Jews by turning our backs on Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4900.847s">I</a>  personally, as the rabbi of the only synagogue here in Medford, cannot stand silent to allow a bad ordinance to enshrine disguised anti-Israel posturing into the law of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4911.889s">That</a>  obligation as a Jewish leader is independent from my own personal opinions, either about Israel or about the other provisions of this ordinance, many of which I and a majority of my congregants would actually support. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4924.172s">It</a>  is not only possible but common in my Temple Shalom community to hold on to the humanity on both sides of the terrible conflict between Israel and Gaza, to weep not only for the remaining 48 hostages still held captive by Hamas, but for all of the suffering and displacement and loss that has plagued Israel and Gaza and the wider region since October 7, 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4947.563s">Those</a>  wearing keffiyehs with their kippahs have never had a monopoly on the Jewish value of rachamim, compassion, nor on shalom, a desire for morally acceptable peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4958.445s">But</a>  this ordinance seeks to shoehorn me and my congregants into a false binary where we either must prove our progressive bona fides by allowing Israel to be targeted here in all but name, or we are officially putting ourselves outside the boundaries of Medford values. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4975.228s">I</a>  reject that premise fundamentally, I am pushing back against this ordinance because of my Jewish values and because of my civic values as an American and a Medford homeowner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4985.538s">This</a>  ordinance is badly worded liable to endless and expensive legal challenge, ensure to change nothing on the ground overseas, its main impact will be symbolic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=4995.367s">telling</a>  all of us Jews whose opinion of Israel goes anything beyond a reactive and un-nuanced antipathy that we do not belong here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5002.534s">It</a>  erases us from the narrative of our city, just as surely as the name Yisrael has been erased from the text of this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5009.72s">Until</a>  and unless Section D is removed or substantially amended to allay the concerns that I and my congregants have now repeatedly raised, I must continue to oppose this measure, which does not align with my values. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5021.43s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5039.584s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5040.004s">Hi,</a>  my name is David Lichter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5042.246s">I'm</a>  a Somerville resident, 9 Belmont Place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5045.789s">I'm</a>  here, I wasn't planning on speaking, but I just wanted to, so I don't have prepared remarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5051.514s">I</a>  just want to give you a flavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5053.376s">I'd</a>  like to speak in favor of my fellow supporters there in the room who are brave enough to speak out against this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5060.702s">I</a>  want to give you a flavor of what <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5062.884s">The</a>  practicality of doing this has done in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5066.767s">And</a>  I want to relay back earlier comments to Mr. Kesselman about speaking about his his child. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5074.554s">I</a>  have a daughter in the school system, a young nine year old. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5077.496s">And</a>  what we see around Somerville every single day, because we have a BDS measure on our ballot in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5085.463s">is</a>  harassment, intimidation of community members with chants, public slogans, kathiyas everywhere, storming city hall, trying to intimidate our mayor, our city councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5097.926s">And</a>  what this often comes from in a very uncivilized and disrespectful way is anti-Israel rhetoric, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5105.268s">which</a>  is anti-American. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5107.609s">It's</a>  disrespectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5109.389s">It's</a>  discriminatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5111.07s">And</a>  BDS, by that nature, is promoting narratives of terrorist organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5116.672s">It</a>  doesn't belong in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5118.333s">There</a>  are better ways to unite the community than this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5121.754s">I</a>  speak very strongly against this, and I urge the committee to learn from the example going on in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5128.436s">We're</a>  just down the road, and we see this hate every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5131.537s">Thank</a>  you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5132.398s">I</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5145.217s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5146.538s">Gaston</a>  Fiore 61, Stigney Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5148.438s">So</a>  I oppose this so-called values-aligned investment audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5152.079s">I</a>  spoke against it last time, so I'm not going to repeat myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5155.0s">I'm</a>  just going to ask a few questions about what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5158.12s">So</a>  the first one is that <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5161.141s">Paragraph</a>  D was mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5162.802s">I</a>  also mentioned Paragraph C because it says any companies that derive any of its revenue, that's even $1. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5169.046s">Do</a>  we like weather satellites or we don't want any more weather satellites? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5172.428s">Because</a>  we're not going to be able to invest in any companies that, for example, manufacture weather satellites. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5176.651s">And</a>  as some other people have mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5179.092s">even</a>  companies that produce applications or the electronics that we use on a daily basis would fall under this category as well because it's even $1 that they get out of weapons of any kind, including defense contractors, then we can invest. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5193.065s">So</a>  this is against our national security, the US national security. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5201.633s">it's</a>  also against our finances, which after all is taxpayers money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5206.716s">So</a>  I also would like to point out that there have been no change in this audience since last time to this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5213.04s">So</a>  it goes postpone again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5214.621s">So</a>  I'm sure you know, everyone here, we make an effort, we love coming here, we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5219.544s">But</a>  it's also like, you know, it's a little bit taxing, like tomorrow, we have to come again, because we have to discuss zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5224.808s">So</a>  um, you know, I <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5226.949s">I'm</a>  just a little bit frustrated that things get put in the agenda and then they get postponed to September or to some future meeting that we have no idea about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5234.735s">So</a>  I would like that to end. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5237.917s">And</a>  I would also like to mention that, you know, so <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5243.994s">I'm</a>  a little bit, I'm not sure about this resident support of this, as was mentioned earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5251.044s">So</a>  I would like to remind everyone that we live in a democratic system, at least up to now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5255.57s">And</a>  then, you know, so people get elected, and they need to work for all of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5260.116s">not</a>  a special interest group, not a very small proportion, and in the best case scenario for all of us, and in the worst case scenario for the people that have voted for some of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5268.001s">And</a>  I remind that participation in local elections covers around 30%, and then no one gets 100% or 30%, which means that overall, the people that have voted for you, it's like probably around a quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5279.229s">And</a>  I can't imagine that a quarter of those, if all of those people actually support this kind of voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5284.553s">And</a>  so, I just feel that, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5288.196s">we</a>  need to do a little bit of a better job at sort of listening to the whole city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5292.077s">What</a>  has happened to all the comments that were heard last time, my comment included, and everyone else's. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5296.539s">The</a>  comments today, the comments that are going to happen next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5298.84s">Is</a>  the audience still going to look the same, or is it going to change? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5301.161s">Is</a>  someone going to address what we're saying, or nothing is going to change? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5304.262s">Because</a>  otherwise, you should just tell us, like, you know, high-quality participation, and then just pass whatever you want to pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5310.264s">And</a>  then it would have the same effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5311.904s">So</a>  thank you so much for listening.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5487.713s">Good</a>  evening, council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5488.454s">My</a>  name is Judy Beatrice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5490.175s">I'm</a>  chairman of the Commissioners Trust Funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5492.957s">We</a>  manage and I do share responsibility to invest such funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5497.141s">I'm</a>  here to say that this particular document, I have looked hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5502.645s">It</a>  looks to me like it was rewritten from one of the Boston documents on divestment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5506.888s">And</a>  I did notice when I was going through the Boston, I said it does not apply to Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5511.752s">My</a>  mate, there's enough people talking here about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5513.754s">My</a>  concern and from my point of view of manager and we have the fiduciary responsibility for all the trust funds is the fact it says no public funds, no public funds, no public funds and no public funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5525.545s">The</a>  only public funds that I know currently that exist in the city are tax receipts, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5530.555s">If</a>  you've got the Inflation Reduction Act, you have money from me, that's a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5533.636s">Those</a>  are public funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5535.497s">The</a>  funds that we manage or that your pension fund manage, they are not public funds by statute, by Massachusetts statute and by ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5544.242s">So</a>  I think there really needs to be some serious consideration about the verbiage of this particular bill that it really doesn't really match, I think, what you're trying to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5553.206s">It</a>  will cause, well, I can tell you very frankly, the commissioners, we will disagree with the fact that our funds are public, they are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5560.249s">we</a>  operate under fiduciary rules and therefore, and the Prudent Investment Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5563.911s">And</a>  we have managed the fund appropriately to make sure that there are funds available as given by the various trusts that we operate for the benefit of whom they wanted to be beneficiaries of those funds, including and not unlimited to the perpetual care of the cemetery, which goes into your budget to the tune of 200,000 plus every single year by our management. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5583.222s">And</a>  by having taken over that fund years ago and straightening it out, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5587.364s">Formerly,</a>  when I first was on this committee, it was all invested in bonds. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5591.745s">And</a>  in bonds, it was great because if you bought a bond in 1986, they were paying 10, 12, 13%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5596.787s">Well,</a>  guess what happened when they all came through 30 years later? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5601.488s">They</a>  were worth nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5602.768s">And</a>  unfortunately, that fund, which was supposed to take care of perpetual care and your budget, was down to nothing when we took it over because there were no 15, 20% bonds out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5612.931s">So</a>  it was a process of investing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5615.31s">So</a>  I think you really need to have some serious, I'm very happy to be available to you and go through this as to what is needed, but you need to have a serious consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5623.545s">Now</a>  I did recall the other night that somebody mentioned the main divestment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5627.892s">I</a>  went and looked it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5629.642s">The</a>  main divestment ordinance, and I read it very carefully, it doesn't sound like this at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5636.225s">In</a>  fact, it makes a very specific, and they mean it, they're talking specifically in this case about the retirement pension funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5643.048s">And</a>  they make the point very clearly that in the process of doing it, that they measure time, benefit, risk, in terms of the process of how they unwind and what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5654.092s">Now,</a>  you may not realize that most of the time these ESG funds have been invested by private equity, because your average fund can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5661.594s">Private</a>  equity funds are very risky. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5664.055s">They</a>  have what we call a J curve, which means, oh, think of the steward hospitals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5667.696s">That's</a>  another example of a private equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5669.816s">So</a>  when you first invest, they collect money from other people, and they invest it in, hopefully, in things that will return an investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5675.918s">The</a>  J curb goes down which means it's not making any money and you have to wait for the tail to come back up to make it and then they throw all the money out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5683.527s">So</a>  it was really clear from reading the main the main divestment that they were waiting because they had to wait because they did equity investments they were still waiting till 28 to unwind that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5694.579s">We</a>  as commissioners <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5696.487s">And</a>  with our investment managers, we make decisions every single quarter, sometimes more often, particularly in 220 and 221 and 222, because of the needs to adjust what you need for your budget, what our trusts need for their trust, what they're going to distribute money for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5711.423s">We</a>  make those decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5713.004s">We</a>  are not a public fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5715.368s">I</a>  do believe you need to reconsider the verbiage of this and not have any, there is problems with the verbiage in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5720.436s">I</a>  think we need to have a table so we have, and I'm very happy to talk with any of you at any time, as are my members. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5725.423s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5740.525s">I</a>  spoke with Judy today, Judy Johnston, and we're going to set up a meeting with you to talk about something.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5747.031s">Is</a>  there anyone who hasn't had a chance to speak yet who would like to speak in public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5759.083s">going</a>  to go to Zoom and then I'll come back to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5762.688s">You've</a>  raised your hands at the same well, period at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5766.754s">Going</a>  to go to Meryl Pearlson, name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5769.237s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[-nzz6eWSWpU_SPEAKER_67]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5772.738s">Hi,</a>  I'm Morell Carlson I live at 97 be Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5777.443s">I</a>  actually did not prepare to speak on this tonight I too was coming to just hear what was going on with the zoning amendments and, but I feel compelled to speak about the values aligned ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5794.222s">and</a>  which I just hurriedly referenced and read through. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5797.783s">And</a>  let's not kid ourselves about paragraph D. The language in there is clearly intended as dog whistle words copied directly from BDS organizations that have been at least honestly more explicit about their anti-Israel agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5813.428s">Hearing</a>  that there's been no change since the last public discussion on this is disheartening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5819.85s">Mr.</a>  Kesselman expressed that those arguments, those arguing against the ordinance are perpetuating a false equivalency between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5829.292s">But</a>  this equivalency is something that every Jewish person, including myself, lives with every day, regardless of our political stances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5837.734s">It's</a>  been thrust on us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5839.934s">And</a>  please know also that as a parent, I greatly sympathize with your fears, with your concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5844.895s">In</a>  fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5846.436s">When</a>  my son went through Medford public schools with several members on this council, he experienced anti semitism, and I don't want us to kid ourselves that it can't happen here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5859.074s">So</a>  I. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5862.198s">and</a>  I also am aware of many recent incidents in other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5866.681s">Aside</a>  from the disguised agenda, the vagary of the language is clearly problematic as we're hearing from people who have expertise in finance and investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5877.688s">And</a>  mostly I just want to say that I think there's so much great going on in Medford and I think there's also a lot of needs that Medford has to have addressed and this <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5889.294s">just</a>  seems like it is coming from an external agenda that maybe we need to take care of more business at home first. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5898.376s">So</a>  thank you for allowing my impromptu remarks.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5903.737s">Thank</a>  you for your comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5904.697s">I'm</a>  going to go back to the podium for anyone who hasn't had a chance to speak yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5911.779s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5913.099s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

This is a trash ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5941.317s">And</a>  again, you've divided the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5943.73s">This</a>  whole thing should just be tossed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5946.171s">You</a>  have a Councilor here who's in the Navy, and I don't understand why defense contractors that make defensive weapons are bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5956.074s">Is</a>  it because the military who uses them? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5958.795s">Is</a>  it the fact that we don't defend ourselves with bubbles? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5962.676s">I</a>  don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5964.077s">Do</a>  you not invest in DJI, which is a drone company, because those can be used as offensive weapons? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5970.139s">There's</a>  a company called Raytheon that some of you may have heard of. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5973.635s">They</a>  have offshoots in Cambridge, so that's kind of a local company, as well as North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5978.616s">In</a>  fact, they pay for the schools there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5981.217s">Does</a>  everyone who works at Raytheon, are they a baby killer? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5984.858s">Most</a>  of you weren't alive in the 70s when folks like my dad were coming home from Vietnam. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5990.599s">He</a>  didn't want to go to that war, but he was spit on and called a baby killer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5994.74s">He</a>  was a medic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5996.261s">He</a>  saved lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5998.281s">You</a>  don't know the consequences of what you're writing in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6001.583s">And</a>  if your values are so hard up on that and it's because this government for whatever reason does anything offensive and not strictly defensive, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6012.027s">I</a>  mean, put your money where your mouth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6013.627s">Maybe</a>  one of the councilors should resign his commission then if he really feels that strongly about this and that's his values. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6020.649s">This</a>  whole thing is not the values of the city, just a subset, a select few of you that decided to take this up and divide the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6029.672s">Congrats,</a>  it's still working.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6877.132s">William</a>  Ellison, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6880.093s">You</a>  have a great opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6881.774s">Bring</a>  people together, bring people together in small groups, bring people together to talk to each other and talk with each other and understand the history of the Middle East. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6890.418s">Understand</a>  the tensions, understand all the peace treaties that were broken and not gone forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6895.641s">So</a>  we can basically have a really good understanding of how to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6900.383s">A</a>  performative ordinance <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6902.787s">that's</a>  going to get knocked down by legal issues, financial issues, and other things like that, doesn't really bring people together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6910.55s">Try</a>  to find ways so people can sit together and talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6913.471s">I</a>  can tell you that last year or the year before, we had a book club at the temple, and we invited the imam from the cultural center. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6920.974s">Great</a>  discussion, great discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6924.035s">We're</a>  as concerned about Muslims as we are about Jews. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6927.237s">We</a>  understand that any number of people can be discriminated against. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6931.011s">the</a>  way to bring things together, the way to build community, is not to put something out there that fragments, but to put in place processes that enable us to talk with each other, share viewpoints, and come to new understandings that allow us to move forward as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6947.183s">I</a>  appreciate your understanding, and I hope that you'll take that advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6951.066s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Clerkin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6963.219s">Patrick</a>  Clerkin, 50 Princeton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6965.87s">So</a>  I wanted to address two particular sub-issues on this, and the first is related to the wholesale divestment from particularly the fossil fuel industries. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6979.997s">I</a>  think that people don't realize the ripple effects of the fossil fuel divestment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6984.199s">There</a>  are other industries, the chemical industry, the plastics industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6988.361s">I</a>  have critiques of all of these industries, and I think that there's <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6993.343s">substantial</a>  negatives to them, but there's also substantial positives to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6997.405s">A</a>  lot of what we have that we take for granted are clothes, eyeglasses, equipment around us, medical equipment, vehicle equipment that reduce vehicle weight and that reduce vehicle emissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7013.452s">A</a>  lot of good things come from the fossil fuel industry and its byproducts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7019.455s">And</a>  so I'm concerned with the wholesale divestment, first of all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7022.958s">And</a>  the second thing is, I think there are other industries that equally have downsides to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7030.546s">So</a>  looking at defense, we're focusing on how the defense industries have more of an emphasis on <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7037.552s">war</a>  rather than defense and peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7039.633s">I</a>  understand that criticism. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7041.814s">You</a>  could add to the list media, which tends to emphasize getting people profiting off of getting people to hate each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7051.057s">You</a>  could focus on the pharmaceutical industry, which often focuses more on sickness rather than on health. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7059.92s">I</a>  think it's easier to focus on defense industries and fossil fuel industries when they're located geographically in say Texas or the or the south of the United States and not focus on the pharmaceutical industry which is in our own backyard which has <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7075.684s">jobs</a>  and money flowing through the veins of Massachusetts more so than these things that we're trying to divest. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7081.448s">And</a>  I think it's very specific and odd to focus on just several of these things and wholesale divest from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7090.693s">So</a>  I think if you look at the broad systems level perspective, there's tradeoffs everywhere, and I think it should be looked at more piecemeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7098.958s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7100.82s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7102.866s">Is</a>  there anyone in the chamber who would like to speak on public participation who hasn't spoken yet?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8025.604s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears for allowing me the opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8028.747s">I'll</a>  keep this brief because the paper has been tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8031.509s">We</a>  have other items on the agenda still to get to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8033.951s">I</a>  shared a lot three weeks ago about my reasons for supporting this ordinance, and I will not repeat all of that tonight, especially because this will be coming up before the council again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8045.947s">for</a>  both councillors and members of the public to comment on in a future meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8052.752s">I</a>  just wanted to share before I make a motion to revert back to our regular order of business, that as Medford's first and only Jewish city councillor, I hope that our future conversations on this ordinance <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8068.493s">contain</a>  less anti-Semitic language than what I heard tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8071.296s">And</a>  by that, I mean, I will say every time it happens, how offensive I find it as a Jew, when anybody purports to speak for the Jewish community as a monolith. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8084.448s">We</a>  do not all support this ordinance or ordinances like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8088.172s">We</a>  do not all condemn it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8090.074s">We</a>  do not all feel scared by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8092.316s">Some</a>  of us do, apparently. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8094.78s">Not</a>  all Jews feel an inherent link between the nation-state of Israel and the Jewish people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8099.963s">The</a>  Jewish community is an incredibly religiously, culturally, ethnically, ideologically, and politically plural community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8111.369s">To</a>  say that the Jewish community is a monolith, to purport to speak for the entire Jewish community, and I'm speaking to people who do not identify as Jews, as well as people who are, on this ordinance, on anything else, I find is anti-Semitic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8124.431s">And</a>  I sincerely hope that when we continue our productive conversations about this ordinance in future meetings, people can speak for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8131.855s">They</a>  can speak for people that they have personally talked to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8133.916s">They</a>  can speak for groups that they represent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8136.378s">And</a>  I fervently wish that people will not be so offensive to the Jewish community to report that we are a flat monolith with one opinion on any issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8147.604s">It</a>  is extremely offensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8150.346s">Thank</a>  you for the time.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8361.597s">Paper</a>  <a href="../resolutions/25-114.pdf"><font color="green">25-114</font></a> offered by Councilor Callahan and President Bears whereas as part of its 2024 2025 governing agenda and previous resolutions the council has stated its intention to implement the good landlord tax credit in order to help keep rents affordable and support landlords who offer below market rental rates and <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8380.11s">whereas</a>  the state law enabling the good landlord tax credit s 1795 specifically limits the quote qualified residential rental property to any unsubsidized two to four unit residential rental property <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8392.978s">And</a>  whereas the reason the council has not yet adopted this provision of state law is because of an analysis by the assessing department that stated that the tax credit would not be limited to small two to four unit rental properties, and this would provide a significant unintended benefit to corporate owners of large properties and impact the city's property tax levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8410.78s">Now,</a>  therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we request that the city solicitor provide a written legal opinion on whether the local adoption of the Good Landlord Tax Credit could be limited to two to four unit properties and provide both the City Council and the Chief Assessor with said opinion and be it further resolved that we request that the Chief Assessor provide the City Council with the potential impact of a Medford Good Landlord Tax Credit on the city's property tax levy based on the opinion provided by the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8437.868s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8440.923s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8443.303s">I</a>  know that I am in favor of the good landlord tax credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8447.524s">I</a>  know there has been some investigation sort of behind the scenes about asking the assessor about whether it would in fact be limited to two to four unit properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8461.887s">And</a>  I think that it's just, it would be best for us to have this discussion in a committee where we can all hear the assessor's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8470.169s">It</a>  would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8470.91s">We</a>  have a new solicitor or bigger to have the solicitor, you know, provide legal opinion because really it is a legal opinion on what this state law, whether the state law will actually do what it is written that it will do, or if it will not be upheld to that writing that passed in the past session. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8488.947s">And</a>  I really want to get to the bottom of whether we can pass this here in Medford because I would like to, and I just want to understand and have the full council be able to understand if there are reasons why we're not able to get this thing passed.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8504.671s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8505.892s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8507.987s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8508.567s">I</a>  fully agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8510.049s">I</a>  had conversations with the assessor about a year ago about potentially passing the new good landlord tax credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8517.574s">And</a>  he basically said that it was a, well, he hinted that it wouldn't quite have the effect that we wanted because it would apply equally to landlords, like small local landlords who willingly kept their, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8532.926s">kept</a>  their rents low, as well as larger properties that are usually owned by companies who are, in many cases, required to keep affordable housing rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8544.133s">There's</a>  no sort of legal way to distinguish between the two under state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8547.736s">But</a>  I think it would be worthwhile to have those discussions in public and have a bit more of a formal analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8556.201s">So</a>  I'd like to thank my colleagues for bringing this forward.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8846.905s">Good</a>  evening, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8847.846s">Thank</a>  you so much for making the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8849.267s">Happy</a>  to be the caboose on this evening tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8851.749s">We're</a>  here today to seek CPA appropriation for historic preservation of the Medford Armory that's right here in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8860.596s">Unfortunately,</a>  members from the trust could not join me tonight, but I'm happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8865.7s">This</a>  is a quick brief overview. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8867.841s">They</a>  have done their due diligence as stewards of this historic building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8871.464s">This</a>  is a prominent building to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8873.266s">It</a>  is our armory. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8875.367s">Actually,</a>  interestingly, I did a little bit more research into this and it was financed by Samuel Crocker Lawrence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8882.45s">So</a>  our very first mayor had his fingers very much into that building here, but it was used as military facility up until it was sold and I believe in the 70s. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8893.155s">What</a>  they're looking to do right now is they've again done their due diligence conducted conditions assessment of the building once they started noticing some failures of the exterior. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8902.301s">And</a>  have started putting together financial packages for what that looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8906.744s">They're</a>  looking down the barrel of an $800,000 project. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8910.007s">But</a>  what we are here before you tonight is to ask for emergency funding to fix one particular corner of the facade that is experiencing some water inundation that is <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8923.617s">exacerbating</a>  the issues, the known issues with the building exterior. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8928.398s">So</a>  they have come to us asking for a 50% match on that funding, and the Council has, our committee has recommended that funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8939.361s">So</a>  again, happy to answer any questions.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8944.883s">Thank</a>  you, Manager Dupont. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8946.363s">Do</a>  we have any questions from members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8955.218s">Seeing</a>  none, is there a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8957.42s">On</a>  the motion to approve by Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Callahan, I'm going to go to Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8963.464s">Name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8964.365s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8965.946s">I</a>  just have one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8969.228s">I</a>  thought the armory was under private ownership. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8973.391s">Are</a>  we allowed to use our public money on a private building?</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8981.604s">I</a>  can address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8982.325s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8982.865s">It</a>  is privately owned. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8984.306s">However,</a>  this building is on the National Registry of Historic Places. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8987.709s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8988.93s">It's</a>  National Registry of Historic Places, so that is a historical asset. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8993.694s">I</a>  will say that it is very much eligible under Department of Revenue <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8998.297s">we're</a>  looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8999.657s">Guidance.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8999.858s">Um</a>  whether or not it's necessarily a priority of the Community Preservation Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9004.019s">That</a>  is one thing we will be looking at our guidelines for future applications as it pertains to private entities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9011.621s">We</a>  felt the committee felt very strongly that this is an asset for the city of <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9021.084s">So</a>  we felt that this was a good partnership for the immediate move of fixing this emergency funding.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9027.33s">What's</a>  the total cost?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9028.951s">I</a>  believe the total cost for the project is somewhere around $800,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9032.214s">They're</a>  intending to phase that in over the next few years so that it's not a huge financial burden to the organization.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9041.402s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9041.903s">Do</a>  we have any other comment from members of the public on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9045.106s">Seeing</a>  Mr. Fiori, name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9047.147s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9048.564s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President Gaston fear 61 stinger actually Andy basically asked my question so what is exactly what makes this private building, able to receive these funds that is what.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9065.415s">Again,</a>  as it does have special designation as a, yes, it's a protected building under the National Registry of Historic Places. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9072.179s">And</a>  again, the committee doesn't wanna set any sort of precedence for private ownership, but under historic preservation, under the Department of Revenue guidance, if it meets these certain parameters, which it does, we are able to fund private entities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9087.488s">And</a>  again, it's not something we wanna set precedence for, and we will be reevaluating our guidelines going forwards just so that we can <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9095.013s">kind</a>  of head these off.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9097.274s">So</a>  that was my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9098.574s">So</a>  setting precedent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9100.175s">So</a>  how many buildings are under the same condition that then because we funded this particular project could come and say, well, we're in the same condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9109.459s">And</a>  don't get me wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9110.159s">I</a>  mean, if it's an emergency, something needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9113.981s">But</a>  we could be setting precedent here that then some of the buildings are in the same condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9118.242s">I</a>  don't know whether any. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9119.783s">But</a>  I think it's something worthwhile to take a look. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9122.404s">And</a>  again, if there's an emergency, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9124.781s">I</a>  will approve this tonight, but I think it requires further consideration, given that it's taxpayers' money, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9133.37s">So,</a>  and then the second part is that what are we getting in return after this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9137.474s">So,</a>  because it says here, after this gets solved and the emergency gets addressed, which is the priority, I want to re-emphasize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9145.683s">It</a>  says the applicant will work with the Community Preservation Act manager to coordinate one to two public events annually for a 10-year period in which the project building at 92 High School will be open to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9157.236s">So</a>  if it's a private building, what does it mean that the building will be open to the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9165.292s">And</a>  again, I'm not familiar with the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9166.833s">So</a>  I'm just asking questions as someone that as a resident that is concerned about how our taxpayers money is being used, and knows nothing about this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9176.696s">And</a>  obviously, I want to prioritize the emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9178.877s">I'm</a>  going to repeat that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9180.557s">But</a>  I'm worried about present. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9182.818s">And</a>  then I'm also worried about is just giving the money and then that's it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9186.519s">Or</a>  is this a loan at zero interest? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9189.136s">Is</a>  this something else? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9193.561s">So</a>  those are my questions.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9195.262s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9195.483s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9195.903s">I</a>  mean, my understanding is this an appropriation, so the money would go directly to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9200.067s">I</a>  don't know if you want to add some information.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9202.95s">I</a>  just want to clarify the condition of the funding to open up the doors for public events. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9209.017s">They</a>  will be working <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9210.398s">through</a>  me through the mayor's office on organizing, you know, the coffee and cookies visits with veterans office to open up their doors so that that is being posted there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9218.823s">So</a>  effectively, just kind of making the building a little bit, having more of a direct public benefit beyond just having it be an asset of the city.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9231.17s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9233.78s">One</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9235.121s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9235.781s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9236.102s">I</a>  know you do so much work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9237.362s">I</a>  know I brought this up in the past and your comment was that community preservation, the, I won't bring up what that location was, but you said it was part of the community and it was historical. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9250.35s">So,</a>  but again, I think that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9253.112s">Fiora</a>  brings up a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9254.833s">that</a>  as we move forward, I think that, meaning that it's an emergency, and I feel that this is, as a person who supported the Community Preservation Act and understanding that saving these locations are very important, especially in the city of Medford, which is the key, I think that legally <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9276.467s">If</a>  it starts getting into a slippery slope, I think that as we move forward, I just let you know that I'll be reaching out more in depth because I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9287.787s">Mr.</a>  Fiora brings up a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9289.528s">If</a>  today is one thing, it could be another location with another home and a person can buy a historical home and say, well, I can't afford the windows, let me apply to the CPA and just assume you're gonna pay for the windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9304.978s">And</a>  I know that that's not the intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9306.779s">So</a>  again, I think that that's something that you've been working, you have your due diligence and you're doing your due diligence with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9313.183s">And</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9315.834s">share</a>  that with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9316.555s">So</a>  I think the component was the community piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9319.819s">So</a>  yes, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9321.301s">And</a>  thank you for your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9322.262s">Yeah,</a>  but the community is not interested in funding private entities going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9328.068s">This</a>  was just a very unique situation with a unique building for a relatively small ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9333.535s">So</a>  and again, within our <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9336.137s">eligibility</a>  here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9337.097s">We</a>  were very diligent on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9338.318s">We</a>  actually coursed this application over the two meetings just to really discuss it and have some.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9343.84s">So</a>  it's not some thorough. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9345.12s">It</a>  wasn't so the public knows not taken out of thin air. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9347.862s">You</a>  didn't just make something arbitrarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9350.062s">It's</a>  in the bylaws and discussion aligns with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9353.004s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9354.284s">And</a>  I appreciate the commentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9356.485s">Truly.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9359.006s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9359.286s">We</a>  have any other questions for Councilor Tala and for Manager Dupont?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9367.009s">Did</a>  I just get promoted? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9367.81s">Oh,</a>  I'm a councilor.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9369.05s">Well,</a>  I just got you two confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9370.952s">I</a>  don't know how. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9375.255s">On</a>  the motion to approve by Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9382.46s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=9383.401s">Ronnie</a>  Dangerfield.</p>
