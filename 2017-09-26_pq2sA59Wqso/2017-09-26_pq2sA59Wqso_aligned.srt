1
00:01:59,603 --> 00:02:01,025
No, I didn't approve the 15th and they're in there.

Vice President Mox?

13
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:44,294
Present.

14
00:02:45,015 --> 00:02:45,795
Councilor Scarpelli?

15
00:02:45,835 --> 00:02:46,115

President Caviello?

17
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:48,036
Present.

18
00:02:49,137 --> 00:02:50,838
Please rise and salute the flag.

19
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:53,539
I pledge allegiance

20
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:11,287
All right.

21
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,811
Mr. President, motion to suspend the rules to take some items from last week's meeting off the table.

22
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:20,934
Motion by Councilor Knight to suspend the rules to take a paper that was tabled last week off the table.

23
00:03:21,014 --> 00:03:21,715
Seconded by?

24
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:22,755
Councilor DelaRosa.

25
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:23,576
Councilor DelaRosa.

26
00:03:23,596 --> 00:03:24,257
All those in favor?

27
00:03:24,717 --> 00:03:24,837
Aye.

28
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:25,978
Motion passes.

29
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,860
What are we taking off the table?

30
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,081
Mr. President, the paper that I refer to would be 176454647.

31
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:31,181
And 44? 44454647?

32
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,943
Okay, you have the minutes Mr. Clark, from last week?

33
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:48,944
So I can read it?

34
00:03:48,964 --> 00:03:50,425
Mr. President, if I may present these to you.

35
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,866
I would appreciate it, Councilor Tarullo, sir.

36
00:04:17,626 --> 00:04:18,027
Thank you.

37
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:20,676
Okay, 17-644 offered by Council Member Kern.

38
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:34,117
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council be appraised of the past, present, and future planning that has been and will be taking place to evaluate the increase in residential units and the impact it is having on our public safety personnel.

39
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:46,964
Be it further resolved that if there is a plan to increase our public safety personnel numbers and locations to accommodate the increase in population, it be provided to the City of Memphis City Council

40
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,153
If there is no plan, be it resolved that one be put in place.

41
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:53,174
Councilor Lungo-Kern.

42
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:55,236
Thank you, President Carviello.

43
00:04:55,276 --> 00:05:05,364
This is one of the three or four that I put on last week, and I think I have two additional resolutions this week that relate to the development in Medford.

44
00:05:05,384 --> 00:05:15,332
I just wanted to get some answers and see if the discussion has been started, and if not, get the discussion started, get the

45
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:24,044
conversations started with regards to anything and everything that development in the community could be impacted by.

46
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:27,966
And one of those areas is our public safety.

47
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:32,448
We all know that our numbers are stable but low.

48
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:36,249
We're able to provide services as best we can.

49
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,891
We see the police and fire and DPW do and all that they can.

50
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,612
But when you talk to

51
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:49,848
a firefighter or a police officer, they do have questions with regards to when are levels gonna be increased.

52
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:58,716
We seem to always be hiring additional personnel, but it almost seems like we're just filling retirement positions.

53
00:05:59,757 --> 00:06:08,885
And it seems like with the development that potentially has been approved or development that is potentially going to be approved

54
00:06:10,147 --> 00:06:30,523
certain areas within our city that are gonna be developed, I think we need to get a roundtable discussion, if it hasn't happened already, with the chief of police, the chief of fire, DPW commissioner, personnel in the mayor's department, the city council, and the community, and figure out what may be needed.

55
00:06:30,543 --> 00:06:35,987
I mean, I've heard that there's a ladder truck out of service as of this week.

56
00:06:37,258 --> 00:06:43,961
definitely heard rumblings that certain stations are not active with regards to the fire department.

57
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:49,483
You always hear that public safety and the police department is understaffed and that we need more personnel.

58
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:59,786
So what are we gonna do if we're gonna have 500 units plus at potentially multiple areas in this city?

59
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:04,088
Are we going to expand and open more stations?

60
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:06,249
Are we gonna try to increase our numbers

61
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:10,071
police and fire and DPW so we can handle the load.

62
00:07:10,091 --> 00:07:14,574
And this is just one area that needs to just be discussed.

63
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:22,139
I think that it's come to light other areas and people are starting the conversation, but I feel like we all need to be on board.

64
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:33,807
We need to be privy to how we're going to handle it and make sure it's handled accordingly so that we can keep our residents current and future residents safe within our community.

65
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:37,722
Thank you Mr. President.

66
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:42,807
Thank you Councilor Lungo-Kurt for this wonderful resolution.

67
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:48,133
I'd be particularly curious to see where our population is.

68
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:49,314
Is it actually growing?

69
00:07:50,095 --> 00:08:02,604
or is the development just reflecting a spread in population and a diminishment in people per domicile?

70
00:08:03,064 --> 00:08:16,393
I'd also like to see how our present current public safety numbers and our other city service numbers as far as employees delivering services to the city, police, fire, DPW,

71
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:34,264
reflects what we are now as a community of 56,000 as a comparison to when we were a community, I think, at our height in the 60s, 70s was 65, 68,000, I believe.

72
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:40,587
So that would be a worthwhile consideration when we have this conversation, Mr. President.

73
00:08:41,007 --> 00:08:41,308
Thank you.

74
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:50,009
On motion by Councilor Lococo to send this to the Mayor for her action.

75
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:51,389
Seconded by?

76
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:52,250
Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

77
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,670
Councilor Dela Ruzzo, all in favor?

78
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,491
Aye.

79
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:57,792
Motion passes.

80
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:09,118
17-645 offered by Councilor Lococo to be resolved that the City Council be provided a copy of the report on enrollment and class size that was given to the school committee at the September 11, 2017 meeting.

81
00:09:09,598 --> 00:09:10,238
Councilor Lococo.

82
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:15,270
Thank you, President Carviello.

83
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:28,054
I believe since that resolution was put on two Fridays ago, last Tuesday we did receive a report from the superintendent with regards to enrollment and class size.

84
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:31,616
That report, I believe, was from September 7th.

85
00:09:32,436 --> 00:09:37,958
I believe the numbers have increased some, but this too is along the lines of just making

86
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:41,286
I don't have the resolution in front of me.

87
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:43,207
I think I had two very similar.

88
00:09:44,788 --> 00:09:59,496
Yes, I was reading the committee minutes, or the, actually, I think it was the agenda, and I saw that this was on the agenda, so it's something that I always like to see in the fall, as well as when we have budget discussions in June.

89
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:01,738
So we were provided this, so just move approval.

90
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:08,582
Anybody that wants to comment can comment on it, but it seems like all the numbers are,

91
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:12,079
close to if not what they were in June.

92
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:22,929
The one issue that I did speak up about was resolved and I'm glad to see that we're able to keep our class sizes low and I hope we can continue that.

93
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:24,911
Mr. President?

94
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:33,118
On this and related issues, I'd be eager to hear from the superintendent of schools and what he has to portend.

95
00:10:33,318 --> 00:10:33,578
Thank you.

96
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,200
Name and address of the record, please.

97
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,043
So I just want to comment a little bit that I think that the enrollment is good.

98
00:10:46,784 --> 00:10:51,368
And I think that between you and the school committee, it supported the schools very well.

99
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:54,711
And I think we were able to maintain good class size.

100
00:10:56,526 --> 00:11:07,849
I gave you an updated report tonight, which reflected another week into the school year, which is usually the first time there's a bump from the previous numbers that I was able to give you.

101
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:19,652
In that period of time, there were 94 more new students that came into the public schools, 56 in the elementary, 27 in the middle, and 11 at the high school, Volkin and Curtis, a total of 94 students.

102
00:11:20,572 --> 00:11:22,412
There's no significant change in class size.

103
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,453
There's no significant change in space availability and the like.

104
00:11:26,474 --> 00:11:37,122
The distribution of the new numbers, the Brooks had 21, the Columbus had 13, the McGuinn had 10, and the Roberts had three in regular classes.

105
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:45,388
Overall, the Brooks had 26, the Columbus had 13, the McGuinn Elementary had 10, and the Roberts had seven.

106
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,333
Now, overall, I think we're in good shape.

107
00:11:50,453 --> 00:12:04,636
Obviously, I continuously watch things, pay attention, but it doesn't appear that the development that you're bringing into the city is actually having an impact on enrollment because of the nature of the units and because of the cost factors and other things involved.

108
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:09,758
We'll continue to track it and pay attention to it, but it doesn't look like it's doing that.

109
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:16,405
The bigger issues for us are obviously the intensity of services that are maybe required.

110
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:24,835
Sometimes people come into the community with a tremendous need and sometimes that's caused by the fact that the city provides really good services.

111
00:12:25,897 --> 00:12:28,781
And I think that's something that, you know, it's a double-edged sword.

112
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:29,461
It's sort of like a

113
00:12:30,327 --> 00:12:45,447
you know, conundrum in the sense you want to provide the best services possible, you want to provide good special needs services, good ELL services, but the better you do, the more likely you are to attract people who are looking for good services and they may not get them in some other communities.

114
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:56,214
Another factor that we've got to pay attention to a little bit is obviously transportation, because as we move people around, Medford provides 18 buses at free transportation.

115
00:12:56,254 --> 00:13:00,177
We also provide a lot of small vehicles to bring people around to different schools.

116
00:13:00,717 --> 00:13:09,203
And when we move the young people from the Roberts this year in EL classes to the Brooks, we created a little extra transportation cost.

117
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:11,945
So those are things we have to pay attention, take a look to.

118
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:18,572
We also want to see if we can't redirect some students over to the Columbus because that's the lowest enrollment right now.

119
00:13:19,313 --> 00:13:24,898
But overall, we're in very good shape and we should continue to be in good shape and we'll continue to keep you updated.

120
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,980
I think that's, you know, it's important that you know.

121
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:44,116
It's also important that the public understands that development's going to be very important to the community because finances, whether you're talking about the federal government or the cutbacks coming through Washington, you're talking about the state government where there's continued a search for revenue, although September numbers look really good.

122
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:45,798
But I don't know if it's sustainable.

123
00:13:46,598 --> 00:14:00,475
If we don't have development, we're not going to be able to sustain the level of services we want to provide to our young people, public safety, or any other activity that you want to do because it appears to be that there's not a real appetite for other kinds of revenue.

124
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,556
around the state or in Washington.

125
00:14:03,616 --> 00:14:11,957
So those are the big concerns, and I think the development can go hand in hand without impacting the schools, but naturally we always pay attention.

126
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:13,497
So I appreciate you listening.

127
00:14:13,537 --> 00:14:14,618
I'm happy to take any questions.

128
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:15,358
Mr. President?

129
00:14:16,598 --> 00:14:21,439
If I could say, the biggest class we have in the city is 23 at the fifth grade in the Glen?

130
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:24,599
I don't think it's 23 there, but I'll take a look.

131
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,480
I don't think any class is that high.

132
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:37,445
21.5, but the biggest class in the city is 23 at the McGlynn in the fifth grade.

133
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:39,066
I don't see that.

134
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:54,052
If I look at the latest numbers, if you're looking at the actual number or you're looking at the numbers, that's by choice of the, of the principle principle might from time to time decide that certain classes should be a little larger because the youngsters in it are doing well.

135
00:14:54,132 --> 00:14:58,654
And there may be another class that wants to cut it down a little bit because there's a youngster or two that may be more of a challenge.

136
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:00,855
I had an opportunity to, um,

137
00:15:01,854 --> 00:15:06,496
than the opening of the Modera today, which is 50% full right now.

138
00:15:07,377 --> 00:15:12,760
And it's the other 20%, 25% is already under agreement once it opens.

139
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:20,944
And I asked them about children there, and two of the rental people didn't think there were any children at all in that building at the moment.

140
00:15:21,824 --> 00:15:24,946
I just think it's not the kind of developments that are going to-

141
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:28,168
As I said, they couldn't recall of anybody being there.

142
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:34,231
It's not the kind of developments that seem to be attracting young families that one can afford it, and two that might have sufficient space.

143
00:15:34,271 --> 00:15:35,831
It seems to be they're looking for other things.

144
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:39,673
So that's a factor that we need to keep in mind.

145
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:41,312
Mr. President.

146
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:42,753
Councilor Falco.

147
00:15:42,793 --> 00:15:43,514
Thank you, Mr. President.

148
00:15:44,495 --> 00:15:45,495
Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

149
00:15:45,715 --> 00:16:02,347
I just wanted to say as a former member of the school committee, I know that, you know, class size has always been a huge focus with regard to just keeping it low, especially in the younger grades where you really, you know, creating a sound foundation for education.

150
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:06,009
And when I look at these numbers, this is really remarkable.

151
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:14,232
To see this many classes that are in the high teens, 18, 19, 17, this is really remarkable.

152
00:16:14,312 --> 00:16:15,933
And it's across the district.

153
00:16:16,514 --> 00:16:26,658
I know when I was on the school committee, I'd go to the Massachusetts Association of School Committees forum, where they had the organizational meeting every year.

154
00:16:26,678 --> 00:16:29,740
And you talk to people from other school districts, and this is unheard of.

155
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,721
I mean, to have class size this low,

156
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:52,811
absolutely unheard of so I mean congratulations to you and to the school committee for their fine work if you're staying on top of this because this is really remarkable to see class numbers this I know in my years of the school committee when we first came on I know that you know there were some classes you saw are up around 25 26 27 and to see class size down at like 18 19 17

157
00:16:59,094 --> 00:17:00,955
And I think in some instances maybe even smaller.

158
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:01,576
There's one here at 15.

159
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:03,858
I mean, that's remarkable.

160
00:17:04,178 --> 00:17:10,923
And it's great to see that there's a huge focus on class size and keeping it low.

161
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:15,466
And I just think this is remarkable.

162
00:17:15,506 --> 00:17:19,669
And I just want to say great work to you and the school committee for making this a major priority.

163
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:20,170
Thank you.

164
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:21,951
Vice President Mox.

165
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:23,532
Go ahead.

166
00:17:23,652 --> 00:17:24,513
Thank you, Mr. President.

167
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:31,586
Mr. Superintendent, at what point is it a requirement that a teacher aid be put into a classroom?

168
00:17:32,347 --> 00:17:40,633
There's no requirement for regular ed, except if you get into the elementary school, up in the kindergarten, you'd have to be like 28, 29.

169
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:43,054
Is that a contractual requirement?

170
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:44,075
That's a contractual requirement.

171
00:17:44,415 --> 00:17:49,859
Actual class size typically is around, in the contract, 25 and up, in the contract.

172
00:17:52,402 --> 00:17:56,886
So there's no requirement for an aide until you get to like 29 in the elementary school system.

173
00:17:57,486 --> 00:18:00,909
So how many teacher aides currently do we have in the school system?

174
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,731
Well, if you count special ed, we're pushing over 90.

175
00:18:05,532 --> 00:18:13,578
If you're talking about kindergarten, there's 16 kindergartens and there's 16 aides now.

176
00:18:14,318 --> 00:18:20,283
I believe, I'm gonna count them up, probably about 10 of them are full-time and the rest of them are not.

177
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:27,533
And out of the teachers that are listed on the sheet that we were given tonight, how many are paraprofessionals?

178
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,194
They're all teachers.

179
00:18:29,214 --> 00:18:31,656
They're all teachers, so there's no paraprofessionals?

180
00:18:31,676 --> 00:18:33,197
No paraprofessionals covering any classes.

181
00:18:33,418 --> 00:18:35,679
And how many paraprofessionals do we have throughout the system?

182
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:42,065
As I indicated, most of them come from special ed, but I would say there's over 100 because ELL has some and some other areas have some.

183
00:18:42,363 --> 00:18:45,224
So, are you saying a teacher aid and a paraprofessional are one and the same?

184
00:18:45,764 --> 00:18:46,284
Pretty much, yeah.

185
00:18:46,745 --> 00:18:47,705
It just depends what they do.

186
00:18:47,805 --> 00:19:00,349
So, for example, you could have a person who's a tutor, you could have a person who's there assisting in a kindergarten classroom, you could have a person who's helping out in a special needs classroom on a one-to-one aid for a youngster who's physically disabled or has some other impairment.

187
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:01,269
Right.

188
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,031
And how many paraprofessionals are allowed under the contract?

189
00:19:05,471 --> 00:19:06,011
Do you know offhand?

190
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,832
There's no limit to what it's allowed.

191
00:19:07,852 --> 00:19:10,093
It's really a need and budget-related thing.

192
00:19:10,113 --> 00:19:10,893
You know, it really depends.

193
00:19:11,553 --> 00:19:17,176
For example, today, we talked about a particular student who has real needs, and we added one.

194
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:22,199
I mean, just it's a matter of trying to determine what the need is and dealing with it.

195
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:28,462
And from time to time, I suggest to special ed and some of the others, is it necessary to keep an aide where they already are?

196
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:29,563
Can we move somebody over?

197
00:19:30,143 --> 00:19:34,665
It's always a juggle, because obviously, everyone, once they get an aide, they want to keep it.

198
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:39,257
Mr. President, I want to thank the superintendent.

199
00:19:39,297 --> 00:19:43,099
I want to thank Councilor Longo-Kern for bringing this important issue up.

200
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:56,226
You know, I think it's a sad commentary when, you know, you do hear that many of these developments that are coming into the community are not what I consider family friendly.

201
00:19:57,066 --> 00:20:02,069
And you're right, there are very few families that are moving into these developments in the community.

202
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:05,351
And because affordability, number one,

203
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:10,173
And secondly, that the target market is not families.

204
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:21,379
And, you know, I as one member of the council think as a community we have to do a better job in promoting this community as a family-friendly community.

205
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:37,897
And I'd hate to see the very fabric of a community that I love and grew up in that had many families throughout the neighborhoods and around the community change to one that families are not welcome anymore because they can't afford to live in this community, Mr. President.

206
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:41,481
So, you know, when it comes time when the city council looks at

207
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:43,142
zoning and other issues.

208
00:20:43,582 --> 00:20:52,425
I think that has to be a top priority that we remember that, uh, we want to invite everyone into the community, uh, according those that may be on the low income bracket.

209
00:20:52,805 --> 00:21:03,269
And according to those that may have families that can't afford, uh, to be into these high price developments, uh, Mr. President, that are pricing, uh, families out of our community.

210
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:05,790
So I just want to put that out there, Mr. President.

211
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,251
And I thank the superintendent for, uh, his information tonight.

212
00:21:10,232 --> 00:21:10,832
Councilor Lococo.

213
00:21:11,274 --> 00:21:12,654
And thank you, President Carviello.

214
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:16,255
I also want to thank the superintendent for the documents that he provided to us.

215
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:18,115
I'm glad I got a week to review them.

216
00:21:19,076 --> 00:21:20,116
Just a couple questions.

217
00:21:21,336 --> 00:21:26,597
With regards to the jump, I think it was eight days and we had an additional 94 students.

218
00:21:27,437 --> 00:21:32,698
On any given year, how many do we see fluctuate during the month of September?

219
00:21:32,998 --> 00:21:35,579
You might see another 50 students in the schools across the board.

220
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:39,093
At least the way it's normally the pattern is.

221
00:21:40,694 --> 00:21:46,857
We started before September, pre-labor day, and that has an impact on some families.

222
00:21:46,877 --> 00:21:48,518
Some families just want to take the extra days.

223
00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:52,960
And some people don't get wound until they actually hit September.

224
00:21:53,461 --> 00:21:56,162
So that first week is sort of that thing.

225
00:21:56,182 --> 00:22:04,226
But the next week, according to the Parent Information Center, the movement into the schools this past week is not as heavy as it was the week before.

226
00:22:04,246 --> 00:22:05,207
It's much lighter.

227
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:07,622
And then when will it stabilize?

228
00:22:07,662 --> 00:22:09,623
I mean, is there a normal?

229
00:22:09,783 --> 00:22:12,924
The first big cut, a look at this thing is around October 1st.

230
00:22:13,524 --> 00:22:14,665
We take a look on October 1st.

231
00:22:14,685 --> 00:22:20,087
That's when we begin to file numbers with the state as to what our enrollment is.

232
00:22:20,647 --> 00:22:23,748
And that drives Chapter 70 funding and other things of that type.

233
00:22:23,768 --> 00:22:33,432
So we'd like to get a really good handle by October 1st because that tells us what funding we might be eligible for going forward.

234
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:34,433
If I could just request

235
00:22:34,998 --> 00:22:47,619
based on either the parent information center or the school brains database, if we could just get an update, as well as the school committee, mid-October, just when things finally do stabilize so we can just get a more accurate.

236
00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:51,924
accounting of the actual school year and how many children we will have in the city.

237
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:54,325
I don't think it's going to change the numbers of class size.

238
00:22:54,685 --> 00:22:59,289
I'm not worried about it, I just want to have a baseline of where are we going.

239
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:11,337
I also think the information you provided to us, Council Mox is right, I think you did a little research on the developments and it looked like out of a few developments there was only about 105 students.

240
00:23:13,238 --> 00:23:20,442
That on the other end is whether there's too many children and we have this overcrowding issue or there's not enough.

241
00:23:20,843 --> 00:23:25,125
This is going to show that the developments that are coming out, they're so, so expensive.

242
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:27,366
I mean, families cannot afford to live in them.

243
00:23:28,747 --> 00:23:32,810
My concern, there has been a number of units that have come on.

244
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,232
We also have Medford Square that we need to make a decision.

245
00:23:36,272 --> 00:23:37,852
Do we want to rezone Medford Square?

246
00:23:39,643 --> 00:23:50,812
you know, what is gonna happen with Mystic Ave, you have the Locust Street, you have a number of additional units that are coming on, and I just think these are questions that need to be discussed, we need to have a handle on them.

247
00:23:51,412 --> 00:24:06,244
We don't have, a couple schools have more space, but I know there are two schools that have somewhat of a space issue, and it's just something that I believe we have the right to ask questions about, and I'm very happy we have the answers to, and it's something

248
00:24:06,731 --> 00:24:07,731
we need to stay on top of.

249
00:24:07,771 --> 00:24:16,655
We're the ones that are gonna decide the budget in June, and whether it's us or other councilors down the line, what is gonna happen in two years, three years, four years?

250
00:24:17,015 --> 00:24:19,756
So to have some of these answers, I think, is beneficial.

251
00:24:20,656 --> 00:24:28,699
I don't know who discussed some of the answers, if it was just the superintendent or if the school committee actually did discuss it.

252
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,521
If necessary, they'll consider redistricting to shift enrollment to the Columbus.

253
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:37,420
the start of the conversation.

254
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,466
If in five years we have an extra 500 students than we do now, or even 300, where are we gonna go?

255
00:24:43,486 --> 00:24:44,207
What are we gonna do?

256
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:45,408
How are we gonna space it out?

257
00:24:45,428 --> 00:24:48,191
How are we gonna make sure class size stays low?

258
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:50,734
And I think with the group effort, we can do that.

259
00:24:50,794 --> 00:24:54,177
And I just wanna make sure we are on top of it and planning accordingly.

260
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:55,979
Thank you.

261
00:24:57,733 --> 00:25:05,215
On the motion by Council on the current, the report back in and sometime in October motion to take this paper, receive it and place on file.

262
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:06,095
Thank you.

263
00:25:06,135 --> 00:25:07,196
Second, second.

264
00:25:07,436 --> 00:25:09,376
Prove the motion to get an update in October.

265
00:25:09,436 --> 00:25:09,656
Yes.

266
00:25:10,457 --> 00:25:11,257
Motion for approval.

267
00:25:11,317 --> 00:25:12,097
Motion for approval.

268
00:25:14,478 --> 00:25:15,898
Motion approval on the on the amendment.

269
00:25:16,218 --> 00:25:16,799
All right.

270
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:19,739
By Council seconded by Councilor Falco in favor.

271
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:20,780
All right.

272
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,621
And motion to receive the other paper in place on file.

273
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:25,161
Second.

274
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:27,748
Offered by Councilor Lennon, seconded by Councilor Layton.

275
00:25:27,788 --> 00:25:28,408
All those in favor?

276
00:25:29,168 --> 00:25:34,010
Motion passes.

277
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,570
17-647.

278
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,731
Offered by Councilor Longo Kern.

279
00:25:36,751 --> 00:25:49,335
Be it resolved that the school department provide the administration and the city council with numbers as it relates to how many children in rental units within the city attend the Medford Public Schools.

280
00:25:49,455 --> 00:25:50,295
Councilor Longo Kern.

281
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:52,461
I think that also was discussed.

282
00:25:53,362 --> 00:26:01,031
We were given numbers of 105 from five or six different developments that are already station landing, Mystic Valley Parkway.

283
00:26:01,515 --> 00:26:04,016
It looks like Mystic Valley Parkway has the most children.

284
00:26:05,056 --> 00:26:08,997
River's Edge has less than I expected, but we did get the numbers.

285
00:26:09,037 --> 00:26:23,022
I really appreciate that, and I hope that once we have newer developments on the books, that we get an update, whether that be in the spring or even next fall, that we just keep track of it and know where we're going and where we're at.

286
00:26:23,621 --> 00:26:26,662
I'm sure the superintendent will keep us apprised of that.

287
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:27,463
Mr. President.

288
00:26:28,323 --> 00:26:28,823
Councilor Knight.

289
00:26:29,403 --> 00:26:34,586
If I may, the issue of affordable housing in our community is one that's of paramount importance at this point in time.

290
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:38,727
I think Councilor Marks hit the nail on the head when he said that families are being priced out.

291
00:26:38,788 --> 00:26:44,570
Families that have lived in this community for a long time that have helped make Medford the great place that it is to live now are being forced out.

292
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,592
They're being faced with an option as to, you can't afford this, so what are you gonna do?

293
00:26:49,032 --> 00:26:49,532
And you're gonna move.

294
00:26:49,952 --> 00:26:50,893
And we're seeing that a lot.

295
00:26:52,598 --> 00:27:00,685
I'd like to amend the paper, Mr. President, and ask that our Office of Community Development and the Medford Housing Authority do an analysis in regards to Chapter 40R of the General Laws.

296
00:27:01,265 --> 00:27:10,912
And Chapter 40R of the General Laws, Mr. President, relates to affordable housing, but it also provides a two-thirds reimbursement on the per-pupil cost of students that live in those type of developments.

297
00:27:11,092 --> 00:27:20,940
So if we're really serious about making a commitment to increasing the stock of affordable housing in our community, and we have an opportunity to get a two-thirds reimbursement on our per-pupil cost to educate these students,

298
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,801
It would only make sense that we examine that as we move forward.

299
00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:45,649
So I'd like to amend the paper and request that our Office of Community Development and the Medford Housing Authority analyze the possibilities and potential of creating a Chapter 40-odd district to increase the stock of affordable housing in our community, to make it family-friendly, and then to allow us an opportunity to capture some of the revenues from the state that will allow us to offset the cost of the per-pupil expense to educate a child by two-thirds, Mr. President.

300
00:27:46,575 --> 00:27:46,895
Thank you.

301
00:27:47,496 --> 00:27:52,298
On the motion by Councilor Lockern, as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by.

302
00:27:52,498 --> 00:27:53,459
Councilor DelaRusso.

303
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,960
Councilor DelaRusso, all those in favor.

304
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:55,540
Aye.

305
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,781
Motion passes.

306
00:27:58,602 --> 00:28:01,563
Is there more in the suspension, Mr. Pruitt?

307
00:28:01,603 --> 00:28:04,685
We have one more, Councilor Knight.

308
00:28:05,326 --> 00:28:06,186
Now we get this, all right.

309
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:08,788
Very good.

310
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:09,188
I need 575.

311
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:21,251
The past, present and future planning that has been and will be taking place

312
00:28:39,655 --> 00:28:45,420
to evaluate the increase in our student population as it's related to the space and needs within our schools.

313
00:28:45,921 --> 00:28:57,871
We have further resolved that if there has been no planning, the city creates a plan to make sure our schools are not overburdened within the next five, next year, five years and 10 years.

314
00:28:57,911 --> 00:28:58,672
Councilman Locario.

315
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:08,739
I think that also, thank you President Carvello, I think that also was discussed and there's a few lines that the superintendent gave us with regards to shifting and redistricting.

316
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,841
So I appreciate that.

317
00:29:11,442 --> 00:29:19,830
In the future I hope that the school committee can really be involved and round table this and we can be involved as well with regards to planning down the line.

318
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:21,332
So I move approval.

319
00:29:22,318 --> 00:29:24,939
On the motion by council, I'll go occur and seconded by.

320
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:27,719
I thought the dollar was all those in favor.

321
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,300
I motion passes.

322
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:39,402
Seventeen five, seven, five, seven, five.

323
00:29:39,702 --> 00:29:44,123
Petition by Robert M. Penta, zero summit road, never mass to address the council.

324
00:29:46,135 --> 00:30:04,250
to discuss a review of the Home Rule petition to amend Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 44, Sections 16A and B, inclusive with a local legislative and legislative option provision as it relates to the Community Preservation Act and the Community Preservation Act Trust Funds.

325
00:30:05,642 --> 00:30:06,762
Name and address of the record, please.

326
00:30:06,782 --> 00:30:11,383
Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of the Saugus Party.

327
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:30,167
I present this to you, and I believe all of you got a copy of, that's a three-page document that was mailed out early this summer, pursuant to the request of Councilwoman McCurran to explain the rationale behind having a local option filing piece of legislation regarding

328
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:33,064
Community Preservation Act.

329
00:30:33,785 --> 00:30:42,567
When this Community Preservation Act was being sold to the folks here in the city of Medford, they were passing out pieces of literature such as this, talked about the Community Preservation Act.

330
00:30:43,187 --> 00:30:52,330
And on the back it says, communities submit annual reports to the state before receiving matching funds to ensure funds are properly spent.

331
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,731
Matching funds.

332
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:57,872
In 2002, which was the first year of the Community Preservation Act,

333
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:02,289
For the first six years, cities and towns got 100% of their monies.

334
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,992
And at that point in time, there was 113 communities.

335
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:16,242
Now, in 2015, when the city of Medford voted for it, there's 156 communities, and all we're getting back this year is approximately 14.5%.

336
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:17,202
And it's up to 178 communities.

337
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:37,975
The problem that's existing, speaking to these communities, and a lot of the folks, these legislators in these communities, are beginning to realize now that the tax, the CPA tax, the community preservation tax that people are paying for is not being matched by the Commonwealth of Mass.

338
00:31:38,846 --> 00:31:41,008
We voted for this in 2015.

339
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:46,474
Its first year of payment is now coming to us in 2017, this November.

340
00:31:46,954 --> 00:31:55,402
That's approximately $180,000, and we, the committee, collected $1.2 million, $500,000 of taxpayers' money.

341
00:31:56,283 --> 00:32:03,010
The legislation that I'm proposing is not to abolish the CPA, but rather to make it fair and equitable

342
00:32:03,545 --> 00:32:12,587
for the folks who voted for it, and especially for the people of Medford who believed, when they voted for this, that the Commonwealth was going to match dollar for dollar through the trust fund.

343
00:32:13,347 --> 00:32:21,189
And how it's being proposed right now is when you go to the Registry of Deeds, and whether it's a municipal lien or a tax on your real estate deeds, it's $10 or $20.

344
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:29,231
What they're thinking right now is doubling it, and that would constitute another tax on people who buy and sell property.

345
00:32:30,151 --> 00:32:32,072
But putting that aside, until that happens,

346
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:48,317
It was 2013 when it was then Governor DeVal Patrick who took $20 million, I believe, $25 million from the surplus money of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts just to meet the bare bones minimum of monies to go back to cities and towns in 2013.

347
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,062
it was approximately 52% of the monies went back to the cities and towns.

348
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:55,642
We're down now to 14%.

349
00:32:56,643 --> 00:33:07,187
And the law says the state cannot go any lower than 5%, which is sort of like outrageous because you're gonna keep taxing taxpayers in this community for something that's not being met.

350
00:33:07,948 --> 00:33:17,232
People believed when they voted for the Community Preservation Act that the Commonwealth of Mass would match that dollar for dollar, it was advertised as such, and it was stated as such.

351
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:27,909
The two exceptions that I'm asking you folks to consider, and if you don't wanna vote on it tonight, that's all right, but I would appreciate it at least going to the city solicitor for the purposes of the following.

352
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:37,696
I'm asking that there be a hold on the city going further on collecting any monies from taxpayers under the CPA Community Preservation Act.

353
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,137
Because right now, it's not fair.

354
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:46,082
You're telling the taxpayer that they have being taxed at 1.5% of their real estate value minus the first $100,000.

355
00:33:48,322 --> 00:33:52,344
but at the same time they're not going to be getting that dollar amount from the trust fund, from the Commonwealth of Mass Bath.

356
00:33:53,004 --> 00:33:53,705
That's number one.

357
00:33:54,405 --> 00:34:06,251
Number two, the second part of the resolve is that this is a five-year commitment as you know, and it automatically renews itself after five years, unless there's a legislative question on the ballot not to renew it.

358
00:34:07,363 --> 00:34:12,587
This second option is to have it go on the ballot automatically to renew it.

359
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:14,588
So it dies, it's like sunset legislation.

360
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,830
It just dies at the end of five years.

361
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:23,395
And if the community still wants to have it and they wanna go forward with it, they put it back on the ballot once again and the people can vote for it.

362
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:34,362
I don't think it's anything that's detrimental to this community other than the fact you're gonna keep taxing rate payers in this community for something they're not getting their money's worth for and they're not getting the match for.

363
00:34:34,843 --> 00:34:36,384
And this greatly will impede

364
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:46,132
This will greatly impede the concerns and the issues, whether it be for parks, historical pieces of property, low income housing, whatever the decision might be.

365
00:34:46,672 --> 00:34:48,774
Plus the fact, I believe, that they're paying somebody approximately $65,000.

366
00:34:48,814 --> 00:34:50,096
Mr. Pender, can I see that card?

367
00:34:50,136 --> 00:34:50,616
Thank you.

368
00:34:58,801 --> 00:35:06,906
I believe approximately right now somebody's getting paid, I believe if I understood when this came out a couple of months ago, somebody's gonna be paid approximately $65,000, $62,000, $149,000, okay?

369
00:35:06,926 --> 00:35:07,547
So we've collected $1,242,974.

370
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:16,634
from the Medford taxpayers in this community.

371
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:19,458
But all you're getting back from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is approximately $180,000.

372
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:22,081
That's not fair.

373
00:35:22,462 --> 00:35:24,044
That's not the way this was supposed to be going.

374
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:31,455
And now with more people coming on board, there's now 176 people applying for these monies from the Commonwealth.

375
00:35:33,054 --> 00:35:44,163
and having to go to the Registry of Deeds to double increase the taxes for municipal liens and for deed stamps that goes on our recordings, that's not fair.

376
00:35:44,824 --> 00:35:47,066
Just to meet the bare bones minimum.

377
00:35:47,826 --> 00:35:48,467
This year it's only 14%.

378
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,790
It was reported in the local press earlier this year.

379
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,731
You call the state house, they'll tell you the same thing.

380
00:35:54,412 --> 00:36:00,897
And you call, for which I had a long extensive conversation with the people in Boston, is call the CPA,

381
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:05,709
in Boston, their research people.

382
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:11,894
This is not, this is not to say I or anyone opposed to this.

383
00:36:12,415 --> 00:36:16,718
What I'm opposed to is the inequity that this is now presented here within our community.

384
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:18,820
And this inequity is not fair.

385
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:20,742
Because people are believing.

386
00:36:21,795 --> 00:36:28,777
If you're only given $180,000 back on the $1.24 million, well, all we're asking to do is to put this on hold.

387
00:36:29,617 --> 00:36:37,299
Metro taxpayers do not have to pay for this until such time that the Commonwealth meets its obligation for the purposes of giving the reimbursement.

388
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:39,319
That's what sold this program.

389
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:40,879
That's what people voted for.

390
00:36:41,179 --> 00:36:44,420
And that's what they believed that they were getting, a match from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

391
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,561
And unfortunately, it's not existing, and it's not there.

392
00:36:48,587 --> 00:36:50,307
That should have been told, that should have been explained.

393
00:36:50,347 --> 00:36:58,109
And I think, Mr. Clerk, you can attest to the fact over 1,200 people never turned their ballot over in 2015 to vote yes or no on the question itself.

394
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:03,871
So whether the people were not informed properly when they went to vote, or they just didn't want to vote, I don't know.

395
00:37:04,331 --> 00:37:05,231
But that's an awful lot.

396
00:37:05,611 --> 00:37:15,674
And I just think it takes into the serious consideration of today, hard times, people, water connectivity fee, water and sewer taxes, your tax rate keeps going up.

397
00:37:16,727 --> 00:37:20,070
new police station, new fire station, a library.

398
00:37:20,651 --> 00:37:22,012
Where is this money coming from?

399
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:26,736
And it's the most unfair way to go out and tax somebody right now on this issue.

400
00:37:26,776 --> 00:37:29,038
This is a state issue for which people went on

401
00:37:30,018 --> 00:37:38,546
I believe that this would be one way to at least mitigate until the Commonwealth of Mass gets its act together, either they're going to give the 100 percent back or they're not.

402
00:37:39,067 --> 00:37:43,511
Why should you deal with the idea that we'll—we guarantee 5 percent because that's what the law says?

403
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:44,512
Well, what's 5 percent?

404
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:45,893
That's meaningless.

405
00:37:46,334 --> 00:37:46,974
That is stupid.

406
00:37:48,155 --> 00:37:49,577
I'm more than happy to answer any questions.

407
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:55,554
If I could, I I did.

408
00:37:55,714 --> 00:38:11,601
I called the CPA on some of the questions that you'd ask in the answer that I was given that says there there is nothing in the CPA law nor on any state website or our website, nor in your local CPA ballot language that says that the state will match match will be 100 percent.

409
00:38:12,222 --> 00:38:19,465
In fact, all sources on the CPA are very clear on how the match works on the percentages from previous years.

410
00:38:19,894 --> 00:38:24,340
With all due respect, Rick, I have a folder here, and if you want to, I'll go over it with you, okay?

411
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:25,863
I'll go over it with you.

412
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:30,209
This first came across the city council in 1991, okay?

413
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:36,518
And in 1991, when this came out, when it became part of its first proposal, I think the then-Method City Council

414
00:38:36,938 --> 00:38:44,405
did not want to entertain it at the time because they felt it was another tax on the people, unfairly hitting them without having a say.

415
00:38:44,565 --> 00:38:46,426
And you only can put it in those four particular areas.

416
00:38:47,027 --> 00:38:48,748
Right now, okay, the people voted for it.

417
00:38:48,808 --> 00:38:49,429
We accept that.

418
00:38:49,469 --> 00:38:50,350
I got no problem with that.

419
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:55,274
But how do you continue to go forward and tax the people when you're not even getting the money back?

420
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:56,255
You're not even getting 50% of it back.

421
00:38:56,275 --> 00:38:57,756
You're only getting 14.5% of the money back.

422
00:38:57,776 --> 00:38:58,297
It's totally unfair.

423
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:11,531
And if you go to these other cities and towns and you talk to them like I have, a lot of them are not realizing it until you go in there and you start reading the information that they have there and how it's broken down.

424
00:39:11,912 --> 00:39:12,973
And I got volumes on this.

425
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:15,416
I don't sit home and read this for my health.

426
00:39:15,716 --> 00:39:16,678
I'm concerned about it.

427
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:18,520
I think it's an end run on Proposition 2.5.

428
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:20,723
If you continue to tax the people,

429
00:39:21,845 --> 00:39:22,665
at the way you're going.

430
00:39:23,305 --> 00:39:24,405
This is an alternative.

431
00:39:25,066 --> 00:39:29,346
It's a legitimate alternative that a city and town can pose, and until such time.

432
00:39:30,206 --> 00:39:38,288
And this is only good for five years, remember that, because the first year that you voted for was 15 to 16, and you had to get those numbers together, so you're not getting that money until 17.

433
00:39:39,528 --> 00:39:43,709
So the city method's only gonna get it for four of the five years on the CPA.

434
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:46,769
And then if it goes automatically after that, it'll be every year on and after that.

435
00:39:47,509 --> 00:39:50,190
But what I'm saying is at the end of the fifth year, Rick,

436
00:39:51,137 --> 00:40:01,122
the option would be that it ends, it becomes part of sunset legislation, and if the community wants to do it again, they put it on the ballot, like they did the first time, and the people can vote it up, or they can vote it down.

437
00:40:06,365 --> 00:40:07,286
Questions?

438
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:10,167
Motion to receive and place on file, Mr. President.

439
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:11,448
Mr. President, I, go ahead.

440
00:40:12,684 --> 00:40:13,425
Mr. President, if I could.

441
00:40:13,485 --> 00:40:14,126
Vice President Motz.

442
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:15,708
Thank you, Mr. President.

443
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:23,457
I agree with a lot of comments that Councilor Penter has made up there at the podium.

444
00:40:24,438 --> 00:40:32,467
When I talked to our own state delegation, many of them said that the program itself was a victim of its own success.

445
00:40:33,128 --> 00:40:40,271
When it originally started out, the match was much larger based on the number of communities that participated.

446
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:49,715
And over time, when communities found out that this may be workable in their community, they got added and the pool of money got lesser and lesser and so forth.

447
00:40:50,395 --> 00:41:01,039
I personally would like to see an organized target of our state delegation and the state legislature to say, why you created this program.

448
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,220
We didn't create the program.

449
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,362
This was created by the state legislature.

450
00:41:04,822 --> 00:41:07,725
Why are you not matching the fund?

451
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:10,367
Well, why are you not providing a decent match?

452
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:11,448
Even if it's not 100%, maybe 80, 75, 60%.

453
00:41:11,589 --> 00:41:13,090
But to go down to, as the council mentioned,

454
00:41:19,055 --> 00:41:28,802
14.5%, and if new communities are joining, it's going to be a point at some point, unless the state legislature acts, that there won't be a match at all.

455
00:41:29,602 --> 00:41:35,726
And I think people would have to revisit the issue again, because I vote with the will of the people.

456
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:41,410
The people voted for this, and we have it in the community, and as far as I'm concerned, we have to work with it and move forward.

457
00:41:42,471 --> 00:42:01,666
That doesn't prevent us from a legislative body in the community, and I would offer that tonight to send to our state delegation that we ask that the CPA fund be fully funded based on the need and the amount of communities that are anticipating into this program.

458
00:42:02,106 --> 00:42:11,033
And so I would offer that tonight, Mr. President, that that be one approach that we send a letter as the Memphis City Council.

459
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:14,314
And that was the suggestion from the head of the CPA.

460
00:42:14,674 --> 00:42:21,935
CPA was to seek to change state law chapter 44B as applies to all cities and towns.

461
00:42:22,735 --> 00:42:30,377
And they suggest that the petitioner submit their idea to the state delegation.

462
00:42:30,817 --> 00:42:31,897
That's what I'm asking here.

463
00:42:32,077 --> 00:42:34,197
Motion to sever the papers, Mr. President.

464
00:42:34,217 --> 00:42:35,878
Mr. President, what are the motions before us?

465
00:42:41,446 --> 00:42:44,067
It's just a petition, just a petition.

466
00:42:44,507 --> 00:42:45,187
What petition?

467
00:42:45,487 --> 00:42:47,287
It's not a motion.

468
00:42:47,307 --> 00:42:49,708
Because only a member of this body can make a motion, correct?

469
00:42:50,148 --> 00:42:50,628
That's correct.

470
00:42:50,728 --> 00:42:51,408
Thank you.

471
00:42:51,448 --> 00:42:57,490
But it's a petition, and they say it was the suggestion by the gentleman from the CPA.

472
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:58,690
Mr. Chase, I believe.

473
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,290
Yeah, no, I talked to Stewart.

474
00:43:01,411 --> 00:43:01,991
He was the head of it.

475
00:43:02,011 --> 00:43:02,891
He's the gentleman, right?

476
00:43:03,031 --> 00:43:06,792
Yeah, and he said that was the route to go through the state delegation.

477
00:43:06,992 --> 00:43:10,874
You could go through the state delegation, but you also could go through your local legislative body.

478
00:43:11,354 --> 00:43:13,155
That's why I said a local home will petition.

479
00:43:13,355 --> 00:43:14,296
I'd like to make one correction.

480
00:43:14,356 --> 00:43:14,576
I said 1991.

481
00:43:14,956 --> 00:43:18,698
It was 2001 when this first came up in the city of Medford.

482
00:43:19,148 --> 00:43:27,714
And from 2001, 2002, which was the first year, to 2007, the first five years, first six years, 100% went back to cities and towns.

483
00:43:28,215 --> 00:43:32,237
But they started off at 34, and then they went to 113 cities and towns.

484
00:43:32,738 --> 00:43:40,043
The next year, from 2008 going forward, you went from 127, now up to 176, and it's been downhill ever since.

485
00:43:40,563 --> 00:43:46,328
And again, we're just looking at equity, something that's fair to the Memphis taxpayer,

486
00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:54,292
especially the one that doesn't realize they're not getting it, that the state is not matching the money, as they said, and that's the term that they used.

487
00:43:54,312 --> 00:43:56,533
They were in Brooklyn when they sent it out, way back when.

488
00:43:56,993 --> 00:43:58,453
It broke down all the cities and towns.

489
00:43:59,294 --> 00:44:13,599
And like I said, I would just be asking respectfully that the council either forward this to the city solicitor and ask him if this could be done, and if not, then we go to the second row asking our state legislature.

490
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:15,340
If one of the councilors wants to make that motion?

491
00:44:18,192 --> 00:44:37,663
If the gentleman could just clarify if what can be done I know he According to if I could just finish If I know he mentioned by putting a hold on any collecting of monies in the community and also that the five-year commitment Once that ends that they go back on the ballot of those the two

492
00:44:39,572 --> 00:44:42,393
things that you want us to present to the city solicitor asking.

493
00:44:43,353 --> 00:44:57,556
Right in the letter it designates both sections of the law section to amend section 16a and section 16b of the sections 4 to 7 sections 3 to 7 of chapter 44 which this city accepted when they voted for the for the act in 2015.

494
00:45:00,476 --> 00:45:03,538
But the question to the city solicitor would be the legality of us.

495
00:45:03,718 --> 00:45:22,493
The legality of the law or if he would prepare legally a home rule petition that could be forwarded to our state legislators for the purposes of, again, this is not repealing it or getting rid of it, just to amend what's there until such time that the Commonwealth

496
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:25,030
figures out how to give us the 100% back.

497
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:28,551
Right, but you're also asking us to hold off on collections of any money.

498
00:45:29,071 --> 00:45:30,171
That's part of.

499
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:33,292
Right, right, and honestly at this point I don't feel comfortable.

500
00:45:33,573 --> 00:45:37,214
No, no, that's part of the proposal, not now, not doing it right now.

501
00:45:38,474 --> 00:45:49,278
Filing the piece of legislation that would allow cities and towns through their local legislative body to hold back collecting until 100% and then the second part would be if this were to be accepted and voted upon.

502
00:45:51,067 --> 00:45:51,867
Mr. De La Rosa.

503
00:45:51,927 --> 00:46:02,150
Mr. President, a number of people in our community put great efforts into proposing and working on this Community Preservation Act.

504
00:46:03,771 --> 00:46:10,913
Under my aegis as President, Council Knight was appointed to lead a task force in developing

505
00:46:11,533 --> 00:46:27,043
implementation program and ordinance with the assistance of the consultation of the city solicitor and the primary people involved in the leadership of this effort.

506
00:46:28,004 --> 00:46:33,648
Mr. President, none of them are here to consult us on this.

507
00:46:34,608 --> 00:46:36,209
None of them are here to advise us.

508
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:38,391
Quite frankly, I am

509
00:46:42,271 --> 00:46:51,484
have an expectation of expertise from them on these matters and questions, and they're not here to present to us.

510
00:46:51,604 --> 00:46:57,912
They've been duly appointed by this body, actually, to act as experts and leaders

511
00:46:58,593 --> 00:47:03,655
in matters regarding the Community Preservation Act in our community.

512
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:09,777
And in fact, they're meeting tonight at the Department of Public Works Conference Room.

513
00:47:10,258 --> 00:47:26,864
Mr. President, at this time, the only action I'm able to take, given our lack of input on this matter, and the matter of timing of removing from the table of this matter, is to receive and place on file or to return it to the table.

514
00:47:28,065 --> 00:47:33,814
If you allow me to read the advice given to me by the head of the CPA.

515
00:47:33,874 --> 00:47:36,959
It says, the petitioner is seeking to change the state law chapter 44B.

516
00:47:38,503 --> 00:47:43,226
and have and have the change apply to all cities and towns who adopt the CPA.

517
00:47:43,326 --> 00:47:44,007
That's incorrect.

518
00:47:44,147 --> 00:47:45,368
This is not what let me finish.

519
00:47:45,728 --> 00:47:47,749
This is not what a home home rule petition does.

520
00:47:48,209 --> 00:48:01,418
According to the Massachusetts Municipal Associate, a home rule petition is the is the process by which individual localities may petition state legislation affecting only the locality.

521
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:07,702
In fact, same article states that localities lack home rule power to regulate areas outside of

522
00:48:08,058 --> 00:48:09,939
municipalities, geographic limits.

523
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:16,684
If the petitioner seeks to change the state law, they should submit their idea for legislation to the state representative center.

524
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:20,447
All citizens have the right to ask legislators to file legislation.

525
00:48:20,887 --> 00:48:26,752
So that is the proper way for this person should put his idea before the state legislature.

526
00:48:27,132 --> 00:48:31,355
No city council action is required for a citizen to ask the legislator

527
00:48:32,183 --> 00:48:34,284
to file legislation to amend the state law.

528
00:48:34,744 --> 00:48:44,349
Since this is not a home petition, and since there is no action required by the city council, it may be appropriate to take the following action when you reach this item on the agenda.

529
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:47,991
One, I explained the procedure to you.

530
00:48:48,331 --> 00:48:54,835
Two, I can, we can rule this out of order, or just place on file because,

531
00:48:55,575 --> 00:48:59,619
What you're requesting doesn't involve the city council, it involves the state legislator.

532
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:04,784
If you read the last sentence of my paragraph, the intent of this home rule, local option petition.

533
00:49:05,144 --> 00:49:16,455
It's a local option petition filed if the city of Medford feels that they would like to go forward as a local option petition for which the people would have a chance to vote on it, so be it.

534
00:49:16,535 --> 00:49:17,576
If they don't have that option,

535
00:49:18,197 --> 00:49:23,363
than the local option, then we would take it to the legislature and have them file it for whatever the purposes might be.

536
00:49:23,823 --> 00:49:30,810
I'm presenting it because I really think it's sort of like unfair to tax these people, to tax our citizens.

537
00:49:31,131 --> 00:49:33,493
I said in 2013, $25 million was taken out of the surplus.

538
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:34,895
In 2014, $11.4 million was taken out of the state surplus.

539
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:43,363
And in 2015, $10 million was taken out of the state surplus.

540
00:49:43,764 --> 00:49:50,350
From 2016 forward, there's been no surplus and no money to be taken out, and all that's happening is people are being taxed.

541
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:54,333
Unfairly being taxed for something that they're not getting their money back on.

542
00:49:54,674 --> 00:49:58,677
It's like you going to the store and buying a new suit, okay?

543
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:04,162
And they said it's $199, you go there, it's $300 because they didn't tell you about all the other incidentals.

544
00:50:04,863 --> 00:50:05,443
It's not fair.

545
00:50:05,863 --> 00:50:11,185
All we're asking for is equity, fairness to this whole thing, and having an opportunity just to present it.

546
00:50:11,505 --> 00:50:13,786
Again, this is not to kill it, to squash it, or anything.

547
00:50:14,146 --> 00:50:18,308
It's just to bring equity until such time that the Commonwealth can prove, can prove.

548
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,348
Councilor Marks, you just said it.

549
00:50:20,409 --> 00:50:24,570
You spoke to someone up there, and they said they created something, they can't control it.

550
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:26,591
It's a monster that's out of control.

551
00:50:26,931 --> 00:50:29,752
But unfortunately, the ratepayers, the taxpayers, are paying for it.

552
00:50:30,572 --> 00:50:31,252
And that's not fair.

553
00:50:31,372 --> 00:50:32,553
I don't believe that that is fair.

554
00:50:34,989 --> 00:50:35,449
Mr. President?

555
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:36,330
Oh, it's so late.

556
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:40,173
The ballot question passed.

557
00:50:40,653 --> 00:50:41,954
Citizens in this community have spoken.

558
00:50:43,143 --> 00:50:48,307
Uh, the city council met, created an ad hoc committee on the implementation of the community preservation act.

559
00:50:49,268 --> 00:50:51,129
Um, we crafted a very strong ordinance.

560
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:52,850
We drafted a very strong ordinance, Mr. President.

561
00:50:53,771 --> 00:51:01,316
And just in recent months, this community preservation committee has been appointed and they're finally up and running and they're doing a really good job.

562
00:51:01,356 --> 00:51:06,260
And they're a very group of dedicated individuals that are really committed to the success of this program.

563
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,284
And I don't think we need to take steps as a council to undermine the efforts in the work that they're doing.

564
00:51:11,304 --> 00:51:11,784
Mr. President,

565
00:51:12,692 --> 00:51:15,213
I certainly support asking the state delegation to fully fund the paper.

566
00:51:15,873 --> 00:51:19,074
I certainly support asking the state delegation to fully fund the CPA match.

567
00:51:19,395 --> 00:51:20,815
I think that's a no-brainer, Mr. President.

568
00:51:20,855 --> 00:51:21,575
We all want more money.

569
00:51:21,956 --> 00:51:23,656
We all want more free money to come into our community.

570
00:51:23,676 --> 00:51:24,576
There's no doubt about that.

571
00:51:25,497 --> 00:51:29,198
But right now, we have an opportunity to build upon the successes of the work that we put in place.

572
00:51:29,558 --> 00:51:34,480
It's a grassroots effort and a grassroots campaign that came and brought the Community Preservation Act to our table, Mr. President.

573
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,001
It's something that was supported by the voters, that was passed by the voters.

574
00:51:37,521 --> 00:51:38,942
I'm not one that's going to stand in the way of that.

575
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:44,689
But ultimately, if we listen to the conversations that we've had here at the city council meetings, affordable housing is a topic that we've talked about.

576
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:49,931
I'm pretty sure councilor Scott Pelley has talked about recreation in the past quite a bit.

577
00:51:50,651 --> 00:51:52,772
I know councilor Longo-Curran has talked about historic preservation.

578
00:51:52,952 --> 00:51:54,493
These are three priorities of this council.

579
00:51:54,553 --> 00:51:56,774
Three things that we've been very, very focused on Mr. President.

580
00:51:57,049 --> 00:51:59,390
And there are three things that the CPA directly provides for.

581
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:06,113
So whether or not the match is 1%, 100%, 14.5%, I don't think we need to stand in the way of the success of our CPC.

582
00:52:06,513 --> 00:52:11,436
I think what we need to do is take a step back and let them do some of their work and let them see what the fruits of their labor is going to bear.

583
00:52:12,116 --> 00:52:13,817
So I, for one, Mr. President, would support

584
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:22,159
receiving this paper and placing it on file, supporting a B paper to ask our state delegation to fully fund the Community Preservation Act.

585
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:23,499
That was my motion, Mr. President.

586
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,600
Just the B paper is my motion.

587
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,700
Yeah, I'd absolutely support that.

588
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:27,921
I'd absolutely support that.

589
00:52:28,001 --> 00:52:28,501
I'd second that.

590
00:52:28,701 --> 00:52:32,342
So is Councilor Knight saying it's okay to tax the people without getting the adjust?

591
00:52:33,002 --> 00:52:35,163
redemption for why they voted for this?

592
00:52:35,323 --> 00:52:36,284
I think that's what he's saying.

593
00:52:36,324 --> 00:52:44,608
Mr. President, if I may, actually, what I'm saying is I think that some things are being a little bit misrepresented and misconstrued in the presentation, Mr. President.

594
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:50,872
What we need to do is take a step back and let the people that are appointed to do their job do their job and be successful at it and not stand in the way of it.

595
00:52:51,212 --> 00:52:54,115
and not interfere and impede the work that they're trying to do.

596
00:52:54,175 --> 00:52:59,320
Is Councilor Knight alleging that I'm spewing false information and that my statistics are wrong, that we're only getting 14%?

597
00:52:59,480 --> 00:52:59,800
Okay, 14.555%.

598
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:03,343
I don't think Councilor Knight is saying that.

599
00:53:03,403 --> 00:53:05,085
Well, I think you go back and listen to what he said.

600
00:53:05,746 --> 00:53:07,967
Why don't you go back and listen to it?

601
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:12,070
I don't think that's what Councillor Knight said.

602
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:24,257
I just can't believe that a board would want to continuously tax people in this room, in this community, knowing that it's wrong because the Commonwealth is not at least meeting its obligation.

603
00:53:24,478 --> 00:53:25,898
They can't even get to 50%, never mind 15%.

604
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,260
It's just wrong.

605
00:53:30,021 --> 00:53:36,383
Again, as was stated to me by the CPA, there was never anything in the law that says this will be matched at 100%.

606
00:53:36,683 --> 00:53:39,624
Rick, it's right there on the back of the card.

607
00:53:39,644 --> 00:53:40,524
It says matching funds.

608
00:53:40,564 --> 00:53:41,144
What's matching funds?

609
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:41,964
It says matching funds.

610
00:53:42,244 --> 00:53:44,165
It doesn't say at what percent.

611
00:53:45,285 --> 00:53:47,166
And that's, I can give you- Read the history.

612
00:53:47,526 --> 00:53:49,747
I'm going to give you a right from the CPA.

613
00:53:51,367 --> 00:53:52,287
There's nothing here that says 100%.

614
00:53:54,246 --> 00:53:55,788
It's in its original documents.

615
00:53:56,328 --> 00:54:03,255
If you have something that says 100% please show it to me and I will be happy to submit that to the CPA.

616
00:54:03,395 --> 00:54:11,243
I think when this was voted in and you can correct me if I'm wrong Mr. Penta, I believe it was 18% when this was voted in and I don't believe

617
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:17,072
That's what my was gonna be my question to you.

618
00:54:17,112 --> 00:54:18,012
What does the card say?

619
00:54:18,052 --> 00:54:22,336
Because when I had discussions with those advocating for the CPA, I was aware I was 18%.

620
00:54:22,396 --> 00:54:28,881
I think the bigger issue if you're gonna fight for or against it, it would be did people know it was on the back of the ballot?

621
00:54:30,382 --> 00:54:35,945
I mean, I knew it wasn't 100%, it was 18%, I believe, when we voted.

622
00:54:35,965 --> 00:54:36,826
2015, we voted, it was 29%.

623
00:54:36,866 --> 00:54:38,427
29%, oh gosh.

624
00:54:38,447 --> 00:54:38,427
29.67%.

625
00:54:38,487 --> 00:54:41,088
Then I think it went down to 18, now it's 14, so.

626
00:54:41,188 --> 00:54:43,490
Yeah, it went down to 20, and now we're down to 14.5.

627
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:48,052
Maybe that's where, Councilman, it was just talking about the information, whether or not, what was on the card.

628
00:54:54,033 --> 00:54:58,456
On the motion by Mr. President, Mr. Vice President Max.

629
00:55:00,578 --> 00:55:06,541
I'm sorry, would you like to yield the, would you like to yield the floor to the people behind you?

630
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:31,432
Name and address of the record, please A couple of things that I've heard tonight are that the people voted for this and I have some disagreement with that the people I talked to didn't vote for it they didn't have any understanding of what was going on and I think I'm pretty much out there and

631
00:55:32,098 --> 00:55:36,239
And I would be embarrassed to admit that I didn't understand.

632
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:42,320
So for people who voted for it, they maybe did understand.

633
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:46,861
Maybe they're the people who end up with jobs and they think this is a good thing.

634
00:55:47,601 --> 00:55:59,123
But for people, I would say the average person, when you look at how few people actually did vote for it, not many people did, including me, who thinks that I know what I'm doing.

635
00:56:00,172 --> 00:56:12,360
So I also am very concerned about talk about affordable housing and bringing more people in and traffic and more people in the schools.

636
00:56:13,701 --> 00:56:18,924
And if you're going around anywhere around Wellington, it's like a nightmare.

637
00:56:20,302 --> 00:56:24,526
And when Wegmans comes in, it's going to be much worse.

638
00:56:26,128 --> 00:56:27,309
And the casino.

639
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:39,039
And I have spoken to a few people in Boston who, because I said 1.5%, where's our 1.5%?

640
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:45,485
And they said, very seriously, the state doesn't have the money and the state can't send it.

641
00:56:46,124 --> 00:56:48,447
And it's nothing to do with we don't like Medford.

642
00:56:48,948 --> 00:56:52,712
We simply don't have the money and we're simply not going to send the money.

643
00:56:53,613 --> 00:56:58,019
So I think it's quite reasonable to say we're not going to get the money.

644
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,941
They can't send the money.

645
00:57:00,181 --> 00:57:02,084
We're only going to get a little bit of money.

646
00:57:02,849 --> 00:57:14,935
And I agree with Mr. Penta that you're taxing, I think, a few people who voted for this, and most people who didn't vote for this, and they're not very happy.

647
00:57:15,175 --> 00:57:24,299
I don't know exactly what the statistics are, who voted and who didn't vote, but I think most people didn't vote for it, and they're not very happy.

648
00:57:24,519 --> 00:57:28,601
I mean, Democrat, Republican, Independent, people don't like taxes.

649
00:57:29,181 --> 00:57:30,422
And then when you talk,

650
00:57:31,142 --> 00:57:32,964
More taxes, oh my God.

651
00:57:34,105 --> 00:57:49,177
So I think there are things we need to do, but everybody I know is very concerned about the police station, the fire station, the library, and the roads and sidewalks.

652
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:53,761
I've been into the senior center and the seniors are always the sidewalks, the sidewalks.

653
00:57:54,661 --> 00:57:57,183
And when you're spending money on all these things,

654
00:57:58,167 --> 00:57:59,808
I mean, people just can't do it.

655
00:57:59,908 --> 00:58:01,569
They really just can't do it.

656
00:58:01,609 --> 00:58:03,330
They're very, very unhappy.

657
00:58:05,211 --> 00:58:07,632
So I support what Mr. Prentiss said.

658
00:58:07,672 --> 00:58:09,913
I think it's a reasonable solution.

659
00:58:10,493 --> 00:58:13,134
Now, one other thing, which is a totally different subject.

660
00:58:13,835 --> 00:58:18,437
I was trying to figure out where to go tonight, and I knew Tuesday was city council.

661
00:58:19,298 --> 00:58:21,819
So I called the mayor, and yes, this is city council.

662
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:23,740
There's also a zoning meeting,

663
00:58:24,942 --> 00:58:27,947
And there's also a meeting at Hanes about money.

664
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:32,855
And then on the website is the CPA at the DPW.

665
00:58:34,359 --> 00:58:37,121
And I know somebody who was gonna go there but is gonna go here.

666
00:58:37,201 --> 00:58:42,866
Then now, I called the mayor's office and they said that one isn't going to be, so I don't know whether it is.

667
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:46,588
But I'm good, but I can't be in four places at once.

668
00:58:46,769 --> 00:58:49,290
And I can't also be in three places at once.

669
00:58:49,671 --> 00:58:52,393
And I don't feel like the mayor really cares about me.

670
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:54,655
But you guys have power.

671
00:58:55,275 --> 00:59:01,660
And I was thinking you could send a little email to the mayor and say, you know, if Tuesday night is gonna be city council,

672
00:59:02,353 --> 00:59:05,155
then let's not have another meeting on Tuesday night.

673
00:59:05,656 --> 00:59:07,357
I think that would be a reasonable thing.

674
00:59:08,518 --> 00:59:10,660
And that's it for me, unless you have any questions.

675
00:59:14,823 --> 00:59:16,805
Citizen Castanetti wishes to address.

676
00:59:16,825 --> 00:59:17,826
Name and address of the record, please.

677
00:59:18,386 --> 00:59:25,933
Andrew Castanetti, 23 Cushing Street, former Memphis City Council candidate.

678
00:59:26,433 --> 00:59:27,914
The lady brought up a good point.

679
00:59:29,035 --> 00:59:31,017
The city has a scheduling problem.

680
00:59:32,222 --> 00:59:34,684
We cannot be in more than one location at one time.

681
00:59:36,967 --> 00:59:39,869
I wanted to go to something about Hang Square.

682
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:41,311
We are on the CPA.

683
00:59:41,571 --> 00:59:43,373
Yeah, it would be nice to have meetings.

684
00:59:43,573 --> 00:59:44,454
We're on the CPA though.

685
00:59:44,474 --> 00:59:45,115
Thank you.

686
00:59:45,155 --> 00:59:48,498
If you want to speak about scheduling, come back later in the evening.

687
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:50,179
I'm just talking about scratch one.

688
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:51,721
But there should not be a question.

689
00:59:51,741 --> 00:59:52,502
We're doing CPA first.

690
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:53,543
Okay, about the CPA.

691
00:59:55,168 --> 01:00:02,575
My comprehension of past facts on the CPA vote, number one, in effect, it's an override of proposition two and a half.

692
01:00:04,336 --> 01:00:17,808
Number two, I believe approximately 5,555 people voted for the mayor in the past election, and about 5,000 voted for the runner-up.

693
01:00:18,889 --> 01:00:19,730
It came out to about 10,500.

694
01:00:23,768 --> 01:00:42,060
but approximately only 8,000 voted for the CPA tax, including renters were allowed, approximately, including the renters were allowed to vote for it, Mr. Finn.

695
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,982
And it was passed by a narrow margin, I believe.

696
01:00:47,724 --> 01:00:50,045
Mr. Finn, do you have the margin that it passed by?

697
01:00:51,646 --> 01:00:52,186
Can we talk?

698
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:56,340
56% of 44%.

699
01:00:57,161 --> 01:01:03,984
So there's a narrow margin, in my opinion.

700
01:01:05,464 --> 01:01:17,409
Number three, why did they only require approximately 1,700 signatures to get the CPA question on the ballot?

701
01:01:20,275 --> 01:01:31,198
But we, the average people or person, we need 20% of the registered voters, which is about approximately 7,000 signatures to get something on the ballot.

702
01:01:36,219 --> 01:01:41,860
And also, I believe some people were involved with gathering the petitions, worked for City Hall.

703
01:01:44,521 --> 01:01:47,062
A director of a certain department, I noticed, was involved.

704
01:01:47,082 --> 01:01:48,182
We can't speak for that.

705
01:01:48,822 --> 01:01:52,344
I'm not sure if that was legal, but I'll be quiet about that right now.

706
01:01:55,626 --> 01:02:02,091
Number four, however, I'm not very upset at the extra $60 a year for my real estate tax bill.

707
01:02:02,871 --> 01:02:17,781
I'm more concerned I'm three real estate tax bills in arrears at the tune of $4,500, plus fine, plus 14% per annum juice interest, because some of us are struggling to pay our bills.

708
01:02:18,997 --> 01:02:42,296
Number five, also I'm most concerned where most of this money will be spent, meaning outside of the West Medford area, we have South Medford, East Medford, Fulton Heights, and I believe these other areas have greater need to improve our quality of life, period.

709
01:02:43,097 --> 01:02:44,078
And finally, number six,

710
01:02:45,153 --> 01:02:51,477
And of course, the so-called matching state funds was and is a fallacy, period, again.

711
01:02:51,997 --> 01:02:53,117
Thank you, if you're listening.

712
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:55,459
Thank you.

713
01:02:55,479 --> 01:02:56,299
Mr. Hoyer, personal?

714
01:02:56,359 --> 01:02:58,060
Councilor Del Rosso.

715
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:04,344
I just wanna thank the last speaker for his regular reference to East Medford.

716
01:03:04,684 --> 01:03:06,565
Thank you.

717
01:03:06,585 --> 01:03:12,508
The letter that you wrote from the gentleman from the CPA incorrectly states that this was a petition to apply to all cities and towns.

718
01:03:12,568 --> 01:03:12,969
It was not.

719
01:03:13,993 --> 01:03:15,234
And that basically.

720
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:16,835
That's what he wrote back to me.

721
01:03:16,855 --> 01:03:17,355
That's what he wrote?

722
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:17,856
That's what he wrote.

723
01:03:17,876 --> 01:03:20,757
Apparently you didn't translate it properly, or you didn't understand it properly.

724
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,639
I kind of transparent what you said to me to make sure that.

725
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:29,063
But apparently it was wrong because I don't want anyone to be misled to think that I'm asking this for all cities and towns.

726
01:03:29,503 --> 01:03:34,586
It was just for the city of Medford, a local community home rule petition option.

727
01:03:37,848 --> 01:03:40,090
On the motion by Vice President Marks,

728
01:03:42,382 --> 01:03:43,563
I'm sorry, did you want to speak?

729
01:03:44,603 --> 01:03:44,823
Yes.

730
01:03:46,244 --> 01:03:47,664
My name is Carolyn Jones.

731
01:03:49,185 --> 01:03:52,846
I try to come to... Can we have your address, please?

732
01:03:52,866 --> 01:03:54,847
32 Arlington Street in West Medford.

733
01:03:54,907 --> 01:03:56,207
Thank you.

734
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,748
I try to come to some of the meetings.

735
01:03:59,229 --> 01:04:02,230
My health hasn't been that great, so I can't always get to all of them.

736
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:10,493
But I'm concerned about the increase in taxes, about the emphasis on

737
01:04:11,256 --> 01:04:22,440
the changes in Medford from the few meetings that I've been to, the emphasis seems to be on younger people rather than the entire community.

738
01:04:24,101 --> 01:04:29,843
And I'd like to see something that happens when, where you can have more people who come out to the city council meetings.

739
01:04:30,383 --> 01:04:46,052
that there's more information that's in the transcript so that people know that when they come to a meeting, they know what's going to occur at the meeting, they know what's happened in the past, and they can be or feel more readily

740
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:48,758
able to express their opinions.

741
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:52,021
I don't have that problem because I express my opinions all the time.

742
01:04:54,002 --> 01:05:05,409
But I think that what needs to happen is that the information needs to be more direct when it comes out to

743
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:34,119
the residents of Medford, that there's not just a little card that comes out, but there is something, whether it's in the transcript, whether it's in the mercury, something on a weekly basis that can be an outline of what's going on, whether it's an increase in taxes, and encourage the people who live in West Medford and pay for taxes in West Medford to feel free to come to these meetings, to talk to all of you,

744
01:05:35,253 --> 01:05:37,014
to let you know what our feelings are.

745
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:47,459
I mean, I'm one of the people who doesn't like to see my taxes go up, and that's just because I am retired now, and so I have a fixed income.

746
01:05:48,479 --> 01:05:52,001
And I don't like to go into my extra money unless I absolutely have to.

747
01:05:52,561 --> 01:05:55,163
I guess I got kind of stingy when I got older.

748
01:05:56,435 --> 01:05:58,056
how I was going to spend my money.

749
01:05:58,717 --> 01:06:20,973
But I just think that I would like to see something that encourages more people in the community to come out to these meetings and for more people in the community to really have some good information when they come to the meetings so that they can ask reasonable questions and hope to get reasonable answers from those of you who are on city council.

750
01:06:22,414 --> 01:06:23,255
That's all I have to say.

751
01:06:23,295 --> 01:06:23,555
Thank you.

752
01:06:25,775 --> 01:06:30,458
On the motion by Vice President Mox, Mr. Clerk, if you could read that motion back.

753
01:06:30,478 --> 01:06:42,985
It was a letter to the state delegation on fully funding the match.

754
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:45,166
Is that correct?

755
01:06:45,446 --> 01:06:45,827
That's correct.

756
01:06:45,847 --> 01:06:46,867
That's the B paper.

757
01:06:46,927 --> 01:06:47,788
That's the B paper.

758
01:06:49,128 --> 01:06:49,849
And the A paper?

759
01:06:52,297 --> 01:06:55,158
is the petition to be received and placed.

760
01:06:55,298 --> 01:06:56,758
We see we received the place and file.

761
01:06:59,059 --> 01:07:03,781
So there's no appetite here to send this to the city solicitor for the purposes of reviewing.

762
01:07:04,741 --> 01:07:07,022
So what we're saying is just keep taxing the people.

763
01:07:07,762 --> 01:07:12,644
So if somebody wants to make the motion to do that, what would you do it, Mr. President?

764
01:07:12,924 --> 01:07:14,164
I'm the president.

765
01:07:14,184 --> 01:07:15,765
You have six other counselors in the question.

766
01:07:19,967 --> 01:07:34,634
I would be amendable to send this to a subcommittee where we can invite members of the CPA committee, where we can invite the city solicitor, and we can have a discussion and dialogue around the suggestions made by the petitioner.

767
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:41,558
So I have no problem in discussing any issue that comes before this council, Mr. President.

768
01:07:41,578 --> 01:07:44,860
So I would make a recommendation that this be sent to the

769
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:48,563
which is the best committee.

770
01:07:49,063 --> 01:07:53,628
Economic development.

771
01:07:53,668 --> 01:07:54,149
Legislative.

772
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:56,231
I think we have a legislative committee, don't we?

773
01:07:57,658 --> 01:08:03,662
Whatever committee, it doesn't matter to me as long as the committee gets together and meets on the issue.

774
01:08:03,702 --> 01:08:06,683
I'll do a committee of the whole.

775
01:08:06,723 --> 01:08:07,804
If you want to do that, it's fine too.

776
01:08:07,864 --> 01:08:12,206
So it'll be on motion to send this to a committee of the whole?

777
01:08:12,346 --> 01:08:21,591
And make sure that members of the CPA are invited, the city solicitor, and that residents of the community are duly notified for their input as well, Mr. President.

778
01:08:22,591 --> 01:08:25,393
On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by

779
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,735
To have a council of the whole of the committee of the whole meeting.

780
01:08:34,616 --> 01:08:35,157
Seconded by.

781
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:35,918

Two in the affirmative and none in the negative.

801
01:09:05,488 --> 01:09:06,128

Councilor Knight?

818
01:09:35,258 --> 01:09:35,458
Yes.

819
01:09:36,198 --> 01:09:36,859
Councilor Kern?

820
01:09:36,879 --> 01:09:37,079
Yes.

821
01:09:37,599 --> 01:09:38,280
Vice President Marks?

822
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:38,640
Yes.

823
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:39,781
Councilor Scarpelli?

824
01:09:39,901 --> 01:09:40,141
Yes.

825
01:09:40,161 --> 01:09:41,262
Vice President Calvelli?

826
01:09:41,342 --> 01:09:41,582
Yes.

827
01:09:42,423 --> 01:09:44,764
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

828
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:46,025
Motion passes.

829
01:09:46,465 --> 01:09:47,246
Thank you, Mr. Penta.

830
01:09:47,366 --> 01:09:48,587
We're on to suspension, Mr. President.

831
01:09:48,607 --> 01:09:49,267
Paper number 7661. 7661.

832
01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:14,575
17, 6, 6, 1, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that in the interest of public safety and emergency response, the Traffic Commission implement no parking between Rice Avenue and Willard Avenue on the odd numbered side of Willis Avenue.

833
01:10:15,215 --> 01:10:15,876
Councilor Knight.

834
01:10:16,376 --> 01:10:17,697
Mr. President, thank you very much.

835
01:10:17,757 --> 01:10:23,382
In front of the stretch of homes between Rice and Willard along Willis Avenue on the odd numbered side,

836
01:10:23,882 --> 01:10:27,743
You'll see that it's very difficult for one vehicle to get by when cars are parked on each side of the street.

837
01:10:28,364 --> 01:10:34,506
In the audience today, we do have a homeowner that lives along that stretch who's contacted me and asked that we move this matter forward.

838
01:10:34,966 --> 01:10:46,130
Ultimately, the residents at 195-197 Willis Ave had a yellow painting in front of the curb, connotating that no parking was supposed to occur there.

839
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:47,930
And over time, that paint wore off.

840
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:52,792
I reached out and contacted the Traffic Commission in consultation with Councilor Moxley, who's been working on this with me.

841
01:10:53,329 --> 01:10:55,732
and we spoke with members of the Traffic Commission.

842
01:10:55,772 --> 01:10:57,433
The Traffic Commission went down and took a look at it.

843
01:10:57,453 --> 01:10:59,435
The DPW painted a certain stretch of the curb.

844
01:11:00,196 --> 01:11:16,012
However, they weren't able to paint the curb the entire length of Willis between Rice and Willard, and they also rendered the impression that even though the curb was yellow, if people parked there, the police weren't gonna do anything about it so that the appropriate steps that needed to be taken in order to address this public safety concern would be to put a no parking sign up.

845
01:11:16,687 --> 01:11:33,659
Um, however, um, the archaic and arcane way that we do signage in the city of Medford means that the individual homeowners who was aggrieved by this public safety concern is now asked to get a petition and go knock on doors and ask their neighbors to sign a petition, um, to address this public safety issue.

846
01:11:33,699 --> 01:11:35,440
And I don't think that that's right, Mr. President.

847
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:39,523
I think that clearly there's a need, uh, clearly there's a public safety concern.

848
01:11:40,197 --> 01:11:59,443
and I put this resolution forward to request that the Traffic Commission take the appropriate steps to put the parking restrictions in place so that the individuals that reside on the stretch of roadway can feel safe and comfortable and know that if a fire engine or an ambulance is called to their home, that the fire engine or the ambulance can make it down the street to get to their home to bring them the life-saving care that they need, Mr. President.

849
01:11:59,463 --> 01:12:05,105
So it's a very simple and basic resolution, and it's really cut out of the cloth for the interest of public safety and emergency preparedness.

850
01:12:05,545 --> 01:12:05,865
Thank you.

851
01:12:06,205 --> 01:12:07,926
Mr. President, Councilor Dela Russa.

852
01:12:08,226 --> 01:12:16,630
I'm very familiar with that situation and Councilor Knight's assessment is very accurate and I support this motion.

853
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:17,210
Thank you.

854
01:12:17,511 --> 01:12:18,211
Vice President Marks.

855
01:12:18,931 --> 01:12:19,892
Thank you, Mr. President.

856
01:12:21,012 --> 01:12:33,198
This particular condition exists all around the community and anyone that goes down Willis Ave would say, how can you honestly allow parking anywhere, Willis Ave with two-way traffic?

857
01:12:33,978 --> 01:12:38,761
It's tough enough to get down the street just with the two-way traffic, but then we have a car park there.

858
01:12:39,061 --> 01:12:40,202
It's almost impossible.

859
01:12:41,263 --> 01:12:46,766
And these are the issues that we really need to be examined by the Traffic Commission, Mr. President.

860
01:12:47,467 --> 01:12:58,254
And I would ask fully that this be supported here tonight and sent to the Traffic Commission for immediate action, Mr. President, on this basis.

861
01:12:59,234 --> 01:12:59,875
Thank you.

862
01:13:00,355 --> 01:13:01,076
How's this guy belly?

863
01:13:01,156 --> 01:13:01,496
Thank you.

864
01:13:01,516 --> 01:13:02,497
Mr. President.

865
01:13:02,517 --> 01:13:14,545
I concur with all of my colleagues I did receive a phone call today and I did take a ride down to Willis and it's it's It is a mess.

866
01:13:14,585 --> 01:13:20,830
So I think that we really need to That's as a traffic engineer stats pretty soon.

867
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:22,611
Hopefully these are one of the

868
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:37,425
dangerous areas, I mean, Willis is notorious for many accidents up and down Willis Ave, so I think that I support this resolution, and I appreciate Council and I bring this forward.

869
01:13:37,806 --> 01:13:38,126
So thank you.

870
01:13:38,146 --> 01:13:38,426
Thank you.

871
01:13:38,446 --> 01:13:40,387
Name and address of the record, please.

872
01:13:40,527 --> 01:13:42,127
Pamela D'Andrea, 197 Willis Avenue.

873
01:13:44,008 --> 01:13:52,078
I brought this up to Mr. Knight because I'm in that house three, I'm in this city 45 years, but I'm only in that house three years.

874
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:54,761
And it's right across the street from the projects.

875
01:13:55,262 --> 01:14:03,011
The problem with the parking is the people in the projects who don't live there and don't have a permit to park in there.

876
01:14:03,467 --> 01:14:06,770
And then they park in front of my house, in front of my friend's house.

877
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:09,111
Nobody can get in and out of their driveways.

878
01:14:09,652 --> 01:14:17,378
And Willis Avenue is not wide enough to be parking on both sides of the street, anywhere on Willis Avenue.

879
01:14:17,978 --> 01:14:24,803
I had two DBW guys come down and say they were going in and out on Willis Avenue because people were parked on both sides of the street.

880
01:14:25,064 --> 01:14:26,225
It's a safety issue.

881
01:14:26,725 --> 01:14:30,588
We had a car fire across the street from us in front of the projects.

882
01:14:31,193 --> 01:14:37,575
And this guy that parks in front of my house all the time was parked there and the fire truck barely made it through.

883
01:14:38,255 --> 01:14:39,435
It's a safety hazard.

884
01:14:39,755 --> 01:14:40,976
We've had accidents there.

885
01:14:41,416 --> 01:14:43,556
My mother-in-law, we had to take her to the hospital.

886
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:48,358
Because this guy was parked there, the fire truck and the ambulance could not get down the street.

887
01:14:48,638 --> 01:14:52,539
They had to drag her to the corner to get to the hospital.

888
01:14:52,859 --> 01:14:53,439
It's not right.

889
01:14:54,075 --> 01:14:58,877
And you really, people should put no parking signs all the way up and down both there.

890
01:14:59,577 --> 01:15:02,738
Because they shouldn't be parking on both sides of the street.

891
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:13,422
The people in the projects need to know that there's a law, and I'm telling you, as soon as that sign goes up and somebody parks there, I'm on the phone.

892
01:15:13,822 --> 01:15:16,343
They're going to get told so fast it isn't going to be funny.

893
01:15:17,643 --> 01:15:19,604
Because I've been watching this now for three years.

894
01:15:20,144 --> 01:15:22,105
And I thank you people for supporting this.

895
01:15:22,875 --> 01:15:24,476
Thank you for coming.

896
01:15:24,516 --> 01:15:25,957
Councilor Lococo.

897
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:39,824
Just briefly, I think everybody's said what they need to say, but maybe just have the traffic commission also evaluate the entire road, possibility of making it parking on one side, if it is pretty thin.

898
01:15:40,924 --> 01:15:45,987
You want to amend the paper with the traffic commission to evaluate making it one way?

899
01:15:46,267 --> 01:15:47,367
I mean, parking on one side?

900
01:15:49,463 --> 01:16:18,830

901
01:16:21,252 --> 01:16:22,913
Thank you very much.

902
01:16:22,973 --> 01:16:25,735
Motion to revert back to regular business.

903
01:16:26,096 --> 01:16:32,501
If I could yield the chair to Mr. Vice President Marks for the first one, seeing that it's sponsored by me.

904
01:16:33,446 --> 01:17:00,324
Sure, paper 17-654 offered by President Caviello, whereas the deteriorated hazardous condition of the public walkway from the driveway entrance at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway to Locust Street poses a serious hazard to pedestrian traffic, and the lack of adequate lighting makes the specified public walkway more dangerous for pedestrians to navigate between the hours of sunset and sunrise,

905
01:17:01,164 --> 01:17:26,420
Whereas excessive overgrowth from trees and low-hanging branches along the public passageway presents an additional challenge to pedestrians, therefore be it resolved that the Memphis City Council respectfully request that the Department of Conservation and Recreation take immediate action to repair, reconstruct the public passageway from the driveway entrance of 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway to Locust Street.

906
01:17:27,004 --> 01:17:38,972
Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council request immediate action to be taken to install adequate lighting to illuminate the public passageway from 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway to Locust Street, Medford.

907
01:17:39,472 --> 01:17:47,257
Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council request the overgrowth along the passageway and low hanging branches from the trees be trimmed.

908
01:17:47,777 --> 01:17:48,398
Council President.

909
01:17:49,411 --> 01:17:50,011
Thank you, Mr. President.

910
01:17:51,373 --> 01:18:00,360
With the implementation of awakements coming in, you're going to see more and more people walking to the new shopping center.

911
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:10,187
And if anyone's been over to that area, you can see that it's very dark at night and the sidewalks are kind of beat up and the trees are hanging.

912
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:15,111
So it's my recommendation that we contact our state delegation, Senator Jalen and

913
01:18:17,473 --> 01:18:30,742
Representative Barber to have the DCI go over there, inspect the sidewalk, and look at the feasibility of maybe putting a couple of street lights in there to help out the people that are going to be walking to the supermarket.

914
01:18:31,823 --> 01:18:37,386
It is dark there, and you'll be having people from the other movement walking over also.

915
01:18:37,447 --> 01:18:42,050
So if we could have some lights, and hopefully looking at the sidewalk.

916
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:46,132
trimming the trees so make it be a little easier for them to walk there.

917
01:18:49,194 --> 01:18:55,558
Thank you.

918
01:18:55,598 --> 01:18:55,858
Second.

919
01:18:56,418 --> 01:18:57,839
Councilor Felco second.

920
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,040
Councilor Scarpelli.

921
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,060
All those in favor?

922
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:00,480
Aye.

923
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,261
Opposed?

924
01:19:01,281 --> 01:19:01,961
The ayes have it.

925
01:19:02,021 --> 01:19:03,022
The motion is adopted.

926
01:19:03,402 --> 01:19:05,383
Thank you Mr. Vice President.

927
01:19:05,403 --> 01:19:08,105
17.655 offered by Councilor Lueb and O'Kerrin.

928
01:19:08,915 --> 01:19:15,480
We have resolved that the city looks into working with a group like team better block to engage in temporary scenarios in Medford Square.

929
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:24,367
The MAPC is currently working with 101 communities, and it would be nice to also work with a company that focuses solely on Medford.

930
01:19:24,407 --> 01:19:25,368
Councilor Lungo-Kern.

931
01:19:25,588 --> 01:19:27,469
Thank you, President Carviello.

932
01:19:27,489 --> 01:19:30,732
In other cities and towns, they use different companies such as

933
01:19:32,064 --> 01:19:35,787
Team Better Block, which was brought to my attention and I did some research on it.

934
01:19:36,728 --> 01:19:46,617
It's a way, in addition to what the MAPC has been doing for Medford Square and has done for Medford Square, what Team Better Block, I know that the new developments at

935
01:19:50,040 --> 01:20:02,172
area at Union Square has used that company, Team Better Block, and I know there are other companies, so I just want to ask the administration if that's something that we've looked into, or if not, if we can look into it.

936
01:20:02,972 --> 01:20:28,721
Team Better Block is a company that comes in and they focus 100% of their energy on Medford, and they would do, like they've done in other cities and towns across the United States, they would do temporary scenarios, so wouldn't necessarily, and they would engage the public and the community, figure out ways to include, almost along the same lines of what we're trying to include, public space, public art,

937
01:20:29,441 --> 01:20:53,650
bump-outs, temporary crosswalks, but this is almost on a temporary basis, so we can not only get input and take surveys of what the city of Medford wants and what our residents want, but you would, they create bump-outs and crosswalks, all different types of public spaces, public green space as a temporary,

938
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:56,711
fix to see how it works.

939
01:20:57,172 --> 01:21:10,239
And they would do it in all different areas, obviously different areas within Medford Square, and if it worked, obviously you can go to South Medford and West Medford, just to engage the public in ways that aren't

940
01:21:10,879 --> 01:21:23,130
so permanent, where people get an idea of, oh, wow, if we did do these bumbouts, they're not as scary as they seemed, or not as drastic as they seemed when it was, you know, going to be a permanent thing.

941
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:33,039
Let people understand the ideas that NAACP has come up with, and Team Better Block obviously comes up with additional ideas and additional ways to make it happen.

942
01:21:33,559 --> 01:21:51,267
I know they did a project, I believe, on the west coast, and it cost a couple thousand dollars to do a large section of a city square on a temporary basis, and the life it created and the community that it created, I think, would be beneficial.

943
01:21:51,327 --> 01:21:52,188
They would focus 100% on Medford.

944
01:21:53,488 --> 01:22:22,742
I'm not sure of the cost, that's one thing that I just didn't research yet, but to actually do the temporary scenarios is very inexpensive, and it's somebody that would focus just on Medford, just on Medford Square, where we do need the revitalization, where people do want, do wanna see change, they wanna see more activity, more green space, more public art, more open space, and we're going there, it's just, we can't afford everything all at once, and this would be a way to say,

945
01:22:23,442 --> 01:22:38,415
These are the five things that we can try out, see if they work, and then if it is working and we are able to get the community involved and happy about these different scenarios, we can make it happen as a permanent fix, a permanent change.

946
01:22:38,936 --> 01:22:43,440
So it's just one idea that has come, was brought to my attention, and I think

947
01:22:44,441 --> 01:22:52,619
I don't think see any harm in doing some research on it and seeing if we can look into hiring some sort of company to do this type of work for us.

948
01:22:55,293 --> 01:22:56,053
Councilor Dela Russo.

949
01:22:56,333 --> 01:23:22,963
This idea was presented at the meeting we had on the master plan unveiling a couple weeks ago and I know that this was presented as an option from some citizens and that the mayor was aware of this and is eager to look into this and equally energetic about this matter and these options as the

950
01:23:23,903 --> 01:23:32,068
Director of our Community Development Office, Lauren.

951
01:23:32,108 --> 01:23:41,875
If we could request just an update with regards to what has been done to hire or research companies like Team Better Block and what our plan is going forward.

952
01:23:42,636 --> 01:23:43,877
just so we can have an awareness.

953
01:23:43,937 --> 01:24:03,093
I mean, I've only researched the one company for, you know, an hour on the internet, watched a bunch of videos and seen actually what work they've done, and there's a lot more than obviously other companies, but what has the city administration done to use more than MAPC that is working with over 100 other communities?

954
01:24:03,193 --> 01:24:05,434
I mean, somebody to focus just on Medford.

955
01:24:05,454 --> 01:24:09,458
A public meeting is great, you know, on a Wednesday night, but to have,

956
01:24:10,038 --> 01:24:36,469
people somebody that will survey and get the community involved and active and it is a community team better buck uses the computer community to create these spaces and if we could get that done I think it would be beneficial to the you know in to use it going forward and all our squares is gonna be beneficial to the city of Medford so we get an update on where we're at if we've started researching that and if we're gonna move forward with such an option

957
01:24:36,945 --> 01:24:37,225
Thank you.

958
01:24:37,465 --> 01:24:37,945
Councilor Knight.

959
01:24:38,385 --> 01:24:39,666
Mr. President, thank you very much.

960
01:24:39,706 --> 01:24:42,146
I'd like to thank the councilor for bringing this resolution forward.

961
01:24:42,947 --> 01:24:46,028
Ultimately, I don't think it's any secret in this community.

962
01:24:46,068 --> 01:24:47,468
We need to do something with Medford Square.

963
01:24:48,168 --> 01:24:49,348
And this is just another approach.

964
01:24:50,009 --> 01:24:55,870
I think that right now, our redevelopment focus on Medford Square is a leave no stone unturned approach.

965
01:24:55,930 --> 01:25:00,191
And this is just another tool in the toolbox for us to take a look at, Mr. President, and see if we can make a difference down there.

966
01:25:00,231 --> 01:25:01,892
So I support it wholeheartedly and move approval.

967
01:25:04,318 --> 01:25:04,918
Mr. President.

968
01:25:05,739 --> 01:25:06,539
Vice President Mox.

969
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:17,045
Just if I could and I think anything that can supplement an office of community development right now which is understaffed Mr. President I think would be helpful.

970
01:25:18,125 --> 01:25:22,368
It was mentioned at that meeting also and I hope the mayor takes heed to this

971
01:25:22,988 --> 01:25:27,091
that the office of community development staff has not changed since 2005.

972
01:25:27,231 --> 01:25:31,835
We still have the same inadequate staffing since 2005.

973
01:25:32,095 --> 01:25:38,900
That's 12 years and now we're looking into one of the largest revitalizations of

974
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:58,383
our business district and we still have the same understaffed office, Mr. President, and I think is ill-equipped to move this project forward, to be quite frank with you, and I think there has to be a focus by this administration to look into the Office of Community Development because their main goal and focus

975
01:25:58,883 --> 01:26:04,170
is to bring in new business into the community and revitalize our business districts.

976
01:26:04,811 --> 01:26:11,400
And it's clear to me, Mr. President, that our five business districts right now need revitalization.

977
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,441
They're struggling.

978
01:26:12,662 --> 01:26:14,404
We need new businesses to attract

979
01:26:15,024 --> 01:26:17,106
people into downtown business districts.

980
01:26:17,707 --> 01:26:32,339
And I don't think our Community Development Office has met that goal, Mr. President, and is in dire need of additional assistance in that office to move us forward on a project of this magnitude, Mr. President.

981
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:34,861
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

982
01:26:38,256 --> 01:26:57,539
On the motion by Councilman occurrence seconded by Also dollar also all those in favor aye motion passes 17 6 5 6 offered by councillor night resolved at the Memphis City Council congratulate all square cafe in the sauna the prior longtime method resident

983
01:26:58,273 --> 01:27:02,996
Michael Mosher on being named Boston A-List Best Breakfast.

984
01:27:03,096 --> 01:27:03,817
Counselor Knight.

985
01:27:04,217 --> 01:27:05,598
Mr. President, thank you very much.

986
01:27:05,918 --> 01:27:13,623
Although Ball Square Cafe is located right over the line over there on Boston Ave in Ball Square, Mike Mosher has been a longtime Method resident.

987
01:27:13,683 --> 01:27:16,125
I've known him for the majority of my life, Mr. President.

988
01:27:16,165 --> 01:27:16,725
I first met him.

989
01:27:17,664 --> 01:27:23,769
going into Victor's Deli in Ball Square that's owned and operated by his parents, Victor and Rosa, and his sister, Nancy, and her husband, Jason.

990
01:27:24,570 --> 01:27:29,934
Michael left Victor's and moved on to the Ball Square Cafe, where he opened up his own breakfast spot.

991
01:27:30,154 --> 01:27:33,617
And let me tell you, it's quite a place to go for breakfast, Mr. President.

992
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:35,478
But more so, Mike's a great guy.

993
01:27:36,179 --> 01:27:39,621
He puts out a great product, and he's an integral member of this community here in Medford.

994
01:27:39,641 --> 01:27:40,602
He does a lot to give back.

995
01:27:40,802 --> 01:27:46,647
So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to join me in congratulating Ball Square Cafe and its owner,

996
01:27:46,967 --> 01:27:52,169
Michael Mosher a long time graduate on the success of the organization.

997
01:27:52,549 --> 01:27:53,310
Counselor DelaRusso.

998
01:27:53,770 --> 01:28:07,096
Mr. President, I can personally attest that last week I had the French toast with ala bread, extra crispy bacon, and I had the fancy maple syrup that's real maple syrup.

999
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:10,051
Comes in a little glass jar.

1000
01:28:10,291 --> 01:28:11,473
Very, very good breakfast.

1001
01:28:12,333 --> 01:28:13,334
I'm hungry.

1002
01:28:13,434 --> 01:28:15,676
On the motion by Councilor Layton.

1003
01:28:15,837 --> 01:28:16,277
Seconded.

1004
01:28:16,317 --> 01:28:17,979
Seconded by Councilor Leono-Curran.

1005
01:28:17,999 --> 01:28:18,619
All those in favor?

1006
01:28:18,799 --> 01:28:19,200
Aye.

1007
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:22,283
Motion passes.

1008
01:28:22,623 --> 01:28:34,053
17657 offered by Councilor Leono-Curran be it resolved that the city administration appoint a development committee made up of interested residents who are willing to give up their time to help everyone understand, to better understand

1009
01:28:34,849 --> 01:28:39,730
the wants, needs, and recommendations of the community as it relates to development throughout Medford.

1010
01:28:40,191 --> 01:28:41,231
Councilor Locarno.

1011
01:28:41,811 --> 01:28:44,072
Thank you, President Carviello.

1012
01:28:44,432 --> 01:28:52,894
I think this is something that, this issue of the development is something that everybody seems to be talking about.

1013
01:28:53,054 --> 01:29:02,017
So many people have different opinions where development should go, how much, how little, not go certain places, more here, more there.

1014
01:29:03,177 --> 01:29:12,444
And we don't really have a committee made up of residents to discuss the issues and to get the feedback from the entire community.

1015
01:29:12,484 --> 01:29:20,090
And I think that's almost necessary, whether it be one committee or it be task force for each specific area.

1016
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:24,353
It was requested that there also be

1017
01:29:24,796 --> 01:29:38,374
which I'm going to amend the paper, there'd be a Mystic Ave Task Force made up of residents who want to see development in Mystic Ave and want to have input and voice their concerns and ask questions and be able to

1018
01:29:40,136 --> 01:29:43,220
figure out what the community wants down there.

1019
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:44,261
And I think that's important.

1020
01:29:44,281 --> 01:29:52,710
I think that's something that's been lacking with regards to some of the projects that have moved forward over the last several years, no community input.

1021
01:29:52,850 --> 01:29:56,815
It goes on the Zoning Board of Appeals agenda and gets approved.

1022
01:29:57,593 --> 01:30:05,702
I think Canal Street is the only one that I know that did not get approved, but we need more community input and I think this is the way to do it.

1023
01:30:05,722 --> 01:30:09,686
I think the committee, hopefully the mayor would be willing to set up a

1024
01:30:11,463 --> 01:30:32,632
a task force or a development committee made up of Medford residents from all different areas, and I'd like to amend the paper to ask that a Mystic Ave task force be put in place made up of South Medford residents and business owners who work on Mystic Ave, because that's coming down the line, and we wanna make sure we're prepared for it.

1025
01:30:32,712 --> 01:30:39,674
So I think this is something that's long overdue, and I believe the council, whether we have a council rep on the committee,

1026
01:30:41,255 --> 01:30:47,340
If this isn't moved forward, I think it's best to be organized by the administration.

1027
01:30:47,460 --> 01:31:02,533
If it's not moved forward by the administration, then I think the council has to create a committee within our own body to be able to discuss development in subcommittee and get the community involved as much as we can and get input.

1028
01:31:03,214 --> 01:31:07,978
It's hard when you're trying to see everything that's being written everywhere and try to get

1029
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:19,567
You know, try to form your opinions on where development should go and how much of it, when you don't have sit-down meetings to discuss it, I think that's what's missing.

1030
01:31:20,528 --> 01:31:30,815
For me, as one counselor, I'm not against development, but if a neighborhood like near the mall didn't want 500 units, you know, our votes and our,

1031
01:31:31,867 --> 01:31:49,356
Requests and our concerns stem from what the neighborhoods want and things are moving so quickly I think we need to be on top of it and a development committee To discuss development in general and then also different task force one specifically for mystic av is what we need.

1032
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:49,396
I

1033
01:31:51,233 --> 01:31:51,813
Oh, Scott Belly.

1034
01:31:52,313 --> 01:31:53,313
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

1035
01:31:53,393 --> 01:31:57,454
I thank my colleague, um, for bringing this motion forward.

1036
01:31:57,474 --> 01:32:06,196
I think, um, I think the mayor has done a very good job of getting, uh, constituents involved with different task force.

1037
01:32:06,276 --> 01:32:11,877
I can attest to that with the recreation committee that worked so hard to see that through fruition.

1038
01:32:11,897 --> 01:32:19,299
And I think that, uh, with so many questions and issues we have with development and so many educated, um,

1039
01:32:21,146 --> 01:32:34,593
people in our community that if you went to the development hearing and you listened about the revitalization of Meffitt Square and the ideas from the different constituents, I think that would be a welcome attribute that

1040
01:32:36,814 --> 01:32:39,056
that we should be using here in our community.

1041
01:32:39,096 --> 01:32:44,299
So I think that I would second my fellow councilor's resolution.

1042
01:32:44,399 --> 01:33:02,311
And I would hope the mayor's office will support that for the fact that a lot of the great things that are happening have come about with different task forces and committees that she started back in her beginning of her term.

1043
01:33:02,371 --> 01:33:04,392
So I thank you for bringing that up.

1044
01:33:05,633 --> 01:33:06,253
Councilor Falco.

1045
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:07,214
Thank you, Mr. President.

1046
01:33:07,294 --> 01:33:09,735
I thank the Council for bringing this resolution forward.

1047
01:33:09,775 --> 01:33:24,043
It's a resolution that I support and I do believe that there are many qualified professional people, you know, with professional backgrounds in different, you know, in development and traffic engineering and whatnot throughout our community that can really help out.

1048
01:33:24,583 --> 01:33:26,564
with regard to the future development in our city.

1049
01:33:27,085 --> 01:33:33,329
And who knows better than the people that actually live in that neighborhood on a daily basis what works and what doesn't work.

1050
01:33:33,749 --> 01:33:37,932
So I think it's always important to reach out to the neighborhoods and get their input.

1051
01:33:37,972 --> 01:33:39,433
And I think this is a great way of doing it.

1052
01:33:39,653 --> 01:33:41,914
So this is a resolution that I do support.

1053
01:33:42,275 --> 01:33:43,856
I think having people,

1054
01:33:44,616 --> 01:33:54,321
You know in the neighborhoods that are active that want to be involved that want to help shape the future of their community is important and the input Should definitely be heard so I support the resolution as well.

1055
01:33:54,441 --> 01:34:07,967
Thank you Thank you on the motion by council occurrence seconded by council Scott Pelley all of the favor aye motion passes 17 6 5 8 offers by vice president mocks be it resolved that the pothole located on

1056
01:34:08,327 --> 01:34:13,589
within the crosswalk at the McGlynn School main entrance be filled in the interest of public safety.

1057
01:34:13,929 --> 01:34:14,809
Vice President Mox.

1058
01:34:15,549 --> 01:34:16,790
Thank you, Mr. President.

1059
01:34:16,810 --> 01:34:31,114
This was brought to my attention by a concerned resident that was dropping off a child and said there's been a pothole right in the middle of the crosswalk to the McGlynn School entrance and that it's a rather deep pothole that needs to be filled.

1060
01:34:31,154 --> 01:34:35,436
So I would ask that this be filled in the interest of public safety immediately.

1061
01:34:35,936 --> 01:34:37,017
Thank you.

1062
01:34:37,277 --> 01:34:40,220
On the motion by Vice President Monk, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1063
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:41,261
All those in favor?

1064
01:34:41,441 --> 01:34:41,741
Aye.

1065
01:34:41,881 --> 01:34:44,363
Motion passes.

1066
01:34:44,383 --> 01:34:44,403
17-659.

1067
01:34:44,864 --> 01:34:45,324
Progress.

1068
01:34:45,784 --> 01:34:57,554
Offered by Councilor Longo-Kern, be it resolved that the Department of Public Works place a graphic on South Street at the intersection of Walnut to help warn the vehicles that there is a crosswalk.

1069
01:34:57,875 --> 01:34:58,855
Councilor Longo-Kern.

1070
01:34:59,136 --> 01:35:00,777
Thank you, President Carviello.

1071
01:35:02,585 --> 01:35:15,289
one of my several attempts for traffic calming on South Street because there are a number of residents that are working together to try to curb the speeding and obviously the heavy trucking that is speeding.

1072
01:35:16,369 --> 01:35:22,611
There's been stop signs that have been put up, crosswalk signs that have been put up and a number of different things.

1073
01:35:22,771 --> 01:35:26,812
The speed monitor sign, the new one that we have, there's one placed on South Street.

1074
01:35:26,832 --> 01:35:29,953
There's also one placed on Lawrence Road, which is great to see.

1075
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:33,207
If you go over the speed limit, they start flashing.

1076
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:35,211
It's a little.

1077
01:35:35,732 --> 01:35:35,972
Yes.

1078
01:35:36,132 --> 01:35:44,065
So, I mean, what we're doing here and getting the speed monitor signs and working, Sergeant Hartnett has been great, to get

1079
01:35:45,177 --> 01:35:48,098
some, you know, the speed reduced on some of our streets.

1080
01:35:48,279 --> 01:35:58,564
South Street, when I went to the Traffic Commission meeting a couple weeks ago, this was brought up, requested, and it was something that I believe the Chief of Police was on board with.

1081
01:35:58,704 --> 01:36:01,085
It's just a matter of getting the Department of Public Works to put

1082
01:36:01,585 --> 01:36:10,491
down a big graphic, the graphic that shows that there's a crosswalk coming up ahead, which it's only a few feet before the crosswalk, but it's just a little extra.

1083
01:36:10,872 --> 01:36:20,979
There are hundreds of people, like I said, I think a couple weeks ago, that cross South to Walnut because it's the gateway to the square leading into Colleen's ice cream shop.

1084
01:36:21,319 --> 01:36:24,021
when you cross that bridge right into the heart of Memphis Square.

1085
01:36:24,721 --> 01:36:29,565
So if we could get a graphic put on by the DPW, it would be greatly appreciated.

1086
01:36:29,605 --> 01:36:36,970
I think it's one of the many measures that are going on on South Street to help with the speeding and to help pedestrian safety.

1087
01:36:37,643 --> 01:36:37,863
Thank you.

1088
01:36:38,143 --> 01:36:39,024
Councilor Del Rosso.

1089
01:36:39,164 --> 01:36:41,826
Mr. President, I agree with this measure.

1090
01:36:42,307 --> 01:36:57,019
I, however, believe that that is the new standard for any repairs that are done on the streets and where that intersection is being corner of Winthrop and South Street is being renovated at this time.

1091
01:36:57,499 --> 01:37:02,924
I believe that any significant renovations must end with the cross scoring.

1092
01:37:03,624 --> 01:37:17,088
that's applied into the street as well as the new style of access ramps on the sidewalks with the hobnails in the ramp on the pad and other measures the like.

1093
01:37:17,668 --> 01:37:27,771
We can see this demonstrated most clearly with the work that's been done at the intersections of College Avenue and Boston Avenue.

1094
01:37:28,651 --> 01:37:31,732
So I agree with this and second approval.

1095
01:37:32,643 --> 01:37:33,323
On the motion.

1096
01:37:35,584 --> 01:37:38,225
Yes, just I think I think he was talking about Winthrop himself.

1097
01:37:38,285 --> 01:37:41,046
And this is with regards to Walnut, not Walnut himself.

1098
01:37:41,066 --> 01:37:45,487
There's no construction until ever source in this part of that street.

1099
01:37:45,567 --> 01:37:48,008
So I just want to make sure that was Yes, that was clear.

1100
01:37:48,308 --> 01:37:49,208
Mr. President.

1101
01:37:49,408 --> 01:37:53,130
Also, Vice President box, I too would like to just thank DPW.

1102
01:37:53,190 --> 01:38:00,472
Over the last several weeks, they have erected 42 speed limit signs now.

1103
01:38:01,012 --> 01:38:07,818
With the vote of this council, we have reduced the speed on many of our thoroughfares from 30 to 25 miles an hour.

1104
01:38:08,278 --> 01:38:11,260
And indeed, those signs are being posted throughout the community.

1105
01:38:11,701 --> 01:38:15,624
And I just want to thank DPW and the Traffic Commission for their efforts.

1106
01:38:16,425 --> 01:38:17,445
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1107
01:38:17,966 --> 01:38:21,349
On the motion by Councilor Locario and seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

1108
01:38:21,369 --> 01:38:22,650
All those in favor?

1109
01:38:22,670 --> 01:38:23,230
Aye.

1110
01:38:23,390 --> 01:38:24,511
Motion passes.

1111
01:38:26,573 --> 01:38:30,534
17-660 offered by Vice President Mox.

1112
01:38:31,474 --> 01:38:36,955
Be it ordered that- Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have a brief synopsis by the city clerk.

1113
01:38:37,935 --> 01:38:41,596
Mr. City Clerk, if you could please give a brief synopsis.

1114
01:38:51,237 --> 01:38:53,678
Following is a warrant for the election.

1115
01:38:54,238 --> 01:38:55,138
The election will be

1116
01:38:56,938 --> 01:39:02,902
On Tuesday, November 7th, polls will be open at 7 a.m., close at 8 p.m.

1117
01:39:05,184 --> 01:39:15,030
Races that will be on the ballot this year will be the mayor, city council, and the school committee.

1118
01:39:15,110 --> 01:39:18,713
We have a listing of polling locations.

1119
01:39:19,113 --> 01:39:21,474
These will be the polling locations

1120
01:39:23,768 --> 01:39:27,509
but only it would be similar to the last November's.

1121
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:46,153
And if I would like to also note that even though it's not on here, it's the last day to register a vote is Wednesday by 8 PM on October 18th.

1122
01:39:47,333 --> 01:39:48,033
Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

1123
01:39:49,482 --> 01:39:53,944
On the motion by Councilor, by Vice President Mach, seconded by.

1124
01:39:53,964 --> 01:39:55,284
Second.

1125
01:39:55,304 --> 01:39:56,205
Councilor Longo Kern.

1126
01:39:56,265 --> 01:39:58,526
Mr. President, would you like to amend the paper?

1127
01:39:59,426 --> 01:40:00,847
Councilor Layton, would you like to amend the paper?

1128
01:40:00,867 --> 01:40:11,371
To request that our Elections Commission review all the polling locations and do an analysis of feasibility to see if there are better and more local options for residents that live in certain wards.

1129
01:40:13,992 --> 01:40:14,392
Mr. Clerk.

1130
01:40:16,113 --> 01:40:24,681
On the motion by Vice President Mox seconded by Councilor Lungo-Kern.

1131
01:40:24,701 --> 01:40:27,544
All those in favor?

1132
01:40:27,584 --> 01:40:27,644
Aye.

1133
01:40:27,684 --> 01:40:28,965
Motion passes.

1134
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:44,403
17-662 I'll invite Vice President Mox be a resolve to the crosswalks on Highland Avenue.

1135
01:40:44,843 --> 01:40:46,745
Be painted in the interest of public safety.

1136
01:40:47,285 --> 01:40:48,406
Vice President Mox.

1137
01:40:48,987 --> 01:40:50,248
Thank you Mr. President.

1138
01:40:50,748 --> 01:40:55,572
I know DPW is diligently working on the painting of many of our crosswalks.

1139
01:40:56,132 --> 01:41:10,379
However, Highland Ave, I know, is a state road, and I would ask that our DPW reach out to the state to get the state on top of painting the crosswalks, Mr. President, in the interest of public safety.

1140
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:21,745
Also, Mr. President, if I could, I had the opportunity this past Saturday, there was a young gentleman in our community who was going for his Eagle Scout badge.

1141
01:41:22,205 --> 01:41:42,772
His name is John Fee, and the project he selected, which I thought was a pretty unique project to assist this community, was to erect 100 hydrant markers to alert the fire department and also residents in a time when snow gets heavy where fire hydrants are located.

1142
01:41:43,612 --> 01:41:47,415
And John Fee reached out to the vocational school.

1143
01:41:48,356 --> 01:41:53,299
The vocational students bent up the wrought iron, cut it for John.

1144
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:55,881
John and his scouts painted them.

1145
01:41:56,402 --> 01:42:06,509
And this past Saturday, with the thanks of Mr. Tanaglia in DPW and Mr. Kruger in the water department, they went out and erected 100 of these.

1146
01:42:07,049 --> 01:42:11,693
And I can tell you, they're gonna last forever, these particular hydra markers.

1147
01:42:12,373 --> 01:42:17,897
And it's a great community project and something that I know I've spoken about a number of times.

1148
01:42:18,677 --> 01:42:28,863
And it's great to see someone in the community step forward and make such a positive change on behalf of the residents, Mr. President.

1149
01:42:29,063 --> 01:42:30,024
Thank you, Mr. President.

1150
01:42:30,204 --> 01:42:35,407
If I can amend that, if we can invite him here to receive a citation in the near future.

1151
01:42:36,407 --> 01:42:42,750
As soon as he gets his Eagle Skull badge, this was a step in the process, he will be invited and I appreciate that.

1152
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:43,110
Thank you.

1153
01:42:43,590 --> 01:42:46,171
On the motion by Vice President Mox.

1154
01:42:46,431 --> 01:42:46,732
Second.

1155
01:42:47,052 --> 01:42:48,292
Seconded by Councilor Inouye.

1156
01:42:48,352 --> 01:42:49,113
All those in favor?

1157
01:42:49,353 --> 01:42:49,673
Aye.

1158
01:42:49,873 --> 01:42:50,713
Motion passes.

1159
01:42:51,213 --> 01:42:53,815
Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

1160
01:42:55,315 --> 01:42:55,975
All those in favor?

1161
01:42:56,216 --> 01:42:56,376
Aye.

1162
01:42:56,596 --> 01:42:56,996
Aye.

1163
01:42:57,856 --> 01:42:59,197
Offered by Councilor Falco.

1164
01:43:00,351 --> 01:43:09,814
Whereas the Memphis Farmer's Market takes place at the Carleton Shell on the banks of the Mississippi River, whereas the Farmer's Market is from 3 to 7 PM on Thursday afternoon.

1165
01:43:10,215 --> 01:43:19,478
We have resolved that the Mayor's Office or Electrical Department have the lights at the Carleton Shell activated in the interest of public safety.

1166
01:43:20,661 --> 01:43:21,441
Councilor Falco.

1167
01:43:21,561 --> 01:43:22,621
Thank you, Mr. President.

1168
01:43:22,742 --> 01:43:29,243
I had the opportunity this weekend to go along with a lot of my colleagues to go to the Mystic River celebration.

1169
01:43:30,063 --> 01:43:37,325
And while I was there, I was going to some of the different tables and, you know, just, you know, getting more information, talking to people and whatnot.

1170
01:43:37,565 --> 01:43:44,167
And they went to the Method Farmers Market table and just asked them because I think this is their first year in a new location down at the Condon Shell.

1171
01:43:44,687 --> 01:43:46,687
And they said so far it's been really, really good.

1172
01:43:46,707 --> 01:43:50,128
They've had a lot of great activity, a lot of people walking down on Thursday afternoons to

1173
01:43:51,009 --> 01:43:56,896
just buy some local produce and whatnot, and just ask them a little bit about the new location.

1174
01:43:57,256 --> 01:43:58,838
And they said it's great.

1175
01:43:58,959 --> 01:44:06,108
They said the challenge now is it's towards the end of the season, so the sun goes down a little bit sooner, and the market goes until 7 PM.

1176
01:44:08,170 --> 01:44:33,316
that last hour it gets a little it's it's getting dark basically and um you know so that you know it's it's tough for people to walk around and it's also tough for the vendors to clean up after you know the market closes down um so you know in the matter of public in the you know matter of public safety it'd be nice if we could uh at the mayor's office of the electric department um see what they can do to uh have the lights activated uh for at least the last hour uh of the um

1177
01:44:33,836 --> 01:44:42,567
Farmers market at Thursday afternoon said so it'd probably be it'd be nice if they could activate him from pray anytime after 5 to at least I'm guessing maybe 7 30 p.m.

1178
01:44:43,068 --> 01:44:45,090
Just just you know, so it's it's safe down there.

1179
01:44:45,170 --> 01:44:52,379
It should be well lit and it's a great venue to have really any type of You know

1180
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:54,320
local city function.

1181
01:44:54,760 --> 01:45:00,622
So it's in the matter of public safety, if we could have for that to the mayor's office of the electrical department, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1182
01:45:00,802 --> 01:45:00,922

1188
01:45:15,506 --> 01:45:17,807
Councilor Langau-Kern, how have you found those records?

1189
01:45:17,867 --> 01:45:21,668
I've reviewed them a second time and I want to move approval.

Motion to accept the records of August 15, 2017, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1191
01:45:31,128 --> 01:45:31,808

Councilor Scarpelli, how did you find those records?

1195
01:45:41,037 --> 01:45:46,662
If I could take these for a week to look in further depth, I'd appreciate it.

1196
01:45:48,163 --> 01:45:50,504
All in favor?

1197
01:45:50,544 --> 01:45:51,825

Vice President Mox.

1201
01:45:58,429 --> 01:46:09,475
Before we adjourn, if you can just get this body estimated time when we will be back in the Alderman Chambers for our regularly scheduled meetings, I think that would be helpful.

1202
01:46:10,095 --> 01:46:13,658
I was there, I've looked, it looks like it's

1203
01:46:15,415 --> 01:46:19,818
It's close, I would think maybe next week, hopefully will be the last week that we'll be here.

1204
01:46:20,498 --> 01:46:29,484
But if we can get a more definite- I will try my hardest to, I've tried to get an answer from the people working in there, and I couldn't get a definitive answer from them.

1205
01:46:29,825 --> 01:46:32,246
Maybe the administration- I will talk to the administration.

1206
01:46:32,306 --> 01:46:32,907
If I may.

1207
01:46:35,589 --> 01:46:47,096
A couple residents complained about the meeting last week in the theater and how the, I guess it looked on TV.

1208
01:46:48,137 --> 01:46:55,022
So I did reach out to Lauren Felch from the mayor's office and she did say the beginning of October we should be back in the chamber.

1209
01:46:57,657 --> 01:46:58,758
Nobody's complaining more than us.

1210
01:47:00,219 --> 01:47:00,839
I love the lights.
