1
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:43,973
you

2
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,990
Thank you, Chair Lozaro.

3
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:24,355
I think we'll probably end up talking about both of them in concert, but I can run through the overgrowth ordinance draft quickly and then the rodent control updates quickly and then we can talk about the kind of global issues that we need to get both of these over the finish line.

4
00:13:25,815 --> 00:13:25,975
Great.

5
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:26,922
Thank you.

6
00:13:28,623 --> 00:13:35,127
Thank you, my fellow counselors for your collaboration on these two ordinances.

7
00:13:35,227 --> 00:13:38,509
Again, one of them is new, one of them we're just updating an existing ordinance on the books.

8
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:44,013
Thank you to Director O'Connor for proposing these updates and for your collaboration on this.

9
00:13:45,294 --> 00:13:49,076
I believe the last time we met on these ordinances was just a month or two ago.

10
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,303
In broad strokes, just to get us all on the same page, the overgrowth ordinance is new.

11
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:05,168
One of the reasons that we are creating an overgrowth ordinance is so that, well, it's to respond to problems.

12
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:16,016
One of the problems with overgrowth is that occasionally when property owners don't take care of their property, overgrowth causes impediments on the public way, which is not fair to people who use the public way.

13
00:14:16,596 --> 00:14:22,220
And the Board of Health needs something on the books that allows them to take enforcement action when that is occurring.

14
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,862
Again, it's rare, but when it does happen, the city needs to be able to step in.

15
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:29,104
So the ordinance, this ordinance would create that possibility.

16
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:35,689
Secondly, the Board of Health director has been taking steps to shore up the city's responsiveness to our

17
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:42,370
rampant rodent issues in the city, which are, you know, I'd say, no better or worse than anywhere else in the region.

18
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:55,073
But being able to strengthen our holistic systemic approach to rodent control is a big part of keeping rats away from every part of the city, whether there are burrows on your street or not.

19
00:14:55,953 --> 00:15:04,255
The city needs to have more tools to help property owners prevent rodents on their property and take enforcement action when people are not being responsible about it.

20
00:15:05,397 --> 00:15:07,521
So the rodent control ordinance already exists.

21
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:15,238
We want to add some language that would give the Board of Health more ability to step in and take enforcement action when necessary.

22
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:41,430
And we are also looking for ways to direct more of the fees and fines associated with both the overgrowth ordinance and the rodent control ordinance into the rodent control revolving accounts that the city has more funding available to do its rodent mitigation work which as we all know, we, every single neighborhood of the city really needs, and the city needs more resources to be able to do that.

23
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:51,077
So it's appropriate that fees and fines collected associated with violations of the Overgrowth Ordinance and the Rodent Control Ordinance should go into that fund.

24
00:15:52,838 --> 00:16:00,563
So since last time, I have updated the drafts to include more comments from Director O'Connor to kind of bring us to where we are in this meeting.

25
00:16:00,663 --> 00:16:05,907
And we have also had a preliminary review of the draft ordinances by City Solicitor Kevin Foley.

26
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:10,530
Because of when he joined City Hall, this was the first time that he's had the opportunity to review these drafts.

27
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:17,878
So I will quickly I think counselors got them got these drafts in their packets last week.

28
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:31,332
But maybe I will just walk through the two ordinances, very very quickly and then I will move over to solicitor Foley's red line and just try to summarize his main comments on the ordinances so far.

29
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:37,950
can synthesize our next steps to get these finished.

30
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,771
So actually, I want to interrupt myself.

31
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:46,456
And before I dive in, Director O'Connor, if there's anything that you'd like to say as introduction or to introduce these projects, by all means.

32
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:53,482
Oh, sorry, we should have you mic'd.

33
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:00,431
Thank you, Councilman Coates, for all your work on this and for helping push this forward.

34
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:12,693
We really do feel this is very important to help us continue our mitigation efforts and also to address some of the violations in a more meaningful and better enforcement.

35
00:17:12,853 --> 00:17:18,734
So appreciate you all taking this under consideration and happy to answer any questions at the end.

36
00:17:20,535 --> 00:17:22,015
Great, thank you so much, Director O'Connor.

37
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:31,849
Okay.

38
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:34,853
Great, thank you.

39
00:17:34,993 --> 00:17:36,696
I will share my screen.

40
00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:49,131
So I will quickly share the non-redlined version and then I'll move over to Solicitor Foley's redlined version.

41
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:53,467
He sent these over in advance of this meeting.

42
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:55,328
Unfortunately, he wasn't able to be with us tonight.

43
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,849
This is just to get everybody up to speed.

44
00:17:57,889 --> 00:18:01,591
These are also linked on the city council's public portal if anybody wants to follow along.

45
00:18:01,611 --> 00:18:05,053
This is really short purpose and intent.

46
00:18:05,273 --> 00:18:06,093
I just spoke to that.

47
00:18:06,914 --> 00:18:15,418
In this initial draft, we were looking to see if the solicitor had feedback on if any of these kind of overgrowth specific terms should be defined for clarity within the ordinance.

48
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:19,881
And then we get to the real substance of the ordinance.

49
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:33,024
referring to prohibited and required actions in the case of overgrowth and harborage conditions, that being rodent harborage, so when stuff is going on a private property that is causing plant overgrowth or rodent harborage.

50
00:18:35,045 --> 00:18:42,627
Essentially saying that any property owner whose property abutting a sidewalk or public right-of-way shall not allow shall not allow overgrowth

51
00:18:43,928 --> 00:18:53,294
To remain to such an degree that an impediment occurs that it blocks the right of way, it must be remained free of vegetation that is infested with rodents or other dangerous insects or animals.

52
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:59,298
Property must be maintained free of pools of stagnant water that are conducive to the breeding of mosquitoes.

53
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:08,763
or that create a fire hazard and property must be maintained free of an overgrowth of ragweed or other known widely allergenic plants.

54
00:19:09,323 --> 00:19:12,045
This was created with the collaboration of the Board of Health.

55
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:21,450
Again, the point of this is not to say what people can grow in their gardens, but rather to say that people cannot create or maintain public health hazards on their property.

56
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,032
Enforcement and penalties.

57
00:19:25,092 --> 00:19:26,593
First offense, written warning.

58
00:19:26,693 --> 00:19:30,896
I think it's, you know, it's never the Board of Health's intent to immediately fine people.

59
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:39,143
The intent is to resolve the issue and that's reflected in the first offense being met with a letter of warning and a request to correct the issue.

60
00:19:39,643 --> 00:19:40,844
Second offense, $50.

61
00:19:41,124 --> 00:19:42,625
Third and each subsequent offense, $100.

62
00:19:44,186 --> 00:20:02,808
penalty fines collected from the enforcement of this ordinance shall be deposited into the rodent control account, which already exists, and I believe that some fees are already going into that account because of the integrated pest management plans that companies that have dumpsters have to feed into.

63
00:20:04,918 --> 00:20:08,239
So the solicitors, let me switch what screen I'm sharing.

64
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:18,381
The solicitor's feedback on this draft looks crazy, but most of it is just language tweaks, which is fine.

65
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:19,901
He's the legal writer, not myself.

66
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,122
He suggests that we renumber the ordinance.

67
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,322
I'm just going to try to quickly summarize this red line.

68
00:20:27,423 --> 00:20:31,924
And I believe it was circulated to counselors via the interim clerk on Monday as well.

69
00:20:32,484 --> 00:20:33,924
Suggest renumbering the ordinance,

70
00:20:37,478 --> 00:20:40,066
and putting it into a different section within our municipal code.

71
00:20:44,948 --> 00:20:50,251
The solicitor suggests, I believe, no definitions, feeling that those are unnecessary.

72
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:53,673
I'll certainly defer to legal opinion on that.

73
00:20:55,094 --> 00:21:00,798
Unnecessary to include a deferential reference to the Department of Conservation and Recreation, which makes sense.

74
00:21:00,818 --> 00:21:04,260
That does go without saying that all local ordinances are preempted by state law.

75
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:09,343
There is some wordsmithing on the, you know,

76
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:17,664
kind of the heart of this ordinance that talks about what property owners may or may not do or must do to correct overgrowth that's affecting public way.

77
00:21:21,485 --> 00:21:29,546
And the solicitor also recommends that we not include language regarding an overgrowth of ragweed or other allergenic plants.

78
00:21:29,566 --> 00:21:38,528
I'm just looking for, sorry, there's a lot of comments here and I'm trying to find the one that explains his

79
00:21:40,762 --> 00:21:41,342
understanding.

80
00:21:43,164 --> 00:21:57,773
He writes, as a practical matter, property owners cannot be expected to, pardon me, calling into question whether the city can legally enforce a prohibition on certain types of plants growing on public property.

81
00:21:57,793 --> 00:22:01,315
And with this, I think he's saying it is impractical either

82
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:09,479
not possible or impractical for the city to prohibit property owners from ragweed growing on their properties.

83
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:23,247
Because the solicitor isn't here and there's a lot of comments on both of these ordinances, this is something that I'd like for us to discuss further before we finalize this ordinance, because I think broadly, with all of these ordinances and a lot of ordinances,

84
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:32,010
It's not really that we want to be able to find anybody if there's ever ragweed growing on their property ever.

85
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:32,691
That's not the point.

86
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:36,574
That's never how the Board of Health is going to be spending their time running down where ragweed occurs.

87
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:38,595
It's just that the city needs to be able to intervene.

88
00:22:39,236 --> 00:22:45,020
If there's an overgrowth to such an extent that it's really causing problems, we need something on the books that they can then intervene.

89
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,521
to that end.

90
00:22:50,323 --> 00:22:57,938
I'm not really clear on why it's problematic to have that language in there, knowing that this is never going to be enforced unless it actually creates a public health hazard.

91
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:51,967
Yeah, I don't think you're amplifying.

92
00:23:56,549 --> 00:23:59,129
No, but it's like, Jesus Christ.

93
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:00,170
Sorry.

94
00:24:02,095 --> 00:24:03,516
Is who's in the room?

95
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:05,037
How does this sound?

96
00:24:05,097 --> 00:24:06,679
Okay, it now sounds really loud.

97
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:10,862
Okay.

98
00:24:11,903 --> 00:24:24,072
Um, what I was saying before is, it's probably a language thing, but that we could finagle it, but it, it kind of reminds me of

99
00:24:25,027 --> 00:24:35,657
legal language issues around, you know it when you see it, that if it was so much ragweed that it's causing a problem for neighbors, then it would be a problem.

100
00:24:36,238 --> 00:24:41,223
And it would be beneficial to have solicitor fully here to address the issues.

101
00:24:41,843 --> 00:24:44,606
Councilor Callahan, then I'll go back to Vice President Collins.

102
00:24:44,926 --> 00:24:46,868
Sorry, Councilor Callahan, what number is your mic?

103
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:47,449
Six.

104
00:24:49,847 --> 00:25:00,476
Yeah, just a super quick, would it help to remove the specific ones and just say all property must be maintained free of an overgrowth of widely allergic plants?

105
00:25:00,736 --> 00:25:02,297
Then we're not mentioning them by name?

106
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:09,043
I think what we're going to keep running into with this is that we're not going to be able to make any decisions until Solicitor Foley is here.

107
00:25:09,063 --> 00:25:11,845
Vice President Collins?

108
00:25:13,587 --> 00:25:21,586
Thank you yeah no I think these language suggestions are helpful because I think what I see in his comments is that some of these some of my language choices.

109
00:25:23,808 --> 00:25:27,490
seem to be, for this purpose, not quite it, which, again, is fine.

110
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,732
I'm not the one with the JD.

111
00:25:30,152 --> 00:25:40,158
But I think, and I'd be curious to hear Director O'Connor's perspective on this as well, I think it would be good to see how much of this content can we keep as long as we change the language to be what it needs to be.

112
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:47,922
Certainly, it seems like the language, all property must be maintained free of, is perhaps too comprehensive.

113
00:25:48,823 --> 00:25:49,283
That's fine.

114
00:25:52,237 --> 00:26:03,441
I think I'm certain that there's other language that still gives Board of Health latitude to intervene when things are, for example, allowed to proliferate to the extent that a public health hazard is observed.

115
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,622
Yes.

116
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,363
Per the complaints of neighbors.

117
00:26:08,263 --> 00:26:15,926
All of it seems like the wholesale removal of the entire bullet point doesn't seem strictly necessary.

118
00:26:16,727 --> 00:26:17,667
Councilor Sang?

119
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:43,849
Yeah, I mean, I think in reading the comment, I think the worry is that it's overbroad and would punish people who kind of can't control circumstances or, for example, maybe a stagnant pool of water just forms one day and a code enforcement officer passes by and warns them or finds them.

120
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:57,501
but I do think maybe this is a less of a legal question, actually more of a question for city staff to be, to help us in defining the circumstances.

121
00:26:57,561 --> 00:26:59,282
So there's less gray area.

122
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:13,093
Cause I think the way I read it as the original language, if you could scroll back up, I think the way that I would have,

123
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:27,058
found difficult for a court, if this, for example, ever got litigated, what would make it difficult for a court to understand is where to draw the line between this is clearly not

124
00:27:28,475 --> 00:27:37,878
you know, intentional or negligent on the behalf of a property owner versus this is and where the draw the line.

125
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:50,023
I think maybe what would help with this wording is to work with city staff to find at least a bit of a clearer line of what is and what's not.

126
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:55,745
I don't necessarily read the comment from the solicitor to say

127
00:27:56,505 --> 00:27:58,986
that all of this is unenforceable.

128
00:27:59,046 --> 00:28:02,248
I think it's just as as is, it's a bit over broad.

129
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:15,215
So I think with that in mind, I think it's actually the people we should talk to first are actually maybe city staff with a better understanding of the issue and the trouble that we're trying to solve.

130
00:28:18,636 --> 00:28:19,137
Thank you.

131
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:21,638
Uh, Vice President Collins.

132
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:23,659
Yeah, thank you.

133
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:24,459
I think that's helpful.

134
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,240
And, um,

135
00:28:28,232 --> 00:28:46,336
I'd say if I'm going to follow up about this with going to follow up about all of this with Board of Health after this meeting, of course, like we're talking about before the meeting, but if for the purposes of our general edification if there's any sort of clarification that you'd like provide in this setting on sort of like what we're really going for here will be most helpful to your department.

136
00:28:46,756 --> 00:28:50,317
That is our whole goal with updating this ordinance so feel free to use this forum to.

137
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:56,378
shed a little bit more light on the situations in which it would be helpful for you to be able to intervene.

138
00:28:57,719 --> 00:29:02,460
And certainly, you know, I'll be reaching out to collect that information when we go back and update this draft as well.

139
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,840
So if you'd like to speak to that now, that's fine.

140
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,161
Or we can review more at our next meeting.

141
00:29:13,202 --> 00:29:15,103
Oh, sorry, could you turn the mic on?

142
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:16,503
Oh, sorry.

143
00:29:18,763 --> 00:29:23,726
I apologize because I have not seen the red line version, so I haven't really had a chance to go through it.

144
00:29:23,766 --> 00:29:27,407
But my understanding, like, the overgrowth to me is the key, right?

145
00:29:27,427 --> 00:29:31,389
We're not punishing anyone for having, you know, a little bit of ragweed on their property.

146
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,431
It's overgrowth uncapped.

147
00:29:35,852 --> 00:29:38,673
Not that it's intentional, but that it's there.

148
00:29:40,074 --> 00:29:41,595
And, you know, pools of stagnant water.

149
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,771
That are conducive to the breeding of mosquitoes.

150
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:58,875
So, you know, after if you have a puddle on your property after a rainstorm that's going to dry up that's not a pool of stagnant water that's not going to breed mosquitoes but if you have, you know, tires on your property or things you know open barrels or whatever.

151
00:29:59,475 --> 00:30:03,040
that water could sit there long enough and be stagnant.

152
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:09,748
We have people with pools that they no longer use, but they can maintain to have water in their pools.

153
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:17,578
And that is certainly a breeding ground for mosquitoes and causes problems for neighbors and we do have West Nile virus and

154
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:20,700
and other concerns with mosquitos.

155
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:38,487
So I would love to go over this with Councillor Collins and the city solicitor to really see, like again, I really haven't had a chance to look at his issues with some of the language, but happy to go over it with him.

156
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:45,769
I'm sorry, you're not.

157
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:46,770
Oh, sorry.

158
00:30:49,213 --> 00:30:49,433
Thanks.

159
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:52,378
I had a question about the ragweed portion.

160
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:59,689
I think your illustration of the stagnant water really helps us understand what we're trying to solve here.

161
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,595
Could you kind of give a similar illustration of the ragweed situation?

162
00:31:04,555 --> 00:31:26,296
certainly again yeah it would be an abundance and an overgrowth unmaintained unkept property that would be causing problems for neighbors children in the area whatever who may have you know allergies to those situations or asthma whatever so again it would be an overgrowth situation an extensive situation something that

163
00:31:27,117 --> 00:31:29,178
a neighbor would complain about, basically.

164
00:31:29,518 --> 00:31:32,299
And that's when most of the time how we find out about these issues.

165
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,861
It's not that we would be going out looking for them.

166
00:31:35,281 --> 00:31:40,303
It's most of the time neighbors themselves are complaining about their neighbor's properties because they are having issues.

167
00:31:40,943 --> 00:31:41,884
Thanks.

168
00:31:41,904 --> 00:31:44,245
Yeah, I think that helps.

169
00:31:44,565 --> 00:31:53,769
I think we're beginning to see, at least with the stagnant water situation, maybe a way that we could define the situation that's a little bit broader than just the creation of.

170
00:31:55,076 --> 00:32:13,589
Although that might actually capture what you're describing, but we could maybe put in something with regards to containers, vestibules, something of stagnant water, so that people know more clearly what we're referring to.

171
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,010
I don't know.

172
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,752
I don't have any specific suggestions right now.

173
00:32:18,408 --> 00:32:19,849
That's actually a good idea.

174
00:32:20,069 --> 00:32:22,931
But I think that that might help just make it clearer.

175
00:32:23,572 --> 00:32:31,998
And then if we can find this similar kind of like analogy wording for the ragweed situation, that might be helpful.

176
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:40,385
I think extensive might not be clear enough of a line, which is why I think we might need to just think about it for a little bit.

177
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,566
But yeah.

178
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:44,168
I don't know if problematic will be, I don't know.

179
00:32:44,188 --> 00:32:44,308
Yeah.

180
00:32:46,552 --> 00:32:53,372
I have two of our sanitarians are with us too, so if they have any suggestions or they're the ones out there doing this work every day, so.

181
00:33:01,598 --> 00:33:02,218
Hi, everyone.

182
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:03,478
I'm Raven.

183
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:07,679
I'm one of the sanitarians that works under Director O'Connor.

184
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:13,080
It might be helpful just like if we're looking for language to use specifically.

185
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,941
I don't know if anybody is familiar with the state sanitary code, the housing code.

186
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:22,242
It's 105 CMR 410.

187
00:33:22,842 --> 00:33:27,443
But it's the code that we use a lot of the times whenever we are dealing with property owners.

188
00:33:29,403 --> 00:33:42,168
There is a specific section in there that talks about stagnant water and things like that because it can be conducive for rodents because rodents need water and things like that.

189
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:55,733
So it may just be a good idea to maybe look at that if we're trying to condense it down and define it specifically because that's a legal document, this is a legal document, and it may just be helpful.

190
00:33:57,513 --> 00:33:58,093
Thank you so much.

191
00:33:58,134 --> 00:33:59,294
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

192
00:33:59,354 --> 00:33:59,794
Yeah.

193
00:34:01,274 --> 00:34:02,235
It's very helpful.

194
00:34:02,455 --> 00:34:02,915
Thank you.

195
00:34:02,935 --> 00:34:09,637
Um, do you need a an address for the senatorians for the record?

196
00:34:10,357 --> 00:34:11,217
Okay.

197
00:34:11,537 --> 00:34:11,857
Thank you.

198
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:18,339
Um, do you have any other questions for Raven or Vice President Collins?

199
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,080
Thank you.

200
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,961
I think that's really helpful.

201
00:34:23,741 --> 00:34:34,866
And as we continue to wordsmith this, I think we should just plan on being in collaboration to make sure that it as closely matches your needs in the language that you use as possible, because that's the whole point.

202
00:34:35,847 --> 00:34:36,327
Thank you.

203
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:36,967
Really helpful.

204
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:48,973
So just to tie a bow on the suggested edits to the overgrowth ordinance.

205
00:34:52,753 --> 00:34:53,814
Bear with me for one second.

206
00:34:59,476 --> 00:35:08,701
So the final major piece on this ordinance is our segue into the Road and Control Ordinance updates as well.

207
00:35:09,581 --> 00:35:15,064
One thing that the solicitor flagged that he wants to review further, including as per his suggestion with KP Law,

208
00:35:16,044 --> 00:35:29,908
is making sure that we have everything in place that we need, that penalty fines collected from this ordinance and also from the Road and Control Ordinance can be deposited into the Road and Control account.

209
00:35:32,249 --> 00:35:36,890
That is something that I think me and Director O'Connor are going to sync up with the solicitor about offline.

210
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:44,872
I think the solicitor described to me in a phone call yesterday that he has some concerns, he has some, sorry,

211
00:35:47,535 --> 00:36:00,598
concerns that while we have the language on the books that we need so that fees can go into revolving accounts, he is concerned that we don't have the language on the books that we need so that fines can go into revolving account.

212
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:16,262
This is something we have to run down, especially because per our, this is the tobacco regulation ordinance, fees and fines both associated with the tobacco regulation ordinance are already going into a revolving account for the tobacco regulation account.

213
00:36:18,203 --> 00:36:32,810
So what we need to get on the same page about with the solicitor is if we are all set to go with having fees and fines associated with these ordinances go into the rodent control account or if there is a step missing that we need to go back and fix so that

214
00:36:34,513 --> 00:36:44,144
You know if somebody refuses to do what is needed to prevent a large infestation of rats on their property and they get fined.

215
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:53,354
What do we need to do to make sure that that can go into the account where it belongs, so that the Board of Health has the money it needs to prevent rodent proliferation in the future.

216
00:36:55,214 --> 00:37:06,319
So the solicitor raised that concern with fines from the Orphan Growth Ordinance going into the Road and Control Account with this ordinance, and he raised the same concern with the Road and Control Ordinance as well.

217
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:16,684
Director O'Connor did, just before the meeting, direct me to... It's our current Medford Ordinance.

218
00:37:17,864 --> 00:37:21,046
This is Article 5, Division 4, Section 2,

219
00:37:24,137 --> 00:37:40,125
964, authorized revolving funds, and that does indeed list both fines and fees going into an existing revolving account for a different one, but I think the question is, are we good and we just need to get on the same page, or is there something that we need to fix holistically so that fines and fees can both go into revolving accounts when they occur?

220
00:37:41,921 --> 00:37:58,628
I know this is absolutely titillating stuff, but at the end of the day, we're trying to make sure that the city has the money that it needs from property owners who are delinquent willfully so that we can prevent rodent proliferation for everybody else who is following the rules and trying to do the right thing.

221
00:38:00,268 --> 00:38:08,992
And not to put too fine a point on it, but when we are asked if we are paying too close attention to national or international issues,

222
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:25,076
It is important to draw people's attention back to meetings like this that are very sparsely attended, but are still taking place and are about local issues such as rodent control and overgrowth of ragweed and standing water.

223
00:38:25,816 --> 00:38:28,778
I do have a raised hand from the DPW commissioner.

224
00:38:28,798 --> 00:38:32,520
Commissioner McIvern, I'm gonna ask you to unmute.

225
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:36,202
Hi, thank you.

226
00:38:36,222 --> 00:38:38,623
Go ahead.

227
00:38:40,306 --> 00:38:42,508
I just caught this on the agenda, I saw you guys talking about it.

228
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:46,632
I was just wondering if I could have a chance to review this ordinance.

229
00:38:46,732 --> 00:38:47,954
I saw a couple of things in it.

230
00:38:49,035 --> 00:39:00,807
It seems maybe we got to look at this to see if it's duplicating anything because DPW does public right of way enforcement for sidewalk obstructions already based off existing ordinance.

231
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:02,668
So I just saw that piece in there.

232
00:39:03,189 --> 00:39:08,873
And then as far as public way and enforcement, I know the building department doesn't do that, we do that.

233
00:39:09,034 --> 00:39:12,797
So the DBW does enforcement in the public right of way.

234
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:20,743
But I would love to have an opportunity to dive in a little deeper and provide some comments.

235
00:39:22,945 --> 00:39:24,787
Yeah, Vice President Collins.

236
00:39:26,621 --> 00:39:27,902
Yeah, thank you, Commissioner given.

237
00:39:27,922 --> 00:39:35,227
I just shared them with you on one drive, and I'd be happy to set up a meeting to get your thoughts on it before we, um Submit revised drafts to this committee as well.

238
00:39:36,327 --> 00:39:36,627
Awesome.

239
00:39:36,647 --> 00:39:36,968
Thank you.

240
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:54,119
My understanding also is that sometimes that these measures are taking place to mitigate some of these issues, but that there may not be, um, something in place if Something's proliferating to have teeth behind it.

241
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,900
There may not be, um

242
00:39:56,864 --> 00:40:02,206
anybody empowered to take action if it's not happening beyond a warning or something like that?

243
00:40:02,446 --> 00:40:04,067
I'm not sure if that's the case here, but.

244
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:15,151
So we have a process if vegetation is growing into the public way and it either is causing an obstruction or a site distance, site viewing issue, then we do write them letters.

245
00:40:15,431 --> 00:40:17,272
We provide enforcement.

246
00:40:17,892 --> 00:40:18,952
We can fine as well.

247
00:40:19,112 --> 00:40:19,973
We do do that as well.

248
00:40:21,113 --> 00:40:22,694
So we, you know,

249
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:33,790
I think, you know, in general, people forget that the DBW has a large actually enforcement piece, but it's, it's, you know, I have a part-time basically enforcement officer.

250
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,390
I'd love to have a full-time enforcement officer, but it's a different conversation.

251
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:42,772
But, you know, it's something that both me and the city engineer, as well as the deputy commissioner are always doing.

252
00:40:43,672 --> 00:40:45,353
is enforcing in the public right of way.

253
00:40:45,573 --> 00:40:48,615
And then the building department and everybody else is on private property.

254
00:40:49,315 --> 00:40:55,439
So that piece completely get, and I would agree that the ordinance that exists now is not very strong.

255
00:40:55,479 --> 00:40:59,241
It's very old when it comes to sidewalk obstructions and things like that.

256
00:40:59,301 --> 00:41:08,966
So I think it just needs to be, we need to look at existing ordinance and see what DPW is already enforcing and see what we're already doing and make sure this one is coordinated.

257
00:41:11,114 --> 00:41:11,735
Okay, sounds good.

258
00:41:11,755 --> 00:41:14,558
We wouldn't want to replicate efforts if it's not necessary to.

259
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:16,280
Thank you for mentioning that.

260
00:41:16,861 --> 00:41:17,441
Yeah, no problem.

261
00:41:17,461 --> 00:41:20,265
Thanks for putting something forward that I think needs to be addressed.

262
00:41:20,285 --> 00:41:20,745
This is great.

263
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:25,531
Councilor Collins.

264
00:41:26,363 --> 00:41:29,206
Great, thank you and want to thank you again Commissioner McGibbon.

265
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:44,562
Well, it will absolutely welcome your comments on this and certainly will want to make sure that especially when it comes down to who's responsible for what in terms of enforcement action that it's clear that the division of who's responsible for what is clear between.

266
00:41:45,082 --> 00:41:46,683
departments and also clear for residents.

267
00:41:47,443 --> 00:41:57,327
Um, so thanks again for, um, thank you for, for timing in on this meeting and look forward to, um, discussing your feedback on this draft as well.

268
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:58,827
I meant to turn on my camera.

269
00:41:58,847 --> 00:41:59,387
Sorry about that.

270
00:41:59,427 --> 00:42:02,708
I was, I was even testing it out, but anyway, I'm all set with you guys.

271
00:42:02,748 --> 00:42:04,429
Thank you very much and have a very nice night.

272
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:06,170
Thank you.

273
00:42:08,553 --> 00:42:08,793
Great.

274
00:42:09,874 --> 00:42:22,904
If there are no other comments on the overgrowth ordinance specifically at this time, I'd suggest we segue to the roading control ordinance, which again, really similar to this one and a lot of the issues I think are the same.

275
00:42:24,726 --> 00:42:25,506
Yes, please do.

276
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:26,167
Great.

277
00:42:26,287 --> 00:42:29,790
I'll share my screen again.

278
00:42:37,258 --> 00:42:44,622
And is it helpful if I quickly run through the original draft that was circulated last week or should we just dive right into the red line.

279
00:42:44,642 --> 00:42:53,407
I don't know if it's helpful for folks to see like the simpler document before we look at the marked up version or if it doesn't matter since we're just gonna look at the markup version anyway.

280
00:42:56,295 --> 00:42:57,757
Councilor Callahan?

281
00:42:58,919 --> 00:43:03,726
For me, I would love to just see what is different between the two.

282
00:43:03,746 --> 00:43:07,352
That would be enough for me, but I don't want to speak for anyone else.

283
00:43:08,668 --> 00:43:10,189
Okay, great.

284
00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:18,235
I'll share the red line and the versions of these from last week are again on our public portal if anybody wants to look at those.

285
00:43:19,836 --> 00:43:22,458
And Director O'Connor, I'm sorry that these weren't over to you before the meeting.

286
00:43:22,618 --> 00:43:25,780
I shared the red line versions of both of them with you during the meeting as well.

287
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:29,783
So, I need to start screen sharing.

288
00:43:33,502 --> 00:43:37,624
Okay, so again, we've already talked about why we're updating this.

289
00:43:38,065 --> 00:43:52,052
It's to strengthen the city's ability to intervene to control our rodent population and to make sure that fees and fines both that are collected in association with this ordinance can go into the rodent control revolving fund.

290
00:43:53,814 --> 00:43:59,877
So again, the solicitor has wordsmithed part of this ordinance, which I appreciate.

291
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:01,118
So there's some language changes.

292
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:20,951
And at the end of this meeting, I'll make a motion just that I review the kind of like garden variety language changes and anything that seems like it should be run by a department head, I'll run by department head before accepting or otherwise I'll just accept the language changes that are just meant to tighten how this is crafted.

293
00:44:23,405 --> 00:44:35,913
So just to go from top to bottom, some I think inconsequential language changes, the solicitors added a couple of definitions for us on the difference between private backyard composting and curbside composting.

294
00:44:36,613 --> 00:44:40,476
Again, not being an attorney I didn't want to take a stab at defining those myself, even though I

295
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:42,917
know what they are, not a lawyer.

296
00:44:42,937 --> 00:44:51,603
The solicitor has some suggestions for how the requirements for private property should be phrased.

297
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:58,467
For example, the original writing in subsection A was all properties within the city.

298
00:44:59,748 --> 00:45:05,692
Um, must be maintained free from rats, mice and other rodents.

299
00:45:06,153 --> 00:45:15,419
And it is unlawful for a property owner to fail to take such reasonable preventative and remedial measures for such purposes as prescribed by the Board of Health.

300
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,581
Um, that's kind of a mouthful.

301
00:45:18,621 --> 00:45:23,305
I think again, we just see some language changes to just sort of shift the onus there and remove that, um,

302
00:45:24,065 --> 00:45:25,185
free from language.

303
00:45:25,906 --> 00:45:40,670
The updated suggestion is all properties within the city, including private property, must be maintained to reduce and eliminate the threat of infestation by rodents, and property owners must take reasonable preventative and remedial measures when ordered by the Board of Health.

304
00:45:42,728 --> 00:45:44,149
For me, personally, I think that makes sense.

305
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:57,140
And I think, again, it seems to me that what the solicitor is driving out here is trying to get away from this language that says all property must be perfect, and rather, property owners must be responsible, and they must make changes when the Board of Health tells them it's important to do so.

306
00:45:59,442 --> 00:46:03,465
So we have some changes that are kind of along the same lines.

307
00:46:03,745 --> 00:46:11,832
Here, the suggester suggests removing a reference to the overgrowth ordinance and the wildlife feeding ordinance, just saying that's unnecessary, which is probably true.

308
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:24,005
I think some inconsequential language edits throughout this section.

309
00:46:24,025 --> 00:46:30,171
A large change occurs in subsection C, and this is again under general requirements on private property.

310
00:46:33,919 --> 00:46:49,199
The solicitor has suggested originally in the draft, the draft ordinance kind of enumerated more details on if a rodent infestation occurs, if the Board of Health observes one, what must a property owner do?

311
00:46:50,608 --> 00:47:07,912
And I think that the solicitor's suggestion is to make that language a little more general and to point towards Board of Health regulations, have those requirements kind of housed within Board of Health regulations as opposed to inside of this ordinance, which I don't necessarily disagree with.

312
00:47:08,353 --> 00:47:15,174
I would be interested to hear Director O'Connor's feedback on that, either at this meeting or when you've had a chance to review this more closely.

313
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:33,026
And just to spell it out a little bit more specifically, originally this language said, if evidence of an infestation occurs, a property owner shall take all necessary measures at the expense of the owner and or occupant to eradicate the infestation and prevent future infestation.

314
00:47:33,046 --> 00:47:36,449
In addition, catalog this to the Board of Health.

315
00:47:38,411 --> 00:47:56,088
And the solicitor suggests kind of, I think, essentially simplifying this, keeping the gist of it, but having more of the details live outside of the ordinance with language such as property owners may be required to respond to infestation or rodent burrows when evidence of an infestation occurs, including evidence of untreated burrows.

316
00:47:56,649 --> 00:47:59,392
Property owners must take all measures required by the Board of Health

317
00:47:59,932 --> 00:48:04,978
at owner's sole cost and expense in order to eradicate the infestation and prevent further infestation.

318
00:48:05,538 --> 00:48:10,264
So I don't think that this, in my read, I don't think that this weakens what we are trying to do here at all.

319
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:17,832
I think it just lets more of those details live under the jurisdiction of the Board of Health, as opposed to in our municipal code.

320
00:48:22,218 --> 00:48:35,047
One other edit that I want to flag for my fellow committee members, oh, and just to put it in Solicitor Foley's own words, he states here in a red line, prefers to have the Board of Health order what's required rather than dictate it in the ordinance.

321
00:48:35,107 --> 00:48:48,736
And I think we've seen in other ordinances, there's a benefit to that in terms of, for example, if the Board of Health's road and control policy should change in the future, that could be a vote that the Board of Health takes as opposed to having to request a legislative change.

322
00:48:49,957 --> 00:48:51,078
So I think that's worth considering.

323
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:54,453
Um...

324
00:48:56,921 --> 00:49:08,563
Originally, the draft included subsection D, which said that rodent poison should be avoided in favor of any and all other non-rat poison prevention and mitigation strategies.

325
00:49:09,703 --> 00:49:11,784
The solicitor suggests taking that out.

326
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:21,085
I suspect, again, it's his recommendation that it's not that we shouldn't be suggesting people don't use rat poison, because people should not be using rat poison.

327
00:49:21,105 --> 00:49:25,026
That's extremely bad for the ecosystem, but rather that that should live in a Board of Health Ordinance.

328
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,477
Sorry, Board of Health Regulation.

329
00:49:29,558 --> 00:49:34,219
And just to finish the review here.

330
00:49:41,781 --> 00:49:42,781
Sorry, there's a lot of comments.

331
00:49:42,801 --> 00:49:43,562
I'm scrolling through.

332
00:49:54,388 --> 00:49:56,802
I think this is one for the follow up we had discussed.

333
00:49:58,309 --> 00:50:05,591
requirements around having compromised compost bins, which is obviously if your compost bin has a hole in it, that's a vending machine for rodents.

334
00:50:06,991 --> 00:50:12,652
So it's very important that damaged compost bins or any trash receptacle be promptly replaced.

335
00:50:12,812 --> 00:50:17,453
We also talked about a program to make sure that like especially our senior residents don't have to pay the replacement fee.

336
00:50:18,614 --> 00:50:22,295
The solicitor suggests removing that.

337
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:27,576
So I think I want to follow up with him about if that's just something that he wants to have in regulation or if there's some other reason to take that out.

338
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:45,289
And then finally, we have, I believe, the same issue as we just talked about with the overgrowth ordinance in terms of fees and fines associated with this ordinance going into the revolving account.

339
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,871
That's a crux of a lot of what we're trying to do here.

340
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:58,038
So I think that we need to get on the same page with the solicitor about what is needed to make sure that those fees and fines can be deposited into the revolving account.

341
00:51:04,909 --> 00:51:15,572
I just spoke a lot, so I'll pause there to see if there are any preliminary comments or questions or clarifying questions from my fellow councillors, or if Director O'Connor would like to mention anything at this time.

342
00:51:16,252 --> 00:51:17,673
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

343
00:51:18,473 --> 00:51:20,854
Do any other councillors have any comments or questions?

344
00:51:22,814 --> 00:51:27,976
Seeing none, Vice President Collins, if you have more you'd like to address here, you can carry on.

345
00:51:31,497 --> 00:51:32,177
Great, thank you.

346
00:51:37,281 --> 00:51:56,074
I will... Thank you, and just to make sure that I note it, we also updated the fee schedule for this ordinance, and I think it's... No, I guess I was...

347
00:51:56,478 --> 00:51:59,504
I was going to say, I think that's an appendix A, but I think it's actually just attached to the ordinance.

348
00:51:59,524 --> 00:52:00,506
So it's not a separate section.

349
00:52:01,387 --> 00:52:04,734
In Unicode, we also updated

350
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:13,526
the fee schedule for roading control fees in Article 4, Section 6.

351
00:52:15,047 --> 00:52:20,791
This was with consultation from Director O'Connor just to make sure that we brought those fees kind of into the 21st century.

352
00:52:20,851 --> 00:52:27,176
Some of them for commercial owners were very low, especially compared to other communities.

353
00:52:27,657 --> 00:52:29,278
And again, this is not to be

354
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:35,324
punitive or to charge people for problems that haven't yet occurred.

355
00:52:35,484 --> 00:52:41,130
It's just to make sure that the city has the bandwidth that it needs to prevent rodent proliferation for everybody.

356
00:52:42,931 --> 00:52:49,098
So to summarize, I think that the main things to do on this ordinance

357
00:52:50,775 --> 00:53:06,979
are to assimilate the language changes that are just kind of inconsequential, that are just language improvements, to run the consequential language changes by Director O'Connor to make sure that they still capture the intent of what we were trying to do here.

358
00:53:07,699 --> 00:53:17,041
And I think the big piece of that is making sure that it makes sense what to take out of the ordinance and put into Board of Health regulations and just make sure we're aligned on what should be in the ordinance, what should be in the regulation.

359
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:30,229
And then really to nail down this piece around, are we already enabled to collect fees and put them into the revolving account?

360
00:53:31,149 --> 00:53:33,591
Is there something else that we need to tweak so that we can do that?

361
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:36,233
Or is that something that we're already clear to do and we can full steam ahead?

362
00:53:41,836 --> 00:53:42,557
Director O'Connor.

363
00:53:43,055 --> 00:53:43,275
questions.

364
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:50,641
I had a couple of quick comments when I was going through it, and again, I happy to go to the red light version and follow up with you and the city solicitor.

365
00:53:51,021 --> 00:53:53,603
But I didn't notice under section on the road ordinance.

366
00:53:54,604 --> 00:53:57,286
Under sex section 6-1 24.

367
00:53:58,727 --> 00:54:01,209
A talks about landfills or transfer stations.

368
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:05,292
We may be able to revisit that because we currently don't allow

369
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:23,886
basically of alcohol and other offensive substances, provide a copy of their pest management plan for the facility where the vehicles are garaged.

370
00:54:24,587 --> 00:54:28,549
I just think we need to specify if garaged in Medford.

371
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:33,672
So not necessarily needing their IPM if they're garaged elsewhere.

372
00:54:34,072 --> 00:54:36,014
So that's only if they're garaged in Medford?

373
00:54:36,034 --> 00:54:36,154
Yeah.

374
00:54:38,796 --> 00:54:38,996
Great.

375
00:54:39,517 --> 00:54:40,958
Thank you for the close read.

376
00:54:41,258 --> 00:54:47,744
And then the last thing I will bring up quickly is the fee schedule.

377
00:54:49,226 --> 00:54:53,850
And the food establishments, it says food establishment, food processing, our storage facility, all at $25.

378
00:54:54,250 --> 00:55:00,976
I think we may want to look at breaking out food establishment versus the food processing and storage facility.

379
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:02,550
Oh, OK.

380
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:07,432
Do you suggest that food establishment be one category and food processing or storage be?

381
00:55:07,952 --> 00:55:08,232
OK.

382
00:55:08,292 --> 00:55:08,532
Yes.

383
00:55:08,892 --> 00:55:09,572
OK, great.

384
00:55:10,673 --> 00:55:14,694
And a higher fee for the processing and storage facilities.

385
00:55:15,154 --> 00:55:15,414
Great.

386
00:55:15,454 --> 00:55:16,175
That's a good catch.

387
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,076
I'm just going to make a quick note of that.

388
00:55:27,025 --> 00:55:27,367
That's it.

389
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:27,969
Great.

390
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:28,431
Thank you.

391
00:55:28,451 --> 00:55:29,114
Thank you very much.

392
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,166
Councillor Callahan has a comment.

393
00:55:34,045 --> 00:55:34,745
Thank you.

394
00:55:35,005 --> 00:55:41,348
Mostly I just want to really thank you, Councilor Collins and also Director O'Connor for all the work that you've done on this.

395
00:55:41,408 --> 00:55:43,169
I know it's been a long time.

396
00:55:43,189 --> 00:55:45,730
I think we're nearing the final stretch.

397
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:55,134
You know, this really is what it looks like when you have a city council and administration working together to tackle the problems that matter to people here in Medford.

398
00:55:56,714 --> 00:55:59,616
And I'm glad we're getting the final legal review.

399
00:55:59,976 --> 00:56:02,557
And I really look forward to seeing the final results.

400
00:56:03,177 --> 00:56:15,343
and getting you the sort of legislative tools that you need to be able to take care of our residents in the way that I know you want to.

401
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:17,124
Thank you so much.

402
00:56:30,439 --> 00:56:32,720
Are there any motions on the floor about these two papers?

403
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:36,022
It seems like we cannot move them at the moment.

404
00:56:36,403 --> 00:56:37,243
Vice President Collins?

405
00:56:39,304 --> 00:56:39,765
Thank you.

406
00:56:39,785 --> 00:56:43,267
I'm just finishing typing out my motion.

407
00:56:43,287 --> 00:56:56,454
I would make a motion to

408
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:00,732
review.

409
00:57:00,752 --> 00:57:22,808
I would make a motion to for myself as the ordinance sponsor to review the solicitor's red line and incorporate any minor language tweaks to work with Director O'Connor and Commissioner McGivern on other edits, and then to resubmit the updated drafts to solicitor fully for additional review and feedback and to keep the paper in committee.

410
00:57:22,828 --> 00:57:25,529
Do we have a second?

411
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:27,871
Seconded.

412
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:32,950
Fair.

413
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,051
Yeah, yeah.

414
00:57:35,472 --> 00:57:36,412
British language tweaks.

415
00:57:37,013 --> 00:57:41,876
On Councillor Collins motion seconded by Councillor Callaghan.

416
00:57:41,896 --> 00:57:43,537
I can email this to you.

417
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:47,359
She will email to the clerk, assistant clerk.

418
00:57:48,019 --> 00:57:48,500
All in favour?

419
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:50,561
All opposed?

420
00:57:51,121 --> 00:57:51,842
The motion passes.

421
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:54,243
Do we have any other motions on the floor?

422
00:57:56,694 --> 00:57:59,849
on the motion of councilor saying to adjourn seconded by councillor Callahan.

423
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:00,452
All in favor?

424
00:58:00,472 --> 00:58:01,235
Aye.

425
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:02,662
All opposed?

426
00:58:02,782 --> 00:58:03,506
The motion passes.
