1
00:00:00,331 --> 00:00:03,912
So Dennis, what's the most important clause that isn't in the Constitution?

2
00:00:03,932 --> 00:00:08,033
The most important clause that's not in the Constitution?

3
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:08,533
Yep.

4
00:00:08,613 --> 00:00:09,714
Santa Clause.

5
00:00:10,174 --> 00:00:10,914
Well, you got it.

6
00:00:11,354 --> 00:00:12,554
Enough with the cheesy jokes.

7
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:14,015
Let's get back to the Mustang Report.

8
00:00:14,035 --> 00:00:20,376
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen!

9
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:24,398
For the performance of the National Anthem under the direction of Ms.

10
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:25,738
Kayla Malone.

11
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:45,958
seeing all the faces of people from the past years in the community, and one of the things I think we all pride in is getting to announce the speaker for this year's graduation.

12
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:48,980
Mr. Andy Miller!

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,667
Mr. Miller, we want to congratulate all four graduates for making it through the past few months.

14
00:00:58,147 --> 00:00:58,908
Congratulations to all of you.

15
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:01,070
Congratulations again on the accomplishments and the

16
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:05,420
This time I'd like to recognize all our teams.

17
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:26,424
for the outstanding sports season you've had this fall.

18
00:01:26,464 --> 00:01:33,487
We appreciate all your efforts and we appreciate all of you working in to represent our community in a positive and productive way.

19
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:46,452
And also to all the people that participated, the folks, our advisors, who are doing a great job keeping our high school a terrific place to go to school.

20
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:47,272
To all of the 129

21
00:01:47,932 --> 00:01:53,194
meaning I've been through it all in the second almost continuous schoolboy football rivalry in the country.

22
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:54,575
But go Mustangs!

23
00:01:54,615 --> 00:02:01,078
Gallop through the tornado, gallop through the... Congress tornado, not the golf tornado.

24
00:02:01,098 --> 00:02:01,838
And let's go Mustangs!

25
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:11,603
Every year, the Beth Tepesco Alumni Association presents a series of awards to recognize certain members of their community for their service to the students of Beth Tepesco.

26
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:18,531
This is the 2016 Young Alumni Tumor Award Ceremony.

27
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:23,693
It is being recognized for its dedication as a teacher, coach, advisor, assistant principal, and overall academic supporter.

28
00:02:23,713 --> 00:02:26,574
Please join me in recognizing the 2001 alum, Medvedov, Mr. President.

29
00:02:39,162 --> 00:02:42,064
We have a few more sponsors here.

30
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:46,766
Our only team to go in 2020 is Carter Rager and Justin Kelly.

31
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:55,671
Right now we have Ronald Cloud, Ben Keaney, Willa Driscoll, Drew Shane-Anne, and Judy Gail Bass.

32
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:10,280
So I'd like to take this time to acknowledge the members of the boys and girls soccer teams who are both DVL All-Stars.

33
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:12,665
For the girls, Isabelle Sanchez.

34
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:31,459
For the boys in the second team of All-Stars, Joao Lucio Correa, Noah Correa, Ryan Palmer, Jimmy Green.

35
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,439
First team of All-Stars, Igor Sousa-Guerra, Josh Westbrook, and last team of All-Stars,

36
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:59,787
This is America's fourth time beating our world's farm, three times beating the United States' world's farm, three times on the state board.

37
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:24,682
Till I collapse, I'm spillin' these racks long as you feel em' Till the day that I drop, you'll never say that I'm not killin' em' Cause when I am not, then I'ma start killin' em' and I am not

38
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:34,197
You're coming with me, feel it or not You're gonna fear it like I showed you

39
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:49,555
hear the spirit of God lives in us.

40
00:04:49,575 --> 00:04:50,576
You hear it a lot.

41
00:04:50,616 --> 00:04:51,396
Lyrics that shock.

42
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:54,059
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop?

43
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,060
Listen up.

44
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,181
This isn't a whistle.

45
00:04:56,221 --> 00:04:57,402
This is the plot.

46
00:04:57,482 --> 00:04:57,902
Listen up.

47
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,163
Your prayers is for God.

48
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:01,205
Slizzle does not give up.

49
00:05:22,444 --> 00:05:47,815
Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get when you're real and you spit And people are feeling it, this is your moment, and every single minute you spend Tryna hold on to it, cause you may never get it again So while you're in it, try to get as much as you can And when your run is over, just admit when it's in its end Cause I'm at the end of my wits without the shit that gets in I got a list, here's the order of my list and it's in It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac, and Biggie

50
00:05:53,822 --> 00:06:08,903
I put on this list, this s*** is not a thing That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me Even though half you people got a s*** problem with me You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me The press is wet dream, like Bob and your Whitney, they hit me Till the roof comes off, till the

51
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,035
I feel I ever deserve, but I'll never be served.

52
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:43,537
My spot is forever reserved.

53
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:46,322
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first.

54
00:06:46,543 --> 00:06:49,047
Because in my heart of hearts, I know nothing could ever be worse.

55
00:07:12,824 --> 00:07:19,987
Good job, good job, good job!

56
00:07:20,047 --> 00:07:21,747
Nice job, good job!

40.

68
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:10,714

Nice job, Zach and Morgan!

100
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:06,776
I actually turned out six a year ago.

101
00:09:06,816 --> 00:09:07,056
Damn!

102
00:09:37,429 --> 00:09:39,554
Come on, D.B.!

00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:41,638
Come on, D.B.! !

Hi, how are you doing?

Alright, that's nice of you to say, huh?

7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

Does she look beautiful?

111
00:10:39,212 --> 00:10:39,252
So,

112
00:10:53,077 --> 00:10:54,577
We're going to put some stuff in here to see if we can win it.

113

I said so I keep big bills up in my heart on the dirty like blood so ain't got no twist in my head but I'm still drippin'
