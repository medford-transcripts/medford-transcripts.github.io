00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:27,537
Hello, everyone. Looks like we have a quorum, so I will get this meeting started. Recording in progress. Oh, Nicole, your camera needs to be... Oh, there you go. It was just the light. Yeah. All right. And we are recording.

2
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:51,044
Welcome everyone to the October 7th, 2025 Rules and Policy Subcommittee meeting of the Medford School Committee. Please be advised that on October 7th, 2025 at 4.30 PM, there will be a Rules and Policy Subcommittee meeting held through, excuse me, remote participation via Zoom. This meeting is being recorded.

3
00:00:52,647 --> 00:01:14,804
The meeting can be viewed live on Medford Public Schools YouTube channel through Medford Community Media on your local cable channel, Comcast 9, 8, or 22, Verizon 43, 45, and 47. Since the meeting will be held remotely, participants can log or call in by using the following link or number. The, but that's on the,

4
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:27,916
There's no phone number listed, but if you are actually listening to this, then you probably already know all that. We should get the phone number on those agendas.

5
00:01:29,587 --> 00:01:59,573
Additionally, questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing me at pruseau at medford.k12.ma.us. Those submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, or if you are an employee, just indicate that, your question or comment. The agenda for today is to take up the motion to move the management of life-threatening allergies policy to the Rules and Policy Subcommittee as

6
00:01:59,573 --> 00:02:29,257
amended to include staffing and policy. I forget the date. This was, I think it was May when we did that. So it's 24 pages. So let me just- June 18th. June 18th, thank you. Oh, I need to take a roll call. Let me open up my mail and record that. Member Grant.

7
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:40,343
Here. Member Bramley. Here. And Member Rousseau. Here. All right. All present. We have a quorum.

8
00:02:40,985 --> 00:03:09,453
So I wanted to start off with, if anybody has any specific parts of this that they wanna talk about, we can go to that. I don't think reading a 24 page policy is gonna get us done in the next six months. And it's actually all on the agenda. So hopefully people have had a chance to read it. I will screen share when we get to that part, when people have something they wanna look at. So we don't have to,

9
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:31,745
to the imagine if you will kind of approach. I want to welcome the superintendent, Mr. O'Leary, our new director of, I forgot the technical title of the department is. Athletics, is that right? Is it just called department? Sorry, I should know that. And of course, our director of nursing. Sorry.

10
00:03:31,998 --> 00:03:58,576
And community schools. Okay, and community schools, right. And I thought it was longer than that. And our director of nursing, Ms. Silva, and we also have our director of food services, Rhetta Smith. And I think that's everybody I should be acknowledging real quick. So does anybody want to start with any comments on this? This is not our first rodeo on this.

11
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:14,793
I just have a couple of questions. Okay, so when we talked about this back in June, we talked about wanting to.

12
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:36,089
Engage some of the folks who are, I'll say, implicated in this policy who we don't particularly have direct control over, like the in particular Rob is here from an athletics perspective. So that's great. And I'm just curious if that has been done and what the feedback was.

13
00:04:39,633 --> 00:05:05,587
So I did send this to the PTO leaders. I have not heard back from really any of them. When we were developing this policy, though, we did speak to some PTO members who gave us feedback on what was here, which is why some of the items that are included here are included in the policy. And what was their feedback? Like, I feel like overall, like,

14
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:34,493
Our PTOs are super interested in helping. But this, to me, my read of this is that we are substantially changing how PTOs are being asked to operate when it comes to food. So I'm just curious what their reactions were. Yeah. Shanine, are you on the call? Because I think she had a little bit more feedback from PTOs than I did. I am.

15
00:05:34,730 --> 00:06:02,557
just walking back from the skate park opening, so pardon. So we spoke at length with both Misituk and Roberts PTO. And I mean, I guess I want to take a step back really quickly, and I will answer that question. But I want to start this meeting acknowledging that the reason we are here is because children can die. That is the reason we are doing this policy.

16
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:33,607
There is a fear every time, go find the back, because I told you to, go. There is a fear every time I send my child or any of us with children with life-threatening allergies, send our child to soccer practice or lunch in the cafeteria or a birthday party or any of that, that someone is going to make a mistake and we are going to get that call. That is why we are here.

17
00:06:34,990 --> 00:07:04,285
And we want to make sure that it is easy. And I don't think anything in this policy is an unreasonable expectation for anybody. But I just wanted to ground us, because I think that in June when we met, that part, that importance of why this policy needs to exist, and the reason we made the recommendations we did, is to keep children safe and included in their school communities. So as for the PTOs,

18
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:33,057
Roberts and Misitoka. Misitoka already does a lot in terms of considering allergies and Roberts talked about there being a difference between when the PTOs are serving food as a fundraiser purpose, when the grown-ups are going to be buying food, and when they are serving food to children for some sort of special event.

19
00:07:33,850 --> 00:08:02,133
and the importance of labeling. And did we get any feedback from the middle schools or the high school? Because I think the conversation changes over time, right? As someone with a life-threatening allergy myself,

20
00:08:02,707 --> 00:08:30,314
100% understand the need for the policy. I just am trying to understand how we have engaged the people whose workflows, as they were, we're asking to change so that we can be useful and helpful to them as they do that. Yeah, unfortunately, we did not hear back from middle school and high school PTOs.

21
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:47,628
So I do think that we are asking for a change, but to follow on what Shane said, I don't think any of it's really unreasonable. I think a lot of it is going to just focus around, one, making sure that people are aware of food allergies, because I think that part of what

22
00:08:47,628 --> 00:09:05,853
This policy is attempting to do is just make sure people are more educated. You know, there was just, for example, homecoming was last weekend and a kiddo came to the high school nursing office asking if there was going to be an option for kids who were gluten free. And at that moment in time, there were not any options for kids who were gluten free. And so the school nurse and the principal work together.

23
00:09:05,853 --> 00:09:25,462
to make sure that that would happen. And so I guess what we're trying to say is, hey, like, we need people to be aware of these things that we do make sure that one, we're keeping kids safe, and that we're being inclusive. And I think those are the two pieces that this is trying to accomplish. Yeah, and I think that's, like, actually a great example. Right? Like,

24
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:46,049
If you don't have a food allergy yourself, and there's, by the way, a million versions of food allergies. So, even if you have 1, it doesn't mean you're particularly tuned into them all. And without the right support, the organizers of events.

25
00:09:46,201 --> 00:10:09,691
are doing their best and not intending really to cause a problem. And then there's this scramble that happens when this comes up. So I think one question, the reason that I am asking about their involvement is because I think we have to, for this policy to be successful, we have to figure out how to

26
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:40,218
shift that conversation so that it is not happening at the last minute when people begin to feel excluded, when people are already sort of in like final prep mode, right? And now we're saying, drop everything about your day and help us solve this problem. So I think one question that I, the reason that I care so much about this is because I think if done right,

27
00:10:40,910 --> 00:11:10,863
we can be hugely assistive in this process. And I'm curious what that looks like at different levels. I think the conversation's completely different at elementary school than it is at high school for a whole variety of reasons. So I do want to hear their voices in this conversation, because I think that's super important. The other thing that struck me about this policy is that,

28
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:36,935
There's a lot going on in this policy that I think is going to make it hard for us to get compliance against. It's 22 pages. It does include roles and responsibilities, which are governed by labor contracts. So it's not enough for us to put it in a policy and then expect that everybody will

29
00:11:38,420 --> 00:12:07,242
be able to do those things. There are some tentacles there that we have to think through. But I think overall, if there is a way for us to separate the policy from the education and the assistive pieces of this, I think all of those pieces will get much more use than this living in its current format, because I think the current format is

30
00:12:07,698 --> 00:12:22,700
hard to digest. And I don't think that's the intention. I think it's intended to be very useful. But I think it has to be parsed a little bit differently for that to really work in practice.

31
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:51,488
Okay. And I think, I mean, I do think that makes sense. I think the intention was, the way we tried to make it more user-friendly is that you are a teacher and you go directly to your section. You were an administrator, you go directly to your section. So that is why it's so long. It's because we really tried to parse out, okay, who's responsible for what different things. But I do, and actually Rob and I had this conversation earlier today about needing to involve, you know, our collective bargaining and what are we looking at when we're looking at roles and responsibilities as well. So that totally makes sense.

32
00:12:51,488 --> 00:13:10,861
I do think that we could reconvene our team who's worked on this to look at how do we parse out the policy and then have those roles and responsibilities as like separate appendices that are in here. If that would be a good way to do it, I'd be open to any thoughts. Yeah, my thoughts on this are.

33
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:26,200
you know, just from a policy hygiene, my new favorite word around policy, is that, you know, we can have, and the way the structure of policies, there's like a national policy

34
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:50,652
sort of like the old Dewey Decimal System, if you will, there's like a structure that makes no sense to anybody, but that there is one, is that we have like the top level policy, and then you have other policies that are just under it rather than part of the same policy. And what I like about that is that you can really target, well, you can target

35
00:13:51,142 --> 00:14:20,825
training, you can say building administrators, you really all need to know this and it's not 24 pages long as we all agree is too much. But also, there's so much that is in here that different people who are coming, the different audiences of this are just not interested in. Like, this isn't relevant to them. So by burying it there, we're asking an awful lot of people to

36
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:52,381
to find it, get lucky and find it in the index of, you know, a whole page index. So yeah, breaking it up so that it is, meets the different audiences, but also the different purposes that multiple audience members might come to this. Shanee? I want to push back a little bit on the length of it being so problematic because

37
00:14:53,393 --> 00:15:21,794
part of the whole design was to make sure that if you that you could figure out without having to parse all the different roles, what is the role of this person? What is the role of this person? And it repeats those things a lot, which is a lot of the length of it. But it actually should be easier to find like, I'm a para, what's the policy? What's my responsibility versus what is my, my lead teachers responsibility versus the health director, all of those things that actually divides those roles in a way that's much clearer.

38
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:36,982
And I do want to remind this group that we, all of these, even splitting out the roles was based on the recommendations of the best policies group at Food Allergy Research and Education and the CDC.

39
00:15:38,062 --> 00:16:03,020
You know, when I think about, but like a policy that's, here's the policy that is just pointers to the other sections, like the index. I don't want to suggest that I'm lazy, but when I see a 24 page document I have to read, I don't just plop down, I have to figure out when do I have time to read 24 pages, even though I might only really need to read two.

40
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:32,011
It's just like when we get emails and they scroll and scroll and scroll. I'll get to that later, which often means we don't get to it. And I don't think of that as just a time management problem. I think that is an information overload. So like, yeah, so that's just my thoughts. I mean, we did take the bullying policy down from, I don't remember, dozens of pages down to

41
00:16:32,298 --> 00:16:58,623
a number that we all agreed, there's no excuse for not having read it. But I think that, I mean, some of the people who will be needing this are working three hours a day. So when are we expecting them to, I mean, I guess that's professional development and administrative management problem, not mine, but superintendent, I think you have something you wanna say.

42
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:08,377
Having been at multiple levels in the district, I think something like this is important to

43
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:36,187
make sure that we're providing information. Something like food allergies is something that is constantly ever evolving, fluid, new allergies are coming on all the time. There's a lot of conversation and discussion at every school building between the nursing office, caregivers, teachers, school leaders, and

44
00:17:36,187 --> 00:17:59,592
every time there are like new allergies that are added to this list and then ways that you have to now think in order to prepare spaces and make students make sure that students are included and that those pieces are there on behalf of our students. So I think the informational part and the discussion part is for sure needed

45
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:12,653
um around food allergies, food allergy awareness, food allergy training. I think the only you know the piece that's like really resonating with me is that there because

46
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:39,232
It's, the way it's organized, I appreciate having all the different roles and responsibilities right there for our employees and for our community. But we just have to do a level of communication that I think we haven't really done yet in terms of like having, getting people around a table and talking to them about what this means. I don't think it's something that we can just like send out

47
00:18:39,232 --> 00:19:03,042
and then expect that people are gonna like read it, and there's this like level of compliance. Of course, member Graham already mentioned the piece around a lot of these people are bargaining members that we really have to work through, but there's just a lot of, in my opinion, levels of conversation that we just have to have before I think we can proceed with

48
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:31,004
making this an official policy? And I don't know if the conversation is, is this a policy? Is this guidance? But I just think we need to plan some conversations. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. I think it's, I think it's both. I think there are clear policy statements in here like,

49
00:19:32,202 --> 00:19:56,823
threats of harassment for students with food allergies will be taken seriously and dealt with in accordance with a reference to our bullying policy. That is a policy statement. An allergy table is not something we're going to do as a policy statement. And I think those things belong in a compressed format in terms of what we as a collective are and aren't going to do.

50
00:19:57,413 --> 00:20:25,983
But the second part of it is the guidance. And I do think it's super helpful for people to have guidance that like they can go to their part and understand what their part is. And there should be one for coaches because coaches are gonna deal with like a kind of a different, like slice of all of this, right? Then PTOs, then paras. So that piece to me, like sort of like,

51
00:20:26,607 --> 00:20:36,243
Snaps out and becomes guidance like. This is our policy. This is where you go for guidance and the guidance.

52
00:20:36,935 --> 00:21:01,522
I would like my preference would be that the maintenance of that guidance can reside with the director of nursing and not necessitate like a big policy review. If something has to change, because I think what will happen in practice is things will evolve and change and we want to be responsive to them. And as soon as your documentation is out of date, it is useless. So.

53
00:21:01,522 --> 00:21:29,062
we can't, you know, if something needs to change because it was confusing or in practice, like somebody asked a question and we're like, that's a great point. We should include that. We should include that in the guidance for PTOs. Whatever that may be, like being able to change it so that that guidance is applicable and resonates with the people it's intended to be supportive of is,

54
00:21:30,293 --> 00:21:57,091
to me, ideal. And that doesn't happen in a policy that requires subcommittee and multiple readings. If something is needing to be changed in real time, I want it to be able to be changed in real time. So I think if we think about, to me, there's two pieces, policy and guidance. And there's maybe some overlap of things that are not going to change in a really wily way. But I think

55
00:21:58,154 --> 00:22:24,631
I want to get both pieces right and put the right things in the right bucket. So I don't think it's necessarily that structurally the repetition is bad. I think that repetition belongs in the guidance and not in the policy. But when I look at policy, actually, I was just talking to somebody about,

56
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:36,848
Our policy and it was also very long and I said, you know, in summary, our policy is this and I said it in like, 2 and a half sentences. It was very long.

57
00:22:38,232 --> 00:23:04,456
And it substantively was the same as two and a half sentences. So I'm always a fan of the policy being like really crisp and concise. So there can be no confusion. We don't do allergy tables. We take bullying seriously, whatever those things are so that it's simple to know what we're expected to implement. The guidance then has to back it up.

58
00:23:04,996 --> 00:23:18,580
So I think, to me, that's like there's two things happening in this document, and they both have to happen, but I don't think they should happen in the same document. God.

59
00:23:18,968 --> 00:23:35,827
Yes, so I just saw this this morning for the first time, but a couple of things that I can't agree with more that was just said almost so. But the biggest thing I think from athletic standpoint is I want more parents involved. I want more people involved.

60
00:23:35,827 --> 00:24:01,713
And I feel like the first line of a couple of things like team dinners, we have to have a menu set before that. That as an athletic director, as a coach, is going to be next to impossible. And I'm not a fan of putting policy in that we can't follow through with. If we have a team dinner that we didn't even know about because the kids put it on or the parents put it on or something outside of the school. Jen and I talked about this this morning a little bit.

61
00:24:01,713 --> 00:24:28,342
That's a lot different than something that's happening inside of the school or at somebody's house, right? I love the fact a lot of districts use like a letter that is sent out. I did a little quick research after Jen and I met this afternoon that is sent out to like a team that says, doesn't tell you who, but somebody on the team has celiac disease. And if you're planning a team dinner, please be aware of this, right? So if we could get that information and then, you know,

62
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:55,105
foster it out through the nursing office or through my office, I guess me, is like, if we can get that information and then get it out to the teams, and it doesn't have to be a policy, but more of a guidance of like, you know, someone on the team has this allergy, or someone on the team has this allergy, and then we can hope that the parents follow through with that. And also, I think that

63
00:24:55,105 --> 00:25:19,085
The biggest thing I saw in that was just the change of a job description for a coach. If we're making it a policy, as a former union president, I would say that we'd have to at least change our job descriptions and add it somewhere in the job postings when we're doing it that we want them to

64
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:45,190
take the allergy course and pass it, because right now they're not doing that. And if we're going to do that, we should probably add it in for the next season that we're going to post coaching positions. We have concussions. We have things that Jen and I talked about earlier, the concussion, the CPI, the first aid. It's not a major thing to add it, but we should add it if we're looking to get that done sooner rather than later.

65
00:25:45,865 --> 00:25:56,075
But that team dinner thing is what jumped out at me right away, because sometimes we don't even know about a team dinner that happens.

66
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:18,147
I guess my question, and this is, this is not my general sphere, but what's the difference in terms of enforceability between a guidance and a policy? Because I mean, even just what Mr. O'Leary just said of hoping the parents follow through on that, like, team dinners are a prime

67
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:46,345
issue for kids having accidental reactions. So I just, what is the difference, Paul, between or? Yeah, the difference, there's no difference, both written policy of the school committee, as well as guidance that the superintendent essentially is issuing. In both cases, it's the superintendent who's responsible for endorsement. So it really falls to how the superintendent is willing to enforce

68
00:26:48,134 --> 00:27:07,068
So anything that is not, so we don't have a life-threatening allergy policy today, but that isn't that we don't actually have, we don't have an official school committee policy. But the district and the superintendent, what they say is policy unless we have overridden it.

69
00:27:07,068 --> 00:27:29,495
so everything that's missing from our policy manual is not that it's just a you know wild west it it's the up to the central administration and their their what they say is policy if the school committee has not spoken on it um which of course is totally the opposite of anything legislative in any other setting where until it's

70
00:27:29,495 --> 00:27:58,030
the legislative body has said something, it doesn't exist. But I think that's part of the 1993 Ed Reform Act that gave that kind of authority to superintendents. And some of it is just to principals too, which I find a little annoying that sometimes principals have authority that actually the superintendent doesn't have. But anyways, we don't need to rehash that. But I think that the team dinner is like a really good example of like,

71
00:27:58,688 --> 00:28:17,572
We can have a policy, but without the right support in place, a parent with good intentions could do something that causes harm, right?

72
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:31,831
Nobody's intending to do that. But the question then becomes like, to Shanine's point about consequence, right? Like, we can't consequence a parent.

73
00:28:32,388 --> 00:28:56,468
who didn't provide an alternative, right? Like, what are we going to do, kick their kid off the team? Like, are we going to suspend the kid? Like, we don't have, like, enforcement authority in those situations. So what we have to do instead is make it exceedingly easy for people to be able to comply. And so when you talk about team dinners,

74
00:28:57,245 --> 00:29:22,810
It should be, I think, pretty simple for the coaches at the beginning of the season when they finalize their roster to collect the food allergies that are there. And then if there is a parent who is wanting to host a dinner, that list can be passed to them. So it's not their responsibility to go ask all the kids

75
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:51,700
what their food allergies are. And at the high school level, by the way, you're going to get more answers from the kids than you are from the parents. And only if the kids sort of decide to respond. And it doesn't mean they're not going to show up at your house like, surprise, I have this allergy. And now there's something happening. So I think there are some ways for us to engage

76
00:29:52,645 --> 00:30:15,427
with some basic systems in place to be proactive. And then at the beginning, when the coaches are having their meeting with parents, they're saying, we want to have team dinners. We encourage you to do that. And if you're going to do that, here are some things that you need to know about our team so that we can keep everybody safe. And then it's not about like,

77
00:30:15,562 --> 00:30:37,634
failure and consequences, which we really don't sort of have the authority to do. But instead about, let me make this easy for you. Like, Lucas wants to have a team dinner. And I was like, okay, we can do that. What do you serve a bunch of teenage boys? Like, it seems like it would be very complicated. And he said, Oh, he went to a team dinner and they serve lasagna. And I'm like,

78
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:55,083
wild that no one has celiacs. I don't know if that's true or not. Right. But I was like, well, I'm glad everyone likes lasagna. And then he's like, well, there was a lot left over. And I'm like, maybe they didn't like lasagna. It's hard to know, right? Like every the team changes all the time. So I think like as a parent, like,

79
00:30:55,336 --> 00:31:24,378
I'm happy to open up my home and do those things. But it sure would be nice if somebody could hand me a little roadmap on how to do that and be successful, right? Both in a safety perspective and also, I'm not serving anyone shellfish in my house because that is my life-threatening allergy. But there's plenty of others that would happen that sort of evolve in my house. I just realized I was eating a container of nuts while we were talking, ironically.

80
00:31:24,378 --> 00:31:46,147
But it sure would be nice if it could just be a little bit easier for people to engage in those ways that we want them to, and it would keep everyone safe too, right? Like, which is actually the point. I think parents will as much appreciate the assistance in being able to, like, show up for their kids in these ways.

81
00:31:50,062 --> 00:32:10,818
So I think I just have one question. If we were to sever their part of their responsibilities, all of these boxes of what everybody is going to do, where do we put it and how do we enforce it? Is there really a way to enforce it? I mean, as it being guidance?

82
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:41,176
I mean, we don't. We're kind of doing it now. And you know what I mean? Probably not to this extent. I mean, I was a para. So, you know, that was always a topic of conversation, especially in the classroom day to day. We we always I don't think there was ever a class that didn't have an allergy of some sort in there. And having snack, especially as kindergartners in the classroom, it was something that was, you know, the topic at all times. I check snacks as a para just to make sure everybody was safe.

83
00:32:41,176 --> 00:33:02,945
So I mean, I guess to have some sort of guidance is great, because I think sometimes we do lack that with, you know, lots of different things, you know, like you kind of get put in a position and you're like, okay, this is what I'm doing now. But how do we separate maybe these boxes of responsibilities for people without violating anything in the

84
00:33:03,704 --> 00:33:32,611
CBAs, right? How do we incorporate all of this to be good guidance, but a really crisp policy on its own? So first off, our muscle is the superintendent. She is our enforcer. And I hope somebody does an AI version of that. But I think what you would find in policies that would be something like the superintendent

85
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:46,702
or designee, sorry, will create and maintain roles and responsibilities and annually ensure that all relevant staff

86
00:33:46,921 --> 00:34:03,560
are aware of those instead of specifying what those are. And I think that that is, you know, when you think about like federal legislation, like that legislation almost always says some department will go off and figure out what we really meant.

87
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:28,636
That's what most laws do not say actually what should happen. They say somebody who's an expert will go off and write the regulations, CMF, the regulations that make sense because the legislators, and in this case, the school committee, even if we do have it, the problem is that, and remember Graham mentioned this earlier, is that

88
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:47,958
our ability to respond quickly to needs to changes in policy is limited. I mean, just by the number of meetings we have and by the fact that we have 180 backlogged policies, we still need to update. And frankly, I had been working to get this done since

89
00:34:47,958 --> 00:35:17,101
Tony was the director, like we were communicating back then. And so we at that time, we were also taking the, you know, throw it all in kitchen sink kind of approach. So I think that in that time, we haven't had official school committee policy. And I think part of that is because we were including too much and at this hands up. So who was next?

90
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:46,345
Maybe it was me. All right, go ahead, Jen. I just want to say, so clearly, we were trying to make this as easy as possible for people, right? Like, that's part of why we broke it down into the roles and responsibilities. I definitely see the difference between having this policy and this guidance. But to Nicole's point, like, right, like, yes, the superintendent can help us enforce. But a lot of this is stuff we're already doing, already asking of people to do that they're not doing.

91
00:35:46,497 --> 00:35:59,862
So for example, when we're asking principals to not have allergy tables in their cafeterias, there are schools- And you have an implementation problem. You don't have a policy problem, right? Okay. Yeah.

92
00:36:00,655 --> 00:36:20,483
So, and I think whether it's policy or guidance, it only works if you're going to roll it out and you're going to tell everybody what's expected of them. And until you do that, the compliance is not going to be there. Not because people are being willful and ignoring.

93
00:36:20,483 --> 00:36:41,881
Maybe maybe they are at the moment, but from a change management perspective, you have to tell people what you expect of them before you can expect to see change. So, once we figure this out, there probably needs to be some professional development that is targeted so that.

94
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:59,988
Not just does everyone understand what the policy is, but they understand why so that they can get on the bus with the change and like, you know, carrot stick, we're going to use them all. But, like, if people still have allergy tables, there needs to be some dialogue about why.

95
00:37:00,207 --> 00:37:15,378
And what help do they need to make the move in their building? Because the move is happening. So tell us what you need, and then let's make that happen. That's how you make change. So once this is all said and done, there does have to be

96
00:37:15,378 --> 00:37:32,725
Like, a relevel set, because there are people who've been in our buildings for, like, 25 years. They're like, I've been here for 25 years. Of course, I know about allergies. Well, do you? Maybe you thought you did, but you don't. So we do have, like, that to me is about implementation.

97
00:37:32,725 --> 00:37:57,127
and having a thoughtful implementation plan that goes with this so that the coaches have a space to go and be like, Rob, this is just too much. I don't know how I'm going to do this. We need people to articulate those kinds of reactions and implementation because only once they do, can you then work that apart and actually help them be successful.

98
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:24,346
But it's a little bit more complicated than just saying, do what I told you to do, if what you really want is compliance and results. So it's incredibly painful. And Rhetta has her hand up. So I don't want to like, jump, although I am jumping in front of her. I'm sorry, Rhetta. But I think that just I just want to like, kind of punctuate what you just said member Graham only because that's the piece that I'm talking about. When I mentioned that

99
00:38:25,645 --> 00:38:50,502
we have to have explicit, intentional conversations. And to my knowledge, those haven't started yet. And if they, on a global level, that's going to meet all of these roles right here. And that's the piece that I think is where we need to go in the next, like as our next step to this. Because I don't know

100
00:38:52,072 --> 00:39:09,807
I don't know how it like explicit it's been or how many conversations have been with this specific roles that are like listed here. And I think Jen and I can do that. With Rhetta. Sorry, go ahead.

101
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:37,212
That's okay. I wanted to, I don't know if it's a point of clarification or just maybe I'm a little bit confused, but I thought that with this policy, really our intention in talking about PTOs and other activities was going to be things that were, you know, explicitly sponsored by the schools or part of the PTOs. And Jen has a thing, I don't know, substantive,

102
00:39:37,516 --> 00:39:55,403
assistance or something that makes the PTOs kind of come under the authority of the school policies, rather than a parent who wants to invite all of the kids over on a team to have dinner. You know, if the

103
00:39:56,483 --> 00:40:25,998
a booster club is, you know, putting it on. I know like the track dinners we did in the school. So, of course, like we followed lots of rules with those meals that were being provided. And just trying to say that it's not like if anybody wants to try to feed kids outside of school hours, these rules do not apply to them. But I think just in my experience, there are things that are being put on by the schools or the PTOs that,

104
00:40:26,285 --> 00:40:51,597
aren't considering the needs of students who have food allergies, many of them who have 504s that explicitly say that accommodations will be made, but they're not. And they're just, it's not, it's not really something that's being considered. Thank you for bringing that up. This is sort of a question I don't, I don't know the answer to, but,

105
00:40:52,610 --> 00:41:20,842
If you have a team of 20 students, 20 athletes, and the coach, every time there's a change in the roster says, or at the beginning of the season, can I get a list of food allergies so that I can send this around to the parents? I'm just wondering about, and when there's 20, that's one thing. What if it's a very small group?

106
00:41:20,842 --> 00:41:37,582
Or, one kid joins and now there is a food allergy. How do we deal with the privacy related issues there? I don't know what they are, what they aren't, and I'm just very curious about that.

107
00:41:38,712 --> 00:41:57,173
Because obviously keeping people safe, it can't just be on us. It's like with the summer school stuff that we've offered. If a kid's on an IEP and they don't want the summer camp folks that we have to know, well then that kid will go.

108
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:15,955
the disabilities that the kid has will not be known by the staff, which is not ideal. But we can't just hand over that kind of information, even to people that work for us in the summer program. So I'm curious about that. And Jen, do you have an answer?

109
00:42:17,052 --> 00:42:40,137
Yes, so we obviously can't provide lists of students matched to their food allergies. We can provide general information. But the other thing that we can do is ask parents to provide that information on sports registrations on club registration. So this is something that does really well with their after school clubs. They ask for that information on the after school club registration. So that way, it's the parents providing that information directly to the after school.

110
00:42:40,137 --> 00:43:10,006
club volunteers or, you know, because it's run by the PTO. Rob and I actually talked about today that we can incorporate it into sports registration. So that is not that it's not on us, like the nurses sharing that information or the trainer. It's the parents sharing that information directly. And you could also just ask the parents to say, I am also authorizing that this can be shared with people on the team who may be involved in providing food. Right. Like, I think you could also ask parents, like,

111
00:43:10,293 --> 00:43:39,622
at registration, which is like the perfect place to do it. Because whether you're going to respond to the coach mid-season or not, like you do have to just do your kid. So like that is the perfect place. And if you're willing, you know, and if you say, yes, my kid has an allergy and yes, you can tell people about it, then it's a real, it's a real easy thing for the coach to hand over the list to somebody who needs it. And I also think like when you're talking about team dinners, you're usually talking about high school.

112
00:43:40,347 --> 00:43:53,003
And by the time high school rolls around, food allergies are something kids are very accustomed to. There's food allergies all around them all the time.

113
00:43:54,083 --> 00:44:23,108
Kids talk. Kids are going to talk about that stuff much more openly, I think, than if you were talking about much younger kids anyway. So I tell everybody who needs to know about my life-threatening allergy, because it's like a defense mechanism, right? It's how I keep myself safe when somebody puts shellfish stock in something that has nothing to do with shellfish. So I do think that's a great.

114
00:44:24,087 --> 00:44:37,182
Operational way to like, collect and distribute this information without putting the district in the middle of like. Privacy concerns, but we, we could also run that by our attorney.

115
00:44:38,060 --> 00:45:07,338
Yeah, it all sounds operational, like it can be operationalized. I had forgotten about registration forms. I was just thinking like the coach sends a list to the nurse and the nurse writes a list back and that kind of made me nervous because then what does the coach do with the list, sends it out to parents. That freaked me out a bit, but glad to see there's an alternative to that. So looking at the policy right now,

116
00:45:08,587 --> 00:45:25,310
I'm looking at the sections and what parts I think would be better as statements that the superintendent will create and maintain guidance.

117
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:46,353
updated at some regular frequency, published on our website. I feel like that's kind of language we can plop in a bunch of places. Because I think having it visible outside of just training purposes would be helpful because, you know, Shanine and others will be like,

118
00:45:47,332 --> 00:46:17,150
Checking it out and being like, oh, look at that. That doesn't look like it's been updated with this new information because you know there's always more information than there is time to consume it. So I think having that very publicly facing. It's also worth noting that the policy itself can include links to district resources. So you know if we establish a.

119
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:42,277
just establish a URL that can or a web page, a landing page that has stuff. And we can include that right in the policy because I mean, people will come at this from different perspectives and different points of knowledge. Some people will be like, I go to the Memphis School Committee's policy website all the time, which I'm sure is just me and six other people. But, you know, I don't know who they are.

120
00:46:43,222 --> 00:46:51,237
I'm one of them. But anyways, if they do that, I think it's important that they can find that. I also think that...

121
00:46:51,929 --> 00:47:18,018
I'm always trying to be considerate of future school committees because the administration, the employees of the district, you have an awful lot to do. And I remember when I joined, I was a headache. I was meeting with every director and asking them all kinds of questions. And I wasn't always pleased with the answers, but it'd be nice if the answers were actually things I could have gotten on my own so you could keep doing your work.

122
00:47:18,018 --> 00:47:28,885
So having that as facing outward is, I think, really important. Suzanne? I just want to also say when

123
00:47:29,898 --> 00:47:56,324
because of the length of this, when we do get this to a place where it's ready or to your point when you talked about wanting to have this forward facing on the website, very important. We need to have all things there that are accessible to families. But I do think this is a document that we would want to send out for translation because of the length and because of the content. And that also has a little bit of a

124
00:47:56,324 --> 00:48:10,904
turnaround time, and also to just be mindful that whatever links we're putting in here that directs families to other resources, that we know that we're directing families to translated links.

125
00:48:11,292 --> 00:48:36,773
Absolutely, yes, that's a good point. So how does this sound for the next little bit? That we go through the sections and we identify sections we think would be better as guidance. I'm not going to draft the exact language right now. I can do that when we're not all meeting. But to just essentially do what I said,

126
00:48:36,773 --> 00:49:04,853
the superintendent will blah, blah, blah. I don't have to repeat what I said earlier. And I just think it would be good if we're all on the same page about what sections we really think need to stay in the policy. And I don't think we'll all necessarily agree on that. But is this fitting on everybody's screen? I have a massive monitor. So is this fitting comfortably for you all?

127
00:49:06,828 --> 00:49:19,113
Good. I see some shaking heads. Okay, good. So I think obviously the policy statement, every policy should have a policy statement. So I think that that's fine. Anybody disagree?

128
00:49:21,914 --> 00:49:43,109
Just raise your hands if you want to comment on a section as I go through it. I think this what is an allergy thing is great, frankly, and I don't think of it as something that's likely to change very often. And I don't know, Jen, do you agree that that's very unlikely to change?

129
00:49:43,497 --> 00:50:08,573
Yeah, this is a pretty standard definition that's been around for a while. OK, great. I actually think the allergy triggers is wildly educational. I wouldn't naturally want to put it in the policy, but I just feel like it is this also something that isn't likely to change? Because these are the bigger categories of and then what could change is what's within them. But these are the bigger categories.

130
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:35,894
Actually, I think it's super important to have the visuals. Yeah. Because it's going to increase understanding. I'm actually wondering if we could make those larger. OK. Well, we'll worry about that later. Anybody else have comments on just keeping the allergy trigger section? Great. I mean, I learned so much in this section right here, by the way. That's the point, Paul.

131
00:50:36,468 --> 00:50:49,867
I know, right? The education piece is something that I think was shockingly, like when I came into the district as an allergy parent,

132
00:50:50,305 --> 00:51:20,140
I had to teach some medical staff that you can't use sanitizer to remove allergens. And COVID made that way harder, that like anaphylaxis is not just a breathing emergency. Like there are basic things that people just do not understand. So some piece of the educational bit should be easily accessible and widely disseminated. Yep, so. I think this anaphylaxis chart though, I would argue that that belongs in the guidance because that to me,

133
00:51:21,254 --> 00:51:37,049
When people are doing their job on a regular basis, they are going to go to the guidance because that is where their immediate information need is going to be fed. Like, to me, that's the document that lives. So I think.

134
00:51:37,758 --> 00:51:57,147
The top part makes sense in the policy, because I think the policy needs to have some context. But then, perhaps, as we get down, that top part should be repeated in the guidance. And then this should move to the guidance, because that is where people are going to go when they are trying to use things.

135
00:51:58,463 --> 00:52:19,810
I'm also not sure we can put graphics, by the way, in our policy service. So I guess the only piece that I see that's worth keeping this, and I can take it out of graphic form and just put it into a word form, but is that this continues with the education, right? Like I said, I don't think people know that these are symptoms of anaphylaxis.

136
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:45,562
I think it's important that we keep the educational piece in here. If we're going to keep the other educational pieces in here, I've never given an EpiPen for a respiratory emergency. It's always been something else on this list. And I would probably guess that most non-nursing staff and non-allergy parents would not realize that a kid was having anaphylaxis with some of these symptoms.

137
00:52:46,203 --> 00:53:09,322
And I would say, again, I'm sorry, I don't want to be repetitive, but I do think tables and visuals are just going to aid in understanding and comprehension for a varied audience. Yeah, I mean, I like the visual. I think the visual is super important, which is why it belongs in guidance. Paul, I think you're right. We're going to find out that none of these graphics can go in the policy document.

138
00:53:09,828 --> 00:53:35,512
I will find out. Because it's like from straight out of 1985. Oh, yes, it is. I mean, obviously some of this is going to overlap too. So if we took the graphics out and just put the wording, although I do love the graphics, but if it can't be in the policy, let the graphics and the wording be in the guidance where at least the wording is in the policy. Yeah. Because I think the graphic is awesome.

139
00:53:35,933 --> 00:54:04,233
I do too. Yeah, yeah, for sure. OK. So considerations is working with students and caregivers. This is more background. I don't have any problem with this. I don't know what other people think. I think it belongs in the guidance because I think this is going to change and evolve, right? Like these are the considerations right now, but we may see that something else becomes

140
00:54:04,942 --> 00:54:31,300
useful in the evolution of how do we work with students and caregivers, right? Anybody? Jen? I'm a little torn. I mean, I agree that, yes, things can change when working with students and caregivers, but I think this is a pretty basic about psychological well-being. What's the policy? Like, what's the policy aspect of that statement?

141
00:54:33,140 --> 00:55:02,435
Yeah, I guess that makes sense, because I guess there is no specific policy piece to it. Yeah, I think that what I would like to see is some of this brought into the policy statement, like the why are we here? And I think that that's why I mean, a lot of most of our policies don't have policy statements, but I think they're important to be like, you know, none of us work in the district in the future. And we come to this thing and we're like, well, why is this thing even here?

142
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:27,123
Although in this particular situation, I don't imagine that allergies will be a thing of the past anytime soon. So, okay. So, allergy bullying, absolutely. We need to keep that. Universal life, universal precautions. I don't think that this should stay because this would be the basis for what we're going to kind of do all of

143
00:55:27,983 --> 00:55:50,107
what all the rest of the pieces and the guidance are gonna be on. So this is talking about that we have to wash, that we can't use hand sanitizer, we're cleaning surfaces before and after eating so we can prevent cross-contamination. So this to me is like the meat of like what we're asking everybody to do as policy. Yeah, I'm fine, it's short.

144
00:55:51,642 --> 00:56:21,173
Allergy medications in the school setting, I think we want the details here to be in guidance. I think we probably, well... Isn't there actual policy around allergy medication? Like students... We're doing the medication policy next, Jenny. There's a whole new regulation around it.

145
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:48,308
So then does it belong? Yeah, I think we can take it out. Yeah, I think we can take it out completely. Okay. I think it should still be in the guidance because I think people need to know what the medication is specific to allergies, but we're gonna be looking at the policy for medications very soon. Yeah, and I think in an evolving way, the guidance could include medication

146
00:56:49,118 --> 00:57:00,492
as another piece of the guidance that we're providing around health services, right?

147
00:57:12,895 --> 00:57:37,972
like that blah blah. I don't remember what I meant. So this section here I think like as a title yes and then a statement that you know are we working at this statement that actually says that this will exist and there'll be a reference to those things and then as we develop and work through our

148
00:57:38,933 --> 00:58:08,701
collected bargaining agreements. These things can be updated to be accurate. And what we expect. And I think this was. This is obviously super important stuff. I'm also wondering though, let me go back to the top of this. I think that we probably want to have like a section title related to. PTOs that then just points to guidance. Also, I feel like the PTOs is like

149
00:58:09,916 --> 00:58:38,097
one of those ones that's like a heavy hitter for the need for the policy and, um, or maybe it's actually not PTOs. It's, um, what did we call those, Jenny, when we did that policy on, um, booster organizations? Yeah. Well, I think we, I think we called them all the things that they are like it was PTOs. Yeah. All the things.

150
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:54,179
I think inserting a thing about these kinds of organizations need to go to this guidance and then having it, you know, kind of tailored to them.

151
00:58:54,533 --> 00:59:19,930
I think the other thing when we start talking about the guidance, I think we do need to send it out again explicitly and ask for people to provide written comment and ask us their questions. Because I think what we're going to get from them are the practical scenarios that are on their mind. Like, can I do this? Can I not do this?

152
00:59:20,572 --> 00:59:48,668
How do I do this? Are you saying I don't do this or how do I do that? Right. And I think that will give us like a really like rich bank to work from in terms of like, how do we help operationalize these things so that we see that higher success rate and that higher compliance rate. Yeah. Yeah. And again, that's an example where guidance is

153
00:59:50,103 --> 01:00:11,770
as great as all of us are in this room with our experiences, the day after guidance is published, somebody will be like, well, what about, and that can't be a whole nother round of policy updates, because that's a few months. All right, let's see.

154
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:47,596
Hey, I don't remember this section very much. How long is it? Oh, it's kind of long. So this feels like guidance to me. And maybe there are some like, maybe there are some policy related things that sort of like, float up out of this. But

155
01:00:50,549 --> 01:01:19,608
This is a procedure, so to me it belongs with the guidance, right? Like this is what we will do when this happens. Yeah, procedures should not be in here. Yeah. For sure. Janine? Janine? Can you unmute? Let me. There you are. Oh, shoot. There we go. I switched to my laptop, and now I can't do it.

156
01:01:19,827 --> 01:01:41,073
My video won't go on. I do want to make sure that there are some policy things that are retained in the rules and responsibilities. And I know that we'll be going over that. But things like there are teachers at the elementary level who are still handing out candy as prizes.

157
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:59,686
This cannot be happening. There needs to be policies about using food in the curriculum and how far in advance families need to be notified if there is a reasonable reason for that thing to be happening and how their child is going to be included.

158
01:02:01,627 --> 01:02:22,720
And I understand that there are differences between the primary and secondary educational levels and kids' own ability to manage their own allergies. But I think that there are some pieces of the role-specific thing that need to be policy and not just guidance, that it's very clear that we should not be serving food.

159
01:02:22,957 --> 01:02:50,378
And then Rhetta can speak to this too, because there's also the whatever competitive bidding, I don't remember what it's called, Rhetta, that food can't be served during school hours that's not, hasn't gone through food services, those kinds of things. But just things that are happening right now in our system that aren't really covered in the existing outdated policy that we wanted to make sure we're covered that shouldn't just go to the guidance, but should be very clear policy.

160
01:02:51,222 --> 01:03:06,055
Yeah, I would agree with that. I mean, I think the like, when my kids were in elementary school, they were always excited to take MCAS, because they could bring Jolly Ranchers to school. And I was like,

161
01:03:06,595 --> 01:03:31,621
I don't know why you're excited about this. Like, you never, ever eat Jolly Ranchers. Okay. And I guess the other question is like, that's maybe an example of where you would like, just want to say no to that thing. But given that every classroom, especially at the elementary level is potentially going to have something different going on.

162
01:03:32,836 --> 01:04:00,865
what are the things that we're like, no, just no completely. And what are the things that are like, there are a set of steps that you go through to understand like what the parameters in your room are. I don't know what they are. Um, but maybe you have a, maybe you have a room where there are no allergies at all. Like maybe that's true. And what does that, does that change how you operate in that room?

163
01:04:01,085 --> 01:04:31,004
versus everybody else. And I'm not saying you should or shouldn't do something different, but I'm just saying that those are the kinds of things where we just want to, I think we want to be thoughtful about what we're asking people to do to respond to like the facts that are sort of in their dynamic. Greta? Yeah, I just want to, I don't think a teacher should be giving out candy,

164
01:04:31,426 --> 01:04:57,616
to kids ever, and I feel like there is a policy somewhere that relates to this. I think it's a different story if a teacher says, oh, MCAS, you can bring in candy, or I know sometimes kids are allowed to bring in gum, and if they bring it in for themselves and are allowed to consume it, that's very different than someone giving it to them when a parent is unaware. Yeah.

165
01:04:58,949 --> 01:05:25,207
And I think even if, whether or not the kids have allergies in the classroom, that doesn't change that. There are just some things that should be a policy and shouldn't be done. And like I said, I believe that that was already written somewhere, but I don't know in what policy. Maybe it's competitive foods. I mean, it certainly doesn't meet the nutrition standards of competitive foods. So from that standpoint, it doesn't. But when you say no candy, like,

166
01:05:25,848 --> 01:05:51,565
we have to be clear about what we mean by that. We may not hand out candy versus you may never bring candy into the classroom. Those are two different things, right? So I think that's a good example of what are we specifically saying you can do and you can't do so that the policy can be clear about that. Teachers may not hand out candy. That's a policy. Fine. Good.

167
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:57,202
Moving on from that, but what does that mean? You know, what are the other layers there?

168
01:05:58,518 --> 01:06:28,505
Jen, did you want to say something? Because I can go after you. Yeah, sure. So one, I think the previous policy, or I don't know if it was ever approved by the school committee, but the policy that we're working on from 2007 says no outside food in the classroom. We know that that's no longer really possible to enforce. And I want to echo Rhonda that I think it needs to be more that we are not giving students food, that we can have special celebrations where we're having a movie day, and you can bring your own special snack, or it's MCAS, and you want to bring a piece of gum to chew after or Jolly Ranchers or whatnot.

169
01:06:28,505 --> 01:06:45,818
But I think we have to make it clear that there's no sharing or providing of food by our staff for students. The other thing I wanted to say is I think we can never assume there's no allergies in a classroom. There have been more EpiPens given for accidental exposure to unknown allergies.

170
01:06:45,818 --> 01:07:14,422
And actually, especially at the secondary level, there has actually been evidence and data that shows that there are more EpiPens given at the secondary level in high school for accidental exposure than at the lower level, because we're just so much more careful about it at the elementary level. And then we get this sort of laissez-faire at the secondary, like, oh, kids know their allergies. They're going to tell us. And that's not what's happening. So I just want to be very careful to say that, like, oh, you have allergies in your room. You don't have to worry about that. Everybody should be, we should be implementing the same policy.

171
01:07:14,422 --> 01:07:38,401
across the board, whether or not you know that students in your class have allergies. And I think that's very important that when we're looking at this and stating what is policy, that we make sure that it's clear across the board that no matter what's in your classroom, that this is an expectation. And it's not just food. So kids with gluten can't do paper mache. There's other pieces to this that don't include food.

172
01:07:41,472 --> 01:07:56,407
Oh my gosh, paper mache. Sorry, that just hit me. Or the egg drop, the science egg drop. Every time they say they're going to do the egg drop, my head like explodes. So much. You know how many kids have egg drops? Geez. Sorry, I hate all the rules.

173
01:07:57,115 --> 01:08:25,617
Nicole, member Brantley, you said that you were a para and they were always looking at allergens and stuff. I know students who have been handed allergen candies by special education classes in this district. It's not equally implemented. Oh, that might very well be the case. I'm just saying what I experienced in my classroom. Yeah, no, I just wanted to make sure that everybody knew that that's great. I'm so glad that that was happening in your classroom. That's not what's happening everywhere.

174
01:08:25,972 --> 01:08:44,922
Yeah, and even to Jen's point too, just one sec, Dr. Ghosi, like I remember even being as a para and they should be, you know, when we did have like a movie day before holiday break or winter break, you know, we would have like the popcorn time, you know, popcorn day, whatever, but we would talk,

175
01:08:44,922 --> 01:09:13,238
to each family, we would have them sign a little something, you know, and that was always approved by the principal, you know, but I'm not sure we went by any specific policy either. So, you know, I think that we do have to make sure that we're following something here, you know, that everybody's gonna do universally. Now, if they're following through with it, that's another story, you know what I mean? But... And I agree to all of the above.

176
01:09:13,745 --> 01:09:33,623
I think we have to be aligned. There has to be something we're all following so that everybody is doing the same thing. I agree with Karen's chat comments about it is, you know, on us to be modeling those expectations. I also just want to put two points, though, is that I do think that

177
01:09:34,484 --> 01:09:55,257
When we're just making a blanket statement about, you know, teachers aren't doing this and students shouldn't have candy, there does, though, need to be some sort of asterisk because there are students, for medical reasons, that have to receive candy. I would have to look a little bit more into Shanine's comment about

178
01:09:55,257 --> 01:10:18,578
special education, then this is not the platform to have that conversation. But there are some students where that is part of their IEP. I'm not saying what kinds of can be, but I'm just saying there has to be some sort of asterisk around, you know, with the exception of 504, a health plan, an IEP. And then

179
01:10:19,844 --> 01:10:45,106
There is that flip side. I understand what we're talking about with MCAS and making it like from home so that there's some parental oversight and permission, but that's also not the most equitable way to go about it. So I would rather have a conversation that's different around what that might look like, because then you're,

180
01:10:46,895 --> 01:11:12,308
you're not having all students that are gonna come to class with like a special reward or treat or, you know, to my knowledge, MCAS was lifesavers. It was not Jolly Ranchers and not candy, but I just wanna not close the door to that completely because then we're gonna get into an equity issue. Sounds like you think we should stop MCAS.

181
01:11:14,367 --> 01:11:31,833
Well, I think that's like a great example of like this. If you want to do it really well, it's much more complicated than just saying no to things because maybe the answer is.

182
01:11:32,947 --> 01:12:00,740
We as a district are going to provide X and we are asking for your permission for your kid to have this thing. I don't know, but I think that's a great example of like, I don't wanna like, you know, sort of throw it all out with the best of intentions. And then we actually are creating another problem that

183
01:12:01,955 --> 01:12:30,119
has to be solved from an equity perspective, right? Yeah, I'll let you speak in just a second, Jen. But there's that alternative to site-wide restrictions section that I think is really important. And I'm glad to see that in there, that if we just come out and say, there shall be no candy in Medford Public Schools, we all need to get a grip because that's just not

184
01:12:31,705 --> 01:12:56,039
At least it's just never going to happen. So, and I think that's part of the other issue with policy versus guidance is both policy and guidance. Don't need anything if it's not implemented. And I, the thing that I like about policy over guidance is that it outlives the employees.

185
01:12:57,406 --> 01:13:25,537
And that guidance should outlive the employees, too. But, you know, we'll do a new website someday and all the pages won't get converted and, you know, things vanish and it's a Google Doc and it was attached to Rob's account and Rob retires and suddenly all those Google Docs disappear. It's like the technical reasons for which things that are digital vanish is staggering.

186
01:13:25,537 --> 01:13:48,048
at least our policies do stick around. But again, we have hundreds of policies that have stuck around, which aren't even legal anymore. There's just nobody who should be following some of those. And my camera is not happy right now. But anyways, Jen, did you want to say something? No. Okay.

187
01:13:48,470 --> 01:14:11,015
We have 15 minutes, so I want us to get through the list of sections to get looked at again. Let me go back to where I was.

188
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:34,117
That to me feels very much like something. We're going to have changes in structures. We'll have some horrible economic situation and we'll start sharing principles. All kinds of horrible things can happen. That happened in Medford. We used to have principles covering more than one building.

189
01:14:34,117 --> 01:15:00,307
which I can't fathom how that was operationalized. But anyways, and we didn't even have assistant principals at all the schools when I started. So these are all things that I think are subject to need to really be robust and need to change as things change on the ground.

190
01:15:02,298 --> 01:15:08,930
The glossary 100% think that needs to stay here. There was.

191
01:15:10,803 --> 01:15:36,807
So we didn't have really the IT infrastructure, and I'm not really sure how much we have now, but I think I wrote a policy that was adopted that said we would actually have a master glossary website, just a URL, and that the committee, through our policy work, would be just adding them on so that 504 plans, as defined here,

192
01:15:37,280 --> 01:16:02,879
Anybody wanna take bets as to whether it's defined in 15 other policies and has a different definition? I mean, there's no point. We know that these definitions are repeated all over the place, and they're not necessarily in agreement. And sometimes it doesn't matter if they're not in agreement. Caregivers, some will say parents and guardians, like some of that stuff is irrelevant. But when it does matter,

193
01:16:03,014 --> 01:16:33,001
is I think when it really is a problem. I assume the American Academy of Pediatrics isn't gonna change their name soon, but Allergen Anaphylaxis Emergency Plan could get a nice new, shorter, friendlier name in the future. And anyways, I don't need to keep explaining myself. So hopefully we can get an actual glossary webpage and we can get all the terms that we are using in the district onto one dictionary and then just point to that.

194
01:16:33,001 --> 01:16:59,242
But for now, I actually think they should stay here until we have that. Anybody disagree? Okay. Alternatives. I actually like this section. Until I read it, I was like, oh, really? Maybe not all of the pieces.

195
01:17:02,566 --> 01:17:22,040
I think these strategies to me, like, in general, these strategies belong in guidance, I think, but again, there may be some things that we want to frame in the policy around. Like, when we're going to use site wide restrictions.

196
01:17:23,255 --> 01:17:50,896
I don't know, whatever those might be, and sort of point to the guidance for that evolving list, because I think this is going to change. Like, when we get a new high school and we don't have CAF 1, CAF 2, and CAF 3 anymore, like, I don't know, maybe that changes how operationally these things can be executed, or when the kitchen is completely different, or we change how we deliver food to the schools, whatever it is.

197
01:17:51,773 --> 01:18:11,129
All of those things sort of need to be updated and maintained. So to me, they rely on guidance. But I could see that there might be some site-wide restrictions, like schools may not have allergy tables in their cafeterias.

198
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:26,722
Right? Like, maybe that's a site wide restriction. Like, we're going to do that. We're going to do it in every building and that's the end of it. So that there are some things that belong in policy from these lists. Yeah, that that makes sense to me. I think.

199
01:18:28,173 --> 01:18:51,747
Yeah, I don't think I'm going to take chunks. I'm going to item by item go. Yeah, this is policy like this. This is this isn't policy. This is background. Whether or not it stays or not. But like the policy statement might be. You know district wide restrictions.

200
01:18:54,312 --> 01:19:03,661
Well, I don't know, but we can figure out where. We don't want to lose it because it's super important information, I think. Yeah.

201
01:19:06,142 --> 01:19:33,226
I just want to say, you know, we've been kind of using allergy tables as shorthand for like a policy that might stick, but the policy doesn't actually say we shouldn't ever have allergy tables. It says we should be working in partnership around a particular like set of needs to decide if that's relevant for like, so like a peanut free table is helpful for a particular group of kids. But if my peanut allergic kid goes and sits at the peanut table and somebody has hummus, he's going to have a reaction to that.

202
01:19:33,226 --> 01:20:03,044
So they're not as helpful as we want them to be, but the policy doesn't say we shouldn't have them. But I think that potentially, under the cafeteria strategies, the policy, instead of just the recommendation or the guidance, might be that first indented one where it says implementing allergy tables can be complex, but the need for designated tables will be determined for each individual school in consultation with these other parties. That could be the policy statement.

203
01:20:05,069 --> 01:20:22,906
Who gets to decide? I think that to me, not building to build clear. Yeah, but isn't that what I think? But I guess what seems to be what seems to have happened is that each individual building has decided without talking to central admin.

204
01:20:23,615 --> 01:20:53,298
just have different policies. I know the Missittook is doing a very different thing than the Roberts, and I don't know what the Brooks and McLennan are doing, but it seems like they've just been able to kind of make their own decisions on style rather than on best practice. And so I think the communication with central, with health services and the food services director would be part of the policy is that we make this decision together. And so if there is going to be a building difference that central should know about that.

205
01:20:54,698 --> 01:20:59,997
I also think we say in collaboration with caregivers there too, because so.

206
01:21:00,571 --> 01:21:28,229
I think you always have to plan for, in nursing we always are like planning for the unexpected, planning for the worst possible thing, right? And so we need to be able to say we're gonna do this in conjunction with caregivers and support from the central office because it may be that for one particular child who has multiple allergies, they need a specific setup versus at another school where there's a child that really only has this one thing we're worried about and so what are we doing for that one child?

207
01:21:28,229 --> 01:21:49,660
I think it's hard to say we can have, we always go back to the peanut table because those have become kind of a thing of the past. Because when we would say, oh, we're going to have a peanut free table, those kids were then being excluded from the rest of their group, right? Because if we're saying, oh, only the kids who are peanut free have to sit here, then we're not being inclusive.

208
01:21:49,660 --> 01:22:18,449
Whereas before saying, oh, the kids who bring peanuts can sit here, because now we're saying, well, we've made a choice. We're going to bring peanuts. We're going to sit at this table. Though I go back and forth about those two. But I think we just, so, but what I wanted to say before I have Shanine said that was, I think that what we can do is when we look at that universal section up near the top, we can pull out some of these things to be in that sort of like universal section. Like this is something that everybody should be doing. We can, you know, rename it, that it's not universal precautions, but yeah.

209
01:22:18,668 --> 01:22:34,582
You know, that we, I will totally admit that you have just shocked me by saying, we're not going to have the same thing in every cafeteria. Like, I. I am, like, a little bit flabbergasted, like, because I thought that's where we were going, but.

210
01:22:35,695 --> 01:23:02,206
Are you saying though that every school is required to have a cafeteria operations plan that takes into account what has to happen in their cafeteria and that that cafeteria operations plan has to be signed off by certain people? Is that the policy that, because I feel like what you've just said is it depends and it can be different, but I feel like I also heard a say,

211
01:23:02,543 --> 01:23:28,058
It's different and there's no reason why. So I'm trying to reconcile those things into something that is actually actionable. Yeah. So I think what we're looking at here, and I think obviously we spent a lot of this time talking about we want to make sure that all classrooms are doing certain things. So we're looking at now the difference of the cafeteria versus the classrooms is the cafeteria is where food has to happen, right? This is where kids eat. We have to look at what are our possible different options. So I do agree.

212
01:23:28,345 --> 01:23:51,042
kind of what you're saying with that cafeteria operations plan. Yes, we do have to have, in some way, what should the cafeteria staff, what should food services and health services be collaborating with the principal on to say, this is what this cafeteria has to look like based on our student population. So this is like the one time where there is going to be a little bit of wiggle room, because Johnny at this school is allergic to fava beans, and that's going to be an issue.

213
01:23:51,515 --> 01:24:11,596
you know, this kid at this school is allergic to something else and that's going to be an issue. So we have to, the cafeteria is where there has to be a little bit more collaboration to say we might have to do things differently in different schools. But I think what we're trying to say is we don't want it to be that there's this sort of specific table where only these kids can sit. We really need to have a conversation around that and make a plan.

214
01:24:12,457 --> 01:24:37,988
And it's about the safety, right, but also about the social emotional well-being inclusion part. So it is all individualized. Just like Jen said, it's not just about peanuts or nuts and providing that child with a safe, a safe spot while they're eating their food. Um,

215
01:24:40,756 --> 01:25:06,862
And I can. Hi, Karen. And I think. What I foresee in a cafeteria is all of those things are happening everywhere all at once at all times in the cafeteria, like the social emotional needs, the allergies, the not allergies, all of that is happening at the same time. So I think it's.

216
01:25:07,452 --> 01:25:31,330
Like, I appreciate the desire for us to say we have to, like, do what the kids need us to do. But I think on a practical level, the cafeteria is going to have kids that need us to do each and every single 1 of those things at the same time, which are potentially in conflict. Right? So how do we how do we frame the policy so that.

217
01:25:33,811 --> 01:25:56,896
I think what we're trying to do is have some consistency. So how do we frame the rules, the policy, so that we get consistency? And if I was the building principal, I would be like, I thought I had to have

218
01:25:58,482 --> 01:26:27,727
Allergen tables. I thought I had to have tables where people with peanuts go. I used to have tables where kids without peanuts went and I was told that was bad. So we switched to this. And now you're saying to switch back. Like, I think that's really hard to execute on. So that's, and I don't have the answers necessarily, but I think we have to come up with a framework for people so that they can put together plans that are

219
01:26:28,756 --> 01:26:57,511
consistent in some way. Paul, can you bring back up the cafeteria strategies? Because I think that we tried to frame it in that way in what we wrote. And again, I think that, yes, again, we have to parse out here what's policy and what's just guidance. But really looking at the basic piece here is that we're fostering an inclusive environment.

220
01:26:57,967 --> 01:27:23,245
So how do we do that? That's going to maybe look a little different in each place. And some of you may be way better at that language than I am. But just looking at what does that language actually look like when it comes to policy. Yeah, we can work on that. Yeah. Is best practice then that everything is individualized? I guess my only

221
01:27:24,477 --> 01:27:52,169
piece and I see where this would require setting up a communication structure so that all principals are following this, working, we have to be very clear about who we're working with and how we're creating this plan. Because the things that concern me are like the, especially like that K1 lunch. So we're there, and Shanine mentioned it, because there's so many allergies. So just to say that,

222
01:27:53,030 --> 01:28:22,780
a plan for one student, I don't know if we can always control what that student's peers are bringing in for lunch. I know that the classroom environments are very much controlled. And so there's lots of classrooms around the district that have, it may be a sesame-free classroom, it may be a nut-free classroom, and the cafeteria has been usually like a little bit

223
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:47,198
That has somewhat been a space where maybe families that are planning for their own children's lunch, they may know that you can't have this for snack because that happens in the classroom, but your child may be able to eat this because it's in the cafeteria. So I just want to make sure

224
01:28:47,198 --> 01:29:06,824
I know what is best practice for when we are trying to work around cafeteria planning. Does that make sense? Yeah. And I think best practice is that we have to individualize to an extent. And this is a little bit outside of policy, so I don't want to talk about it too much. But one of the things that we have been trying to do from health services

225
01:29:06,824 --> 01:29:33,352
is this Be a Pal education program with students as well. So that students are aware of food allergies, that they're getting more education about their peers, what could be happening in the cafeteria, what could be happening in the classroom. And so when we're looking at sort of what's going to be policy, I think on the procedure side, we have to look at bringing that Be a Pal program in as well, which has gone really well. The Mr. Tuck, the Roberts is implementing it this year. And, you know, just that there's more education all around. It's not just about the adults, it's about the students as well.

226
01:29:37,958 --> 01:29:50,159
We are here. We're at time. We should just do this last section here. Thoughts on this section here.

227
01:29:50,767 --> 01:30:10,392
Policy, I don't remember where it says this, but since we experienced this, it needs to be policy that school personnel cannot recommend that a child should not have a 504 for this, that they can take care of it with their medical plan.

228
01:30:12,299 --> 01:30:39,367
Yeah, I think we just have to be clear that the medical plan that is for emergencies or for use in the health services department is not the same as a 504 that's enforceable. And so unfortunately, we've had this happen on many occasions where parents have been told, oh, you don't need a 504 because you have a health care plan. So I think I do agree that I think some of this is policy. We can look at this was from the FAM's recommendation from the food allergy research.

229
01:30:39,687 --> 01:31:07,902
I think is where this came from, Shanine, right? I think this was in the FAMS guidance. And the FAMS guidance was over 30 pages. So, you know, we got it a little bit shorter when we came here. But I think that's exactly where this came from. Well, that goes back to the education part though, because you can have an individualized healthcare plan as part of a 504 plan, but we can work on the educational part for our staff.

230
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:33,991
I do think there is a policy element to this, which is what is our policy about how we have families bring these things to us? I'm not being very clear because my brain is just about cooked for today.

231
01:31:34,801 --> 01:32:03,303
There should be something in the policy that can go in handbooks that says, if your child has a food allergy, here's the pathway for you. You have options, whatever those options might be. It might be a medical plan. It might be a 504, whatever those things are. And how do I begin to do? I'm sending my kid to school. I know they have a life-threatening allergy.

232
01:32:04,248 --> 01:32:26,978
Who do I call? What do I do? How does it work? Right? There's a piece of this education that has to be available to families on how to engage with us so that plans can be put in place expeditiously if needed. Like you said, Jen, I was not a child when I learned I had a life-threatening allergy because

233
01:32:27,434 --> 01:32:56,813
I didn't eat any fish or shellfish at all. And until I did, I had no idea. And so you do learn about allergies and they change over time, right? So where do we put the like reference? So certainly that maybe the policy statement is the district will maintain a webpage that talks about how to do this. But it does seem to me to like, if it lives in policy,

234
01:32:57,623 --> 01:33:21,907
It's fine, but parents don't go to the policy handbook to serve these kinds of needs. So maybe the policy is that there is a mechanism to do this within expedited turnaround time or something like that versus trying to net that out in the policy document. OK.

235
01:33:32,622 --> 01:33:52,535
Um, really quickly, this is not, um, because Paul, you might not be aware in your, um, looking at the policies that, um, and I know Jen is on top of this as well, but there's currently legislation going through, um, at the state level that would broaden the use and, um, kind of

236
01:33:53,986 --> 01:34:19,670
the the use and storage of epinephrine so that like police officers are able to have it and all these other people are able to have access that restaurants can have stock epinephrine so those laws also can help inform our policy as they are passed and they're they're likely to pass but they're very very exciting since we know that so many people who do have a reaction are was it was it like 10 percent or 25 percent Jen

237
01:34:19,670 --> 01:34:38,789
of people who have a reaction inside a school are not known. And sometimes it's the mailman who has a sort of anaphylactic reaction in the school when he's dropping something off. Yeah, I think, though, just to piggyback on that, that will become part of our medication policy and not necessarily this policy. OK. Yeah.

238
01:34:39,667 --> 01:34:57,385
And as soon as that, as soon as that comes down, anything we need, as soon as we can get this completed before this law is changed, I would really be annoyed if they happen like the week before we approve it. So I'm gonna make

239
01:34:58,516 --> 01:35:28,368
the motion to have the administration in collaboration with Chair Rousseau, myself, rework the policy proposal to move appropriate sections to guidance. Does that sound OK? That's the next step. Is there a second? OK. Sorry. I was like, yeah, let's do that. Second. OK.

240
01:35:30,933 --> 01:35:51,689
Member Brandley. Did we lose? Yes, I'm here. Oh, you are. Sorry. Good. Because I'm still sharing, which I should stop. I can't see everybody. Okay, great. Thank you. Member Rousseau, yes. And Member Graham. Yes. All right. So I think we have a good

241
01:35:52,617 --> 01:36:21,642
set up next steps with all the notes that I took in the document. I'm gonna also have to, I'll get ahold of Will to have him set up a page, sort of as a landing page for guidance, unless we already have one, so that we can put that right into the actual policy instead of saying, we'll get to it in the future, which I don't know about you, but I'm all, but I'm pretty busy. So let's get it done.

242
01:36:21,642 --> 01:36:47,073
And then obviously after we've reworked this, I'll schedule another one of these meetings and if we can cross our fingers, it'll be the last meeting. Not that I don't enjoy this, but we actually have to pass something. So any other final words from anybody? Is there a motion to adjourn? I can motion to adjourn.

243
01:36:55,173 --> 01:37:24,569
Member Brandly? Yes. Member Graham? Yes. Member Rousseau? Yes. I really appreciate this great conversation, everyone. I do think we're getting, we are getting somewhere. I know that it's been a very long time coming and Shanine is, I appreciate the pokes to be like, what are we talking about? And I, and you know, cause everything's always, there's so much always in our faces. It's fluid, yeah.

244
01:37:24,738 --> 01:37:39,183
It's really hard to stay focused too long on one thing before something else grabs our focus. So I appreciate it. Everybody have a wonderful evening. This meeting is adjourned. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Bye bye.
