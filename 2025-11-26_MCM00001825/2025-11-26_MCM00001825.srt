[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Nicole, your camera needs to be... Oh, there you go.

5
00:00:17,755 --> 00:00:21,096
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just the light.

6
00:00:21,876 --> 00:00:22,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

7
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,596
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

8
00:00:25,897 --> 00:00:27,157
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are recording.

19
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:59,113
[SPEAKER_01]: The agenda for today is to take up the motion to move the management of life-threatening allergies policy to the Rules and Policy Subcommittee as

20
00:01:59,993 --> 00:02:01,935
[SPEAKER_01]: amended to include staffing and policy.

21
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,337
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget the date.

22
00:02:04,397 --> 00:02:06,979
[SPEAKER_01]: This was, I think it was May when we did that.

23
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,703
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's 24 pages.

24
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:16,407
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me just- June 18th.

25
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:18,248
[SPEAKER_01]: June 18th, thank you.

26
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:20,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I need to take a roll call.

27
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me open up my mail and record that.

28
00:02:28,076 --> 00:02:29,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Grant.

29
00:02:29,918 --> 00:02:30,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Here.

30
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Bramley.

31
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:32,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Here.

32
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:34,900
[SPEAKER_01]: And Member Ruseau.

33
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:36,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Here.

34
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:37,622
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

35
00:02:37,762 --> 00:02:38,462
[SPEAKER_01]: All present.

36
00:02:38,602 --> 00:02:39,843
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a quorum.

37
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:50,828
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to start off with, if anybody has any specific parts of this that they wanna talk about, we can go to that.

38
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:57,930
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think reading a 24 page policy is gonna get us done in the next six months.

39
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,811
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually all on the agenda.

40
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:03,951
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully people have had a chance to read it.

41
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:08,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I will screen share when we get to that part, when people have something they wanna look at.

42
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:08,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have to,

43
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:11,954
[SPEAKER_01]: to the imagine if you will kind of approach.

44
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:21,179
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to welcome the superintendent, Mr. O'Leary, our new director of, I forgot the technical title of the department is.

45
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Athletics, is that right?

46
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just called department?

47
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:27,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I should know that.

48
00:03:27,803 --> 00:03:30,044
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, our director of nursing.

49
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:31,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

50
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And community schools.

51
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and community schools, right.

52
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,941
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it was longer than that.

53
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:37,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And our director of nursing, Ms.

54
00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:43,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Silva, and we also have our director of food services, Rhetta Smith.

55
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:49,990
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's everybody I should be acknowledging real quick.

56
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:55,254
[SPEAKER_01]: So does anybody want to start with any comments on this?

57
00:03:56,134 --> 00:03:57,775
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not our first rodeo on this.

58
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:03,080
[SPEAKER_10]: I just have a couple of questions.

59
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:14,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so when we talked about this back in June, we talked about wanting to.

60
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:29,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Engage some of the folks who are, I'll say, implicated in this policy who we don't particularly have direct control over, like the in particular Rob is here from an athletics perspective.

61
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,243
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's great.

62
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:35,629
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just curious if that has been done and what the feedback was.

63
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:44,536
[SPEAKER_08]: So I did send this to the PTO leaders.

64
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:46,897
[SPEAKER_08]: I have not heard back from really any of them.

65
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:58,383
[SPEAKER_08]: When we were developing this policy, though, we did speak to some PTO members who gave us feedback on what was here, which is why some of the items that are included here are included in the policy.

66
00:04:59,624 --> 00:05:00,844
[SPEAKER_10]: And what was their feedback?

67
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:05,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I feel like overall, like,

68
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:09,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Our PTOs are super interested in helping.

69
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:20,446
[SPEAKER_10]: But this, to me, my read of this is that we are substantially changing how PTOs are being asked to operate when it comes to food.

70
00:05:21,246 --> 00:05:23,328
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just curious what their reactions were.

71
00:05:24,168 --> 00:05:24,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

72
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:26,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Shanine, are you on the call?

73
00:05:26,929 --> 00:05:32,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think she had a little bit more feedback from PTOs than I did.

74
00:05:32,092 --> 00:05:32,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I am.

75
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,091
[SPEAKER_09]: just walking back from the skate park opening, so pardon.

76
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:46,133
[SPEAKER_09]: So we spoke at length with both Missituk and Roberts PTO.

77
00:05:46,153 --> 00:05:52,975
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, I guess I want to take a step back really quickly, and I will answer that question.

78
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:59,676
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want to start this meeting acknowledging that the reason we are here is because children can die.

79
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:02,437
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the reason we are doing this policy.

80
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:10,294
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a fear every time, go find the back, because I told you to, go.

81
00:06:13,616 --> 00:06:30,966
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a fear every time I send my child or any of us with children with life-threatening allergies, send our child to soccer practice or lunch in the cafeteria or a birthday party or any of that, that someone is going to make a mistake and we are going to get that call.

82
00:06:32,346 --> 00:06:33,467
[SPEAKER_09]: That is why we are here.

83
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,471
[SPEAKER_09]: And we want to make sure that it is easy.

84
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:42,034
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't think anything in this policy is an unreasonable expectation for anybody.

85
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:58,882
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just wanted to ground us, because I think that in June when we met, that part, that importance of why this policy needs to exist, and the reason we made the recommendations we did, is to keep children safe and included in their school communities.

86
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:00,623
[SPEAKER_09]: So as for the PTOs,

87
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Roberts and Misitoka.

88
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:32,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Misitoka already does a lot in terms of considering allergies and Roberts talked about there being a difference between when the PTOs are serving food as a fundraiser purpose, when the grown-ups are going to be buying food, and when they are serving food to children for some sort of special event.

89
00:07:34,751 --> 00:07:35,952
[SPEAKER_09]: and the importance of labeling.

90
00:07:36,632 --> 00:07:52,465
[SPEAKER_10]: And did we get any feedback from the middle schools or the high school?

91
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:58,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think the conversation changes over time, right?

92
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,452
[SPEAKER_10]: As someone with a life-threatening allergy myself,

93
00:08:03,387 --> 00:08:05,928
[SPEAKER_10]: 100% understand the need for the policy.

94
00:08:06,648 --> 00:08:24,553
[SPEAKER_10]: I just am trying to understand how we have engaged the people whose workflows, as they were, we're asking to change so that we can be useful and helpful to them as they do that.

95
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:30,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, unfortunately, we did not hear back from middle school and high school PTOs.

96
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:39,839
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do think that we are asking for a change, but to follow on what Shane said, I don't think any of it's really unreasonable.

97
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:46,967
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of it is going to just focus around, one, making sure that people are aware of food allergies, because I think that part of what

98
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:50,609
[SPEAKER_08]: This policy is attempting to do is just make sure people are more educated.

99
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:59,671
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there was just, for example, homecoming was last weekend and a kiddo came to the high school nursing office asking if there was going to be an option for kids who were gluten free.

100
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:03,252
[SPEAKER_08]: And at that moment in time, there were not any options for kids who were gluten free.

101
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,513
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the school nurse and the principal work together.

102
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,354
[SPEAKER_08]: to make sure that that would happen.

103
00:09:07,874 --> 00:09:15,437
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I guess what we're trying to say is, hey, like, we need people to be aware of these things that we do make sure that one, we're keeping kids safe, and that we're being inclusive.

104
00:09:15,457 --> 00:09:18,539
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think those are the two pieces that this is trying to accomplish.

105
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I think that's, like, actually a great example.

106
00:09:24,862 --> 00:09:25,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

107
00:09:25,122 --> 00:09:25,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Like,

108
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:32,572
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't have a food allergy yourself, and there's, by the way, a million versions of food allergies.

109
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:36,878
[SPEAKER_10]: So, even if you have 1, it doesn't mean you're particularly tuned into them all.

110
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:45,208
[SPEAKER_10]: And without the right support, the organizers of events.

111
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:51,303
[SPEAKER_10]: are doing their best and not intending really to cause a problem.

112
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:57,026
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's this scramble that happens when this comes up.

113
00:09:57,106 --> 00:10:08,531
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think one question, the reason that I am asking about their involvement is because I think we have to, for this policy to be successful, we have to figure out how to

114
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:27,375
[SPEAKER_10]: shift that conversation so that it is not happening at the last minute when people begin to feel excluded, when people are already sort of in like final prep mode, right?

115
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:32,376
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we're saying, drop everything about your day and help us solve this problem.

116
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:40,078
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think one question that I, the reason that I care so much about this is because I think if done right,

117
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,691
[SPEAKER_10]: we can be hugely assistive in this process.

118
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:50,514
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm curious what that looks like at different levels.

119
00:10:50,554 --> 00:10:57,557
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the conversation's completely different at elementary school than it is at high school for a whole variety of reasons.

120
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:04,280
[SPEAKER_10]: So I do want to hear their voices in this conversation, because I think that's super important.

121
00:11:06,521 --> 00:11:10,183
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing that struck me about this policy is that,

122
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:18,128
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot going on in this policy that I think is going to make it hard for us to get compliance against.

123
00:11:18,568 --> 00:11:19,568
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 22 pages.

124
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:26,531
[SPEAKER_10]: It does include roles and responsibilities, which are governed by labor contracts.

125
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:36,555
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not enough for us to put it in a policy and then expect that everybody will

126
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,821
[SPEAKER_10]: be able to do those things.

127
00:11:40,522 --> 00:11:43,224
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some tentacles there that we have to think through.

128
00:11:45,806 --> 00:12:07,022
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think overall, if there is a way for us to separate the policy from the education and the assistive pieces of this, I think all of those pieces will get much more use than this living in its current format, because I think the current format is

129
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:08,840
[SPEAKER_10]: hard to digest.

130
00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:13,527
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't think that's the intention.

131
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,630
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's intended to be very useful.

132
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:22,420
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it has to be parsed a little bit differently for that to really work in practice.

133
00:12:23,395 --> 00:12:23,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

134
00:12:23,915 --> 00:12:25,336
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, I mean, I do think that makes sense.

135
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:32,579
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the intention was, the way we tried to make it more user-friendly is that you are a teacher and you go directly to your section.

136
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,940
[SPEAKER_08]: You were an administrator, you go directly to your section.

137
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,741
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is why it's so long.

138
00:12:36,781 --> 00:12:40,343
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because we really tried to parse out, okay, who's responsible for what different things.

139
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:49,787
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do, and actually Rob and I had this conversation earlier today about needing to involve, you know, our collective bargaining and what are we looking at when we're looking at roles and responsibilities as well.

140
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:50,888
[SPEAKER_08]: So that totally makes sense.

141
00:12:52,128 --> 00:13:02,615
[SPEAKER_08]: I do think that we could reconvene our team who's worked on this to look at how do we parse out the policy and then have those roles and responsibilities as like separate appendices that are in here.

142
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:06,958
[SPEAKER_08]: If that would be a good way to do it, I'd be open to any thoughts.

143
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:09,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my thoughts on this are.

144
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:24,439
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just from a policy hygiene, my new favorite word around policy, is that, you know, we can have, and the way the structure of policies, there's like a national policy

145
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:42,148
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of like the old Dewey Decimal System, if you will, there's like a structure that makes no sense to anybody, but that there is one, is that we have like the top level policy, and then you have other policies that are just under it rather than part of the same policy.

146
00:13:42,928 --> 00:13:50,012
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I like about that is that you can really target, well, you can target

147
00:13:51,222 --> 00:13:59,849
[SPEAKER_01]: training, you can say building administrators, you really all need to know this and it's not 24 pages long as we all agree is too much.

148
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:09,336
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, there's so much that is in here that different people who are coming, the different audiences of this are just not interested in.

149
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:11,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, this isn't relevant to them.

150
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:19,304
[SPEAKER_01]: So by burying it there, we're asking an awful lot of people to

151
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:27,970
[SPEAKER_01]: to find it, get lucky and find it in the index of, you know, a whole page index.

152
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:42,097
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, breaking it up so that it is, meets the different audiences, but also the different purposes that multiple audience members might come to this.

153
00:14:42,677 --> 00:14:45,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Shanee?

154
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:52,041
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to push back a little bit on the length of it being so problematic because

155
00:14:53,453 --> 00:15:00,658
[SPEAKER_09]: part of the whole design was to make sure that if you that you could figure out without having to parse all the different roles, what is the role of this person?

156
00:15:00,718 --> 00:15:01,739
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the role of this person?

157
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:05,202
[SPEAKER_09]: And it repeats those things a lot, which is a lot of the length of it.

158
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:10,005
[SPEAKER_09]: But it actually should be easier to find like, I'm a para, what's the policy?

159
00:15:10,045 --> 00:15:21,654
[SPEAKER_09]: What's my responsibility versus what is my, my lead teachers responsibility versus the health director, all of those things that actually divides those roles in a way that's much clearer.

160
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:34,040
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do want to remind this group that we, all of these, even splitting out the roles was based on the recommendations of the best policies group at Food Allergy Research and Education and the CDC.

161
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:45,087
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I think about, but like a policy that's, here's the policy that is just pointers to the other sections, like the index.

162
00:15:48,730 --> 00:16:02,360
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to suggest that I'm lazy, but when I see a 24 page document I have to read, I don't just plop down, I have to figure out when do I have time to read 24 pages, even though I might only really need to read two.

163
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:08,422
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like when we get emails and they scroll and scroll and scroll.

164
00:16:08,682 --> 00:16:11,683
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get to that later, which often means we don't get to it.

165
00:16:12,484 --> 00:16:15,345
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think of that as just a time management problem.

166
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:17,165
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is an information overload.

167
00:16:17,285 --> 00:16:24,288
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, yeah, so that's just my thoughts.

168
00:16:24,388 --> 00:16:31,251
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we did take the bullying policy down from, I don't remember, dozens of pages down to

169
00:16:32,738 --> 00:16:35,939
[SPEAKER_01]: a number that we all agreed, there's no excuse for not having read it.

170
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:43,560
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that, I mean, some of the people who will be needing this are working three hours a day.

171
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:56,243
[SPEAKER_01]: So when are we expecting them to, I mean, I guess that's professional development and administrative management problem, not mine, but superintendent, I think you have something you wanna say.

172
00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:06,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Having been at multiple levels in the district, I think something like this is important to

173
00:17:08,584 --> 00:17:10,726
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure that we're providing information.

174
00:17:11,707 --> 00:17:21,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like food allergies is something that is constantly ever evolving, fluid, new allergies are coming on all the time.

175
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:34,185
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of conversation and discussion at every school building between the nursing office, caregivers, teachers, school leaders, and

176
00:17:36,407 --> 00:17:52,631
[SPEAKER_04]: every time there are like new allergies that are added to this list and then ways that you have to now think in order to prepare spaces and make students make sure that students are included and that those pieces are there on behalf of our students.

177
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:58,772
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the informational part and the discussion part is for sure needed

178
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:05,461
[SPEAKER_04]: um around food allergies, food allergy awareness, food allergy training.

179
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:11,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the only you know the piece that's like really resonating with me is that there because

180
00:18:13,535 --> 00:18:23,101
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, the way it's organized, I appreciate having all the different roles and responsibilities right there for our employees and for our community.

181
00:18:25,223 --> 00:18:35,550
[SPEAKER_04]: But we just have to do a level of communication that I think we haven't really done yet in terms of like having, getting people around a table and talking to them about what this means.

182
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,892
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's something that we can just like send out

183
00:18:39,372 --> 00:18:44,214
[SPEAKER_04]: and then expect that people are gonna like read it, and there's this like level of compliance.

184
00:18:44,974 --> 00:19:02,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, member Graham already mentioned the piece around a lot of these people are bargaining members that we really have to work through, but there's just a lot of, in my opinion, levels of conversation that we just have to have before I think we can proceed with

185
00:19:03,262 --> 00:19:04,783
[SPEAKER_04]: making this an official policy?

186
00:19:05,184 --> 00:19:07,566
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if the conversation is, is this a policy?

187
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this guidance?

188
00:19:10,248 --> 00:19:12,509
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just think we need to plan some conversations.

189
00:19:15,352 --> 00:19:23,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you hear me?

190
00:19:23,838 --> 00:19:24,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

191
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:25,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

192
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,141
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's, I think it's both.

193
00:19:27,261 --> 00:19:30,844
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there are clear policy statements in here like,

194
00:19:32,222 --> 00:19:39,128
[SPEAKER_10]: threats of harassment for students with food allergies will be taken seriously and dealt with in accordance with a reference to our bullying policy.

195
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:42,030
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a policy statement.

196
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:47,295
[SPEAKER_10]: An allergy table is not something we're going to do as a policy statement.

197
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:56,403
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think those things belong in a compressed format in terms of what we as a collective are and aren't going to do.

198
00:19:57,873 --> 00:20:00,534
[SPEAKER_10]: But the second part of it is the guidance.

199
00:20:00,874 --> 00:20:08,717
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do think it's super helpful for people to have guidance that like they can go to their part and understand what their part is.

200
00:20:09,637 --> 00:20:17,680
[SPEAKER_10]: And there should be one for coaches because coaches are gonna deal with like a kind of a different, like slice of all of this, right?

201
00:20:18,941 --> 00:20:21,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Then PTOs, then paras.

202
00:20:21,902 --> 00:20:25,483
[SPEAKER_10]: So that piece to me, like sort of like,

203
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:30,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Snaps out and becomes guidance like.

204
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,457
[SPEAKER_10]: This is our policy.

205
00:20:32,677 --> 00:20:35,682
[SPEAKER_10]: This is where you go for guidance and the guidance.

206
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:50,039
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like my preference would be that the maintenance of that guidance can reside with the director of nursing and not necessitate like a big policy review.

207
00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:57,301
[SPEAKER_10]: If something has to change, because I think what will happen in practice is things will evolve and change and we want to be responsive to them.

208
00:20:57,561 --> 00:21:00,442
[SPEAKER_10]: And as soon as your documentation is out of date, it is useless.

209
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:01,162
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

210
00:21:02,082 --> 00:21:12,130
[SPEAKER_10]: we can't, you know, if something needs to change because it was confusing or in practice, like somebody asked a question and we're like, that's a great point.

211
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:12,990
[SPEAKER_10]: We should include that.

212
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,272
[SPEAKER_10]: We should include that in the guidance for PTOs.

213
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:28,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever that may be, like being able to change it so that that guidance is applicable and resonates with the people it's intended to be supportive of is,

214
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,114
[SPEAKER_10]: to me, ideal.

215
00:21:31,454 --> 00:21:38,799
[SPEAKER_10]: And that doesn't happen in a policy that requires subcommittee and multiple readings.

216
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:43,342
[SPEAKER_10]: If something is needing to be changed in real time, I want it to be able to be changed in real time.

217
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:47,384
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think if we think about, to me, there's two pieces, policy and guidance.

218
00:21:48,205 --> 00:21:54,209
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's maybe some overlap of things that are not going to change in a really wily way.

219
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,691
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think

220
00:21:58,194 --> 00:22:03,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to get both pieces right and put the right things in the right bucket.

221
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:12,483
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't think it's necessarily that structurally the repetition is bad.

222
00:22:13,284 --> 00:22:18,607
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that repetition belongs in the guidance and not in the policy.

223
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:24,031
[SPEAKER_10]: But when I look at policy, actually, I was just talking to somebody about,

224
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:34,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Our policy and it was also very long and I said, you know, in summary, our policy is this and I said it in like, 2 and a half sentences.

225
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:36,628
[SPEAKER_10]: It was very long.

226
00:22:38,272 --> 00:22:41,075
[SPEAKER_10]: And it substantively was the same as two and a half sentences.

227
00:22:41,175 --> 00:22:47,100
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm always a fan of the policy being like really crisp and concise.

228
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,762
[SPEAKER_10]: So there can be no confusion.

229
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,503
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't do allergy tables.

230
00:22:51,024 --> 00:23:01,233
[SPEAKER_10]: We take bullying seriously, whatever those things are so that it's simple to know what we're expected to implement.

231
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,916
[SPEAKER_10]: The guidance then has to back it up.

232
00:23:05,056 --> 00:23:14,413
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think, to me, that's like there's two things happening in this document, and they both have to happen, but I don't think they should happen in the same document.

233
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:18,099
[SPEAKER_06]: God.

234
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:27,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so I just saw this this morning for the first time, but a couple of things that I can't agree with more that was just said almost so.

235
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:33,404
[SPEAKER_00]: But the biggest thing I think from athletic standpoint is I want more parents involved.

236
00:23:33,965 --> 00:23:35,286
[SPEAKER_00]: I want more people involved.

237
00:23:36,027 --> 00:23:42,989
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like the first line of a couple of things like team dinners, we have to have a menu set before that.

238
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:47,170
[SPEAKER_00]: That as an athletic director, as a coach, is going to be next to impossible.

239
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:52,031
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not a fan of putting policy in that we can't follow through with.

240
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:58,252
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a team dinner that we didn't even know about because the kids put it on or the parents put it on or something outside of the school.

241
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:01,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Jen and I talked about this this morning a little bit.

242
00:24:01,913 --> 00:24:06,114
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot different than something that's happening inside of the school or at somebody's house, right?

243
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:11,416
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the fact a lot of districts use like a letter that is sent out.

244
00:24:11,636 --> 00:24:21,520
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a little quick research after Jen and I met this afternoon that is sent out to like a team that says, doesn't tell you who, but somebody on the team has celiac disease.

245
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,241
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're planning a team dinner, please be aware of this, right?

246
00:24:25,281 --> 00:24:27,862
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we could get that information and then, you know,

247
00:24:28,422 --> 00:24:51,922
[SPEAKER_00]: foster it out through the nursing office or through my office, I guess me, is like, if we can get that information and then get it out to the teams, and it doesn't have to be a policy, but more of a guidance of like, you know, someone on the team has this allergy, or someone on the team has this allergy, and then we can hope that the parents follow through with that.

248
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:53,904
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I think that

249
00:24:55,605 --> 00:25:04,913
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest thing I saw in that was just the change of a job description for a coach.

250
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:18,545
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're making it a policy, as a former union president, I would say that we'd have to at least change our job descriptions and add it somewhere in the job postings when we're doing it that we want them to

251
00:25:19,345 --> 00:25:23,026
[SPEAKER_00]: take the allergy course and pass it, because right now they're not doing that.

252
00:25:23,866 --> 00:25:30,647
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're going to do that, we should probably add it in for the next season that we're going to post coaching positions.

253
00:25:30,707 --> 00:25:31,507
[SPEAKER_00]: We have concussions.

254
00:25:32,027 --> 00:25:35,728
[SPEAKER_00]: We have things that Jen and I talked about earlier, the concussion, the CPI, the first aid.

255
00:25:35,908 --> 00:25:44,610
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a major thing to add it, but we should add it if we're looking to get that done sooner rather than later.

256
00:25:45,865 --> 00:25:51,390
[SPEAKER_00]: But that team dinner thing is what jumped out at me right away, because sometimes we don't even know about a team dinner that happens.

257
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:11,678
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess my question, and this is, this is not my general sphere, but what's the difference in terms of enforceability between a guidance and a policy?

258
00:26:11,718 --> 00:26:17,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I mean, even just what Mr. O'Leary just said of hoping the parents follow through on that, like, team dinners are a prime

259
00:26:18,447 --> 00:26:20,869
[SPEAKER_09]: issue for kids having accidental reactions.

260
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:25,852
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just, what is the difference, Paul, between or?

261
00:26:25,872 --> 00:26:36,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the difference, there's no difference, both written policy of the school committee, as well as guidance that the superintendent essentially is issuing.

262
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:40,701
[SPEAKER_01]: In both cases, it's the superintendent who's responsible for endorsement.

263
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:45,745
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really falls to how the superintendent is willing to enforce

264
00:26:48,394 --> 00:26:58,682
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything that is not, so we don't have a life-threatening allergy policy today, but that isn't that we don't actually have, we don't have an official school committee policy.

265
00:26:59,222 --> 00:27:06,468
[SPEAKER_01]: But the district and the superintendent, what they say is policy unless we have overridden it.

266
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:28,995
[SPEAKER_01]: so everything that's missing from our policy manual is not that it's just a you know wild west it it's the up to the central administration and their their what they say is policy if the school committee has not spoken on it um which of course is totally the opposite of anything legislative in any other setting where until it's

267
00:27:29,835 --> 00:27:32,717
[SPEAKER_01]: the legislative body has said something, it doesn't exist.

268
00:27:34,217 --> 00:27:40,581
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's part of the 1993 Ed Reform Act that gave that kind of authority to superintendents.

269
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:49,486
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of it is just to principals too, which I find a little annoying that sometimes principals have authority that actually the superintendent doesn't have.

270
00:27:50,386 --> 00:27:52,007
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, we don't need to rehash that.

271
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:57,630
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that the team dinner is like a really good example of like,

272
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:15,910
[SPEAKER_10]: We can have a policy, but without the right support in place, a parent with good intentions could do something that causes harm, right?

273
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody's intending to do that.

274
00:28:21,142 --> 00:28:27,387
[SPEAKER_10]: But the question then becomes like, to Shanine's point about consequence, right?

275
00:28:27,447 --> 00:28:31,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, we can't consequence a parent.

276
00:28:32,428 --> 00:28:36,071
[SPEAKER_10]: who didn't provide an alternative, right?

277
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, what are we going to do, kick their kid off the team?

278
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:41,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, are we going to suspend the kid?

279
00:28:41,936 --> 00:28:47,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, we don't have, like, enforcement authority in those situations.

280
00:28:47,621 --> 00:28:53,165
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we have to do instead is make it exceedingly easy for people to be able to comply.

281
00:28:53,806 --> 00:28:56,028
[SPEAKER_10]: And so when you talk about team dinners,

282
00:28:57,325 --> 00:29:09,907
[SPEAKER_10]: It should be, I think, pretty simple for the coaches at the beginning of the season when they finalize their roster to collect the food allergies that are there.

283
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:17,249
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if there is a parent who is wanting to host a dinner, that list can be passed to them.

284
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:22,430
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not their responsibility to go ask all the kids

285
00:29:23,323 --> 00:29:24,424
[SPEAKER_10]: what their food allergies are.

286
00:29:24,544 --> 00:29:31,848
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the high school level, by the way, you're going to get more answers from the kids than you are from the parents.

287
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:38,992
[SPEAKER_10]: And only if the kids sort of decide to respond.

288
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:44,516
[SPEAKER_10]: And it doesn't mean they're not going to show up at your house like, surprise, I have this allergy.

289
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,457
[SPEAKER_10]: And now there's something happening.

290
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:51,240
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think there are some ways for us to engage

291
00:29:52,685 --> 00:29:58,871
[SPEAKER_10]: with some basic systems in place to be proactive.

292
00:29:58,951 --> 00:30:04,757
[SPEAKER_10]: And then at the beginning, when the coaches are having their meeting with parents, they're saying, we want to have team dinners.

293
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,059
[SPEAKER_10]: We encourage you to do that.

294
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:13,305
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're going to do that, here are some things that you need to know about our team so that we can keep everybody safe.

295
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:14,846
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it's not about like,

296
00:30:15,582 --> 00:30:19,484
[SPEAKER_10]: failure and consequences, which we really don't sort of have the authority to do.

297
00:30:20,044 --> 00:30:23,066
[SPEAKER_10]: But instead about, let me make this easy for you.

298
00:30:23,186 --> 00:30:25,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, Lucas wants to have a team dinner.

299
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:28,009
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, okay, we can do that.

300
00:30:28,469 --> 00:30:31,351
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you serve a bunch of teenage boys?

301
00:30:31,431 --> 00:30:33,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it seems like it would be very complicated.

302
00:30:33,612 --> 00:30:36,854
[SPEAKER_10]: And he said, Oh, he went to a team dinner and they serve lasagna.

303
00:30:36,914 --> 00:30:37,254
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like,

304
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,423
[SPEAKER_10]: wild that no one has celiacs.

305
00:30:39,543 --> 00:30:40,725
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that's true or not.

306
00:30:41,225 --> 00:30:41,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

307
00:30:42,046 --> 00:30:44,730
[SPEAKER_10]: But I was like, well, I'm glad everyone likes lasagna.

308
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,232
[SPEAKER_10]: And then he's like, well, there was a lot left over.

309
00:30:46,252 --> 00:30:47,994
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, maybe they didn't like lasagna.

310
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:49,115
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard to know, right?

311
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:51,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Like every the team changes all the time.

312
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,803
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think like as a parent, like,

313
00:30:55,376 --> 00:30:57,618
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to open up my home and do those things.

314
00:30:58,118 --> 00:31:05,123
[SPEAKER_10]: But it sure would be nice if somebody could hand me a little roadmap on how to do that and be successful, right?

315
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:13,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Both in a safety perspective and also, I'm not serving anyone shellfish in my house because that is my life-threatening allergy.

316
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:19,094
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's plenty of others that would happen that sort of evolve in my house.

317
00:31:19,134 --> 00:31:22,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I just realized I was eating a container of nuts while we were talking, ironically.

318
00:31:24,598 --> 00:31:34,542
[SPEAKER_10]: But it sure would be nice if it could just be a little bit easier for people to engage in those ways that we want them to, and it would keep everyone safe too, right?

319
00:31:34,582 --> 00:31:36,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, which is actually the point.

320
00:31:36,763 --> 00:31:45,867
[SPEAKER_10]: I think parents will as much appreciate the assistance in being able to, like, show up for their kids in these ways.

321
00:31:50,102 --> 00:31:52,784
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think I just have one question.

322
00:31:53,104 --> 00:32:02,151
[SPEAKER_05]: If we were to sever their part of their responsibilities, all of these boxes of what everybody is going to do, where do we put it and how do we enforce it?

323
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there really a way to enforce it?

324
00:32:05,094 --> 00:32:06,655
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, as it being guidance?

325
00:32:11,702 --> 00:32:12,462
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we don't.

326
00:32:12,883 --> 00:32:14,163
[SPEAKER_05]: We're kind of doing it now.

327
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:14,944
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what I mean?

328
00:32:14,964 --> 00:32:16,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not to this extent.

329
00:32:16,424 --> 00:32:17,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I was a para.

330
00:32:17,925 --> 00:32:24,468
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, that was always a topic of conversation, especially in the classroom day to day.

331
00:32:24,628 --> 00:32:29,550
[SPEAKER_05]: We we always I don't think there was ever a class that didn't have an allergy of some sort in there.

332
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:36,514
[SPEAKER_05]: And having snack, especially as kindergartners in the classroom, it was something that was, you know, the topic at all times.

333
00:32:36,574 --> 00:32:39,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I check snacks as a para just to make sure everybody was safe.

334
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:52,981
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, I guess to have some sort of guidance is great, because I think sometimes we do lack that with, you know, lots of different things, you know, like you kind of get put in a position and you're like, okay, this is what I'm doing now.

335
00:32:53,861 --> 00:33:02,525
[SPEAKER_05]: But how do we separate maybe these boxes of responsibilities for people without violating anything in the

336
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:05,084
[SPEAKER_05]: CBAs, right?

337
00:33:05,764 --> 00:33:12,626
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we incorporate all of this to be good guidance, but a really crisp policy on its own?

338
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:17,687
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, our muscle is the superintendent.

339
00:33:18,688 --> 00:33:19,908
[SPEAKER_01]: She is our enforcer.

340
00:33:21,088 --> 00:33:23,869
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope somebody does an AI version of that.

341
00:33:25,569 --> 00:33:32,191
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think what you would find in policies that would be something like the superintendent

342
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:46,061
[SPEAKER_01]: or designee, sorry, will create and maintain roles and responsibilities and annually ensure that all relevant staff

343
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:51,026
[SPEAKER_01]: are aware of those instead of specifying what those are.

344
00:33:51,046 --> 00:34:02,839
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that is, you know, when you think about like federal legislation, like that legislation almost always says some department will go off and figure out what we really meant.

345
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:08,229
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what most laws do not say actually what should happen.

346
00:34:08,249 --> 00:34:27,235
[SPEAKER_01]: They say somebody who's an expert will go off and write the regulations, CMF, the regulations that make sense because the legislators, and in this case, the school committee, even if we do have it, the problem is that, and remember Graham mentioned this earlier, is that

347
00:34:28,876 --> 00:34:34,663
[SPEAKER_01]: our ability to respond quickly to needs to changes in policy is limited.

348
00:34:34,683 --> 00:34:43,032
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just by the number of meetings we have and by the fact that we have 180 backlogged policies, we still need to update.

349
00:34:44,114 --> 00:34:46,657
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, I had been working to get this done since

350
00:34:48,098 --> 00:34:53,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony was the director, like we were communicating back then.

351
00:34:54,964 --> 00:35:01,168
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we at that time, we were also taking the, you know, throw it all in kitchen sink kind of approach.

352
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:07,373
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that in that time, we haven't had official school committee policy.

353
00:35:07,413 --> 00:35:15,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think part of that is because we were including too much and at this hands up.

354
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:16,921
[SPEAKER_01]: So who was next?

355
00:35:20,127 --> 00:35:20,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it was me.

356
00:35:21,528 --> 00:35:23,770
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, go ahead, Jen.

357
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:29,013
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to say, so clearly, we were trying to make this as easy as possible for people, right?

358
00:35:29,053 --> 00:35:31,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, that's part of why we broke it down into the roles and responsibilities.

359
00:35:32,856 --> 00:35:36,398
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely see the difference between having this policy and this guidance.

360
00:35:36,438 --> 00:35:41,482
[SPEAKER_08]: But to Nicole's point, like, right, like, yes, the superintendent can help us enforce.

361
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:45,665
[SPEAKER_08]: But a lot of this is stuff we're already doing, already asking of people to do that they're not doing.

362
00:35:46,557 --> 00:35:55,640
[SPEAKER_08]: So for example, when we're asking principals to not have allergy tables in their cafeterias, there are schools- And you have an implementation problem.

363
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:57,601
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have a policy problem, right?

364
00:35:58,061 --> 00:35:58,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

365
00:35:59,202 --> 00:35:59,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

366
00:36:00,775 --> 00:36:11,659
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and I think whether it's policy or guidance, it only works if you're going to roll it out and you're going to tell everybody what's expected of them.

367
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,681
[SPEAKER_10]: And until you do that, the compliance is not going to be there.

368
00:36:15,761 --> 00:36:20,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Not because people are being willful and ignoring.

369
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:33,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe maybe they are at the moment, but from a change management perspective, you have to tell people what you expect of them before you can expect to see change.

370
00:36:33,894 --> 00:36:40,360
[SPEAKER_10]: So, once we figure this out, there probably needs to be some professional development that is targeted so that.

371
00:36:42,021 --> 00:36:53,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Not just does everyone understand what the policy is, but they understand why so that they can get on the bus with the change and like, you know, carrot stick, we're going to use them all.

372
00:36:54,146 --> 00:36:59,168
[SPEAKER_10]: But, like, if people still have allergy tables, there needs to be some dialogue about why.

373
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:04,190
[SPEAKER_10]: And what help do they need to make the move in their building?

374
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the move is happening.

375
00:37:05,831 --> 00:37:08,773
[SPEAKER_10]: So tell us what you need, and then let's make that happen.

376
00:37:08,813 --> 00:37:10,054
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how you make change.

377
00:37:10,114 --> 00:37:14,337
[SPEAKER_10]: So once this is all said and done, there does have to be

378
00:37:15,878 --> 00:37:20,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, a relevel set, because there are people who've been in our buildings for, like, 25 years.

379
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,801
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like, I've been here for 25 years.

380
00:37:21,901 --> 00:37:23,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, I know about allergies.

381
00:37:23,981 --> 00:37:24,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, do you?

382
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:28,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe you thought you did, but you don't.

383
00:37:28,823 --> 00:37:32,285
[SPEAKER_10]: So we do have, like, that to me is about implementation.

384
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:41,953
[SPEAKER_10]: and having a thoughtful implementation plan that goes with this so that the coaches have a space to go and be like, Rob, this is just too much.

385
00:37:42,354 --> 00:37:44,015
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how I'm going to do this.

386
00:37:44,315 --> 00:37:56,887
[SPEAKER_10]: We need people to articulate those kinds of reactions and implementation because only once they do, can you then work that apart and actually help them be successful.

387
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:05,602
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's a little bit more complicated than just saying, do what I told you to do, if what you really want is compliance and results.

388
00:38:06,902 --> 00:38:08,282
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's incredibly painful.

389
00:38:09,043 --> 00:38:10,083
[SPEAKER_04]: And Rhetta has her hand up.

390
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:13,904
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want to like, jump, although I am jumping in front of her.

391
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:14,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Rhetta.

392
00:38:15,284 --> 00:38:22,426
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that just I just want to like, kind of punctuate what you just said member Graham only because that's the piece that I'm talking about.

393
00:38:22,986 --> 00:38:24,026
[SPEAKER_04]: When I mentioned that

394
00:38:25,765 --> 00:38:29,167
[SPEAKER_04]: we have to have explicit, intentional conversations.

395
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:32,089
[SPEAKER_04]: And to my knowledge, those haven't started yet.

396
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:39,615
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they, on a global level, that's going to meet all of these roles right here.

397
00:38:40,435 --> 00:38:48,461
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the piece that I think is where we need to go in the next, like as our next step to this.

398
00:38:48,481 --> 00:38:50,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't know

399
00:38:52,152 --> 00:38:59,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how it like explicit it's been or how many conversations have been with this specific roles that are like listed here.

400
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,101
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think Jen and I can do that.

401
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:07,265
[SPEAKER_01]: With Rhetta.

402
00:39:09,206 --> 00:39:09,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, go ahead.

403
00:39:10,488 --> 00:39:12,029
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

404
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:33,589
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to, I don't know if it's a point of clarification or just maybe I'm a little bit confused, but I thought that with this policy, really our intention in talking about PTOs and other activities was going to be things that were, you know, explicitly sponsored by the schools or part of the PTOs.

405
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:37,012
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jen has a thing, I don't know, substantive,

406
00:39:37,956 --> 00:39:53,662
[SPEAKER_07]: assistance or something that makes the PTOs kind of come under the authority of the school policies, rather than a parent who wants to invite all of the kids over on a team to have dinner.

407
00:39:53,702 --> 00:39:55,163
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if the

408
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:59,344
[SPEAKER_07]: a booster club is, you know, putting it on.

409
00:39:59,384 --> 00:40:01,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I know like the track dinners we did in the school.

410
00:40:01,586 --> 00:40:06,748
[SPEAKER_07]: So, of course, like we followed lots of rules with those meals that were being provided.

411
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:16,093
[SPEAKER_07]: And just trying to say that it's not like if anybody wants to try to feed kids outside of school hours, these rules do not apply to them.

412
00:40:16,193 --> 00:40:25,938
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think just in my experience, there are things that are being put on by the schools or the PTOs that,

413
00:40:26,345 --> 00:40:36,290
[SPEAKER_07]: aren't considering the needs of students who have food allergies, many of them who have 504s that explicitly say that accommodations will be made, but they're not.

414
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:41,332
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're just, it's not, it's not really something that's being considered.

415
00:40:43,653 --> 00:40:45,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for bringing that up.

416
00:40:45,294 --> 00:40:50,416
[SPEAKER_01]: This is sort of a question I don't, I don't know the answer to, but,

417
00:40:52,670 --> 00:41:10,017
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a team of 20 students, 20 athletes, and the coach, every time there's a change in the roster says, or at the beginning of the season, can I get a list of food allergies so that I can send this around to the parents?

418
00:41:12,538 --> 00:41:17,821
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just wondering about, and when there's 20, that's one thing.

419
00:41:18,121 --> 00:41:19,962
[SPEAKER_01]: What if it's a very small group?

420
00:41:21,663 --> 00:41:24,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, one kid joins and now there is a food allergy.

421
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:30,293
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we deal with the privacy related issues there?

422
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:36,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they are, what they aren't, and I'm just very curious about that.

423
00:41:38,732 --> 00:41:44,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Because obviously keeping people safe, it can't just be on us.

424
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:47,542
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like with the summer school stuff that we've offered.

425
00:41:47,562 --> 00:41:56,672
[SPEAKER_01]: If a kid's on an IEP and they don't want the summer camp folks that we have to know, well then that kid will go.

426
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:03,885
[SPEAKER_01]: the disabilities that the kid has will not be known by the staff, which is not ideal.

427
00:42:04,065 --> 00:42:11,712
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can't just hand over that kind of information, even to people that work for us in the summer program.

428
00:42:11,812 --> 00:42:14,634
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm curious about that.

429
00:42:14,714 --> 00:42:15,895
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jen, do you have an answer?

430
00:42:17,052 --> 00:42:21,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so we obviously can't provide lists of students matched to their food allergies.

431
00:42:21,793 --> 00:42:23,433
[SPEAKER_08]: We can provide general information.

432
00:42:24,094 --> 00:42:29,715
[SPEAKER_08]: But the other thing that we can do is ask parents to provide that information on sports registrations on club registration.

433
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:33,155
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is something that does really well with their after school clubs.

434
00:42:33,736 --> 00:42:36,536
[SPEAKER_08]: They ask for that information on the after school club registration.

435
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:39,857
[SPEAKER_08]: So that way, it's the parents providing that information directly to the after school.

436
00:42:40,317 --> 00:42:43,098
[SPEAKER_08]: club volunteers or, you know, because it's run by the PTO.

437
00:42:43,778 --> 00:42:46,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob and I actually talked about today that we can incorporate it into sports registration.

438
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:52,321
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is not that it's not on us, like the nurses sharing that information or the trainer.

439
00:42:52,741 --> 00:42:54,661
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the parents sharing that information directly.

440
00:42:54,681 --> 00:43:07,605
[SPEAKER_10]: And you could also just ask the parents to say, I am also authorizing that this can be shared with people on the team who may be involved in providing food.

441
00:43:07,845 --> 00:43:08,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

442
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:09,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I think you could also ask parents, like,

443
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:12,634
[SPEAKER_10]: at registration, which is like the perfect place to do it.

444
00:43:13,094 --> 00:43:19,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Because whether you're going to respond to the coach mid-season or not, like you do have to just do your kid.

445
00:43:20,156 --> 00:43:22,477
[SPEAKER_10]: So like that is the perfect place.

446
00:43:22,557 --> 00:43:34,140
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're willing, you know, and if you say, yes, my kid has an allergy and yes, you can tell people about it, then it's a real, it's a real easy thing for the coach to hand over the list to somebody who needs it.

447
00:43:35,481 --> 00:43:39,522
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also think like when you're talking about team dinners, you're usually talking about high school.

448
00:43:40,427 --> 00:43:47,756
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the time high school rolls around, food allergies are something kids are very accustomed to.

449
00:43:48,637 --> 00:43:51,461
[SPEAKER_10]: There's food allergies all around them all the time.

450
00:43:54,123 --> 00:43:56,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Kids talk.

451
00:43:56,423 --> 00:44:03,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Kids are going to talk about that stuff much more openly, I think, than if you were talking about much younger kids anyway.

452
00:44:03,085 --> 00:44:12,126
[SPEAKER_10]: So I tell everybody who needs to know about my life-threatening allergy, because it's like a defense mechanism, right?

453
00:44:12,226 --> 00:44:18,767
[SPEAKER_10]: It's how I keep myself safe when somebody puts shellfish stock in something that has nothing to do with shellfish.

454
00:44:19,267 --> 00:44:22,388
[SPEAKER_10]: So I do think that's a great.

455
00:44:24,207 --> 00:44:31,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Operational way to like, collect and distribute this information without putting the district in the middle of like.

456
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:36,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Privacy concerns, but we, we could also run that by our attorney.

457
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it all sounds operational, like it can be operationalized.

458
00:44:42,343 --> 00:44:45,024
[SPEAKER_01]: I had forgotten about registration forms.

459
00:44:45,344 --> 00:44:55,371
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just thinking like the coach sends a list to the nurse and the nurse writes a list back and that kind of made me nervous because then what does the coach do with the list, sends it out to parents.

460
00:44:56,251 --> 00:45:01,094
[SPEAKER_01]: That freaked me out a bit, but glad to see there's an alternative to that.

461
00:45:03,756 --> 00:45:06,878
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at the policy right now,

462
00:45:09,528 --> 00:45:24,789
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at the sections and what parts I think would be better as statements that the superintendent will create and maintain guidance.

463
00:45:26,203 --> 00:45:31,025
[SPEAKER_01]: updated at some regular frequency, published on our website.

464
00:45:31,105 --> 00:45:33,987
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's kind of language we can plop in a bunch of places.

465
00:45:35,308 --> 00:45:46,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think having it visible outside of just training purposes would be helpful because, you know, Shanine and others will be like,

466
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:49,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Checking it out and being like, oh, look at that.

467
00:45:49,593 --> 00:46:00,720
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't look like it's been updated with this new information because you know there's always more information than there is time to consume it.

468
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,322
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think having that very publicly facing.

469
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:11,467
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also worth noting that the policy itself can include links to district resources.

470
00:46:12,947 --> 00:46:15,949
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know if we establish a.

471
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:21,451
[SPEAKER_01]: just establish a URL that can or a web page, a landing page that has stuff.

472
00:46:21,971 --> 00:46:30,334
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can include that right in the policy because I mean, people will come at this from different perspectives and different points of knowledge.

473
00:46:30,694 --> 00:46:38,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will be like, I go to the Medford School Committee's policy website all the time, which I'm sure is just me and six other people.

474
00:46:38,576 --> 00:46:42,137
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I don't know who they are.

475
00:46:43,282 --> 00:46:43,823
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of them.

476
00:46:44,184 --> 00:46:49,794
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, if they do that, I think it's important that they can find that.

477
00:46:49,834 --> 00:46:50,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think that...

478
00:46:52,009 --> 00:47:00,992
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always trying to be considerate of future school committees because the administration, the employees of the district, you have an awful lot to do.

479
00:47:01,772 --> 00:47:04,473
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember when I joined, I was a headache.

480
00:47:04,573 --> 00:47:09,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I was meeting with every director and asking them all kinds of questions.

481
00:47:10,395 --> 00:47:17,578
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't always pleased with the answers, but it'd be nice if the answers were actually things I could have gotten on my own so you could keep doing your work.

482
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:25,243
[SPEAKER_01]: So having that as facing outward is, I think, really important.

483
00:47:25,603 --> 00:47:25,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne?

484
00:47:27,284 --> 00:47:28,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to also say when

485
00:47:30,078 --> 00:47:42,321
[SPEAKER_04]: because of the length of this, when we do get this to a place where it's ready or to your point when you talked about wanting to have this forward facing on the website, very important.

486
00:47:43,161 --> 00:47:45,542
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to have all things there that are accessible to families.

487
00:47:45,602 --> 00:47:53,463
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do think this is a document that we would want to send out for translation because of the length and because of the content.

488
00:47:53,543 --> 00:47:55,644
[SPEAKER_04]: And that also has a little bit of a

489
00:47:56,404 --> 00:48:10,443
[SPEAKER_04]: turnaround time, and also to just be mindful that whatever links we're putting in here that directs families to other resources, that we know that we're directing families to translated links.

490
00:48:11,372 --> 00:48:13,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, yes, that's a good point.

491
00:48:14,635 --> 00:48:19,439
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does this sound for the next little bit?

492
00:48:19,979 --> 00:48:26,344
[SPEAKER_01]: That we go through the sections and we identify sections we think would be better as guidance.

493
00:48:26,965 --> 00:48:29,747
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to draft the exact language right now.

494
00:48:29,767 --> 00:48:31,629
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do that when we're not all meeting.

495
00:48:32,129 --> 00:48:35,612
[SPEAKER_01]: But to just essentially do what I said,

496
00:48:37,754 --> 00:48:40,195
[SPEAKER_01]: the superintendent will blah, blah, blah.

497
00:48:40,316 --> 00:48:42,037
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to repeat what I said earlier.

498
00:48:43,738 --> 00:48:51,103
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think it would be good if we're all on the same page about what sections we really think need to stay in the policy.

499
00:48:51,123 --> 00:48:54,886
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think we'll all necessarily agree on that.

500
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:59,669
[SPEAKER_01]: But is this fitting on everybody's screen?

501
00:48:59,749 --> 00:49:01,050
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a massive monitor.

502
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:04,693
[SPEAKER_01]: So is this fitting comfortably for you all?

503
00:49:06,848 --> 00:49:07,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

504
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:08,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I see some shaking heads.

505
00:49:08,929 --> 00:49:09,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, good.

506
00:49:10,409 --> 00:49:15,071
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think obviously the policy statement, every policy should have a policy statement.

507
00:49:15,111 --> 00:49:16,492
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that's fine.

508
00:49:17,993 --> 00:49:18,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody disagree?

509
00:49:21,954 --> 00:49:28,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Just raise your hands if you want to comment on a section as I go through it.

510
00:49:28,078 --> 00:49:38,306
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this what is an allergy thing is great, frankly, and I don't think of it as something that's likely to change very often.

511
00:49:38,366 --> 00:49:42,769
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, Jen, do you agree that that's very unlikely to change?

512
00:49:43,557 --> 00:49:46,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is a pretty standard definition that's been around for a while.

513
00:49:46,779 --> 00:49:47,219
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, great.

514
00:49:49,201 --> 00:49:53,503
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think the allergy triggers is wildly educational.

515
00:49:54,164 --> 00:50:01,749
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't naturally want to put it in the policy, but I just feel like it is this also something that isn't likely to change?

516
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:06,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Because these are the bigger categories of and then what could change is what's within them.

517
00:50:06,732 --> 00:50:07,853
[SPEAKER_08]: But these are the bigger categories.

518
00:50:08,808 --> 00:50:11,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I think it's super important to have the visuals.

519
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:12,149
Yeah.

520
00:50:12,529 --> 00:50:14,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's going to increase understanding.

521
00:50:14,909 --> 00:50:16,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually wondering if we could make those larger.

522
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:16,870
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

523
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll worry about that later.

524
00:50:22,631 --> 00:50:25,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody else have comments on just keeping the allergy trigger section?

525
00:50:27,272 --> 00:50:27,492
Great.

526
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:32,873
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I learned so much in this section right here, by the way.

527
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:35,534
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the point, Paul.

528
00:50:37,049 --> 00:50:41,896
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, right?

529
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:48,745
[SPEAKER_09]: The education piece is something that I think was shockingly, like when I came into the district as an allergy parent,

530
00:50:50,445 --> 00:50:56,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to teach some medical staff that you can't use sanitizer to remove allergens.

531
00:50:56,428 --> 00:51:01,411
[SPEAKER_09]: And COVID made that way harder, that like anaphylaxis is not just a breathing emergency.

532
00:51:01,451 --> 00:51:04,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Like there are basic things that people just do not understand.

533
00:51:04,552 --> 00:51:09,995
[SPEAKER_09]: So some piece of the educational bit should be easily accessible and widely disseminated.

534
00:51:10,015 --> 00:51:11,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, so.

535
00:51:11,616 --> 00:51:19,780
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this anaphylaxis chart though, I would argue that that belongs in the guidance because that to me,

536
00:51:21,274 --> 00:51:32,204
[SPEAKER_10]: When people are doing their job on a regular basis, they are going to go to the guidance because that is where their immediate information need is going to be fed.

537
00:51:32,925 --> 00:51:34,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, to me, that's the document that lives.

538
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:36,508
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think.

539
00:51:38,078 --> 00:51:42,440
[SPEAKER_10]: The top part makes sense in the policy, because I think the policy needs to have some context.

540
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:47,723
[SPEAKER_10]: But then, perhaps, as we get down, that top part should be repeated in the guidance.

541
00:51:47,843 --> 00:51:56,987
[SPEAKER_10]: And then this should move to the guidance, because that is where people are going to go when they are trying to use things.

542
00:51:58,523 --> 00:52:04,425
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also not sure we can put graphics, by the way, in our policy service.

543
00:52:04,605 --> 00:52:13,628
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess the only piece that I see that's worth keeping this, and I can take it out of graphic form and just put it into a word form, but is that this continues with the education, right?

544
00:52:14,108 --> 00:52:18,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, I don't think people know that these are symptoms of anaphylaxis.

545
00:52:20,998 --> 00:52:23,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's important that we keep the educational piece in here.

546
00:52:23,721 --> 00:52:31,889
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're going to keep the other educational pieces in here, I've never given an EpiPen for a respiratory emergency.

547
00:52:31,929 --> 00:52:34,051
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always been something else on this list.

548
00:52:35,012 --> 00:52:45,202
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would probably guess that most non-nursing staff and non-allergy parents would not realize that a kid was having anaphylaxis with some of these symptoms.

549
00:52:46,283 --> 00:52:55,130
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would say, again, I'm sorry, I don't want to be repetitive, but I do think tables and visuals are just going to aid in understanding and comprehension for a varied audience.

550
00:52:56,832 --> 00:52:58,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, I like the visual.

551
00:52:58,373 --> 00:53:03,217
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the visual is super important, which is why it belongs in guidance.

552
00:53:03,557 --> 00:53:04,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Paul, I think you're right.

553
00:53:04,698 --> 00:53:08,982
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to find out that none of these graphics can go in the policy document.

554
00:53:10,148 --> 00:53:11,630
[SPEAKER_10]: I will find out.

555
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:14,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's like from straight out of 1985.

556
00:53:14,893 --> 00:53:17,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes, it is.

557
00:53:18,456 --> 00:53:21,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously some of this is going to overlap too.

558
00:53:21,259 --> 00:53:32,649
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we took the graphics out and just put the wording, although I do love the graphics, but if it can't be in the policy, let the graphics and the wording be in the guidance where at least the wording is in the policy.

559
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:33,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

560
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:35,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think the graphic is awesome.

561
00:53:35,953 --> 00:53:36,393
[SPEAKER_01]: I do too.

562
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:37,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.

563
00:53:37,854 --> 00:53:38,715
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

564
00:53:41,577 --> 00:53:44,379
[SPEAKER_01]: So considerations is working with students and caregivers.

565
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,721
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more background.

566
00:53:47,461 --> 00:53:49,463
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any problem with this.

567
00:53:49,683 --> 00:53:53,545
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what other people think.

568
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:59,530
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it belongs in the guidance because I think this is going to change and evolve, right?

569
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:04,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Like these are the considerations right now, but we may see that something else becomes

570
00:54:05,062 --> 00:54:09,825
[SPEAKER_10]: useful in the evolution of how do we work with students and caregivers, right?

571
00:54:13,888 --> 00:54:14,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody?

572
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Jen?

573
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:17,691
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little torn.

574
00:54:17,731 --> 00:54:23,695
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I agree that, yes, things can change when working with students and caregivers, but I think this is a pretty basic about psychological well-being.

575
00:54:26,637 --> 00:54:27,678
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the policy?

576
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:31,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, what's the policy aspect of that statement?

577
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:38,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I guess that makes sense, because I guess there is no specific policy piece to it.

578
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:46,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that what I would like to see is some of this brought into the policy statement, like the why are we here?

579
00:54:48,188 --> 00:54:58,393
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's why I mean, a lot of most of our policies don't have policy statements, but I think they're important to be like, you know, none of us work in the district in the future.

580
00:54:58,513 --> 00:55:01,855
[SPEAKER_01]: And we come to this thing and we're like, well, why is this thing even here?

581
00:55:02,978 --> 00:55:07,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Although in this particular situation, I don't imagine that allergies will be a thing of the past anytime soon.

582
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:11,460
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.

583
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,540
[SPEAKER_01]: So, allergy bullying, absolutely.

584
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:14,440
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to keep that.

585
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:21,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Universal life, universal precautions.

586
00:55:21,862 --> 00:55:27,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that this should stay because this would be the basis for what we're going to kind of do all of

587
00:55:28,003 --> 00:55:30,085
[SPEAKER_08]: what all the rest of the pieces and the guidance are gonna be on.

588
00:55:30,105 --> 00:55:38,615
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is talking about that we have to wash, that we can't use hand sanitizer, we're cleaning surfaces before and after eating so we can prevent cross-contamination.

589
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:43,600
[SPEAKER_08]: So this to me is like the meat of like what we're asking everybody to do as policy.

590
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:49,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm fine, it's short.

591
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:58,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Allergy medications in the school setting, I think we want the details here to be in guidance.

592
00:55:59,545 --> 00:56:10,129
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we probably, well... Isn't there actual policy around allergy medication?

593
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:16,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Like students... We're doing the medication policy next, Jenny.

594
00:56:16,211 --> 00:56:20,393
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a whole new regulation around it.

595
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,501
[SPEAKER_08]: So then does it belong?

596
00:56:24,521 --> 00:56:26,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think we can take it out.

597
00:56:26,121 --> 00:56:28,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think we can take it out completely.

598
00:56:28,202 --> 00:56:28,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

599
00:56:29,562 --> 00:56:37,785
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it should still be in the guidance because I think people need to know what the medication is specific to allergies, but we're gonna be looking at the policy for medications very soon.

600
00:56:37,805 --> 00:56:47,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I think in an evolving way, the guidance could include medication

601
00:56:49,238 --> 00:56:53,864
[SPEAKER_10]: as another piece of the guidance that we're providing around health services, right?

602
00:57:12,995 --> 00:57:13,876
[SPEAKER_01]: like that blah blah.

603
00:57:14,516 --> 00:57:15,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what I meant.

604
00:57:16,037 --> 00:57:36,411
[SPEAKER_01]: So this section here I think like as a title yes and then a statement that you know are we working at this statement that actually says that this will exist and there'll be a reference to those things and then as we develop and work through our

605
00:57:38,953 --> 00:57:40,093
[SPEAKER_01]: collected bargaining agreements.

606
00:57:40,473 --> 00:57:44,074
[SPEAKER_01]: These things can be updated to be accurate.

607
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:45,875
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we expect.

608
00:57:46,995 --> 00:57:49,336
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this was.

609
00:57:50,536 --> 00:57:51,816
[SPEAKER_01]: This is obviously super important stuff.

610
00:57:52,457 --> 00:57:55,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also wondering though, let me go back to the top of this.

611
00:57:57,778 --> 00:58:01,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we probably want to have like a section title related to.

612
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:06,300
[SPEAKER_01]: PTOs that then just points to guidance.

613
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I feel like the PTOs is like

614
00:58:09,996 --> 00:58:19,903
[SPEAKER_01]: one of those ones that's like a heavy hitter for the need for the policy and, um, or maybe it's actually not PTOs.

615
00:58:20,084 --> 00:58:29,751
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, um, what did we call those, Jenny, when we did that policy on, um, booster organizations?

616
00:58:30,431 --> 00:58:30,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

617
00:58:30,792 --> 00:58:36,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think we, I think we called them all the things that they are like it was PTOs.

618
00:58:36,636 --> 00:58:37,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

619
00:58:37,356 --> 00:58:37,757
[SPEAKER_10]: All the things.

620
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:52,558
[SPEAKER_01]: I think inserting a thing about these kinds of organizations need to go to this guidance and then having it, you know, kind of tailored to them.

621
00:58:54,553 --> 00:59:11,324
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the other thing when we start talking about the guidance, I think we do need to send it out again explicitly and ask for people to provide written comment and ask us their questions.

622
00:59:11,384 --> 00:59:17,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think what we're going to get from them are the practical scenarios that are on their mind.

623
00:59:17,829 --> 00:59:18,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, can I do this?

624
00:59:18,729 --> 00:59:19,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I not do this?

625
00:59:20,592 --> 00:59:21,553
[SPEAKER_10]: How do I do this?

626
00:59:21,693 --> 00:59:24,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you saying I don't do this or how do I do that?

627
00:59:24,454 --> 00:59:24,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

628
00:59:25,455 --> 00:59:42,284
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that will give us like a really like rich bank to work from in terms of like, how do we help operationalize these things so that we see that higher success rate and that higher compliance rate.

629
00:59:43,685 --> 00:59:43,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

630
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:45,346
Yeah.

631
00:59:45,546 --> 00:59:48,328
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that's an example where guidance is

632
00:59:50,383 --> 01:00:06,368
[SPEAKER_01]: as great as all of us are in this room with our experiences, the day after guidance is published, somebody will be like, well, what about, and that can't be a whole nother round of policy updates, because that's a few months.

633
01:00:07,309 --> 01:00:11,190
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's see.

634
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I don't remember this section very much.

635
01:00:21,762 --> 01:00:22,442
[SPEAKER_01]: How long is it?

636
01:00:22,622 --> 01:00:23,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's kind of long.

637
01:00:28,645 --> 01:00:31,707
[SPEAKER_10]: So this feels like guidance to me.

638
01:00:34,809 --> 01:00:44,294
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe there are some like, maybe there are some policy related things that sort of like, float up out of this.

639
01:00:47,136 --> 01:00:47,356
[SPEAKER_10]: But

640
01:00:50,609 --> 01:00:55,052
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a procedure, so to me it belongs with the guidance, right?

641
01:00:55,072 --> 01:00:57,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Like this is what we will do when this happens.

642
01:00:58,975 --> 01:01:00,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, procedures should not be in here.

643
01:01:00,936 --> 01:01:01,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

644
01:01:01,296 --> 01:01:01,756
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.

645
01:01:02,237 --> 01:01:02,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Janine?

646
01:01:02,817 --> 01:01:03,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Janine?

647
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:06,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you unmute?

648
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:06,820
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me.

649
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:08,461
[SPEAKER_01]: There you are.

650
01:01:09,401 --> 01:01:09,862
Oh, shoot.

651
01:01:15,986 --> 01:01:16,586
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

652
01:01:16,786 --> 01:01:18,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I switched to my laptop, and now I can't do it.

653
01:01:20,267 --> 01:01:21,567
[SPEAKER_09]: My video won't go on.

654
01:01:22,948 --> 01:01:30,850
[SPEAKER_09]: I do want to make sure that there are some policy things that are retained in the rules and responsibilities.

655
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,531
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that we'll be going over that.

656
01:01:32,611 --> 01:01:40,773
[SPEAKER_09]: But things like there are teachers at the elementary level who are still handing out candy as prizes.

657
01:01:42,645 --> 01:01:43,987
[SPEAKER_09]: This cannot be happening.

658
01:01:44,347 --> 01:01:57,984
[SPEAKER_09]: There needs to be policies about using food in the curriculum and how far in advance families need to be notified if there is a reasonable reason for that thing to be happening and how their child is going to be included.

659
01:02:01,787 --> 01:02:12,974
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand that there are differences between the primary and secondary educational levels and kids' own ability to manage their own allergies.

660
01:02:13,034 --> 01:02:21,980
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that there are some pieces of the role-specific thing that need to be policy and not just guidance, that it's very clear that we should not be serving food.

661
01:02:22,997 --> 01:02:37,028
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Rhetta can speak to this too, because there's also the whatever competitive bidding, I don't remember what it's called, Rhetta, that food can't be served during school hours that's not, hasn't gone through food services, those kinds of things.

662
01:02:37,648 --> 01:02:49,998
[SPEAKER_09]: But just things that are happening right now in our system that aren't really covered in the existing outdated policy that we wanted to make sure we're covered that shouldn't just go to the guidance, but should be very clear policy.

663
01:02:51,222 --> 01:02:52,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I would agree with that.

664
01:02:52,923 --> 01:03:03,813
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think the like, when my kids were in elementary school, they were always excited to take MCAS, because they could bring Jolly Ranchers to school.

665
01:03:05,034 --> 01:03:05,995
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like,

666
01:03:06,655 --> 01:03:07,995
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why you're excited about this.

667
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:10,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you never, ever eat Jolly Ranchers.

668
01:03:11,956 --> 01:03:12,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

669
01:03:13,737 --> 01:03:23,059
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess the other question is like, that's maybe an example of where you would like, just want to say no to that thing.

670
01:03:23,779 --> 01:03:31,461
[SPEAKER_10]: But given that every classroom, especially at the elementary level is potentially going to have something different going on.

671
01:03:33,016 --> 01:03:37,678
[SPEAKER_10]: what are the things that we're like, no, just no completely.

672
01:03:37,878 --> 01:03:47,101
[SPEAKER_10]: And what are the things that are like, there are a set of steps that you go through to understand like what the parameters in your room are.

673
01:03:47,121 --> 01:03:48,181
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what they are.

674
01:03:48,201 --> 01:03:54,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but maybe you have a, maybe you have a room where there are no allergies at all.

675
01:03:54,783 --> 01:03:56,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Like maybe that's true.

676
01:03:56,544 --> 01:04:00,645
[SPEAKER_10]: And what does that, does that change how you operate in that room?

677
01:04:01,165 --> 01:04:02,426
[SPEAKER_10]: versus everybody else.

678
01:04:02,526 --> 01:04:20,958
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not saying you should or shouldn't do something different, but I'm just saying that those are the kinds of things where we just want to, I think we want to be thoughtful about what we're asking people to do to respond to like the facts that are sort of in their dynamic.

679
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:26,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Greta?

680
01:04:27,162 --> 01:04:30,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just want to, I don't think a teacher should be giving out candy,

681
01:04:31,466 --> 01:04:37,188
[SPEAKER_07]: to kids ever, and I feel like there is a policy somewhere that relates to this.

682
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:55,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a different story if a teacher says, oh, MCAS, you can bring in candy, or I know sometimes kids are allowed to bring in gum, and if they bring it in for themselves and are allowed to consume it, that's very different than someone giving it to them when a parent is unaware.

683
01:04:55,495 --> 01:04:56,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

684
01:04:59,589 --> 01:05:05,073
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think even if, whether or not the kids have allergies in the classroom, that doesn't change that.

685
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:08,796
[SPEAKER_07]: There are just some things that should be a policy and shouldn't be done.

686
01:05:08,976 --> 01:05:13,619
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, I believe that that was already written somewhere, but I don't know in what policy.

687
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's competitive foods.

688
01:05:16,221 --> 01:05:19,543
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it certainly doesn't meet the nutrition standards of competitive foods.

689
01:05:19,603 --> 01:05:22,605
[SPEAKER_07]: So from that standpoint, it doesn't.

690
01:05:22,845 --> 01:05:24,406
[SPEAKER_10]: But when you say no candy, like,

691
01:05:26,308 --> 01:05:28,290
[SPEAKER_10]: we have to be clear about what we mean by that.

692
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:33,913
[SPEAKER_10]: We may not hand out candy versus you may never bring candy into the classroom.

693
01:05:33,953 --> 01:05:35,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are two different things, right?

694
01:05:35,775 --> 01:05:47,502
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's a good example of what are we specifically saying you can do and you can't do so that the policy can be clear about that.

695
01:05:48,023 --> 01:05:49,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Teachers may not hand out candy.

696
01:05:49,344 --> 01:05:50,104
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a policy.

697
01:05:50,124 --> 01:05:50,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Fine.

698
01:05:51,105 --> 01:05:51,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.

699
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on from that, but what does that mean?

700
01:05:55,052 --> 01:05:56,921
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, what are the other layers there?

701
01:05:58,558 --> 01:05:59,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Jen, did you want to say something?

702
01:05:59,758 --> 01:06:01,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I can go after you.

703
01:06:01,579 --> 01:06:02,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sure.

704
01:06:02,499 --> 01:06:10,621
[SPEAKER_08]: So one, I think the previous policy, or I don't know if it was ever approved by the school committee, but the policy that we're working on from 2007 says no outside food in the classroom.

705
01:06:10,661 --> 01:06:13,722
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that that's no longer really possible to enforce.

706
01:06:13,742 --> 01:06:28,385
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to echo Rhonda that I think it needs to be more that we are not giving students food, that we can have special celebrations where we're having a movie day, and you can bring your own special snack, or it's MCAS, and you want to bring a piece of gum to chew after or Jolly Ranchers or whatnot.

707
01:06:28,725 --> 01:06:34,129
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think we have to make it clear that there's no sharing or providing of food by our staff for students.

708
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:40,094
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing I wanted to say is I think we can never assume there's no allergies in a classroom.

709
01:06:40,594 --> 01:06:45,258
[SPEAKER_08]: There have been more EpiPens given for accidental exposure to unknown allergies.

710
01:06:46,038 --> 01:07:00,090
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, especially at the secondary level, there has actually been evidence and data that shows that there are more EpiPens given at the secondary level in high school for accidental exposure than at the lower level, because we're just so much more careful about it at the elementary level.

711
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:04,193
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we get this sort of laissez-faire at the secondary, like, oh, kids know their allergies.

712
01:07:04,213 --> 01:07:05,074
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to tell us.

713
01:07:05,595 --> 01:07:06,635
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's not what's happening.

714
01:07:07,436 --> 01:07:10,739
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to be very careful to say that, like, oh, you have allergies in your room.

715
01:07:10,759 --> 01:07:11,580
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to worry about that.

716
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:14,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody should be, we should be implementing the same policy.

717
01:07:14,562 --> 01:07:18,065
[SPEAKER_08]: across the board, whether or not you know that students in your class have allergies.

718
01:07:18,585 --> 01:07:29,134
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's very important that when we're looking at this and stating what is policy, that we make sure that it's clear across the board that no matter what's in your classroom, that this is an expectation.

719
01:07:29,154 --> 01:07:30,455
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not just food.

720
01:07:30,635 --> 01:07:34,318
[SPEAKER_08]: So kids with gluten can't do paper mache.

721
01:07:35,459 --> 01:07:38,141
[SPEAKER_08]: There's other pieces to this that don't include food.

722
01:07:41,472 --> 01:07:43,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh, paper mache.

723
01:07:43,494 --> 01:07:45,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, that just hit me.

724
01:07:45,056 --> 01:07:46,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Or the egg drop, the science egg drop.

725
01:07:47,038 --> 01:07:49,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time they say they're going to do the egg drop, my head like explodes.

726
01:07:49,961 --> 01:07:50,161
[SPEAKER_08]: So much.

727
01:07:50,181 --> 01:07:52,463
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how many kids have egg drops?

728
01:07:52,783 --> 01:07:53,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Geez.

729
01:07:54,285 --> 01:07:55,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I hate all the rules.

730
01:07:57,235 --> 01:08:02,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Nicole, member Branley, you said that you were a para and they were always looking at allergens and stuff.

731
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:10,766
[SPEAKER_09]: I know students who have been handed allergen candies by special education classes in this district.

732
01:08:11,186 --> 01:08:12,807
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not equally implemented.

733
01:08:12,827 --> 01:08:15,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that might very well be the case.

734
01:08:15,629 --> 01:08:17,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying what I experienced in my classroom.

735
01:08:17,911 --> 01:08:21,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, I just wanted to make sure that everybody knew that that's great.

736
01:08:21,274 --> 01:08:23,195
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so glad that that was happening in your classroom.

737
01:08:23,215 --> 01:08:25,297
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not what's happening everywhere.

738
01:08:26,152 --> 01:08:44,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and even to Jen's point too, just one sec, Dr. Ghosi, like I remember even being as a para and they should be, you know, when we did have like a movie day before holiday break or winter break, you know, we would have like the popcorn time, you know, popcorn day, whatever, but we would talk,

739
01:08:45,262 --> 01:08:55,968
[SPEAKER_05]: to each family, we would have them sign a little something, you know, and that was always approved by the principal, you know, but I'm not sure we went by any specific policy either.

740
01:08:56,148 --> 01:09:04,873
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I think that we do have to make sure that we're following something here, you know, that everybody's gonna do universally.

741
01:09:05,294 --> 01:09:08,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if they're following through with it, that's another story, you know what I mean?

742
01:09:08,095 --> 01:09:12,558
[SPEAKER_04]: But... And I agree to all of the above.

743
01:09:13,785 --> 01:09:15,046
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have to be aligned.

744
01:09:15,086 --> 01:09:19,050
[SPEAKER_04]: There has to be something we're all following so that everybody is doing the same thing.

745
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:27,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with Karen's chat comments about it is, you know, on us to be modeling those expectations.

746
01:09:28,438 --> 01:09:33,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I also just want to put two points, though, is that I do think that

747
01:09:34,524 --> 01:09:48,893
[SPEAKER_04]: When we're just making a blanket statement about, you know, teachers aren't doing this and students shouldn't have candy, there does, though, need to be some sort of asterisk because there are students, for medical reasons, that have to receive candy.

748
01:09:48,913 --> 01:09:54,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to look a little bit more into Shanine's comment about

749
01:09:55,377 --> 01:09:58,880
[SPEAKER_04]: special education, then this is not the platform to have that conversation.

750
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,965
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are some students where that is part of their IEP.

751
01:10:04,265 --> 01:10:16,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying what kinds of can be, but I'm just saying there has to be some sort of asterisk around, you know, with the exception of 504, a health plan, an IEP.

752
01:10:17,777 --> 01:10:18,198
[SPEAKER_04]: And then

753
01:10:19,884 --> 01:10:21,225
[SPEAKER_04]: There is that flip side.

754
01:10:21,285 --> 01:10:36,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand what we're talking about with MCAS and making it like from home so that there's some parental oversight and permission, but that's also not the most equitable way to go about it.

755
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:44,165
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would rather have a conversation that's different around what that might look like, because then you're,

756
01:10:46,935 --> 01:10:55,900
[SPEAKER_04]: you're not having all students that are gonna come to class with like a special reward or treat or, you know, to my knowledge, MCAS was lifesavers.

757
01:10:56,540 --> 01:11:08,806
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not Jolly Ranchers and not candy, but I just wanna not close the door to that completely because then we're gonna get into an equity issue.

758
01:11:08,826 --> 01:11:11,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like you think we should stop MCAS.

759
01:11:16,748 --> 01:11:20,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think that's like a great example of like this.

760
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:30,993
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to do it really well, it's much more complicated than just saying no to things because maybe the answer is.

761
01:11:33,027 --> 01:11:43,232
[SPEAKER_10]: We as a district are going to provide X and we are asking for your permission for your kid to have this thing.

762
01:11:43,752 --> 01:11:55,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, but I think that's a great example of like, I don't wanna like, you know, sort of throw it all out with the best of intentions.

763
01:11:55,838 --> 01:12:00,140
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we actually are creating another problem that

764
01:12:02,035 --> 01:12:04,617
[SPEAKER_10]: has to be solved from an equity perspective, right?

765
01:12:06,299 --> 01:12:08,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll let you speak in just a second, Jen.

766
01:12:08,721 --> 01:12:14,326
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's that alternative to site-wide restrictions section that I think is really important.

767
01:12:14,646 --> 01:12:29,739
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad to see that in there, that if we just come out and say, there shall be no candy in Medford Public Schools, we all need to get a grip because that's just not

768
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:34,206
[SPEAKER_01]: At least it's just never going to happen.

769
01:12:35,387 --> 01:12:41,911
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I think that's part of the other issue with policy versus guidance is both policy and guidance.

770
01:12:43,672 --> 01:12:45,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't need anything if it's not implemented.

771
01:12:45,673 --> 01:12:54,878
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, the thing that I like about policy over guidance is that it outlives the employees.

772
01:12:57,426 --> 01:13:00,387
[SPEAKER_01]: And that guidance should outlive the employees, too.

773
01:13:01,027 --> 01:13:14,953
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we'll do a new website someday and all the pages won't get converted and, you know, things vanish and it's a Google Doc and it was attached to Rob's account and Rob retires and suddenly all those Google Docs disappear.

774
01:13:15,033 --> 01:13:22,376
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the technical reasons for which things that are digital vanish is staggering.

775
01:13:25,697 --> 01:13:28,078
[SPEAKER_01]: at least our policies do stick around.

776
01:13:29,099 --> 01:13:36,182
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, we have hundreds of policies that have stuck around, which aren't even legal anymore.

777
01:13:36,782 --> 01:13:38,964
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just nobody who should be following some of those.

778
01:13:40,144 --> 01:13:42,245
[SPEAKER_01]: And my camera is not happy right now.

779
01:13:42,725 --> 01:13:46,147
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, Jen, did you want to say something?

780
01:13:47,368 --> 01:13:47,508
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

781
01:13:47,708 --> 01:13:47,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

782
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:56,272
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 15 minutes, so I want us to get through the list of sections to get looked at again.

783
01:13:56,292 --> 01:14:01,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me go back to where I was.

784
01:14:15,771 --> 01:14:18,352
[SPEAKER_01]: That to me feels very much like something.

785
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:21,373
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have changes in structures.

786
01:14:21,633 --> 01:14:26,634
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have some horrible economic situation and we'll start sharing principles.

787
01:14:27,135 --> 01:14:28,855
[SPEAKER_01]: All kinds of horrible things can happen.

788
01:14:28,875 --> 01:14:30,016
[SPEAKER_01]: That happened in Medford.

789
01:14:30,416 --> 01:14:32,456
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to have principles covering more than one building.

790
01:14:34,217 --> 01:14:37,098
[SPEAKER_01]: which I can't fathom how that was operationalized.

791
01:14:37,398 --> 01:14:42,540
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, and we didn't even have assistant principals at all the schools when I started.

792
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:59,127
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all things that I think are subject to need to really be robust and need to change as things change on the ground.

793
01:15:02,338 --> 01:15:04,442
[SPEAKER_01]: The glossary 100% think that needs to stay here.

794
01:15:04,462 --> 01:15:04,823
[SPEAKER_01]: There was.

795
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:36,206
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't have really the IT infrastructure, and I'm not really sure how much we have now, but I think I wrote a policy that was adopted that said we would actually have a master glossary website, just a URL, and that the committee, through our policy work, would be just adding them on so that 504 plans, as defined here,

796
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:42,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody wanna take bets as to whether it's defined in 15 other policies and has a different definition?

797
01:15:42,924 --> 01:15:45,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's no point.

798
01:15:45,746 --> 01:15:52,651
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that these definitions are repeated all over the place, and they're not necessarily in agreement.

799
01:15:52,691 --> 01:15:55,373
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it doesn't matter if they're not in agreement.

800
01:15:55,794 --> 01:16:00,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Caregivers, some will say parents and guardians, like some of that stuff is irrelevant.

801
01:16:00,938 --> 01:16:02,138
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it does matter,

802
01:16:03,134 --> 01:16:05,134
[SPEAKER_01]: is I think when it really is a problem.

803
01:16:06,055 --> 01:16:16,677
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume the American Academy of Pediatrics isn't gonna change their name soon, but Allergen Anaphylaxis Emergency Plan could get a nice new, shorter, friendlier name in the future.

804
01:16:17,137 --> 01:16:19,978
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyways, I don't need to keep explaining myself.

805
01:16:20,438 --> 01:16:31,121
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully we can get an actual glossary webpage and we can get all the terms that we are using in the district onto one dictionary and then just point to that.

806
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:36,944
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, I actually think they should stay here until we have that.

807
01:16:39,846 --> 01:16:40,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody disagree?

808
01:16:40,747 --> 01:16:44,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

809
01:16:45,611 --> 01:16:46,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Alternatives.

810
01:16:47,373 --> 01:16:48,854
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually like this section.

811
01:16:48,874 --> 01:16:53,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Until I read it, I was like, oh, really?

812
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not all of the pieces.

813
01:17:02,566 --> 01:17:16,436
[SPEAKER_10]: I think these strategies to me, like, in general, these strategies belong in guidance, I think, but again, there may be some things that we want to frame in the policy around.

814
01:17:17,517 --> 01:17:21,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, when we're going to use site wide restrictions.

815
01:17:23,515 --> 01:17:31,721
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, whatever those might be, and sort of point to the guidance for that evolving list, because I think this is going to change.

816
01:17:31,761 --> 01:17:49,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, when we get a new high school and we don't have CAF 1, CAF 2, and CAF 3 anymore, like, I don't know, maybe that changes how operationally these things can be executed, or when the kitchen is completely different, or we change how we deliver food to the schools, whatever it is.

817
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:55,516
[SPEAKER_10]: All of those things sort of need to be updated and maintained.

818
01:17:55,756 --> 01:17:57,598
[SPEAKER_10]: So to me, they rely on guidance.

819
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:10,709
[SPEAKER_10]: But I could see that there might be some site-wide restrictions, like schools may not have allergy tables in their cafeterias.

820
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:12,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

821
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:14,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, maybe that's a site wide restriction.

822
01:18:14,112 --> 01:18:15,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, we're going to do that.

823
01:18:15,393 --> 01:18:18,475
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to do it in every building and that's the end of it.

824
01:18:18,495 --> 01:18:22,999
[SPEAKER_10]: So that there are some things that belong in policy from these lists.

825
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that that makes sense to me.

826
01:18:26,102 --> 01:18:26,382
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.

827
01:18:28,213 --> 01:18:30,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't think I'm going to take chunks.

828
01:18:31,335 --> 01:18:33,376
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to item by item go.

829
01:18:33,536 --> 01:18:35,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is policy like this.

830
01:18:35,597 --> 01:18:37,639
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this isn't policy.

831
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:38,739
[SPEAKER_01]: This is background.

832
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:41,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether or not it stays or not.

833
01:18:44,183 --> 01:18:46,064
[SPEAKER_01]: But like the policy statement might be.

834
01:18:48,225 --> 01:18:50,286
[SPEAKER_01]: You know district wide restrictions.

835
01:18:54,332 --> 01:18:57,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know, but we can figure out where.

836
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:00,718
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to lose it because it's super important information, I think.

837
01:19:00,738 --> 01:19:01,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

838
01:19:06,723 --> 01:19:15,110
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say, you know, we've been kind of using allergy tables as shorthand for like a policy that might stick, but the policy doesn't actually say we shouldn't ever have allergy tables.

839
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:27,441
[SPEAKER_09]: It says we should be working in partnership around a particular like set of needs to decide if that's relevant for like, so like a peanut free table is helpful for a particular group of kids.

840
01:19:27,921 --> 01:19:32,826
[SPEAKER_09]: But if my peanut allergic kid goes and sits at the peanut table and somebody has hummus, he's going to have a reaction to that.

841
01:19:33,466 --> 01:19:37,909
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're not as helpful as we want them to be, but the policy doesn't say we shouldn't have them.

842
01:19:38,049 --> 01:20:01,403
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that potentially, under the cafeteria strategies, the policy, instead of just the recommendation or the guidance, might be that first indented one where it says implementing allergy tables can be complex, but the need for designated tables will be determined for each individual school in consultation with these other parties.

843
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:02,784
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be the policy statement.

844
01:20:05,089 --> 01:20:06,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Who gets to decide?

845
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:09,533
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that to me, not building to build clear.

846
01:20:11,495 --> 01:20:14,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but isn't that what I think?

847
01:20:14,458 --> 01:20:22,746
[SPEAKER_09]: But I guess what seems to be what seems to have happened is that each individual building has decided without talking to central admin.

848
01:20:24,015 --> 01:20:25,416
[SPEAKER_09]: just have different policies.

849
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:40,128
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the Missittook is doing a very different thing than the Roberts, and I don't know what the Brooks and McLennan are doing, but it seems like they've just been able to kind of make their own decisions on style rather than on best practice.

850
01:20:40,208 --> 01:20:49,295
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think the communication with central, with health services and the food services director would be part of the policy is that we make this decision together.

851
01:20:49,795 --> 01:20:53,038
[SPEAKER_09]: And so if there is going to be a building difference that central should know about that.

852
01:20:54,738 --> 01:20:58,411
[SPEAKER_08]: I also think we say in collaboration with caregivers there too, because so.

853
01:21:01,191 --> 01:21:07,015
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you always have to plan for, in nursing we always are like planning for the unexpected, planning for the worst possible thing, right?

854
01:21:07,475 --> 01:21:27,328
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we need to be able to say we're gonna do this in conjunction with caregivers and support from the central office because it may be that for one particular child who has multiple allergies, they need a specific setup versus at another school where there's a child that really only has this one thing we're worried about and so what are we doing for that one child?

855
01:21:28,789 --> 01:21:34,932
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's hard to say we can have, we always go back to the peanut table because those have become kind of a thing of the past.

856
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:42,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Because when we would say, oh, we're going to have a peanut free table, those kids were then being excluded from the rest of their group, right?

857
01:21:42,616 --> 01:21:49,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if we're saying, oh, only the kids who are peanut free have to sit here, then we're not being inclusive.

858
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:54,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas before saying, oh, the kids who bring peanuts can sit here, because now we're saying, well, we've made a choice.

859
01:21:54,462 --> 01:21:55,202
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to bring peanuts.

860
01:21:55,222 --> 01:21:56,202
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to sit at this table.

861
01:21:56,802 --> 01:21:58,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Though I go back and forth about those two.

862
01:21:59,883 --> 01:22:11,247
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think we just, so, but what I wanted to say before I have Shanine said that was, I think that what we can do is when we look at that universal section up near the top, we can pull out some of these things to be in that sort of like universal section.

863
01:22:11,267 --> 01:22:14,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Like this is something that everybody should be doing.

864
01:22:14,308 --> 01:22:17,509
[SPEAKER_08]: We can, you know, rename it, that it's not universal precautions, but yeah.

865
01:22:18,708 --> 01:22:28,116
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that we, I will totally admit that you have just shocked me by saying, we're not going to have the same thing in every cafeteria.

866
01:22:28,156 --> 01:22:34,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I. I am, like, a little bit flabbergasted, like, because I thought that's where we were going, but.

867
01:22:35,775 --> 01:22:54,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you saying though that every school is required to have a cafeteria operations plan that takes into account what has to happen in their cafeteria and that that cafeteria operations plan has to be signed off by certain people?

868
01:22:54,963 --> 01:23:02,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that the policy that, because I feel like what you've just said is it depends and it can be different, but I feel like I also heard a say,

869
01:23:02,623 --> 01:23:04,404
[SPEAKER_10]: It's different and there's no reason why.

870
01:23:04,584 --> 01:23:10,708
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm trying to reconcile those things into something that is actually actionable.

871
01:23:11,568 --> 01:23:11,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

872
01:23:11,788 --> 01:23:17,112
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think what we're looking at here, and I think obviously we spent a lot of this time talking about we want to make sure that all classrooms are doing certain things.

873
01:23:17,452 --> 01:23:22,094
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're looking at now the difference of the cafeteria versus the classrooms is the cafeteria is where food has to happen, right?

874
01:23:22,355 --> 01:23:23,876
[SPEAKER_08]: This is where kids eat.

875
01:23:24,516 --> 01:23:26,977
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to look at what are our possible different options.

876
01:23:27,177 --> 01:23:27,918
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do agree.

877
01:23:28,385 --> 01:23:30,367
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of what you're saying with that cafeteria operations plan.

878
01:23:30,387 --> 01:23:42,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we do have to have, in some way, what should the cafeteria staff, what should food services and health services be collaborating with the principal on to say, this is what this cafeteria has to look like based on our student population.

879
01:23:43,456 --> 01:23:50,642
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is like the one time where there is going to be a little bit of wiggle room, because Johnny at this school is allergic to fava beans, and that's going to be an issue.

880
01:23:51,535 --> 01:23:54,558
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, this kid at this school is allergic to something else and that's going to be an issue.

881
01:23:54,598 --> 01:24:01,485
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have to, the cafeteria is where there has to be a little bit more collaboration to say we might have to do things differently in different schools.

882
01:24:01,525 --> 01:24:08,373
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think what we're trying to say is we don't want it to be that there's this sort of specific table where only these kids can sit.

883
01:24:08,413 --> 01:24:11,236
[SPEAKER_08]: We really need to have a conversation around that and make a plan.

884
01:24:12,537 --> 01:24:20,621
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's about the safety, right, but also about the social emotional well-being inclusion part.

885
01:24:21,381 --> 01:24:24,022
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is all individualized.

886
01:24:24,102 --> 01:24:36,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like Jen said, it's not just about peanuts or nuts and providing that child with a safe, a safe spot while they're eating their food.

887
01:24:37,668 --> 01:24:37,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

888
01:24:40,836 --> 01:24:41,376
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can.

889
01:24:42,116 --> 01:24:42,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Karen.

890
01:24:44,577 --> 01:24:45,737
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think.

891
01:24:49,618 --> 01:25:06,182
[SPEAKER_10]: What I foresee in a cafeteria is all of those things are happening everywhere all at once at all times in the cafeteria, like the social emotional needs, the allergies, the not allergies, all of that is happening at the same time.

892
01:25:06,262 --> 01:25:06,782
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's.

893
01:25:07,492 --> 01:25:14,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I appreciate the desire for us to say we have to, like, do what the kids need us to do.

894
01:25:15,258 --> 01:25:25,686
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think on a practical level, the cafeteria is going to have kids that need us to do each and every single 1 of those things at the same time, which are potentially in conflict.

895
01:25:25,726 --> 01:25:25,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

896
01:25:26,366 --> 01:25:31,130
[SPEAKER_10]: So how do we how do we frame the policy so that.

897
01:25:34,411 --> 01:25:38,652
[SPEAKER_10]: I think what we're trying to do is have some consistency.

898
01:25:38,672 --> 01:25:48,154
[SPEAKER_10]: So how do we frame the rules, the policy, so that we get consistency?

899
01:25:48,174 --> 01:25:56,776
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I was the building principal, I would be like, I thought I had to have

900
01:25:58,582 --> 01:25:59,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Allergen tables.

901
01:25:59,722 --> 01:26:03,063
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I had to have tables where people with peanuts go.

902
01:26:03,763 --> 01:26:08,424
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to have tables where kids without peanuts went and I was told that was bad.

903
01:26:08,464 --> 01:26:09,304
[SPEAKER_10]: So we switched to this.

904
01:26:09,384 --> 01:26:10,944
[SPEAKER_10]: And now you're saying to switch back.

905
01:26:11,004 --> 01:26:13,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I think that's really hard to execute on.

906
01:26:13,605 --> 01:26:27,467
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's, and I don't have the answers necessarily, but I think we have to come up with a framework for people so that they can put together plans that are

907
01:26:28,796 --> 01:26:29,837
[SPEAKER_10]: consistent in some way.

908
01:26:32,718 --> 01:26:35,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Paul, can you bring back up the cafeteria strategies?

909
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:40,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think that we tried to frame it in that way in what we wrote.

910
01:26:46,485 --> 01:26:51,308
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I think that, yes, again, we have to parse out here what's policy and what's just guidance.

911
01:26:52,849 --> 01:26:57,451
[SPEAKER_08]: But really looking at the basic piece here is that we're fostering an inclusive environment.

912
01:26:58,267 --> 01:26:59,628
[SPEAKER_08]: So how do we do that?

913
01:26:59,808 --> 01:27:02,190
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to maybe look a little different in each place.

914
01:27:03,171 --> 01:27:07,634
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of you may be way better at that language than I am.

915
01:27:08,294 --> 01:27:11,136
[SPEAKER_08]: But just looking at what does that language actually look like when it comes to policy.

916
01:27:12,898 --> 01:27:14,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we can work on that.

917
01:27:14,599 --> 01:27:14,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

918
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:21,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Is best practice then that everything is individualized?

919
01:27:21,984 --> 01:27:22,965
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess my only

920
01:27:24,517 --> 01:27:39,504
[SPEAKER_04]: piece and I see where this would require setting up a communication structure so that all principals are following this, working, we have to be very clear about who we're working with and how we're creating this plan.

921
01:27:39,924 --> 01:27:44,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the things that concern me are like the, especially like that K1 lunch.

922
01:27:45,286 --> 01:27:49,828
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're there, and Shanine mentioned it, because there's so many allergies.

923
01:27:49,948 --> 01:27:51,829
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to say that,

924
01:27:53,110 --> 01:28:00,533
[SPEAKER_04]: a plan for one student, I don't know if we can always control what that student's peers are bringing in for lunch.

925
01:28:02,553 --> 01:28:07,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the classroom environments are very much controlled.

926
01:28:08,095 --> 01:28:20,939
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's lots of classrooms around the district that have, it may be a sesame-free classroom, it may be a nut-free classroom, and the cafeteria has been usually like a little bit

927
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:44,736
[SPEAKER_04]: That has somewhat been a space where maybe families that are planning for their own children's lunch, they may know that you can't have this for snack because that happens in the classroom, but your child may be able to eat this because it's in the cafeteria.

928
01:28:45,257 --> 01:28:46,337
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to make sure

929
01:28:47,458 --> 01:28:54,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what is best practice for when we are trying to work around cafeteria planning.

930
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:55,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make sense?

931
01:28:56,421 --> 01:28:56,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

932
01:28:56,681 --> 01:28:59,562
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think best practice is that we have to individualize to an extent.

933
01:29:00,322 --> 01:29:03,183
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a little bit outside of policy, so I don't want to talk about it too much.

934
01:29:03,223 --> 01:29:06,504
[SPEAKER_08]: But one of the things that we have been trying to do from health services

935
01:29:07,044 --> 01:29:09,645
[SPEAKER_08]: is this Be a Pal education program with students as well.

936
01:29:09,705 --> 01:29:17,167
[SPEAKER_08]: So that students are aware of food allergies, that they're getting more education about their peers, what could be happening in the cafeteria, what could be happening in the classroom.

937
01:29:17,587 --> 01:29:25,830
[SPEAKER_08]: And so when we're looking at sort of what's going to be policy, I think on the procedure side, we have to look at bringing that Be a Pal program in as well, which has gone really well.

938
01:29:25,850 --> 01:29:27,950
[SPEAKER_08]: The Mr. Tuck, the Roberts is implementing it this year.

939
01:29:27,970 --> 01:29:30,971
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, just that there's more education all around.

940
01:29:31,031 --> 01:29:33,112
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just about the adults, it's about the students as well.

941
01:29:38,018 --> 01:29:38,719
[SPEAKER_01]: We are here.

942
01:29:38,799 --> 01:29:39,400
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at time.

943
01:29:39,441 --> 01:29:40,843
[SPEAKER_01]: We should just do this last section here.

944
01:29:40,863 --> 01:29:42,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Thoughts on this section here.

945
01:29:52,327 --> 01:30:09,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Policy, I don't remember where it says this, but since we experienced this, it needs to be policy that school personnel cannot recommend that a child should not have a 504 for this, that they can take care of it with their medical plan.

946
01:30:12,339 --> 01:30:22,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think we just have to be clear that the medical plan that is for emergencies or for use in the health services department is not the same as a 504 that's enforceable.

947
01:30:22,782 --> 01:30:30,884
[SPEAKER_08]: And so unfortunately, we've had this happen on many occasions where parents have been told, oh, you don't need a 504 because you have a health care plan.

948
01:30:30,904 --> 01:30:34,346
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think I do agree that I think some of this is policy.

949
01:30:34,366 --> 01:30:39,107
[SPEAKER_08]: We can look at this was from the FAM's recommendation from the food allergy research.

950
01:30:40,708 --> 01:30:42,569
[SPEAKER_08]: I think is where this came from, Shanine, right?

951
01:30:42,589 --> 01:30:43,969
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this was in the FAMS guidance.

952
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:46,791
[SPEAKER_08]: And the FAMS guidance was over 30 pages.

953
01:30:46,831 --> 01:30:49,252
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, we got it a little bit shorter when we came here.

954
01:30:50,753 --> 01:30:52,714
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that's exactly where this came from.

955
01:30:53,394 --> 01:31:07,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that goes back to the education part though, because you can have an individualized healthcare plan as part of a 504 plan, but we can work on the educational part for our staff.

956
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:27,828
[SPEAKER_10]: I do think there is a policy element to this, which is what is our policy about how we have families bring these things to us?

957
01:31:28,208 --> 01:31:32,450
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not being very clear because my brain is just about cooked for today.

958
01:31:34,821 --> 01:31:45,509
[SPEAKER_10]: There should be something in the policy that can go in handbooks that says, if your child has a food allergy, here's the pathway for you.

959
01:31:48,892 --> 01:31:52,515
[SPEAKER_10]: You have options, whatever those options might be.

960
01:31:52,675 --> 01:31:53,756
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be a medical plan.

961
01:31:53,776 --> 01:31:56,117
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be a 504, whatever those things are.

962
01:31:56,157 --> 01:31:58,419
[SPEAKER_10]: And how do I begin to do?

963
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:01,001
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sending my kid to school.

964
01:32:01,742 --> 01:32:03,163
[SPEAKER_10]: I know they have a life-threatening allergy.

965
01:32:04,288 --> 01:32:04,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Who do I call?

966
01:32:05,208 --> 01:32:05,869
[SPEAKER_10]: What do I do?

967
01:32:06,349 --> 01:32:07,029
[SPEAKER_10]: How does it work?

968
01:32:07,149 --> 01:32:07,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

969
01:32:07,670 --> 01:32:20,615
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a piece of this education that has to be available to families on how to engage with us so that plans can be put in place expeditiously if needed.

970
01:32:21,035 --> 01:32:26,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you said, Jen, I was not a child when I learned I had a life-threatening allergy because

971
01:32:27,514 --> 01:32:29,595
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't eat any fish or shellfish at all.

972
01:32:30,376 --> 01:32:32,517
[SPEAKER_10]: And until I did, I had no idea.

973
01:32:32,537 --> 01:32:37,300
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you do learn about allergies and they change over time, right?

974
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:42,704
[SPEAKER_10]: So where do we put the like reference?

975
01:32:43,104 --> 01:32:49,909
[SPEAKER_10]: So certainly that maybe the policy statement is the district will maintain a webpage that talks about how to do this.

976
01:32:51,009 --> 01:32:56,573
[SPEAKER_10]: But it does seem to me to like, if it lives in policy,

977
01:32:57,703 --> 01:33:04,310
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fine, but parents don't go to the policy handbook to serve these kinds of needs.

978
01:33:04,390 --> 01:33:19,425
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe the policy is that there is a mechanism to do this within expedited turnaround time or something like that versus trying to net that out in the policy document.

979
01:33:21,747 --> 01:33:21,827
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

980
01:33:32,862 --> 01:33:52,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, really quickly, this is not, um, because Paul, you might not be aware in your, um, looking at the policies that, um, and I know Jen is on top of this as well, but there's currently legislation going through, um, at the state level that would broaden the use and, um, kind of

981
01:33:54,166 --> 01:34:18,189
[SPEAKER_09]: the the use and storage of epinephrine so that like police officers are able to have it and all these other people are able to have access that restaurants can have stock epinephrine so those laws also can help inform our policy as they are passed and they're they're likely to pass but they're very very exciting since we know that so many people who do have a reaction are was it was it like 10 percent or 25 percent Jen

982
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:22,813
[SPEAKER_09]: of people who have a reaction inside a school are not known.

983
01:34:23,954 --> 01:34:30,040
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes it's the mailman who has a sort of anaphylactic reaction in the school when he's dropping something off.

984
01:34:31,061 --> 01:34:36,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think, though, just to piggyback on that, that will become part of our medication policy and not necessarily this policy.

985
01:34:37,187 --> 01:34:37,408
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

986
01:34:38,429 --> 01:34:38,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

987
01:34:39,807 --> 01:34:52,340
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as that, as soon as that comes down, anything we need, as soon as we can get this completed before this law is changed, I would really be annoyed if they happen like the week before we approve it.

988
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:55,203
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna make

989
01:34:58,636 --> 01:35:08,700
[SPEAKER_01]: the motion to have the administration in collaboration with Chair Rousseau, myself, rework the policy proposal to move appropriate sections to guidance.

990
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:14,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that sound OK?

991
01:35:15,103 --> 01:35:15,763
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the next step.

992
01:35:16,803 --> 01:35:18,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a second?

993
01:35:19,885 --> 01:35:20,165
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

994
01:35:21,065 --> 01:35:21,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

995
01:35:22,946 --> 01:35:24,466
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, yeah, let's do that.

996
01:35:25,827 --> 01:35:26,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

997
01:35:27,047 --> 01:35:27,168
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

998
01:35:30,973 --> 01:35:31,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Branley.

999
01:35:34,756 --> 01:35:35,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Did we lose?

1000
01:35:35,997 --> 01:35:36,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'm here.

1001
01:35:37,358 --> 01:35:37,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you are.

1002
01:35:37,858 --> 01:35:38,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

1003
01:35:38,339 --> 01:35:38,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

1004
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:40,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm still sharing, which I should stop.

1005
01:35:40,681 --> 01:35:41,881
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see everybody.

1006
01:35:41,962 --> 01:35:42,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, great.

1007
01:35:42,482 --> 01:35:43,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1008
01:35:44,123 --> 01:35:45,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Ruseau, yes.

1009
01:35:45,965 --> 01:35:47,125
[SPEAKER_01]: And Member Graham.

1010
01:35:47,646 --> 01:35:47,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1011
01:35:49,087 --> 01:35:49,307
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1012
01:35:49,948 --> 01:35:51,409
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we have a good

1013
01:35:52,717 --> 01:35:57,058
[SPEAKER_01]: set up next steps with all the notes that I took in the document.

1014
01:35:57,818 --> 01:36:18,461
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna also have to, I'll get ahold of Will to have him set up a page, sort of as a landing page for guidance, unless we already have one, so that we can put that right into the actual policy instead of saying, we'll get to it in the future, which I don't know about you, but I'm all, but I'm pretty busy.

1015
01:36:18,481 --> 01:36:20,602
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get it done.

1016
01:36:21,942 --> 01:36:30,906
[SPEAKER_01]: And then obviously after we've reworked this, I'll schedule another one of these meetings and if we can cross our fingers, it'll be the last meeting.

1017
01:36:31,726 --> 01:36:35,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I don't enjoy this, but we actually have to pass something.

1018
01:36:37,329 --> 01:36:40,310
[SPEAKER_01]: So any other final words from anybody?

1019
01:36:42,871 --> 01:36:44,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

1020
01:36:44,372 --> 01:36:46,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I can motion to adjourn.

1021
01:36:55,573 --> 01:36:56,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Brandly?

1022
01:36:56,854 --> 01:36:57,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1023
01:36:57,854 --> 01:36:58,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham?

1024
01:36:59,075 --> 01:36:59,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1025
01:37:00,076 --> 01:37:00,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Ruseau?

1026
01:37:01,276 --> 01:37:02,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1027
01:37:02,477 --> 01:37:05,078
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate this great conversation, everyone.

1028
01:37:05,098 --> 01:37:08,780
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think we're getting, we are getting somewhere.

1029
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:18,966
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it's been a very long time coming and Shanine is, I appreciate the pokes to be like, what are we talking about?

1030
01:37:19,086 --> 01:37:23,348
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and you know, cause everything's always, there's so much always in our faces.

1031
01:37:23,368 --> 01:37:24,069
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fluid, yeah.

1032
01:37:25,518 --> 01:37:30,520
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to stay focused too long on one thing before something else grabs our focus.

1033
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:31,940
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate it.

1034
01:37:32,061 --> 01:37:33,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody have a wonderful evening.

1035
01:37:33,541 --> 01:37:34,461
[SPEAKER_01]: This meeting is adjourned.

1036
01:37:35,122 --> 01:37:35,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1037
01:37:35,542 --> 01:37:36,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everybody.

1038
01:37:36,422 --> 01:37:36,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye bye.
