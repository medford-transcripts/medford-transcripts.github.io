1
00:00:00,832 --> 00:00:04,115
Welcome to tonight's meeting of the Medford Community Development Board.

2
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:05,556
I'll call the meeting to order.

3
00:00:05,716 --> 00:00:08,639
Let's begin with some regulatory procedural matters.

4
00:00:09,838 --> 00:00:14,359
This hearing of the Medford Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means.

5
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:24,383
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings as provided for in Chapter 22 of the Acts of 2023.

6
00:00:24,823 --> 00:00:31,805
A reminder that anyone who would like to listen to or view this meeting in long progress may do so by accessing the link that was included.

7
00:00:32,477 --> 00:00:36,119
on the meeting agenda posted on the city of Medford's website.

8
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:44,182
If, despite our best efforts, we are not able to provide real-time access, we will post a recording of this meeting on the city's website as soon as possible.

9
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:49,485
A reminder that given the remote nature of this meeting tonight, all votes from the board will be made by roll call.

10
00:00:50,245 --> 00:00:55,988
Please know that the project materials for all projects before the board can be viewed on the city's website at medfordma.org.

00:00:57,378 --> 00:00:59,739
And you can click on current CD board filings.

12
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:01,899
Daniel will provide the link in the chat.

13
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,880
I'm going to do a roll call attendance for the board.

14
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,041
Vice-chair Emily Hedeman.

15
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:08,241
Present.

16
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:10,602
Peter Kautz.

17
00:01:13,463 --> 00:01:14,143
Ari Fishman.

18
00:01:18,324 --> 00:01:19,224
I saw Ari.

19
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:21,825
Present.

20
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:22,705
Awesome.

21
00:01:23,406 --> 00:01:24,246
Pam Marianski.

22
00:01:27,224 --> 00:01:27,544
Pam.

23
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:30,405
Sally Akiki.

24
00:01:31,486 --> 00:01:31,886
Present.

25
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:34,747
Sherrod Bacharia.

26
00:01:35,547 --> 00:01:35,967
Present.

27
00:01:36,687 --> 00:01:38,088
And myself, Jacqueline Person.

28
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:45,030
Let's see, Danielle, can you please introduce anyone from the staff?

29
00:01:49,252 --> 00:02:01,021
Yes, with us tonight is Alicia Hunt, the Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability, Clem Doucette, who is a graduate student intern in our office, and myself, Danielle Evans, Senior Planner.

30
00:02:04,343 --> 00:02:04,784
Thank you.

31
00:02:07,038 --> 00:02:15,844
So the first item on our agenda this evening after getting into order is a special permit drive-thru use for 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway, Bank of America.

32
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:17,765
It's continued from 10-4-23.

33
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:29,813
The applicant is applying for a special permit for a bank drive-thru ATM at 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway, which is in the Meadowbrook Mall, aka Wegman Plaza, specifically the northerly service parking lot.

34
00:02:30,694 --> 00:02:37,499
The special permit grant authority is the city council, and it has been referred to the city board for the board's recommendation on the matter.

35
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:46,587
The matter has been continued several times in order to redesign the site plan to satisfy planning staff and for sign on from other tenants on the shopping plaza.

36
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:53,212
I'm going to invite the applicant to introduce yourselves now, and you can present any updates on the proposal.

37
00:02:56,848 --> 00:02:57,348
Good evening.

38
00:02:57,368 --> 00:02:59,809
This is Bill Lucas with Boulder Engineering.

39
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:08,631
I'm here with Craig of CBRE and Andy of Permit Expeditors.

40
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:13,892
I believe everybody is well aware of both of those folks based on the fact that we've been here a few times.

41
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,553
I'm going to try to share my screen now.

42
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:23,814
Danielle, have you provided screen sharing ability to all three of those members?

43
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,451
I should.

44
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:26,131
I should have.

45
00:03:29,315 --> 00:03:29,556
Great.

46
00:03:30,517 --> 00:03:32,960
I believe everybody can see the screen now.

47
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,540
Yes.

48
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:34,462
Great.

49
00:03:34,502 --> 00:03:34,862
Thank you.

50
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:42,371
So, moving forward, Bank of America, 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway.

51
00:03:44,508 --> 00:04:02,002
As was described, this is a northern portion of the Meadow Glen Mall parking lot, which on your screen is in the lower left-hand corner, delineated by that red box noted as the project site.

52
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:09,528
And the overall Glen Meadow property itself is identified in this purple line outline.

53
00:04:11,873 --> 00:04:18,995
This is a little zoomed in view of that portion of the parking lot that we are proposing to develop for the Bank of America itself.

54
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:31,018
As you can see, it is underutilized from a parking standpoint, making it a great opportunity to further develop and enhance the Meadow Glen Mall.

55
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:50,352
The proposal that you see in front of you is slightly changed from our previous meeting in front of this board to primarily add parking to the rear of the site, which is the eastern portion that you see at the back of the screen.

56
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:57,878
Previously, this proposal was just for the 5,500 square foot bank that you see in the lower left.

57
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:13,593
section of the plan itself, including parking that primarily surrounded that bank and then allowed access to the drive aisle on the right hand side, which is an existing drive aisle to the Meadow Glen Mall.

58
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:28,244
And we were also proposing a new curb cut, full movement access out to Locust Street here on the bottom center of the plan, and then a exit only drive

59
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:45,438
also out to Locust Street on the left-hand side of the bank itself, thereby allowing drive-through traffic to traverse the site in a counterclockwise fashion and stack on the left-hand side or the northern side of the bank itself.

60
00:05:49,435 --> 00:06:04,367
One other enhancement that I forgot to bring up that we had discussed previously was a pocket park that we've included on the northeastern side of the intersection of the drive aisle and Locust Street.

61
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:07,710
That has not been changed since our last meeting.

62
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:16,137
This gives you a quick representation of the building itself as viewed from Locust Street.

63
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:25,445
A 2nd, view of that building and on the left would be the drive file for the drive through window service.

64
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:34,533
This exhibit again, we have provided previously just outlining.

65
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,573
where pedestrian traffic could occur on the site itself.

66
00:06:40,633 --> 00:07:01,470
There's existing sidewalk along Locust Street and along the drive aisle up to Meadow Glen Mall, but then now we have the additional pedestrian circulation that can happen to the Bank of America, to the parking field, and through the pocket park itself based on

67
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:10,123
Previous comments from the fire marshal, we have delineated a 2 different scenarios for.

68
00:07:11,624 --> 00:07:21,414
Fire truck traffic or circulation around the site in an emergency condition that shows you access from locus street around the building itself.

69
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:33,941
And this provides, again, a different second route from Logan Street onto the drive aisle into Meadow Glen and then around the back of the building.

70
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:38,843
Now, unfortunately, this was not updated for the full parking field at the rear of the site.

71
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:46,866
But dimensionally, these drive aisles line up exactly with the additional parking that we were showing previously.

72
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:51,167
Based on that, I will open it up to questions.

73
00:07:53,116 --> 00:08:00,222
And or if Craig would like to make any statements on behalf of Bank of America.

74
00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:04,046
Yeah, no, thanks, Bill.

75
00:08:04,386 --> 00:08:05,527
Appreciate you presenting that.

76
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:16,957
And my thanks to everyone here on the call for just working with us, especially the planning department, Danielle, Amanda, Alicia, appreciate the feedback.

77
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:19,817
and getting us here to where we are today.

78
00:08:20,557 --> 00:08:22,059
We have received landlord approval.

79
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:27,083
All tenants have approved the layout as you see it today.

80
00:08:28,404 --> 00:08:32,468
So we, again, appreciate your time this evening.

81
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:37,232
And if you have any questions, obviously, like Bill said, please go ahead.

82
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:53,954
Jackie, you're on mute.

83
00:09:03,265 --> 00:09:03,785
Thank you.

84
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:04,626
Sorry.

85
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,268
Thank you so much for your presentation.

86
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:07,169
I appreciate it.

87
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:09,111
We appreciate it at this time.

88
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,095
We're going to ask if the city staff has any comments that they want to add.

89
00:09:16,553 --> 00:09:26,456
Madam Chair, I'll just add that we appreciate Bank of America working with us to meet the requests of the city and the current standards of the city.

90
00:09:26,476 --> 00:09:37,940
And we appreciate the property owner working with us to meet the needs of the city as well, and going back to their other tenants to get their full approvals as needed for this.

91
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,941
I don't know if Danielle wants to speak to any specifics, but I did just want to thank them for working with us on this.

92
00:09:44,222 --> 00:09:45,422
I realize it hasn't been easy.

93
00:09:47,158 --> 00:09:56,223
Yes, through the chair, I also want to thank the applicants for really significantly improving this proposal.

94
00:09:59,405 --> 00:10:09,890
It wasn't easy to work with some of the other tenants where it was their corporate headquarters, so it wasn't even, you know, people that's like on site and getting those approvals and

95
00:10:12,465 --> 00:10:24,289
coming up with a compromise to keep some of the rear parking field as the compromise to get sign off from the other tenants at this time.

96
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:35,012
And I feel that at some point in the future, we'll be able to demonstrate that that area is not needed and that something, a higher and better use to go there.

97
00:10:40,414 --> 00:10:40,814
Thank you.

98
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:53,017
I will open it up to the board and I want to remind the board that there are some conditions that have been set forth, recommended by the city for us to deliberate on as we go through.

99
00:10:53,517 --> 00:11:00,980
We can either adopt, amend, disagree, or totally change them as you wish to go through.

100
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:03,301
I'm not sure if you've all had a chance to look at them.

101
00:11:05,723 --> 00:11:08,684
But I will open it up for deliberation now from the board.

102
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:21,066
Any board members have questions on the conditions or clarifications?

103
00:11:34,313 --> 00:11:38,376
All right, hearing none, I'm going to open it up for public comment, just in case there's public comment.

104
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:42,358
If there's anyone that wants to speak from the public.

105
00:11:43,998 --> 00:11:50,040
Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature, which places you in the line to be recognized and unmuted by staff.

106
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,681
Individuals may have up to two minutes to provide comments.

107
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:56,102
Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

108
00:11:56,662 --> 00:11:58,763
You can also provide written comments via email.

109
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:03,252
to ocd-ma.gov.

110
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:10,375
A reminder to all meeting participants to refrain from using the chat function to post or message comments as it is not part of the public record.

111
00:12:10,735 --> 00:12:17,497
However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to let myself and staff.

112
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:25,100
Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue and acknowledge any previously sent emails or letters regarding this item?

113
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:33,821
Yes, I don't see anyone from the public looking to speak to this.

114
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:41,885
I have not received any emails on this at all.

115
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:50,849
So we can probably close that portion of the hearing or meeting.

116
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:52,590
It's not a public hearing.

117
00:12:57,752 --> 00:12:59,053
And also, should I share?

118
00:12:59,073 --> 00:13:03,154
Would it be helpful if I share the conditions?

119
00:13:04,155 --> 00:13:05,315
Yes, please.

120
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:07,256
OK.

121
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:13,259
Let's see.

122
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,400
Bill, are you the one who's currently screen sharing?

123
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:18,001
Let's see.

124
00:13:18,061 --> 00:13:18,441
OK.

125
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:21,903
I was, and I dropped it for you.

126
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:37,522
We hunt for this.

127
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:37,582
Oh.

128
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:11,887
And while we do that, I'm going to close the public comment.

129
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:26,357
We're going to make this bigger.

130
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,641
Can everybody see this okay?

131
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:35,564
Yeah, that looks good, Danielle.

132
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:47,002
So some conditions are the updated control plans, any plan modifications.

133
00:14:47,862 --> 00:14:56,385
You need to come back to speak with staff to see if it's a minor change or if it needs to come back to the board.

134
00:14:56,405 --> 00:14:59,687
And that when this is approved, that you will record this.

135
00:15:01,487 --> 00:15:03,028
Prioritizations for building permit.

136
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:07,530
You need to update or submit an updated

137
00:15:09,023 --> 00:15:17,705
detailed landscaping plan to PDS and showing us the final species selection for us to sign off on.

138
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:28,006
My understanding is there is not an updated landscaping plan yet, but you can submit that by building permit.

139
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:36,988
And can you speak to where you'll provide the EV charging station?

140
00:15:40,018 --> 00:15:41,518
Or can you confirm that you're able to?

141
00:15:42,438 --> 00:15:43,659
Hi, Danielle.

142
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:48,740
So that was a discussion we've had with the Wegmans landlord.

143
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,861
But that's part of their profile that will be added for the entire center.

144
00:15:56,661 --> 00:16:05,462
So being that we're tenants in that shopping center, that we weren't either required to do it by them, because we'll fit into that.

145
00:16:05,942 --> 00:16:08,583
They'll accommodate the tenants with their EV charging stations.

146
00:16:10,118 --> 00:16:23,446
Unless you're deeming that we need to provide it separately from the shopping center, but Jane, the representative from that group has sent an email saying that they're in the process of working on that plan.

147
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:28,609
And they'll roll that out to all of their shopping centers that that's within their business profile.

148
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:33,535
Through the chair, I guess I'll defer to Alicia.

149
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:48,659
Now that the city has adopted the specialized stretch code, are they required to at least lay the conduit down under their parking lot, or is it treated as the entire plaza?

150
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:59,903
Because this is part of our performance standards that we provide EV chargers, but knowing that this is a multi-tenanted property, I'm not sure if there's

151
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:07,225
Any guidance on where, how many EV chargers there would need to be?

152
00:17:07,245 --> 00:17:12,228
Because I don't know what the Meadow Glen Mall's plans would be.

153
00:17:16,672 --> 00:17:18,313
So it's part of building code.

154
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:32,603
So it's not, whether or not we include it in the requirements, they would have to, so it's 20% of parking needs to be EV ready wiring for residential and business.

155
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:40,595
But that's not charging stations, that's the wiring and that's part of building code.

156
00:17:44,015 --> 00:18:01,026
Requiring a charging station would be at the discretion of the Community Development Board and whether or not you feel that having them installed over by Wegmans rather than by the bank is more appropriate or is a requirement or is even allowed.

157
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:06,950
That would be something that the commission could talk about, but it is not part of building code.

158
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:12,114
Building code is that they have to do some pre-wiring for EV charging.

159
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:20,225
So, for their building permit on their leased area, they'll need to prewire.

160
00:18:21,126 --> 00:18:26,815
That's our understanding of the building code and that's something that the building department would need to review.

161
00:18:33,324 --> 00:18:45,349
And Danielle or Alicia, does that also mean that 20% of the parking field associated in and around the area of the Bank of America should be pre-wired?

162
00:18:46,689 --> 00:19:00,495
Honestly, I feel like that is the kind of question that is out of our scope to answer that the building commissioner or the building inspectors would need to actually tell you how they're interpreting the new building code.

163
00:19:02,582 --> 00:19:04,623
It's a lot easier.

164
00:19:04,703 --> 00:19:16,448
If we were looking at a residential structure with a residential parking garage, I think it would be easy to say, yeah, the building department is going to require that 20% of those spots have power brought into them.

165
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:25,372
Whether they're going to require that under an outdoor parking field, I actually have not dug deep enough into the building code to know if that's also required or not.

166
00:19:27,953 --> 00:19:28,353
OK, thank you.

167
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:38,451
So what would be the proper way to condition it so that it doesn't provide undue burden onto the proponent if it's something that we can't determine at this juncture now?

168
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:45,376
So it's unnecessary for the board to condition things that are in building code.

169
00:19:45,816 --> 00:19:48,578
Building code only talks about pre-wiring spaces.

170
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:52,640
It does not talk about required charging stations.

171
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:54,742
If the board would like

172
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:57,314
to require that of the applicant.

173
00:19:57,794 --> 00:20:06,796
And what they're saying right now is that it sounds like, if I understand correctly what you said, you said Wegmans is going to put in charging by their store?

174
00:20:06,816 --> 00:20:09,496
No, not by Wegmans, but the landlord in whole.

175
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:17,018
So that whole shopping center is going to be encompassed in their EV charging initiative.

176
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:24,439
So they will take the entirety of the leasable parcel, which includes Bank of America,

177
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:33,342
and they will install the required amount of EV charging stations because we haven't separated the parcel from there.

178
00:20:33,402 --> 00:20:35,603
We're still a tenant of that landlord.

179
00:20:35,643 --> 00:20:49,330
So the landlord has told me that as part of their sustainability and the electrical vehicle charging initiative, they will install that in the future.

180
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,511
They're just in the middle of

181
00:20:51,268 --> 00:20:57,311
rolling that out and how and when that looks like and when they haven't determined yet.

182
00:20:57,351 --> 00:21:02,114
But that is part of the future development of that shopping center is what I was told.

183
00:21:02,134 --> 00:21:13,020
And to add to that, Alicia, we would be happy, the bank would, to get this approved so there's no more holdups.

184
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,521
I've already spoken to senior leadership at the bank.

185
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:18,823
And if it's required for us to put in future wiring,

186
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:23,981
uh, for, you know, our, for our use at the bank, we're, we're happy to comply.

187
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:34,488
So through the chair, one of the performance standards that, um, nonresidential, um,

188
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:40,934
projects need to comply with, if not for projects requiring special permits.

189
00:21:41,615 --> 00:22:02,530
So that's why I put, because when I was, you know, analyzing the project against the special permit criteria, as well as the performance standards, one of those is vehicle charging stations, and that they should, the applicant will incorporate vehicle charging infrastructure to the maximum extent feasible into its parking areas and make provision for future expansion of such infrastructure.

190
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:02,590
So

191
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,392
So, again, Daniel, we're happy to do that, but is that number based on.

192
00:22:10,052 --> 00:22:15,055
We require 26 parking spaces, so then 20% of those 26 parking spaces.

193
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:21,139
Is what we would need to pre wire that I guess that maybe that's what Alicia saying the building department would need to determine that.

194
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:29,984
Well, there's 2 things going on there's building code requirements and then there's performance standards of our zoning ordinance and.

195
00:22:31,044 --> 00:22:33,446
The zoning ordinance doesn't, um.

196
00:22:34,606 --> 00:22:35,067
Give a.

197
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:42,586
A hard number, it just says that you'll incorporate vehicle charging infrastructure to the maximum extent feasible.

198
00:22:42,606 --> 00:22:46,749
And I felt that 1 charging.

199
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,372
Station would be sufficient.

200
00:22:50,392 --> 00:22:53,835
1 station with 2.

201
00:22:56,777 --> 00:22:58,779
And I will say that if you provide charges.

202
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:11,270
that really, even for employees to use that's convenient, then that does increase EV ownership.

203
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:25,415
So if there is an employee at the bank who knew there was an EV charger on site, even if it doesn't have to be free, you can charge for the electricity, that it does increase EV ownership.

204
00:23:28,357 --> 00:23:29,737
I can tell you now that we'll edit.

205
00:23:30,057 --> 00:23:33,358
We want to be good members of the community we're moving into.

206
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,879
We have no problem with doing that.

207
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:40,439
So I'll make that happen at this location, no problem.

208
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,260
So you're okay with condition number five as written?

209
00:23:47,981 --> 00:23:48,661
Yes, ma'am, I am.

210
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:50,221
Okay, thank you.

211
00:23:51,161 --> 00:23:56,202
Is the board okay with number five as written after hearing what has been presented by the city?

212
00:23:57,899 --> 00:23:59,339
Does anybody have any questions?

213
00:24:10,523 --> 00:24:11,123
No questions.

214
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:11,744
Thanks.

215
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:12,304
Thanks chair.

216
00:24:17,265 --> 00:24:21,127
Well, I want to just echo what the city has said, and I want to thank the applicant for.

217
00:24:22,772 --> 00:24:34,992
just your diligence and remaining the course and getting us to a plan that's approved across the board by all and all the work that you've done and being a minimal to the suggestions and the changes and.

218
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:44,204
It's just really appreciated, especially with the enhancing of the landscape and with the pocket park on the corner and just making sure that you're a good neighbor overall.

219
00:24:44,744 --> 00:25:02,713
So I actually, with the conditions as set forth, I'm going to go ahead and ask for, if there's no other questions from the board, I'm going to request the motion to recommend the city council approval of the special permit subject to the conditions outlined in the staff dated memo 10-17-2023, in which Danielle was shown on the screen.

220
00:25:07,825 --> 00:25:09,205
I have a motion, Sally.

221
00:25:11,706 --> 00:25:12,086
Second.

222
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:14,207
I'll second.

223
00:25:15,927 --> 00:25:17,248
All right, I'm going to do a roll call.

224
00:25:18,008 --> 00:25:19,228
Vice Chair Emily Hedeman?

225
00:25:20,108 --> 00:25:20,388
Yes.

226
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:22,089
Ari Fishman?

227
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,511
Ari, your sound's not working.

228
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:32,312
Is that a thumbs up?

229
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:33,092
OK.

230
00:25:33,912 --> 00:25:34,732
Thalia Kiki?

231
00:25:36,413 --> 00:25:36,613
Yes.

232
00:25:41,698 --> 00:25:41,998
Yes.

233
00:25:42,838 --> 00:25:45,080
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

234
00:25:46,741 --> 00:25:50,303
Thank you so much for being here this evening.

235
00:25:50,503 --> 00:25:53,925
And you're all set.

236
00:25:54,966 --> 00:25:55,966
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.

237
00:25:55,986 --> 00:25:56,667
We appreciate it.

238
00:25:56,767 --> 00:25:58,168
And the board, thank you very much.

239
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:58,808
We appreciate it.

240
00:25:58,828 --> 00:26:00,749
We look forward to being excited to be a part of your community.

241
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:06,393
And to Danielle and Alicia, thank you very much for all your help in guiding us to this point.

242
00:26:06,892 --> 00:26:07,512
Appreciate that.

243
00:26:07,552 --> 00:26:08,453
Thank you all very much.

244
00:26:08,993 --> 00:26:09,813
Thank you.

245
00:26:10,293 --> 00:26:11,093
Have a good evening.

246
00:26:11,374 --> 00:26:12,214
Have a good evening.

247
00:26:12,434 --> 00:26:12,814
Thank you.

248
00:26:20,517 --> 00:26:28,059
The next item on our agenda this evening is A&R for Bradley.

249
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,380
Let's see, what is the address for Bradley?

250
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,280
26 Bradley Road.

251
00:26:33,648 --> 00:26:36,869
And that's ANR, which is Approval Not Required Plan for Review.

252
00:26:40,811 --> 00:26:46,493
At this time, I'm just going to invite the proponent to present their plans for 15 Hadley.

253
00:26:46,573 --> 00:26:51,155
Introduce yourself and to present your plans for 15, I'm sorry, 26 Bradley Road.

254
00:26:52,816 --> 00:26:55,577
Hi, my name is Paolo Wojcik.

255
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,262
I represent the owner of the Bradley Road LLC.

256
00:27:02,002 --> 00:27:06,785
And what we propose is we want to combine the lots.

257
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:11,267
There is one owner for both lots.

258
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:18,970
Basically, it's simply we just try to remove the line, the border.

259
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,792
We just want to combine those two lots to be one lot.

260
00:27:23,812 --> 00:27:25,373
Instead of two lots being one lot.

261
00:27:31,756 --> 00:27:32,156
Thank you.

262
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,017
Thank you so much, Mr. Powell.

263
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:36,978
Yes.

264
00:27:37,498 --> 00:27:37,738
Yes.

265
00:27:38,118 --> 00:27:38,638
Thank you.

266
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,201
If you don't have anything further, I'm going to ask comments from the city staff.

267
00:27:50,062 --> 00:27:57,925
I'm going to share my screen for anyone who wants to see this.

268
00:28:06,371 --> 00:28:13,492
As you can see, so this is Bradley Road that's just behind the square.

269
00:28:13,512 --> 00:28:29,675
And up, let's see, if you can see my cursor, this is parcel B. As you can see that there is a lot line here, and this is what they're proposing to, you know, delete this lot line so that it is all one parcel.

270
00:28:37,058 --> 00:28:53,182
And it's an approval not required, meaning that this is pretty much just a formality, because the city of Medford is bound by the subdivision control law, which does not vest the power to sign off on these with the planning director.

271
00:28:53,422 --> 00:28:57,583
It has to be the city planning board, so you all the community development board.

272
00:28:58,643 --> 00:29:03,064
Because it's combining lots, the frontage isn't changing, all of that.

273
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,485
you know, things that you would usually look at for separating lots.

274
00:29:11,027 --> 00:29:15,852
So this is a pretty straightforward A&R.

275
00:29:18,034 --> 00:29:27,723
And because it's straightforward, technically all we're doing is, as you said, it's a formality where we're certifying that it's an approval not required because in this case, the city can't do that.

276
00:29:29,148 --> 00:29:30,409
And it meets all the criteria.

277
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:38,876
So, for me, I don't know if there's any questions from the board, but I can just ask for a motion.

278
00:29:41,017 --> 00:29:46,622
Since the city has affirmed that the criteria has been met, I'll ask for a motion to approve.

279
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:49,293
Although there's no approval needed.

280
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:59,597
So I guess we're just making sure that we're all in agreement just by doing a roll call.

281
00:29:59,677 --> 00:30:00,357
Is that what it is?

282
00:30:00,377 --> 00:30:04,078
A motion to affirm?

283
00:30:04,098 --> 00:30:08,119
A motion to certify that there's approval not needed.

284
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:15,720
Okay, so actually, I guess I need a motion first.

285
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,101
I'll make a motion to affirm that approval is not needed.

286
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:20,682
Okay, a second.

287
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:22,202
I second.

288
00:30:24,403 --> 00:30:25,584
Vice Chair Emily Hederman?

289
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:26,784
Yes.

290
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:28,265
Ari Fishman?

291
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:31,626
Sally Akiki?

292
00:30:32,447 --> 00:30:32,707
Yes.

293
00:30:33,627 --> 00:30:35,368
Sherrod Batracharia?

294
00:30:35,928 --> 00:30:36,208
Yes.

295
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:38,289
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

296
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:39,009
I'm a yes.

297
00:30:39,349 --> 00:30:40,230
Thank you, Mr. Powell.

298
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,480
Thank you.

299
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,060
Thank you so much.

300
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:42,800
Thank you.

301
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,181
Have a great evening.

302
00:30:44,961 --> 00:30:51,942
So, so the board's aware this, so we have, do we have the, um, there's a, the tech, the details.

303
00:30:51,982 --> 00:30:53,523
We have the Mylar here in the office.

304
00:30:53,563 --> 00:30:54,143
Is that correct?

305
00:30:54,643 --> 00:30:59,724
So this literally did now I'm second guessing myself.

306
00:30:59,784 --> 00:31:08,026
There was something that we had said that I could sign on behalf of the board, or is this something that we actually need everybody to come in?

307
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:12,261
and physically sign it before the applicant can pick it up from us.

308
00:31:13,302 --> 00:31:15,703
This used to not be an issue with in-person meetings.

309
00:31:15,723 --> 00:31:27,473
I don't know if that was during COVID times, even though I feel like we're still in COVID times, that there was some permission, I think, given to you, but I don't.

310
00:31:28,713 --> 00:31:33,114
know if that is still I don't, I'll check and I'll get back to the board.

311
00:31:33,154 --> 00:31:38,635
But just so you're aware, we may need you all to come in and physically sign this.

312
00:31:39,095 --> 00:31:43,075
And if that's the case, then I'll ask Clem to just coordinate that with you all.

313
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:56,278
So sorry, it'll be it could take us a couple of days until next week till we can get all the signatures together to give you because you'll need this the Mylar with the signatures on it to go to the registry of deeds.

314
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:57,598
Okay, I understand.

315
00:31:57,658 --> 00:31:57,938
Thank you.

316
00:31:58,627 --> 00:31:59,868
Okay, great, thank you.

317
00:31:59,948 --> 00:32:02,089
I'll figure that out this evening.

318
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:04,511
Sorry, I didn't think of that beforehand.

319
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:18,039
Our next item is approval of minutes.

320
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:24,863
I'm not sure that everyone, so we have 9-6-23 and then 9-20-23 was added.

321
00:32:24,923 --> 00:32:27,345
Did everyone get a chance to read the additions?

322
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:31,318
So I don't know if I can do this collectively.

323
00:32:31,358 --> 00:32:32,860
Can we do it in one?

324
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,244
Or just say, I'm asking for a motion to approve draft minutes from 9-6 and 9-20 meetings?

325
00:32:41,906 --> 00:32:43,367
As long as there's no discussion, right?

326
00:32:44,168 --> 00:32:46,169
Yeah, as long as there's no discussion on either.

327
00:32:46,189 --> 00:32:50,793
All right, so I will ask for a motion to approve the draft minutes from 9-6-23 and 9-20-23.

328
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:00,362
My motion for approval is 9-6-2-10-18.

329
00:33:00,762 --> 00:33:02,263
And what's the next one?

330
00:33:02,283 --> 00:33:04,024
The 9-20?

331
00:33:04,905 --> 00:33:05,565
What's the date?

332
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:08,507
Yes, 9-20.

333
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:09,128
9-20.

334
00:33:09,168 --> 00:33:11,590
And I'll second.

335
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,911
Thank you.

336
00:33:14,412 --> 00:33:15,592
Vice Chair Emily Hedeman?

337
00:33:16,353 --> 00:33:16,593
Yes.

338
00:33:17,314 --> 00:33:17,994
Abby Fishman?

339
00:33:20,976 --> 00:33:21,777
Sally Akiki?

340
00:33:22,537 --> 00:33:22,798
Yes.

341
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,560
Sherrod Batracharian?

342
00:33:27,581 --> 00:33:28,962
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

343
00:33:28,982 --> 00:33:30,203
Okay.

344
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:32,405
Ms.

345
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:36,509
Salinas, are there any other updates from the city or anyone?

346
00:33:40,912 --> 00:33:41,833
No other updates?

347
00:33:43,675 --> 00:33:45,156
I was putting this in the chat.

348
00:33:45,296 --> 00:33:46,077
I found the letter.

349
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:53,523
So there's a letter from the board to the registry saying that

350
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,957
You give me the authority to sign.

351
00:33:58,777 --> 00:34:27,860
The Medford Community Development Board voted to approve the following resolution, Alicia Hunt, acting director, oh, we should change that, for the City of Medford's Office of Community Development is hereby authorized on behalf of the Medford Community Development Board under the subdivision control law, blah, blah, blah, to certify or endorse its approval or other action of any plan or other instrument required or authorized by the subdivision control law to be recorded and or to execute any agreement

352
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:34,784
or other document to secure the performance of any person or applicant under the subdivision control law.

353
00:34:35,444 --> 00:34:44,829
The preceding authorization shall be effective from the date of its approval by the Medford Community Development Board until notice of its revocation is provided by said board.

354
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:55,934
So I can sign it and we would provide a letter, a copy of this letter to the applicant, but this should be on file with the Registry of Deeds.

355
00:34:56,557 --> 00:35:03,259
And if you guys would prefer to sign these all yourself, you all can vote to revoke it and you can all do the signatures.

356
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,000
Yes, but we have it.

357
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:10,441
Thank you, sounds good to me.

358
00:35:14,303 --> 00:35:15,323
Any other updates?

359
00:35:18,164 --> 00:35:21,825
Danielle, do you have any idea what's coming down the line for us?

360
00:35:23,572 --> 00:35:34,316
Um, I expect that, um, 100 Winchester PD will be applying for their PD special permit soon as well.

361
00:35:34,596 --> 00:35:34,776
Um.

362
00:35:36,396 --> 00:35:37,717
Walking court is.

363
00:35:38,943 --> 00:35:46,545
Putting together their site plan review package, and we're going to try to get a jump on the review.

364
00:35:46,645 --> 00:36:00,570
So circulating it among department heads so that if, and when the PDD 3 is adopted by the city council that it'll be ready to go because we know that they're on a. Pretty ambitious timeline.

365
00:36:04,278 --> 00:36:07,099
And what else?

366
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:13,240
What I affectionately call the pit on Salem Street, 290 Salem Street.

367
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:25,482
There is a mixed use development that will be coming before you probably in the next month or so, if they are able to revise their drawings.

368
00:36:28,262 --> 00:36:30,623
But I think those are the major things for now.

369
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,791
Thank you.

370
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:40,738
And Madam Chair, I would just like to make sure that the Community Development Board knows that our office has three positions posted.

371
00:36:41,378 --> 00:36:49,567
We are looking for an economic development planner, an economic development director, and a staff planner focused on housing.

372
00:36:50,527 --> 00:36:51,907
primarily affordable housing.

373
00:36:53,068 --> 00:36:57,569
If you know anybody who might be interested in those positions, they are on the city's website.

374
00:36:58,169 --> 00:37:00,469
We'd appreciate any help recruiting.

375
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:04,570
I'm hoping to start interviewing for the staff planner positions very soon.

376
00:37:10,832 --> 00:37:11,232
Thank you.

377
00:37:11,592 --> 00:37:16,573
I was hoping, I thought you were getting closer to filling the economic development director.

378
00:37:18,225 --> 00:37:20,586
We had an excellent candidate who withdrew.

379
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:24,028
Oh, sorry.

380
00:37:24,048 --> 00:37:36,735
Yeah, we were, we asked her to meet with the mayor and she said she was going to pursue an opportunity that was more in line with her career goals, unfortunately, because we went to the mayor saying she's amazing.

381
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:37,416
You should hire her.

382
00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:38,456
We should hire her.

383
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:40,417
Yeah.

384
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:42,078
Heartbreak.

385
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:43,279
Yeah.

386
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:49,828
We're fun to work with, so people shouldn't be scared.

387
00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:55,753
The third floor, everything is chill on the third floor, City Hall.

388
00:37:57,814 --> 00:37:58,375
Duly noted.

389
00:37:58,435 --> 00:38:01,077
All right.

390
00:38:02,318 --> 00:38:04,580
So I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn.

391
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,903
This is Ari's favorite.

392
00:38:11,585 --> 00:38:12,246
Is there a motion?

393
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,982
I'll make a motion to adjourn.

394
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:16,924
Okay, second motion.

395
00:38:17,785 --> 00:38:18,847
I'll second on the name.

396
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,010
Okay, we've been doing it all night.

397
00:38:24,294 --> 00:38:25,757
Vice Chair Emily Hedeman?

398
00:38:26,478 --> 00:38:26,758
Yes.

399
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:28,320
Ari Fishman?

400
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,623
Okay.

401
00:38:31,324 --> 00:38:32,546
Sally Akiki?

402
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:33,407
Yes.

403
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,051
Sherrod Bacheria?

404
00:38:36,892 --> 00:38:37,152
Yes.

405
00:38:38,134 --> 00:38:39,456
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

406
00:38:39,936 --> 00:38:40,197
Yes.

407
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,639
Thank you, everyone.
